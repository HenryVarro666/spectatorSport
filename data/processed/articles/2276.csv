The package agreed today includes:

Targeted restrictive measures

Within the existing framework for sanctions, the EU will extend restrictive measures to cover all the 351 members of the Russian State Duma, who voted on 15 February in favour of the appeal to President Putin to recognise the independence of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk ”republics”.

Moreover targeted restrictive measures will be imposed on additional 27 high profile individuals and entities, who have played a role in undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. These include decision makers such as members of the government, who were involved in the illegal decisions; banks and businesspersons/oligarchs supporting financially or materially Russian operations in the Donetsk and Luhansk's territories, or benefitting from them; senior military officers, who played a role in the invasion and destabilisation actions; and individuals responsible for leading a disinformation war against Ukraine.

Restrictive measures include an asset freeze and a prohibition from making funds available to the listed individuals and entities. In addition, a travel ban applicable to the listed persons prevents these from entering or transiting through EU territory.

EU adopts sanctions package following Russia’s recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk

Restrictions on economic relations with the non-government controlled areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts

New measures will target trade from the two non-government controlled regions to and from the EU, to ensure that those responsible clearly feel the economic consequences of their illegal and aggressive actions.

Today's decision will introduce in particular an import ban on goods from the non-government controlled areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, restrictions on trade and investments related to certain economic sectors, a prohibition to supply tourism services, and an export ban for certain goods and technologies.

Financial restrictions

The Council decided to introduce a sectoral prohibition to finance the Russian Federation, its government and Central Bank. By restraining the ability of the Russian state and government to access the EU’s capital and financial markets and services, the EU aims to limit the financing of escalatory and aggressive policies.

The EU urges Russia to reverse the recognition of the non-government controlled areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, uphold its commitments, abide by international law and return to the discussions within the Normandy format and the Trilateral Contact Group. The EU also calls on other states not to follow Russia’s illegal decision to recognise this proclaimed independence.

The EU stands ready to swiftly adopt more wide-ranging political and economic sanctions in case of need, and reiterates its unwavering support and commitment to Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders.

The relevant legal acts, including the names of the persons concerned, will be published soon in the Official Journal.

The package consists of the measures outlined below.

Targeted restrictive measures

Within the existing framework for sanctions, the EU has designated all the 351 members of the Russian State Duma, who voted in favour of the appeal to President Putin to recognise the independence of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk ”republics”. This is in line with the UK’s plan to impose similar sanctions measures.

Moreover, 27 high profile individuals and entities have been designated. These include decision makers such as members of the government, who were involved in the decision to recognize the independence of the non-government controlled areas; banks (Bank Rossiya, PROMSVYAZBANK and VEB.RF, all three of which have already been designated by the US, while the UK has designated the first two banks) and certain businesspersons/oligarchs; senior military officers; and individuals accused of leading a disinformation war against Ukraine. Note that in relation to the designated banks, the EU is allowing Member States to grant licenses for the release or making available of funds for the wind-down of existing agreements (including correspondent banking arrangements) by 24 August 2022.

Restrictive measures include an asset freeze and a prohibition from making funds available to the listed individuals and entities. In addition, a travel ban applicable to the listed persons prevents them from entering or transiting through EU territory.

Restrictions on economic relations with the non-government controlled areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts

New measures will target trade from the non-government controlled areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk to and from the EU. These restrictions broadly mirror the restrictions that have been in place against Crimea and Sevastopol since 2014. In particular, the following restrictions have been imposed:

an import ban on goods from the non-government controlled areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, as well as a ban on associated financing and financial assistance;

restrictions on investment in the regions, including the purchase of land, the purchase of shares and securities of entities in the regions, entering into financing and joint venture agreements with entities in the regions, and the provision of investment services related to these activities;

a prohibition on the supply of tourism services;

an export ban for a wide array of goods and technologies (aimed at the transport, telecommunications, energy, and oil, gas and minerals sectors, but covering a wide range of goods that may impact many other sectors). The ban also prohibits the provision of technical services, financing and financial assistance related to these items for use in the regions; and

a ban on providing technical assistance, brokering, construction or engineering services directly relating to infrastructure in the non-government controlled areas within the transport, telecommunications, energy, and oil, gas and minerals sectors.

Note that the restrictions outlined above only apply to the “non-government controlled areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine”, signifying that trade with areas under Ukrainian government control is not affected.

Financial restrictions

The EU has introduced a sectoral prohibition aimed at restricting access to capital by the Russian Federation, its government and Central Bank, as well as entities acting on behalf or at the direction of the Central Bank of Russia.

As such, it will be prohibited to directly or indirectly purchase, sell, provide investment services for or assistance in the issuance of, or otherwise deal with transferable securities and money-market instruments issued after 9 March 2022 by Russia and its government or the Central Bank of Russia (or any person acting on behalf or at the direction of the Central Bank of Russia).

Furthermore, after 23 February 2022, it will be prohibited to directly or indirectly make or be part of any arrangement to make any new loans or credit to the persons outlined above. However, this prohibition will not apply to loans or credit for the financing of non-prohibited imports or exports of goods and non-financial services between the EU and any other country. There are also exceptions for loans that were agreed prior to 23 February, subject to fulfilment of certain conditions.

These restrictions are similar to the EU’s existing sectoral sanctions restrictions against certain Russian banks, oil companies and defence companies. However, unlike those previous measures, there is no minimum maturity period for the securities or loans that are restricted. Accordingly, a loan of any length, or a security of any maturity length, would be restricted if an exemption does not apply.

Further sanctions to come

Note that after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on the night to Thursday 24 February 2022, the Presidents of the EU Council and the European Commission have announced that they will “…outline a further sanctions package which is being finalised by the European Commission and which the Council will swiftly adopt”. We are monitoring the situation and will update this blog with further developments.",https://sanctionsnews.bakermckenzie.com/eu-adopts-sanctions-package-in-response-to-russian-recognition-of-the-independence-of-non-government-controlled-areas-of-the-donetsk-and-luhansk/

4,f69cb118-5118-4768-b1cc-0e256224c12e,[],,"Following the recognition by Russian President Putin of the Ukrainian provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent republics (and moving “peacekeeping troops” into those regions), the UK, EU and US have announced a first tranche of sanctions in response.

The US measures, referenced in this briefing, essentially block US persons from dealings with the Donetsk and/or Luhansk regions (the same US measures that apply in relation to Crimea).

UK measures

The UK measures announced today take a different approach, instead imposing asset freezes on:

5 Russian banks; and

3 prominent Russian individuals

The targeted banks are:

Bank Rossiya,

IS Bank,

JSC GenBank,

PJSC Promsvyazbank and

Black Sea Bank for Development and Reconstruction

The targeted individuals are:

Gennady Timchenko

Boris Rotenberg

Igor Rotenberg

These designations are a direct consequence of UK's decision last week to broaden its Russia sanctions designation criteria1. In themselves these measures are notable – all three of these individuals are prominent in Russia, extremely wealthy and close to Putin (Arkady Rotenberg is already designated), and the designation of banks is always significant in its effects. The key points for businesses to note are:

These three individuals own (and/or may be said to control) some very significant entities. Any person to whom UK sanctions apply who deals with these persons, or with businesses owned/controlled owned by them now risks committing an offence. Businesses with Russian counterparties should re-check the ownership/control of those counterparties to ensure that they are not impacted by these designations;

A designation of a bank can have particularly broad impacts; businesses should consider any direct or indirect association with these banks and, if there is any connection, consider whether it is viable to continue that relationship;

All three of the individuals named, and 4 of the 5 banks named, were already US SDNs. While making them also UK designated will increase the pressure on them (and businesses should take account of the UK designations), the impacts will not necessarily be felt by Russia, or by the individuals/entities concerned as anything more than a modest extension of measures already in place.

If there are further developments in Ukraine, it is widely expected that further measures will follow, although it will be for UK government to decide (likely in coordination with US, EU and Canada) what further developments trigger further rounds of sanctions. As to the measures, which be considered in future rounds:

UK has identified strategic sectors of the Russian economy at which sanctions (both individual designations and sectoral measures) may be aimed: chemicals, construction, defence, electronics, energy, financial services, transport and digital technologies, indicating that they will impact ""all companies and organisations of strategic importance to Russia"";

PM Johnson has also indicated that the package may include measures that would prevent Russian companies from trading in US Dollars or UK Pounds (but notably not Euros, notwithstanding that much Euro-clearing takes place in London). However he note that the biggest issues is ""Russian hydrocarbons"";

The UK also looks set to use 'Londongrad'– the class of influential Russians, including many close to Putin, who have invested much of their extensive wealth in London in property and businesses, often concealing their interests behind secretive companies in UK overseas territories – to apply pressure on President Putin. It has in the past week ended the 'Tier 1 visa scheme' designed to attract wealthy businesspeople to the UK. Additionally, the government is reported to have prepared a reform of the laws relating to company and property registers, to increase transparency of the ownership of UK companies and property, which Prime Minister Johnson has said will ""open up the Russian doll of property ownership and see who's behind everything"" – something for which transparency campaigners and anti-financial crime groups have long since campaigned.

EU measures

The EU has yet to table and approve its formal sanctions measures, but it has yesterday afternoon issued a statement from the Presidents of the European Council and European Commission which outlined the core elements of an agreed package as being measures:

to target those who were involved in the illegal Russian decision to recognise Donetsk and Luhansk,

to target banks that are financing Russian military and other operations in those territories,

to target the ability of the Russian state and government to access the EU’s capital and financial markets and services, to limit the financing of escalatory and aggressive policies,

and to target trade from the two breakaway regions to and from the EU, to ensure that those responsible clearly feel the economic consequences of their illegal and aggressive actions.

On 23 February 2022, the EU adopted Council Regulation (EU) 2022/263 imposing trade restrictions with the two Ukrainian separatist regions of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. The Decision includes a blanket import ban on all goods and services originating from non-government-controlled areas in the two regions. This follows Russia's recognition of the two regions as independent regions from Ukraine and the deployment of troops into the region on the same day.

The Decision also included an export ban of certain technology goods and the provision of certain services (see related state intervention).

In this context, the EU's press release notes: ""The EU stands ready to swiftly adopt more wide-ranging political and economic sanctions in case of need, and reiterates its unwavering support and commitment to Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders"".

The measure enters into force one day following its publication on the official gazette.

Germany freezes gas pipeline project with Russia

West fears full-scale invasion of Ukraine

MOSCOW/DONETSK/WASHINGTON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Western nations and Japan on Tuesday punished Russia with new sanctions for ordering troops into separatist regions of eastern Ukraine and threatened to go further if Moscow launched an all-out invasion of its neighbour.

The United States, the European Union, Britain, Australia, Canada and Japan announced plans to target banks and elites while Germany halted a major gas pipeline project from Russia in one of the worst security crises in Europe in decades.

Bitter about Ukraine's long-term goal to join NATO and claiming it as historic Russian land, Russian President Vladimir Putin has amassed more than 150,000 troops near Ukraine's borders, according to U.S. estimates, and ordered soldiers into the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk regions to ""keep the peace"".

The United States dismisses that justification as ""nonsense"".

""To put it simply Russia just announced that it is carving out a big chunk of Ukraine,"" U.S. Presidnt Joe Biden said on Tuesday.

""This is the beginning of a Russian invasion.""

Satellite imagery over the past 24 hours shows several new troop and equipment deployments in western Russia and more than 100 vehicles at a small airfield in southern Belarus, which borders Ukraine, according to U.S. firm Maxar.

The Ukrainian military said early on Wednesday one soldier had been killed and six wounded in 96 incidents of shelling by pro-Russian separatists in the east over the previous 24 hours. It said separatist forces used heavy artillery, mortars and Grad rocket systems.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian cancelled separate scheduled meetings with Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday as weeks of frantic diplomacy failed to end the crisis.

Plans announced by Biden to bolster Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania include sending 800 infantry soldiers and up to eight F-35 fighter jets to locations along NATO's eastern flank, a U.S. official said, but are a redistribution, not additions.

Putin did not watch Biden's speech and Russia will first look at what the United States has outlined before responding, according to Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, cited by Russian news agencies.

Putin said he was always open to finding diplomatic solutions but that ""the interests of Russia and the security of our citizens are unconditional for us.""

Moscow is calling for security guarantees, including a promise that Ukraine will never join NATO, while the United States and its allies offer Putin confidence-building and arms control steps to defuse the stand-off.

Lavrov brushed off the threat of sanctions.

""Our European, American, British colleagues will not stop and will not calm down until they have exhausted all their possibilities for the so-called punishment of Russia,"" he said.

GAS PIPELINE HALTED

In perhaps the most significant measure announced on Tuesday, Germany halted the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline owned by Russian state-owned gas giant Gazprom , a move likely to raise gas prices in Europe.

Built and awaiting German approval, the pipeline had been set to ease the pressure on European consumers facing record energy prices but critics including the United States have long argued it would increase Europe's energy dependence on Russia.

German Economy Minister Robert Habeck warned that gas prices in Europe were likely to rise in the short term. Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's former president and now deputy chairman of its Security Council, suggested prices could double.

""Welcome to the new world where Europeans will soon have to pay 2,000 euros per thousand cubic metres!"" he said on Twitter.

The Kremlin said it hoped the Nord Stream delay was temporary and Putin said Russia ""aims to continue uninterrupted supplies"" of energy to the world.

U.S. sanctions target Russian elites and two state-owned banks, excluding them from the U.S. banking system, banning them from trading with Americans, and freezing their U.S. assets. They also seek to deny the Russian government access to Western financing. read more

Biden said that while more sanctions were being prepared in the event of a full-scale invasion, it was critical to ensure such measures did not hurt Americans in the form of steeper energy costs.

On 22 February 2022, the United States announced new sanctions on Russia, blocking the property of two major Russian banks, dozens of their subsidiaries, and five individuals, and imposing additional restrictions on dealings in Russia's sovereign debt. Additionally, on 23 February 2022, the US imposed sanctions on Nord Stream 2. These sanctions, which President Biden described as closely coordinated with US allies and partners and subject to escalation, follow earlier measures imposed by the US and the UK following Russia's recognition of the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics as independent states.

The EU followed on 23 February 2022 with a package of sanctions including asset freeze designations of 351 members of Russia's State Duma as well as 27 individuals and entities including companies and individuals active in the Russian defense and media sectors and three Russian banks. It also imposed broad trade restrictions in relation to the non-government controlled areas of the Donetsk and Lugansk oblasts of Ukraine, and measures to restrict access to EU capital markets by the Russian State, its Government and Central Bank.

US Intensifies Sanctions

SDN Designations of VEB and PromSvyazBank, three individuals and five vessels

On 22 February 2022, OFAC designated Vnesheconombank (""VEB"") and PromSvyazBank (""PSB"") as Specially Designated Nationals (""SDNs""), as well as 42 of their subsidiaries. These banks and all the listed subsidiaries are now blocked, as are all other subsidiaries that are owned 50% or more in the aggregate (i.e., under the ""50% Rule"") by one or more blocked persons. VEB and all of its 50% Rule subsidiaries continue to be subject to Directive 1 of the US Sectoral Sanctions Identifications List.

Concurrently, OFAC issued two general licenses authorizing transactions otherwise prohibited by the new measures:

General License 3 authorizes (with conditions) all transactions that are ordinarily incident and necessary to the wind-down of transactions involving VEB and its 50% Rule subsidiaries until 12.01am EDT on 24 March 2022. Thus, for the duration of General License 3, US persons that engage in business with VEB and its 50% Rule subsidiaries, and non-US persons engaged in business with such entities having a US nexus (such as US dollar payments), have until 24 March to wind down that business, provided that such wind-down activity is consistent with General License 3 (i.e., generally, no new business, or transactions involving sanctioned parties other than VEB or its 50% Rule subsidiaries). This general license has no impact on the prohibitions of Directive 1 under EO 13662.

General License 2 authorizes (with conditions) transactions involving VEB and its 50% Rule subsidiaries related to the servicing of bonds issued before 1 March 2022 by the Central Bank, the National Wealth Fund, or the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation. This general license has no impact on the prohibitions of Directive 1 under EO 13662.

OFAC also designated three individuals on 22 February, and re-designated two others:

Denis Aleksandrovich Bortnikov , a Deputy President of Russian state-owned financial institution VTB Bank and a Chairman of the VTB Bank Management Board was designated. His father, Aleksandr Vasilievich Bortnikov, Director of the Federal Security Service (""FSB"") of the Russian Federation and a permanent member of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, was re-designated.

, a Deputy President of Russian state-owned financial institution VTB Bank and a Chairman of the VTB Bank Management Board was designated. His father, Aleksandr Vasilievich Bortnikov, Director of the Federal Security Service (""FSB"") of the Russian Federation and a permanent member of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, was re-designated. Petr Mikhailovich Fradkov , Chairman and CEO of PSB, was designated.

, Chairman and CEO of PSB, was designated. Vladimir Sergeevich Kiriyenko, who previously worked as a vice president at the Russian state-controlled company, Rostelecom, and is presently the CEO of VK Group, the parent company of Russia's top social media platform, VKontakte, was designated. His father, Sergei Vladilenovich Kiriyenko, First Deputy Chief of Staff of the Presidential Office, was re-designated.

Further, OFAC added five vessels owned by a designated subsidiary of PSB to the SDN List: Baltic Leader, Fesco Magadan, Fesco Moneron, Linda and Regas.

By operation of OFAC's 50% Rule, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by one or more SDNs, are also automatically blocked, whether or not they appear on the SDN List.

Trading in Russian Sovereign Debt

OFAC also amended Directive 1 under EO 14024, to prohibit participation in the secondary, as well as in the primary, market for ruble or non-ruble denominated bonds issued by, or the lending of ruble or non-ruble denominated funds to, the Central Bank, National Wealth Fund, or Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.1

Specifically, OFAC re-issued Directive 1 as Directive 1A, and added three entities to the Non-SDN Menu-Based Sanctions List (NS-MBS List):2 the Central Bank, the National Wealth Fund, and the Ministry of Finance. As a result, US financial institutions (the definition of which was expanded, but only for the purposes of Directive 1A) are now prohibited from participating in the secondary market for ruble or non-ruble denominated bonds issued after 1 March 2022 by any of these three entities. The 50% Rule does not apply to this measure.

Finally, the Secretary of the Treasury issued a Determination pursuant to EO 14024 naming the financial services sector of the Russian Federation economy as being subject to that EO. As a result, OFAC may designate under EO 14024 entities that operate in Russia's financial services sector. We would expect that the consequences of future listings under this authority would be limited to the application of this same Directive 1A, but the consequences could be a full blocking. This is similar to the existing authority under EO 13662, which has normally been used to apply Directive 1 to listed entities, even though the legal authority is broader. In an FAQ, OFAC clarified that the Treasury Secretary's determination regarding the financial services sector does not mean that those operating in it are all automatically sanctioned.3

OFAC has updated other FAQs to conform to the new sanctions measures: #891, #890, #889, #888, and #678.4

Nord Stream 2 Sanctions

On 23 February 2022, the White House announced additional sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG and its corporate officers. Specifically, OFAC has added Matthias Warnig, CEO of Nord Stream 2 AG to the SDN list, along with Nord Stream 2 AG itself.5 OFAC also issued General License No. 4 authorizing (with conditions) all transactions that are ordinarily incident and necessary to the wind-down of transactions involving Nord Stream 2 AG and its 50% Rule subsidiaries until 12.01am EDT on 2 March 2022. PEESA, the statutory authority on which these sanctions are based, also authorizes the US Department of State to deny and revoke visas to those blocked under its authority.

EU Adopts First Tranche of Sanctions

On 23 February 2022, the EU adopted a first package of new sanctions in response to Russia's recognition of the non-government controlled areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine as independent and sending Russian troops to the region. At the time of writing, the legal acts containing the details have yet to be published, but the EU has announced that these include:6
