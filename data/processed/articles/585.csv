Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng announced plans to phase-out the imports of Russian oil with plans on how to reduce the UK’s reliance on Russian gas also in the pipeline.

The decision to cut oil imports marks a significant escalation in Western sanctions against Moscow, which heavily relies on the sale of its oil and gas to finance its economy.

The announcement followed swiftly on the heels of US President Joe Biden’s decision to ban all oil imports as part of a coordinated effort by the West to punish Mr Putin’s regime for its invasion of Ukraine.

Mr Kwarteng said business should use the coming year to “ensure a smooth transition so that consumers will not be affected” following the Government’s move to ban oil imports.

He added that the Government will set up a new “taskforce on oil” to support companies to find new supplies of oil over the rest of the year.

“The UK is a significant producer of oil and oil products, plus we hold significant reserves,” the Business Secretary tweeted.

“Beyond Russia, the vast majority of our imports come from reliable partners such as the US, Netherlands and the Gulf. We’ll work with them this year to secure further supplies.”

According to ministers, the oil market has already begun to “ostracise” Russian oil following its brutal invasion of Ukraine, with 70 per cent of Russian oil reserves unable to find a buyer.

Mr Kwarteng also said he was exploring options to cut the UK’s 4 per cent of gas imports from Russian down to zero.

While the UK is less reliant on Russian oil than other European countries, it still makes up 8 per cent of all oil imports into the UK and 18 per cent of diesel imports.

The decision to phase in the ban on imports comes in a bid to avoid a major spike in prices at petrol forecourts.

It comes after the EU announced its own plans to dramatically scale back its use of Russian gas, cutting the amount it consumes from 150bn cubic metres to 50bn by the end of the year.

The White House was the first to move, with President Biden announcing plans to ban all Russian oil in what he described as a move to target “the main artery of Russian economy”.

In doing so he said the American people were dealing “another powerful blow to Putin’s war machine”.","https://inews.co.uk/news/world/russia-sanctions-uk-ban-russian-oil-import-west-tighten-squeeze-putin-ukraine-invasion-1505066#:~:text=The%20UK%20will%20ban%20the,following%20his%20invasion%20of%20Ukraine."

Summary Companies To phase out Russian oil by end 2022

To consider banning its natural gas

LONDON, March 8 (Reuters) - Britain will phase out imports of Russian oil and oil products by the end of 2022 and consider banning its natural gas, joining other countries, including the United States, in a move to punish Moscow over the invasion of Ukraine.

As part of the global response to the war, Britain and others are seeking ways to deprive Moscow of income and cut their own use of Russian energy exports by becoming more self-sufficient.

Britain's business minister Kwasi Kwarteng said he was exploring options to end British imports of Russian gas which accounts for about 4% of supply in the country.

""In another economic blow to the (Vladimir) Putin regime following their illegal invasion of Ukraine, the UK will move away from dependence on Russian oil throughout this year, building on our severe package of international economic sanctions,"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a statement.

""Working with industry, we are confident that this can be achieved over the course of the year, providing enough time for companies to adjust and ensuring consumers are protected.""

Russia describes its actions as a ""special operation"" to disarm Ukraine and unseat leaders it calls neo-Nazis.

Johnson has promised to set out a new energy supply strategy, as his government braces for the fallout from a 54% jump in consumer gas and electricity bills due in April, and higher prices at petrol pumps.

Business minister Kwarteng called on businesses to use the rest of this year to ensure a smooth transition, and said the government would set up a taskforce to work with firms to find alternative suppliers.

""This transition will give the market, businesses and supply chains more than enough time to replace Russian imports – which make up 8% of UK demand,"" Kwarteng said on Twitter.

""The UK is a significant producer of oil and oil products, plus we hold significant reserves... Finally, while the UK is not dependent on Russian natural gas - 4% of our supply - I am exploring options to end this altogether.""

Also on Tuesday, the European Commission published plans to cut the EU's dependency on Russian gas by two-thirds this year and end its reliance on Russian supplies of the fuel ""well before 2030"". read more

In a move likely to hit the Kremlin’s coffers hard, as well as further raise petrol prices and feed inflation in the west, Boris Johnson said stopping imports of Russian oil by the end of 2022 was “another economic blow to the Putin regime”.

Joe Biden announced a joint ban on Russian oil and gas imports, while the EU presented a plan to phase out gas imports only.

“Today I’m announcing the United States is targeting the main artery of Russia’s economy,” President Biden said in an address at the White House.

“We’re banning all imports of Russian oil and gas and energy. That means Russian oil will no longer be acceptable at US ports, and the American people will deal another powerful blow to Putin’s war machine.”

The sanctions are expected to be highly damaging to the Russian economy, with experts at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit saying the UK oil ban alone could cost Moscow more than £5bn this year.

The EU sources about 40% of its gas from Russia and 27% of its oil, while the US gets no gas from Russia and 7% of its oil. In Britain, 4% of gas and 8% of oil comes from Russia.

Analysts said the crackdown was expected to push up the price of fuel, with petrol already hitting a record 155p a litre this week in the UK, 24% higher than a year ago. Conservative MPs are clamouring for a reduction in fuel duty in this month’s spring statement as a result.

Johnson said consumers would be protected and the government said the transition to new suppliers of oil would be “smooth”, implying motorists have no need to queue at the pumps in a repeat of the autumn’s panic over fuel.

The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said the UK imports 13% of its diesel from Russia, and none of its petrol.

Johnson said: “We can certainly do it … in a way that doesn’t disrupt supply, that ensures we have substitute supplies on stream in an orderly way and in a timetable that won’t affect UK business, won’t affect UK manufacturing, road haulage or other parts of our industry but will punish the regime of Vladimir Putin.”

But Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “With supply constrained, while demand rockets for supplies from elsewhere in the world, it seems the only way is up for energy prices.”

She added: “There is no magic wand to wave to speed up the shift to renewables, and although the EU has pledged to accelerate the process of weaning member countries off Russia, it’s going to be a hugely difficult and expensive transition.”

Analysts at Credit Suisse warned that if oil hit $160 a barrel, it could drive inflation to 9.5% by October and push the UK into recession.

The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, will come under pressure to take fresh action to protect consumers from the cost of living squeeze, with higher oil prices having an impact across the economy.

Announcing the plan, Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, said he would establish a “taskforce for oil” to help companies. He said that the UK is a significant producer of oil, and alternative suppliers included “reliable partners such as the US, Netherlands and the Gulf”. Kwarteng also said he was “exploring options” for a total ban on Russian gas.

The government said Russian oil supplies would be “quickly” replaced by other suppliers as its products are already being ostracised by the market: nearly 70% of Russian oil currently struggles to find a buyer.

Labour backed the move. Ed Miliband, the shadow climate change secretary, said: “It is the right decision to ban imports of Russian oil. We need to do everything possible to isolate the Putin regime.”

BEIS is soon expected to publish an updated energy supply strategy including accelerated investment in renewables and a new round of North Sea licences to maximise extraction.

However, ministers remain deeply sceptical about fracking, which some Tories would like to see go ahead as the UK strives for energy independence.

Jacob Rees-Mogg, minister for Brexit opportunities, signalled support for a change in policy on Tuesday.

He called shale gas “very clean” and appeared to dismiss concerns about tremors caused by drilling, saying: “Some of the seismic effects are ones that can only be measured with sophisticated equipment. Others are equivalent to a bus passing by your house, assuming there’s a pavement in between you and the house. And as I say, it’s not the San Francisco earthquake.”

A BEIS source said fracking would not be restarted “until there is compelling scientific evidence that allows us to predict and manage earthquakes associated with it”. Some MPs in favour of fracking said it was possible the government could announce fresh research on its impact if they wanted to show it was being kept on the table.

The prime minister’s announcement of a ban on Russian oil was relatively abrupt given his comments on Monday that the west would have to take a phased approach to reducing reliance on Moscow’s oil and gas.

European countries including Germany, which is much more heavily reliant on Russian gas in particular, have been reluctant to move rapidly towards phasing it out.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/no-10-plans-cut-russian-fossil-fuels-use

government establishes a new joint taskforce with industry to work together on an orderly transition

move will increase the growing pressure on Russia’s economy by choking off a valuable source of income

The UK will phase out imports of Russian oil in response to Vladimir Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine by the end of the year, the Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has confirmed today (Tuesday 8 March).

The phasing out of imports will not be immediate, but instead allows the UK more than enough time to adjust supply chains, supporting industry and consumers. The government will work with companies through a new Taskforce on Oil to support them to make use of this period in finding alternative supplies.

The UK is working closely with the US, the EU and other partners to end our dependence on Russian hydrocarbons in response to Russian aggression in Ukraine, recognising the different circumstances and transition timelines.

The import of Russian oil makes up 44% of Russian exports and 17% of federal government revenue through taxation – this move steps up the international pressure on Russia’s economy.

In a competitive global market for oil and petroleum products, demand can be met by alternative suppliers. We will work closely with international partners to ensure alternative supplies of fuel products.

Russian imports account for 8% of total UK oil demand, but the UK is also a significant producer of both crude oil and petroleum products, in addition to imports from a diverse range of reliable suppliers beyond Russia including the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, and USA.

Whilst this transition takes place, the government recognises the need to continue to import Russia oil in the meantime as we work to this aim. This will help ensure continuity in our supply and protect consumers.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:

In another economic blow to the Putin regime following their illegal invasion of Ukraine, the UK will move away from dependence on Russian oil throughout this year, building on our severe package of international economic sanctions. Working with industry, we are confident that this can be achieved over the course of the year, providing enough time for companies to adjust and ensuring consumers are protected.

Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said:

Unprovoked military aggression will not pay and we will continue to support the brave people of Ukraine as they stand up to tyranny, building on our existing sanctions that are already crippling Putin’s war machine. We have more than enough time for the market and our supply chains to adjust to these essential changes. Businesses should use this year to ensure a smooth transition so that consumers will not be affected.

This significant move will increase the growing pressure on Russia’s economy by choking off a valuable source of income and hitting its ability to impose further misery on the Ukrainian people.

The elimination of oil imports is in addition to existing trade, financial and personal sanctions already imposed by the UK against Putin’s regime and those who support him in his war against Ukraine.

Russian oil is already being ostracised by the market, with nearly 70% of Russian oil currently struggling to find a buyer, and in a competitive global market demand will quickly be met by alternative suppliers. On 1 March Russian ships were banned from UK ports and authorities were granted new powers to detain Russian vessels.

The UK is not dependent on Russian natural gas, making up less than 4% of our supply. Ministers are also exploring options to reduce this further. The Prime Minister confirmed that the government will set out an energy strategy to set out the UK’s long term plans for greater energy security, including both renewable and domestic oil and gas supplies.

On Tuesday and Wednesday (8-9 March), the government set out plans to gradually reduce reliance on Russian energy imports, and increase domestic production of oil and gas, as well as renewable and nuclear energy supply.

“We must end our dependence on all Russian hydrocarbons,” Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told the House of Commons on Wednesday. “In the meantime, we need more investment in North Sea oil and gas,” he said.

A group of Conservative lawmakers are urging the government to relax its stance on fracking in order to stimulate domestic gas production, help plug the supply gap and mitigate against the high prices caused by the repercussions to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The Johnson government insists that any changes to its energy policy will not involve abandoning its carbon reduction commitments.

In response to a question about fracking from Labour’s energy spokesperson Ed Miliband, Kwarteng, who is known to be sceptical about fracking, told parliament that “the government has always been clear that we will take precautionary approach and support shale gas exploration if it can be done in a safe and sustainable way. That remains our position”.

Despite some initial enthusiasm about shale gas exploitation under David Cameron’s government, the UK fracking industry has remained small. The practice of hydraulic fracturing remains controversial and is associated with pollution of the nearby water supply and environment. The government introduced a moratorium on fracking since 2018 and the last remaining firm operating in the UK, Cuadrilla, has indicated that it will seal up its remaining wells.

However, the government now appears to be cautioning against this approach. A spokesperson for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Wednesday that the government would consider “all options” concerning energy supply.

“In conversation with my right honourable friend the prime minister, we were clear that it didn’t necessarily make any sense to concrete over the wells. We’re still in conversations about that,” Kwarteng told the House of Commons on Wednesday.

That represents something of a U–turn for Kwarteng, who tweeted earlier this week that “additional UK production won’t materially affect the wholesale market price. This includes fracking – UK producers won’t sell shale gas to UK consumers below the market price. They’re not charities.”

Although the UK imports less than 4% of its energy from Russia, making it far less dependent on Russian gas than many EU countries, it is highly vulnerable to supply and gas prices disruption. Britons are already facing hefty energy price increases of up to 54% after April, pushing the average annual bill up £693 to £1,971.

Kwarteng added that the new energy supply strategy would involve increases in renewable and nuclear energy production.

Energy supply questions, and the possibility of imposing bans on Russian oil and gas, are set to be discussed at an extraordinary meeting of G7 energy ministers on Thursday.

The move is expected to be announced at 1600 GMT and will lay out the ban and its phase-in period, which is expected to last about a year to try to stop people panic-buying fuel at a time when energy prices are rocketing.

Separately, the World Bank warned oil price hikes driven by the Russia-Ukraine war would slash growth for big importers.

Turkey relies on Russia for 45% of its natural gas demand, 17% of oil and 40% of its gasoline, Deputy Energy and Natural Resources Minister Alparslan Bayraktar said in remarks on the sidelines of the CERAWeek energy conference.

""The world needs more oil,"" Bayraktar said. ""It needs to come from somewhere, from the United States, from Venezuela, from Iran, Saudi Arabia, or wherever we need it to be,"" he added.

Bayraktar stressed Turkey could not easily replace its Russian oil supply from elsewhere and added, ""they have been old, reliable suppliers.""

The West’s moves to isolate Russia economically for attacking Ukraine have hit hard global commodity and energy markets, sending prices spiraling out and threatening to derail the nascent recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.

The U.S. on Tuesday stepped up its campaign to punish Moscow by banning Russian oil and energy imports. Britain too said it would ban imports of Russian oil but only by gradually phasing them out during 2022 to give businesses time to find alternative sources of supply.

The sanctions will have a ""terrifying"" effect on the global oil market, Bayraktar separately told Sputnik on the sidelines of the energy event in Houston, the U.S.

""It will be very difficult to replace Russia, the world’s largest oil producer, in the global market,"" the official said, noting that countries are in a position where they should increase oil production as the coronavirus pandemic is easing and the global economy is recovering.

""Actually, I don’t know what effect this decision will have. But the previous U.S. sanctions, including those on Iran, affected other markets and regions, including Turkey,"" Bayraktar said.

""These sanctions will also have some spillover effect on other countries and the region,"" he added.

War-driven price hikes to affect big importers

Persistent high-oil prices prompted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could cut a full percentage point off the growth of large oil-importing developing economies like China, Turkey, Indonesia and South Africa, a World Bank official said on Tuesday.

Indermit Gill, the bank’s vice president for Equitable Growth, Finance and Institutions, said in a blog posting that the war will deal further setbacks to growth for emerging markets already lagging in recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and struggling with a range of uncertainties from debt to inflation.

""The war has aggravated those uncertainties in ways that will reverberate across the world, harming the most vulnerable people in the most fragile places,"" Gill said.

""It’s too soon to tell the degree to which the conflict will alter the global economic outlook,"" he cautioned.

Some countries in the Middle East, Central Asia, Africa and Europe are heavily reliant on Russia and Ukraine for food, as the countries together make up more than 20% of global wheat exports.

Gill said estimates from a forthcoming World Bank publication suggest that a 10% oil price increase that persists for several years can cut growth in commodity-importing developing economies by a tenth of a percentage point.

Oil prices have more than doubled over the last six months.

""If this lasts, oil could shave a full percentage point of growth from oil importers like China, Indonesia, South Africa and Turkey,"" Gill warned.

""Before the war broke out, South Africa was expected to grow by about 2% annually in 2022 and 2023, Turkey by 2%-3%, and China and Indonesia by 5%,"" he said.

Inflation, current account risks

The war has raised inflation and current account risks for Turkey amid a slide in the Turkish lira.

The rise in commodity prices from oil to wheat due to the conflict are likely to lead to a larger deficit, while also further stoking inflation – already at 54%.

The lira declined for a seventh straight day on Wednesday, bringing its losses to more than 5% since Russia launched its attack on Ukraine.

The lira was down around 1.3% to stand at 14.65 against the U.S. dollar by 8:44 a.m. GMT, its weakest since Dec. 20, when the government announced a plan to protect lira deposits against currency depreciation.

The currency was broadly stable in the first two months of the year mainly thanks to the protection scheme following a 44% decline in 2021 and was hovering just below 14 against the dollar.

The currency topped 14 against when volatility returned in late February as the tensions between Moscow and Kyiv rose, before rebounding.

The government has been embracing a new economic plan that aims to turn Turkey’s chronic current account deficits into a surplus, raise growth, employment and exports while keeping low rates.

The drive was supported by the central bank’s easing cycle, which saw its benchmark policy rate reduced 500 basis points to 14% since September.

‘Cannot have another disruption’

Turkey previously imported about 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian crude before Washington decided in 2018 it would pull out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and reinstate sanctions.

""All of a sudden we went down to zero,"" Bayraktar said. ""And now we cannot have another supply disruption, this time in Russia,"" he warned.

Turkey is hoping Washington and Tehran will reach a deal soon that will bring Iran back into compliance with the 2015 nuclear accord.

The two countries have been in talks for almost a year to restore the deal which lifted sanctions on Iran.

""I hope this Iran issue will be sorted out soon,"" Bayraktar said and added, ""It will be much easier for us to cope with (supply).""

He stressed Turkey wants a stable energy market. ""We need our economies to grow. I do not think that this decision (sanctions on Russia) will in any way contribute to achieving this goal,"" he said.

The oil prices, which spiked even before the events in Ukraine, are expected to continue to rise due to Western sanctions on Russia, Bayraktar said.

The latest developments on the Russia-Ukraine war :

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. House overwhelmingly approved legislation that would ban Russian oil imports to the United States, an effort to put into law the restrictions announced by President Joe Biden in response to the escalating war in Ukraine.

Going further than Biden’s import ban on Russian oil, the bill making its way through Congress would also encourage a review of Russia’s status in the World Trade Organization and signal U.S. support for sanctions on Russian officials over human rights violations, as the U.S. works to economically isolate the regime.

Lawmakers in both parties have been eager to act, willing to risk higher gas prices at home in order to support Ukraine with a show of U.S. bipartisanship. The legislation was approved Wednesday, 414-17, and now goes to the Senate.

Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, who helped draft the bill, acknowledged it may cost more to fill up tanks at home to stop Russian President Vladimir Putin’s tanks abroad.

“It is one way to demonstrate our solidarity,” Doggett said during the debate.

TOKYO — Japanese electronics and entertainment giant Sony is suspending all shipments of its PlayStation video game consoles as well as game software to Russia because of the war in Ukraine.

Launch of “Gran Turismo 7,” a popular racing car game, is being suspended, and the PlayStation store in Russia will close, Sony Interactive Entertainment said in a statement Thursday.

The company “joins the global community in calling for peace in Ukraine,” it said.

Sony, which has movies and music businesses, earlier said it’s halted theatrical releases of its movies in Russia. Sony Group Corp. has also announced $2 million in humanitarian aid to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and the international aid group Save the Children to help war victims.

TOKYO — Japanese machinery and technology company Hitachi Group is suspending exports to Russia and has temporarily stopped manufacturing there.

Hitachi said Thursday products and services related to electric power equipment “indispensable to the daily lives of people” will continue. Operations in Ukraine have resumed by moving employees and families to safer areas, it said.

“Hitachi Group considers the safety and health of all employees and their families as its top priority. In Ukraine, the company is engaged in various activities to realize this goal and hopes that peace will return as soon as possible,” it said.

IRPIN, Ukraine — Hundreds of Ukrainians living in towns occupied by Russian troops on the outskirts of Kyiv fled Wednesday.

Streams of cars -- some fixed with white flags -- filed down the road, joined by lines of yellow buses marked with red crosses.

The Interior Ministry said about 700 people were evacuated from Vorzel and Irpin. People from three other Kyiv suburbs were unable to leave. Some who managed to get out said they hadn’t eaten in days.

“I forgot when I ate last,” said an Irpin resident who gave only her first name, Olena. “I’m so scared. I need to keep walking.”

Iuliia Bushinska, a Vorzel resident, said: “Occupiers came to our house and they were ready to shoot us.”

“They took away our house, our car, they took away our documents. So we need to start our life from the beginning. We survived things that I never experienced in my life,” Bushinska said.

WASHINGTON — The U.S. government publicly warned that Russia might seek to use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, after Russia, without evidence, accused Ukraine of having chemical weapons labs.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki called Russia’s claim “preposterous” and said it could be part of an attempt by Russia to lay the groundwork for using such weapons of mass destruction against Ukraine itself.

“This is all an obvious ploy by Russia to try to try to justify its further premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified attack on Ukraine,” said Psaki.

“Now that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them.”

Russia has used chemical weapons before in carrying out assassination attempts against Putin enemies like Alexey Navalny and former spy Sergei Skripal. It also supports the Assad government in Syria which has used chemical weapons against its people in a decade-long civil war.

LVIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on the West to impose even tougher sanctions on Russia after the airstrike on the maternity hospital in Mariupol.

“A genocide of Ukrainians is taking place,” Zelenskyy said Wednesday in his daily late evening video address to the nation. Wearing his now traditional wartime army green, he said the West should strengthen the sanctions so Russia “no longer has any possibility to continue this genocide.”

He said 17 people were injured in the attack, including pregnant women.

Mariupol has been blockaded by Russian troops for nine days. City officials said Wednesday that about 1,200 residents have been killed.

Zelenskyy again called on Western leaders to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine, something NATO members have refused to do for fear of provoking a wider war with Russia. Short of that, Zelenskyy called for the delivery of more fighter jets to Ukraine, a proposal the Pentagon rejected on Wednesday.

Zelenskyy said about 35,000 civilians have used humanitarian corridors to flee to western Ukraine to escape the fighting.

NEW YORK — Wall Street titan Citigroup said it would wind down its Russian banking business, with the ultimate goal of finding a seller. But the bank also acknowledged that selling the business may be difficult due to the Russian economy “being disconnected from the global financial system.”

Citigroup had a robust presence in Russia for several years, operating branches in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other major Russian cities. The company also did investment banking and business banking in the region.

Until the business is sold, Citi said it is “operating the business on a more limited basis” and is helping its U.S. and other corporate clients unwind or suspend their businesses in Russia.

Weeks before Russia invaded, Citi had announced it was leaving several Asian markets including Russia as part of a company-wide strategic review of its major markets. Citi is probably the most global of the Wall Street banks, operating consumer banking franchises in Asia, Latin America and Europe.

WASHINGTON — The Pentagon slammed the door Wednesday on any plans to provide MiG fighter jets to Ukraine, even through a second country, calling it a “high-risk” venture that would not significantly change the Ukrainian Air Force’s effectiveness.

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Polish counterpart on Wednesday and told him the U.S. assessment. He said the U.S. is pursuing other options that would provide more critical military needs to Ukraine such as air defense and anti-armor weapons systems.

Poland had said it was prepared to hand over MiG-29 planes to NATO that could then be delivered to Ukraine, but Kirby said U.S. intelligence concluded that it could trigger a “significant” Russian reaction.

LVIV, Ukraine — Russian aircraft bombed Zhytomyr on Wednesday evening, while artillery fire continued pounding the suburbs of Kyiv and Kharkiv, the country’s second largest city.

In Zhytomyr, a city of 260,000 to the west of Kyiv, bombs fell on two hospitals, one of them a children’s hospital, Mayor Serhii Sukhomlyn said on Facebook. He said the number of casualties was still being determined.

“Oh, this is a hot night,” he said in a video address to city residents. “Russia understands that it is losing strategically, but we have to hold out.”

Russian artillery shelled Kharkiv, destroying a police headquarters, killing at least four people and wounding 15, prosecutors office representative Serhii Bolvinov said on Facebook. He said since the invasion began nearly two weeks ago, 282 city residents have been killed, including six children.

After darkness fell, Russian artillery again began shelling Kyiv suburbs.

“Russian troops are methodically turning our life into a hell. People day and night have to sit underground without food, water or electricity,” the head of the Kyiv region, Oleksiy Kuleba, said on Ukrainian television.

UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations has received official notification from Ukraine that it intends to withdraw about 250 troops serving in the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Congo as well as military equipment, including some aircraft.

U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric confirmed the withdrawal on Wednesday stressing that every country has a right to withdraw military forces contributed to peacekeeping operations. He acknowledged “the tremendous role Ukraine has played, especially on issues of transport and helicopters.”

Dujarric said it is up to the Ukrainian government to explain why it asked to pull out the troops and the U.N. will be contacting other countries to replace the troops and equipment in the Congo mission known as MONUSCO which has about 17,800 personnel.

The U.N. spokesman said Ukrainians remain present in smaller numbers in other U.N. peacekeeping missions — 13 in South Sudan, 12 in Mali, five in Cyprus, four in Abyei and three in the U.N. political mission in Kosovo.

WASHINGTON — U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that President Volodymr Zelenskyy has told her that it will take “everybody’s help” in rebuilding Ukraine after the war with Russia.

Pelosi said she had a more than 45 minute call Wednesday with Zelenskyy. She said the Ukrainian president again asked for U.S. help in sending warplanes, anti-aircraft missiles and tanks to fight the Russian invasion.

But Pelosi said Zelenskyy also told her: “We’re going to need everybody’s help in rebuilding Ukraine as soon as we end this war.”

Pelosi said she hopes the U.S. can help facilitate the transfer of Soviet-era MiG fighter planes that Ukraine has requested from neighboring NATO allies. But she noted there’s a school of thought that suggests anti-aircraft missiles could also help Ukraine in its fight against Russia.

The Pentagon has rejected the idea of sending any fighter jets to Ukraine.

UNITED NATIONS — Russia’s “illegal, unprovoked” and “cruel” war against Ukraine is underscoring the many different ways in which peace, security and a stable climate are linked, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said Wednesday.

Kerry told an informal U.N. Security Council meeting on Climate Finance for Sustaining Peace that “the crisis in Ukraine really does underscore the risks that we face in the current volatile and uncertain energy markets.”

The U.S. special presidential envoy for climate said in a virtual speech that “Russia has attacked a nuclear facility in Ukraine, dangerous in and of itself, risky.”

There was increasing concern Wednesday over the safety of the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant, which Russian troops seized early in the invasion and which lost power and had to revert to backup generators. And there is also concern about the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the largest in Europe, which Russia seized last week.

The United States is responding by banning the import of Russian oil, liquefied natural gas and coal, “and many other nations are now rethinking their reliance on Russian energy sources,” Kerry said. The “instability, conflict, death destruction” in Ukraine is happening in the context of “a global existential crisis” of global warming that scientists have warned about for decades, he said.

“We are actually living through the consequences of that crisis,” Kerry said.

WASHINGTON — The United Arab Emirates said Wednesday it will urge OPEC to consider boosting oil output.

The announcement followed a U.S. ban on imports of Russian oil, the latest in a series of sanctions designed to punish Russia for the war in Ukraine. Oil prices have risen sharply since Russia — the world’s third-largest oil producer — invaded Ukraine late last month.

“We favor production increases and will be encouraging OPEC to consider higher production levels,” UAE’s ambassador to the United States, Yousef Al Otaiba, said in a statement posted on his embassy’s website. He said his country believes that stability in energy markets is critical to the global economy.

The UAE is a longtime member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which last week, along with its oil-producing allies including Russia, said it was sticking to its plan to gradually increase oil production rather that opening the spigots further.

The UAE was the world’s seventh-largest oil producing nation in 2020, according to U.S. Department of Energy figures published in December of last year.

Oil prices surged Tuesday after President Joe Biden announced the U.S. ban on Russian oil. But the possibility of increased OPEC output helped send prices tumbling Wednesday. A barrel of U.S. crude oil dropped 11% to $110.12.

BERLIN — The head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog said he will travel to Antalya in Turkey on Thursday at the invitation of Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu as concerns rise over the security of Ukraine’s nuclear reactors.

Cavusoglu will host a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers in Antalya as the two-week-long war in Ukraine claims more victims. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi tweeted Wednesday evening that he will attend meetings and hopes “to make progress on the urgent issue of ensuring the safety and security of #Ukraine’s nuclear facilities. We need to act now!”

Concerns rose Wednesday over the safety of the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant, which Russian troops seized early in the invasion and which lost power and had to revert to backup generators. The state communications agency said the power outage could put systems for cooling nuclear material at risk. The site has been under control of Russian troops since last week.

Ukraine’s nuclear regulator said remote data transmission from monitoring systems at Chernobyl has been lost.

The Vienna-based U.N. nuclear watchdog said it saw no critical impact on safety at Chernobyl because there could be “effective heat removal without need for electrical supply” from spent nuclear fuel at the site.

SEATTLE — Amazon said it will suspend shipments of products sold on its website to customers based in Russia and Belarus.

The e-commerce giant said late Tuesday in a blog update on its website that it will also suspend Prime Video access for customers based in Russia and will stop taking orders for New World, the only video game the company says it sells directly in the Russia. The retailer added new Russia and Belarus-based third-party sellers won’t be able to sell on its site.

The retailer had said earlier in the day that its cloud computing network, Amazon Web Services, will also stop allowing new sign-ups in Russia and Belarus. Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov had called on the company to stop providing AWS in Russia, suggesting in a letter sent to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos that not doing so could be supporting “bloodshed and disinformation that can be leveraged through digital infrastructures.”

WASHINGTON — U.S. gasoline prices hit another record on Wednesday, with the national average rising to $4.25 a gallon, an overnight increase of eight cents, according to the AAA auto club.

Motorists in California continue to pay the highest prices, with the statewide average at $5.57 a gallon. Prices topped $4.50 in Illinois, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Alaska and Hawaii.

Gasoline prices have been rising for nearly two years, following the trend in oil prices. Production fell at the outset of the pandemic, and producers have not pumped enough oil since then to meet rising demand.

The national average for gas has spiked 60 cents in just the past week, which analysts say is almost entirely due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which led President Joe Biden to announce Tuesday that the U.S. will ban the import of Russian oil.

WASHINGTON — The Pentagon said Wednesday that two U.S. Army Patriot air defense batteries have been shifted from Germany to Poland as a precautionary defensive move.

TIRANA, Albania — The U.S. Special Operations Command Europe, or SOCEUR, opened its forward-based headquarters in Albania on Wednesday, aiming at enhancing regional stability, its head Maj. Gen. David Tabor said.

A 12- to 15-member Task Force Balkans group will be based in Tirana to coordinate joint and combined exchange training and civil military support element engagements, Tabor said. Tabor said Albania’s central location in the Balkans was behind the decision to open the command there, he said.

It will be the first-ever U.S. permanent military presence in Albania, said U.S. Ambassador in Tirana Yuri Kim.

Albanian senior officials said that opening such a U.S. military office is more important now.

The opening of the command in Tirana “came at the proper moment, at the culmination of the insecurity due to the gloomy situation in the continent after Russian aggression,” said Defense Minister Niko Peleshi.

PRAGUE — The Czech government has agreed to give refugees from Ukraine free access to the labor market without any work permit.

Labor and Social Affairs Minister Marian Jurecka said Wednesday that the refugees will be in a position “of any other citizen” if they want to get a job.

The refugees will only need to get a visa for their stay in the Czech Republic to work. Assistance centers in all regions of the Czech Republic are working around the clock to provide all necessary documents and other initial help, including housing, to the refugees.

It’s estimated some 150,000 people have arrived in the country that doesn’t border Ukraine invaded by the Russian troops.

Jurecka said there are some 350,000 jobs currently available in the Czech Republic.

The government also approved a plan to give all the refugees a financial contribution of $215 on arrival. They would be able to receive it monthly six times if needed.

NICOSIA, Cyprus — Cyprus said the first 165-ton batch of humanitarian aid for the people of Ukraine has been shipped to Poland via the Greek port city of Thesaloniki.

The foreign ministry said in a statement Wednesday that the shipment will reach a European Union logistics hub set up in conjunction with Polish authorities.

The aid — collected mainly from individual donations — includes 88 tons of foodstuffs, sleeping bags, tents blankets and portable toilets, 5,000 pairs of shoes, bottled water, an electricity generator, personal hygiene kits and 14 tons of medical supplies.

The aid is a “tangible demonstration of the solidarity of Cyprus to the Ukrainian people,” the ministry said. Freight costs were covered by the ministry.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed Ukrainian “nationalists” for hampering the evacuation of civilians from besieged Ukrainian cities.

The Kremlin said that Putin discussed the situation in Ukraine in Wednesday’s phone call with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, with a “special emphasis given to the humanitarian aspects.” It said that Putin told Scholz about Russian “efforts to organize humanitarian corridors for civilians to exit areas of fighting and attempts by militants from nationalist units to hamper safe evacuation of people.”

Ukrainian officials said that the continuous Russian shelling has derailed efforts to evacuate civilians from areas affected by fighting.

LONDON — British American Tobacco said it has suspended all planned capital investment in Russia but continues to operate there, even as many other Western brands announce they’re halting all business in the country because of the Ukraine invasion.

The company, one of the so-called Big Four tobacco producers, said Wednesday that it has a “duty of care” to all its 2,500 employees in Russia. BAT said it’s focusing on its locally produced tobacco products in Russia, where it has substantial manufacturing and has been operating since 1991.

“Furthermore, we are scaling our business activities appropriate to the current situation, including rationalising our marketing activities,” the company said, adding it’s complying with all international sanctions related to the conflict.

The company said it is “deeply concerned about the conflict in Ukraine,” where it employs 1,000 people and has suspended all business and manufacturing.

In contrast, another major tobacco producer, Imperial Brands, said earlier Wednesday it would halt all operations in Russia, including production at its factory in Volgograd and ceasing all sales and marketing activity.

Separately, S&P Global Ratings said it has suspended commercial operations in Russia. The credit rating agency said it would maintain analytical coverage from outside Russia.

LYIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian officials say a Russian strike has hit a children’s hospital and maternity facility in the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol.

A statement on the city council’s social media account on Wednesday said the hospital suffered “colossal” damage.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy tweeted that there were “people, children under the wreckage.” He called the strike an “atrocity.”

The deputy head of Zelenskyy’s office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, said authorities are trying to establish the number of people who may have been killed or wounded.

GENEVA — The international Red Cross says civilians caught up in places affected by fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces should have “broader relocation alternatives” for evacuation – including to other parts of Ukraine – beyond the Russian government’s offer to take them into Russian territory.

The International Committee of the Red Cross, which in particular is trying to arrange evacuations of civilians from the hard-hit port city of Mariupol, made the comments Wednesday after Russia offered in recent days to allow safe-passage corridors for Ukrainian civilians across the Russian border. Ukrainian authorities have rejected that idea.

ICRC has said authorities on both sides need to agree on any evacuation plan, and evacuations should be voluntary for the civilians concerned.

Some civilians might refuse evacuation “if the only escape route available to them implies resettling in the Russian Federation or the Republic of Belarus,” said ICRC spokesman Jason Straziuso in an email, referring to Russian ally Belarus. “In the view of the ICRC, civilians affected by the hostilities should be given broader relocation alternatives, including within Ukraine itself.”

NEW YORK — Russia has admitted that conscript soldiers have been sent into Ukraine and that some have been captured by Ukrainian troops.

The admission comes after President Vladimir Putin vowed that conscripts would not be deployed and that Russian forces would rely on professional troops.

Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said that “unfortunately there have been detected several instances of the presence of conscript-service military personnel” with units in Ukraine but that “almost all” of them had been recalled to Russia.

He added that some conscripts were taken prisoner by Ukrainian forces while serving in a logistics unit and efforts are under way to free them. Konashenkov didn’t specify how many conscripts had served in Ukraine or how many were captured.",https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-cd8d100194423e647d07e4d6c226acbc
