The Ukrainians undergoing training on the Switchblades and other weaponry number less than a dozen. They had arrived in the United States for regular military education programs prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.

""We took advantage of the opportunity to pull them aside for a couple of days and provide them some training, particularly on the Switchblades UAV,"" the senior U.S. defense official told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""UAV"" refers to an unmanned aerial vehicle.

The United States withdrew its military advisers from Ukraine ahead of Russia's invasion, seeking to avoid a direct military confrontation between U.S. and Russian forces that could escalate into a broader war.

As a result of the withdrawal, the United States and NATO have largely constrained their provision of weaponry to Ukraine to systems that Ukrainian forces knew how to operate prior to Russia's invasion.

That includes U.S. weapons that have given Ukraine an edge against Russian forces, like Javelin anti-tank missiles and portable Stinger surface-to-air missiles that can target Russian aircraft. It also includes Soviet-era systems that are still in the inventories of some NATO nations.

But Switchblades, which are relatively easy-to-use and could be highly effective in attacking Russian ground forces, had not been part of training packages prior to Russia's invasion. The drones are made by AeroVironment Inc(AVAV.O).

The drones, which have a range of 40 km (25 miles), can be used against vehicles including trucks, tanks and armored personnel carriers.

In recent testimony, the assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, Celeste Wallander, said the United States had committed to sending Ukraine 100 Switchblade systems.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Tuesday that the Pentagon is sending Ukraine two variants of the Switchblade, including one with an anti-armor warhead.

""The Switchblade 600 and 300 will move as quickly as they possibly can,"" Austin told the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee.

Ukrainians are expected to quickly use the first 100 systems sent.

""I'm convinced that when we get the first set of Switchblades in, there will be an immediate request from the Ukrainians for more,"" the top U.S.commander in Europe, Air Force General Tod Wolters, told Congress on March 30.

The senior U.S. official declined to say on Wednesday where in the United States the training of Ukrainians was taking place or offer more information on other weapons systems they're being trained on.

""Our expectation is that these individuals will be heading back into Ukraine relatively soon as they were originally anyway,"" the official told reporters.

Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III disclosed the training for the first time in House testimony on Tuesday. Pentagon officials offered more details on Wednesday about what the military calls Switchblade drones and how U.S. officials are instructing a cadre of Ukrainian troops to use them on the battlefield.

The Pentagon announced last month that it was sending 100 Switchblade drones to Ukraine as part of a $800 million military aid package to Ukraine. More are on the way. Military officials call the weapon, which is carried in a backpack, the “kamikaze drone,” because it can be flown directly at a tank or a group of troops and is destroyed when it hits the target and explodes.

Bigger armed drones, like U.S.-made Predators or Reapers, would be difficult for Ukrainians to fly and would be easily destroyed by Russian fighter planes. But Pentagon officials said the small, portable kamikaze drones could prove to be a more cost-effective and elusive weapon against Russian armored convoys.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/06/world/europe/us-ukraine-switchblade-drones.html

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Wednesday that Ukraine has a particularly ""urgent"" need for Javelin portable anti-tank systems, and a senior Pentagon official elaborated that the ""urgent need for Javelins"" and the larger $100 million package is because ""Ukrainians wanted to make sure that they're ready for increased Russian activity"" in the Donbas. Kirby also said the U.S. military has trained a ""very small number"" of Ukrainian soldiers in the U.S. to use the Switchback drones.

This ""very small number"" of Ukrainians, ""less than a dozen,"" were already in the U.S. for professional training, ""and we took advantage of the opportunity to pull them aside for a couple of days and provide them some training, particularly on the Switchblade UAVs,"" the senior Pentagon official said. ""That is a system that is not organic to the Ukrainian military,"" though it's ""not a very difficult system to operate,"" and ""our expectation is that these individuals will be heading back into Ukraine relatively soon, as they were originally anyway.""

The U.S. has been getting the weapons to Ukraine ""incredibly fast,"" anywhere from ""four to six days has been the average of getting stuff from literally, from taking off from the states and getting into Ukrainian hands,"" the Pentagon official said. Such transfers have ""never been done that fast before,"" Kirby agreed.

The Pentagon official also suggested that the U.S. might help Ukraine's military with fuel, since Russia has been targeting fuel depots. ""I will just tell you that we have had discussions with the Ukrainians about fuel needs and fuel requirements. And those discussions are ongoing. And I'll leave it at that.""

That comment deserves ""special notice,"" tweeted Phillips O'Brien, a professor of strategic studies at Scotland's University of St. Andrews. It ""looks like the U.S. is going to do what they can to get them the fuel to operate. Maintaining Ukrainian mobility in the Donbas will be crucial.""",https://theweek.com/russo-ukrainian-war/1012266/us-is-training-ukrainian-officials-to-use-their-new-switchblade-drones

A shipment of 100 Switchblade UAVs, announced several weeks ago and supplied from U.S. military stock, arrived in Ukraine earlier this week, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby told reporters Wednesday.

“An individual could be suitably trained on how to use the Switchblade drone in about two days or so.” Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby

The precision, single-use Switchblade drones are a hybrid weapon, or “a kind of piloted missile that can also be a scout,” said an article in Popular Science.

The short-range piloted missiles are launched from a tube like a mortar and come in two sizes: the Switchblade 300 is nearly 6 pounds, while the Switchblade 600 weighs in around 120 pounds. They’re considered “loitering munitions,” and can change course mid-flight.

If Switchblades are successful, however, they don’t fly back.

The drones augment Ukraine’s existing supply of tactical armed UAVs, such as the Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 drone, which have played a critical role in Ukraine’s fight against invading Russian forces. The TB2s are capable of carrying up to four laser-guided munitions that have a reputation for being effective against ground-based targets, such as Russian tanks and mobile air defense systems.

At the onset of the war, Ukraine had at least a dozen of the TB2 systems it purchased in 2019, with reports suggesting it could have up to around 48 total, according to a report by Lauren Kahn, an expert with the Council on Foreign Relations.

Kirby said he would not comment on the specific Switchblade variants sent to Ukraine, but said U.S. military officials were “going to keep talking to them and working with—and helping them get additional ones if they need it.”

The Switchblade system is not one the Ukrainian military typically uses, he noted.

“It is not a very complex system. It doesn’t require a lot of training,” Kirby said. “An individual could be suitably trained on how to use the Switchblade drone in about two days or so.”

A “very small number” of Ukrainian soldiers who had been in the U.S. for military educational purposes since last fall were trained to use the Switchblade UAV system, he said. “We took the opportunity to—having them still in the country, to give them a couple of days’ worth of training on the Switchblade,” so they could train others when they returned to Ukraine, he said.

Tuesday, President Biden authorized an additional $100 million in military aid. “This $100 million is designed to help us meet an urgent Ukrainian need for additional Javelin anti-armor systems, which the United States has been providing to Ukraine,” Kirby said.

The aid package comes close on the heels of a $300 million security assistance package announced by the Department of Defense (DOD) last Friday and earmarked for armored vehicles, laser-guided rocket systems, ammunition and gear, as well as drones. Aerial systems in the DOD package include Switchblades, as well as Puma surveillance drones, a 15-pound, hand-launched UAV equipped with optical and infrared cameras

Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, the U.S. has committed more than $1.7 billion in security assistance, according to DOD.",https://www.flyingmag.com/ukrainian-soldiers-trained-to-use-switchblade-drones-in-u-s/

The “very small number” of Ukrainian soldiers, who have been in the U.S. since last fall for military training, were taught to use the drone with the expectation that they would soon return to their country to train others on the equipment, press secretary John Kirby told reporters.

“We took the opportunity — having them still in the country — to give them a couple of days’ worth of training on the Switchblade so that they can go back — and they will be going back soon, back home — to train others in the Ukrainian military,” Kirby said.

A senior U.S. defense official told reporters earlier on Wednesday that less than a dozen Ukrainian military personnel had been trained.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin confirmed a day prior that Switchblades are being sent to Ukraine as part of a $300 million lethal aid package announced by the Pentagon on Friday. He did not say how many, though multiple outlets have reported that 10 of the drones will be delivered.

Bloomberg reported that those Switchblades would be a newer, more advanced “series 600” version of the drones, which weigh about 50 pounds, can fly more than 24 miles, stay aloft for 40 minutes and are equipped with a heavier warhead that can damage tanks.

Kirby on Wednesday would not say whether the Switchblade-600 would be sent to Ukraine.

The White House has already sent 100 of the drones as part of an $800 million weapons package announced last month, but those Switchblades were the “series 300” versions. That variant weighs less than five pounds, can fly about six miles, hover over a target for about 15 minutes and is designed to attack personnel and light vehicles.

Kirby said those 100 aerial systems arrived in Europe earlier this week and will “be getting into Ukraine quickly, if they aren’t already there.”

As Ukrainian forces don’t typically use the Switchblade, some training will be needed, he added. “It is not a very complex system. It doesn’t require a lot of training. An individual could be suitably trained on how to use the Switchblade drone in about two days or so.”

Kirby also said Ukrainians were not being trained by the U.S. military on other weapons but would not rule out such assistance moving forward.",https://thehill.com/policy/defense/3260827-u-s-training-small-number-of-ukrainian-troops-on-switchblade-drones/

Defense Department spokesman John Kirby said it was a “very small” number of Ukrainian troops who were already present in the US before Russia invaded their country.

“We took the opportunity, having them still in the country, to give them a couple of days’ worth of training on the Switchblades, so they can go back… to train others in the Ukrainian military,” according to Kirby.

He said the 100 drones, which are essentially remotely controlled flying bombs that are crashed into targets where they explode, have been sent to Ukraine to bolster the military’s fight against Russian troops.

“They arrived over there earlier this week. So they’ll be getting into Ukraine quickly if they aren’t already there,” Kirby said, adding that the number of Ukrainian trainees was less than a dozen.

President Joe Biden announced on March 16 that, among other weaponry and munitions Washington was shipping to the Ukrainians, it would start sending the Switchblades.

Named for the way their wings unfold when launched, Switchblades are called loitering munitions, because they can be flown to target areas and held there until the right moment when a target is identified.

The operator then flies them into the target where they explode.

The original version, small enough to carry in a backpack, was used by US forces in Afghanistan.

A larger version, with enough explosives to take out armored vehicles, has also been developed. But the Pentagon would not say which one has been sent to Ukraine, if not both.

Meanwhile the United States announced Tuesday it was releasing another $100 million worth of military aid to Ukraine as its forces push Russians out of the Kyiv region.

Six weeks after Russia invaded and tried to quickly capture the capital, Kirby said they failed and had “completely withdrawn” from the Kyiv area as well as Chernigiv to the north.

Moscow has indicated it is preparing to intensify fighting in eastern and southern Ukraine, where its forces hold major chunks of territory.

But Kirby said the Pentagon had not yet seen a significant influx of reinforcement troops into that region, particularly the pro-Moscow Donbas area.",https://www.thedefensepost.com/2022/04/06/ukraine-soldiers-drone-training-us/
