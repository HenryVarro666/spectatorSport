Russian forces struck Ukrainian cities from a distance again on Friday, hitting sites in the capital Kyiv and the country's west as their ground offensive inched forward under fierce Ukrainian resistance.

The war launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin ground into its fourth week as his troops have failed to take Kyiv - a major objective in their hopes of forcing a settlement or dictating the country's future political alignments.

Missiles and shelling struck the edges of Kyiv as well as Lviv, close to Ukraine's western border with NATO countries such as Poland.

Late Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nighttime video address to the nation that he is thankful to U.S. President Joe Biden for additional military aid but won't say specifically what the new package includes because he doesn't want to tip off Russia.

Foreign ministers of the Group of Seven leading economies meanwhile said in a joint statement that Russian President Vladimir Putin is conducting an “unprovoked and shameful war.”

The fighting has led more than 3 million people to flee Ukraine, the U.N. estimates. The death toll remains unknown, though Ukraine has said thousands of civilians have died.

Here are some key things to know about the conflict:

WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THE GROUND?

The Ukrainian air force's western command said that six missiles were launched at Lviv from the Black Sea, but that two of them were shot down.

The city's mayor, Andriy Sadovyi, said the missiles hit a facility for repairing military aircraft near Lviv's international airport, also damaging a bus repair facility. No casualties were immediately reported. The facility had suspended work ahead of the attack, the mayor said on the Telegram messaging app.

Early morning barrages also hit on the northern edges of Kyiv. At least one person was killed by shelling on Podil, a neighborhood just north of downtown Kyiv, according to emergency services. It was not immediately known what was hit in the bombardment.

Civilian casualties have been mounting. The United Nations says that so far it has recorded 780 killed and 1,252 injured, although it estimates actual casualties are much higher. It says that most of the civilian casualties were due to explosive weapons with a wide impact area, such as heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems as well as missile and air strikes.

Ukrainian officials say thousands of civilians have been killed.

The World Health Organization has verified 43 attacks on hospitals and health facilities, with 12 people killed and 34 injured, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the United Nations Security Council in a virtual briefing Thursday.

The besieged southern city of Mariupol has borne much of the bombardment. There, rescuers continue to search for survivors of a Russian airstrike on a theater where hundreds of people were sheltering, local officials said.

With communications disrupted across the city and movement difficult because of shelling and other fighting, there were conflicting reports on whether anyone had emerged from the rubble.

Video and photos provided by the Ukrainian military showed that the building had been reduced to a roofless shell, with some exterior walls collapsed. Petro Andrushchenko, an official with the mayor's office, said the building had a relatively modern basement bomb shelter designed to withstand airstrikes.

Meanwhile, Britain's Defense Ministry said Thursday that Russia's invasion “has largely stalled on all fronts” amid stiff Ukrainian resistance. It said Russian forces have made “minimal progress” on land, sea or air in recent days, and are suffering heavy losses.

Ukrainian forces are using inexpensive Turkish-made drones to carry out lethal attacks on the Russian invaders.

WHAT HAS THE AP DIRECTLY WITNESSED OR CONFIRMED?

Smoke could be seen rising from the western part of the capital Kyiv after an early morning barrage Friday. Outside Lviv, black smoke billowed for hours after the early morning strike by several missiles,

A soldier standing guard near the site of the strike in Lviv said he heard three blasts in quick succession around 6 a.m. He said he had not heard of any casualties. A nearby resident described his building vibrating from the explosions and people panicking. Smoke continued to rise from the site almost three hours later.

The attacks in Mariupol knocked out the windows of apartment buildings and sent smoke rising above the skyline. Cars, some with the “Z” symbol of the Russian invasion force in their windows, drove past stacks of ammunition boxes and artillery shells in a neighborhood controlled by Russian-backed separatists.

In Kharkiv, doctors are struggling to treat COVID-19 patients as the bombs fall outside. Several times a day, air raid sirens wail at a local hospital, sending virus patients - some connected to ventilators and struggling to breathe - into bomb shelters.

HOW IS THE WORLD RESPONDING TO THE WAR?

Film icon Arnold Schwarzenegger told Russians in a video posted on social media Thursday they're being lied to about the war in Ukraine. He also accused Putin of sacrificing Russian soldiers' lives for his own ambitions.

Schwarzenegger posted his video on Twitter, YouTube and Instagram. While some of those services are blocked in Russia, he also posted it on the Telegram messaging app - which is not - where it got more than a half-million views. It was subtitled in Russian.

U.S. President Joe Biden and China's Xi Jinping are scheduled to speak by phone on Friday. Biden also plans to travel to Europe next week for talks with European leaders about the Russian invasion, and will attend an extraordinary NATO summit in Brussels. NATO has been bolstering its eastern flank with troops and equipment to deter Russia from invading any of its members.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said American officials are evaluating and documenting potential war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine. Blinken said the intentional targeting of civilians is a war crime, for which there will be “massive consequences.”

Petro Andrushenko wrote on social media:

“So far, there is no exact operational data on how many people were hiding in the shelter or the number of casualties. I expect we will have it later today. But the situation is difficult and there is nowhere to get the data from.”

An earlier estimate from the city council put the number sheltering in the school building at 400.

The information black hole reflects a similar lack of clarity about how many people survived an attack five days ago on a theatre in Mariupol that was also being used as a shelter, possibly for up to 1,300 people.

The number of people reported having survived – put at 130 - has been unchanged for several days.

Fighting continued Sunday for control of the port city in southeastern Ukraine that has become a focus of Russia’s assault on the country.

“The city continues to be shelled both from the sky and the sea,” Andrushenko wrote on his Telegram channel.

“It seems the occupiers are so eager to wipe out Mariupol that they are ready to cover themselves with fire.”

He also said people trying to flee the city in their cars were being shot at by Russian forces.

“Evacuation is difficult - difficult but moving. The Russians are doing everything to complicate things. Last night, cars trying to drive towards the village of Melekine [10 kilometers west of the city center] were fired upon.”

Other residents looking to flee were having their cars seized from them at a checkpoint just outside Mariupol, he said.

Despite the dangers, Ukraine’s government announced the humanitarian corridor linking Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia, outside Russian-occupied territory, had been agreed for Sunday.

A council official reported that a column of eleven buses carrying almost 800 people had completed the second part of the journey, from Berdiansk to Zaporozhzhia, by midday Sunday.",https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-20-22/h_9711ec16279cb469d2f53bda9049f04f

The Pentagon has recorded a record set by the Armed Forces in the use of Javelin anti-tank systems: out of 112 launches, 100 accurate hits!

The Ukrainian military destroyed the Russian Tiger with a high-ranking official and an armored personnel carrier with a landing party, according to the Special Operations Forces command.

""There are two finals,"" Kuleba said of the end of the war in Ukraine. ""There is no need to make any drama, but we must all remember that in any war there are two finals. The first final is an unconditional total defeat of one of the parties. This is what the Russians wanted to impose on us from the very beginning, The second final is an agreement. The agreement is a search and fixation of mutually acceptable solutions,"" said the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine.

After talks with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, President Zelenskyy said that the European Commission's opinion on Ukraine's application for EU membership would be ready in a few months.

The NBU reports: UAH 26 million remains on the special account to help the army; further assistance is needed. In total, the National Bank has already collected and transferred almost UAH 12.2 billion to defense needs.

You can help with these account details. Let's join! Together we are a force!

Humanitarian corridors

Reintegration Minister Vereshchuk announced the humanitarian corridors to open on March 18:

from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia. A convoy of buses with a fuel truck continued to move from the village of Vasylivka,

from Sumy, Trostianets, Lebedyn, Konotop, Krasnopillia, Velyka Pysarivka to Poltava,

humanitarian cargo is planned to Balaklia and Izium in the Kharkiv region. Also, the delivery of aid to the cities of the Kherson and Luhansk regions is planned for tomorrow.

""Because of the shelling, the corridor for humanitarian aid from the city of Kharkiv to the city of Vovchansk did not work. We continue to work on coordinating routes for the delivery of humanitarian aid to all besieged and blocked cities,"" Vereshchuk added.

You can clarify the information about the humanitarian corridors or people who are in the disaster zone without communication at the numbers of the National Information Bureau, which was opened yesterday: 📞 16-48; 044-287-81-65.

Izium. ""Green corridor"" is again nonexistent due to shelling, according to the head of the City Council Maksym Strelnyk. Nevertheless, the authorities, with the territorial defense, deliver humanitarian aid to the villages of the Izium district and evacuate people from there.

14:00 – an evacuation convoy of buses from Zaporizhzhia arrived in Berdiansk. There was also a fuel truck with fuel for private cars, on which Mariupol residents are being evacuated. After refueling, private cars will leave for Zaporizhzhia in a convoy.

According to Reintegration Minister Vereshchuk, on March 19 they will work on delivering aid to Kherson, Kharkiv, and Luhansk regions, as well as organizing the evacuation of people from the Kyiv region.

Ukraine's talks with Russia

Zelenskyy is ready to meet with Putin ""even tomorrow,"" said Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. The Minister also explained in detail that the current meetings of the delegations of Ukraine and Russia had a number of issues that the negotiators cannot resolve on their own.

The United States is also not very optimistic: Blinken admitted that the states do not see any signs that Putin is ready to stop. At the moment, Russia and its leader, Vladimir Putin, show no signs of participating in responsible talks and ending Russia's bloody aggression against Ukraine.

Who's coming to Ukraine?

About financial aid, weapons, and volunteer fighters

The supply of US weapons to Ukraine lasts once a day or once every two days, and additional military aid will be transferred just as quickly, Psaki said.

The G7 foreign ministers agreed to increase humanitarian aid to Ukraine and called on other states to do so.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg also promised to continue supplying NATO weapons to Ukraine.

The World Bank will allocate $100,000,000 to Ukraine to pay scholarships to university students.

Not only money but also people. Thus, a Belarusian volunteer battalion is going to Ukraine to help the Armed Forces. The fighters will help break through the blockade of Mariupol.

American director and producer Steven Spielberg and his wife, actress Kate Capshaw, donated $1 million to humanitarian aid to Ukraine. They allocated money to several organizations, Variety writes.

Trains with humanitarian cargo weighing 30 tons arrived in Vinnytsia and Mykolaiv. According to the Commander of the Joint Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Lieutenant-General Serhiy Naiev, the humanitarian cargo consists of wheelchairs, medicines, baby food, and long-term lasting food. The cargo was transferred with the help of the International Association for the Support of Ukraine Charitable Foundation. Aid comes from Italy, Germany, Poland, Greece, Lithuania, and the United States.

13:00 – Ukraine received another 300 million euros of macro-financial assistance from the EU.

16:30 – Ambassador of Ukraine to the United States Oksana Markarova said that part of the assistance provided by the United States to Ukraine has already crossed the border. Markarova assured that it was not the last help Ukraine expects from the United States.

Professional tennis player from Switzerland Roger Federer has decided to donate $500,000 to help children affected by the war in Ukraine.

Israel has sent armored ambulances to Ukraine.

Infrastructure

During the week of the war, Russia's damage to Ukraine's infrastructure grew by at least $8.3 billion. As of March 17, that amount was 1.8 trillion hryvnias or $62.6 billion, according to an analysis by the Kyiv School of Economics.

From March 18, fuel prices will be reduced in Ukraine: the cost of diesel per liter will be five hryvnias less, gasoline will be cheaper more than seven hryvnias.

The President of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine Zahorodnii addressed the leadership of the International Association of Academies of Sciences: ""The fire of Russian aircraft and artillery erases peaceful cities from the face of the earth, destroys civilian infrastructure: kindergartens, schools, hospitals, residential buildings. The bombing killed civilians and innocent children. Objects of scientific infrastructure, in particular the institutes of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Sumy, and other cities of Ukraine, were also affected by the Russian shelling,"" the document reads.

It should be noted that the International Association of Academies of Sciences has not reacted in any way to the tragic events in Ukraine since the beginning of the Russian military invasion.

Gazprom is using Ukrainian gas pipelines at full capacity, according to the Ukrainian gas transportation system. Through Ukraine, the company sends more than 105 million cubic meters of gas per day.

For comparison, in January Gazprom reduced the daily volume of gas transit through Ukraine to Europe to about 50 million cubic meters. This is the lowest figure since January 2020. This has led to a jump in energy prices.

Peaceful atom

Ukraine expects more decisive action from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on Russians seizing nuclear facilities in Ukraine. This was stated by Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko on the air of the Priamyi TV channel.

""We would like clearer signals, clearer actions. In the context of what we expect: first, all troops must leave nuclear facilities. Second, a demilitarized zone must be formed around those facilities, in which no one has a right to come in. Third, workers must work in decent conditions,"" Halushchenko said.

News from abroad

US President Joe Biden will discuss Russia's war against Ukraine with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, according to The Wall Street Journal. The US president will call Xi Jinping on March 18.

Yesterday, the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic Petr Fiala said that the Czech Republic can no longer accept refugees from Ukraine: the country has already accepted about 270 thousand Ukrainians. So there was still some free space for the night: the Prague authorities want to give part of the Russian embassy to Ukrainian refugees. This was reported by Czech Television.

Norway is taking the baton. They are ready to shelter about 30,000 Ukrainian refugees this year but are preparing for a situation in which up to 100,000 people may arrive.

Meanwhile, Poland's prime minister has announced the creation of an anti-Putin shield and the ""de-Russification"" of the country's economy.

А Болгарія оголосила 10 російських дипломатів персонами нон грата. Їм надали 72 години для виїзду з країни.

Латвія, Литва та Естонія теж висилають російських дипломатів. Їх звинувачують у підриві нацбезпеки та поширенні пропаганди.

And Bulgaria has declared 10 Russian diplomats persona non grata. They were given 72 hours to leave the country.

Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia are also sending Russian diplomats out. They are accused of undermining national security and spreading propaganda.

16:15 – In a video meeting, Chinese leader Xi Jinping told Biden that the United States and China should not only develop bilateral relations but also assume international responsibility.

Russian lies don't get tired

Employees of the Center for Combating Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine collected a selection of fresh fakes, manipulations, and disinformation ""throws"" that the enemy produced during March 17, 2022:

The head of the radiation, chemical, and biological protection forces of the Russian Armed Forces held a briefing on US bio laboratories in Ukraine that infected birds with viruses and studied the ways of their migration to the territory of the Russian Armed Forces. Fake!

The network of photos and videos of rescued orphans is accompanied by a call to ""adopt them quickly"" and the readiness of the Ukrainian authorities to hand them over to ""good hands"". Fake! Ukraine doesn't ""distribute"" orphans . If any assistance is required, this will be officially announced. At present, Ukraine has a simplified procedure, but not adoption, but guardianship or patronage.

Information is spreading on the Internet that the Ukrainian authorities have left Mariupol. Fake! ""Mariupol is a topic №1 for the President and diplomacy.""

The occupiers shot a video allegedly distributing humanitarian aid in Lyptsi, Kharkiv region. ""Pure montage and editing,"" the head of the Kharkiv regional state administration, Sinehubov, reacted to a fake. ""We see provocations when Russian TV channels filmed in Lyptsi, the fact of humanitarian aid distribution, the gym was filmed. There is no such gym in this settlement. This is pure editing with actors who are brought there specifically for comments and a certain picture.""

More great and various sanctions!

In the Netherlands, sanctions have frozen Russian assets by more than 200 million euros, according to Reuters.

Australia has imposed sanctions on 11 Russian banks and government agencies. New Zealand is also imposing sanctions on Russia. The state will freeze the assets of Putin and 12 members of the Security Council.

Japan is also imposing new sanctions on individuals and companies from Russia.

Apple will not sell the new iPhone SE and other devices from the spring presentation in Russia.

Bank of New York Mellon, one of the oldest US banks, has suspended investments in Russian securities and donated $1 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine

According to Kuleba, the European Union is discussing the preparation of the fifth package of sanctions against Russia for its war against Ukraine.

14:00 – Russian and Belarusian diplomats were banned from entering the buildings of the European Parliament, said Parliament Speaker Roberta Metsola. The occupier and his henchmen are now worse than lepers.

Paramount has ceased operations in Russia. The film company will also donate one million dollars to humanitarian aid to Ukraine.

Lithuania has restricted the export of cash euros to Belarus and Russia. Now, individuals traveling to Belarus or Russia from Lithuania can carry no more than €60 per person.

Korean LG has announced the cessation of all supplies to Russia

To date, 220 companies have left the Russian market, and every day there are more and more of them, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine.

The United States can lift many sanctions against Russia only if the Kremlin ends its war against Ukraine and restores its sovereignty, the State Department said.

Norway has joined several new EU sanctions against Russia. These include personal sanctions, as well as restrictions on the export of technology, goods, and services. Norwegian Foreign Minister Anniken Hewitfeld called the sanctions package the broadest the country has ever adopted.

What's in Russia?

The rating agency S&P downgraded Russia's rating to CC from CCC, as the owners of Russian bonds never received a payment. Russia is separated from the default rating by one step. According to the agency's scale, the CC rating means high vulnerability: the default has not yet occurred but is virtually certain.

The media write that in Russia they cannot print ""rubles"" because the paint and paper were supplied by Canada and Switzerland.

Manufacturers of hygiene products were more cautious. The Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation assures the Russians that pads and diapers will be enough for Russia for as long as 3 months: ""Manufacturers have bought enough raw materials to avoid shortages,"" the ministry said. As you know, now due to the upheaval, these products have disappeared from store shelves in Russia, and hygiene products have risen in price by 40%.

The Russians hope in vain that in three months all sanctions will be lifted.

Mordor threatens Georgia: ""If Georgia refuses to give Russian inspectors access to US Biolabs on its territory, Russia has every right to launch a missile strike on them,"" said Mikhail Aleksandrov, a leading expert at the MGIMO's Center for Military and Political Studies.

In Russia, the demand for antidepressants has quadrupled. From February 28 to March 6, their sales in pharmacies exceeded 525 million rubles, which is more than four times more than a year ago.

This is not surprising, because Russia has already suffered huge losses on all fronts. Ukrainian defenders destroy Russian soldiers. And the sanctions of European countries destroy the remnants of Russia's hopes for a good or at least normal life. The default has technically already taken place. We explain what this means.

""Any cargo that enters the territory of Ukraine, which we consider to be carrying weapons, will become a legitimate target,"" said Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. This is definitely a direct threat to Ukraine's western partners.

Kuleba's immediate reaction was not long in coming: Ukraine's foreign minister said Moscow would not decide what military assistance Ukraine could receive to resist the Russian invasion.

""Russia has never had any claims against the people of Ukraine,"" Lavrov said. Translated into human language: we kill you just because we like it.

Life considering hostilities

The validity of electronic signatures during martial law has been extended.

This was reported on the Facebook page of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. ""Qualified Electronic Signature (QES) will be reissued automatically based on previously created keys. Therefore, it will be possible to continue signing documents online,"" the message reads.

The National Bank of Ukraine has recorded the sending of electronic fraudulent letters, allegedly on behalf of the NBU, Ukrainians are asked to transfer funds to help the Armed Forces in cryptocurrency. The following two fake addresses have been recorded:

However, southern Ukrainian birds are not subject to any order of Russian invaders. In the area of ​​Kalanchak in the Kherson region, geese joined the air defense of Ukraine. Another enemy fighter crashed here. According to eyewitnesses, this time the occupier's military plane was ""shot down"" by a flock of wild geese. One or more birds heroically got into the engine of a Russian fighter, as a result of which it fell into the swamp. We feel sorry or geese, but even nature is on the side of our country!

Ukraine's talks with Russia

Negotiations between Ukraine and Russia may last several weeks, despite some changes in the negotiation process, said the adviser to the head of the Ukrainian president's office Mykhailo Podoliak in an interview with Bloomberg TV. He also noted that ""there are signs that Moscow's position has become more adequate.""

""Russia is using the peace talks with Ukraine as a 'smokescreen' to prepare for new 'horrific atrocities' and war crimes,"" said British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss. I mean, if the country is serious about negotiations, it will not indiscriminately bomb civilians on this day,"" said Truss.

Atomic objects

Ukrenergo restored the high-voltage line of the Zaporizhzhia NPP – the Kakhovka substation, which was damaged by the Russian fascists. The line again ensures the stable operation of the Zaporizhzhia NPP.

The situation at the Chornobyl nuclear power plant is not controlled by the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate. The shift staff is hostages. Russia made the exclusion zone a springboard for the offensive.

Who's coming to Ukraine?

About financial aid, weapons, and volunteer fighters

Former British Prime Minister David Cameron is delivering humanitarian aid to Poland, collected for Ukrainians who have temporarily moved to the country.

The issue with the Slovak S-300 has been resolved.

At the request of NATO, Ukraine will receive the S-300 air defense system from Slovakia. Instead, Slovakia will receive American Patriot anti-aircraft missile systems from the Netherlands and Germany.

The UN delivered the first convoy of emergency humanitarian aid to Sumy. It is about 130 tons of humanitarian aid, including medicine, water, and food.

NATO has agreed on a mechanism for supplying air defense systems to Ukraine.

And German Development Minister Svenja Schulze announced the sending of heavy firefighting equipment and civil protection equipment to Ukraine.

400 rifles will be handed over to Ukraine by the American company KelTec. This is the first batch to be delivered to our country under NATO leadership.

Assistance to refugees and those who receive them

Scotland and Wales are ready to receive 4,000 refugees from Ukraine under the Homes for Ukraine program. This is stated in a joint statement by the governments of Scotland and Wales. The Homes for Ukraine program provides that refugees can agree on accommodation with individuals or legal entities, but the United Kingdom doesn't participate in the process.

The government plans to at least reimburse Ukrainian families who have accommodated IDPs for at least the cost of utilities.

According to the latest estimates of the UN Migration Agency, about 6.5 million Ukrainians have become internally displaced and 3.2 million have gone abroad due to the Russian war. This is almost a quarter of the population of Ukraine.

News from abroad

UNESCO supports Ukraine in preserving its cultural heritage and urges Russia to refrain from destroying and seizing its values. The relevant declaration on the protection of Ukraine's cultural heritage was adopted at the second extraordinary meeting of the UNESCO Committee for the Protection of Cultural Heritage in the event of an armed conflict on 18 March.

And this is a rally in Switzerland against the decision of the food giant Nestlé to stay on the Russian market. Thank you, friends! Your protest is proof that money that smells bad cannot be disguised with even the most delicious chocolate.

What's in Russia?

In Russian Bryansk, in one of the temples, people saw icons with the instructions: ""Russian soldier, your task is to wipe the Ukrainian nation from the face of the earth."" This is their ""Orthodox faith."" And in fact, it's ordinary fascism.

The Kadyrovites returned to Chechnya. During their stay in Ukraine, Chechen groups lost hundreds of troops and returned to Grozny on March 13, the SBU counterintelligence said.

Another high-ranking occupier also changed his location. He did not go home, but immediately to hell. Ukrainian fighters eliminated another Russian commander, Deputy Commander of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation, Captain First Rank Andrey Paliy.

Meanwhile, the Finnish border shuttle business has resumed in Russia.

People from Finnish border towns again began to receive parcels and documents at their addresses by car or by minibus to take them to Vyborg, Leningrad Oblast, St. Petersburg, along with orders for medicines, household chemicals, coffee, and more. Gasoline, cigarettes, and all kinds of chemical fertilizers are brought back.

What can we hear from Belarus?

Dead and wounded servicemen of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and the Russian National Guard continue to be transported to Belarus from the territory of Ukraine. In the city of Gomel, all medical institutions with surgical departments are involved in the reception and treatment of wounded occupiers. A high death rate is recorded among the severely wounded Russian invaders.

Russian lies

Warning! In the photo above, there's another lie from the Russian fascists. Propagandists are spreading a fake map of the occupation of the occupiers on the territory of Ukraine. In the fictional picture, the Kremlin media described almost half of our country's area as occupied or blocked by Russian assassins. In fact, the occupiers continue to suffer significant losses and are stopped in many areas, according to the latest data from the General Staff of the Armed Forces.

Russia's Defense Ministry has said that the SBU has mined a city hospital in Dnipro and plans to blow up the building when a Russian plane is over the city. This is also, of course, a brazen lie. However, it may indicate what target the Russian freaks have chosen for the next bombing.

And the Center for Counteracting Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine reminds of simple and effective rules of information hygiene:

Lavrov accused Poland of wanting to seize Western Ukraine, Polish media write.

Sanctions on the aggressor!

Halliburton, one of the world's largest oil and gas service companies, is shutting down and halting business in Russia.

The United States has banned the maintenance of 100 liners used by Russia. The list includes the Aeroflot fleet and Roman Abramovich's planes. The press release says that the ban on aircraft maintenance, in particular abroad, provides for the actual cessation of international flights from Russia on these aircraft.

Life considering hostilities

The Cabinet of Ministers has decided to simplify all customs procedures during martial law, said Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal:

""No papers at customs. Excluding VAT, duties, and customs duties. On a declarative basis.""

Important! Russian intelligence takes 90% of information from Ukrainians from social media. Therefore, it is strictly forbidden to exhibit data/photos/videos about airstrikes, addresses of objects, and in general anything that the enemy can use against us.

Kyiv

Satellite imagery shows that the Russian occupiers are trying to dig in under Borodianka and Hostomel. Additional military equipment with earthen fortifications was also observed in Borodianka and Zdvyzhivka. It is unlikely that this will help the orcs not find themselves in the same land that they are now flipping through so carefully.

The man came out of the Irpin hell on foot and took two cows with him, he reached the town of Korostyshiv on his own. On the way, he was picked up by a truck and he reached a safe place, which was found by volunteers.

Heavy smog is observed in Kyiv and Kyiv region in the morning. However, the SES notes that there is no reason to panic. As of 7:00 am, no fires have been recorded in the Kyiv region in ecosystems, in particular in the Exclusion Zone and near the Chornobyl NPP. Adviser to the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Denysenko wrote that the smoke over Kyiv appeared due to the burning of a landfill near Novy Petrivtsi, also due to windless weather.

Donetsk and Luhansk regions

Mariupol's Azovstal metallurgical plant was completely destroyed as a result of airstrikes by the aggressor country. The Mariupol City Hall says that it can no longer be launched.

In the area of ​​Rubizhne, the enemy established itself on the western and north-western outskirts of the city, making unsuccessful attempts to reach the southern part of the city. Fighting continues for the city of Popasna

In the Donetsk direction, the occupying forces are fighting in the settlements of Verkhnotoretske, Krymske, Avdiivka, and Taramchuk. The blockade and attempts to storm the hero city of Mariupol continue.

21:00 – The occupiers forcibly force the residents of Mariupol to go to Russia, where people end up in filtration camps. People are taken from the Left Bank district of the city and taken first to filtration camps, and then some are sent to remote Russian cities, said the Mariupol City Council. The occupiers have forcibly deported several thousand Mariupol residents to Russia.

Kherson region

Kherson region suffers from the hostile occupation in all directions. In the region more than 70 settlements remain without electricity supply; it is almost 50 thousand citizens. The same number of users have not had water for a long time.

Mykolaiv and region

Yesterday, on March 18, Mykolaiv was bombed by occupiers. Some Western journalists report that at least 40 Ukrainians were killed in a Russian attack in Mykolaiv. According to preliminary information, these are the military. The mayor of Mykolaiv Oleksandr Senkevich confirmed that in the morning of March 18 occupiers attacked Mykolaiv. It is known that the blow was inflicted on the barracks. Senkevych does not disclose more details. There is still no official information on the number of dead and injured.

The column of occupiers in the Mykolaiv region is destroyed!

The Head of the Regional Military Administration Vitalii Kim addressed residents of the region with a request to collect bodies of dead occupiers in bags. ""It's a myth is that they will turn into fertilizers and the seeds should be covered. No, it will be a long time and the corpse poison will interfere with our own sowing. Dogs don't eat much, and so do wolves,"" said Kim.

Zhytomyr region

On March 18, Russian troops shelled the village of Budo-Vorobii in the Korosten district. This was reported in the Telegram by the Department of SES in the Zhytomyr region. The shelling damaged a private house and an outbuilding. One unit of equipment and six rescuers were involved in extinguishing the fire and conducting search and rescue operations. No one was killed or injured.

Chernihiv and region

In Chernihiv, 11 people were injured in the shelling of two dormitories by Russian troops on March 18. This was reported by the main department of the SES in the region. In total, for the past 24hrs, they have recorded 11 fires, 4 of them in the residential sector. Rescuers of the pyrotechnic service went to the places where they found and took out 3 explosive devices three times. In total, since the beginning of hostilities, rescuers have eliminated 284 fires, of which: 215 due to shelling and 70 for other reasons. 40 people were rescued, including 10 children. 50 people died.

Crimea and ORDLO

According to the General Staff of Ukraine, in occupied Crimea, some units of the enemy's marines lost up to 90% of their personnel, and there are no reserves to recover the losses. There are attempts to recruit companies to be sent to Ukraine at the expense of those sent from other military units. Repression is used against ""deniers.""

Refrigerators with 200 cargo arrive at the Luhansk Regional Hospital every day. These are the bodies of soldiers of the 2nd Army Corps. Queues of relatives of the dead lined up near the district executive committees on death certificates.

And we need to keep calm and faith in the Armed Forces of Ukraine! Ukraine will win! Death to enemies!",https://rubryka.com/en/article/24-den-vijny/

Serhii Borzov, head of the Vinnytsia regional military administration exclaimed after the shooting, “We are closing the sky with our own forces,” he said referring to the Ukrainian government’s plea to NATO to close the skies over Ukraine which has been denied so far. Three enemy cruise missiles were shot down over the Vinnytsia region according to Borzov. Two more Russian missiles were brought down over the city of Lviv said Serhii Bratchuk, the spokesman of the Odesa Regional Military Administration, as quoted in the Ukrainian military’s Facebook and Telegram channels. Russian military have launched six cruise missiles, presumably Kh-555, from the Black Sea area on the city of Lviv. Two of them were downed by Ukrainian anti-aircraft defense systems, said Bratchuk.

Lviv Aircraft Repair Plant Destroyed in missile strike

However, four Russian cruise missiles struck the Lviv Aircraft Repair Plant, destroying its buildings, according Lviv Mayor Andrii Sadovyi on Telegram. The plant specializes in the repair and overhaul of MiG-29 fighter aircraft.

The Kh-555 is an air-launched cruise missile with a highly acurate guidance system. The missile has reduced radar cross-section but is not completely invisible to radar. It can be launched at altitudes ranging from 60 to 10,000 meters. The Kh-555 missile can carry a 400 kg conventional warhead up to a distance of 3,500 km, according to information from Russian open sources.",https://www.defenseworld.net/2022/03/18/ukrainian-forces-shoot-down-russian-cruise-missiles-for-first-time.html

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Rescue workers searched for survivors Thursday in the ruins of a theater blown apart by a Russian airstrike in the besieged city of Mariupol, while scores of Ukrainians across the country were killed in ferocious urban attacks on a school, a hostel and other sites.

Hundreds of civilians had been taking shelter in the grand, columned theater in central Mariupol after their homes were destroyed in three weeks of fighting in the southern port city of 430,000.

More than a day after the airstrike, there were no reports of deaths. With communications disrupted across the city and movement difficult because of shelling and other fighting, there were conflicting reports on whether anyone had emerged from the rubble.

“We hope and we think that some people who stayed in the shelter under the theater could survive,"" Petro Andrushchenko, an official with the mayor’s office, told The Associated Press. He said the building had a relatively modern basement bomb shelter designed to withstand airstrikes. Video and photos provided by the Ukrainian military showed that the at least three-story building had been reduced to a roofless shell, with some exterior walls collapsed.

Other officials had said earlier that some people had gotten out. Ukraine’s ombudswoman, Ludmyla Denisova, said on the Telegram messaging app that the shelter had held up.

Satellite imagery on Monday from Maxar Technologies showed huge white letters on the pavement in front of and behind the theater spelling out “CHILDREN” in Russian — “DETI” — to alert warplanes to those inside.

Across the city, snow flurries fell around the skeletons of burned, windowless and shrapnel-scarred apartment buildings as smoke rose above the skyline.

“We are trying to survive somehow,” said one Mariupol resident, who gave only her first name, Elena. “My child is hungry. I don’t know what to give him to eat.”

She had been trying to call her mother, who was in a town 50 miles (80 kilometers) away. “I can’t tell her I am alive, you understand. There is no connection, just nothing,"" she said.

Cars, some with the “Z” symbol of the Russian invasion force in their windows, drove past stacks of ammunition boxes and artillery shells in a neighborhood controlled by Russian-backed separatists.

Russia's military denied bombing the theater or anyplace else in Mariupol on Wednesday.

The strike against the theater was part of a furious bombardment of civilian sites in multiple cities over the past few days.

In the northern city of Chernihiv, at least 53 people had been brought to morgues over the past 24 hours, killed amid heavy Russian air attacks and ground fire, the local governor, Viacheslav Chaus, told Ukrainian TV on Thursday.

Ukraine's emergency services said a mother, father and three of their children, including 3-year-old twins, were killed when a Chernihiv hostel was shelled. Civilians were hiding in basements and shelters across the embattled city of 280,000.

“The city has never known such nightmarish, colossal losses and destruction,” Chaus said.

Ukrainian officials said 10 people were killed Wednesday while waiting in a bread line in Chernihiv. An American man was among them, his sister said on Facebook.

At least 21 people were killed when Russian artillery destroyed a school and a community center before dawn in Merefa, near the northeast city of Kharkiv, according to Mayor Veniamin Sitov. The region has seen heavy bombardment in a bid by stalled Russian forces to advance.

In eastern Ukraine, a municipal pool complex where pregnant women and women with children were taking shelter was also hit Wednesday, according to Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the Donetsk regional administration. There was no word on casualties in that strike.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for more help for his country in a video address to German lawmakers, saying thousands of people have been killed, including 108 children. He also referred to the dire situation in Mariupol, saying: “Everything is a target for them.”

The address began with a delay because of a technical problem caused by an attack close to where Zelenskyy was speaking, Bundestag deputy speaker Katrin Goering-Eckardt said.

Zelenskyy’s office said Russian airstrikes hit the Kalynivka and Brovary suburbs of the capital, Kyiv. Emergency authorities in Kyiv said a fire broke out in a 16-story apartment building hit by remnants of a downed Russian rocket, and one person was killed.

Zelenskyy said he was thankful to U.S. President Joe Biden for additional military aid, but he would not get into specifics about the new package, saying he did not want Russia to know what to expect. He said when the invasion began on Feb. 24, Russia expected to find Ukraine much as it did in 2014, when Russia seized Crimea without a fight and backed separatists as they took control of the eastern Donbas region.

Instead, he said, Ukraine had much stronger defenses than expected, and Russia ""didn’t know what we had for defense or how we prepared to meet the blow.”

At a Thursday meeting of the U.N. Security Council, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the WHO has verified 43 attacks on hospitals and health facilities, with 12 people killed and 34 injured. Tedros said disruption to hospital services now poses an extreme risk to people with serious illnesses and “the lifesaving medicine we need right now is peace.”

In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of the Group of Seven leading economies accused Putin of conducting an “unprovoked and shameful war,” and called on Russia to comply with the International Court of Justice’s order to stop its attack and withdraw its forces.

Russian law enforcement, meanwhile, announced the first known criminal cases under a new law that allows for 15-year prison terms for posting what is deemed to be “false information” about the war. Among those charged was Veronika Belotserkovskaya, a Russian-language cookbook author and blogger living abroad.

One day after Biden called Russian President Vladimir Putin a “war criminal,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said American officials were evaluating and documenting potential war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine. Blinken said the intentional targeting of civilians would amount to a war crime and that there will be “massive consequences” for any such crimes that are confirmed.

Both Ukraine and Russia this week reported some progress in negotiations. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that some negotiators were breaking into working groups, “but there should be contacts today.""

Zelenskyy said he would not reveal Ukraine's negotiating tactics.

“Working more in silence than on television, radio or on Facebook,” Zelenskyy said. “I consider it the right way.”

While details of Thursday's talks were unknown, an official in Zelenskyy’s office told the AP that on Wednesday, the main subject discussed was whether Russian troops would remain in separatist regions in eastern Ukraine after the war and where the borders would be.

The official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive talks, said Ukraine was insisting on the inclusion of one or more Western nuclear powers in the negotiations and on legally binding security guarantees for Ukraine.

In exchange, the official said, Ukraine was ready to discuss a neutral military status.

Russia has demanded that NATO pledge never to admit Ukraine to the alliance or station forces there.

The fighting has led more than 3 million people to flee Ukraine, the U.N. estimates. The death toll remains unknown, though Ukraine has said thousands of civilians have died.
