The Pentagon says it has invested $200 million in Ukraine since 2005 through its Biological Threat Reduction Program – an offshoot of the Nunn-Lugar program enacted after the end of the Cold War - and now works on research projects based on birds carrying viruses and the spread of swine flu.

The program has 'improved Ukraine's biological safety, security and surveillance for both human and animal health,' according to the Pentagon, including by reducing the risk of the Soviet Union's biological weapons program.

The relationship began as part of a U.S. effort to lock down unsecured biological materials after the fall of the Soviet Union, working directly with Russia and former republics. There is little known about the location of the labs, but reports in the past have suggested they have been equipped to work with deadly pathogens such as anthrax.

But Russia has used the information to accuse the U.S. and Ukraine of planning to use biological weapons – something the Biden Administration could be a signal of a planned 'false flag' operation.

China have also jumped on the claims and tweeted on March 8: 'The US has 336 labs in 30 countries under its control, including 26 in Ukraine alone. It should give a full account of its biological military activities at home and abroad and subject itself to multilateral verification.'

But the U.S. has been open about the labs and on March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that they too had advised Ukraine to destroy high-threat pathogens housed in the country's public health laboratories to prevent 'any potential spills' that would spread disease among the population.

How US biolabs in Ukraine have sparked conspiracy theories for decades - and how these claims accelerated after Putin's invasion of Ukraine

Conspiracy theories about the 'biolabs' date back years – with the latest iteration surfacing just 10 days before Russia's invasion, according the threat intelligence company Pyrra Technologies. Postings proliferated on the day of the invasion.

The Defense Department said in a fact sheet on March 11 that since 2005, it has spent $200 million in Ukraine supporting 46 Ukrainian laboratories, health facilities and diagnostic sites.

It works with Ukrainian health and agriculture ministries and agencies. Those organizations have limited contact with Ukraine's military, providing mobile diagnostic labs in case of a public health emergency, according to the U.S. government.

'These are all public health and veterinary labs,' said Gregory Koblentz, director of the Biodefense Graduate Program at George Mason University, according to Poynter. 'None of them have been involved in biological warfare'.

The Pentagon, in its fact sheet, says it 'has worked cooperatively and peacefully with the government of Ukraine to increase biosecurity and biosafety at these sites to ensure pathogens do not pose a risk to the people of Ukraine or the region,' and says research has gone into topics like 'preparing for and controlling African Swine Fever.'

Postings about the 'biolabs' appeared online just before Russia's invasion of Ukraine and proliferated afterward, as Russia sought to justify an invasion it also claimed was required to 'deNazify' the country

Russia already illegally took possession of two such labs in 2014 and 'continues to deny Ukrainian access to these facilities,' according to the Defense Department.

'After Russia launched its unlawful invasion of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Ministry of Health responsibly ordered the safe and secure disposal of samples,' according to the fact sheet. 'These actions limit the danger of an accidental release of pathogens should Russia's military attack laboratories, a real concern since they have attacked Ukraine's nuclear power plants and research facilities.'

A U.S. National Academy of Sciences report in 2012 stated that the Ukrainian facilities had been upgraded to work with some of the most dangerous substances in the world, including anthrax, which prompted the renewed fears of a spill.

Congress asks top State Department and National Intelligence officials about the labs and whether they have biological weapons

State Department official Victoria Nuland testified last week that 'Ukraine has biological research facilities which, in fact, we are now quite concerned Russian troops, Russian forces, may be seeking to gain control of.'

State Department official Victoria Nuland testified last week that 'Ukraine has biological research facilities which, in fact, we are now quite concerned Russian troops, Russian forces, may be seeking to gain control of'

'So we are working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces should they approach,' she said under questioning by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (R).

She referred to Russia's latest charges as the 'classic Russian technique to blame the other guy what they're planning to do themselves.'

The Director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines, told the Senate Intelligence Committee that Ukraine 'operates a little over a dozen' biolabs for biodefence and public health response. She said the US has, at least in the past, 'provided assistance' to the labs 'in the context of biosafety'.

'Which is something we have done with a variety of different countries,' she added.

She said the labs were not being used to develop weapons.

'We do not assess that Ukraine is pursuing either biological weapons or nuclear weapons. This influence campaign is consistent with long-standing Russian efforts to accuse the United States of sponsoring bioweapons. ... This is a classic move by the Russians.'

The website of the US Embassy in Ukraine says: 'The US Department of Defence's Biological Threat Reduction Programme collaborates with partner countries to counter the threat of outbreaks (deliberate, accidental, or natural) of the world's most dangerous infectious diseases.

Former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard starts asking questions about the labs

Former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard faced heavy pushback and was accused of pushing Kremlin propaganda when she posted comments about 'biolabs' in Ukraine – and claimed there was a risk of dangerous pathogens escaping from the war zone.

After getting in an angry spat with Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Gabbard sought to 'clarify' her remarks on Tuesday, and noted that in her latest comments she did not refer to biological weapons.

'I'm not convinced there are biological weapons labs or biological weapons in Ukraine — that's not what I'm concerned about. I'm concerned about the existence of the 25+ biological labs in that war zone,' she said.

Then she spelled out differences between 'biolabs' and 'bio weapons' – although the Russians have not always made such distinctions in their online attacks, some of which appear designed to serve as a justification for the invasion of Ukraine.

The Pentagon says it has invested $200 million in Ukraine since 2005 through its Biological Threat Reduction Program – an offshoot of the Nunn-Lugar program enacted after the end of the Cold War

Tucker Carlson referred to a report authored by a Department of Defense director in February, warning that US-funded research in Ukrainian biolabs could be exploited by Russian invaders looking to develop a chemical weapon

'Biolabs', 'bioweapons labs', and 'bioweapons' are 3 very different things. But because these phrases are so similar, there is sometimes miscommunication and misunderstanding when discussing them,' she tweeted. 'I recently experienced this myself. So let me clarify,' she began.

She went on to write that biolabs 'are facilities which contain and experiment with dangerous pathogens, ostensibly for the purpose of serving the public good (i.e. vaccines, etc.),' as distinct from biological weapons.

But that distinction sometimes gets lost.

'The 'biolabs' are serving as a false justification for why Russia invaded Ukraine. It's defensive,' Clint Watts, a senior fellow at the Center for Cyber and Homeland Security at George Washington University, told NBC. 'They create a situation where they go to a populist audience, push out talking points, get the audience primed and make it true later.'

Gabbard gained a platform following her 2020 presidential campaign. She did not seek reelection to her House seat that year.

She has since been promoted to a Lt. Col. in the Army National Guard. She now serves as a civil affairs officer in Special Forces Command, which oversees the Green Berets.

'Tulsi Gabbard's comments made in her civilian capacity represent her views and not those of 1st Special Forces Command,' unit spokesman Maj. Dan Lessard, said, Military.com reported.

She also posted a video in December 2021 while wearing her Army uniform. Some members of the military have faced discipline or gotten warnings for issuing political messages while in uniform.

Gabbard on Monday attacked Romney on Tucker Carlson's show, after the Utah Senator called her a traitor for querying US funding given to Ukrainian biolabs - now at the mercy of Russia.

Speaking to the Fox News host hours after she called on the Utah senator to resign, the former Democratic lawmaker said: 'First of all, I think it's important to point out here that this is not a matter of disagreement or holding a dissenting view.

'This is about facts and this is about the truth, so while senator Romney and all these different talking heads in the mainstream media are regurgitating Hillary Clinton's slanderous talking points, the facts remain.

'Number one is they are accusing me of saying that somehow there are bio weapons labs in Ukraine. I said no such thing at any point.'

Gabbard has raised questions about why the US funded labs in Ukraine that work with biological pathogens, some of which were once destined for Soviet-era bioweapons.

While that material can no longer be turned into weapons, it could still pose a great danger if it is allowed to defrost in the event of a Russian attack on labs where it is stored, causing the power to go off and it to defrost.

The Russians have put out information about the labs for years in what has been called a disinformation campaign, in statements tracked by EU vs. Disinfo

Former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard sought to clarify her comments, and said she is not convinced there are 'biological weapons' labs in Ukraine

Gabbard slammed Utah senator Mitt Romney on Tucker Carlson's show Monday after Romney blasted her for querying US funding to Ukrainian biolabs. The Biden Administration accuses Russia of referencing the labs as part of a disinformation campaign or even set up a 'false flag' chemical or biological attack

Gabbard continued: 'I have said that there are bio labs in Ukraine that have received U.S. support that contain dangerous pathogens that if those labs are breached, then we in the world is facing a potential future of pandemics, that this is a dangerous crisis that needs to be addressed immediate, these pathogens need to be destroyed.

'The second thing they are saying is they deny, even though there is a plethora of evidence that exists, they deny that these bio labs are even there, which is shocking to me, we heard over and over, you played so many clips from people in the mainstream media saying these bio labs, these supposed bio labs, as though they are some fantasy - when over and over and over again officials from our own government, department of state, department of defense, and so on, are saying these bio labs in Ukraine have dangerous pathogens and we are very concerned that they may be breached.

'That is the concern that I've continued to raise because it is not left or right, Democrat or Republican, this is serious safety and health and life concern for the American people and people around the world, and so the media is lying.'

She earlier called on him to resign after he labelled her 'a traitor' for questioning U.S. support for biolabs in Ukraine.

'.@MittRomney and others say that I'm treasonous because I called for a ceasefire around the 25+ biolabs in Ukraine to prevent the breach of such facilities & escape of pathogens, and prevent more pandemics,' she tweeted.

'Romney should resign.'

Gabbard initially sparked anger by asking on Sunday about the security of U.S.-backed laboratories in Ukraine.

The United States has for decades worked with scientists in Ukraine to transform their Soviet-era facilities, some of which were once used for bioweapons, into public health and research sites.

Gabbard asked what was happening in the labs, to prevent the pathogens escaping, and was described by Romney as backing Russian propaganda.

Romney attacked her despite a Department of Defense official warning last month that the labs could be vulnerable to a Russian attack. While the material stored within them could not be turned into weapons, the frozen pathogens could still prove very dangerous if the labs housing them are damaged and they're allowed to defrost.

Russia has accused the U.S. of running bioweapons plants in Ukraine - something that few outside of Russia believe, and which is widely believed to be a myth.

'Tulsi Gabbard is parroting false Russian propaganda. Her treasonous lies may well cost lives,' tweeted Romney.

Romney, a former Republican presidential nominee, has strongly criticized Gabbard for her remarks, which he saw as unpatriotic and supporting the Russian narrative

Gabbard was later asked by Tucker Carlson, Fox News host, about Romney's remarks, and calling her a traitor.

Gabbard insisted that she did not reference - as Carlson did - bio weapons.

She said she only referenced the labs, but said she was the victim of a smear campaign.

'I think it's important to recognize that facts exist, especially in this case, facts exist and the truth is the first casualty of war. And so this is exactly what we are seeing here,' she said.

'People have a very specific agenda, refusing to recognize the truth, refusing to have a conversation and instead were immediately resorting to their tactics of silence, smear, and anyone who dares to say anything they don't like.'

Gabbard is an Army Reserves Lieutenant Colonel posted to a Civil Affairs unit in California.

The report by Department of Defense director Robert Pope that sparked more theories and was behind Tucker Carlson's Fox News segments

The labs Gabbard referred to use material which may have once been used to develop Soviet-era bioweapons, according to a report shared by a Department of Defense director, Robert Pope, in February.

He warned that the same material, which is frozen, could be released into the air with devastating consequences if the labs are damaged during fighting, and it is allowed to thaw.

He stressed, however, that they were not bioweapons facilities, but rather laboratories for medical and other research.

Pope's report, and Carlson's subsequent remarks, have been seized on by Russian propagandists to claim that the United States was actually developing biological weapons in the war-torn nation.

Carlson on Monday said: 'The director of the U.S. Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, a man who would know - a man called Robert Pope - has confirmed that scientists are keeping Soviet-era pathogens for research purposes in Ukraine.

'They told us they were destroying them. They should have destroyed them, but they haven't.

'What could go wrong in an active war zone? And they knew that those pathogens existed and were being experimented upon, researched.'

Pope's bulletin in February said that some of the biological material had previously been used for Soviet-era bioweapons programs, but that Ukraine no longer had the ability to develop such weapons.

Commenting on the significant of Pope's warning, Carlson continued: 'And they didn't secure them before the Russians invaded, though they knew the Russian invasion was coming because they told us.

'And then, Toria Nuland, the Under Secretary of State who oversees this disaster, testified under oath that, yes, Russian forces might seize those biolabs in Ukraine, and we should all be very worried about that possibility.

'Over the weekend, CBS News reported that Pentagon officials have confirmed that these biolabs in Ukraine are, in fact, conducting research on anthrax and other 'deadly pathogens.'

Carlson's broadcasts have been aired on Russian state television, furthering anger among his liberal detractors.

In response to questions from Reuters about its work with Ukraine ahead of and during Russia's invasion, the WHO said in an email on Thursday that it has collaborated with Ukrainian public health labs for several years to promote security practices that help prevent 'accidental or deliberate release of pathogens.'

'As part of this work, WHO has strongly recommended to the Ministry of Health in Ukraine and other responsible bodies to destroy high-threat pathogens to prevent any potential spills,' the WHO, a United Nations agency, said.

The WHO would not say when it had made the recommendation nor did it provide specifics about the kinds of pathogens or toxins housed in Ukraine's laboratories.

The agency also did not answer questions about whether its recommendations were followed.

Carlson said on Monday: 'Tulsi Gabbard addressed and only addressed the danger that innocent people could die because these weapons, apparently these pathogens, these agents, exist in Ukraine.

'She didn't blame him in Russia - she didn't blame anybody. She just said this is a thing.

'Unsecured bio weapons in a war zone are a bad idea. That's not reasonable now? That's treason?

'Reason isn't part of the way people are thinking now.

'Everybody in leadership has completely lost the ability to think beyond the next week.

'Who is thinking about tomorrow or next month or 20 years from now? Not one person.

'And anyone who tries is an agent of Putin.'

Gabbard tweeted that her points were being misconstrued.

She said: 'I'm not convinced there are biological weapons labs or biological weapons in Ukraine—that's not what I'm concerned about. I'm concerned about the existence of the 25+ biological labs in that warzone.

''Biolabs', 'bioweapons labs', and 'bioweapons' are 3 very different things.

'But because these phrases are so similar, there is sometimes miscommunication and misunderstanding when discussing them. I recently experienced this myself. So let me clarify.

''Biolabs' are facilities which contain and experiment with dangerous pathogens, ostensibly for the purpose of serving the public good (i.e. vaccines, etc.).

''Biological weapons labs' are facilities which exist for the purpose of turning pathogens into weapons.

'So they can be used against an enemy (i.e. 'bioweapons').

'The danger of pathogens being released from biolabs in Ukraine is very real, and we need to take action immediately to prevent an impending catastrophe.'

Gabbard is known for courting controversy in foreign affairs.

In January 2017 she traveled to Syria to meet Bashar al-Assad, on a visit that was paid for and run by members of a Lebanese socialist-nationalist party that works closely with the Assad regime. She repaid the money later after criticism.

On the trip, she met only with the regime-approved 'opposition' who said they were against the rebellion against Assad, and she returned to the U.S. blaming Washington for the civil war in Syria.

Earlier this month, Adam Kinzinger, a Republican representing Illinois, went after Gabbard, reminding her of her support for Assad and saying she 'defends him today'.

He called her a 'defender of Russia' whose claims serve as 'Russian propaganda.'

Gabbard's questioning of biolabs on Sunday followed remarks Russia made at the United Nations on Friday.

Russia's claim, widely dismissed, that the U.S. is developing bioweapons in Ukraine raised alarm in the west, amid the suspicion that Russia could be plotting to use chemical or biological weapons as its invasion does not go as planned.

Gabbard's appearances on Fox News with Tucker Carlson have appeared in Russian state-controlled media and have been used in the Kremlin's misinformation campaign

Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the UN, accused Russia of 'lying and spreading disinformation' with its unfounded claims about biological weapons last week.

Russia has provided no evidence of the U.S. supporting Ukrainian bioweapons projects, although the U.S. embassy in Ukraine says the Defense Department's Biological Threat Reduction Program works with the Ukrainian Government 'to consolidate and secure pathogens and toxins of security concern in Ukrainian government facilities.'

The administration and Ukraine have vigorously denied Moscow's claims of funding weapons research in Ukraine.

Russia's ambassador to the UN on Friday accused the U.S. of funding into 'vectors or potential agents of biological weapon' including bats, birds, fleas, and lice.'

Russian state media has made use of Gabbard's claims, which come as Moscow is seeking to portray Ukraine as both controlled by Nazis and threatening Russia with dangerous weapons.

Russia's spokeswoman for the foreign ministry, Maria Zakharova, also accused Ukraine of launching 'attacks against their own nuclear facilities.'

Zakharova tweeted: 'The blame for this lies squarely with Kiev, the American masters of Vladimir Zelensky and US vassals in @NATO.'

The administration fears Russia's highlighting the conspiracy theory could foretell a new stage in the conflict.

'The intent behind these lies seems clear, and is deeply troubling,' said Thomas-Greenfield.

'We believe Russia could use chemical or biological agents for assassinations, as part of a staged or false-flag incident, or to support tactical military operations.'

Russia has long raised the allegations, which it brought up again last week as Russian forces pummeled Ukrainian cities.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10615639/I-said-no-thing-Tulsi-Gabbard-denies-claiming-making-bioweapons-Ukraine-says-Mitt-Romney-RESIGN-doesnt-evidence-claims-treasonous.html
1,3bfc2464-760b-4858-bce9-5bc3f82e4f6a,[],,"The United States says that Ukraine will be given long-range missile defense and Switchblade armed drones, enabling Kyiv’s forces to better defend against Russian aircraft and armor from a distance.

The new arms and equipment that US President Biden announced for Ukraine include:

S-300 long-range missile defense

Ukraine has had the ability to shoot down Russian aircraft and cruise missiles at relatively close quarters. Washington is arranging for it to acquire systems that can strike attacking aircraft from much farther away.

According to a military source, the systems are the Soviet/Russian-made S-300, which like the US-made Patriot system, is a fully automated, ground-based radar-and-missile launcher unit that can detect, track and fire at multiple incoming aerial threats at long distances.

Ukrainians already know how to operate the S-300, and the United States and a number of NATO countries possess the systems or components of them to supply Ukraine.

‘Kamikaze drones’

Washington will send Ukraine 100 Switchblade drones, essentially camera-equipped, remote-controlled flying bombs that can be directed by an operator to find and then, when ready, plunge onto a target, exploding on contact.

Dubbed “kamikaze drones,” Switchblades can extend the range of attack on Russian vehicles and units to beyond the sight of the user. That gives them an advantage over the guided heat-seeking missiles that Ukrainians have used against Russian tanks.

Anti-aircraft Stingers

The United States is also giving 800 more Stingers, which are shoulder-mounted infrared anti-aircraft missiles. The US provided Stingers to Afghan fighters in the 1990s to shoot down Russian helicopters; Ukrainians have used them effectively against Russian helicopters and slower, lower-flying fixed-wing attack aircraft.

‘Saint Javelin’

Western allies have already provided the Ukrainian army with some 17,000 lightweight, shoulder-launched, self-guided missiles which have become the weapon of choice in the ground war. These are being used with great effect to destroy armored vehicles at close quarters.

Among those, the US-made Javelin, with dual charges designed to defeat Russian tanks’ anti-missile defenses, has become legendary in its effectiveness. A popular Ukrainian song extols it and there is now even a viral depiction of “Saint Javelin,” an Eastern iconography-style image of a woman cradling the weapon. Biden said Washington will send 2,000 more javelin missiles to Ukraine.

Guns, ammunition, body armor

The new US arms provisions also include 7,000 other anti-armor weapons, thousands of machine guns, rifles, and grenade launchers, 20 million rounds of small arms ammunition fitting both Russian and NATO standards, and 25,000 sets of body armor and helmets.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-march-17-2022/

Yes, unequivocally, as this “becoming something” is already occurring, in fact, globally.



The devil is in the details, I leave you with a very good quote to ponder:

""...one of the contradictions of Soros' activism: On the one hand, he propagates an ""open society"" without central planning of a powerful elite. On the other hand, he himself plans together with a powerful elite. He enters into a partnership with a world power and builds on the means and networks of their secret service. This world power and its intelligence service pursue above all power and geopolitical goals with their promotion of former Soviet and now Russia-critical intellectuals. Russia should be weakened and not an independent power factor in world politics. In the end, it is about supremacy and market shares, ultimately about profit for a few and not about the self-determination of peoples."" The democracy of George Soros by Jens Berger https://www.nachdenkseiten.de/? p=34805



That quote is from this website:https://akf-europe.org/zurueckweisung-des-anschwellenden-bocksgesangs-zur-verleumdung-der-andersdenker/



That article by Paul Schreyer was either written or at least published for public access on the internet March 27, 2019.



If there are any problems with the translation from German into English that I have cited, blame Google/Apple translation bots.



I was able to read the full article, apparently that was written by Paul Schreyer, including any and all references to “Jens Berger”.



At the end of the article by Paul Schreyer, which that quote about the contradictions of Soros’ activism comes from, there is a notation about the title of the Book that Paul Schreyer wrote: Paul Schreyer is a freelance journalist, author, employee and regular author of NachDenkSeiten. His book ""We are the good ones - views of a Putin understander or how the media manipulate us"" (with Mathias Bröckers) became a Spiegel bestseller.”



So I am presuming that he is a media pundit that supports Putin, at least back in 2016. At this point in time, I do not find his personal or other biases relevant to the cited text.



There is also this little note still viewable in 2022, today at 03/17/2022 at 9:41am EST in US at the bottom of the Paul Schreyer website that refers to problems with the internet, and accessing direct access of the quote, like who said what, and when, and where any of something said comes from:

“Note: The website soros.dcleaks.com with the leaked Soros documents was no longer accessible for a few days and we cannot say if and for how long the page will remain online after the publication of this text. Thus, the link to the 44-page protocol of the Soros visit to Ukraine of March 2014, which has been quoted several times in this article, may also lead to nothing. The NachDenkSeiten have backed up the document in good time and make it available to their readers at this alternative link.""



(https://www.nachdenkseiten.de/upload/pdf/160830_Ukraine-Working-Group-2014_gs-ukraine-visitmarch-2014notes.pdf)



That second link worked. That second link, labelled alternative link is one of the most important bits of information to understand the scenario of the conflict that is occurring in the real, and on the only place human beings can attempt to survive with various levels of cooperative efforts, the planet earth, at the more specific physical location of Ukraine(48.3794° N, 31.1656° E.) at this time. In fact that link is so significant to understanding any thing about the scenario of the conflict in Ukraine. That hyper-link is from 2014. I am presuming that the text is a relatively reliable documentation of the Breakfast with US Ambassador Geoffrey Pyatt, at which said gathering, George Soros attended and is referenced as participating in the verbal discussion that occurred March 31, 2014. I was not there. I did not personally witness the words, or the people saying those words. I am relying on other reporters and their initial reporting of facts, with their opinion notations, observations and conclusions, if any.



So, the quote way up at the top of this comment is from way back in 2016, at least, if not earlier. Also note, the specificity of the “note” quote as to reliability issues at the time of 2016 through 2022. Also note the information about the 2014 Soros participatory visit at the breakfast with US Ambassador of the time, Geoffrey Pyatt, which could also include further critical details that could affect any one reader’s conclusion, presuppositions, assumptions, or in popular slang terminology “take-aways”, relevant or not relevant. Also note the geo-locaters of Ukraine.



I am not attempting to address any opinions, mine included, however, I am attempting to reveal some of the aspects of the problems of “real time issues” versus “no time issues” and whether or not any action that should have been contemplated and addressed way back before even 2014 should have been approached reasonably, and rationally with international contracts that address real human issues way before any of those real issues escalated to the level of discord in 2014, and now even to a fever pitch in 2022.



So, who’s to blame guys? Really, now? Who is in what boat, and where, and when? Who is floating on what? Who is just SOL?



PS: Every Jens Berger that pops up on a brief Google search, look pretty capable, representative of reasonable pursuits, so take your pick as to which one is the real Jens Berger that was cited in the opening quote. I’m not playing favorites at this point in time. I am accepting the credibility of all the players, yes even the ones that performed any actions in real-time with any positive impact and results.



PPS: Parading a ""Z""around with or without clothes is not going to change any nightmare either.



So, in other words, due to the facts that nothing has been done by the 1,2,3-be my guest take any number-game, you are getting the results that are affecting the global body and system. Oh, remember who created what? What have you created lately?",https://www.project-syndicate.org/bigpicture/the-nuclear-nightmare-in-ukraine

President Joe Biden warned Chinese President Xi Jinping that Beijing would face consequences if it provides “material support” to Russia amid its invasion of Ukraine, the White House announced Friday.

“President Biden detailed our efforts to prevent and then respond to the invasion, including by imposing costs on Russia,” said a White House readout of the call hours after it concluded.

“He described the implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia as it conducts brutal attacks against Ukrainian cities and civilians,” the WH added.

The White House has not detailed what those consequences would be.

Top Russian negotiator: Moscow & Kiev get closer on Ukraine’s neutral status

Moscow and Kiev have achieved certain progress in the ongoing talks, getting their positions on Ukraine’s potential status “as close as possible,” the head of the Russian delegation, Vladimir Medinsky, said Friday.

“The topic of neutral status and non-accession of Ukraine to NATO is one of the key issues of the negotiations. This is the issue on which the parties have brought their positions as close as possible,” Medinsky stated, adding, “Then details begin relating to what security guarantees Ukraine receives in addition to the already existing in case of its refusal to join the NATO bloc.”

Other questions however, namely Russian demands to “demilitarize” and “denazify” Ukraine, remain the subject of debate. The delegations are only “halfway” into finding common grounds on the former issue, Medinsky revealed, while the situation with the latter remains “rather strange,” with Kiev continuing to deny the very existence of neo-Nazis in the country.

“Ukrainian colleagues believe that there are no Nazi formations in Ukraine,” the official explained.

Ukraine’s negotiator at talks with Russia on Friday announced Kiev’s position was unchanged and it wanted peace negotiations to lead to a ceasefire, the withdrawal of Russian troops and security guarantees

US: Russian soldiers don’t appear to be “particularly motivated” about Ukraine war

Russian soldiers do not seem “to be particularly motivated,” Gen. Frank McKenzie, the Commander of US Central Command, told reporters during a briefing at the Pentagon Friday.

Putin tells Macron Russian troops are doing everything they can to save civilian lives

In another phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron, Russian President Vladimir Putin stressed that during the special operation in Ukraine, the Russian Armed Forces are doing everything they can to save the lives of civilians, the Kremlin press service announced.

It added that the presidents had continued to exchange opinions on the situation around Ukraine.

“Responding to the concerns voiced by Emmanuel Macron, the Russian president emphasized once again that during the special military operation the Russian Armed Forces are doing everything they can to save the lives of civilians, including through organizing humanitarian corridors for their safe evacuation,” it said.

The president drew Macron’s attention “to numerous war crimes committed on a daily basis by Ukrainian forces and nationalists, in particular massive missile and artillery strikes on Donbass cities,” according to the Kremlin.

Macron told Putin he is “extremely concerned” about Mariupol

French President Emmanuel Macron has told his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, that he is “extremely concerned” about the situation in Mariupol, which has been hit by constant shelling over recent days, according to the French presidential office.

The call lasted just over one hour, the Elysee added.

“The [French] President again brought up the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine, the continued strikes hitting civilians and failure to respect humanitarian law while negotiations between the Russian and Ukrainian delegation have for now not led to any progress,” according to Macron’s office.

UN: 6.5 million displaced inside Ukraine due to war

The UN migration agency estimates that nearly 6.5 million people have now been displaced inside Ukraine, on top of the 3.2 million refugees who have already fled the country.

Zelensky: 130 rescued, ‘hundreds’ under Mariupol theatre rubble

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated that 130 people had been saved after the bombing of a theatre in the port city of Mariupol under Russian siege, but “hundreds” were still trapped in the rubble.

Ukraine accused Russia of hitting the theatre on Wednesday. It had been feared that up to 1,000 people may have been taking refuge underground at the time of the blast. Russia has denied responsibility for the attack.

Western states say Russia using UN to spread propaganda

Russia is using the UN Security Council to spread disinformation and propaganda about its invasion of Ukraine, six Western members states have stated.

They made the allegation at a council meeting called at Russia’s request to discuss its allegations that Ukraine is developing biological weapons.

“Russia is once again attempting to use this council to launder its disinformation, spread its propaganda, and justify its unprovoked and brutal attack on Ukraine,” the six countries with seats on the council said in a statement read out by US ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield.

She was accompanied by representatives of France, Norway, Albania, Ireland and Britain.

Dutch & Germans to send 3 Patriot missile defence systems to Slovakia

The Dutch government has said it would send a Patriot missile defence system to Sliac, Slovakia, as part of NATO moves to strengthen air defences in Eastern Europe.

“The worsened safety situation in Europe as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine makes this contribution necessary,” Defense Minister Kajsa Ollongren said in a statement.

Germany is also sending two Patriot systems to Slovakia, the statement said.

Ukraine says Russian forces not made fresh advances

Ukraine’s Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Malyar has said Ukrainian troops had prevented Russian troops from making any fresh advances.

Speaking on national television, Malyar added Russian forces had food and fuel supply issues and communications problems.

The Armed Forces of Ukraine have also issued an upbeat assessment of their defense of Kyiv, saying Russia’s two main routes for attacking the capital city have been blocked.

In the face of a campaign to apparently encircle the capital ahead of a possible attempt to take it, Russian forces on both sides of the Dnipro river — which divides the city north to south — have been stopped, according to Oleksandr Hruzevych, deputy chief of staff.

“As of today, the enemy has been stopped at a distance of almost 70 kilometers (about 43 miles) from the city’s right bank, which makes it impossible to carry out fire, except for rocket fire. On the left bank, the advance has [also] been stopped. The enemy is cynically shooting at our infrastructure facilities. [But] the main ways of attack are blocked,” he said Friday.

Russian forces had abandoned offensive actions around Brovary to the northeast of Kyiv, and Boryspil to the southeast, Hruzevych added. After creating two lines of defense to protect the capital, Hruzevych noted Ukraine’s army was now “working on strengthening a third, distant line of defense.”

Xi tells Biden: “Conflict not in anyone’s interest”

Conflict and confrontation is not in anyone’s interest, Chinese President Xi Jinping said to US President Joe Biden on a video call Friday morning, according to Chinese state media.

“State-to-state relations cannot go to the stage of military confrontation. Conflict and confrontation are not in the interests of anyone. Peace and security are the most cherished treasures of the international community,” CCTV quoted Xi as saying on the call.

China and the US have a responsibility to ensure peace, Xi told Biden.

“As permanent members of the UN Security Council and the world’s two largest economies, we must not only lead the development of China-US relations down the correct path, but also shoulder our international responsibilities and make efforts for world peace and tranquillity,” Xi is reported to have said on the video call.

“The world is neither peaceful nor tranquil,” Xi acknowledged, adding, “The Ukraine crisis is something we don’t want to see.”

Lavrov warns Russia will target any weapons shipments entering Ukraine

Moscow to retaliate to diplomatic expulsions

Putin: Main goal of Russian operation in Ukraine is to set Donbass free from genocide

Setting free the people of Donbass from the “genocide” being waged against them is the main goal of the Russian special operation in Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin stated on Friday.

“[The Donbass residents], who did not agree with the [2014] coup [in Kiev], were immediately hit with punitive military operations. A blockade was immediately put in place against these people. They were subjected to systematic shelling, air strikes. This is what is called ‘genocide’,” he continued.

UN: At least 816 civilians killed in Ukraine since conflict began

The UN rights office (OHCHR) said on Friday that at least 816 civilians had been killed and 1,333 wounded in Ukraine through to March 17.

Most of the casualties were from explosive weapons such as shelling from heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes, OHCHR added.

The real toll is thought to be considerably higher since OHCHR, which has a large monitoring team in the country, has not yet been able to verify casualty reports from badly-hit cities like Mariupol.

NATO chief says 100k US troops now in Europe

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has announced that there are now 100,000 US troops in Europe as NATO ramps up its presence on the bloc’s eastern flank amid Russia’s ongoing special military operation in Ukraine.

Stoltenberg argued that the number of American servicemen in Europe has increased by several thousand over the past few weeks and that they remain on “heightened alert”.

He described the deployment as NATO’s “immediate response sending a clear message to Moscow that an attack on one ally will trigger a response from the whole alliance”.

Baltic nations expel ten Russian diplomats

Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania have expelled a total of ten Russian diplomats, the foreign ministries of the three Baltic countries have said.

EU has ‘very reliable evidence’ China considering military support for Russia

EU leaders are in possession of “very reliable evidence” that China is considering military assistance to Russia, a senior EU official told POLITICO, threatening potential trade measures if weapons’ deliveries go ahead.

It follows a similar warning from US officials earlier this week that the Russian government had asked China for military equipment and other support.

“EU leaders have very reliable evidence that China is considering providing military aid to Russia. All the leaders are very aware of what’s going on,” the senior EU official stated on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak publicly about confidential information.

He did not say what kind of assistance Moscow had requested.

“We are concerned about the fact that China is flirting with the Russians,” he added.

The EU will “impose trade barriers against China” should Beijing proceed with Russia’s request, he noted, as “this is the only language Beijing understands.”

Ukraine president says he expects progress on EU membership bid within months

President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he spoke with the head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and Ukraine expects progress to be made on its application to join the EU in the coming months.

“Had substantial conversation with EC President,” Zelenskyy wrote on Twitter, adding, “EC opinion on Ukraine application for EU membership will be prepared within few months. Ukraine Government and EC are instructed. Moving to our strategic goal together.”

The deputy chief of staff of Zelenskyy has also said Ukraine will not abandon its bid to join the EU to reach a compromise with Russia as part of an agreement to end the war.

“I will be categorical, this is absolutely unacceptable. It is our choice, the application for EU membership has been submitted and now it is being put into practice,” deputy chief of staff Andrii Sybiha added.

Speaking on national television, Sybiha stated negotiations with Russia were ongoing but difficult.

Russia’s request to suspend World Cup playoff rejected

The Court of Arbitration for Sport on Friday refused to suspend FIFA’s ban on Russia taking part in the playoffs for the 2022 World Cup finals that was imposed over the invasion of Ukraine.

The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) is still to rule on the legal basis of the ban, but a decision is not expected for several weeks at least.

“The challenged decision remains in force and all Russian teams and clubs continue to be suspended from participation in FIFA competitions. The CAS arbitration proceedings continue,” the court announced in a statement.

The Football Union of Russia had appealed against the suspension, hoping to gain permission to allow Russia to face Poland in a World Cup playoff that was due to have been played on March 24.

UN refugee agency says fewer Ukrainians fleeing

A UN refugee agency official said on Friday that daily crossings by people fleeing violence in Ukraine have slowed in recent days, noting warmer weather might be a factor.

“We have seen a slowdown, a general slowdown,” stated Matthew Saltmarsh via videolink from Poland, adding that warmer weather might be a factor.

However, he warned that any escalation of violence in the Western Ukrainian city of Lviv might cause crossings to rise again.

At least 3.25 million refugees have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion, the United Nations announced Friday.

Russian finance ministry says it has met coupon payment obligations in full

Kremlin: Chance of Putin-Zelensky’s meeting depends on settlement deal

A possible meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Vladimir Zelensky in order to sign an agreement on the current situation’s settlement will depend on the modality of the document, which is yet to be agreed upon, Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday.

India defends purchases of Russian oil

Indian government officials on Friday defended the continued buying of Russian oil, saying European countries were still purchasing hydrocarbons from Moscow and that high crude prices left New Delhi with little choice.

Indian oil refiners have in recent days reportedly purchased several million barrels of discounted Russian oil even as the West seeks to isolate Moscow economically over its invasion of Ukraine.

But an Indian government official stated on Friday that the world’s third-biggest consumer of crude relied on imports for almost 85 percent of its needs, with Russia supplying a “marginal” less than one percent of this.

“Geopolitical developments have posed significant challenges to our energy security. For obvious reasons, we have had to stop sourcing from Iran and Venezuela. Alternative sources have often come at a higher cost,” the official noted on condition of anonymity.

Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Kremlin says UK decision to revoke RT’s broadcast licence is ‘madness’

Kremlin says Biden’s remarks about Putin amount to “personal insults”

US President Joe Biden’s remarks about his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin amount to personal insults, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday.

“Moscow hears and sees what is already daily statements made by President Biden, which are already, in fact, personal insults of Putin,” Peskov told reporters on a regularly held conference call.

Speaking at the annual Friends of Ireland Luncheon on St. Patrick’s Day in Capitol Hill on Thursday, Biden said Putin was “a murderous dictator, a pure thug,” who is waging an immoral war against the people of Ukraine.”

Peskov added that he didn’t want to react harshly to these statements in view of Biden’s “irritability, fatigue and forgetfulness” and so as “not to cause more aggressiveness.”

“Taking into account President Biden’s irritability, fatigue and forgetfulness, which lead to such aggressive statements, we will not give sharp assessments of his words, so as not to cause more aggressiveness,” he continued.

Biden’s comments Thursday came a day after he first called Putin a war criminal — a significant escalation in his rhetoric condemning the Russian leader’s actions against Ukraine.

Peskov told reporters on Thursday Biden’s comments were “absolutely unacceptable and inexcusable.”

World Food Programme says supply chains ‘falling apart’ in Ukraine

A World Food Programme (WFP) official announced on Friday that food supply chains in Ukraine were collapsing, with a portion of infrastructure destroyed and many grocery stores and warehouses now empty.

Putin tells Scholz Kyiv stalling peace talks with Moscow

Russian President Vladimir Putin told German Chancellor Olaf Scholz during a phone call on Friday that Kyiv was attempting to stall peace talks with Russia but that Moscow was still keen to continue negotiations.

“It was noted that the Kyiv regime is attempting in every possible way to delay the negotiation process, putting forward more and more unrealistic proposals,” the Kremlin said in a readout of the call.

“Nonetheless the Russian side is ready to continue searching for a solution in line with its well-known principled approaches,” it added.

Scholz called for a ceasefire in Ukraine during the phone call with Putin, a German government spokesperson said.

In their nearly hour-long conversation, Scholz also stressed that the humanitarian situation needed to be improved and progress needed to be made in finding a diplomatic solution as soon as possible, added the spokesperson.

Putin has also complained of Ukrainian attacks in eastern Ukraine during the phone call with Scholz, the Kremlin has said in a statement.

According to Moscow, Ukrainian missile launches targeted residential areas in the cities of Donetsk and Makeyvka, and resulted in a “significant number of human casualties”.

“These war crimes have been ignored by the West,” the statement added.

FM: Russia’s illusions about West are over

Moscow has lost all illusions about relying on the West and Moscow will never accept a view of the world dominated by a United States that wants to act like a global sheriff, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said.

He expressed hope that the current “abnormal” situation between Russia and Ukraine will be resolved, but warned that the West is going to prevent this from happening.

Elaborating on the influence that Western countries have on Ukraine, Lavrov pointed at the allegations of biological weapons being created in the Eastern European country under US supervision.

The West will continue to impose sanctions on Russia but Moscow is used to it, Lavrov stated.

“The sanctions drive is going to continue and they are threatening the fifth wave. Maybe there will be another wave but we are used to it,” he noted.

“As President [Vladimir] Putin recalled, we are now champions in the number of sanctions introduced against the Russian Federation, more than 5,000 individual acts, almost twice as many as was introduced against Iran and North Korea. But sanctions always made us stronger,” Lavrov pointed out.

The foreign minister noted that there is no such thing as independent western media, adding that “we are not closing the door to the west – they are closing the door”.

He also claimed that the Kremlin’s goal is to remove any threat to Russia on Ukrainian soil.

Russia suspects Pentagon-funded bioresearch laboratories in foreign nations, including those in Ukraine, may pose a threat because of the secrecy surrounding their work, Lavrov told RT. Washington apparently didn’t want to risk exposing its own people to the pathogenic threat, he suggested.

“The Americans some years ago decided that it was too dangerous to do [such research] on their own soil. So, they moved all these threatening and dangerous activities to other countries,” Lavrov claimed.

Lavrov stated that, in his assessment, there were more than 300 biolabs worldwide involved in research for the Pentagon. He noted Russia does not rule out the possibility that Ukraine could be the Pentagon’s largest bio-laboratory project.

Macron: Russia’s offensive in Ukraine is ‘electroshock’ to NATO

Russia’s ongoing military offensive in Ukraine has delivered an “electroshock” to NATO, France’s President Emmanuel Macron said. The remark came in response to a journalist’s question regarding the president’s 2019 characterization of the military alliance as “brain dead,” and whether the French head of state was still of that opinion.

Macron added that he stood by his initial ‘diagnosis,’ taking “full responsibility” for his words; however, according to the French president, Russia’s military campaign against Ukraine has been a wake-up call for NATO.

Macron pointed out that the “war launched by President [Vladimir] Putin” at the alliance’s doorstep created an “unusual threat which gives a strategic clarification to NATO.”

He also stated that the military alliance in its current form would not cut it, standing by his earlier calls for reform.

Pope calls Ukraine war a ‘perverse abuse of power’ for partisan interests

Pope Francis has called the war in Ukraine a “perverse abuse of power” waged for partisan interests which has condemned defenceless people to brutal violence.

His latest condemnation came in a message to a Catholic Church conference in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia.

Ukraine FM says he discussed further Russian sanctions with EU’s Borrell

UK: Kharkiv, Chernihiv & Mykolaiv remain encircled

It added: “The UN now states that the number of refugees fleeing the conflict in Ukraine has already surpassed 3.2 million. This number will continue to rise as a result of ongoing Russian aggression.”

China maintains independent stance on Ukraine crisis as US threatens backlash for supporting Russia

Beijing adheres to an independent position on the Ukrainian crisis, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Friday, commenting on Washington’s threats to take action in event of China’s support for Russia. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday that US President Joe Biden will make clear to his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, during their phone call scheduled for Friday that Beijing will face consequences for supporting the Russian operation in Ukraine. “Regarding the Ukrainian issue, China has always made independent judgments based on the merits of the case in an objective and fair manner,” Zhao told reporters. Some people in the US continue to spread false information, slander, and pressure China, which is extremely irresponsible behaviour that does not help resolve the crisis, the diplomat added.

Ukraine: Russia lost 14,200 servicemen

Ukraine’s Defense Ministry has announced that Russia lost some 14,200 servicemen since the invasion began on February 24, including about 200 in the past 24 hours.

The New York Times reported on Wednesday that Russia lost some 7,000 soldiers in Ukraine.

There is no way to verify the claims of both sides.

Russian Defense Ministry Spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov stated on Friday a total of 183 Ukraine’s unmanned aerial vehicles, 1,406 tanks and other armored combat vehicles, 138 multiple rocket launchers, 535 field artillery pieces and mortars and 1,197 military motor vehicles have been destroyed since the start of Moscow’s special military operation.

Russia: Fighting in Mariupol city centre

NATO understands Zelensky’s ‘frustration, desperation’

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stated he understands the “frustration and desperation” of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky and promised to continue arms shipment to Ukraine.

“I fully understand the frustration and the desperation that President Zelensky and the Ukrainian people feel, because they are in an extremely difficult situation,” Stoltenberg said during the joint press conference with German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock.

“They see civilian casualties and destruction every day,” he added.

“This is why NATO allies have stepped up their support, also delivering advanced weapon systems, air and missile defense and anti-tank weapons, fuel and ammunition,” Stoltenberg stated, underscoring that the alliance intends to continue these shipments.

He also underlined that NATO has been actively assisting in development of the Ukrainian army since 2014, that the alliance has “trained tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops which are now on the front line.”

Earlier in Berlin, Stoltenberg reiterated that NATO has no intention to take part in the conflict in Ukraine, emphasizing that NATO has an obligation to protect its own territory.

Zelensky warns mercenaries joining Russian forces: “worst decision of your life”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned those trying to join Russian forces in Ukraine it would be “the worst decision of your life,” in a video message.

“Long life is better than the money you are offered for a short one,” Zelensky said.

He claimed Ukraine has information the Russian military is recruiting mercenaries from other countries, but said this will not help them.

Ukrainian forces are still holding all key areas of the country, he added.

New Russian conscripts have been taken as prisoners, Zelensky said — but added, “We do not need 13 or any number of thousands of dead Russian soldiers.”

Addressing Russian people, he stated, “We didn’t want this war. We only want peace. And we want you to love your children more than you fear your authorities.”

Ukrainian ambassador to the UN confronts Russian counterpart about women & children killed in attacks

Ukrainian Ambassador to the UN Sergiy Kyslytsya directly addressed his Russian counterpart during the UN Security Council on Thursday about the women, children and elderly killed by Russians in Ukraine.

“Ambassador, do the eyes of Ukrainian children, women, and elderly killed by the Russians flash before you?” Kyslytsya asked.

He continued, “If they do, we may consider how to sponsor a decision to help you deal with perpetration-inducted traumatic stress. But now, have some decency and stop the egregious manipulation of the Security Council. It is obscene.”

Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia did not respond to the comments during Thursday’s Security Council meeting, but told reporters after the meeting that he does not “engage in personal exchanges” with Kyslytsya.

“But when he asked about the eyes of children killed, I would also like to ask him whether he had any remorse when he thought about the children of Donetsk that were killed by Ukrainian forces,” Nebenzia said.

Kyslytsya also spoke to reporters after the meeting, adding there has not been any improvement in the situation in Ukraine.

“No, there is no improvement. The actions of the Russian Federation continue to be very brazen and the atrocities are taking place every day, unfortunately,” Kyslytsya noted.

UK: “Faltering” Russian troops face logistical challenges like food shortages

The Russian military continues to face logistical problems in its “faltering invasion of Ukraine,” Britain’s Ministry of Defence announced in a statement.

In its latest intelligence update, the ministry said Russian forces were being prevented from resupplying “forward troops with even basic essentials such as food and fuel,” due to their inability to control Ukrainian airspace and challenges on the ground.

Russian forces have been reluctant to maneuver across the country, the ministry added, but did not provide additional details on its knowledge of Russia’s strategic moves.

“Reluctance to maneuver cross-country, lack of control of the air and limited bridging capabilities are preventing Russia from effectively resupplying their forward troops with basic essentials such as food and fuel,” the ministry said.

“Incessant Ukrainian counterattacks are forcing Russia to divert large numbers of troops to their own supply Iines. This is severely limiting Russia’s offensive potential,” it added.

Australia imposes new sanctions on Russian banks & oligarchs

Australia on Friday announced new sanctions against 11 Russian banks and government entities, according to a statement from Foreign Minister Marise Payne.

“Today’s listing includes the Russian National Wealth Fund and the Russian Ministry of Finance. With our recent inclusion of the Central Bank of Russia, Australia has now targeted all Russian Government entities responsible for issuing and managing Russia’s sovereign debt,” she added.

“The majority of Russia’s banking assets are now covered by our sanctions along with all of the entities that handle Russia’s sovereign debt,” she continued.

WHO says it has 43 verified attacks on healthcare in Ukraine

The World Health Organization has verified 43 attacks on healthcare in Ukraine that have killed 12 people and injured dozens more, including health workers, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the United Nations Security Council.

“In any conflict, attacks on healthcare are a violation of international humanitarian law,” Tedros told the 15-member council, without specifying who was to blame for the attacks.

White House cites ‘high concern’ China may provide Russia with weapons

The White House has announced it had “high concern” that China could provide Russia with military equipment to aid its invasion of Ukraine, and President Joe Biden would be candid and direct in an upcoming phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said China’s failure to denounce Russia’s actions “speaks volumes”.

Biden and Xi will discuss Russia’s invasion of Ukraine Friday, according to a White House statement released Thursday.

Biden will warn Xi on Friday that he will face “costs” if China rescues Russia from intense Western sanctions aimed at punishing Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

The phone call — the first known discussion between the two leaders since November — comes after recent assertions from US officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, that Russia has asked China for military support in Ukraine. Beijing and Moscow have both denied the claims.

Blinken said China bears “responsibility” to use its influence with Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop the war in Ukraine.

“We continue to call on all nations, especially those with direct influence with Russia, to use whatever leverage they have to compel Moscow to end this war of choice. We believe China in particular has a responsibility to use its influence with President Putin and to defend the international rules and principles that it professes to support,” Blinken stated.

“Instead, it appears that China is moving in the opposite direction by refusing to condemn this aggression while seeking to portray itself as a neutral arbiter. And we’re concerned that they’re considering directly assisting Russia with military equipment to use in Ukraine. President Biden will be speaking to President Xi tomorrow and will make clear that China will bear responsibility for any actions it takes to support Russia’s aggression and we will not hesitate to impose costs,” he added.

Mayor of Velykoburlutska in northeastern Ukraine “captured” by Russian forces

Viktor Tereshchenko, mayor of Velykoburlutska in Ukraine’s northeastern region of Kharkiv, has been captured by Russian forces, Oleh Syniehubov, Kharkiv Regional State Administration head, confirmed.

“We have news today that [the Russians] captured the head of the Velykoburlutska community, Viktor Nikolaevich Tereshchenko. Such people need to have security. Victor Nikolaevich was kidnapped simply from his workplace and taken to the local police station. They are holding him and will not release him,” Syniehubov said.

The locals condemn the act, he added, and said he is working to free the village leader as soon as possible.

“Soon our occupied territories will be ours again,” he added.

While Russian forces have not taken Kharkiv, they “continue their terror against the civilian population, in particular against the heads of territorial communities of Kharkiv region today,” Syniehubov stated.

US: Russian forces “continue to want to conduct a siege of Kyiv”

Russian forces “continue to want to conduct a siege of Kyiv,” a senior US defense official told reporters, based on troop movements and the types of weapons Russian forces are moving from the rear “to join their advancing elements.”

While Russian forces have not moved closer to Kyiv’s city center over the last 24 hours, the US has observed that Russian forces are moving some forces “from the rear to join their advancing elements,” and “some of those forces, some of those capabilities are artillery, long-range artillery,” the official said.

Because of that, “it appears” that Russian forces “continue to want to conduct a siege of Kyiv,” the official added, “cause that’s what you want to use artillery for.”

“They clearly are trying, particularly around Kyiv to improve their ability to hit the city from afar with munitions,” the official continued.

Russian military has documentary evidence US funded bioexperiments in Ukraine

The Russian army has obtained documentary evidence confirming the Pentagon was involved in financing military biological projects in Ukraine, the chief of Russia’s radiation, chemical and biological protection force, Igor Kirillov, has said.

“We believe that components of biological weapons were being created in Ukraine,” Kirillov added. He demonstrated a document dated March 6, 2015 confirming “the Pentagon’s direct involvement in financing military biological experiments in Ukraine.”

He stressed that it was standard practice to fund US sanitary and epidemiological wellbeing projects in third countries, including those in Africa and Asia, through national health service agencies.

Ukrainian biolabs continue to destroy biological materials and documentation on the research of dangerous viruses, Kirillov noted.

“Information continues to be received about attempts to destroy biomaterials and documentation in laboratories in Ukraine. We know that during the liquidation in the laboratory of veterinary medicine in the settlement of Khlebodarskoye, working employees, citizens of Ukraine, were not even allowed into the building,” he continued.

Ukrainian Defense Ministry laboratories in Kiev, Odessa, Lvov and Kharkov received $32 million funding from the US, Kirillov had claimed.

China calls US, NATO initiators of Ukraine crisis

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian on Thursday refuted US State Secretary Antony Blinken’s accusations that China’s unwillingness to condemn Russia’s “special military operation” is inconsistent with China’s position on the UN Charter.

China always stands for respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries and abiding by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, Zhao noted during a regular press conference.

Blinken’s China-smearing remarks fully revealed the US side’s Cold War mentality and bloc confrontation thinking, Zhao said, adding that such remarks will not help solve the problem.

On the Ukraine issue, China has always adopted an objective and fair attitude and made judgments independently based on the merits of the matter itself, the spokesperson reiterated, adding that China believes the security concerns of all countries must be taken seriously and supports all efforts that are conducive to the peaceful settlement of the crisis.

As a responsible, major country, China will continue to play a constructive role in maintaining world peace and stability, Zhao said.

He stated the US government’s decision on NATO’s eastward expansion is directly related to the current Ukraine crisis and stressed that the key to solving the crisis lies in the hands of the US and NATO.

As the initiators of the crisis, the US and NATO should reflect on their role in the crisis, effectively assume responsibility, and take practical action to de-escalate the situation and solve the issue, Zhao continued.

He also called on the US to work together with the majority of the developing countries in the world, stand on the side of peace and justice and promote the early de-escalation of the situation in Ukraine.

5,3bfc2464-760b-4858-bce9-5bc3f82e4f6a,[],,"MR PRICE: Good afternoon.

QUESTION: Hello.

MR PRICE: One element at the top, and then I look forward to your questions.

As the President said today, America stands with the forces of freedom in Ukraine.

To that end, we are leading the effort to isolate President Putin on the global stage while also simultaneously strengthening Ukraine’s hand at the negotiating table. What’s at stake here are the principles of freedom, the right to determine one’s own future. A right that Ukrainians have shown the world they will fight to preserve.

In recent weeks, the United States has sent $300 million in humanitarian aid – tens of thousands of tons of food and medicine for displaced families fleeing Russia’s premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified war. U.S. humanitarian aid personnel are on the ground in the region assessing needs in real time.

And just as President Biden pledged we would, we have also surged security assistance to our Ukrainian partners so that they can defend themselves.

As Russia began its military buildup last year, the United States delivered $650 million in military equipment to Ukraine, building on a growing security cooperation relationship dating back to 2014.

As the conflict started, we sped 350 million more in equipment to help bolster Ukraine’s defenses.

Now, this week we are authorizing $1 billion more of arms and equipment, including types already used successfully by Ukraine’s security forces to defend their country against Russian aggression.

Today’s announcement nearly doubles total security assistance to Ukraine since the beginning of the administration to more than $2 billion, enabling us to surge additional needed assistance, including anti-aircraft, anti-tank, anti-armor systems as well as small arms and munitions used by Ukrainian security forces on the ground right now in their fight to defend their country.

Among the items included in this new package are 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems; 2,000 Javelin, 1,000 light anti-armor weapons, and 6,000 AT-4 anti-armor systems; 100 Tactical Unmanned Aerial Systems; 100 grenade launchers, 500 rifles, 1,000 pistols, 400 machine guns, and 400 shotguns; in addition to over 200 million rounds of small arms ammunition and grenade launcher and mortar rounds; and more.[1]

In addition to the U.S.-produced short-range air defense systems the Ukrainians have been using to great effect, the United States has also identified and is helping the Ukrainians acquire from our partners and allies additional, longer-range systems on which Ukraine’s forces are already trained, as well as additional munitions for those systems.

The United States continues to expedite the authorization and facilitation of additional assistance to Ukraine from our allies. At least 30 countries have provided security assistance to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began. In 2022, this year, the Department of State has authorized third-party transfers of defensive equipment from more than 14 countries, a number that continues to grow as allies and partners increase their support to Ukraine.

As the President said, this could be a long and difficult battle, but America will be steadfast. America will continue to answer the call. The United States, our allies and partners, we are united in supporting Ukraine in its time of need.

With that, happy to take your questions.

QUESTION: Thanks, Ned. I actually – I have some Iran questions, but I guess we’ll start with Ukraine because I think that’s probably on the top of everyone’s mind. When you speak about additional long-range systems that you – longer-range systems that the Ukrainians are already trained in, you’re talking about the S-300s, or are you talking about – is it broader than just that? And —

MR PRICE: Well, so, Matt, what we are doing and what I referred to now is the fact that we are continuing to pursue solutions to help our Ukrainian partners acquire long-range anti-aircraft systems and the munitions they would need for those systems, and the President also alluded to this in his remarks today. I can’t get into the full specifics of this, but we are continuing to work with our allies, with our partners to surge new assistance, and that includes Soviet or Russian-origin anti-aircraft systems and the necessary ammunition to employ them every day to Ukraine. Those are the systems on which they’re already using, the systems on which they are already trained and have actually demonstrated great effect already.

We have said that we welcome assistance from countries around the world. As I mentioned a moment ago, more than 30 countries across the globe have provided defensive security assistance to Ukraine. The United States has – the Department of State, I should say, has authorized the provision of U.S.-origin equipment from at least 14 countries, but we know that —

QUESTION: Right, but —

MR PRICE: — many more are standing up.

QUESTION: But this isn’t U.S.-origin?

MR PRICE: That’s correct. That’s correct.

QUESTION: So without getting into the actual nitty-gritty specifics of what systems they are and what countries, although it would be nice to know what countries you’re in discussions with about this, what does the U.S., if anything, have to do to facilitate the transfer of such systems? And secondly, can you – I mean, are you close to reaching an agreement with any of the potential donor countries?

MR PRICE: What do we have to do to facilitate the transfer of non-U.S.-origin equipment?

QUESTION: Well, yeah, legally – correct.

MR PRICE: So first, for U.S.-origin equipment, of course there are waivers that are necessary given ITAR provisions and other applicable provisions. The Secretary has repeatedly, with more than 14 countries, authorized the provision of such U.S.-origin equipment to our Ukrainian partners, and we’ve done so on an extremely expedited basis, turning those around in the course of a day.

When it comes to working with countries that may have Russian-made, Soviet-origin equipment, obviously that is not equipment for which we would need to provide any sort of waiver or any sort of formal paperwork. What we are doing, however, is sharing our assessment of the security needs that our Ukrainian partners have – precisely the needs they have, the threat they are under, the types of fires and munitions that they are enduring from President Putin’s forces, and working with them to determine what they may have in their inventories, to marry that with what we have in our inventories, with our knowledge, with their knowledge of what the Ukrainians already have, the training they already have, to determine the most effective package that will allow them to defend themselves.

QUESTION: Well, are you – can you say if you’re close to an agreement with any – or is it —

MR PRICE: We are having these discussions every day. Thirty countries around the world have already provided security assistance to Ukraine, and we’re having these discussions daily.

QUESTION: Okay, and then the last one is just that – and if a deal is struck, and I realize it’s a hypothetical, so you probably won’t answer, but let me try anyway – if you do get a country X or country Y, or both X and Y, to provide Ukraine with these systems, is – are you – is the U.S. prepared to make up for those? Because I mean presumably if country X and Y give those systems to Ukraine, the Russians most likely aren’t going to want to sell them replacements, right?

MR PRICE: Well, I will —

QUESTION: So is the U.S. going to be, or any ally – are you in discussions to replace those systems that countries might give up?

MR PRICE: I always appreciate when you answer the question for me. I will note that that is a hypothetical. I will also note, however, that we have continued to provide forms of reassurance to our allies, including our allies on the eastern flank. The Department of Defense recently spoke of the two Patriot missile batteries that had been moved into Poland. We know that countries that are valiantly standing up, that are providing defensive weaponry from their own stocks, they too have their own security needs. When it comes to the NATO Alliance, certainly we will continue to stand by our NATO Allies to make certain that NATO has the power, the capability to defend itself.

Yes.

QUESTION: Just a quick one. I have a – there are – I think there are drones in the package of new equipment. I wonder if you can confirm that there are these Switchblade drones are part of that, and any details you can give.

MR PRICE: I’ve seen quite a bit of reporting over the last 24 hours on that particular system. I think I understand why, when you see the video of it. Look, I can’t confirm particular systems. The President did speak of, or we did speak of tactical unmanned aerial systems. We provided and are providing a hundred of those systems. The system that you referred to would be an anti-armor system. It is certainly consistent with the type of defensive weaponry that we’re providing. But I’m just not in a position to speak to all the specific systems that may be included in that package.

QUESTION: Okay, then can we move onto the negotiations, discussions going on between the Ukrainians and the Russians?

MR PRICE: Sure.

QUESTION: There are some signs, some noises coming from both sides that there might be some movement on that. I wondered if you had a view on the potential for an agreement there, and there’s a discussion about an agreement that would see Ukraine kind of pledge neutrality, not join NATO, like a Sweden or Austria kind of neutrality, and then also have security guarantees from other countries. Could the U.S. be a guarantor of some kind of an agreement like that?

MR PRICE: Well, we welcome the sentiments expressed that there is hope, that there is optimism for diplomatic progress. But what Ukraine needs now more than sentiments, more than hope, more than optimism, is de-escalation, is an end to the violence, is a tangible indication that President Putin is changing course. And that is something we have not yet seen. And just as I was coming down here, there are more horrifying reports of shelling, of destruction of what appear to be civilian sites across Ukraine, including in Mariupol.

We’ve made clear that we unequivocally support Ukraine’s efforts to achieve peace, to bring an end to the mounting human suffering from President Putin’s war of choice. Diplomacy is always going to be at the center of these efforts. But we remain clear-eyed, as do our Ukrainian partners, as you heard from President Zelenskyy, as you’ve heard from the foreign minister, as you’ve heard from others. It remains our position that Russia needs to halt its campaign of death, of destruction immediately. And we are working simultaneously to do all we can to give Ukraine the strongest hand it can have at the negotiating table, and we’re doing that in a couple different ways.

We’ve already spoken to one of those ways at the top of this briefing when we detailed some of the security assistance that we’re providing to Ukraine, $2 billion over the past year, $1 billion in the past week alone. That is certainly an important element of that. The other part of that effort to strengthen Ukraine’s hand at the negotiating table is what the United States and our allies and partners have brought to bear on the Kremlin, on the Russian Federation, including its economy and its financial system.

We have placed unprecedented pressure on the Russian economy, on its financial system, and every day you see very tangible metrics of that. The stock market remains closed, will remain closed for at least the remainder of this week and potentially even longer, presumably in an effort to prevent capital flight. The ruble is virtually worthless; it is literally worth less than a penny. Russia is on the verge of default; its credit rating is at junk status. Hundreds of international companies are fleeing the Russian market. And we can go on and on.

Now, all of that is part and parcel of our effort to strengthen that Ukrainian position. So we see Ukraine day by day will have a stronger hand as these measures have even more effect on the Russian economy, on the Russian financial system, and as we, together with our allies and partners here, too, continue to provide Ukraine with the defensive security assistance that our Ukrainian partners need to defend themselves inside their own territory.

Yes.

QUESTION: I just wanted to dig on that a little further, Ned, because certain export controls exist on some of these systems that the two gentlemen mentioned. So is the State Department going to take the lead in talking to allies and easing those export controls, or maybe changing them altogether? And especially given Ukraine’s desperate need, how can you work through those obstacles to maybe get them the aid that they need faster, especially with the export —

MR PRICE: Well, I think we have proven throughout the course of this conflict, and even before it, that we are not going to let any sort of technical barrier stand in our way. And I’ve already spoken to the expedited procedures that we have used to approve the provision of U.S.-origin equipment to Ukraine. We have done that in many cases with less than 24 hours notice. The fact that – it was just a couple weeks ago that we announced an additional $350 million in security assistance to Ukraine; within four or five days, more than 70 percent of that vast sum had already been delivered.

So I think that speaks to the fact that we are breaking through not only what might be otherwise burdensome bureaucratic processes and hoops, but we are doing so with alacrity here in this department. Our colleagues at the Department of Defense are doing the same. We know that our allies and partners around the world are doing the same on their end precisely because we recognize the urgency with which our Ukrainian partners need these defensive supplies.

So if there are procedures that we need to go through here at the Department or elsewhere within the government to see to it that appropriate and effective systems are provided to our Ukrainian partners, whether that is from our stocks, whether that is U.S.-origin materiel from the stocks of our allies and partners, or materiel that is non-U.S.-origin, that may even be Russian-made or Soviet origin, we will see to that.

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: Yes. So Poland’s Deputy Prime Minister Kaczyński, Jarosław Kaczyński, was in Kyiv yesterday along with leaders of Poland and Czechia and Slovenia. And he called for a peacekeeping mission to Ukraine with the involvement of NATO troops. So is that something that the U.S. would be willing to entertain?

And somewhat relatedly, President Zelenskyy yesterday said that he would like to see more leaders coming to visit him. Are there any chances of U.S. officials doing that?

MR PRICE: So on your first question, of course, it’s not up to us to speak for NATO. What I can say is essentially what we have heard from the NATO secretary general, is that the Alliance of course is squarely focused on putting an end to this war, bringing this brutal aggression to a close. Just as NATO is, we are intently focused on doing the same. In the same vein, we want to avoid doing anything that would prolong this war or that would expand this war. And having American service members on Ukrainian territory, American pilots in Ukrainian airspace, NATO service members on Ukrainian soil, NATO pilots in Ukrainian airspace – of course that has the potential not to bring this war to a close but to expand it to something that is even larger and much more grave in terms of its implications.

In terms of U.S. officials visiting Ukraine, you’ll know that it was just last week that Secretary Blinken met with his foreign minister counterpart, Foreign Minister Kuleba, on the Polish-Ukrainian border. They actually conducted part of that meeting on sovereign Ukrainian soil, the very sovereign – very sovereignty that Ukrainians are so valiantly and bravely and courageously standing up to defend.

QUESTION: Right, but that – it’s a little bit different than going to Kyiv and meeting with Zelenskyy. Stepping across the – I mean, not that it wasn’t a symbolic show of support or anything, but there are no plans to do similar to what the three European —

MR PRICE: The White House has announced plans for the President to go to Brussels. That is the only presidential travel I’m aware of at the moment.

QUESTION: Oh, yeah. I’m talking about – okay. Well, but I’m talking about lower than the President. I mean, and just to follow up on Simon’s question earlier about this idea of neutrality and security guarantees, is this something – I realize that you said that what Ukraine needs right now – what they need immediately is de-escalation and a sign that Putin has changed his – changing course. But in the more medium term, is this something that you guys are willing to consider? Because, frankly, I think a lot of us, including Ukraine, thought they already had security guarantees from the Budapest Memorandum. So is the U.S. ready to look at the Budapest-plus agreement that expands the number of guarantors?

MR PRICE: So this is – in terms of the diplomacy, this is not a question for us regarding what might lead to a ceasefire, a diminution of violence between Ukraine and Russia. This is ultimately a question for our Ukrainian partners to decide – to decide the terms of diplomacy, what they are willing to pursue, what they are not willing to pursue.

This is really at the heart of this conflict, this needless war of aggression that President Putin and his forces are waging. They are waging this war precisely because they sought to deprive Ukraine of its sovereign rights, its sovereign right to determine its own foreign policy, its sovereign right to determine its own Western orientation, its sovereign right to choose its own partners and alliances.

So as part and parcel of that, it is not for us to say the terms by which Ukraine and Russia may be in a position to reach an agreement that we all hope could diminish the violence. That is for Ukraine to decide. We will be standing by our Ukrainian partners, assisting them with the diplomacy as we know a number of our allies and partners around the world are doing. But these are questions for the sovereign state of Ukraine.

Yes.

QUESTION: Hi. Just a follow-up on this question. More generally, is it good idea, is it wise idea, to sign something under the Russian shelling? And yes or no, if it end up signing some kind of agreement, could one expect that United States will be a part of this agreement?

MR PRICE: I missed the first part of your question. It is a —

QUESTION: Is it generally good idea, wise idea to sign a peace agreement during the shelling?

MR PRICE: Well, we continue to believe that there must be a diplomatic resolution to this war, and that is why we are standing with our Ukrainian partners as they continue to engage in diplomacy, why we’ve been consulting and coordinating so closely with our French allies, our German allies, our Turkish allies, our Israeli partners, and others who have been involved in various diplomatic efforts to try and bring this brutal war to a close.

But we know something else to be true, and that is that diplomacy will have the best chance of success not in the context of escalation but in the context of de-escalation. And to your point, we – and to what I said earlier – have not yet seen any indication that President Putin is willing to de-escalate. In fact, we have seen escalation after escalation. As the Secretary said yesterday, President Putin has continued to put his foot on the accelerator. It is time to put the brakes on this conflict. It is time to see a diminution of the violence. It is time to see de-escalation. It is time to see the Russians take steps that spare additional lives.

Let me go around.

QUESTION: Thank you. Getting away from the specifics for a minute, I have slightly more of a philosophical question.

MR PRICE: Sure.

QUESTION: You and others in the administration have repeatedly spoken about how united you and your NATO Allies are. And my question is whether you think this is a permanent resolution of the differences and frictions that came up with NATO and the United States over the last four years or if this is sort of a unique convergence of events and there are still – will still be a lot more work to do in terms of the U.S. working with NATO.

MR PRICE: Well, I would make the point that any disagreements or disharmony between the United States and NATO came to a close in January of last year, long before this conflict. Secretary Blinken’s first travel to the European continent, you probably recall, was to Brussels. He went to a NATO ministerial. If I recall, his second travel to the continent of Europe was to Brussels, where he attended a NATO ministerial just a few weeks later.

So we have demonstrated from the very first hours of this administration, when Secretary Blinken spoke to the NATO secretary general – and of course, the President has had conversations as well – the indispensability of the NATO Alliance and the fact that to us NATO’s Article 5, the principle that an attack on one is an attack on all, is as sacrosanct today as it was 70-plus years ago when the NATO charter was signed.

Now, I think it is true that the Alliance, in the buildup and in the wake of Russia’s aggression, is as united, as focused, and as purposeful as it has been since the end of the Cold War. It has really brought into focus the reason for being of the Alliance in the first place. I also think – and you can – I’ll let countries speak for themselves, but this brings up once again the point that President Putin, through his actions, has in fact precipitated everything that he has sought to prevent. And a number of countries that just a few short months ago probably would have demurred if asked about any NATO aspirations have given different answers. Of course, I think that the value of NATO, its purpose, its reason for being today is as in focus as it ever has been.

Yes.

QUESTION: I know it’s not your department per se, but – so today’s call between Jake Sullivan and General Patrushev, is this not a – because this is the first – correct me if I’m wrong, but this is the first high-level contact since the beginning of the invasion. So is this not a positive signal or – that the sides are coming together? Or how are we supposed to interpret that?

MR PRICE: I wouldn’t quite characterize it in quite those terms. I will speak – I won’t speak for the White House; they will speak to their own engagements. What I can say is that the last time Secretary Blinken had been in contact with his counterpart was in the immediate aftermath of the potential meeting in Geneva coming down. And this was, of course, right in the midst of the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. And I say that I might characterize this contact a bit differently because, as the White House laid out, the National Security Advisor outlined in very clear terms for his counterpart our commitment to continuing to impose costs on the Russian Federation, our commitment to continuing to support the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of our Ukrainian partners.

He also took advantage of the conversation to make very clear that there would be significant consequences and implications were the Russian Federation to use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine. So I think this speaks to the fact that there are some very weighty, very consequential issues that are now on the table. There are some very weighty concerns that we have. And so we are going to – we are not going to pass up an opportunity to convey those concerns and to convey the potential implications if we think that direct contact is in our interest.

Paul.

QUESTION: Can I go to Iran?

MR PRICE: Sure.

QUESTION: So where are we? The Iranians say there’s two issues left, which presumably are that they want guarantees from the U.S. and they – against another policy change, and they want the IRGC to be cleared of being named a terrorist group. Can those issues be bridged, and do you expect them to be bridged soon? And secondly, can you – what do you think of the – Britain’s ability to get back its hostages and the coincidental timing of them releasing Iranian funds?

MR PRICE: So to your first question, we do think the remaining issues can be bridged. We do think, and we – as we said before, we have made significant progress, we are close to a possible deal, but we’re not there yet. From our end, we are not going to characterize the number or the nature of these remaining issues precisely because we are at a very delicate stage.

We want to do everything we can to see to it that a mutual – well, to determine if a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA is in the offing, and it would need to be in the offing in the short term. As we’ve said, there is little time remaining, given the nuclear advancements that Tehran has made, that over time would obviate the non-proliferation benefits that the JCPOA conveyed. So this is an issue that needs to be worked urgently. It is an issue that has had our urgent attention for some time now. We still continue to believe that a mutual return to compliance would be manifestly in our interests, and we are going to find out in the near term whether we’re able to get there.

When it comes to the news you referred to today, let me just say that we welcome the news regarding British citizens Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori. We, of course, would refer you to our British counterparts for specific questions on their status. When it comes to our efforts, we continue to work night and day to secure the release of our wrongfully detained citizens, and that includes U.S.-UK citizen Morad Tahbaz.

Simply put, Iran is unjustly detaining innocent Americans and others, and Tehran should release them immediately. Securing their release is an utmost priority for this administration. We call upon Iran to make urgent progress toward the release of wrongfully detained U.S. citizens. I can tell you that Special Envoy Malley and Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Carstens, they have been regularly speaking with the families of our detainees. They’ll continue to do so, particularly to pass along the status of any progress to bring their loved ones home. In fact, they spoke with the families of all four wrongfully detained U.S. citizens just yesterday.

QUESTION: Does the British release of funds to Iran make it more difficult for you to obtain the release of Americans without doing the same kind of gesture?

MR PRICE: Well, this was a sovereign UK decision. We were not a party to this decision. It doesn’t change the fact that we are going to continue working night and day to do everything we can to bring our citizens home.

Yes, Rich.

QUESTION: Thanks, Ned. Also, this is my first time in the briefing this week, and I want to thank you for your thoughtful words yesterday; for the support of the State Department for our colleagues, for Ben, Pierre, and Sasha; and all the support that you’ve given us. And I know it means a lot to the bullpen, it means a lot to Fox, and it means a lot to me. So thank you for that.

MR PRICE: Rich, it’s why we’re here; to help citizens, help those in need. So we’ve – we welcome the good news; we hope to hear more of it.

QUESTION: Great, thank you. Moving on to an Iran question, there’s a report in Axios that the administration is considering removing the IRGC from the FTO list in return for a public commitment from Iran to de-escalate in the region. Is that something that you can confirm?

MR PRICE: It’s not something I can speak to. It’s not something I can speak to beyond the fact that there are two key issues at the heart of these negotiations. On the one hand, you have the nuclear commitments that Tehran would need to adhere to were it to resume full compliance with the JCPOA. On the other side of the ledger, you have the sanctions relief that the United States, working with our P5+1 partners, would be prepared to provide if we were to achieve a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA. So the issue of sanctions relief is really and has been at the heart of these negotiations, but we’re just not going to speak to specifics at this stage.

QUESTION: Does the IRGC’s missile launches near an American consulate change that calculation? And with that in mind, does the administration still think it would be appropriate for that to even be considered?

MR PRICE: What it underscores for us is the fact that Iran poses a threat to our allies, to our partners, in some cases to the United States, across a range of realms. The most urgent challenge we would face is a nuclear-armed Iran or an Iran that was on the very precipice of obtaining a nuclear weapon. Every challenge that we face and would face from Iran – whether that is its support for proxies, its support for terrorist groups, its ballistic missile program – all of those challenges would become all the more difficult to confront if Iran were in the possession of a nuclear weapon. Iran would be able to act with far greater impunity if it were in possession of a nuclear weapon.

So we are determined to continue to confront all of those threats working in tandem with our allies and partners, just as we are determined to take that central potential threat off the table – the threat of an Iranian nuclear weapon. That is what we are seeking to do by testing the proposition that, through a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA, we can reimpose the permanent, verifiable limits on Iran’s nuclear program to see to it that Iran is never able to acquire a nuclear weapon.

QUESTION: Is the administration committed, if there is an agreement, to submitting an agreement to congressional review and waiting out the 30-day period before lifting any sanctions?

MR PRICE: Well, what I can say at this point, Rich, we obviously don’t have an agreement of any sort, but we will carefully consider the facts and circumstances of any U.S. return to the JCPOA to determine the legal implications, including those under INARA. We’re committed to ensuring the requirements of INARA are fully satisfied.

The President believes that a bipartisan approach across our foreign policy – and we’ve been heartened to see this on a number of issues recently, including on Ukraine, with a $13.6 billion in appropriations, a large chunk of which we spoke to today – but we believe that a bipartisan approach to our foreign policy, including to Iran, is the strongest way to safeguard U.S. interests in the long term. And we have reached out at all levels to members of Congress and their staffs to discuss our approach to Iran. This very week, there have continued to be briefings on the Hill. Special Envoy Malley, Brett McGurk at the White House, others are deeply committed to this continued close engagement with Congress in a bipartisan manner during the negotiations and for whatever comes next.

QUESTION: But that sounds as though you’re not committing to INARA review.

MR PRICE: It should sound as though we are committed to ensuring the requirements of INARA are fully satisfied.

QUESTION: But that doesn’t mean that you’re submitting it – I mean, that’s not a pledge to submit it to that – through that review process.

MR PRICE: Matt, as I said before, we don’t have a deal.

QUESTION: Yes, okay.

MR PRICE: This is a hypothetical, but if and when there is any sort of agreement, we are committed to ensuring the requirements of INARA are fully satisfied.

QUESTION: Yesterday, you were a bit circumspect about Foreign Minister Lavrov’s comments with the Iranian foreign minister at their meeting in Moscow in which he said – you talked – he suggested – his comments appeared to suggest at least that the last-minute Russian objections or their concerns about Ukraine sanctions essentially bleeding over into the JCPOA, that those were resolved. You said that you didn’t think there was really ever an issue in the first place, but have you gotten any more clarity from – not directly from the Russians, presumably, but through anyone else that it is – this issue is, in fact, now resolved and the Russians won’t blow a deal up?

MR PRICE: Well, what I will say is that we have spoken to a very small number of outstanding issues in addition to – call it what you will – I think Mr. Borrell called it external factors.

QUESTION: Right.

MR PRICE: So there have been external factors in addition to outstanding issues. Even if these external factors are fully resolved, and without speaking to them in detail, we’ve seen the comments from senior Russian officials that would seem to suggest that they are in a different place, have been in a different place over the past couple days, than they might have been a few days before that. Even if external factors are removed, we still have some ways to go until and unless we’re able to —

QUESTION: Understood, but as far as – your understanding is that those external factors are now reduced or no longer there?

MR PRICE: These external factors were not about us in the first place, so it would not be our place to comment on whether they’re resolved or not.

QUESTION: And then I think I can probably guess your answer to this question, but I just want to know, today is the day that you’re supposed to – that the Secretary is supposed to make a determination as to whether to continue the protection for former Secretary Pompeo and Special Envoy Hook. Has he done that? And if he has, what did he decide?

MR PRICE: Well, Matt, we don’t discuss the specifics of protective operations. As you know, Congress has approved authorities that allow the Department of State to protect former or retired senior department officials if the Secretary, in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, determines that the official faces a credible threat from a foreign power or the agent of a foreign power arising specifically from duties that that former official pursued while employed by the Department of State.

And so under Section 7071 of the Appropriations Act, again, the Secretary, in consultation with the DNI, determines and then reports to congressional leadership and the appropriate congressional committees if a former or a retired senior State Department official would receive protection. We have up to $30 million in appropriated funds to be made available if such a determination is made, but I think you can understand why we wouldn’t speak publicly to whether we have made such a determination, as that would potentially pose a security issue.

QUESTION: Well, not only would it potentially pose a security issue, but it would also be problematic if you were to lift a FTO designation against the IRGC when they’re – if you determine that the threats that they have made to those two men continue to exist.

MR PRICE: You heard from the National Security Advisor. It’s a statement he issued I believe on January 9th, where he made crystal clear that any effort to harm a U.S. citizen, be it on U.S. soil, anywhere in the world, whether that person was a former official, current official of any party, it is something we would take extraordinarily seriously. There is nothing we take with more gravity than the protection, the safety of U.S. citizens. So I will leave it at that.

Yes, Simon.

QUESTION: I want to kind of come back to Ukraine, but specifically the meeting that the National Security Advisor held with his Chinese counterpart in Rome. Assistant Secretary Kritenbrink you said was there; he’s now returned to Washington, I believe, and I guess had time to debrief you on that or debrief the Department on that. Is there anything more you can tell us about – we understand the message that was given in that meeting, that there are these concerns about China supporting Russia’s war in Ukraine. But at the conclusion of the meeting or coming out of that meeting, what’s your reading on what China’s view is going forward on supporting Russia in Ukraine and whether they’re giving material support?

MR PRICE: So it’s not for us to characterize what the PRC view on this or any other issue may be or is. It is for us to characterize the messages that were conveyed very clearly in the course of our diplomacy. And as I indicated two days ago now, one of the reasons – probably the most important reason – we convene at high levels with our PRC counterparts is to ensure that those lines of communication remain open. This is probably the most consequential bilateral relationship on the face of the Earth. It is incumbent upon us as a responsible country to see to it that the competition that characterizes our relationship doesn’t veer into the realm of conflict. And, of course, dialogue and discussion is part of that.

When it comes to the PRC’s approach to Russia and Ukraine, a number of countries – the vast majority of the world’s countries – have stood up with and for our Ukrainian partners. They have stood up against President Putin’s aggression against Ukraine. We have yet to see those – that sort of unambiguous statement from the PRC or that sort of unambiguous support from the PRC, and we’ve made very clear to the PRC that we have significant concerns, and that any effort to compensate Russia for its financial losses, for the economic toll, or, of course, any effort to supply, to provide materiel for Russia’s war effort – that would be met with significant costs not only from the United States but from our allies and partners around the world.

Those are the messages that were conveyed. It is not up to us to characterize any sort of PRC response.

QUESTION: Right. You said you’ve yet to see an unambiguous statement from the Chinese. Have you seen any signal or any indication since that meeting from the Chinese of what their position might – is there any change to their position?

MR PRICE: I will leave it to our PRC counterparts to speak to their position.

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: I want to turn to Venezuela.

MR PRICE: Sure.

QUESTION: After the trip to Caracas of a senior U.S. delegation to meet with government – with the government of President Nicolás Maduro, is the U.S. still recognizing Juan Guaidó as the interim president? Are you planning follow-up meetings with Maduro? And are you concerned that these kind of meetings weaken the Venezuelan opposition?

MR PRICE: Well, as we talked about a couple days ago, the visit to Venezuela focused on really two things, and that was securing the release of wrongful detainees and urging the Maduro regime to return to the negotiating table in Mexico with the democratic opposition’s unitary platform to restore democracy in Venezuela. So far from undermining Juan Guaidó, it actually reinforced our support for Interim President Juan Guaidó and his call for a negotiated solution through the Mexico process. There, of course, has been no change in our recognition of Interim President Juan Guaidó’s role. We will continue to work with him as such. We will continue to urge the resumption of negotiations through the Mexico City process.

QUESTION: But does it mean a recognition that who’s in power is, like, Nicolás Maduro and not Juan Guaidó? Because the delegation didn’t go to the house of Juan Guaidó, it went to meet Maduro officials.

MR PRICE: In one way, it was a recognition that it was the Maduro regime that was and continues to hold Americans unjustly against their will. It, of course, was not Juan Guaidó or the unitary platform that held and continues to hold, unjustly, American detainees. So if we seek the return of Americans who are held unjustly against their will, in that case we met with the party that was holding them.

Thank you all very much.

He says Russians are preventing supplies from reaching surrounded cities in the center and southeast of the country.

“This is a totally deliberate tactic,” Zelenskyy said in his nighttime video address to the nation, filmed outside in Kyiv, with the presidential office in the lamplight behind him.

He said more than 9,000 people were able to leave besieged Mariupol in the past day, and in all more than 180,000 people have been able to flee to safety through humanitarian corridors.

He again appealed to Russian President Vladimir Putin to hold talks with him directly. “It’s time to meet, time to speak,” he said. “I want to be heard by everyone, especially in Moscow.”

He noted that the 200,000 people Putin gathered in and around a Moscow stadium on Friday for a flag-waving rally was about the same number of Russian troops sent into Ukraine three weeks ago.

Zelenskyy then asked his audience to picture the stadium filled with the thousands of Russians who have been killed, wounded or maimed in the fighting.

OTHER DEVELOPMENTS TODAY:

NEW YORK — Three Russian cosmonauts have arrived at the International Space Station wearing flight suits in yellow and blue colors that match the Ukrainian flag.

The men were the first new arrivals on the space station since the start of the Russian war in Ukraine last month.

Video of one of the cosmonauts taken as the capsule prepared to dock with the space station showed him wearing a blue flight suit. It was unclear what, if any, message the yellow uniforms they changed into were intended to send.

Oleg Artemyev was asked about the yellow flight suits when the newly arrived cosmonauts were able to talk to family back on Earth.

He said every crew chooses its own flight suits, so that they are not all the same.

“It became our turn to pick a color. But in fact, we had accumulated a lot of yellow material so we needed to use it. So that’s why we had to wear yellow,” he said.

Artemyev, Denis Matveyev and Sergey Korsakov blasted off successfully from the Russia-leased Baikonur launch facility in Kazakhstan in their Soyuz MS-21 spacecraft at 8:55 p.m. Friday (11:55 a.m. EDT). They smoothly docked at the station just over three hours later, joining two Russians, four Americans and a German on the orbiting outpost.

LVIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine lost access to the Azov Sea during Russia's siege of the southern port city of Mariupol, the Ukrainian General Staff said late Friday.

Mariupol is the key commercial port on the Azov Sea, which is connected to the much larger Black Sea by a narrow strait.

The General Staff said the Russian forces were still trying to storm Mariupol and the fighting was ongoing. It was unclear from its statement whether the Russians have seized the city.

KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine’s interior minister said Friday that it will take years to defuse unexploded ordnances after the Russian invasion.

Speaking to The Associated Press in the besieged Ukrainian capital, Denys Monastyrsky said that the country will need Western assistance to cope with the massive task once the war is over.

“A huge number of shells and mines have been fired at Ukraine and a large part haven’t exploded, they remain under the rubble and pose a real threat,” Monastyrsky said. “It will take years, not months, to defuse them.”

In addition to the unexploded Russian ordnances, the Ukrainian troops also have planted land mines at bridges, airports and other key infrastructure to prevent Russians from using them.

“We won’t be able to remove the mines from all that territory, so I asked our international partners and colleagues from the European Union and the United States to prepare groups of experts to demine the areas of combat and facilities that came under shelling,” Monastyrsky told the AP.

He noted that another top challenge is dealing with fires caused by the relentless Russian barrages. He said there’s a desperate shortage of personnel and equipment to deal with the fires amid the constant shelling.

UNITED NATIONS — Russia’s first deputy U.N. ambassador says Twitter has blocked his account, accusing him of “abuse and harassment,” due to a tweet about the maternity hospital in the besieged southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol.

“This is very deplorable,” Dmitry Polyansky told reporters after a U.N. Security Council meeting Friday, “and this clearly illustrates how much alternative view and free press, and free information is valued by Twitter and in this country.”

Polyansky, who had more than 22,000 followers and was a prolific Twitter user, said he received a message earlier Friday from Twitter’s cloud service saying he was violating Twitter’s rules and was “engaged in abuse and harassment.”

He said Twitter referred to his warning in a tweet on March 7 “that the hospital in Mariupol had been turned into a military object by radicals. Very disturbing that UN spreads disinformation without verification.”

Associated Press journalists, who have been reporting from inside blockaded Mariupol since early in the war, documented the March 10 attack on the maternity hospital and saw the victims and damage firsthand. They shot video and photos of several bloodstained, pregnant mothers fleeing the blown-out maternity ward as medical workers shouted and children cried.

PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday asked Russian President Vladimir Putin to lift the siege of Mariupol, allow humanitarian access and order an immediate cease-fire, Macron’s office said.

Macron spoke with the Russian leader on the phone for 70 minutes. Earlier in the day, Putin had a conversation with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who also pressed for an immediate cease-fire.

Macron, who has spoken numerous times with Putin, revisited complaints over repeated attacks on civilians and Russia’s failure to respect human rights in Ukraine, the presidential Elysee Palace said.

It said that Putin, in turn, laid the blame for the war on Ukraine.

Macron, who is campaigning to renew his mandate in April elections, said during a town hall-style meeting shortly before the call that he talks to Putin because he believes there is a way toward peace, between the Ukrainian resistance, tough Western sanctions and diplomatic pressure. “We must do everything to find it,” he said.

KYIV, Ukraine — A Ukrainian officer in charge of defending the region around the country’s capital says his forces are well positioned to defend the city.

Maj. Gen. Oleksandr Pavlyuk said in an interview with The Associated Press that “the enemy is halted,” adding that “we are improving this system of defensive lines” to make Kyiv “inapproachable for the enemy.”

Despite three weeks of Russian bombardment, Ukraine has kept up a stiff defense of its cities. Fighting continued in Kyiv’s suburbs, depriving thousands of heat and clean water.

“From time to time, the enemy tests our defenses,” said Pavlyuk, a battle-hardened officer who earned his rank by leading Ukrainian troops in the conflict with Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine that erupted in 2014. “But our boys are strong in their positions and also play an active role in preventing the enemy to fulfill their plans.”

Pavlyuk, who has been put in charge of Kyiv’s defenses earlier this week, said that the Russians are using the same tactics as they used in the east to target civilian structures to try to break Ukraine’s resistance.

“That’s why now that war has been transformed into killing civilians, destroying civilian infrastructure, to frighten our people to the maximum,” he said. “But we will never give up. We will fight until the end. To the last breath and to the last bullet.”

UNITED NATIONS — Six Western nations have accused Russia of using the U.N. Security Council to launder disinformation, spread propaganda, and justify its unprovoked attack on Ukraine. And the U.S. is again warning that Moscow’s claim that the U.S. has biological warfare laboratories in Ukraine “is really a potential false flag effort in action.”

Friday’s council meeting was supposed to be for a vote on Russia’s draft resolution on humanitarian relief for Ukraine which has been widely criticized for making no mention of Moscow’s invasion of its neighbor. Russia instead raised allegations again of U.S. involvement in biological warfare activities, which have been repeatedly denied by both the United States and Ukraine.

The six Western nations — U.S., U.K., France, Albania, Ireland and Norway — delivered a joint statement just before the council session, saying: “This meeting and these lies are designed for one purpose, to deflect responsibility for Russia’s war of choice and the humanitarian catastrophe it has caused.”

They stressed that Russia has long maintained a biological weapons program in violation of international law and has a well-documented history of using chemical weapons — not Ukraine.

“There are no Ukrainian biological weapons laboratories — not near Russia’s border, not anywhere,” U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said.

Reiterating the Biden administration’s serious concern of a potential false flag effort, the U.S. envoy said, “We continue to believe it is possible that Russia may be planning to use chemical or biological agents against the Ukrainian people.”

MOSCOW — The head of the Russian delegation in talks with Ukrainian officials says the parties have come closer to an agreement on a neutral status for Ukraine.

Vladimir Medinsky, who led the Russian negotiators in several rounds of talks with Ukraine, including this week, said Friday that the sides have narrowed their differences on the issue of Ukraine dropping its bid to join NATO and adopting a neutral status.

“The issue of neutral status and no NATO membership for Ukraine is one of the key issues in talks, and that is the issue where the parties have made their positions maximally close,” Medinsky said in remarks carried by Russian news agencies.

He added that the sides are now “half-way” on issues regarding the demilitarization of Ukraine. Medinsky noted that while Kyiv insists that Russia-backed separatist regions in Ukraine’s east must be brought back into the fold, Russia believes that people of the regions must be allowed to determine their fate themselves.

Medinsky noted that a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is possible after the negotiators finalize a draft treaty to end the hostilities and it receives a preliminary approval by the countries’ governments.

Medinsky also bristled at a recent statement by Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Zelenskyy, who called for disrupting railway links to supply Russian troops in Ukraine, saying it could undermine the talks.

LVIV, Ukraine — The president of Belarus, who has allowed Russia to use his country's territory to invade Ukraine, says he has no intention to host Russian nuclear weapons.

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has beefed up military ties with Moscow after Western sanctions over his crackdown on protests after his reelection to a sixth term in an August 2020 vote that the opposition and the West rejected as rigged. He has

Lukashenko had previously offered to host Russian nuclear weapons, but in an interview with Japanese broadcaster TBS released by his office on Friday, he said he has no such plans.

“I’m not planning to deploy nuclear weapons here, produce nuclear weapons here, create and use nuclear weapons against anyone,” he said, dismissing the allegations of such plans as an “invention by the West.”

Lukashenko said that he had made an earlier statement about a possible deployment of Russian nuclear weapons to Belarus in response to the talk in the West about a possible redeployment of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons from Germany to Poland.

The Belarusian leader noted that the constitutional amendments approved in a vote last month that shed Belarus’ neutral status has no relation to nuclear weapons.

GENEVA — The U.N. migration agency estimates that nearly 6.5 million people have now been displaced inside Ukraine, on top of the 3.2 million refugees who have already fled the country.

The estimates from the International Organization for Migration suggests Ukraine is fast on a course in just three weeks toward the levels of displacement from Syria’s devastating war – which has driven about 13 million people from their homes both in the country and abroad.

The findings come in a paper issued Friday by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. It cited the IOM figures as “a good representation of the scale of internal displacement in Ukraine — calculated to stand at 6.48 million internally displaced persons in Ukraine as of March 16.”

WASHINGTON — There have been no indications that Russia is moving troops out of Syria to bolster its forces in Ukraine, or that any more than a few Syrian fighters have been recruited to join the war, the top U.S. commander for the Middle East said Friday.

Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie told reporters that he has seen little change in Russian military activities in Syria. And he added that the U.S. military still has and uses a deconfliction phone line with the Russians in Syria, in contrast to the mixed success the U.S. has had in maintaining such contact in connection with the Ukraine war.

“We can always contact them if we have a problem. They’ll always pick up the phone, and we feel that we respond in kind to them,” said McKenzie about the Russians, whose forces in Syria support the regime of President Bashar Assad. “That relationship has been very, very professional.”

McKenzie, who is retiring after three years at the head of U.S. Central Command, said he also has seen no indication that Russia is moving any troops or assets from Syria or central Asian countries such as Tajikistan, to Ukraine. And he said he also has seen no evidence that “the temperature is rising” between Russia and the U.S. in Syria as a result of the Ukraine war.

LONDON — Britain’s defense intelligence chief says Russia is shifting to a ”strategy of attrition” after failing to reach its goals in the invasion of Ukraine.

Chief of Defense Intelligence Lt. Gen. Jim Hockenhull says Russian forces have changed their approach after failing to take major Ukrainian cities during the three-week invasion.

He said Friday that the battle of attrition “will involve the reckless and indiscriminate use of firepower. This will result in increased civilian casualties, destruction of Ukrainian infrastructure and intensify the humanitarian crisis.”

Western officials say Russian forces have enough artillery ammunition to keep up the bombardments for weeks or even longer.

Despite the fact that there have been thousands of Ukrainian civilian casualties, Russia denies targeting civilians during what it calls a special military operation in Ukraine.

ROME — For the second time this week, Italy’s financial police have carried out measures to freeze luxurious assets of Russian magnates being sanctioned by the European Union for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The latest action on Friday involved the seaside villa, valued at some 105 million euros ($116 million) and located in the Sardinian town of Portisco, belonging to Alexei Mordaschov, a steel baron, the Italian government said.

Just a few days earlier, a sprawling real estate complex on Sardinia’s coast belonging to Petr Aven, a close associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was sequestered. A yacht moored off the Italian Riviera and belonging to Mordaschov was sequestered earlier this month by Italian authorities. That vessel is valued at 27 million euros ($30 million).

ATLANTA — NASA Administrator Bill Nelson on Friday played down recent comments by the head of Russia’s space agency that the United States would have to use broomsticks to fly to space after Russia said it would stop supplying rocket engines to U.S. companies.

“That’s just Dmitry Rogozin. He spouts off every now and then. But at the end of the day, he’s worked with us,” Nelson told The Associated Press. “The other people that work in the Russian civilian space program, they’re professional. They don’t miss a beat with us, American astronauts and American mission control.”

The war has resulted in canceled spacecraft launches and broken contracts, and many worry Rogozin is putting decades of a peaceful off-planet partnership at risk, most notably at the International Space Station.

NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei is due to leave the International Space Station with two Russians aboard a Soyuz capsule for a touchdown in Kazakhstan on March 30.

NASA has said Vande Hei’s homecoming plans remain unchanged.

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden and China’s Xi Jinping spoke Friday for nearly two hours via a video call as the White House looks to deter Beijing from providing military or economic assistance for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

China’s Foreign Ministry was the first to issue a readout of the conversation, deploring “conflict and confrontation” as “not in anyone’s interest,” without assigning any blame to Russia.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying in a Twitter message called the U.S. position “overbearing.”

Ahead of the call, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden would question Xi about Beijing’s “rhetorical support” of Putin and an “absence of denunciation” of Russia’s invasion.

LVIV, Ukraine — Satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press show the Russian strike on the Lviv airport Friday destroyed the repair hangar just to the west of the north end of its runway. Firetrucks stood parked amid the rubble.

A row of fighter jets near the hangar appeared intact, though an apparent impact crater sat right in front of them. Two other buildings nearby the hangar also appear to have taken direct hits in the strike, with debris littered around them.

The early morning attack on Lviv’s edge was the closest strike yet to the center of the city, which has become a crossroads for people fleeing from other parts of Ukraine and for others entering to deliver aid or fight. The war has swelled Lviv’s population by some 200,000.

BERLIN — Switzerland is adopting the latest round of European Union sanctions against Russia targeting luxury goods and banning rating agencies from working with Russian clients.

The Swiss government said Friday that it will echo the EU’s fourth package of sanctions imposed on Russia following its attack on Ukraine.

It said that “the ban on the export of luxury goods contained in the new sanctions affects only a small portion of Switzerland’s global exports of such goods.”

However, it said that “specific companies could be seriously affected,” without naming them.

Unlike the EU and the United States, Switzerland has not yet decided whether to remove Russia from its list of “most favored” trading partners.

MARIUPOL, Ukraine — Officials say 130 people have been rescued from the ruins of a theater that served as a shelter when it was blasted by a Russian airstrike Wednesday in the besieged southern city of Mariupol.

Ludmyla Denisova, the Ukrainian parliament’s human rights commissioner, said Friday that 130 people had survived the theater bombing.

“As of now, we know that 130 people have been evacuated, but according to our data, there are still more than 1,300 people in these basements, in this bomb shelter,” Denisova told Ukrainian television. “We pray that they will all be alive, but so far there is no information about them.”

ATHENS, Greece — Greece’s prime minister is offering to rebuild the maternity hospital in Mariupol that was bombed by Russian forces last week.

Kyriakos Mitsotakis tweeted Friday that “Greece is ready to rebuild the maternity hospital in Mariupol, the center of the Greek minority in Ukraine.”

Some 100,000 people of Greek origin were living in the besieged city before the Russian invasion.

Mitsotakis called Mariupol “a city dear to our hearts and symbol of the barbarity of the war.”

Associated Press journalists documented the attack and saw the victims and damage firsthand. They shot video and photos of several bloodstained, pregnant mothers fleeing the blown-out maternity ward as medical workers shouted and children cried.

COPENHAGEN, Denmark — The Finnish government has begun posting information in Russian about the invasion of Ukraine.

“We ... want to provide Russian speakers with fact-based information from the authorities,” the Finnish government tweeted Friday.

The move comes in the face of a Russian propaganda and disinformation campaign that aims to strengthen domestic support for the invasion and undermine the resolve of Ukrainians.

The website of the Finnish government is available in Finnish and Swedish — the Nordic country’s two official languages — and in English.

President Vladimir Putin appeared at a huge patriotic rally Friday at a Moscow stadium on the eighth anniversary of the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine.

Putin, speaking to a crowd of tens of thousands of people waving Russian flags at the Luzhniki Stadium, praised the Russian military for its actions in Ukraine.

“Shoulder to shoulder, they help and support each other,” Putin said in a rare public appearance. “We have not had unity like this for a long time,” he added to cheers from the crowd.

Before Putin spoke, bands played patriotic Soviet songs about national identity and speakers praised Putin as fighting “Nazism” in Ukraine, a claim flatly rejected by leaders across the globe.

Some people, including presenters at the event, wore T-shirts or jackets with a “Z” — a symbol seen on Russian tanks and military vehicles in Ukraine and embraced by supporters of the war.

ROME — Pope Francis has denounced the “perverse abuse of power” on display in Russia’s war in Ukraine. He is calling for aid to Ukrainians who he said had been attacked in their “identity, history and tradition” and were “defending their land.”

Francis’ comments, in a message Friday to a gathering of European Catholic representatives, marked some of his strongest yet in asserting Ukraine’s right to exist as a sovereign state and to defend itself against Russia’s invasion.

It came just days after Francis told the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, that the concept of a “just war” was obsolete since wars are never justifiable and that pastors must preach peace, not politics.
