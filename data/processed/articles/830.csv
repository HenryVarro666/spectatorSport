EU leaders have agreed to impose ""massive"" sanctions on Russia in areas ranging from finance to transport, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in the early hours of Friday.

Speaking following an emergency summit dedicated to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, von der Leyen declared that ""we will hold the Kremlin accountable.""

""The package of massive and targeted sanctions European leaders approved tonight clearly demonstrates that — it will have maximum impact on the Russian economy and the political elite,"" she said.

The new sanctions will hit five areas: the financial sector, the energy sector, the transport sector, export controls and visa policy, according to the Commission chief.

""This package includes financial sanctions that cut Russia's access to the most important capital markets. We're now targeting 70 percent of the Russian banking market, but also key state-owned companies including the field of defense,"" she said.

The sanctions will increase Russia's borrowing costs and gradually erode its industrial base, according to von der Leyen, who also said Russia's elites will be hit.

When it comes to energy, ""our export ban will hit the oil by making it impossible for Russia to upgrade its oil refineries.""

There will also be a ban on the sale of aircraft, spare parts and equipment to Russian airlines, and limit Russia's access to crucial technologies needed to build semiconductors and other advanced technologies, officials said.

And when it comes to visas, ""diplomats and related groups and business people will no longer have privileged access to the European Union,"" she said.

""Our unity is our strength,"" von der Leyen said. ""The Kremlin knows this and it has tried its best to divide us, but it has utterly failed. It has achieved exactly the opposite,” she said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Commission president said, ""is trying to subjugate a friendly European country and he's trying to redraw the maps of Europe by force. He must — and he will — fail.""

The detailed sanctions package is expected to be approved by EU ambassadors on Friday morning and is then rubber-stamped by foreign ministers in the afternoon.",https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-council-summit-sanctions-russia-ukraine-euco/

""We took a political decision to add an additional package of mass sanction which will be painful for the Russian regime,"" Michel said after the extraordinary EU Summit.

""We also discussed support for the Ukrainian people and state to mobilize financing capacity and humanitarian support,"" he added.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the new EU sanctions against Russia will hit 70 percent of the Russian banking sector, key state-run corporations and deprive Russia of access to modern technologies.

""First, this package includes financial sanctions that cut Russia's access to the most important capital markets. We are now targeting 70% of the Russian banking market. But also, key state-owned companies including in field of defense,"" von der Leyen said after the extraordinary EU Summit.



The European Council has agreed on further restrictive measures that will impose massive and severe consequences on Russia for its action in Ukraine.

""These sanctions cover the financial sector, the energy and transport sectors, dual-use goods as well as export control and export financing, visa policy, additional listings of Russian individuals and new listing criteria,"" the European Council statement read.

Amid Russia's ongoing military operation in Ukraine, a United Nations Security Council (UNSC) vote on a resolution has been listed on a UN schedule for Friday.

However, the proposal could be vetoed by Moscow, CNN reported.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday recognized Ukraine's breakaway regions - Donetsk and Luhansk - as independent entities. Later, Putin ordered special military operations ""to protect"" the people in the Donbas region.

The European Union expressed solidarity with Ukraine, he said, adding that ""the response given by the European Council was financial support, humanitarian aid"", in addition to ""a series of very harsh measures on Russia and a series Russian personalities, as well as from Belarus"".

""The European Union is not a military organisation and, as such, what we approved was to endorse a proposal by the European Commission"" for a second package of harsh sanctions ""that seek to hit in particular the financial sector, the energy sector, the transport sector, to curb Russian State enterprises’ capacity to secure international financing, as well as restrict visas for holders of diplomatic or service passports"", he said.

The Prime Minister also stated that several EU member states ""have been offering bilateral support to Ukraine, including military support by offering lethal and non-lethal material"".

Military deterrence

""NATO will surely offer response in deterrence and to ensure the defence of all NATO countries, especially those that border with Ukraine or are close to Ukraine borders"", at the extraordinary virtual meeting of NATO Heads of State and Government today.

NATO ""is a defence alliance"", whose ""duty is that of solidarity with all the Alliance member countries – Ukraine is not an Alliance member country"" and NATO cannot naturally operate beyond its own territory and without defending its members"", he claimed.

António Costa stated that ""Russia went from violating international law to war against a free and democratic country and therefore this is a war on a democratic state’s freedom of self-determination"".

""The European Council had the opportunity to hold a video conference with President Volodymyr Zelensky"", who reported what is happening in his country, ""clearly denying the version of this being a military mission focused on the separatist regions"", and that it is ""large-scale action on the whole of Ukrainian soil, namely its capital Kiev"", he said.

The Prime Minister underlined that ""if Russia continues"" with this attack, the EU ""will consider additional measures"". The European Council tasked the European Commission to study a third sanction package.

Refugees

The Prime Minister stated that Portugal ""drew attention that Europe should not repeat past situations of unpreparedness in humanitarian crises that are predictable in this case and, therefore, it should start preparing the mechanisms to take in"" Ukrainian refugees.

Portugal reiterated its full availability to ""share with all other member states"" the ""duty to assure everyone’s international protection"" and António Costa recalled that ""in the concrete case of Ukrainian people, Portugal has had a very positive experience with the Ukrainian community that has been living here for almost 20 years""

""The Minister of State, Economy and Digital Transition [Pedro Siza Vieira] and the Minister of Labour, Solidarity and Social Security [Ana Mendes Godinho] have been in contact with a large number of companies to identify jobs to offer"", he claimed.

Taking in refugees

Portugal is therefore in a condition to ""offer the data for the occupational profile suited to the different job opportunities, which luckily exist at this time, and which are, in fact, fundamental for the Portuguese economy’s recovery"".

António Costa said that Portugal advocates, as it did in the past ""on other refugees that the principle of European solidarity is to be upheld, that all member states must be available"", at the onset ""those which, due to their geographical location, for having a shared border, will naturally be the first to be requested for international protection"", ""in this specific case, it will most likely be Poland"".

Portugal will ensure ""visas are immediately granted to relatives, friends or acquaintances of Ukrainian residents in Portugal, who wish to reside in Portugal"" and the consulates and embassies ""in Ukraine and neighbouring countries"" have already been informed.

The military capabilities of these two nations are so imbalanced that Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky implored his Western allies overnight to do more than impose sanctions to get Russian troops off Ukrainian soil.

Here's how the two country's military capabilities stack up.

Defense spending

Just a look at the amount of money the two nations spend on defense gives an indication of the gap between the two. Ukraine spent $4.7 billion in 2021, just over a tenth of nuclear-armed Russia's $45.8 billion, according to ""The Military Balance"" report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), published last week.

While the Russian government launched a drive in 2008 to modernize its military, after a brief war with Georgia laid bare equipment shortfalls, Ukraine's weapons are still largely from the Soviet era. In its ambitions to join NATO, however, Ukraine has reorganized the structure of its armed forces, and has plans to re-equip its air force with Western combat aircraft by the mid-2030s. It also plans to improve its naval capability.

Manpower

Where Russia has 900,000 active personnel in its armed forces, and 2 million in reserve, Ukraine has 196,000 and 900,000 reservists. Ukraine on Wednesday began conscripting reservists aged 18-60, according to IISS.

In land forces alone, Russia has a twofold advantage, with 280,000 troops to Ukraine's 125,600. And its air force is nearly five times as strong, with 165,000 to Ukraine's 35,000.

But in terms of how many troops are in this particular operation, Yohann Michel, a research analyst who worked on the IISS report, said Russia had an estimated 200,000 personnel in and around Ukraine.

""That's including around 60 battle groups. The situation is evolving rapidly and that number could change, but it's very large, and that's important. It's one of the largest in eastern Europe that we've seen in years — in my lifetime,"" Michel told CNN.

""Ukrainian numbers are more difficult because everything they have is now mobilized and they have called in reservists.""

8,8821ac85-c85b-487f-9498-0beb8eca8813,[],2022-02-25 00:00:00,"Russia's expulsion from SWIFT, the widely-used system of financial transactions, is back on the table for a third round of EU sanctions, despite previous attempts to exclude it.

As Moscow continues its invasion of Ukraine, Western countries are coming under increasing pressure to come up with extreme measures that would force the Kremlin to agree to a ceasefire and stop the violence.

EU leaders have already approved two rounds of sanctions that target Russia's financial, energy and transport sectors, tighten export control, including semiconductors, and restrict visa issuance. The penalties also include travel bans and the freezing of assets of a President Putin's inner circle.

Together, the bloc aims to cripple at least 70% of Russia's banking system in order to cut off the funds needed to bankroll the invasion.

""Second wave of sanctions with massive and severe consequences politically agreed last night,"" said European Council President Charles Michel. ""Further package under urgent preparation.""

But the Kremlin appears undeterred by threats of sanctions, which the EU is imposing in coordination with the United States, the United Kingdom, Norway, Canada, Japan and Australia.

All eyes turn now to SWIFT, which is seen as a last-resort, dramatic measure to change Moscow's mind.

EU foreign affairs ministers flew to Brussels on Friday to finalise the new raft of sanctions and discuss a third sanctions package, in which the payment system is back on the table.

""Many countries want to go beyond what's being agreed today,"" Simon Coveney, Ireland’s Foreign Affairs Minister, told Euronews before heading to the ministerial meeting.

""I understand that there is already a third package of sanctions that includes the [SWIFT] system, which may well be passed in the next few days,"" he added.

From Paris, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire did not categorically rule it out.

""This is the very last resort, SWIFT, but this is one of the options that remains on the table,"" he told reporters.

The prime ministers of Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands have previously called on the EU to be more ambitious in its response and seriously consider Russia’s expulsion from SWIFT.

Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia are also believed to support the move, but Germany, Italy, Hungary and Cyprus have expressed their concern, Euronews understands.

EU sanctions have to be approved by unanimity and require the green-light from the 27 member states.

""It is a possibility some member states didn't think it would be wise to do it at this stage, but it's still distinctly on the table,"" Frans Timmermans, the European Commission's Vice-President, told Euronews.

""We should be very clear that we will not refrain from the harshest sanctions given what's happened: there's a war on in Europe.""

""Over the last few days, the sanctions have come to a level which is almost good enough to affect the calculus of Vladimir Putin.""

Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials continue to push for the bloc to turn words into action.

""BAN RUSSIA FROM SWIFT and kick it out of everywhere,"" Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign affairs minister, wrote on Twitter in an impassioned plea.

He later tweeted that Italy had ""assured"" him it will support the SWIFT ban.

What is SWIFT and why is it so important?

The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) is a high-security intermediary system that allows banks and institutions around the world to carry out financial transactions – that is, ordinary payments – among each other.

The system was founded in 1973 and is headquartered in La Hupe, Belgium. Today, SWIFT links more than 11,000 financial institutions in more than 200 counties and territories, making it an essential piece of our globalised, fast-paced economy.

Crucially, SWIFT is used by EU member states to pay for Russian gas and oil, two resources that represent the backbone of the Russian economy.

Since the EU is Russia’s number one energy client, many are now calling for the country’s expulsion from SWIFT in order to deprive Moscow of the much-needed funds to sustain the ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

""If Russia is no longer able to actively participate in the international financial system, that has a major impact,"" Fabian Zuleeg, Chief Executive at European Policy Centre (EPC), told Euronews.

""It makes it very difficult to run financial institutions within Russia and it cuts off, very effectively, from outside finance. So, I think this is a move that would have helped.""

Why is expelling Russia from SWIFT considered risky?

But the move is risky. A total expulsion from SWIFT would mean that virtually all EU-Russia trade would come to a sudden halt, disrupting a significant part of the bloc's economy.

Russia is the EU's fifth-largest trade partner: in 2020, total trade in goods between the two amounted to €174.3 billion, of which €79 million were EU exports, according to the European Commission.

If this enormous amount of money were to disappear overnight, member states would feel the pain in an instantaneous and painful way. Gas prices would skyrocket, sending consumer bills to impossible highs and forcing many factories to stop production altogether.

“[SWIFT] is always an option. But right now, that’s not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take,” said US President Joe Biden when asked about the possibility.

""If Russia is disconnected from SWIFT the economy will implode, it will be a catastrophe for the Russian economy. And if the major oligarchs are sanctioned, then Putin's own wealth would be wiped out, and would be completely inaccessible. And those are two very material things to Vladimir Putin,"" said financier Bill Browder, head of the Global Magnitsky Justice Campaign, named after his former lawyer who was murdered in a Russian jail.

""Does he [Putin] stop attacking Ukraine on the day that happens? Surely not. But does it put him in a position where everything that he's worked for, for the last 20 years, has been sacrificed, surely yes. And at that point we are then in a position where we have some leverage,"" Browder told Euronews.",https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2022/02/25/eu-to-consider-russia-s-expulsion-from-swift-in-third-sanctions-package
