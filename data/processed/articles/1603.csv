1,636c7aaa-e1ec-434e-b9d3-d8352fec12a1,['Rfe Rl'],,"Russia's Defense Ministry warned on April 15 that it will intensify attacks on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, after accusing Ukraine of targeting Russian border towns.

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

VERSAILLES, March 11 (Reuters) - The European Commission aims to double the EU's military aid to Ukraine and has proposed earmarking another 500 million euros for this purpose, the bloc's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Friday.

""Everybody was completely aware that we have to increase our military support to Ukraine,"" he told reporters as he arrived for the second day of a meeting of EU leaders in Versailles. ""I am sure the leaders will approve this money.""

The EU is also considering imposing more sanctions on Russian oligarchs and the Russian economy, Borrell added.

Deutsche Bank 'winding down' operations in Russia

Following a backlash, Germany's biggest lender Deutsche Bank said it would wind down its business in Russia.

""Like some international peers and in line with our legal and regulatory obligations, we are in the process of winding down our remaining business in Russia while we help our non-Russian multinational clients in reducing their operations,"" the bank said on Friday.

""There won't be any new business in Russia.""

Deutsche Bank had faced stinging criticism from some investors and politicians for its ongoing ties to Russia. It had said leaving would go against its values, despite other banks cutting off ties.

UK intelligence: Russian strikes targeted Lutsk, Ivano-Frankivsk

The British Ministry of Defence said Russian air and missile forces had conducted strikes in the past 24 hours against the cities of Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk in western Ukraine.

Lutsk Mayor Ihor Polishchuk said four servicemen were killed and another six were wounded.

US accuses Russia of using UN Security Council for 'disinformation'

US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Russia had requested a UN Security Council meeting to spread ""disinformation"" as part of a potential false-flag operation by Moscow for the use of chemical or biological agents in Ukraine.

Thomas-Greenfield said US Secretary of State Antony Blinken had warned that President Putin would ""fabricate allegations about chemical or biological weapons to justify its own violent attacks against the Ukrainian people.""

""The intent behind these lies seems clear, and is deeply troubling,"" she said. ""We believe Russia could use chemical or biological agents for assassinations, as part of a staged or false-flag incident, or to support tactical military operations.""

Russia's UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said Moscow had documents claiming that Ukraine has at least 30 biological laboratories carrying out ""very dangerous biological experiments"" involving pathogens, and its work ""is being done and funded and supervised by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency of the United States.""

US announces new sanctions against Kremlin elites, oligarchs

The US Department of Treasury imposed new sanctions on senior Kremlin officials and oligarchs, as well as their family members.

Those hit with sanctions include 10 people comprising VTB Bank's board and 12 members of the Duma.

""[The Department of] Treasury continues to hold Russian officials to account for enabling Putin's unjustified and unprovoked war,"" Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said in a statement.

""Today's actions also further isolates the severely damaged Russian economy by prohibiting trade in products that are key to the economic and financial interests of all Russian elites.""

Among the individuals targeted are three family members of Kremlin spokesman Dimitry Peskov, who the US name as ""the lead propagandist"" of Russia.

Separately, the US also announced sanctions against two Russian individuals and three entities over their support for North Korea's weapons program.

Ukraine says Russian forces abducted mayor of occupied city

According to Ukraine's Foreign Ministry, Russian forces have abducted the mayor of the city of Melitopol.

An unverified video posted on social media shows Mayor Ivan Fedorov being led away by armed men from a government building in the city.

Melitopol, a city in southeastern Ukraine, has been occupied for more than a week. Fedorov's fate is unknown.

""The abduction of the mayor of Melitopol is classified as a war crime under the Geneva Conventions and the Additional Protocol, which prohibit the taking of civilian hostages during the war,"" Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

Amnesty says its Russian website blocked, RSF says it has a workaround

Amnesty International's Russian-language website is among those blocked by country's media regulator, Roskomnadzor, it emerged on Friday.

""By blocking Amnesty's Russian-language site, along with those of many other human rights organizations, independent media outlets and social media platforms, the Kremlin is showing that it can't stomach the truth about the horror Russia has unleashed in Ukraine,"" Marie Struthers, Amnesty's Eastern Europe and Central Asia Director, said.

Amnesty said Russia was trying to ""suppress information about the possible war crimes its troops are committing in Ukraine"" with the shutdown.

Meanwhile, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said hackers and other specialists had created a mirror site for the Russian independent news website, Meduza, that Russia can't easily block.

The site is run out of Latvia by exiled Russian journalists.

RSF said it could do the same thing for other independent media outlets that Russia was blocking.

""Without strong action, the Russian Internet will soon complete its transformation into a propaganda network,"" RSF secretary-general Christophe Deloire said.

Europe to implement the fourth round of sanctions against Russia

The EU has joined the United States in revoking Russia's ""most-favored nation"" trade status. The World Trade Organization term is a little misleading, as almost all WTO members trade with each other under ""most-favored nation"" status.

The move would put Russia on par with North Korea and Iran.

""We will also work to suspend Russia's membership rights in leading multilateral financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said.

It is part of the fourth set of sanctions the bloc is implementing against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.

Other measures include a crackdown on Moscow's use of crypto-assets, a ban on exports of luxury goods to Russia, and preventing imports of iron and steel sector goods to the EU.

""This crisis is unprecedented. And so is the unity and speed of reaction our democracies have shown so far,"" von der Leyen said.

ICC opens online portal to gather war crime evidence

The International Criminal Court warned warring parties in Ukraine that attacks on civilians are a crime.

""If attacks are intentionally directed against the civilian population: that is a crime. If attacks are intentionally directed against civilian objects: that is a crime,"" ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan said in statement.

The court last week opened an investigation into the situation in Ukraine.

On Friday, it launched an online portal to gather evidence of war crimes.

""I encourage all those with relevant information to come forward and contact our Team through this platform,"" Kahn said.

It will be added to evidence gathered by an investigative team sent to the region last week.

Neither Russia nor Ukraine is a fully-fledged ICC member state.

UN Security Council session opens amid reciprocal 'false flag' allegations

A special session of the UN Security Council has opened, called by Russia, about Moscow's claims that US-backed laboratories in Ukraine were working on biological weapons and planning a ""false flag"" attack.

""There is no region in the world that can feel safe,"" Russia's Ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzya, said.

The UN's disarmament chief, Izumi Nakamitsu, however, told the council that the UN body was not aware of any biological weapons program in Ukraine.

The US in turn accused Russia of planning a biological or chemical weapons attack of its own that it would then seek to blame on the other side. It also said Russia was abusing the UN Security Council by using it as a vehicle to spread disinformation.

US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield went even further, saying ""Russia has a track record of falsely accusing other countries of the very violations that Russia itself is perpetrating.""

""We have serious concerns that Russia may be planning to use chemical or biological agents against the Ukrainian people,"" she said, without providing evidence.

Russian siege of Mariupol kills almost 1,600 civilians: local council

At least 1,582 civilians have been killed in Ukraine's southeastern city of Mariupol as a result of Russian shelling and a 12-day blockade, the city council said in an online statement, also saying: ""We will never forget and will never forgive this crime against humanity.""

Russia's Defense Ministry on Friday said that its offensive, led by fighters from the separatist-held Donetsk region, was further squeezing Mariupol, which lies on the Sea of Azov that runs into the Black Sea.

Repeated attempts over the past week to evacuate many of the city's 430,000 residents and deliver food and medicine have failed owing to violations of temporary cease-fires and other complications.

Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, described Mariupol as the ""worst humanitarian catastrophe on the planet."" He posted a picture showing a mass grave in the city on Twitter.

Residents have been sheltering underground without power, heat, water and enough food for several days and the Red Cross has described the situation as ""apocalyptic.""

There are growing concerns that Russia may repeat the same strategy of laying siege to Ukrainian cities as used in Syria.

Macron: Ukraine conflict threatens food security in Europe, Africa

French President Emmanuel Macron has warned that the war in Ukraine could ""deeply destabilize"" food supplies in Europe and Africa.

Speaking to reporters after the EU leaders' meeting near Paris, he warned that some of the world's most fertile agricultural land in Ukraine can't be planted right now because of Russia's invasion.

Macron's comments backed up a warning from the United Nations on Friday that millions of people could be threatened with malnutrition by next year if there are major cuts in the export of grain from major producers Ukraine and Russia.

The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimated that the number of undernourished people worldwide could rise by 8 million to 13 million by 2023 if the conflict in Ukraine continues for months.

Prices for wheat and corn, among other grains, have already risen sharply on world markets and Ukrainian farmers — who produced a record grain crop last year — say they are now short of fertilizer, pesticides and herbicides, and can't get enough fuel to power their equipment.

In a television address on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on farmers to keep up production to try to avoid shortages of produce.

The issue isn't limited to Ukraine, either. Farmers elsewhere are concerned about drastically higher prices for nitrogen fertilizer, the production of which requires natural gas.

Zelenskyy says Ukraine is fighting for more countries than itself

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy got a standing ovation from the Polish National Assembly. He spoke to the assembly via video link at an event marking the 23rd anniversary of Poland joining NATO.

Zelenskyy thanked Poland for its military support and for hosting Ukrainian refugees fleeing the Russian attacks, ""when there is someone that is brutal in its attack, you need someone you can count on.""

""We are fighting for the Baltic states and for Poland so that they don't have to face [Russia],"" he said.

At the same event, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance has more than doubled the number of troops and military equipment deployed in Poland, adding ""we will protect Poland.""

He again stressed Russia could not dictate who joins NATO.

""Neither Russia nor anyone else has a veto whether any country becomes a member,"" Stoltenberg said.

Polish President Andrzej Duda said it was essential to support Ukraine against Russia.

""What Russia is doing in Ukraine shows it is still the empire of evil,"" Duda said. ""We cannot allow Russia to overpower the free and independent Ukraine.""

Biden to revoke Russia's 'most favored nation' trade status

US President Joe Biden said Washington would revoke Russia's ""most favored nation"" trade status over its invasion of Ukraine. The phrase used by the World Trade Organization (WTO) is somewhat misleading, as it means countries reciprocally agree to trade with each other on the same terms as they do with other ""most favored nations."" The US extends this status to all countries in the WTO except those who have had the status suspended, as do most members.

In the US, this trade status is in fact referred to as ""Permanent Normal Trade Relations"" (PNTR). Removing it would require an act of Congress, but lawmakers in both houses — and on both sides of the political aisle — have already signaled their support.

The European Union and Group of Seven wealthy nations (G7) are expected to follow suit.

Biden said the United States would also cut imports of seafood, vodka and diamonds from Russia and would work with its international partners to stop Moscow to taking loans from global institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

Again ruling out any direct US military intervention in Ukraine, Biden said broadening the conflict to a clash between NATO and Russia could lead to ""World War III.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Twitter that he had spoken to Biden earlier Friday and had informed him about the “crimes of Russia against the civilian population."" He added that the pair had ""agreed on further steps to support the defense of Ukraine and increase sanctions against Russia.""

Russia carries out first air strikes on western Ukraine

Russia has widened its offensive in Ukraine, striking airfields in the west for the first time.

Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said Moscow used high-precision long-range weapons to put military airfields in Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk ""out of action.""

Russian air strikes also targeted for the first time the eastern city of Dnipro, a major industrial hub and Ukraine's fourth-largest city, on the river of the same name.

Until now, Russian forces have made the biggest advances on cities in the south and east while stalling in the north and around Kyiv.

But the advance had appeared to stall amid reports of food and fuel shortages and attacks by Ukrainian troops with anti-tank missiles.

New satellite photos also appeared to show the massive Russian convoy outside the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, had fanned out.

A 40-mile (64-kilometer) line of tanks and other vehicles had massed outside the city early last week. The Russian military is widely expected to try to encircle Kyiv.

Europe to double military aid for Ukraine

Europe has earmarked another €500 million ($550 million) for military aid to Ukraine, the President of the European Council Charles Michel said.

He spoke at the end of the meeting of EU leaders at Versailles in France.

The money will be on top of the €500 million the EU has already committed to support Ukraine.

At the same event, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Europe would impose a fourth round of sanctions on Russia and President Vladimir Putin soon.

She also said Ukraine's application for EU membership was being considered favorably, adding that the country is already ""a member of the European family.""

""Ukraine's membership application is an expression of their will and their right to choose their own destiny. Today we have opened the pathway towards us for Ukraine,"" she added.

French President Emmanuel Macron said the EU would hold an extraordinary summit by May to discuss joint defense investments in the block.

He said the EU wants to stop importing Russian gas, oil and coal by 2027.

""There have to be new investments and new facilities so that we can support our choices for renewables and nuclear energy,"" Macron said.

Macron said he and Scholz will speak again to Putin ""in a few hours.""

Scholz: Cutting Europe's reliance on Russian energy will take time

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz says Europe is working to reduce its reliance on Russian oil and gas in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But he acknowledged that it would take some time.

""Our situation is much different than the US or Canada, who are much less dependent on Russian oil and gas, because they are net exporters,"" Scholz told a news conference following a summit of EU leaders at Versailles in France on Friday.

""What they are doing, they know that Europe cannot do in the undertake in the same way"" he added, referring to the ban on Russian energy by the US and Canada.

One idea, he said, was to link up electricity and gas networks across Europe to be more efficient.

The German leader also said the Western sanctions on Moscow had been ""massive"" and were already having ""dramatic consequences"" on the Russian economy.

Scholz said the Western countries had shown a ""strong will to stand together, to stand shoulder to shoulder in managing this crisis.""

He added that other EU leaders had welcomed Berlin's decision to drastically hike military spending.

EU summit at Versailles wrapping up

The leaders of EU member states have concluded an informal summit held at France's Versailles Palace with talks centering around the situation in Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz are among the participants.

There has been strong support of Ukraine's resistance to Russia's invasion.

However, some have stressed that there is no shortcut to EU membership, which Ukraine is seeking as a matter of urgency. Former eastern bloc countries however believe there needs to be a stronger signal towards membership.

Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich hit with fresh sanctions, from Canada

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Friday that his country had imposed sanctions on Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich and four other oligarchs.

""These individuals will be prevented from dealings in Canada and their assets will be frozen,"" Trudeau told reporters in Warsaw.

He added that 32 Russian companies and government entities would be barred from receiving defense equipment or supplies from Canada.

However, the Canadian operations of Russian steelmaker Evraz, of which Abramovich is the largest shareholder, will not be affected by the move.

On Thursday, Abramovich — who owns Chelsea Football Club — was included in fresh UK sanctions against Russian individuals.

The football club is among the assets frozen and his planned sale of the club has been stalled.

Kremlin: Russian peace demands handed to Ukraine

Russia said Friday that its concrete demands for ceasing hostilities in Ukraine had been handed over to Kyiv.

The Interfax news agency cited Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that the demands were related to the advance of NATO infrastructure on Russia's western borders and Ukraine's actions in the southeastern Donbas region.

""For the resolution of these two issues, the concrete demands formulated by the Russian side were handed over to the Ukrainian side. As far as we know, the Ukrainians are discussing these demands with their advisers, primarily from the US and EU countries,"" Peskov said.

He added that a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy had not been ruled out.

""But first, both delegations and ministers must do their part to ensure that the presidents meet not for the sake of the process, not for the sake of talking, but for the sake of the result,"" Peskov said.

NATO chief: War must not escalate beyond Ukraine's borders

Russia's invasion of Ukraine must not spill over into an open conflict between NATO and Moscow, the military alliance's chief Jens Stoltenberg said.

""We have a responsibility to prevent this conflict from escalating beyond Ukraine's borders to becoming a full-fledged war between Russia and NATO,"" he told AFP news agency on the sidelines of a forum in Turkey.

Kyiv has strongly criticized NATO's refusal to declare a no-fly zone over Ukraine to stop Russian missiles and warplanes.

Last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the Western military alliance ruled out the measure despite knowing that further Russian aggression was likely.

In his interview with AFP, Stoltenberg warned that a no-fly zone would ""most likely lead to a full war,"" causing ""so much more suffering, so much more death and destruction.""

Moscow threatens Facebook over posts for calling for 'murder' of Russians

Russia said on Friday it would shut down Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp if the platforms allowed users to call for violence against Russians and death to President Vladimir Putin.

Internal emails seen by Reuters news agency showed Facebook's parent company Meta had temporarily allowed posts that call for the death of Putin or Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko.

A Meta spokesperson confirmed it had eased its rules, allowing posts such as ""death to the Russian invaders,"" although it would not allow calls for violence against Russian civilians.

Russia's Investigative Committee, which probes major crimes, said it was launching a criminal case into the report.

Russia's General Prosecutor's Office also requested that the internet giant be branded ""extremist.""

Zelenskyy: 'Strategic turning point' in war with Russia

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country has reached a strategic turning point in its war with Russia.

But he cautioned that time and patience were still needed until victory is achieved.

""It is impossible to say how many days we still have to free Ukrainian land,"" he said in a televised address. ""But we can say we will do it.""

Zelenskyy also urged the international community to step up their sanctions on Moscow.

UN: Credible reports of Russian use of cluster bombs

The United Nations human rights office said on Friday it had received ""credible reports"" of several cases of Russian forces using cluster bombs in Ukraine.

The munitions are made up of a hollow shell that explodes in mid-air, dispersing dozens or even hundreds of smaller ""bomblets"" over a wide area.

UNHCR spokesperson Liz Throssell said the use of cluster bombs in populated areas is ""incompatible with the international humanitarian law principles governing the conduct of hostilities.""

""We remind the Russian authorities that directing attacks against civilians and civilian objects, as well as so-called area bombardment in towns and villages and other forms of indiscriminate attacks, are prohibited under international law and may amount to war crimes.""

The UNHRC said it had confirmed at least 549 civilian deaths in Ukraine and 57 injuries since the Russian invasion began on February 24, although experts say the real figure is likely higher.

Russia is not a party to a 2008 convention banning cluster bombs, but the country is bound by international humanitarian law.

Minister proposes evacuating wounded to Germany

Germany should play a leading role in providing medical care for the victims of the war in Ukraine, Health Minister Karl Lauterbach said Friday.

""Wounded, injured people can be brought to Germany with the help of the International Red Cross and then be distributed throughout the country, he said.

Lauterbach said Germany can also deliver medicines and medical supplies to Ukraine, via Poland.

He also hailed reports that several German nurses and doctors have volunteered to work in Ukraine, describing their decision as a ""heroic effort.""

'Positive shifts' in Russia-Ukraine talks, Putin says

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday there had been some progress in talks with Ukraine, but provided no details.

""There are certain positive shifts, negotiators on our side tell me,"" Putin said in a meeting with his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko, adding that talks continued ""practically on a daily basis.""

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba had said Thursday the meeting in Turkey with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, did not bring any decisive progress.

Kuleba said they couldn't agree on the creation of humanitarian corridors for the port city of Mariupol, but that Lavrov would confer with colleagues in Moscow on the issue.

Interior Ministry: Most extremists fighters have returned to Germany

Most of the far-right extremists who left Germany to help Ukraine fight against Russia have returned, an Interior Ministry spokesperson said Friday.

The update followed a report by Bild newspaper last week that nearly 1,000 foreign fighters from Germany had traveled to Ukraine to join the international legion to fight the invasion. Among them were members of neo-Nazi groups, the report said.

Ukrainian President Zelenskyy had called on Ukrainians abroad or other interested parties to come to and help his country fight Russia.

The Interior Ministry spokesperson reiterated an earlier statement that the number was in the single digits, adding that Berlin authorities were able to stop others from leaving.

In Germany, there have been a small number of anti-Russian and anti-Ukrainian incidents. The ministry is monitoring the situation, added the spokesperson.

EU plans to double military aid financing to Ukraine

The European Union is proposing to spend an extra €500 million ($549 million) to finance military aid to Ukraine, the bloc's foreign policy chief said.

Josep Borrell said he was ""certain"" EU leaders meeting in France for a second day on Friday would agree to double the spending package that has seen the bloc fund weapons going to Ukraine.

The bloc last month broke a long-standing taboo by agreeingto pay for arms deliveries to Ukraine after Russia invaded its neighbor to the West.

The move by Brussels was part of a broad push by Ukraine's allies to send weapons after pleas from Kyiv to help it fight off the Kremlin's advancing forces.

Officials said the new tranche of money would go towards reimbursing EU nations that were unilaterally sending arms requested by Ukraine.

Nearly a million people in Ukraine are without electricity, the country's state-owned nuclear energy provider Energoatom said on Friday, as Russia's bombardment of Ukrainian cities continued.

It added that nearly 228,000 consumers were without natural gas.

Other reports have said the port city of Mariupol, where authorities have tried repeatedly to evacuate civilians, has been without food, running water and electricity for 10 days.

Nighttime temperatures in Ukraine regularly fall below freezing and daytime temperatures hover around 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit).

Deutsche Bank maintains operations in Russia

Deutsche Bank has been criticized for not joining other Western companies in leaving Russia following the invasion of Ukraine.

Bill Browder, an investor campaigning to expose corruption, said by continuing to do business in Russia, Germany's biggest bank ""is completely at odds with the international business community and will create backlash, lost reputation and business in the West.""

Ana Botin, president of the European Banking Federation, told Spain's El Mundo newspaper, ""Most European banks are applying the strictest sanctions and even going further, trying to do what is right and what needs to be done.""

Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing on Thursday defended the decision in a note to staff, saying leaving Russia would “go against our values.""

He added that it would not ""be the right thing to do in terms of managing those client relationships and helping them to manage their situation.""

Deutsche Bank said earlier this week its credit risk exposure to Russia and Ukraine was €2.9 billion ($3.18 billion) and that it had reduced its Russia exposure further over the past two weeks.

Two German public broadcasters resume operations in Moscow

A week after they announced they would suspend operations in Russia, German public broadcasters ARD and ZDF have said they will resume broadcasts from Moscow.

The broadcasters said they will report on the ""political, economic and social situation in Russia,"" WDR, a member of the ARD network, said.

The decision to halt broadcasting came after the Russian State Duma passed a law criminalizing ""false reporting"" of its armed forces with up to 15 years in jail

Unlike Deutsche Welle, which is also a public broadcaster, the two other German networks' journalists did not have their press accreditation revoked by Russian authorities.

Litvinenko's widow: West must counter Putin's 'brainwashing'

The West must step up its battle against the Kremlin's disinformation campaign, Marina Litvinenko, the widow of the poisoned Russian spy and Putin critic Alexander Litvinenko, told DW.

She said the Russian people have been ""completely brainwashed"" over the past 20 years and most independent media outlets have been shut down.

Litvinenko said Western countries — including Germany — who used to beam Russian language broadcasts into the Soviet Union, were partly responsible for allowing Russian President Vladimir Putin to spread disinformation when they cut their services after the end of the Cold War.

""It was a huge mistake because the people behind this war have been waiting for revenge. When this all proper [truthful] information left Russia, it was ... [replaced] by disinformation, by brainwashing,"" she added.

""Stop working, go outside on the street … against this war. [Putin] is not only destroying Ukraine, he's not only destroying West, he destroyed his own country. In two weeks, the Russian economy has completely collapsed.""

UN: 4.5 million displaced by Russian invasion

The International Organization for Migration (IOM) says 2.5 million people have now fled Ukraine since Russia invaded 15 days ago.

IOM spokesman Paul Dillon said the figures, taken from national governments, were up to date until Friday morning (GMT).

Dillon said more than 1.5 million refugees have gone to Poland and that around 116,000 of those who've fled Ukraine are ""third-country nationals,"" not Ukrainians.

The UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, also gave the 2.5 million figure for refugees and said his agency estimates that about 2 million people are also displaced inside Ukraine.

Putin calls on 'volunteers' to join Russia's offensive

Russian President Vladimir Putin has backed plans to let volunteers from countries fight in Ukraine as the conflict there enters its third week.

Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Russia knew of ""more than 16,000 applications"" from the Middle East, many of them from people who he said helped Russia against the ""Islamic State"" group, according to a Kremlin transcript.

They want ""to take part in what they consider a liberation movement,"" Shoigu said, on the side of Russia-backed separatist regions in eastern Ukraine.

Scholars have cast doubt on the Kremlin's motives, particularly the notion that Moscow maintains it is liberating Ukraine. University of Rochester's associate professor of history Matthew Lenoe called Russia's invasion of its neighbor ""a brutal act of aggression with absolutely no justification.""

Navalny repeats protest call to stop 'maniac Putin'

Jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny called for anti-war protests to take place across Russia on Sunday.

""Mad maniac Putin will most quickly be stopped by the people of Russia now if they oppose the war,"" Navalny posted on Instagram.

""You need to go to anti-war rallies every weekend, even if it seems that everyone has either left or got scared,"" he said. ""You are the backbone of the movement against war and death.""

Potential Chelsea buyers must approach UK government

Anyone interested in buying Premier League soccer club Chelsea must first approach the UK government and make a proposal.

The British government sanctioned owner Roman Abramovich and halted his planned sale of the club, as well as a raft of restrictions on the club, such as limits on travel expenditure and an inability to buy players.

""As the license conditions are written today, the sale would not be allowed,"" Britain's technology minister Chris Philp told Sky News.

""If a buyer emerged it would be open to that buyer or to that football club to approach the government and ask for the conditions to be varied in a way that allows that sale to take place.""

The sanctions on Abramovich, which froze all his UK assets over his ""clear"" links to Russian President Vladimir Putin, brought a halt to plans that he had of selling the club in the wake of the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine.

Separately, London-listed Russian steelmaker Evraz, in which Abramovich is the largest shareholder according to Refinitiv Eikon, said on Friday its entire board had quit.

Meanwhile, German coach Thomas Tuchel insisted it was ""business as usual"" as Chelsea played their Premier League match against Norwich City just hours after the UK government announced the strict measures on the London club's Russian owner.

Food export markets 'must remain open' says German minister

Global food markets must stay open without export restrictions to ensure supplies to poor countries in particular, German Agriculture Minister Cem Özdemir said.

The war in Ukraine has caused surging food prices amid tight supplies as a growing list of key producing countries seeking to keep vital food supplies within their borders. But Özdemir told German television ZDF: ""Markets must remain open.""

""We must ensure that the grain that is available is available fairly at affordable prices,"" he added as wheat prices hit a 14-year high with no end in sight to the conflict.

Russia and Ukraine provide nearly 30% of all global wheat exports.

Ukraine will no longer buy Russian nuclear fuel

Ukraine's state-owned nuclear power firm Energoatom will no longer buy Russian nuclear fuel, Reuters news agency reported the company as saying.

The country operates nuclear reactors from the Soviet era and imports its fuel from Russia and the United States.

Last week, Europe's largest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine, was caught in the crossfire after fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces caused a fire at the power station.

While no radiation leaks were detected and staff continue to work on the site, the incident sparked fears of a possible nuclear disaster among global leaders.

Air Astana and Pegasus Airlines suspend flights to Russia

Kazakhstan's national airline Air Astana and Turkey's Pegasus Airlines said Friday they were temporarily suspending flights to Russia.

The Kazakh airline tweeted: ""Air Astana sincerely regrets to advise that due the withdrawal of insurance coverage for commercial flights to, from and over the Russian Federation, all flights to the Russian Federation are suspended with immediate effect."" In a statement, Air Astana said it hoped to ""restore flights as soon as possible.""

Turkish budget airline Pegasus Airlines said that its flights to Russia will be suspended from March 13 to 27.

Pegasus said the decision to halt flights was brought about by ""operational risks"" from the sanctions imposed by the European Union.

Russia to declare cease-fire, open evacuation corridors

Russia's Defense Ministry will announce a partial cease-fire on Friday, enabling an opening of routes for the evacuation of Ukrainian citizens from five cities, according to the RIA and Interfax news agencies.

The agencies quoted the ministry as saying people could travel to Russia or other cities in Ukraine.

""From 10:00 am Moscow time (0700 GMT/UTC) on March 11, 2022, the Russian Federation will declare a 'regime of silence' and is ready to provide humanitarian corridors,"" Interfax reported, citing a statement.

The five cities are Kyiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Mariupol and Chernihiv.

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said she hopes the route for the besieged city of Mariupol will be successfully opened. Previous attempts to open such a corridor came under fire by Russian forces, Ukrainian officials said.

Vereshchuk added that buses would be sent to multiple Kyiv suburbs to bring people to the capital, and to bring aid to those staying behind.

Civilian targets shelled in Dnipro, Lutsk

Civilian targets came under Russian shelling in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, killing one, emergency services said.

It appeared to be the first direct attack on the city.

Emergency services said three airstrikes hit a kindergarten, an apartment building and a shoe factory.

Shelling was also reported Friday near the airport in Lutsk, a city in north-western Ukraine, the mayor wrote on Facebook.

Russia's Defense Ministry said its troops targeted airports in Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk, another western Ukrainian city some 250 kilometers (155 miles) south of Lutsk.

Orban: EU will not impose sanctions on Russian gas or oil

The European Union will not impose sanctions on Russian gas or oil, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Friday.

""The most important issue for us has been settled in a favorable way: there won't be sanctions that would apply to gas or oil, so Hungary's energy supply is secure in the upcoming period,"" Orban said in a video posted on his Facebook page.

Orban's comments came as EU leaders gathered in France to discuss ways of helping Ukraine.

The United Nations has estimated that 2.2 million people have fled the fighting since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine.

Facebook allows posts calling for violence against Russian soldiers, Putin

Meta Platforms will allow Facebook and Instagram users in some countries to call for violence against Russian troops, Reuters reported Friday. It represents a temporary shift in Meta's hate speech policy.

The social media giant is also temporarily allowing some posts that call for the death of Russian President Vladimir Putin or Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.

A Meta statement on the issue read: ""As a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we have temporarily made allowances for forms of political expression that would normally violate our rules like violent speech such as 'death to the Russian invaders.' We still won't allow credible calls for violence against Russian civilians.""

The Russian Embassy in the United States demanded that Washington stop Meta's ""extremist activities,"" Reuters news agency reported.

""Users of Facebook & Instagram did not give the owners of these platforms the right to determine the criteria of truth and pit nations against each other,"" the embassy said on Twitter.

Russian officials later said Meta would be shut down in Russia if it allowed calls for Putin's death.

US and allies plan to cut Russia's trade status

US President Joe Biden is expected to call for an end of normal trade relations with Russia later on Friday.

Despite the tense relationship between Washington and Moscow, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the US currently still affords ""most favored nation status"" to Russia.

The designation means that a country with the clause must give the same concessions, privileges, or immunities to nations with it as to any other World Trade Organization member.

Removing the special status from Russia would allow the US and allies to impose tariffs on Russian imports, increasing the isolation of the Russian economy in retaliation for the invasion.

The move is expected to be coordinated with other G7 allies, including the UK.

In the US, removing Russia's ""Permanent Normal Trade Relations"" (PNTR) status will require an act of Congress.

However, lawmakers in both houses of Congress — and on both sides of the aisle — have already signaled their support, officials say.

US passes bill for $14 billion to Ukraine

US lawmakers have passed a huge spending bill that includes almost $14 billion (about €12.7 billion) in humanitarian and military aid for Ukraine.

The money for Kyiv, which piggybacked on wider spending legislation, had support from both Democrats and Republicans who have both rallied behind sending aid to the country.

""We're keeping our promise to support Ukraine as they fight for their lives against the evil Vladimir Putin,"" Chuck Schumer, the leader of the Senate Democrats, said in a statement.

The emergency aid was said to be more than double what US President Joe Biden's administration had originally requested.

The House of Representatives had passed the bill a day earlier, with the bill now heading to Biden's desk. The aid package is certain to be signed into law by the US president.

Around half the money is for arming and equipping Ukraine and for the Pentagon's costs for sending US troops to Ukraine's next-door neighbors.

Much of the remaining sum includes humanitarian and economic help, protecting energy supplies, and cybersecurity.

UN Security Council to meet at Russia's behest

The US Security Council is set to meet later on Friday to discuss Russia's claims about alleged US ""military biological activities"" in Ukraine.

The allegations were made earlier this week, without evidence, by Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova.

Washington has responded, saying the claim was ""exactly the kind of false flag effort we have warned Russia might initiate to justify a biological or chemical weapons attack.""

That statement suggested Russia might seek to create a pretext for further escalating the two-week-old conflict that has seen the Russian offensive slowed, but not stopped, by Ukraine's troops.

""We're not going to let Russia gaslight the world or use the UN Security Council as a venue for promoting their disinformation,"" Olivia Dalton, spokesperson for the US Mission to the United Nations said late Thursday.

For years, the international community for years has assessed that Russia has used chemical weapons in carrying out assassination attempts against opponents of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Russia also backs Syria's Bashar al-Assad, whose regime has used chemical weapons against its people in an 11-year-long civil war.

Satellite pics show Kyiv-bound convoy dispersal

Satellite images appear to show a huge Russian convoy, mired outside the Ukrainian capital since last week, has broken up and redeployed.

The pictures from Maxar Technologies showed the 40-mile (64-kilometer) line of vehicles, including tanks and artillery, has dispersed.

Armored units have been seen in towns near the Antonov Airport north of the city and some have moved into forests, Maxar reported.

The convoy's advance on Kyiv appeared to have stalled last week amid reports of food and fuel shortages.

According to US officials, Ukrainian troops also targeted the line of hardware with anti-tank missiles.

Convoy elements appear to have deployed further north of the airport near the town of Lubyanka, with towed artillery howitzers in firing positions.

Summary of events in Ukraine-Russia crisis on Thursday

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said nearly half of the capital's residents had fled and the city had been turned into a fortress on Thursday.

Russian troops have taken over the outskirts in the north and northwest of the city. But the former boxing champion Klitschko said the city was determined not to fall.

""Every street, every building, every checkpoint has been fortified,"" he said in a televised address. ""Even people who in their lives never intended to change their clothes, now they are in uniform with machine guns in their hands.""

Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused Russian forces of targeting a humanitarian corridor in the city of Mariupol in an operation of ""outright terror.""

Zelenskyy said that, while some 100,000 people have been evacuated from the country's cities in just two days, some city residents have no way out.

The president said he had decided to send a convoy of trucks with food, water and medicine, but that ""the occupiers launched a tank attack exactly where this corridor was supposed to be.""

After international condemnation of a Russian strike on a hospital in Mariupol, Russia's Defense Ministry later denied hitting the building.

More than 2.3 million people have fled Ukraine so far, according to the latest UN tally, around half of them children.

In a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron called for a halt to military action in Ukraine.

However, Ukraine and Russia made ""no progress"" toward agreeing on a 24-hour cease-fire after talks in Turkey. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba had been meeting Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

""It seems that there are other decision-makers for this matter in Russia,"" Kuleba said, in a thinly veiled reference to Putin.

Putin on Thursday said his compatriots would find a way to ""adapt"" to the massive international sanctions and withdrawals of Western corporations in response to the invasion of Ukraine.

Members of Putin's inner circle hit by Western sanctions Roman Abramovich Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich is one of the latest billionaires to be blacklisted. Last week, he put the club up for sale and promised to donate money from the proceeds to help war victims in Ukraine. But the UK government thwarted his plans by freezing his assets on March 10. In 2008, Abramovich's net worth peaked at $23.5 billion, making him Russia's richest man.

Members of Putin's inner circle hit by Western sanctions Igor Sechin Sechin is the former deputy prime minister of Russia and the CEO of state oil company Rosneft. The EU sanctions document describes him as one of Putin’s ""closest advisers, and his personal friend."" It added that Sechin supports the consolidation of the illegally-annexed Crimea into Russia, noting Rosneft's involvement in delivering fuel to an airport on the peninsula.

Members of Putin's inner circle hit by Western sanctions Alisher Usmanov Born in Uzbekistan, Usmanov is a metals and telecoms tycoon. The EU cited him as one of Putin's favorite oligarchs, and said he paid millions to one of his key advisers, and hosted Putin in his personal luxury residence. He also ""fronted for President Putin and solved his business problems,"" the EU alleged. The United States and the United Kingdom added him to their blacklist on Wednesday.

Members of Putin's inner circle hit by Western sanctions Mikhail Fridman and Petr Aven The EU has described Fridman as ""a top Russian financier and enabler of Putin's inner circle."" He and his long-term partner, Petr Aven (seen left in the picture), have earned billions of dollars from oil, banking and retail, according to the Reuters news agency. Aven, the EU document said, is one of the wealthy Russian businessmen who regularly meet with Putin at the Kremlin.

Members of Putin's inner circle hit by Western sanctions Reject ties with Putin, Kremlin Fridman (center) and Aven both rejected any ""financial or political relationship with President Putin or the Kremlin"" in a press conference Tuesday, adding that they would contest the unfounded basis for the imposition of the sanctions ""through all means available to them."" Born in western Ukraine, Fridman is among the few sanctioned Russians who have publicly spoken against the war.

Members of Putin's inner circle hit by Western sanctions Boris and Igor Rotenberg The Rotenberg family is known for its close ties with Putin. Boris is the co-owner of SMP Bank, linked to the energy firm Gazprom. Older brother Arkady, who is already under EU and US sanctions, has practiced judo with Putin since they were both teenagers. Igor, Arkady's son, controls the drilling company Gazprom Bureniye. Boris and Igor were blacklisted by the UK and US on March 2.

Members of Putin's inner circle hit by Western sanctions Gennady Timchenko Timchenko is a major shareholder of Rossiya Bank which, according to the EU sanctions document, is considered the personal bank of senior Russian officials. The bank has invested in television stations that actively support the Russian government's policies destabilizing Ukraine. Rossiya Bank has also opened branches in Crimea, supporting its illegal annexation, the EU said.

Members of Putin's inner circle hit by Western sanctions Alexei Mordashov Mordashov has heavily invested in National Media Group, the largest private media holding in Russia, which supports the state's policies of destabilizing Ukraine, the EU alleged. In a statement, the billionaire replied he had ""nothing to do with the emergence of the current geopolitical tension,"" while calling the war a ""tragedy of two fraternal peoples.""

Members of Putin's inner circle hit by Western sanctions Confiscated yachts The new sanctions include asset freezes and travel restrictions. In recent days, several luxury yachts belonging to Russia's elite have been seized in Italy, France and the United Kingdom.

Brief History of the European Union

The European Union’s aim back in the days was to end the frequent bloody wars between neighbour states that culminated in the Second World War.

In 1950, the European Coal and Steel Community began the uniting of European countries economically and politically to gain lasting peace. In 1957, the Treaty of Rome created the European Economic Community (EEC) or the ‘Common Market’.

This brought a good period for the economy, as the EU countries stopped charging customs duties when trading with each other.

In 1973, Denmark, Ireland, and the United Kingdom formally decided to join the European Union, becoming nine member states altogether.

Later, in 1986 the Single European Act was signed, which also created the ‘Single Market’.

In 1993, the ‘Single Market’ was completed with the four freedoms:

Movement of goods

Movement of services

Movement of people

Movement of money

The 1990s were also a decade of treaties: the ‘Maastricht’ Treaty on the European Union in 1993 and the treaty of Amsterdam in 1999.

In 1995, the EU further enlarged with three more members joining: Austria, Finland, and Sweden.

During the 1990s, a small village in Luxembourg gave its name to the ‘Schengen’ agreements that would gradually allow people to travel without having their passports checked at the borders within the area.

In the 2000s, the euro became the new currency for many Europeans, and during the following decade, more countries adopted the euro (€).

The political divisions, during the 2000s, between the east and west Europe finally healed and 10 more new countries joined the EU in 2004, followed by Bulgaria and Romania which joined in 2007.

In 2008, a financial crisis hits the global economy. Therefore, the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force in 2009, providing the EU with modern institutions and more efficient working methods.

In 2013, Croatia became the 28th member to enter the EU.

In June 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum, letting the people decide whether they want to leave or remain in the European Union, after a few years of political debate on the topic. 33,577,342 people participated in the referendum, a turnout of 72.2%. The referendum resulted in 52% opting to leave while 48% remaining.

On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom officially left the European Union, starting the 11-month transition period.

Presently the increase of religious extremism in the Middle East, as well as in various other countries and regions around the world, has led to wars and turmoil, which has pushed many people to flee their home countries and seek refuge in Europe. The EU has recently found itself as the target of several terrorist attacks while facing the dilemma of how to take care of the refugees.

Which European countries are not part of the EU?

Currently, 23 countries located in the continent of Europe, are not part of the European Union.

However, five of them are in the process of integrating the EU legislation into national law, while two others are potential candidates, which have yet not fulfilled all the requirements for EU membership.

What is the difference between Schengen countries and EU countries

EU countries and Schengen countries are both European countries.

EU countries are those European countries that are a part of the European Union and have signed the treaties of the European Union. EU countries have to maintain their own national military and foreign policies but are bound to the judicial and legislative institutions of the EU.

Schengen countries are those European countries that have signed the Schengen Agreement. These countries operate as a single state with no border controls required when travelling within the countries but have the same international border control rules.

What is The European Economic Area (EEA)?

The EEA includes all EU countries and also Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.

What is EFTA?

EFTA stands for the European Free Trade Association. It is a regional trade organization and free trade area consisting of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. None of these countries are part of the European Union, but aside from Switzerland, others are all part of the European Economic Area.

Its free trade agreements foresee the elimination of import duties on industrial goods and fish. In addition, the EFTA States have added substantive rules and commitments on services, investment and/or public procurement to the agreements as a response to globalization.",https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/countries-in-europe/eu-countries/
5,636c7aaa-e1ec-434e-b9d3-d8352fec12a1,"['Abc News', 'Lorne Cook Associated Press', 'March']",,"Around 2.5 million people have fled Ukraine in the two weeks since Russia invaded

BRUSSELS -- In the two weeks since Russia invaded Ukraine, around 2.5 million people have fled — the great majority of them to European Union countries. More than half have entered Poland while hundreds of thousands more are seeking refuge, mostly in Hungary, Romania and Slovakia.

Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to launch an unprovoked war has been met with an outpouring of goodwill in Europe. The EU has launched an emergency protection system offering shelter, access to jobs, medical treatment and education to those who fled the assault.

The protection system streamlines entry procedures. It was established in 2001, in response to the fallout from the wars in former Yugoslavia and Kosovo in the 1990s, when thousands were forced from their homes. It has never been used before, despite the arrival of well over 1 million people in Europe in 2015, many fleeing conflict in Syria.

The “Temporary Protection Directive” sets out minimum standards across the EU's 27 countries for helping those in need. Member nations can provide more favorable conditions if they want. It also eases procedures for countries to transfer refugees between them if those people agree to move.

The following is a short guide to the new rules, what they mean for Ukrainians seeking shelter in Europe and for those who might want to help them.

WHO IS ELIGIBLE?

The decision applies to all Ukrainian nationals who have been displaced from Ukraine on or after Feb. 24, 2022 “as a result of the military invasion by Russian armed forces that began on that date.”

It also applies to their family members — spouses, unmarried partners in stable relationships and children — or to people who were already refugees inside Ukraine before the war. It excludes those who were living in Ukraine short-term, like foreign students.

HOW LONG CAN REFUGEES FROM UKRAINE STAY?

Ukrainian nationals are allowed to travel visa-free in Europe and so can move around once they are admitted for a 90-day period.

This means they can choose the EU country that would like to stay in and apply for temporary protection there. It’s particularly good for those who want to stay with relatives already in Europe.

That period of protection would apply for one year, initially. Unless it ends, the stay could be extended in six-month periods for a further year. If Ukraine remains unsafe, the EU’s executive branch, the European Commission, could extend the protection system for one more year, making a maximum of a three-year stay possible under certain circumstances.

Member states should try to help people return voluntarily when their stay is over. In some cases, they could help set up exploratory visits to help people work out whether it’s safe to go home. People can also apply for asylum in the EU at any time during their stay.

WHAT ARE PEOPLE ENTITLED TO?

Some countries are already providing free rail and bus travel, and other benefits to people fleeing Ukraine.

Some are lodged in reception centers or with willing European families. But under this system, European governments should ensure that people have access to accommodation or help to get housing.

They should receive social welfare benefits and possibly medical care. Countries should allow people to apply for jobs or become self-employed workers. Adult education, training in a trade or workplace experience should also be possible. People under 18 should be given access to schools.

Children traveling alone would be placed with adult relatives, foster families, reception facilities adapted to receiving minors, or with the adults they fled Ukraine with. Any visas should be provided free of cost.

Russia has asked China for military assistance in Ukraine, a senior US official said, and the Ukrainian military has thwarted an attempt by Russian military vehicles to cross the Irpin River.

It comes after a day that saw Russia expanding its offensive to western Ukraine, firing missiles near the city of Lviv and hitting a large military base close to the Polish border, reportedly killing dozens of people as the war draws closer to NATO's front line.

If you're just reading in, here are the latest headlines from the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Seeking China's help: Russia has asked China for military assistance in Ukraine, including drones, a senior US official said Sunday. White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the development is a “concern"" and the US has made it clear to Beijing there will ""absolutely be consequences"" for ""large-scale"" efforts to give the Kremlin a workaround to US sanctions. Sullivan will meet Chinese counterparts in Rome on Monday for talks.

When asked by CNN about the reporting of Russia's request for military aid, Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in the US, said in a statement, ""I've never heard of that.""

Chernobyl staff: Staff at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant are so tired they have stopped carrying out the repair and maintenance of safety-related equipment, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said. The 211 technical personnel and guards have still not been able to rotate from the facility since Russian forces entered the site. Ukraine managed to resume the power supply at Chernobyl on Sunday.

Russian forces thwarted: Ukrainian troops stopped an attempt by Russian military vehicles to cross the Irpin River on a pontoon bridge near Hostomel, new satellite images show. Ukrainian forces in Irpin have so far repelled Russian advances toward the capital Kyiv. With the main bridge crossing the Irpin River having been destroyed, the Irpin River poses a significant obstacle for the Russian military.

Ukraine cut off: Britain's Ministry of Defense said Russian forces have blockaded Ukraine’s Black Sea coast, cutting the nation off from international maritime trade.

Zelensky warning to NATO: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said it is only a matter of time before Russia’s military assault on Ukraine expands to members of NATO unless the alliance installs a no-fly zone over his country. It comes as Russian forces fired missiles near the city of Lviv and hit a large military base close to the Polish border.

Through a joint statement issued yesterday, on March 11, the Leaders of Group Seven (G7) said that they stand with the Ukrainian people and government who are heroically resisting the war of choice against their sovereign nation.

“We are united in our determination to hold President Putin and his regime accountable for this unjustified and unprovoked war that has already isolated Russia in the world. The world should join together in calling on President Putin and his regime to immediately stop its ongoing assault against Ukraine and withdraw its military forces. We stand in solidarity with those who are bravely opposing the invasion of Ukraine,” a part of the G7 leaders’ statement reads.

Nonetheless, even though the G7 leaders have fully backed the resistance of Ukraine against Russia, they have stressed once again that it is impossible for Ukraine to join the bloc through a speedy path, SchengenVisaInfo.com reports.

During the talks that took place on Thursday, March 10, the Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte, said that there is no such thing as a fast track while emphasising that Ukraine’s accession into the EU “is something for the long-term.”

Only a day after, the leaders came out with a joint statement and said that the Council of the European Union had invited the Commission of the European Union to provide an opinion regarding Ukraine’s application for EU membership. At the same time, the leaders emphasised that they would deepen their partnership to support Ukraine in joining the EU.

The G7 leaders also touched on other related topics during the summit. Through the same joint statement, the leaders highlighted that they would continue to introduce and implement restrictive measures against persons and entities who have significant economic roles in supporting Putin’s regime.

“We commit to continuing our campaign of pressure against Russian elites, proxies and oligarchs close to President Putin and other architects of the war as well as their families and their enablers,” the leaders added.

As for Ukraine, the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell, said upon his arrival at the EU leaders’ meeting in Versailles that they will increase their contribution to the military support.

“We are going to increase with another €500 million our contribution to the military support to Ukraine. Yesterday I proposed this to the Leaders. And the European Peace Facility will double its support with an additional €500 million more,” Borrell said.

The EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said the 27 officials taking part at two-day summit outside Paris will agree to inject an extra €500 million euros into the fund for military aid to Ukraine, as Russia widens its military offensive.

On Friday, Russia struck near airports in the west of the country for the first time as troops kept up pressure on the capital, Kyiv.

“I made the proposal to double our contribution,” Borrell said. “This is what we are going to do, and I am sure that the leaders will approve it this morning. And it is going to be done immediately. Now it flows quickly.”

The EU had previously agreed to spend 450 million euros ($500 million) on military supplies for Ukrainian forces in an unprecedented step of collectively supplying weapons to a country under attack.

Since the war started last month, the EU has adopted massive sanctions targeting Russian president Vladimir Putin, Russia’s financial system and its high-maintenance oligarchs. Earlier this week, the bloc’s nations agreed to slap further sanctions on 160 individuals and added new restrictions on the export of maritime navigation and radio communication technology.

They also decided to exclude three Belarusian banks from SWIFT, the dominant system for global financial transactions. Altogether, EU restrictive measures now apply to a total of 862 individuals and 53 entities.

Borrell said the EU will continue elaborating new sanctions targeting oligarchs and Russia’s economy.

According to an EU official with direct knowledge of the talks at the Versailles Palace, the idea is to have sanctions ready that can be activated if Putin’s war escalates further. The person was not authorized to speak publicly because of the sensitivity of discussions,

Possible new sanctions against Russia and its ally Belarus could include cutting all their banks from SWIFT, but a total embargo on fossil fuels imports from Russia similar to the one imposed by Washington is not on the table for now.

“We should be able to define the financial sanctions in a wider context. Some banks have been cut from SWIFT and we could add some,” Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said. “We should have some strategic patience. A few weeks, to see how they bite. At a certain point, it will weaken Russia.”

Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel said threatening Russia with the specter of new sanctions should be used to obtain a cease-fire.

“We need to apply high pressure and be successful,” he said.

Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden is set to announce Friday that, along with the European Union and the Group of Seven countries, the U.S. will move to revoke “most favored nation” trade status for Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.

According to a source familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the announcement, each country would have to follow its own national processes. Stripping most favored nation status from Russia would allow the U.S. and allies to impose tariffs on Russian imports, increasing the isolation of the Russian economy in retaliation for the invasion.

European Union leaders are backing Ukraine's bid for membership — but through the traditional process that takes years, not the fast-tracked version that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been pushing.

The European Council condemned Russia's military aggression and reiterated its support for Ukraine in a statement issued Thursday, halfway through a two-day summit at France's Palace of Versailles.

In response to Zelenskyy's formal application for membership, which he submitted on Feb. 28, officials said that ""Ukraine belongs to our European family"" but stopped short of extending an immediate welcome.

""The Council has acted swiftly and invited the Commission to submit its opinion on this application in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Treaties,"" it wrote. ""Pending this and without delay, we will further strengthen our bonds and deepen our partnership to support Ukraine in pursuing its European path.""

The statement was published at 3 a.m. local time after hours of debate, Politico notes. It also pledged to protect Ukrainian refugees, help Ukraine rebuild after the war and increase economic pressure on Russia and Belarus, while calling on Russia to withdraw immediately and unconditionally.

Ukraine signed an association agreement — which is considered a precursor to EU accession — with the EU in 2014. Following Russia's invasion last month, Zelenskyy has repeatedly called for the EU to admit Ukraine immediately under a ""new special procedure.""

EU leaders have expressed support for Ukraine and its bid for membership, while stressing that the official road to admission is a long and involved one.

What member countries are saying

Some EU countries have voiced their support for Ukraine's immediate accession in recent weeks.

The presidents of Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia published an open letter on Feb. 28 calling for the EU to admit Ukraine immediately.

""We call on the EU Member States to consolidate highest political support to Ukraine and enable the EU institutions to conduct steps to immediately grant Ukraine a EU candidate country status and open the process of negotiations,"" they wrote.

Leaders of those countries reiterated their calls at the Versailles summit, Deutsche Welle reports.

There are those ""who think that .. Ukrainians are fighting for their lives and (deserve) a strong political message ... and those who are still debating the procedures,"" said Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa.

Indeed, others — like the Netherlands and Germany — are not on board with the idea of speeding up Ukraine's application process.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has rejected the proposal, saying on Thursday, ""It is very important that we continue to pursue the things that we have indeed decided in the past.""

And Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said ahead of the summit that there was consensus in Western Europe against fast-tracking the process, according to Politico. He said the EU is treating Ukraine's application with unprecedented speed, but that it would take ""months, maybe years, before you get to anything.""

""What's important is that Ukraine has asked to be member of the EU (...) there is no fast track procedure to become member of the EU,"" he told reporters on Thursday.

Details on the long road to membership

A country wishing to join the EU must meet a set of conditions that are known as the ""Copenhagen criteria"" and include things like respect for democracy and rule of law. Then it can submit an application to the European Council, which in turn asks the European Commission to weigh in on whether it meets those criteria.

If so, the European Council must draw up a framework for negotiations — which can't start until all 27 member states agree. The negotiations cover 35 chapters of EU law, clustered into six groups.

Once they are complete, the commission recommends the candidate country for membership, and the resulting treaty must be approved unanimously in the council, a majority vote in the European Parliament and by national parliaments of each EU member state.

Accession negotiations take an average of five years, according to the think tank UK in a Changing Europe. It says the quickest countries to negotiate the process were Austria, Finland and Sweden in just under two years, while Croatia took nearly eight.

Five candidate countries are currently integrating EU legislation into national law: Albania, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia and Turkey (which began negotiations in 2005). Two others — Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina — are classified as ""potential candidates"" because they do not yet fulfill the EU's membership criteria.
