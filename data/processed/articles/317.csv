A 40-mile-long (64km) Russian military convoy, composed of tanks, armored vehicles and towed artillery, has sparked dread among defending Ukrainians as it lumbered towards their capital, Kyiv.

The column has been stalled for a week, but now the forces appear to be regrouping, according to Maxar Technologies satellite imagery taken on Thursday, which showed parts of the convoy had “largely dispersed and redeployed.”

Russia is regrouping for a possible attack on Kyiv, say UK defense officials, after initially making limited progress in its advancement towards the capital.

An intelligence update published by the UK’s Ministry of Defence on Friday said Russia “is likely seeking to reset and re-posture its forces for renewed offensive activity in the coming days” and it would likely “include operations against the capital Kyiv.”

With the clouds temporarily clearing around the Ukrainian capital, Maxar said the satellite images show some elements of the convoy have “repositioned” into forests and treelined areas near Lubyanka, Ukraine. The images were taken at 11:37 a.m. local time (4.37 a.m. ET) on Thursday.

According to the satellite imagery, Russian military vehicles are seen sitting on roadways in residential areas in the town of Ozera — 17 miles northwest of Kyiv and just north of the Russian-controlled Antonov Airbase in Hostomel.

Towed artillery and other vehicles are seen taking cover in sparse patches of trees near Lubyanka — about 3 miles (northwest of the Antonov Airbase.

In Berestyanka — 10 miles west of the airbase — a number of fuel trucks and what Maxar says appear to be multiple rocket launchers are seen positioned in a field near trees.

The satellite images taken on Thursday appear to also show fuel storage tanks on fire at the airbase, with a thick black plume of smoke seen rising from the tanks, located at the southern end of the airbase.

Hostomel’s airbase has been the site of intense clashes with Ukrainian forces since the start of Russia’s invasion. It was reportedly captured by the Russian military on February 24.

At the end of what was the convoy, a number of trucks and equipment are still seen on the roadway southeast of Ivankiv.

Satellite images from Maxar also show significant damage to parts of the northern city of Chernihiv and the northwest suburbs of Kyiv.

In Borodyanka, a series of apartment buildings is seen demolished. CNN has previously reported that these apartment buildings were damaged by Russian military strikes.

Just outside of Kyiv’s city limits in Stoyanka, a warehouse is seen in a satellite image completely gutted by fire.

In the city of Chernihiv, roughly 80 miles northeast of Kyiv, the Epicenter K supermarket is also destroyed by fire. The charred remains of the building is seen; there is no more roof.

A fire is also seen burning in one of Chernihiv’s industrial districts, located on its south side.

Russia reorientates

Ukrainians successfully intercepted and attacked an advancing Russian tank column on Thursday as fighting picked up around Kyiv’s northeast and east

An overnight airstrike in the Brovary district, just east of the capital, caused no casualties, according to Kyiv authorities.

Ukrainian authorities report a missile strike in the town of Baryshivka overnight some 45 miles east of the capital.

“According to preliminary information, the Iskander missile caused significant damage to infrastructure and housing. 60 apartment houses were completely damaged, 4 apartment buildings and 10 private houses were partially damaged,” they said.

Thomas Bullock, an analyst at Janes, a UK-based intelligence service, told CNN that “Ukraine’s tactic of targeting supply lines has worked well especially during the first five-10 days of the war. This was partially down to Ukrainian tactics and partially down to how Russia was operating.”

The Russian forces “prioritized rushing forward to secure objectives quickly” in the first couple days of the invasion. This meant “they weren’t advancing as a coherent frontline securing territory as they go. This effectively allowed Ukrainian forces to slip behind Russia’s advanced mechanized units and attack logistics columns traveling on unsecured roads in the rear.”

But as “Russia begins to reorient its forces for a longer war following their failure to secure a quick victory” it is “unclear how effective this tactic will be,” Bullock added.

The British Ministry of Defense update added that logistical issues continue to hamper the Russian advance “as does strong Ukrainian resistance.”

French armed forces spokesperson Pascal Ianni reiterated the UK assessment on Friday, saying the Russian army was poorly prepared for its invasion of Ukraine and is now facing many difficulties on the ground, “particularly in the logistical field and in the field of intelligence,” he told French TV station France2.

“It is possible that an attack on Kyiv will be carried out in the next few days, but actually taking control of Kyiv is a whole other matter and will take a long, long time,” he said.

The convoy is believed to have entered Ukraine via Belarus, a key ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and where Russia moved huge numbers of troops to in recent weeks to carry out what they called joint exercises. When the exercises ended, the troops didn’t leave and satellite images actually showed that Russia increased their military presence in the country.

The convoy’s dispersal comes after major cities in Ukraine — including Dnipro in the center and Lutsk in the far west of the country — were attacked by Russian forces Friday.

As Ukrainian officials attempt to open evacuation routes on Friday around Kyiv, the United Nations said 2.5 million people had fled the country and 2 million people are displaced within Ukraine.

Russian convoy heading to Kyiv reportedly dispersed 0:48

(CNN) —

The 40-mile-long Russian military convoy, complete with tanks, armored vehicles and artillery, has struck fear among Ukrainians defending their country as it lumbers toward the capital Kyiv.

Russia-Ukraine War: Breaking News, Invasion Analysis and News

The column of vehicles remained stagnant for a week.

But now the forces appear to be regrouping, according to Maxar Technologies satellite images taken on Thursday showing parts of the convoy that had ""largely dispersed and redeployed.""

Russia is regrouping for a possible attack on Kyiv, Britain's defense officials warn, after initially making limited progress in its advance on the capital.

Towed artillery and other vehicles are seen sheltered in a wooded area near Lubyanka.

What we know about the convoy

An update from Britain's Defense Ministry on Friday indicated that Russia ""is likely looking to re-establish and reposition its forces for renewed offensive activity in the coming days.""

He added that this would probably ""include operations against the capital, Kyiv.""

As the clouds temporarily clear around the Ukrainian capital, Maxar said satellite images show that some elements of the convoy have ""relocated"" to forests and wooded areas near Lubyanka, Ukraine.

The images were taken on Thursday at 11:37 am local time (4:37 am ET).

Some 6,000 Russian soldiers may have been killed in Ukraine so far, according to a US official.

According to satellite images, Russian military vehicles can be seen on the streets of residential areas in the city of Ozera, 27 kilometers northwest of Kyiv and just north of the Russian-controlled Antonov airbase in Hostomel.

Towed artillery and other vehicles are seen sheltered in scattered patches of trees near Lubyanka, about 4 kilometers northwest of the Antonov air base.

Russian military vehicles are seen in this image over residential streets in Ozera.

At Berestyanka, 10 miles west of the air base, several fuel trucks and what Maxar says appear to be multiple rocket launchers are located in a field near trees.

Satellite images taken on Thursday also appear to show burning fuel storage tanks at the air base, along with a thick plume of black smoke billowing from the vehicles, located on the southern edge of the air base.

This is the panorama in the cities of Kharkiv and Dnipro 0:37

The Hostómel airbase has been the scene of intense clashes with Ukrainian forces since the beginning of the Russian invasion.

Supposedly, the Russian Army took the place on February 24.

At the end of what was the convoy, several trucks and equipment can still be seen on the road southeast of Ivankiv.

What satellite images of the convoy show

Satellite images from Maxar also reveal significant damage to parts of the city of Chernihiv and the northwestern suburbs of Kyiv.

It is noted that in Borodyanka a number of apartment buildings were demolished.

CNN previously reported that these buildings sustained damage from Russian military strikes.

A satellite image shows that just outside Kyiv's city limits in Stoyanka, the fire completely destroyed a warehouse.

In the city of Chernihiv, approximately 128 kilometers northeast of Kyiv, the Epicenter K supermarket was also destroyed by fire.

The charred remains of the building, which was left without a roof, can be seen.

This is what we know about the 60 km long Russian convoy outside the Ukrainian capital

A fire is also seen in one of Chernihiv's industrial districts, located on its southern side.

Russia reorients its forces

The Ukrainians successfully intercepted and attacked an advancing Russian tank column on Thursday, as fighting resumed in northeastern and eastern Kyiv.

An overnight airstrike carried out on the Brovary district, just east of the capital, left no casualties, according to Kyiv authorities.

Is it safe to travel to Europe in the midst of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine?

In addition, Ukrainian authorities reported a missile attack on the city of Baryshivka overnight, some 72 kilometers east of the capital.

""According to preliminary information, an Iskander missile caused significant damage to infrastructure and housing. Sixty apartment houses were completely damaged, 4 apartment buildings and 10 private houses were partially damaged,"" they said.

Several fuel trucks and what Maxar says appear to be multiple rocket launchers are seen positioned in a field in Berestyanka.

Thomas Bullock, an analyst at Janes, a British-based intelligence service, told CNN that ""Ukraine's tactic of targeting supply lines has worked well. Especially during the first 5 to 10 days of the war. This was partly due to Ukrainian tactics and partly due to how Russia operated.""

Russia's forces ""prioritized advancing rapidly to secure their objectives"" in the early days of the invasion.

This meant that they ""did not advance as a coherent front line that secured territory as they approached. This allowed Ukrainian forces to slip behind Russia's advanced mechanized units and attack logistics columns traveling on unsafe roads."" in the rear.""

However, as ""Russia begins to reorient its forces for a longer war, following its failure to secure a quick victory,"" it is ""unclear how effective this tactic will be,"" Bullock added.

Ukraine and Russia hold talks as the war continues: here's what you need to know

The update from Britain's Defense Ministry added that logistical problems continue to hamper the Russian advance, ""as does strong Ukrainian resistance.""

France's armed forces spokesman Pascal Ianni reiterated Britain's assessment on Friday.

In that regard, he said that the Russian Army was poorly prepared for its invasion of Ukraine and now faces many difficulties on the ground.

""Especially in the logistics field and in the intelligence field,"" he told French television station France2.

""It is possible that an attack will be carried out in Kyiv in the next few days. But in reality, taking control of Kyiv is a completely different matter and it will take a long, long time,"" he insisted.

The convoy is believed to have entered Ukraine through Belarus, a key ally of President Vladimir Putin.

In fact, it is the country where Russia has moved large numbers of troops in recent weeks to carry out what they called joint exercises.

When the training ended, the Russian troops did not leave and satellite images showed that Moscow increased its military presence in the country.

NATO fighting a war against Russia in Ukraine would be World War III, Joe Biden has warned.

The US President said American troops will not be sent to Ukraine. But he added: ""I want to be clear: We will defend every inch of Nato territory with the full might of a united and galvanised Nato.""

In a video address released in the early hours of this morning, President Biden said: ""We will make sure Ukraine has weapons to defend against an invading Russian Force... We will send money and food and aid to save the Ukrainian people - and I will welcome Ukrainian refugees. We should welcome them here with open arms.

""We're going to continue to stand together with our allies in Europe and and send an unmistakeable message: We'll defend every single inch of NATO's territory, with the full might of the united and galvanized NATO.

""We will not fight a war against Russia in Ukraine. Direct confrontation between NATO and Russia is World War III - something we must strive to prevent.

""But we already know Putin's war against Ukraine will never be a victory. He hoped to dominate Ukraine without a fight, he failed. He hoped to fracture European resolve, he failed.

""He hoped to weaken the trans-Atlantic alliance, he failed. He hoped to split apart American democracy in terms of our positions, he failed.

""The American people are united, the world is united and we stand with the people of Ukraine. We will not let autocrats and would-be emperors dictate the direction of the world.

""Democracies are rising to meet this moment, rallying the world to the side of peace and the side of security. We're showing our strength and we will not falter.

10,000 dead in city, claims adviser to mayor

Officials now estimate that 10,000 people have been killed by Russian attacks in the Sea of Azov city Mariupol - with fears that number will rise to 20,000.

Petr Andryushchenko, adviser to the city’s mayor, told Canadian press: ""We now estimate that number of people killed has reached 10,000. And if the Russians keep shelling, we may see more than 20,000 people killed because of the Russian attacks.""

Mr Andryushchenko's claims have not been independently confirmed, but Mariupol has been held under siege for nearly two weeks. Mr Andryushchenko, who was was able to leave Mariupol on Wednesday, told The Globe and Mail that some people have taken to drinking water from heating radiators because they had been cut off from water and electricity.

Kyiv and Mykolayiv heavily shelled overnight

Ukraine's capital Kyiv and surrounding towns reportedly came under heavy attack last night - as did the strategically important Black Sea port of Mykolayiv. CNN reported several explosions in Kyiv.

Chief international correspondent Clarissa Ward noted “a nonstop volley… of just heavy booms in the distance” overnight on March 12.

""Heavy fighting continues in the areas outside Kyiv, including in Bucha, Irpin, and Hostomel,"" tweeted The Kyiv Independent.

Meanwhile, The Economist's correspondent in Ukraine shared video purportedly showing multiple blasts in Mykolayiv. Oliver Carroll tweeted: ""Nightmarish scenes in port of Mykolayiv this evening. Regional governor Vitaly Kim says Ukraine has repelled the attack. The city is key to any future assault on Odessa, further down on the Black Sea coast.""

As morning dawned on Ukraine today, air raid sirens once again blared across more than 15 regions and multiple cities at around 6am local time. The BBC reported they had ""sounded in the capital Kyiv, along with key cities like Odessa in the south, Sumy in the north, Kharkiv in the east and Dnipro in the south-east"".

ITV News Correspondent Dan Rivers tweeted: ""I am witnessing Air strikes near Kropyvytskyi this morning. Multiple impacts on edge of the town - you can hear impact on this clip.""

Kropyvnytskyi is a city in central Ukraine on the Inhul river with a population of more than 220,000.

In an 'intelligence update' issued late last night, the UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD) said Russia was relying on ""relatively inaccurate and indiscriminate"" weapons. The use of these ""unguided dumb munitions... significantly increases the likelihood of civilian casualties,"" added the MoD.

In a further update this morning, the UK MoD said: ""Fighting north-west of Kyiv continues with the bulk of the Russian ground forces now around 25km from the centre of the city.

""Elements of the large Russian column north of Kyiv has dispersed. This is likely to support a Russian attempt to encircle the city. It could also be an attempt to encircle the city. It could also be an attempt by Russia to reduce its vulnerability to Ukrainian counter attacks, which have taken a significant toll on Russian Forces.

""Beyond Kyiv, the cities of Kherkiv, Cherniv, Sumy and Mariupol remain encircled and continue to suffer from heavy Russian shelling.""

The actions of the Russian invaders will b e equated with the actions of [Islamic State] terrorists.""

He called on all Ukrainians to resist the Russians, and appealed to Russian mothers. ""Do not send your children to war in a foreign country,"" said Zelensky. ""Check where your son is. And if you have the slightest suspicion that your son could be sent to war against Ukraine, act immediately"".

UK seeks to hit Kremlin with ban on exporting luxury goods to Russia

The UK Government is intending to further ramp up pressure on the Kremlin with plans to ban exports of luxury goods to Russia, in the latest move to isolate Vladimir Putin. Details of the plans will be set out in the coming days, Downing Street said.

It came as Boris Johnson joined with other G7 leaders on Friday to commit to further increase the pressure on the Russian president’s regime. The group agreed to take steps to deny Russia “most favoured nation” status on key products, which No 10 said would significantly reduce the ability of Russian businesses to export.

Sharing the news on Friday evening, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the UK stood “united with our G7 partners”, and would “continue strengthening our response” to put a halt to Russia’s aggression against its neighbour.
