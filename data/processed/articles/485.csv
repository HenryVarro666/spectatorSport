US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday that Russia was not making serious efforts in negotiations with Ukraine to end the three-week war.

""On the one hand, we commend Ukraine for being at the table despite being under bombardment every minute of the day,"" Blinken said.

1,e47f4f67-c5b1-413d-ae03-dab85d299822,[],,"SECRETARY BLINKEN: Good afternoon, everyone.

Three weeks ago, Russia launched its unprovoked war on Ukraine.

With every day that passes, the numbers of civilians, including children, killed and wounded continues to climb.

Russia continues to attack civilian sites, including – this week alone – a hospital, three schools, a boarding school for visually impaired kids in the Luhansk region of Ukraine.

Yesterday Russian forces bombed a theater in Mariupol, where hundreds of people had been taking shelter.

The word “children” had been written in Russian in giant white letters on the pavement outside the building, so that you could know from the air that there were children inside.

Russian forces also opened fire on 10 civilians in who were waiting in line for bread.

These incidents join a long list of attacks on civilian – not military – locations across Ukraine, including apartment buildings, public squares, and, last week, a maternity hospital in Mariupol.

I doubt that any of us who saw those images will ever forget them.

We’ve seen Russia use similar tactics before in Grozny and Aleppo. They stepped up their bombardment with the goal of breaking the will of the people.

Yesterday President Biden said that, in his opinion, war crimes have been committed in Ukraine.

Personally, I agree.

Intentionally targeting civilians is a war crime.

After all the destruction of the past three weeks, I find it difficult to conclude that the Russians are doing otherwise.

The consequences of Moscow’s war are being felt around the world – in rising food costs, concerns about fuel supplies, more broadly in worries about how this war will affect the global economy and the fight against COVID-19.

These are serious issues that the global community urgently needs to address. This war is making that much more difficult.

In this way, Russia’s actions are having an impact on every person on the planet, wherever they live.

We also feel the impact right here in this room.

There should be a seat reserved here today for Benjamin Hall from Fox News, who was injured badly when his vehicle came under attack near Kyiv.

Many of us, myself included, have gotten to know Ben very well as part of the traveling press corps.

He’s an incredibly talented reporter, always asking tough questions. He’s a lovely person, as well.

Our thoughts – my thoughts – are with him and his family, including his three little kids.

Two of Ben’s Fox News colleagues, Pierre Zokchefski and Sasha Koofshenova, were killed in the attack. And Brent Renaud, a reporter on assignment with Time Magazine, was killed in a separate attack a day earlier.

I know that everyone in this room, in particular, feels these losses deeply.

Being a war correspondent is vital work; they make sure that the world knows what’s really happening when armies move in and bombs start falling.

It also takes incredible courage; they go into war zones when others, understandably, are heading out as fast as possible.

So these are huge losses, of course, for families, for friends, but also for their colleagues, their profession, their readers and viewers who understand world events because of them.

Our experts are in the process of documenting and evaluating potential war crimes being committed in Ukraine.

Beth Van Schaack, whom the Senate finally confirmed this week as our Ambassador at Large for Global Criminal Justice, will be leading that effort within the State Department.

We’ll make sure that our findings help international efforts to investigate war crimes and hold those responsible accountable.

I’d also mention that there are several other nominations before the Senate with a direct bearing on our ability to support Ukraine, including for Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees, and Migration; Assistant Secretary of State for International Security and Non-Proliferation; and our Coordinator for Sanctions Policy.

So I urge the Senate to confirm these nominees quickly, so that they can get to work as soon as possible.

A few weeks ago, just days before Russia’s invasion began, I went to the United Nations Security Council to lay out what we believed was about to happen.

Again today, we have a strong sense of what Russia could do next.

We believe that Moscow may be setting the stage to use a chemical weapon, and then falsely blame Ukraine to justify escalating its attacks on the Ukrainian people.

Manufacturing events and creating false narratives of genocide to justify greater use of military force is a tactic that Russia has used before, including in Georgia.

We believe Russia will bring its mercenaries from private military groups and foreign countries to Ukraine.

President Putin acknowledged as much over the weekend when he authorized the recruitment of additional forces from the Middle East and elsewhere – another indication that his war effort is not going as he hoped it would.

They are also likely to systematically kidnap local officials and replace them with puppets.

Again, this has already begun.

The mayor of Melitopol was grabbed off the street several days ago, released yesterday in a prisoner exchange.

The mayor of another city in southern Ukraine was also kidnapped; he hasn’t yet been let go.

This is a terror tactic – grab local officials, depose local governments, put proxies in their place.

After devastating Ukrainian cities, Moscow may bring in officials from Russia to serve as local government officials, and surge what they describe as “economic support” in an attempt to make the people dependent on Moscow for survival.

Again, something that Russia did in Georgia.

President Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is not going to plan.

The Ukrainian people haven’t welcomed the Russian military. They haven’t submitted.

On the contrary. They’re fighting with extraordinary courage to protect their homes, their families, their country.

Russia has been hit by unprecedented sanctions and cut off from the global economy.

Its own economy is in free fall.

Hundreds of corporations have closed operations.

In a matter of weeks, President Putin has destroyed 30 years of opening to the world and economic opportunity for the Russian people.

Dozens of members of the Kremlin’s corrupt power base have been sanctioned; several have lost their mega yachts and villas.

President Putin has derided those sanctions, using recent public diatribes to mock Russians living abroad as too dependent, as he said, on “foie gras and oysters.”

Meanwhile, he sits in his mansions, having accumulated billions taking wealth from the Russian people, while they stand in long lines to access cash and watch as stores close and the ruble plummets in value.

It’s no wonder that brave Russians continue to protest the war and be beaten and arrested for it.

And Russian journalists are resigning from their jobs at state media outlets, because they can’t stomach parroting the Kremlin’s lies any longer.

Still, President Putin is not relenting and in fact may be growing more desperate.

And so yesterday, President Biden authorized – announced, excuse me, not authorized – another $800 million in military aid to Ukraine.

That brings our support for Ukraine’s frontline defenders to more than $2 billion during this administration – one billion in the last week alone.

We’re grateful to have a determined and generous partner in Congress, which this week provided more than $13 billion in urgent support to Ukraine.

And we’ll continue to work with lawmakers to support Ukraine and hold the Kremlin to account.

As President Biden described, this new security assistance package includes 800 anti-aircraft systems, to stop attacking planes and helicopters before they destroy more of Ukraine; 9,000 anti-armor systems to destroy tanks and armored vehicles; 7,000 small arms, including machine guns and grenade launchers; and 20 million rounds of ammunition.

We’re also helping Ukraine acquire longer-range anti-aircraft systems and munitions, at President Zelenskyy’s request.

And I have been in almost daily contact with Foreign Minister Kuleba, coordinating to respond swiftly to Ukraine’s most urgent needs.

Our allies and partners continue to step up with their own significant shipments of security assistance.

I’ve authorized more than a dozen countries to provide U.S.-origin equipment, and dozens more around the world have provided security assistance of their own.

I’d also note that, in addition to assistance from the Department of Defense, we’re sending support from other agencies, including $10 million worth of armored vehicles from our own Diplomatic Security Service.

And yesterday I announced another $186 million in humanitarian assistance to help the more than 3 million refugees who have fled Ukraine in the past three weeks – the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II – as well as internally displaced people still in Ukraine.

This brings our total humanitarian aid since last month to $293 million.

And of the more than $13 billion for Ukraine that Congress is putting forward, more than 4 billion of that will go to humanitarian assistance.

Ukraine’s neighbors in Europe are generously welcoming, supporting refugees. The United States will do our part to help those governments and the humanitarian organizations on the ground meet this tremendous need.

All the steps that we and our allies and partners are taking are aimed at one goal: to end the war.

The support we’re providing Ukraine, as well as our financial and economic measures against Moscow, will strengthen Ukraine’s hand at the diplomatic table.

And we commend Ukraine for staying at that table and continuing to pursue diplomacy while the Kremlin’s brutal aggression continues.

We’ll support Ukraine’s diplomatic efforts however we can.

We continue to call on all nations, especially those with direct influence with Russia, to use whatever leverage they have to compel Moscow to end this war of choice.

We believe China in particular has a responsibility to use its influence with President Putin and to defend the international rules and principles that it professes to support.

Instead, it appears that China is moving in the opposite direction by refusing to condemn this aggression while seeking to portray itself as a neutral arbiter – and we’re concerned that they are considering directly assisting Russia with military equipment to use in Ukraine.

President Biden will be speaking to President Xi tomorrow and will make clear that China will bear responsibility for any actions it takes to support Russia’s aggression, and we will not hesitate to impose costs.

Let me close by saying that President Zelenskyy’s message to Congress and to the American people yesterday was incredibly powerful.

He’s asked for more help, which we are providing and will continue to provide.

And he said that the people of Ukraine want the same things for themselves that we want for ourselves – democracy, independence, freedom.

No one who’s watched the events of the past three weeks could ever doubt the depth of Ukraine’s commitment to these ideals.

We’ll continue to stand with Ukraine as it fights for its future.

We’ll continue to increase the costs on Russia until it ends this war of choice.

And we’ll continue to provide life-saving aid to the Ukrainian people as they endure the brutal consequences of Russia’s aggression.

With that, happy to take some questions.

MR PRICE: Paul.

QUESTION: Sir, what do you think about the talks between Ukraine and Russia? Are they making any progress? President Zelenskyy seems to suggest there are things they are talking about.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: So we’re in close contact, as I said, with Ukraine’s leaders, including in my case Foreign Minister Kuleba. We’re in close contact with other countries that have, in one way or another, been engaging on diplomacy.

And to date I have to say, on the one hand, we commend Ukraine for being at the table, despite being under bombardment every minute of that day. At the same time, I have not seen any meaningful efforts by Russia to bring this war that it’s perpetrating to a conclusion through diplomacy.

We support Ukraine’s efforts to try to de-escalate through diplomacy, to reach a ceasefire, and of course the withdrawal of Russian forces. We appreciate the efforts of other countries, including France, Germany, Israel, Turkey, and others. But again, from where I sit, diplomacy requires both sides engaging in good faith to de-escalate, and I don’t see signs right now that Putin is prepared to stop.

On the contrary, if you listen to, just for example, his most recent remarks yesterday, that suggests that he is moving in the opposite direction. But never mind the words. What we’re really focused on is actions, and the actions that we’re seeing Russia take every single day, virtually every minute of every day, are in total contrast to any serious diplomatic effort to end the war.

So we’re looking to see Russia take meaningful actions to de-escalate, to stop the violence that it’s perpetrating on Ukraine, and to engage in good-faith talks. We will support any effort that Ukraine makes to do that. We’re certainly doing everything we can to back them, but also to make sure that they have the strongest possible hand, if there are any real negotiations and if diplomacy does advance – hence the support that we’re giving to Ukraine as well as the pressure that we continue to put and even increase on Russia.

MR PRICE: Kylie.

QUESTION: Thank you, Secretary. There is – this department is confirming that an American has died in Ukraine today, so I’m wondering if you can share any more with us about the circumstances, about who that person is, and if there’ll be specific consequences for Russia because an American died.

And then second, earlier this week you said on CNN that one way or another Ukraine will be there and at some point Putin won’t. But we’re watching every day Ukrainians are getting killed; their cities are being demolished. So how can you be so confident to say something like that? And are you suggesting that Putin should be removed as the leader of Russia? Thank you.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Kylie, first, with regard to the American citizen, I can confirm that an American citizen was killed. I don’t have any more details for you than that, but I can confirm that.

Second, it is I think not only clear to me but clear to the world that an independent Ukraine will be there long after Vladimir Putin. And it’s also clear that this could horrifically go on for some time. But when all is said and done, an independent Ukraine will be there, and at some point Vladimir Putin will not. The real question is how much death and destruction is going to occur in the meantime. And we’re doing everything we can to bring this war, perpetrated by Russia, to the quickest possible end. That’s where the support for Ukraine comes in; that’s where the pressure on Russia comes in; that’s where the work, the coordination that we’re doing with countries around the world comes in.

But I think the world has seen this. The world has seen the absolute determination of the Ukrainian people to hold onto their country, to hold onto their future, to hold onto their freedom. And there is nothing that Vladimir Putin can do to subjugate that to his will. But as I said, this could go on for some time, and we’re going to continue to work to bring it to an end as quickly as we can.

QUESTION: And should Putin remain the leader of Russia?

MR PRICE: Kylie, we’re going to try and move around.

Conor.

QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, you described what you called Russia’s terror tactics. Is the State Department considering designating Russia a state sponsor – excuse me – of terrorism?

And then second, everything that you described, the words that the President has used in recent days – war criminal, murderous dictator, pure thug – do you think that there can ever be normal relations between the United States and Russia so long as Vladimir Putin is in power?

SECRETARY BLINKEN: So our focus first and foremost is on doing everything we can to help bring this war to a quick end, to stop the suffering of the Ukrainian people that’s the result of Russia’s aggression on Ukraine. That’s our focus. As we’re doing that, and as I said earlier, we’re also looking very carefully at what is happening, what is being done, and in particular looking at the question of whether war crimes are being committed.

And, among other things, the intentional targeting of civilians would constitute a war crime. You heard President Biden speak to this yesterday. You heard what I said a few minutes ago. So we are documenting. We welcome the efforts of various groups, institutions, organizations that focus on this to bring all of the evidence together, to continue to document things, and then for there to be accountability one way or the other.

In terms of other designations based on actions that Russia’s taking, we are and we will look at everything.

MR PRICE: Yulia Yarmolenko.

QUESTION: On the second question? I’m sorry.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: I’m sorry, remind me.

QUESTION: As long as Putin is in power, can there be normal relations between Russia and the United States?

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Again, our focus is on ending this war. I don’t want to speculate about the future, but there’s going to have to be, one way or another, accountability for this war of aggression.

MR PRICE: Yulia Yarmolenko, VOA Ukraine.

QUESTION: Thank you. So on possible negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, if Russia agrees to stop attacks and withdraw its forces from Ukraine, are there any security formats that will guarantee that Russia would not renew its aggression against Ukraine? If it’s not membership in NATO for Ukraine, then what?

And another question. President Biden said that U.S. will accept Ukrainian refugees with open arms, and so far there is no official visa or other program for Ukrainians who are fleeing war or who want to come to the United States or reunite with their families. Is Department of State working on some special expedited program for Ukrainian refugees? And if yes, when it might be launched?

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you. First, on the diplomacy, look, I’m not going to speculate on the substance of any negotiations, where that might go. As I said, we fully and strongly support whatever the Government of Ukraine – the democratically elected Government of Ukraine – does. We very much welcome sentiments that we’ve heard expressed for trying to bring this to a diplomatic end as quickly as possible.

I think in the first instance what Ukraine needs is de-escalation. It needs Russian forces out of Ukraine. It needs to have its basic freedom and independence returned, but I leave it to Ukrainian partners to work on advancing the diplomacy if that’s – if they believe that can be productive. We will look at whatever we can do to support that.

And if there are issues that wind up being negotiated that require in some fashion our participation, of course we will look at that and see where we can be helpful. We want to be able in the first instance to do what we’re doing, which is to support the Government of Ukraine, the Ukrainian people, along with putting pressure on Russia. If diplomacy finally carries the day and there are things that we can do to support that diplomacy and to support any outcomes that restore Ukraine’s independence, we will, of course, look at that and I’m sure do that.

With regard to refugees, a couple of things. First, as I said, this is the largest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II. The numbers are staggering. And, of course, what gets lost sometimes behind these numbers are the real lives that are at stake and that are being changed, maybe not forever, but are being changed in profound ways.

I saw some of that firsthand when I was on the border between Poland and Ukraine with a number of you just a couple of weeks ago, talking to people who had made the journey across the border, looking for safety in the face of this Russian onslaught. And in many cases – most cases, women and children – the men staying behind to fight.

And we see the impact, of course, in Ukraine. We see the impact on neighboring countries – Poland, Moldova, Romania, others – that are taking in very large numbers of refugees. The generosity I think is extraordinary. But the numbers are growing. The challenge is growing. I was on a call, a video conference, this morning with our G7 partners, and this is one of the things that we talked about – having a coordinated approach to dealing with and helping refugees coming over.

The United States is already and will remain the largest provider of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. Part of the package that is in the supplemental includes about $4 billion in humanitarian assistance, and that will go both directly to Ukraine. It will also go to neighboring countries and others – and Ukrainians outside of Ukraine – to support them.

Second, we are working closely with UNHCR to see how we can support this effort.

Finally, we’re looking at things that we can do ourselves and do directly – for example, looking at steps we may be able to take on family reunification and other things that we can do to be supportive and to really take part in this effort.

Last thing I’ll say is this: What – and of course, there is the refugee referral process, but that takes time. But if people apply for refugee status and seek to come to the United States, of course we will take referrals. But we’re looking at steps that we can take in the near term.

Last thing is this: I think what we’re seeing, at least initially, is that so many people coming out of Ukraine understandably want to stay close to home. They hope – we hope – that they’ll be able to return home as soon as possible. They also want to stay close to home because, as I said, in many cases it’s women and children who have left behind spouses, husbands, fathers, brothers, and they want to be reunited as quickly as possible, so they want to stay as close as possible. But as this and if this goes on, as the numbers increase, as the burden increases for European partners, we will certainly do everything we can to help. So I suspect we’ll have more to say on this in the coming – in the coming days. It’s something we’re very focused on right now.

MR PRICE: Time for one final, quick question from Andrea.

QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, you’ve outlined, recounted a litany of horrific attacks on civilians. You’ve said you agree with the President’s comment that they’re war crimes, as the UN ambassador said last week. I know there has to be an investigation, but where will the accountability be? What should happen to Vladimir Putin if he is found guilty, since he is the state? What should happen to this (inaudible)? Tell the world.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: So, Andrea, a few things. First, we’re all seeing what – and you’re showing, powerfully, on television – these devastating images coming out of Ukraine, and we are seeing the destruction of so much of the country by Russian bombs, artillery. We’re seeing civilian sites being devastated; we’re seeing people being killed – hundreds, thousands of people, civilians. And yes, as I – again, as the President said yesterday, in his opinion, war crimes are being committed. I agree with that. After all the destruction that we’ve seen, it’s really hard to conclude otherwise.

But what we’re doing is this – and I’ll come to your question – we are in the first instance supporting the very important work that’s being done, the evidentiary process to bring the evidence together, to document what’s happened, to support and to work with human rights activists, with civil society, with independent media as well as with the appropriate organizations and institutions that look into this. So we need to go through this process of compiling the evidence, collecting the evidence, understanding the evidence. We’ll share that – and our allies and partners I’m sure will do the same with all of the investigations that are ongoing – to support accountability using every tool that we have available.

I’m not going to get ahead of, first of all, what the outcome will be or what the consequences will be, but I can say with conviction that there will be accountability for any war crimes that are determined to have occurred.

QUESTION: How can you say that after Aleppo and Grozny? He does it repeatedly. He’s a repeat offender as a war criminal.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Andrea, when we said before Russia’s aggression that there would be massive consequences for that aggression, including unprecedented sanctions on Russia, I know some people had their doubts. I think we’ve demonstrated that we’ve been good to our word. When we said that there would be sustained, powerful support for Ukraine in its efforts to defend itself, we’ve demonstrated that we’re good to our word. So when I tell you that there will be accountability and consequences for any war crimes that have been committed, I hope you’ll take me at my word, but actions always speak louder than words.

MR PRICE: Thank you very much, everyone.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you. Thanks.",https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-a-press-availability-16/

Russia may stage chemical weapon attack and blame Ukraine, Blinken says

Russia may stage a chemical attack to escalate the war against Ukraine, Blinken has said, noting that Washington accurately predicted the Russian invasion weeks before it started.

“We believe that Moscow may be setting the stage to use a chemical weapon, and then falsely blame Ukraine to justify escalating its attacks on the Ukrainian people,” Blinken told reporters at the US State Department.

The top US diplomat also said Washington believes that Moscow will bring in mercenaries from foreign countries to fight in the conflict. He added that Russia will “systematically” kidnap local Ukrainian officials to replace them “with puppets”.

EU says dependence on fossil fuels is funding Russian ‘war chest’

The European Union’s dependence on Russian fossil fuels is financing Russia’s “war chest”, the bloc’s environment policy chief has said.

“I don’t need to go deep into our dependency on fossil fuels, and how many billions every year we pay to [the] Russian war chest,” EU Commissioner for the Environment Virginijus Sinkevicius told a news conference in Brussels.

“The less we’re dependent, the better it is for us,” he said, referring to Europe’s reliance on energy from Russia, which provides 40 percent of the bloc’s gas.

Influx of Ukrainians will become big challenge for Germany, Scholz says

The growing number of Ukrainians seeking refuge in Germany will become a “big, big challenge”, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said.

Speaking after talks with the leaders of Germany’s 16 states to discuss the coronavirus pandemic, Scholz said that despite the challenge it should be relatively easy to help Ukrainians settle in given that they don’t need visas to enter Germany and they have automatic access to healthcare and education as well as language and integration courses.

German police have so far registered just under 190,000 Ukrainians who have fled Russia’s invasion of their country.

More than 3.2 million people have fled Ukraine, more expected to leave

About 3.2 million people have fled Ukraine, according to data released by the United Nations.

While the numbers arriving in the front-line states – Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Moldova – have slowed in recent days, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said he expected a “bigger wave” next week.

“The war is not subsiding, but spreading; and as it spreads, there is the risk that next week will see the arrival of more people in Hungary, presenting us with a huge challenge,” he said in a video posted on his Facebook page.

“They are not only fleeing from areas threatened by war, but also from war zones themselves.”

Mariupol officials say number of possible casualties at theatre is unclear

Authorities in Mariupol have said it was still not possible to estimate the number of potential casualties from what they said was an air strike on a theatre where hundreds of people were believed to have been sheltering.

It provided no figures on the number of people rescued.

The International Committee of the Red Cross has called on the warring parties to allow safe passage out of besieged Mariupol and allow aid in, the organisation’s head Peter Maurer said.

Russia is rethinking its approach: Analyst

Speaking to Al Jazeera, Frank Ledwidge, senior lecturer in military capabilities and strategy at the University of Portsmouth, said Russia’s attack “has, in military terms, culminated”.

“Essentially, that they’ve gone as far as they can with the logistics and weaponry they brought into the country – that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s stalled,” he added.

“What we’re seeing now is what’s called an operational pause as they start to get, in colloquial terms, their act together, which they have not had largely due to very poor planning assumptions in the early part of the campaign.

“So they’d be working frantically to try to get weapons and get their planning sorted out and to understand where does it go next. And of course, Ukrainians have a say in that, which is why we are starting to see counterattacks by Ukrainian armed forces that seem to be having some effect.”

“The use of unconventional means would constitute an intolerable escalation and would lead in response to absolutely massive and radical economic sanctions, without taboos,” he added.

US says Russian troops still stalled outside Kyiv

Russia continues to make little tangible progress across most of Ukraine, and Russian forces are still stalled outside Kyiv while continuing to bombard the capital city with missiles, a senior US defence official has said.

One key development has been increased Russian naval activity in the northern Black Sea, where ships were shelling suburbs of Odesa, the Associated Press cited the official as saying.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it is not clear what the Russians intend to do, but the shelling could be the start of preparations to launch a ground assault on Odesa.

Ukraine swapped nine Russian soldiers to free detained mayor: Interfax

Ukraine has handed over nine captured Russian soldiers to secure the freedom of the mayor of the southeastern city of Melitopol, who was detained last week, the Interfax Ukraine news agency has reported.

The office of President Zelenskyy earlier said mayor Ivan Fedorov had been released but gave no details.

“Ivan Fedorov was released from Russian captivity … For him, Russia received nine captured soldiers who were born in 2002 and 2003. These are actually children,” Interfax Ukraine quoted Zelenskyy’s press aide Darya Zarivnaya as saying.

Ukraine says Russia attacked Mariupol theatre sheltering civilians

Russian forces have bombed a theatre in the besieged city of Mariupol where hundreds of civilians were sheltering, Ukrainian officials have said, even as the sides signalled optimism over continuing talks to end the war in Ukraine.

There was no immediate word on deaths or injuries in what the Mariupol city council said was an air strike on the theatre. The Ukrainian foreign ministry said many people were trapped in the building and accused Russia of committing a war crime.

UN Security Council to vote Friday on Russian proposal

The UN Security Council will vote on Friday on a Russian-drafted call for aid access and civilian protection in Ukraine, but diplomats say the measure is set to fail because it does not push for an end to the fighting or a withdrawal of Russian troops.

The draft resolution also does not address accountability or acknowledge Russia’s invasion of its neighbour, the Reuters news agency reported.

“Their resolution calls for parties to respect international humanitarian law, but leaves out the fact that Russia is committing war crimes,” said Britain’s UN ambassador Barbara Woodward.

Kremlin slams Biden for calling Putin a ‘war criminal’

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has called Biden’s characterisation of Putin as a war criminal “unacceptable and unforgivable rhetoric”, the Tass news agency said.

“He is a war criminal,” Biden told reporters in Washington, referring to the Russian leader.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki later said the US president was simply answering a “direct question”.

“We have all seen barbaric acts, horrific acts by a foreign dictator in a country that is threatening and taking the lives of civilians, impacting hospitals, women who are pregnant, journalists, others,” she told reporters.

Ukraine negotiator says reported draft peace plan reflects Russian requests

Ukraine’s top negotiator Mikhailo Podolyak has said a draft 15-point peace plan described by the Financial Times reflects the requests of the Russian side.

Podolyak said on Twitter that Ukraine has its own positions, including “a ceasefire, withdrawal of Russian troops and security guarantees from a number of countries”.

Talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators to end the war in Ukraine are continuing, as leaders in both countries said on Wednesday that there appeared to be room for compromise to reach an agreement.

On Moscow visit, Turkey’s top diplomat says war must stop

Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, who will visit Ukraine on Thursday, has said the war must stop and offered to pursue diplomatic efforts to arrange a lasting ceasefire.

Speaking alongside his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Moscow, Cavusoglu said, “The war must stop, people must not die. I came here to Moscow with this understanding today.

“We have shared our concerns in a sincere way and done our part to ease tensions and open the stage for diplomacy,” he said. “We would like to host this [Putin-Zelenskyy] meeting when the situation comes to that point … for a lasting ceasefire.”

This was stated on Thursday at a press briefing in Washington by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, an Ukrinform correspondent reports.

""Today, I have to say, on the one hand, we commend Ukraine for being at the table despite being under bombardment every minute of the day. At the same time, I’ve not seen any meaningful efforts by Russia to bring this war that it’s perpetrating to a conclusion through diplomacy,"" he said.

According to the secretary of state, the United States fully supports Ukraine's efforts to de-escalate through diplomacy, to reach a ceasefire, and the withdrawal of Russian forces. In this regard, Blinken welcomed the efforts of other nations, including France, Germany, Israel, and Turkey.

The U.S. top diplomat stressed that diplomacy requires a responsible attitude of both parties to the negotiations and direct de-escalation.

""I don’t see signs right now that Putin is prepared to stop. On the contrary, if you listen to his most recent remarks yesterday, that suggests he is moving in the opposite direction,"" said the U.S. secretary of state.

He also said that Moscow was not making sincere efforts in peace talks with Kyiv, and that President Joe Biden was preparing to issue a warning to China not to send arms to Russia in support of its invasion of Ukraine.

“Yesterday, President Biden said that in his opinion, war crimes have been committed in Ukraine,” Blinken told reporters at the State Department.

“Personally, I agree,” he said.

“Intentionally targeting civilians is a war crime. After all the destruction of the past few weeks, I find it difficult to conclude that the Russians are doing otherwise,” he said.

The chief US diplomat cited the recent bombing of a theater in Mariupol in southern Ukraine where many people had taken refuge and spelled out “children” in large Russian letters on the pavement outside for protection.

He also cited allegations that Russians opened fire on 10 civilians in line to buy bread in Chernihiv.

“With every day that passes the number of civilians, including children, killed and wounded, continues to climb,” he said.

“Russia continues to attack civilian sites, including this week alone, a hospital, three schools (and) a boarding school for visually impaired kids in the Luhansk region of Ukraine.”

He said US experts were now documenting and evaluating reports of attacks on civilians to determine if formal war crimes cases can be made.

“We need to go through this process of compiling the evidence, collecting the evidence, understanding the evidence. We’ll share that, and our allies and partners I’m sure will do the same, with all of the investigations that are ongoing, to support accountability using every tool that we have available,” he said.

Despite optimism from some areas, Blinken cast doubts on ongoing peace discussions between officials from Kyiv and Moscow as the war continues to rage, saying Russia is not negotiating seriously.

“On the one hand, we commend Ukraine for being at the table despite being under bombardment every minute of the day,” Blinken said.

“At the same time, I have not seen any meaningful efforts by Russia to bring this war that it is perpetrating to a conclusion through diplomacy.”

“Diplomacy requires both sides engaging in good faith to de-escalate. I don’t see signs right now that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin is prepared to stop.”

Blinken said that, in a phone discussion planned on Friday with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Biden would press Beijing to help end the war and not support Moscow’s unprovoked invasion.

“We believe China in particular has a responsibility to use its influence with President Putin and to defend the international rules and principles that it professes to support,” Blinken said.

“Instead, it appears that China is moving in the opposite direction.”

He said Washington is concerned China will ship arms to help Russia’s invasion.

In the talks Friday, he said, Biden “will make clear that China will bear responsibility for any actions it takes to support Russia’s aggression. And we will not hesitate to impose costs.”

5,e47f4f67-c5b1-413d-ae03-dab85d299822,[],,"KYIV, Ukraine (AFP) — Bloody new attacks on civilians fuelled accusations Thursday that Russia is committing war crimes in Ukraine, as the United States warned it will make China pay for any support given to Moscow’s assault.

Three weeks into Russia’s devastating invasion, the harsh tally of assaults on civilian targets grew to include a school and a cultural center in the town of Merefa, pounded by overnight artillery fire with 21 people killed, authorities said.

Despite the mounting carnage, punishing international sanctions and unexpectedly strong resistance from Ukrainians, top US diplomat Antony Blinken said Thursday he saw no sign that Russian leader Vladimir Putin “is prepared to stop.”

“Intentionally targeting civilians is a war crime. After all the destruction of the past few weeks, I find it difficult to conclude that the Russians are doing otherwise,” he said, following warnings from the G7 that those behind such crimes “will be held responsible.”

Blinken was doubling down on the tough language used by President Joe Biden — who a day earlier branded Putin a “war criminal” and on Thursday called him both a “thug” and a “murderous dictator.”

He spoke as authorities were still trying to count the dead at the theatre targeted by a bomb in southern Mariupol a day earlier — which Ukraine’s leader Volodymyr Zelensky held up as evidence “Russia has become a terrorist state.”

In the latest of a series of resonant speeches to Western lawmakers, Zelensky told the German parliament that Moscow was building a new Cold War wall across Europe, “between freedom and bondage.”

Russia’s unrelenting onslaught on Mariupol has drawn particular horror.

Local officials say more than 2,000 people have died so far in indiscriminate Chechnya-style shelling of the strategic port, and 80 percent of its housing has been destroyed.

Under new Russian shelling, rescuers were combing through the smoking rubble of the Drama Theatre, where Ukrainian officials said more than 1,000 civilians were sheltering in a basement bomb shelter when it was bombed. Human Rights Watch believes they numbered at least 500.

Among the 30,000 civilians said to have fled Mariupol so far, evacuees said they were forced to melt snow for drinking water and cook food scraps on open fires, with water and power supplies cut off.

“In the streets, there are the bodies of many dead civilians,” Tamara Kavunenko, 58, told AFP after reaching the central city of Zaporizhzhia.

“It’s not Mariupol anymore,” she said. “It is hell.”

US puts China on notice

Biden and NATO have refused to get directly involved in the conflict, fearing an escalation with nuclear-armed Russia that would trigger World War III.

Instead, Biden has successfully marshaled a tight Western alliance against Moscow, piling sanctions on Putin’s regime while giving military support to Ukrainian forces.

But one potentially dangerous outlier looms: China.

Beijing has refused to condemn Moscow, and Washington fears the Chinese could switch to full financial and even military support for Russia, transforming an already explosive transatlantic standoff into a global dispute.

A phone call between Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping is planned for Friday, and Blinken said his boss would press Beijing to help end the war, rather than support its fellow authoritarian ally.

Biden “will make clear that China will bear responsibility for any actions it takes to support Russia’s aggression and we will not hesitate to impose costs,” Blinken said.

The broader economic consequences from the war could cut global growth by “over one percentage point” in the next 12 months, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said.

But Russia’s finance ministry said Thursday it had made interest payments worth $117.2 million on two foreign bonds, avoiding a default for now.

Tear down this wall

With stop-start peace talks ongoing, officials in Kyiv said Russia had agreed to nine humanitarian corridors Thursday for fleeing refugees, including one out of Mariupol.

But Blinken said that Moscow was not sincere, stating: “I have not seen any meaningful efforts by Russia to bring this war that it is perpetrating to a conclusion through diplomacy.”

As the death toll mounts and Russian forces squeeze Kyiv, Zelensky continued his increasingly desperate pleas for more help, particularly for military hardware and a no-fly zone.

He has been making a series of impassioned speeches to lawmakers in Western nations, each one tailor-made by invoking the most stirring moments of their recent histories.

This time, before the German parliament, he drew on a 1987 speech in Berlin by US president Ronald Reagan: “Dear Mr Scholz, tear down this wall,” he implored German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

“It’s not a Berlin Wall — it is a wall in central Europe between freedom and bondage and this wall is growing bigger with every bomb.”

In an overnight video message, Zelensky urged Russians directly to lay down their arms.

“If your war, the war against the Ukrainian people, continues, Russia’s mothers will lose more children than in the Afghan and Chechen wars combined,” he said.

It is hell

The Ukrainian leader was speaking virtually from Kyiv, which Russian troops are still trying to surround in a slow-moving offensive.

Fresh fighting broke out on the city’s edge as Ukrainian and Russian forces traded shell and rocket fire in the northwest, AFP journalists witnessed.

Civilians ran for cover as shelling set fire to a building near a warehouse, across the road from a mall with a multiplex cinema.

Inside the warehouse’s car park, a Ukrainian soldier carrying a rifle ran in a crouch as gunshots crackled.

A man carried a prone child in his arms into a nearby block of flats, and at least five ambulances raced towards the scene.

In Odessa, on the Black Sea, civilians were bracing for attack, with tanks deployed at intersections and monuments covered in sandbags.

“Our beautiful Odessa,” said Lyudmila, an elegant elderly woman wearing bright lipstick, as she looked apologetically at her city’s empty, barricaded streets.

“But thank God we are holding on! Everyone is holding on!”

And elsewhere, civilians in bomb shelters did what they could to help forget the war raging outside — even just for a while.

From her shelter in Ukraine’s second city Kharkiv, Vera Lytovchenko has become a social media sensation with her violin performances and used the attention to launch a fundraiser.

Mendelson', 'Denis Volkov', 'Ania Zolyniak']",,"On the evening of February 23, the members of the UN Security Council gathered in a last-ditch effort to fulfill their obligations as “peace-loving nations.” Around 11:30 p.m. EST, Ukraine’s UN ambassador, Sergiy Kyslytsya, was finally given the floor. Reshuffling his papers, he bewailed that his prepared remarks were now “useless.” “It’s too late...to speak of de-escalation” Kyslytsya lamented, “too late.” While the members sat in their diplomatic round-robin attempting to prevent a ground war in Europe, Russian President Vladimir Putin had announced an invasion of Ukraine.

The meeting did not last much longer, with the UN Security Council president quickly moving through the other representatives’ remarks—the president being none other than Russia’s own “peace-loving” UN ambassador.

Russia’s invasion, taken without provocation, constitutes an unequivocal violation of jus ad bellum—or the law of war; however, Russia’s hostilities do not simply breach international law. One of Putin’s primary motivations has in fact been to poison the very framework of the modern international legal order by maliciously manipulating the application and interpretation of core concepts—including the right to self-defense, the right to self-determination, and the prohibition of genocide—codified precisely to prevent such violence.

The totality and devastation of World War II prompted leaders to establish a framework upon which a more peaceful postwar world could be constructed—one where war was the absolute last resort in settling conflicts between and among states, where the preservation of international law was paramount, and where democratic principles formed the basis of states’ foreign policies. To quote the elegant words of the Red Army’s own colonel of justice, Eugene Korovin, “the process of overcoming [antidemocratic trends], the struggle for their abolition and the affirmation of the principles of democracy in international relations constitute[d] an immediate objective [that united] the progressive elements of contemporary [hu]mankind.”

This vision was manifested in the United Nations and the international system it established. Tenets such as sovereignty, territorial integrity, nonintervention, and self-determination were enshrined in the UN Charter, the authoritative and defining covenant of this new world. The principle of last resort became a central element of jus ad bellum, codified in Chapter VII of the charter, which grants the UN Security Council sole authority to authorize military action, qualified by the right of every member state to individual and collective self-defense under Article 51. The Geneva Conventions (1949) were updated and expanded to limit the horrors of war, and the UN General Assembly’s adoption of the Genocide Convention (1948) evidenced states’ recognition of and commitment to preventing a repeat of World War II’s atrocities.

Putin’s cynical twisting of the core principles underlying the postwar international system and codified in these instruments has been on display from the outset of the current war. In justifying the largest military attack in Europe since World War II, the Russian president invoked Article 51, citing the need to protect the populations of two breakaway Ukrainian regions, the so-called Peoples Republics of Luhansk and Donetsk, where Russia has been arming separatists since 2014. To defend Russia’s blatant violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, Putin explicitly referenced the right to self-determination under Article 1 of the UN Charter, announcing Russia’s official recognition of the regions, despite neither’s ability to satisfy the high international legal burden of achieving statehood through secession. Putin then brazenly used the regions’ invented statuses to buttress his invocation of collective defense under Article 51, cloaking his bellicosity in a façade of legitimacy and ignoring Article 1’s emphasis on promoting “friendly relations among nations.”

Putin’s references to a genocide being perpetrated by Kyiv are even more outlandish. Indeed, it is Moscow’s own aggression, accusations, and actions vis-à-vis the Ukrainian nation and its people that echo the Soviet Union's earlier campaign of genocide in Ukraine from 1932 to 1933. Under Article II parts (a) and (b) of the Genocide Convention, killing or ""causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of” an ethnic group or nation in an attempt to destroy that entity constitutes genocide. While it is perhaps premature to classify Russia’s actions as an attempt to destroy the Ukrainian nation, there is already ample evidence of Russian military attacks on Ukrainian civilians in contravention of international humanitarian law, as well as of potential war crimes including rape, torture, and unlawful confinement committed during the extended conflict in the Donbas. Such violence could be construed as manifesting Putin’s conviction that there is no separate (ethnic) Ukrainian nation.

Putin’s insidious invocations of international law, which have been debunked and refuted by international lawyers of all persuasions, constitute a direct assault on the modern liberal world order from within, through the baseless manipulation of codified international legal precepts. As Russia’s war of choice rages on, so does its attack on the UN Charter system. Even as its forces employ indiscriminate weapons and strike civilian targets in Ukraine, in defiance of the Geneva Convention, its UN ambassador embraces the procedures of the UN Security Council to convene a special meeting to speciously accuse the United States of developing biological weapons in Ukraine, in violation of the Biological Weapons Convention.

In effect, Russia has launched a two-front war—with its military on the ground in Ukraine and through its words and actions in Moscow and New York—against the international system. Moscow’s pernicious perversion of codified postwar legal principles, however, presents the West with a significant opportunity. Despite Russia’s best efforts, proponents of the rules-based international system seem unwilling to throw in the towel just yet. Instead, as Monica Hakimi argues, they are “rallying around the UN Charter,” turning to the procedures, tenets, and resources of the UN system to retaliate against Russian lawlessness.

The United States has responded to Russia’s physical assault with sustained strikes on the Russian economy, as well as more recently promising and delivering lethal assistance. It is now time for the United States to engage on the second front, by reaffirming the international normative and legal architectures that are also under attack.

Ideally, this would include reconsidering the longstanding U.S. aversion to joining core institutions of the UN Charter system committed to the peaceful resolution of international disputes. Ukraine, a nation under fire, has demonstrated its commitment to such institutions, having sought peaceful redress against Russian aggression at the International Court of Justice. Perhaps it’s finally time, then, for the United States to get on board as well. Likewise, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court announced new investigations into potential Russian war crimes in Ukraine. Moscow has decried the investigations by pulling directly from the U.S. playbook, asserting that the court lacks jurisdiction over it as a nonparty to the Rome Statute. Why allow Russia to cite the United States as a precedent when the latter could instead serve as an exemplar of the system it is fighting to save with sanctions and export controls?

A credible U.S. defense of the international legal order would also involve coming fully in compliance with the terms of treaties to which the United States is a party, including the Chemical Weapons Convention, and revisiting the logic of refusing to ratify international agreements aimed at limiting the horrors of conflict currently playing out in Europe (e.g., the Convention on Cluster Munitions).

The world’s failure to prevent Russia’s invasion has prompted some observers to dismiss the United Nations and international law as “irrelevant.” The valiant demonstrations of global solidarity with Ukraine, in accordance with international legal principles, however, suggest otherwise. Washington has led the way thus far. The long-term credibility of U.S. global leadership, however, will require a more unalloyed commitment to the very rules the United States is now seeking to defend.",https://www.cfr.org/blog/putins-two-front-war

What You Need To Know Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday accused Vladimir Putin of committing war crimes and using terror tactics while suggesting the Russian leader might be planning to deploy chemical weapons in Ukraine



In a news briefing in Washington, Blinken said he agrees with President Joe Biden’s assessment Wednesday that Putin is a war criminal for leading Russia’s assault on Ukraine



Blinken said U.S. officials are “documenting and evaluating potential war crimes being committed in Ukraine""



Blinken listed Russian actions that U.S. intelligence officials “have a strong sense” could be next, including the use of chemical weapons

In a news briefing in Washington, Blinken said he agrees with President Joe Biden’s assessment Wednesday that Putin is a war criminal for leading Russia’s assault on Ukraine, which has led to at least 780 civilian deaths, according to the United Nations.

“Intentionally targeting civilians is a war crime. After all the destruction of the past three weeks, I find it difficult to conclude that the Russians are doing otherwise,” said Blinken, who cited attacks on a maternity hospital last week in Mariupol, a theater being used as a civilian shelter Wednesday in Mariupol and a bread line Wednesday in Chernihiv.

Blinken said U.S. officials are “documenting and evaluating potential war crimes being committed in Ukraine.”

“We'll make sure that our findings help international efforts to investigate war crimes and hold those responsible accountable,” he said.

Just as he did in a speech to the United Nations Security Council shortly before the war broke out, Blinken listed Russian actions that U.S. intelligence officials “have a strong sense” could be next.

The secretary of state said the U.S. believes “Moscow may be setting the stage to use a chemical weapon and then falsely blame Ukraine to justify escalating its attacks on the Ukrainian people.” It’s a strategy Russia previously used in Georgia, Blinken said.

He also said Russia might bring mercenaries from private military groups in foreign countries to fight in Ukraine.

And Blinken also said Moscow is “likely to systematically kidnap local officials and replace them with puppets,” which he called a “terror tactic.”

Last week, two Ukrainian mayors — Melitopol’s Ivan Fedorov and Dniprorudne’s Yevhen Matveyev — were abducted by Russian soldiers.

Fedorov was freed Wednesday — a Ukrainian news agency, quoting a senior official, reported that he was swapped for nine Russian prisoners. Matveyev has not be let go.

Meanwhile, Blinken said, the U.S. is focused on trying to end the war by providing military aid, supporting diplomatic efforts and imposing sanctions. While he commended Ukraine for continuing to hold talks with Kremlin officials, he said he has not “seen any meaningful efforts by Russia to bring this war that it’s perpetrating to a conclusion through diplomacy.”

Blinken also paid his respects to journalists who were killed or wounded in Ukraine over the past week, including Fox News correspondent Benjamin Hall, who was injured Monday when the vehicle he was traveling in came under fire outside of Kyiv. The secretary of state said he has gotten to know Hall, 39, when he’s been a member of the traveling press corps.

“He's an incredibly talented reporter, always asking tough questions,” Blinken said. “He's a lovely person as well. Our thoughts, my thoughts are with him and his family, including his three little kids.”

Two other journalists working for Fox were killed in the same attack: cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski, 55, and Oleksandra ""Sasha"" Kuvshynova, a 24-year-old Ukrainian consultant who was helping the crew navigate the region. Blinken acknowledged them, as well as Brent Renaud, a filmmaker and journalist on assignment for Time magazine, who was fatally shot Sunday in the Kyiv suburb of Irpin.

“Being a war correspondent is vital work,” Blinken said. “They make sure that the world knows what's really happening when armies move in and bombs start falling. It also takes incredible courage.”

Blinken also confirmed another American citizen has been killed in Ukraine, but he did not provide any details.",https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2022/03/17/blinken-also-calls-putin-a-war-criminal--suggests-russia-could-be-plotting-chemical-attacks

He also said that Moscow was not making sincere efforts in peace talks with Kyiv, and that President Joe Biden was preparing to issue a warning to China not to send arms to Russia in support of its invasion of Ukraine.

""Yesterday, President Biden said that in his opinion, war crimes have been committed in Ukraine,"" Mr Blinken told reporters at the State Department.

""Personally, I agree,"" he said.

""Intentionally targeting civilians is a war crime. After all the destruction of the past few weeks, I find it difficult to conclude that the Russians are doing otherwise,"" he said.

The chief US diplomat cited the recent bombing of a theatre in Mariupol in southern Ukraine where many people had taken refuge and spelled out ""children"" in large Russian letters on the pavement outside for protection.

He also cited allegations that Russians opened fire on 10 civilians in line to buy bread in Chernihiv.

""With every day that passes, the number of civilians, including children, killed and wounded, continues to climb,"" he said.

""Russia continues to attack civilian sites, including this week alone, a hospital, three schools (and) a boarding school for visually impaired kids in the Luhansk region of Ukraine.""

He said United States experts were now documenting and evaluating reports of attacks on civilians to determine if formal war crimes cases can be made.

""We need to go through this process of compiling the evidence, collecting the evidence, understanding the evidence. We'll share that, and our allies and partners I'm sure will do the same, with all of the investigations that are ongoing, to support accountability using every tool that we have available,"" he said.

Despite optimism from some areas, Mr Blinken cast doubts on ongoing peace discussions between officials from Kyiv and Moscow as the war continues to rage, saying Russia is not negotiating seriously.

""On the one hand, we commend Ukraine for being at the table despite being under bombardment every minute of the day,"" Mr Blinken said.

""At the same time, I have not seen any meaningful efforts by Russia to bring this war that it is perpetrating to a conclusion through diplomacy.""",https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/blinken-russian-attacks-on-civilians-in-ukraine-a-war-crime
