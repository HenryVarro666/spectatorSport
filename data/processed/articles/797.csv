2,ff3eb969-9edd-466b-8ca2-5d22118335fa,[],,"Interior Minister Ayelet Shaked ordered on Thursday to transfer Ukrainian refugees from Ben-Gurion International Airport, where they have been staying, to a hotel until a decision on their status is made.

According to data from the population authority, there are 25 refugees at the airport who have been denied entry into Israel. Of these, 15 are expected to fly back to Ukraine on Thursday night, five appealed the decision to reject their entry and the rest are waiting for their relatives to provide them with the necessary funds for a deposit which will allow them entry.

The director of Ben-Gurion Airport, Shmuel Zakai, said Thursday during a meeting of the Knesset Committee for Immigration, Absorption and Diaspora Affairs that dozens of refugees are currently waiting in the airport. ""I can't watch mothers not shower for three days and sleep on mats with their children,"" he added.

During the meeting, Aliyah and Integration Minister Pnina Tamano-Shata said: ""As the State of Israel, we cannot allow the scenes occurring at the airport. It can't be that that Jews will receive food and non-Jews won't. If the Interior Ministry won‚Äôt take care of that, then we will.""

Tamano-Shata ordered her ministry's employees at the airport to provide food and water to the refugees in the terminal, even though the issue does not fall under her ministry's authority.

Another issue that arose during the meeting was health insurance for refugees. The government is exploring ways to provide health insurance, Haaretz has learned. One suggestion during the meeting was to have the Jewish Agency provide health insurance. The Health Ministry shot this idea down, and the issue was passed on to the director-generals of the Prime Minister's Office and the Health Ministry, as well as Finance Ministry officials.",https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/LIVE-live-updates-hospitals-take-hit-as-russian-forces-bolster-siege-of-ukrainian-cities-1.10665437

Thousands of others, unable to find safe passage or not sure they want to leave Kharkiv, are living permanently in shelters like the subway station.

Station staff estimate that between 1,000 and 3,000 people stay in the station each day, down from more than 5,000 people a week ago, since many have managed to flee. Some have lived in these conditions since the first day of the war.

‚ÄúAnything is better than sleeping at home with bombs,‚Äù said Ina, one of the involuntary underground residents. (She declined to give her full name out of security concerns.) ‚ÄúThe conditions here are very bad. We wouldn‚Äôt be here if we weren‚Äôt very scared.‚Äù Ina is sheltering alone with her two young children.

With few trappings of comfort, people sleep on cold marble floors in every foot of space, from locker rooms to hallways. Entire families have set up tiny temporary homes in stationary train cars. It‚Äôs claustrophobic, the air is thick, and it smells of sweat. It feels like a tomb for the thankfully not yet dead.







Hundreds of people use each bathroom, with a table set up on one side to hold their food and toiletries: Milk and cookies sit next to soap and shampoo. People look exhausted, and paranoia is rampant. I am accused of being a Russian saboteur at least three times.

Just over two weeks since Russia invaded Ukraine, Western officials are warning that Kharkiv could soon be encircled. Hundreds of people have already been killed out of the city‚Äôs pre-war population of 1.4 million, but Russia seems determined to grind on. Russian state media has claimed Ukraine is operating U.S.-backed chemical and biological weapons laboratories in Kharkiv, a claim amplified by Russian diplomats at the United Nations and Chinese diplomats abroad. Western officials warn it could mean Russia is about to use ‚Äúunconventional weapons.‚Äù

Russian attempts to quickly seize the capital and major cities were met with an unexpectedly solid Ukrainian resistance. Russia‚Äôs solution appears to be the tactic it already perfected in Chechnya and Syria: raining wholesale destruction on besieged cities. Mariupol, a key export hub in southern Ukraine, has been mauled by deliberate Russian strikes, including attacks on maternity hospitals.

Kharkiv has been hit with particular cruelty. Street after street has been destroyed, pockmarked with craters and covered with rubble and twisted steel. Residential neighborhoods and its historic downtown have been targeted, and at least 48 schools have been destroyed. A residential home for the disabled was hit by an airstrike on Friday while at least 400 high-rise apartment buildings have been hammered. Residents are left with no heating in sub-zero temperatures amid relentless shelling and missile strikes, according to Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov.

In Kharkiv, like much of the eastern Donbass region, most people speak Russian, and many previously had sympathy for Moscow. The cruelty is hard for them to fathom. Moscow denies it has targeted civilians. Instead, Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a special operation to ‚Äúde-Nazify‚Äù the country.







‚ÄúThe other night, Nikolsky shopping mall was destroyed,‚Äù said Ivan, a handyman at the subway station who is now volunteering to help people who live there. ‚ÄúThere were so many beautiful places in this city, but Russia ruined everything. I drive through the city, and I can‚Äôt recognize it anymore. It‚Äôs so painful to see.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy family wants to leave Kharkiv,‚Äù Ivan added, who also asked to withhold his last name out of fear of reprisals. ‚ÄúMy girlfriend also tells me to leave. We have relatives in the west of Ukraine, but I don‚Äôt want to leave my station.‚Äù

With few businesses open and few people going to work, volunteer units have mobilized in the days since the war started. Teams like Volunteer Dnipra‚Äîwhich has already set up a 200-vehicle-strong fleet‚Äîshuttle in from relatively safer cities like Dnipro, well to the west of Kharkiv, to bring in supplies and take out evacuees.

Ukrainians cling to hope that the international community can help bring a solution to the war. But diplomatic off-ramps seem hard to find. On Thursday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, failed to reach a cease-fire agreement.

For those living in dark, dusty, squalid basements and subways, each day that passes means a little less dignity to their living conditions and a lot more resolve.

‚ÄúDown here, we try not to talk about outside and instead concentrate on living,‚Äù Ina said. ‚ÄúBut we can‚Äôt help but ask, ‚ÄòHow can something this bad happen in the modern world?‚Äô We just can‚Äôt understand it.‚Äù",https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/03/11/life-underground-kharkiv-ukraine-russia/

In last night's televised address to the nation, Zelensky sarcastically addressed Russian troops and asked where they planned to deploy chemical weapons.

'Where will you strike with chemical weapons?' he asked. 'At the maternity hospital in Mariupol? At the church in Kharkiv? Okhmadit children's hospital? Or at our laboratories, which have been around since Soviet times and work on regular technology, not military technology?'

The embattled president also announced civilians were evacuated from the cities of Sumy, Trostyanets, Krasnopillya, Irpin, Bucha, Hostomel and Izyum despite constant shelling, but Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said not a single civilian was able to leave Mariupol on Thursday as Russian forces failed to respect yet another temporary ceasefire.

The constant bombardment of the southern port city, which has been without water and electricity for close to a fortnight due to Russia's refusal to respect ceasefires, was described by Zelensky as 'outright terror, from experienced terrorists'.

'The invaders launched a tank attack exactly where this 'corridor of life' was supposed to be. They have a clear order to hold the city of Mariupol hostage, to torture it,' he said.

There was also widespread destruction elsewhere in Ukraine as the invaders continued their indiscriminate bombardment of civilian targets.

The Institute of Physics and Technology in Kharkiv (KIPT) and a high-pressure gas pipeline near Svitlodarsk are two of the latest locations to be decimated in the attacks as the Russian invasion of Ukraine entered its third week.

KIPT was first attacked by Russian bombing campaigns on Monday, but footage has emerged of a new blaze at the complex's dormitories today after the institute's neutron source was destroyed in what Ukraine's Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate called 'an act of nuclear terrorism'.

The newly built neutron source, which is used to initiate nuclear chain reactions among other applications, was set to play a key role in nuclear physics and radiological materials research.

According to the Inspectorate, the device had been loaded with 'fresh nuclear fuel' just prior to the Russian bombardment, and there were fears the shelling of the research facility could pose a threat of nuclear disaster. The Inspectorate said it had not yet ascertained the extent of the damage done to the facility, nor the number of casualties.

But the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said no radiation had been released and that staff had placed the assembly into a 'subcritical state' prior to the attacks, while Harvard nuclear proliferation researcher Matthew Bunn told Physics Today that the facility generates 'virtually zero fission products' with no highly enriched uranium onsite.

Nikolsky mall, a large shopping and entertainment complex in Kharkiv's city centre, was also reduced to rubble in shelling on Thursday morning.

Meanwhile, a video taken on the outskirts of the eastern city of Svitlodarsk in the Donetsk region purported to show Russian troops destroying a high-pressure gas pipeline, sending huge jets of flame into the sky.

Pavlo Kyrylenko, the regional governor of Donetsk, published the video on his Telegram channel, confirming the Russian attack which took place at 4pm GMT.

'The Russians have just broken a high-pressure gas pipeline near Svitlodarsk,' Kyrylenko said.

'How the damaged gas pipeline is burning can be seen from afar. Gas workers will soon find out how quickly they can restore it.'

Russia's defence ministry said late Thursday that it would declare a ceasefire on Friday and open humanitarian corridors from Mariupol as well as Kyiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Mariupol and Chernihiv, but has gone on to break all previous ceasefire agreements and resume shelling of fleeing refugees.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has so far failed to reach its stated objectives, but has caused thousands of deaths and forced more than 2 million people to flee Ukraine in just three weeks.

Large groups of civilians were evacuated from the cities of Sumy, Trostyanets, Krasnopillya, Irpin, Bucha, Hostomel and Izyum despite constant shelling, but not a single civilian was able to leave Mariupol on Thursday as Russian forces failed to respect yet another temporary ceasefire. Zelensky described the move as 'outright terror, from experienced terrorists'. 'The invaders launched a tank attack exactly where this 'corridor of life' was supposed to be. They have a clear order to hold the city of Mariupol hostage, to torture it,' he said.

KIPT is Ukraine's foremost physical science research centre and has long been a hub of scientific and nuclear advancement, contributing greatly to the development of nuclear technology in the Soviet Union.

The Inspectorate released a statement today detailing the fallout of the attack: 'According to preliminary information, the neutron source is completely de-energised. Information on the consequences of the damage is currently being gathered by facility staff.

'The neutron source was already bombed on March 6, as a result of which the following losses were inflicted. Completely destroyed substation; damaged cables of air conditioner cooling systems of the linear electron accelerator; damage to the main building of the installation; damaged heating main to the complex of buildings.'

In Svitlodarsk, it was not immediately clear what regions of Ukraine are supplied by the gas pipeline, but a similar pipeline in the Donetsk region was attacked by Russian forces on Sunday, which cut off supply to a 70-mile stretch of towns in southeastern Ukraine, Kyrylenko said.

Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and former head of MI6's Russian operations Christopher Steele echoed Zelensky's concerns that Russia could soon deploy chemical weapons amid slow progress on the ground.

The Prime Minister said Putin is in charge of a 'cynical, barbaric government', and believes Russia is preparing a 'fake story' which it could use to deny using the weapons and to blame the West.

The Prime Minister told Sky News‚Äô Beth Rigby Interviews show: ‚ÄòThe stuff that you are hearing about chemical weapons, this is straight out of their playbook.

‚ÄòThey start saying that there are chemical weapons that have been stored by their opponents or by the Americans and so when they themselves deploy chemical weapons, as I fear they may, they have a sort of maskirovka, a fake story, ready to go. And you have seen it in Syria. You saw it even in the UK.‚Äô

Boris Johnson today said he fears Vladimir Putin will use chemical weapons in Ukraine because it would be 'straight out of Russia's playbook'. He made the comments to Sky News‚Äô Beth Rigby Interviews show

Steele said that although Putin had 'grossly miscalculated' the invasion and that his regime would not survive over the long term as oligarchs and regular citizens alike begin to feel the pinch of sanctions, the Russian leader would likely step up the violence in the short term.

'As the Russian army becomes bogged down, more desperate, and clearly not realising its objectives militarily, you're likely to see more indiscriminate killing and bombardment and possibly the use of a [chemical] weapon,' Steele said.



Elsewhere, Russia continued its utterly brutal bombardment of southern port city Mariupol, one day after an airstrike landed a direct hit on a maternity hospital which resulted in three deaths and at least 17 other casualties.



There has been no relief for the people of Mariupol, which has now been under bombardment for close to a fortnight and is largely cut off from water, electricity and humanitarian aid.

Mortuary workers were pictured yesterday putting corpses in body bags or carpets, taking them to the outskirts of the besieged port city, and then dumping them in mass graves.

The Mariupol city council posted a video Thursday showing buses driving down a highway, saying a convoy bringing food and medicine was trying to reach the city and would evacuate civilians during the return leg.

Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said yesterday that 1,300 civilians had been killed in Mariupol and that Russian forces start shelling the city each time a humanitarian convoy tries to head there to evacuate its residents.

'They want to destroy the people of Mariupol, they want to make them starve,' she said. 'It's a war crime.'

Four previous attempts to bring relief to the city have failed, after Ukraine said Russia shelled the route it was intending to use.

Bombs also fell on two hospitals in Zhytomyr west of the capital on Thursday morning, the mayor said, as Russian forces intensified their siege of Ukrainian cities.

A video appeared to show a Russian plane screaming over the northwestern city and letting loose more bombs on the Berdichevsky bridge.

Meanwhile, Russia yesterday admitted its forces had deployed a thermobaric 'vacuum bomb' in the city of Chernihiv, confirming widespread reports that the devastating weapon had been used on civilian targets.

Britain's Ministry of Defense said on Tuesday that Moscow had announced the use of the 'lung-busting' weapons, but the report was validated yesterday morning when Ukrainian newspaper Ukrayinska Pravda said that a Russian artilleryman, Sgt. Sergei Gubarev, had told a state-owned TV station he had used the weapon.

Their information came from a report broadcast on Zvezda - a Russian state-owned nationwide television network run by the Russian Ministry of Defense.

Chernihiv, 80 miles north of Kyiv, is one of many cities that has been under heavy bombardment.

The Soviet-era weapon launches rockets from atop a tank body that suck in surrounding oxygen, creating higher temperatures and more damaging explosions that last longer than conventional blasts.

Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said yesterday that Ukraine's capital city has been 'turned into a fortress' ahead of the Russian assault, with about 2 million people - half the residents of the metro area of the capital - having fled as Putin's troops draw ever closer.

'Every street, every house is being fortified, the territorial defence is joining,' Klitschko said in a televised interview today.

'Even people who in their lives never intended to change their clothes, now they are in uniform with machine guns in their hands.'

The battle for Kyiv is now underway as Russian tanks pushed to within just a few miles of the city outskirts yesterday morning, though initial assaults to the west and east were repelled as Putin's forces face a long and bloody campaign to try and take the capital.

Kremlin troops launched two attacks on Kyiv late Wednesday and early Thursday - one via the besieged western city of Irpin and another through the eastern district of Brovary, with video showing the moment Russian tanks and armoured vehicles were bombarded with artillery in a devastating ambush and forced to turn back.

Colonel Andrei Zakharov, commander of the tank regiment, was also killed in the ambush according to the Ukrainian defence ministry and radio chatter intercepted from Russians on the battlefield. The same transmissions suggested the column suffered heavy losses, with one tank and an armoured vehicle destroyed.

It marks just the latest Russian commander to be killed in Ukraine, after two generals were slain by Kyiv's troops. Colonel Zakharov had been awarded the Order of Courage by Vladimir Putin in 2016.

Satellite imagery released earlier today appeared to show that the 40-mile-long convoy of Russian armour, which has been backed up outside of Kyiv for over a week, has now dispersed and redeployed in what look to be firing positions, suggesting that a larger assault on the capital is imminent.

Tanks, artillery and other armoured units were seen in towns near the Antonov Airport north of the city, while other vehicles have moved into forests on the capital's outskirts, according to satellite operator Maxar Technologies.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10600151/Zelensky-warns-threat-Russia-deploying-chemical-weapons-real.html
5,ff3eb969-9edd-466b-8ca2-5d22118335fa,[],,"WASHINGTON: Ukraine‚Äôs top government economic adviser Oleg Ustenko said yesterday that invading Russian forces have so far destroyed at least $100 billion worth of infrastructure, buildings and other physical assets.

Ustenko, chief economic adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, told an online event hosted by the Peterson Institute for International Economics that the war has caused 50 per cent of Ukrainian businesses to shut down completely, while the other half are operating at well below their capacity.

He said the damage estimate is ‚Äúvery approximate‚Äù and includes roads, bridges, hospitals, equipment and other assets.

Asked how such a reconstruction effort could be financed, Ustenko said part of it could come from Russian assets that are frozen throughout the world, including Russian central bank assets held outside the country and immobilized by Western sanctions. The seized assets of wealthy Russian oligarchs could also be transferred to a reconstruction fund, he added.

Asked about the resilience of Ukraine‚Äôs financial system, and bank payment operations, Ustenko said: ‚ÄúLook, we are doing, I would say, OK under the current circumstances.‚Äù

He said Ukraine‚Äôs fiscal reserves are currently at about $27.5bn, down from about $30bn before the invasion.

Despite some pressure on the hryvnia currency, Ukrainians in areas not occupied by Russian forces are able to access cash via ATMs and supermarket cashiers without the long lines seen in the first two days of the war, and credit card and other electronic payment systems are working normally, he added.
