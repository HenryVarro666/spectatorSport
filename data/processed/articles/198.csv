Ukraine has repeatedly called for Western powers to implement a no-fly zone to reduce the Russian military’s ability to attack Ukrainian targets from the air.

But speaking Friday following a meeting of NATO foreign ministers, Stoltenberg said the issue “was mentioned” but that “allies agree that we should not have NATO planes operating over Ukrainian airspace or NATO troops on Ukrainian territory.”

The secretary-general — who also warned that fighting in the coming days in Ukraine is likely to get worse — said that a no-fly zone would trigger a broader conflict.

“The only way to implement a no-fly zone is to send NATO planes — fighter planes — into Ukrainian airspace, and then impose that no-fly zone by shooting down Russian planes,” Stoltenberg said. “If we did that, we’ll end up with something that could end in a full-fledged war in Europe involving many more countries and causing much more human suffering.”

“So that’s the reason why we made this painful decision to impose heavy sanctions, provide significant support — stepping up support — but at the same time not involving NATO forces directly in the conflict in Ukraine,” Stoltenberg added.",https://www.politico.eu/article/nato-wont-establish-no-fly-zone-over-ukraine-jens-stoltenberg-says/

NATO warns the worst is yet to come in Russia's war on Ukraine

BRUSSELS, March 4 (Reuters) - NATO on Friday rejected Ukrainian calls to help it protect its skies from Russian missiles and warplanes, wary of being dragged into Moscow's war on its neighbour, but Europe promised more sanctions to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy strongly criticised the decision, saying the alliance had given Russia the green light to continue its bombing campaign.

He had earlier appealed to NATO to set up a no-fly zone over Ukraine, which Russia invaded by land, sea and air on Feb. 24.

""We are not part of this conflict,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in denying Ukraine's request.

""We have a responsibility as NATO allies to prevent this war from escalating beyond Ukraine because that would be even more dangerous, more devastating and would cause even more human suffering,"" he said following a NATO meeting in Brussels.

Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, wants to join the European Union and NATO, moves which Moscow says threaten its security and influence. Russia has shelled residential areas and civilian infrastructure, as well as capturing two nuclear sites. read more

""Today there was a NATO summit, a weak summit, a confused summit, a summit where it was clear that not everyone considers the battle for Europe's freedom to be the number one goal,"" Zelenskiy said a televised address late on Friday.

""Today, the leadership of the alliance gave the green light for further bombing of Ukrainian cities and villages, having refused to set up a no-fly zone.""

While the West condemned Putin, members of the 30-strong NATO are bound to defend each other in case of attack and wary of sinking into a war with nuclear-armed Russia. The EU threatened more sanctions but it was not clear what it could do.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the alliance would defend ""every inch"" of NATO territory and that Moscow should not doubt Washington's resolve.

""Ours is a defensive alliance. We seek no conflict. But if conflict comes to us, we are ready,"" he said.

""We'll continue to raise the cost for President Putin. Unless the Kremlin changes course, it will continue down the road of increasing isolation and economic pain.""

But the alliance - in which the United States, Britain and France are also nuclear powers - dashed Ukraine's hopes of immediate help Kyiv says could turn the tables in the war.

""We should not have NATO planes operating over Ukrainian airspace or NATO troops operating in Ukrainian territory,"" Stoltenberg said.

MORE DEATHS, MORE SANCTIONS

Support for Ukraine so far has come in the form of the heaviest international economic sanctions against Russia to date, as well as arms supplies from NATO states.

On Friday, the West promised Ukraine more humanitarian aid, essential supplies and military support short of going to war.

In a day of intense diplomacy - if no obvious immediate results - the G7 countries said they would hold accountable those responsible for war crimes and refuse to recognise any Russian territorial gains.

EU countries said more punishment was coming, after the bloc already cut several Russian lenders from the SWIFT banking system, curbed trade with Moscow and targeted some of the wealth held by Russian oligarchs in the West.

The EU was looking at curbing Russia's access to the International Monetary Fund, officials said. read more

""It's Putin's war, and only Putin can end it,"" the top EU diplomat, Josep Borrell, said. ""If someone expects that sanctions can stop the war tomorrow, they don't know what they're talking about.""

Ukraine called on the West to freeze out all Russian banks. But it was not clear when and what more sanctions the EU could agree, given its reliance on Russian energy supplies, which think tank Eurointelligence said amount to $700 million daily.

Stoltenberg said the worst was yet to come as Russia was rolling out more heavy arms.

""The days to come are likely to be worse, with more deaths, more suffering and more destruction,"" he said.

Zelenskyy blames NATO for 'the green light for further bombing of Ukraine'

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy slammed NATO for its decision not to implement a no-fly zone over Ukraine.

""Knowing that new strikes and casualties are inevitable, NATO deliberately decided not to close the sky over Ukraine,"" Zelenskyy said in a video published by the presidency.

Earlier, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg's warned the conflict in Ukraine would probably worsen in the coming days. The alliance decided its planes should not operate over Ukrainian airspace.

""We understand the desperation but we also believe that if we did that (establishing a no-fly zone) we would end up with something that could lead to a fully-fledged war in Europe, involving much more countries,"" Stoltenberg.

But Zelenskyy insisted that the NATO gathering was a ""weak summit, a confused summit.""

""All the people who die starting today will also die because of you. Because of your weakness, because of your disconnection,"" he said.

""Today the leadership of the alliance gave the green light for further bombing of Ukrainian cities and villages, refusing to make a no-fly zone.""

CNN, CBC and Bloomberg suspends operations in Russia's

Several international news organizations suspended their operations in Russia after President Vladimir Putin signed a law that introduced jail terms of up to 15 years for people publishing ""fake news.""

""CNN will stop broadcasting in Russia while we continue to evaluate the situation and our next steps moving forward,"" a spokesperson said.

Meanwhile, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation had temporarily suspended its reporting from the country.

""The CBC is very concerned about new legislation passed in Russia, which appears to criminalize independent reporting on the current situation in Ukraine and Russia,"" it said in a statement posted online.

Bloomberg News said it was also ""temporarily suspend the work of its journalists""

""The change to the criminal code, which seems designed to turn any independent reporter into a criminal purely by association, makes it impossible to continue any semblance of normal journalism inside the country,"" Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait said.

Putin signs 'fake news' law introducing 15-years jail term

Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law imposing harsh jail terms for publishing ""fake news"" about his invasion of Ukraine.

People face term terms of up to 15 years for spreading information that goes against the Kremlin's position on the war in Ukraine.

Russia to impose jail terms, fines for ""fake news""

State media outlets refer to Russia's invasion of Ukraine as a ""special military operation"" rather than war or an invasion.

The bill prescribes sentences of up to three years or fines for ""false"" information about the military and for people who publicly call for sanctions against Russia.

Courts would mete out the maximum punishment of 15 years for news that leads to ""serious consequences.""

Russia restricts access to Twitter

Russia's communications regulator on Friday announced that it would block access to Twitter.

Roskomnadzor announcement followed after it blocked Meta platforms, including Facebook, blaming it for restricting Kremlin-controlled media on its platforms.

Also Friday, Russia banned five foreign media organizations, including DW, which publish news in Russian in a sweeping action to establish tight control over information about the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

US has 'no strategic interest' in sanctions that could reduce global energy supply

The United States is considering additional sanctions against Russia, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken told reporters.

Asked whether it would include energy sanctions, he said, ""nothing is off the table.""

He added, however, that cutting the global supply of energy would raise prices ""at the pumps for Americans"" and ""pad Russian profits with rising prices.""

""There is no strategic interest in reducing the global supply of energy,"" Blinken said in Brussels.

In Washington, the White House economic adviser, Cecilia Rouse, said the US was looking at options if it were to decide to cut consumption of Russian energy.

""What's really most important is that we maintain (a) steady supply of global energy,"" Rouse told reporters.

Russia blocks Facebook

Russia has blocked Meta Platforms, including Facebook, inside the country.

The state media regulator, Roskomnadzor, said there had been 26 cases of ""discrimination"" against Russian media since October 2020, with access restricted to state-backed channels like RT and the RIA news agency.

Meta said it will do anything it can to restore the service.

A number of international news websites, including DW, the BBC and Meduza, are also no longer accessible in Russia.

On Thursday, one of Russia's last independent news outlets, TV Rain, stopped broadcasting after coming under pressure for its coverage of the invasion.

They welcomed the investigations and evidence-gathering by the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court.

""Russia must immediately stop its ongoing assault against Ukraine, which has dramatically impacted the civilian population and destroyed civilian infrastructure, and immediately withdraw Russia's military forces,"" the ministers added.

Ukraine's president addresses anti-war demonstrators

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a video address to anti-war protesters in several European cities. He started by dedicating two separate moments of silence for the fallen soldiers and civilians in the conflict.

Rallying support for the Ukrainian cause, he then asked for a third moment of silence for the people of Europe. In a passionate plea, he urged Europeans to come out onto the streets and support Ukraine's fight.

""If Ukraine will not stand, Europe will not stand. If we fall, you will fall. So please don’t be silent. Do not turn a blind eye to this,"" he said.

""And if we win, and I'm sure we'll win, this will be the victory of the whole democratic world, this will be the victory of our freedom, this will be the victory of light over darkness, of freedom over slavery.

""And if we win we will become as blossoming as Europe. And Europe will be flourishing more than ever,'' he said. ""All of you are Ukrainians today, thank you for this.""

US envoy condemns 'reckless' nuclear plant attack

US ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told the UN Security Council in an emergency meeting that Russia's ""reckless"" attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant endangered all of Europe.

""By the grace of God, the world narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe last night,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. ""It was incredibly reckless and dangerous. And it threatened the safety of civilians across Russia, Ukraine and Europe,"" she added.

But Moscow's UN ambassador denied the accusations. ""These statements are simply untrue,"" Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council. ""This is all part of an unprecedented campaign of lies and disinformation against Russia,"" he said.

Nebenzia argued that Russian troops had exchanged small arms fire with Ukrainian forces at the power plant, but that they had not deliberately shelled the facility.

Georgia 'very worried' it could become Russia's 'next target'

Nikoloz Samkharadze, chair of the foreign relations committee of the Georgian parliament, told DW that his country was ""very worried"" it ""could become the next target for Russian aggression.""

Georgia formally applied to join the European Union on Thursday. Like Ukraine, Georgia is a direct neighbor of Russia. A majority of Georgians support joining the EU, but the process normally takes up to a decade.

Samkharadze said the timing of the move was due to the situation in the region changing ""drastically"" with Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""We also see that there is a certain change in the mindset of some of the European leaders.... all of them have realized that the security of the European Union is pretty much dependent on the security in the Black Sea region,"" he said.

UN rights body backs violations probe

The United Nations' Human Rights Council voted overwhelmingly on Friday to back a resolution condemning alleged human rights violations by Russia as its invasion of Ukraine entered its ninth day. The rights body has also set up an inquiry to probe the subject further.

Thirty-two members of the Council voted in favor of the resolution brought by Ukraine, and two — Russia and Eritrea — voted against, while 13 abstained.

The rights organization cannot make legally binding decisions but its decisions send important messages and can authorize probes, such as the one to be carried out by the three-person commission created by Friday's vote.

Ukraine's ambassador to the UN in Geneva, Yevheniia Filipenko, told the council minutes before the vote that there was ""irrefutable evidence of gross and systematic human rights violations as well as war crimes and crimes against humanity by Russia.""

""It is our common duty to ensure accountability by mandating the documentation and verification of Russia's crimes and identification of those responsible,"" she said.

Ukraine said emergency services were able to access the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant where a training facility on the site's exterior caught fire following Russian shelling.

Both the IAEA and the White House said they were actively monitoring the attack on Europe's largest nuclear plant and that there has not been an increase in radiation levels.

Ukrainian Embassy in Berlin requests tanks and warships

The Ukrainian Embassy in Berlin has requested the German government provide Kyiv with tanks and warships to face down a Russian invasion.

Additional items on Ukraine's list of requests include infantry fighting vehicles, artillery systems, such as self-propelled howitzers, air defense systems, combat and support helicopters, reconnaissance and combat drones and transport aircraft.

Ukraine's formal request to the Chancellery, the Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry read in part, ""In view of the extremely tense security situation because of the ongoing Russian aggression, the Ukrainian government is seeking that this request be processed and favorably reviewed as quickly as possible.""

The note adds Putin started a ""war of annihilation"" against Ukraine.

Berlin reversed its defense and Russia policy of many decades seemingly overnight following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Germany has already provided 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger surface-to-air missiles after initially promising just 5,000 helmets.

Zelenskyy: 'Europe needs to wake up'

""Europe needs to wake up,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video posted to Telegram after Russian troops shelled the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant.

""I am addressing all Ukrainians, all Europeans and everyone who knows the word Chernobyl,"" he said. ""Tens of thousands had to be evacuated and Russia wants to repeat that, and is already repeating it, but six times bigger.""

He added that Ukraine has 15 nuclear reactors and ""if there is an explosion it is the end for everyone.""

""Do not let Europe die in the nuclear catastrophe,"" he concluded.

Johnson said Putin could ""threaten the safety of all of Europe.""

China-backed bank suspends business with Russia, Belarus

The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) said it will be suspending business with Russia and Belarus, which have been hit by severe international sanctions since Russia invaded Ukraine. Belarus has provided Moscow with assistance and logistical support, including the use of its territory to mount the assault.

""In the best interests of the bank, management has decided that all activities relating to Russia and Belarus are on hold and under review,"" the bank said in a statement, adding that management would do its ""utmost to safeguard the financial integrity of AIIB.""

""AIIB stands ready to extend financing flexibly and quickly and support members who have been adversely impacted by the war,"" the statement added without much detail.

The AIIB is a multilateral institution launched in 2016 at the initiative of Chinese President Xi Jinping to balance Western dominance of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Russia is one of the founding members of the AIIB, holding a 6% vote in operations and has a seat on the board of the bank. The Bank of China holds a 27% stake, though Russia is the third-largest stakeholder after India.

Biden and Zelenskyy speak about Zaporizhzhia fire

US President Joe Biden spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about the fire that broke out at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant following Russian shelling, the White House said in a series of tweets.

The White House wrote that Biden ""joined President Zelenskyy in urging Russia to cease its military activities in the area and allow firefighters and emergency responders to access the site.""

The White House added that Biden ""also spoke this evening with Under Secretary for Nuclear Security of the US Department of Energy and Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration to receive an update on the situation at the plant. The President will continue to be briefed regularly.""

US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm tweeted that she had spoken with her Ukrainian counterpart and said that the site's reactors are protected by ""robust containment structures"" and ""are being safely shut down.""

IAEA: No change reported in Zaporizhzhia radiation levels

Shortly after Russian shelling led to a fire at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said there had been no change in reported radiation levels.

Fighting has been reported at Zaporizhzhia, with Ukrainian authorities saying a training site outside the main plant is on fire. Firefighters have been unable to tend to the blaze as Russia keeps firing, an official from the Ukrainian Energy Ministry said.

The plant director said on Ukraine 24 television that radiation at the facility was secure.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia had resorted to ""nuclear terror"" by shelling Europe's largest nuclear power plant.

Fire breaks out at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant after shelling

Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, tweeted, ""Russian army is firing from all sides upon Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Fire has already broke out.""

Kuleba added, ""If it blows up, it will be 10 times larger than Chernobyl! Russians must IMMEDIATELY cease the fire, allow firefighters, establish a security zone!""

Ukraine's energy ministry told Russia's RIA news agency that firefighters are unable to tend to the blaze at the plant as Russian troops continue to fire on them.

Plant spokesman Andry Tuz said shells were striking the plant and one of the six reactors was on fire. He said the reactor that was hit was under renovation and therefore nonoperational.

Tuz said it was imperative to cease fighting so firefighters could contain the blaze.

Dmytro Humenyuk of the State Scientific and Technical Center for Nuclear and Radiation Safety told Hromadske that the power units have several layers of fuel protection. The plant generates 25% of Ukraine's electricity.

Humenyuk explained that under certain conditions, the power units can withstand up to 10 tons but are not designed to be hit by bombs or projectiles. If the reactor is seriously damaged and nuclear fuel exposed, the resulting catastrophe would be as bad as Chernobyl and if more than one reactor is hit, the result would be even more horrific.

Warning of a ""severe danger"" if the nuclear reactors were hit by shelling, the International Atomic Energy Agency said it was in contact with Ukrainian authorities.

Summary of events in Ukraine-Russia crisis on Thursday

Russia vowed to push forward with its invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, despite world condemnation and massive economic sanctions from the West.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said his country's ""operation"" in Ukraine will continue for now. He said any peace accord must include the ""demilitarization"" of Ukraine.

Russian President Vladimir Putin lauded the ""heroism"" of Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine. He claimed the war is ""going to plan"" and accused Ukrainian forces of using human shields without evidence.

As Russia’s war on Ukraine enters its second week, calls from Ukraine for more alliance support have been building. Among the requests: a NATO-enforced no-fly zone.

But imposing one in Ukraine, which might have to be enforced by shooting down Russian warplanes, is a step too far for NATO, Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said after an emergency meeting at allied headquarters in Brussels.

“We understand the desperation, but also believe if we did that, we’d end up in something that could end up in a full-fledged war in Europe, involving many more countries,” Stoltenberg said.

Ukraine Foreign Minister Kuleba Dmytro participated virtually in Friday’s talks, including the debate over a no-fly zone.

“We are not going to move into Ukraine, either on the ground or in the airspace,” Stoltenberg added.

However, allies are “seriously considering a significant increase” in troops and air defenses, Stoltenberg said. The final decision on a long-term force posture change could come at a heads of state summit in June.

Meanwhile, weaponry from NATO states continues to flow into Ukraine in the form of anti-tank Javelins, Stinger missiles, small arms and ammunition, government officials from across the alliance have said.

As talks got underway in Brussels, Stoltenberg and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken condemned Russia’s push into Ukraine, where attacks have intensified and civilians are among the targets.

Blinken also said allies are ready to defend NATO turf if challenged.

""Ours is a defensive alliance. We seek no conflict. But if conflict comes to us, we are ready for it and we will defend every inch of NATO territory,” Blinken said.

So far, the Russian military has faced stiff resistance from the Ukrainian military, a force that Russian President Vladimir Putin has underestimated, Stoltenberg said.

Still, the attacks by Russia are expected to get worse in the days ahead with cities under siege and civilian infrastructure, such as schools and hospitals, being among the targets, he said.

“The days to come are likely to be worse. With more death, more suffering, and more destruction, as the Russian armed forces bring in heavier weaponry and continue their attacks across the country,” Stoltenberg said.

For allies, the situation in Ukraine amounts to a security sea change in Europe, the effects of which are expected to last for years to come, allies said.

“Russia has shattered peace on the European continent. It has engaged in a war of a scale, of a type not seen in Europe since the Second World War… the threat of pervasive conflict is real,” Stoltenberg said.",https://www.stripes.com/theaters/europe/2022-03-04/nato-nixes-no-fly-zone-over-ukraine-to-avoid-wider-war-5223472.html

U.S. and allied leaders have opposed the idea despite condemning the decision by Russian President Vladimir Putin to launch the war last week, saying it risks putting Western and Russian forces in direct conflict and could spark a larger war.

“We understand the desperation, but we also believe that if we did that, we would end up with something that could lead to a fully-fledged war in Europe, involving much more countries,” Mr. Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels.

The NATO chief spoke after an emergency meeting of alliance foreign ministers including U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who plans to travel to NATO and allied countries along the border with Russia and Ukraine in the coming days.

NATO is walking a fine line in the conflict, offering material and political support to Ukraine but insisting its troops will not get involved in the war. One of Mr. Putin’s key demands, rejected by the U.S. and its partners, is that NATO pledge never to accept Kyiv as a member.

President Biden has repeatedly said U.S. forces will not join the fight in Ukraine. State Department spokesperson Ned Price told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in an interview this week that even setting up a no-fly zone over Ukraine would “take this conflict to a whole new level.”

Although Ukraine has put up unexpectedly tough resistance in the first week of fighting, Mr. Stoltenberg offered a pessimistic take on the clash, expressing alarm over Russia’s willingness to bomb cities and civilian targets, and over Thursday’s fighting near Ukraine’s giant Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant.

“The days to come are likely to be worse, with more death, more sufferings and more destruction,” he said.

BRUSSELS, March 4 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday said NATO would defend ""every inch"" of members' territory but emphasized the alliance was defensive, as foreign ministers resisted Ukrainian calls for a no-fly zone to battle the Russian invasion.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called for a no-fly zone since Moscow's invasion started on Feb. 24, with Russia shelling cities and bringing fighting to Europe's largest nuclear plant.

Ukraine is not a member of NATO, and members of the alliance, whose foreign ministers met in Brussels on Friday, are wary of being drawn into the war with nuclear-armed Russia.

""NATO will defend all its allies and territory against a Russian attack,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on arriving in Brussels, which hosts the alliance's headquarters.

""Ours is a defensive alliance. We seek no conflict. But if conflict comes to us, we are ready for it and we will defend every inch of NATO territory.""

NATO's head echoed Blinken's condemnation of Russian attacks on civilians in Ukraine, a former Soviet republic and Moscow satellite that wants to join the European Union as well as the Western military alliance.

Ukrainian authorities said on Friday Russian forces seized the largest nuclear power plant in Europe after a building at the Zaporizhzhia complex was set ablaze during intense fighting.

""This just demonstrates the recklessness of this war and the importance of ending it and the importance of Russia withdrawing all its troops,"" Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said.

While some countries indicated a willingness to discuss a no-fly zone, they made clear they did not consider it a viable option.

Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said that NATO's red line was to avoid triggering a wider conflict. France's presidential office described a no-fly zone as ""a very legitimate request and very difficult to satisfy.""

Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte said calls to get NATO involved into military conflict now were ""irresponsible.""

Putin launched his ""special military operation"" to get rid of what he said was Ukraine's fascist government and demilitarize the country. Zelenskiy says Moscow is trying to prevent a liberal democracy flourishing on Russia's border.

""We are now witnessing a fully-fledged war at our borders, a war unleashed by president Putin against Ukraine,"" the EU's top diplomat said ahead of the bloc's separate talks on Friday.

""We will consider everything. Everything remains on the table,"" Josep Borrell said of more sanctions on Russia.

NUCLEAR SCARE

On Thursday, Zelenskiy said that if allies wouldn't meet his request to protect Ukrainian air space, they should instead provide Kyiv with more war planes.

""We have 15 nuclear units so these units, two in the east are close to the front line of war. It's not just a Ukrainian question,"" Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko told Reuters on Thursday. ""We are fighting. We will fight to the end.""

Russia's land assault on the capital Kyiv has moved slowly but Russian forces have shelled residential blocks and key civilian infrastructure, including in Ukraine's second-largest city of Kharkiv in the northeast.

The Azov Sea port of Mariupol has been encircled and left without electricity or running water by heavy Russian bombing.

Spooked by the invasion, eastern members of the 30-nation NATO are ramping up defence spending and seeking more protection.

""Russian troops are in Ukraine and in Belarus, so we need to rethink everything,"" said Romania's Foreign Minister Bogdan, adding his country would increase its defence spending to 2.5% of GDP next year.

Poland announced plans to go up to 3%. Last week Germany also responded to the war with a commitment to increase military spending. In a departure from its long-declared policy, Berlin also authorised arms supplies to Ukraine.

“If we did that, we’ll end up with something that could end in a full-fledged war in Europe, involving many more countries and causing much more human suffering. So that’s the reason why we make this painful decision.""

The stance by the US-led bloc comes despite appeals from Ukraine’s leadership to help halt indiscriminate bombing against cities around the country.

Stoltenberg warned that “the days to come are likely to be worse, with more death, more suffering, and more destruction as Russian armed forces bring in heavier weaponry and continue their attacks across the country"".

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba addressed the alliance via videolink from Kyiv.

He tweeted afterwards: “My message: act now before it’s too late. Don’t let (Russian President Vladimir) Putin turn Ukraine into Syria. We are ready to fight. We will continue fighting. But we need partners to help us with concrete, resolute and swift actions, now.""

NATO members have rushed thousands of troops to eastern Europe to bolster the alliance’s flank closest to Russia and are sending weapons to help Ukraine defend itself.

“We will continue to do what it takes to protect and defend every inch of NATO territory. NATO is a defensive alliance. Our core task is to keep our 30 nations safe,"" Stoltenberg said.

“We are not part of this conflict and we have a responsibility to ensure it does not escalate and spread beyond Ukraine.""

Kyiv has said that if NATO is not willing to shut Ukrainian airspace then the allies should supply warplanes and air defence systems to help stop Russian air attacks.

European nations have so far said they will not deliver planes and most arms deliveries have focused on light weapons, and anti-tank and shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles.
