MOSCOW - A Russian Antonov An-26 transport plane carrying military equipment crashed in Russia's southern Voronezh region near Ukraine, killing all crew members on board, the defence ministry said Thursday.

""During a planned flight to transport military equipment, an An-26 aircraft of the Russian aerospace forces crashed,"" the defence ministry said in a statement carried by Russian news agencies. ""The crew died,"" the statement said, without providing any details.

The crash took place as Russian troops had crossed the Ukrainian border and were closing in on the capital Kyiv Thursday.

The defence ministry blamed equipment failure for the crash, which it said had not caused any destruction on the ground.

A defence ministry spokesman, speaking to AFP, confirmed the crash but declined to say how many crew members had been killed.

An-26 planes carry up to six crew members and up to 38 military personnel.

The early MiG aircraft were propeller-driven fighters produced in moderate numbers during World War II. The MiG-9, which first flew in 1946, did little more than apply jet propulsion to a piston-engine airframe; but the MiG-15, built with swept-back wings derived from German wartime research and powered by a copy of a Rolls-Royce engine, became one of the best of the early jet fighters. This single-seat, single-engine plane was first flown in 1947 and saw extensive combat in the Korean War. An improved version, the MiG-17, first flown in 1950, shared its maneuverability and was used as a defensive interceptor by North Vietnam in the Vietnam War during the 1960s and as a fighter-bomber by Egypt and Syria in the Arab-Israeli War of 1973. Twin engines made the MiG-19, first flown in 1953, the first supersonic fighter of European manufacture, but it was surpassed in 1955 by the MiG-21, a lightweight, single-engine interceptor capable of flying at twice the speed of sound. The basic version, which entered service in 1958, was a simple, low-cost day fighter that was highly maneuverable, easy to maintain, and able to operate from unimproved airfields. It became the principal high-altitude interceptor used by North Vietnam, and improved versions formed the backbone of Arab air forces through the 1970s.

The MiG-23, which entered active service in 1972, featured a variable-sweep wing intended to improve performance at various speeds and altitudes. It also introduced electronic sensor and warning systems of increasing sophistication that allowed successive MiG fighters to find and attack aircraft at greater ranges and against cluttered radar returns from the ground. A ground-attack version of the MiG-23, with armoured cockpit and more weapons stores, was known as the MiG-27. In response to U.S. experiments with high-altitude, supersonic bombers, the MiG-25 was designed about 1960. As introduced in 1970, this twin-engine interceptor, the fastest combat aircraft ever in active service, registered speeds of Mach 2.7 and 2.8, with an operational ceiling above 24,400 m (80,000 feet). These abilities also made it useful for reconnaissance. The MiG-31, a two-seat interceptor introduced in 1983, is based on the MiG-25 but is modified for less speed and better performance at lower altitudes. The MiG-29, first operational in 1985, is a single-seat, twin-engine air-to-air fighter that can also be used for ground attack.

Variants of most MiG jets except the MiG-23 and MiG-25 were also produced outside the Soviet Union in such countries as China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and India.",https://www.britannica.com/technology/MiG-Soviet-aircraft
4,20d8a366-d8d6-41ab-97df-416c8e9cf684,[],,"Before taking these numbers to heart, it is important to note that just as not all navy ships are created equal , some military aircraft are vastly more effective than others. For example, a modern fighter jet is quite different from an unarmed training helicopter, but both count as one aircraft. As such, the total number of aircraft a country possesses offers only a partial estimate of that country's airborne military prowess.

Just as flight has become a vital pillar of the transportation industry, so too has it modernized military operations. In the past 120 years, the world’s armed forces have been transformed as the notion of an ""air force"" of military aircraft has become not only possible, but indispensable. In fact, aircraft are so deeply integrated into modern military operations that the army, navy, and other branches of the military often have significant air fleets of their own. Compare the following three tables:

In an effort to create a more nuanced and accurate metric, the World Directory of Modern Military Aircraft (WDMMA) devised the TrueValue Rating, or TvR. This metric considers not only the number of aircraft in a given armed force, but also the type, capability, age, condition, and readiness of those aircraft. Filtered by TvR, the hierarchy changes significantly:

Top 15 Military Branches with the Most Powerful Air Fleets (by TrueValue Rating) - WDMMA 2021:

United States Air Force - 242.9 United States Navy - 142.4 Russian Air Force - 114.2 United States Army Aviation - 112.6 United States Marine Corps - 85.3 Indian Air Force - 69.4 People's Liberation Army Air Force (China) - 63.8 Japan Air Self-Defence Force - 58.1 Israeli Air Force - 58.0 French Air Force - 56.3 British Royal Air Force - 55.3 South Korean Air Force - 53.4 Italian Air Force - 51.9 Royal Australian Air Force - 51.7 People's Liberation Army Naval Air Force (China) - 49.3

Comparing the Military Air Power of the United States, Russia, and China

The United States air fleet

The United States of America maintains the strongest Air Force in the world by an impressive margin. As of late 2021, the United States Air Force (USAF) is composed of 5217 active aircraft, making it the largest, the most technologically advanced, and the most powerful air fleet in the world. What's more, the United States Navy, Army, and Marine Corps are close behind, bringing the United States' total available military aircraft to 13,247. This is larger than the combined air fleets of the next five countries on the list.

Ultimately, the United States' four main military branches occupy four of the top five spots, with the order changing slightly depending upon whether the metric in use is TvR rating or overall number of aircraft. Combat helicopters make up the largest portion of the US air fleet (particularly in the non-Air Force branches), accounting for 5,463, or about 41% of the total aircraft. The USAF also includes 2,660 trainers, 2,740 combat aircraft, 744 special mission aircraft, 627 tankers, 982 transports, and more.

Russia's air fleet

The Russian Air Force is a distant, but comfortable second to the USAF when it comes to military aircraft, with a total of 3,863 military aircraft (with another 310 allotted to the Navy). During the Cold War, Soviet airpower was comparable to that of the United States, but after the dissolving of the Soviet Union and the establishment of the Russian Federation, the Air Force budget was reduced considerably. However, since the turn of the 21st century, the Russian Air Force has been steadily improving and retains enough precursors to hold steady control of the #2 spot, at least for a little while longer.

China's air fleet

With 1,991 military aircraft in the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF), 857 in the Army, and 437 in the Navy (for a total of 3,285), the Chinese air fleet is the third largest in the world. Although China ranks behind Russia in total aircraft, they dwarf the Russian Air Force in terms of personnel. Moreover, the PLAAF has seen, perhaps, the most notable improvement among world Air Forces over the last 20 years. The PLAAF started out with an outdated fleet of second- or third-generation Soviet-built combat aircraft that were practically obsolete on the world stage. But in the new millennium, China has taken matters into its own hands, emulating USAF models and developing its own fourth-generation aircraft, which approach—and in some cases outperform—their USAF inspirations in both innovation and technological prowess. While China sits in a relatively distant third as of 2021, its current path of expansion indicates it may soon eclipse Russia for the second spot, perhaps even challenge the United States for the top rank.

The emergence of the Space Force

Modern military operations are not restricted to atmospheric affairs. In recent years, several countries have begun to develop some form of “space force” program, either as an expansion of their existing air force or as a standalone branch, that looks to extend their military influence to outer space and its boundless frontiers. While the majority of these programs are still in their infancy, spaceward expansion is imminent as countries look to bolster their military strength.",https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/largest-air-forces-in-the-world
5,20d8a366-d8d6-41ab-97df-416c8e9cf684,[],2022-03-11 00:00:00,"When Russia first invaded Ukraine in late February many experts predicted that the vast Russian military would swiftly outnumber and defeat the defending forces. However more than two weeks into the conflict Russia is still yet to have taken the capital city of Ukraine and the speed of the offensive seems to be slowing.

“The Russians have not achieved air superiority over the whole country,” a senior US defence official told reporters. “Ukrainian air defences remain intact and viable both in terms of aircraft and missile defence systems, and they’re engaged.”

However President Putin presides over the second-largest air service of any nation in the world, behind only the United States. Flying Mag reports that the Russian Air Force boasts 1,507 attack aircraft, the vast majority of which are stationed in Russia or around Eastern Europe.

Russia’s air force inventory also includes 1,837 support aircraft; 485 training aircraft; and 820 future aircraft. In total the Russian Air Force is comprised of 3,829 active aircraft.

Why have Russia failed to capture Ukraine?

As Putin was amassing the vast invasion forces along the Ukrainian border there was a general belief that Russia had to capability to easily overpower its neighbour. According to The Economist, Russia has spent billions of dollars on warplanes over the past decade, adding around 440 new fixed-wing aircraft between 2009 and 2020.

It was thought that Russia would quickly be able to assume aerial authority over Ukraine, allowing the Kremlin to pick off Ukrainian defences at will and paving the way for a successful land invasion.

Their failure in this regard is largely due to the scale and the sophistication of Ukraine’s aerial defences which have prevented Russia from gaining a foothold. Fearing that an invasion was on the cards Ukrainian officials dispersed the nation's air-defence system, making them harder to find and providing greater defensive coverage.

The invasion began with a battery of cruise and ballistic missiles trained on Ukrainian air bases but they failed to take out the aerial defences. American sources say that Ukrainian air and missile defences “remain effective and in use” and are helping to prevent the land forces from being overrun.

They have employed a two-part defence system which has reportedly taken out dozens of Russian aircraft already. Ukraine has used the Buk surface-to-air missiles to target Russian planes flying at altitude, the mobile system allowing operators to fire on enemies before quickly retreating to cover.

Their success saw Russian pilots forced to fly lower to evade the Buk’s radar system, but this only brought them into range of the smaller, shoulder-fired Stinger anti-aircraft missiles. Several videos shared by the Ukrainian defence ministry shows Russian attack aircraft being hit by this type of weapon and blown from the sky.

Official figures are disputed but it is clear that Ukrainian defences have eliminated a number of Russian aircraft already. Ukraine’s government claims that 39 planes and 40 helicopters have been wiped out already.

Footage from Ukraine has been studied by Stijn Mitzer, an Amsterdam-based military analyst, who has confirmed that 11 fixed-wing aircraft, 11 helicopters and two drones have been taken out by Ukraine.

This still leaves Putin with a huge air force and vastly superior military, but there is now a sense that Russia’s failure to wrestle control of the skies above Ukraine is costing them dearly.",https://en.as.com/en/2022/03/11/latest_news/1646953335_806897.html

Russia-Ukraine crisis: The crew onboard the Russian plane has been killed (Representational)

A Russian AN-26 military transport aircraft crashed in Russia’s southern Voronezh region, killing its crew on board. The accident could have been caused by a technical failure and has not inflicted any damage on the ground. How the world got then, what Russia wants, and further questions, answered. Russia has gathered as numerous as colours along the corridor of the Ukrainian border — and on Friday, the US advised “ we are in the window where an irruption could begin at any time.” US public security counsel Jake Sullivan didn’t offer any details to confirm that assessment, and Moscow on Saturday dismissed the US’s enterprises about an incoming irruption as “ fever.” But the Kremlin appears to be making all the medications for war, moving more military outfits, medical units, indeed blood, to the frontal lines. It’s an act of aggression that could spiral into the largest military conflict on European soil in decades. Against this background, political addresses between Russia and the United States and its abettors — including a direct call Saturday between US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin — haven’t yet yielded any results. The standoff is about the future of Ukraine. But Ukraine is also a larger stage for Russia to try to reassert its influence in Europe and the world, and for Putin to cement his heritage. These are no small effects for Putin, and he may decide that the only way to achieve them is to launch another irruption into Ukraine; an act, at its most aggressive, that could lead to knockouts of thousands of mercenary deaths, a European exile extremity, and a response from Western abettors that includes tough warrants affecting the global frugality.

The An-26 military transport aircraft of the Russian Air Force that crashed near Voronezh

The US and Russia have drawn firm red lines that help explain what’s at stake. Russia presented the US with a list of demands, some of which were nonstarters for the United States and its abettors in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Putin demanded that NATO stop its eastward expansion and deny class to Ukraine and that NATO roll back troop deployment in countries that had joined after 1997, which would turn back the timepiece decades on Europe’s security and geopolitical alignment. These duns are “ a Russian attempt not only to secure interest in Ukraine but basically relitigate the security armature in Europe,” said Michael Kofman, exploration director in the Russia studies program at CNA, an exploration and analysis association in Arlington, Virginia. As anticipated, the US and NATO rejected those demands. Both the US and Russia know Ukraine isn’t going to come to a NATO member anytime soon. Some preeminent American foreign policy thinkers argued at the end of the Cold War that NATO Norway should have moved near Russia’s borders in the first place. But NATO’s open-door policy says autonomous countries can choose their own security alliances.

Russian media reports claim a crash of a Russian AN-26 military transport in the Voronezh region due to a technical failure.

Giving in to Putin’s demands would hand the Kremlin prescription power over NATO’s decision- timber, and through it, the mainland’s security. When the Soviet Union broke up in the early ’90s, Ukraine, a former Soviet democracy, had the third-largest infinitesimal magazine in the world. The United States and Russia worked with Ukraine to mechanize the country, and in a series of political agreements, Kyiv gave its hundreds of nuclear warheads back to Russia in exchange for security assurances that defended it from an implicit Russian attack. Those assurances were put to the test in 2014 when Russia raided Ukraine. Russia adjoined the Crimean Peninsula and backed a rebellion led by pro-Russian secessionists in the eastern Donbas region. The conflict in eastern Ukraine has killed more than people to date.",https://fanaticbuff.com/russian-an-26-military-transport-aircraft-crashes-in-russias-voronezh-region-during-military-equipment-transportation-the-entire-crew-was-killed/
