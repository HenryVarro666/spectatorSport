0,35a08baf-a4e4-49cf-bc84-5efea14e3cd8,[],2022-03-16 00:00:00,"Russian president says West aims to damage the Russian economy but insists the it could withstand the sanctions.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has said his country would achieve its goals in Ukraine and would not submit to what he called a Western attempt to achieve global dominance and dismember Russia.

Putin said Russia was ready to discuss neutral status for Ukraine, three weeks into a war that has killed thousands of people and forced millions of Ukrainians to flee their homes.

In a speech to government ministers broadcast on Wednesday, Putin went further than before in acknowledging the pain that Western sanctions were inflicting on the economy, but insisted that Russia could withstand the blow.

There was no sign of any softening in his bitter invective against the West and Ukraine.

“In the foreseeable future, it was possible that the pro-Nazi regime in Kyiv could have got its hands on weapons of mass destruction, and its target, of course, would have been Russia,” Putin said.

Putin has consistently described the democratically elected leaders of Ukraine as neo-Nazis bent on committing genocide against Russian-speakers in the east of the country – a line that the West denounces as baseless war propaganda.

He said Western countries wanted to turn Russia into a “weak dependent country; violate its territorial integrity; to dismember Russia in a way that suits them”.

If the West thought that Russia would break or back down, “they don’t know our history or our people,” Putin said on the 21st day of the war.

“Behind the hypocritical talk and today’s actions of the so-called collective West are hostile geopolitical goals. They just don’t want a strong and sovereign Russia.”

Putin said inflation and unemployment would rise in Russia, and structural changes to the economy would be needed. But he promised support to families with children.

He said the West had in effect declared Russia in default as part of its sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine, but that the conflict had been only a pretext for the West to impose those sanctions.

“The West doesn’t even bother to hide that their aim is to damage the entire Russian economy, every Russian,” Putin said.

Ukraine neutrality

The Russian leader said his country was ready to discuss Ukraine’s neutral status in talks.

“The question of principle for our country and its future – the neutral status of Ukraine, its demilitarisation, and its denazification – we were ready and we are ready to discuss as part of negotiations.”

Ukraine has said it is willing to negotiate to end the war but will not surrender or accept Russian ultimatums.

“Ukraine is now in a direct state of war with Russia. Consequently, the model can only be ‘Ukrainian’ and only on legally verified security guarantees,” Kyiv’s negotiator Mikhailo Podolyak said on Wednesday.

Putin said the military operation was “going to plan” and that the Russian army was not targeting civilians.

The fighting has sent more than three million people fleeing the country, by the United Nations’ estimate.

Kyiv seeks ceasefire, withdrawal, security guarantees

KYIV/LVIV, Ukraine, March 16 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday called Russian leader Vladimir Putin a war criminal in comments the Kremlin said were ""unforgivable"" as it insisted the war in Ukraine was ""going to plan"" amid talk of compromise at peace talks.

Kremlin forces kept up their bombardments of besieged cities, including intensified shelling of the capital Kyiv, and civilians waiting in line for bread and sheltering in a theatre were killed, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials

Moscow has yet to capture any of Ukraine's biggest cities following its invasion that began on Feb. 24, the largest assault on a European state since World War Two, raising fears of wider conflict in the West.

Putin on Wednesday said he would discuss neutral status for Ukraine and that what he calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarize the country was ""going to plan"". Kyiv and allies say his actions are an unprovoked incursion, and more than 3 million Ukrainians have fled and hundreds have died.

The United States announced an additional $800 million in security assistance to Ukraine to fight Russia, with the new package including drones, anti-armour and anti-aircraft systems.

""More will be coming as we source additional stocks of equipment that ... we are ready to transfer,"" Biden said, later condemning Putin.

""He is a war criminal,"" he told reporters.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the comment was ""unacceptable and unforgivable rhetoric"", according to Tass news agency.

Ukraine still hopes for a diplomatic solution. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said negotiations were becoming ""more realistic"" and Russia said proposals under discussion were ""close to an agreement.""

The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv said Russian forces had shot dead 10 people waiting in line for bread in Chernihiv, northeast of Kyiv. Russia denied the attack and said the incident was a hoax.

Emergency services said rescue workers had found the bodies of five people during searches of shell-hit buildings.

In the besieged southern port of Mariupol, the city council said Russian forces bombed a theatre where civilians were sheltering. The number of casualties was not known.

Russia denied it had carried out an air strike against the theatre. Reuters could not independently verify the information.

Maxar Technologies, a private U.S. company, distributed satellite imagery that it said was collected on March 14 and showed the word ""children"" in large Russian script painted on the ground outside the red-roofed Mariupol Drama Theatre.

The governor of Zaporizhzhia region said Russian forces had fired artillery at a convoy of evacuees from Mariupol, wounding five people on Wednesday.

Three people were killed and five wounded after shelling caused a fire at a market in eastern Kharkiv, Ukraine's second city, emergency services said.

Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said 400 staff and patients were being held hostage at a Mariupol hospital that Russian forces captured on Tuesday.

Moscow denies targeting civilians.

Kyiv's Mayor Vitali Klitschko said Russian shelling caused a fire and damaged private homes and a gas line in the evening after early morning barrages.

Russian troops have halted at the gates of the capital after taking heavy losses.

Ukraine handed over nine captured soldiers to secure the freedom of the mayor of the city of Melitopol, who was detained last week, the Interfax Ukraine news agency quoted a senior official as saying on Wednesday.

And as an information battle goes on alongside fighting, Facebook on Wednesday removed official Russian posts that falsely claimed reports of Russia bombing a children's hospital in Ukraine were a hoax.

Russia has shifted its stance over the bombing that caused outrage around the world with a mix of statements that veered between aggressive denials and a call to establish clear facts.

'DARKEST TIME'

In a speech to the U.S. Congress by video link, Zelenskiy repeated a request for a no-fly zone over Ukraine, something the West won't introduce.

""In the darkest time for our country, for the whole of Europe, I call on you to do more,"" he said.

NATO defence ministers meeting in Brussels pledged more arms supplies to help Ukraine.

The U.N. Security Council is due to vote on Friday on a Russian-drafted call for aid access and civilian protection, but diplomats say the measure is set to fail because it does not push for an end to the fighting or withdrawal of troops.

Delegations from the two sides were meeting via video conference, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday as efforts continued for a diplomatic solution.

The Kremlin said negotiators were discussing a status for Ukraine similar to that of Austria or Sweden, both members of the European Union that are outside the NATO military alliance.

Ukraine's chief negotiator said Kyiv was still demanding a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian troops, with guarantees.

Zelenskiy has said Ukraine could accept international security guarantees that stopped short of its longstanding aim to join NATO. That prospect has been one of Russia's primary concerns.

""Neutral status is now being seriously discussed along, of course, with security guarantees,"" Lavrov said. ""There are absolutely specific formulations which in my view are close to agreement.""

Vladimir Medinsky, Russia's chief negotiator, told state TV: ""Ukraine is offering an Austrian or Swedish version of a neutral demilitarised state, but at the same time a state with its own army and navy.""

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the idea ""could really be seen as a compromise"".

Austria and Sweden, the biggest of six EU members outside NATO, both have small militaries that cooperate with the alliance.

DAMAGE TO RUSSIA'S ECONOMY

Ukrainian forces have withstood an assault by a much larger army but the humanitarian toll is rising.

Ukraine said about 20,000 people had escaped besieged Mariupol in cars, but hundreds of thousands remain trapped.

The economic fallout is also being felt around the world.

The Biden administration has authorized additional exports of liquefied natural gas from Texas-based Cheniere Energy in a move that could help Europe deal with a worsening crunch.

Meanwhile, Russia was due to pay $117 million in interest on dollar-denominated sovereign bonds but may pay in roubles instead, amounting to its first default on foreign debt since the Bolshevik revolution.

Moscow said it had the money, and Washington would be to blame if it cannot pay.

In his most explicit acknowledgment of the pain inflicted by Western sanctions, Putin said inflation and unemployment would rise, and structural changes to the economy would be needed.

The Kremlin doubled down Thursday on recent statements by President Vladimir Putin that Russian society would benefit from what he called a ""cleansing"" of ""scum and traitors"" who align with the West in its criticism of the war in Ukraine.

The reference evoked terrifying memories of the mass arrests of the Stalin era — when repressions were justified for ""cleansing"" Soviet society of traitors — and it followed new laws criminalizing criticism of what the Kremlin calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.

Russia has seen an exodus of political activists, journalists, celebrities and entrepreneurs critical of the war or fearing its consequences.

In comments on Wednesday, Putin lashed out at Russians who — the Kremlin leader argued — were ""mentally"" aligned with the West amid the Ukraine crisis. Putin said their true aim is to work with ""the collective West"" to destroy Russia from within.

""The Russian people will always be able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors and simply spit them out like a gnat that accidentally flew into their mouths,"" Putin said.

""I am convinced that such a natural and necessary cleansing of society will only strengthen our country, our solidarity, cohesion and readiness to respond to any challenges,"" he said in remarks that more broadly addressed Russia's efforts to counteract Western sanctions.

On Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov tried to clarify Putin's comments, saying they were directed against Russians who had, in one way or another, left the country in a moment of need.

""In such difficult times ... many people show their true colors. Very many people are showing themselves, as we say in Russian, to be traitors,"" Peskov said in a call with journalists.

""They vanish from our lives themselves,"" he added, noting, ""Some people are leaving their posts. Some are leaving their active work life. Some leave the country and move to other countries. That is how this cleansing happens.""

Thousands have left the country as authorities crack down on dissent

In the three weeks since Putin's decision to send Russian troops into Ukraine, thousands of Russians have fled their country — heading to Turkey, Georgia, Armenia and elsewhere — both in protest over the military campaign and in fear of a political crackdown.

A new Russian law this month began criminalizing the spread of ""fake news"" or public statements seen as denigrating Russia's armed forces.

Since the start of the invasion on Feb. 24, police have detained about 15,000 Russians, mostly at anti-war protests, according to Russian independent human rights group OVD-Info. Some have also been fired from jobs or been kicked out of universities for expressing criticism of the mission.

Russian authorities have already charged dozens with administrative violations under the new law. Alleged offenders include a priest in the western Russian region of Kostroma who preached against hatred in a sermon and a young woman in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk who carved the words ""no to war"" in snow by a statue of Soviet state founder Vladimir Lenin.

This week, the first criminal charges have followed, including against Veronika Belotserkovskaya, a Russian cookbook author, socialite and blogger living in Europe who has been criticizing the war to her online followers.

A Committee in Defense of National Interests has also begun publishing online a list of Russians who left the country — denouncing them as ""cowards and deserters.""

Artyom, a liberal political activist reached by NPR in Tbilisi, Georgia, says he fled Russia after neighbors alerted him that masked police were waiting outside his apartment. He requested that NPR not use his full name out of fear for the safety of relatives still in Russia.

""I had no chance to tell anyone I was leaving, because it was too dangerous,"" he says. ""I've got a dog and a cat still at home, and that's the hardest part. Because I can tell my friends and family what happened, but the dog will not understand.""

Anna, a Russian writer who also requested that NPR use only her first name, says she fled with her family to Turkey after she realized her open criticism of the Kremlin and her attendance at an anti-war protest left her vulnerable to arrest.

""I remember my grandmother telling me about the fear of living under Stalin,"" she says. ""I remember her saying, 'You can't imagine the fear.' Well, now I've felt it, and I don't want my kid to ever experience anything like that.""

Those who've left Russia include well-known stars

The Kremlin has also had to deal with dissension among Russia's cultural and financial elite.

On Wednesday, Russian prima ballerina Olga Smirnova announced she would leave the world-renowned Bolshoi Ballet to join the Dutch National Ballet. In a post on the Telegram messaging app, Smirnova said Russians ""cannot remain indifferent to this global catastrophe.""

Rapper Oxxxymiron, one of Russia's biggest stars, who's known for his political statements, canceled a series of sold-out shows in Russia and on Tuesday played an anti-war concert in Istanbul. He has since announced additional ""Russians Against War"" performances in Europe and pledged to send the proceeds to Ukrainian refugees.

On Russia's main state-run Channel One, a one-woman protest disrupted a live evening newscast this week. Marina Ovsyannikova, the editor who burst onto the screen with an anti-war, anti-propaganda poster, awaits an investigation.

Several high-profile correspondents have reportedly since resigned from state-backed channels. One of Channel One's stars — popular late-night talk show host Ivan Urgant — found his program on unexpected hiatus after he publicly opposed the war.

Two of the wealthiest Russians have spoken out against the invasion of Ukraine: billionaires Oleg Deripaska and Mikhail Fridman, both of whom keep residences in London.

Indeed, disloyalty — rather than wealth — was very much on Putin's mind in his ""cleansing"" speech on Wednesday.

""I do not in the least condemn those who have villas in Miami or the French Riviera, who cannot make do without foie gras, oysters or gender freedom, as they call it,"" said the Russian leader.

""The problem, again, is that many of these people are, essentially, over there in their minds and not here with our people and with Russia.""",https://www.npr.org/2022/03/17/1087287150/putins-warning-to-anti-war-russians-evokes-stalinist-purges
4,35a08baf-a4e4-49cf-bc84-5efea14e3cd8,['Analysis Angela Dewan'],2022-03-17 00:00:00,"(CNN) Western leaders and security agencies are spending huge amounts of resources on getting into Russian President Vladimir Putin's head. It's a futile exercise -- at times when the West has thought Russia's war in Ukraine might be losing steam, Putin has doubled down, sending his forces to bomb maternity hospitals and shelters harboring children.

Now, an apparent pause in the advancement of Russian troops has the West guessing : Has Russia's war effort stalled? Or is it a tactical regrouping?

Either way, an incendiary Stalinesque speech on Wednesday night in which Putin called Russians opposing the war ""traitors"" marked a change in tone and a sign that not all is going to plan, experts said. Perhaps more worrying, many observers saw it as a sign that the head of the Russian state, facing setback in Ukraine, would take a vengeful turn at home and crack down more forcefully than ever on any sign of dissent.

While some Russians support the war, many others are protesting against it in the streets, fully aware they will be rounded up by heavily armed police even for the most peaceful of demonstrations. The Russian state has made mass protests illegal, and now, insulting the military is against the law. Still, people show up in groups, while others demonstrate entirely alone. Even lone protesters have been detained, social media videos have shown.

Putin, who has enjoyed consistently high ratings in Russia, is now turning to a strategy of intimidation to keep Russians on side, experts said. His speech Wednesday hinted darkly that those Russians who do not side with him were, in essence, traitors -- chilling words in a country where mass political repressions and the Gulag system are still within living memory.

""The West will try to rely on the so-called fifth column, on national traitors, on those who earn money here with us but live there. And I mean 'live there' not even in the geographical sense of the word, but according to their thoughts, their slavish consciousness,"" Putin said. The ""fifth column"" usually refers to sympathizers of the enemy during a war.

""Such people who by their very nature, are mentally located there, and not here, are not with our people, not with Russia,"" Putin said, mocking them as the type that ""cannot live without oysters and gender freedom.""

""But any people, and even more so the Russian people, will always be able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors, and simply spit them out like a gnat that accidentally flew into their mouths, spit them out on the pavement,"" he said.

For Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of the political analysis firm R. Politik, Putin's speech proved the leader's plan has derailed.

""It seems to me that everything is starting to crumble with Putin. This speech of his is despair, strong emotion, impotence,"" she wrote on her official Telegram account.

Pointing to the situation in Russia, Stanovaya argues that Putin is losing the battle of popularity, too.

""This is the beginning of the end. Yes, they will twist everyone's elbows, lock them up, imprison them, but it is already all without a future ... Everything will crack and slip.""

Elisabeth Braw, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said Putin's speech reflected how isolated the Russian leader had become.

""What we saw as the war began, and what we have seen since -- including last night's speech -- is really the result of a man whose entire world takes place inside his head,"" Braw told CNN, explaining how Putin had isolated intensely during the pandemic and was now more cut off as Western sanctions batter the Russian economy.

She said that he was likely surprised and angered by how far the West has gone with sanctions, and was now worried of the backlash that would likely soon come from the Russian people.

""There is a sort of humiliation of a country that is now seeing McDonald's close, where Russians are flocking to IKEA to get every last item that's available before it leaves the country -- that is humiliating, and of course, also rather frightening when you think of the potential reaction among the Russian public once these consumer goods are no longer available,"" she said.

""Russian forces have made minimal progress on land, sea or air in recent days and they continue to suffer heavy losses,"" the ministry tweeted Thursday, adding that Ukrainian resistance remained ""staunch and well-coordinated.""

That chimes with the assessment from a senior US defense official, who told reporters on Monday that Russian forces in and around several key cities had made no appreciable progress over the prior weekend.

It may be wishful thinking to read so much into this pause. Russia's military is far mightier than Ukraine's by every measure. Any ""stall"" is more likely to be tactical than a sign of Russia backing down.

Nonetheless, Russia's invasion hasn't brought easy pickings for Putin. In 2014, Russia was able to annex Crimea in around three weeks -- the same amount of time this war has raged so far. Ukraine's resistance, propped up by weapons sent from the West, has been greater than Putin had calculated, experts said.

That's clear by the way Russian forces are now bombing civilian targets indiscriminately. They are also showing signs of being stretched to their limits.

A public intelligence assessment report released Tuesday by the UK Defense Ministry said that Russia was calling up reinforcements from across the entire country. This includes the eastern section of the Russian Federation, troops in the Pacific Fleet and Armenia, as well as fighters from ""private military companies, Syrians, and other mercenaries.""

Braw said that the stall in Russian forces' movement was likely the result of Russia working out next steps.

""Russia clearly counted on a swift and decisive success, which didn't happen. They face more united, better trained Ukrainian fighters than Russia appreciated,"" she said. ""So they went to Plan B, which was brutal warfare, but Ukraine is standing firm. They are winning back towns, they recently liberated a local mayor who was taken captive. So if that's not working, what's Plan C?""

At the very least, Ukraine's resistance has put the country in a better place for negotiations with Putin than it would have been at the start of the war, Braw said.

What Putin won't want is to lose many more soldiers, she added.

""If Russia returns from the Ukrainian war with a completely decimated military, it's clearly pursued the wrong strategy.""",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/17/europe/putin-speech-russia-ukraine-conflict-intl-cmd/index.html
5,35a08baf-a4e4-49cf-bc84-5efea14e3cd8,"['Paul D. Shinkman', 'March', 'At P.M.']",2022-03-16 00:00:00,"President Vladimir Putin put forward a comprehensive, if disjointed, defense of Russia’s bloody assault on Ukraine three weeks after it began in an apparent recognition of growing international outrage at the brutality of the campaign.



In lengthy remarks Wednesday before a meeting about socioeconomic support for Russian citizens, Putin lobbed familiar claims at growing international condemnation for the military campaign he launched on a scale unseen on the continent since World War II, while also appearing to shift some of the responsibility for it. He offered, for example, that the character of the military assault – to include indiscriminate shelling of civilian centers and facilities such as maternity wards – originated within the Russian military and the general staff.

Putin asserted Russia has no interest in occupying the former Soviet state and the seat of Russians’ ethnic history. He claimed that Ukraine could pose a nuclear threat to Russia and that it has been ruled by a neo-Nazi regime. He repeated debunked theories that Pentagon-funded biolabs in Ukraine pose a threat to Russian citizens. And he cited discredited accusations that Kyiv has backed a genocidal campaign against ethnic Russians in the eastern region known as Donbas where Russia has supported an ongoing separatist conflict for eight years.

“We simply weren’t left with any options to peacefully solve the problems arising through no fault of ours,” Putin said, according to a translation of his remarks. And employing the term he has insisted his countrymen use in place of “war,” he added, “We were simply forced to launch a special military operation.”

He deferred to the Russian military and its leadership for the tactics they have employed in Ukraine but said that it “has fully justified itself.” Putin appealed to ordinary Westerners in claiming that their countries have ignored ongoing genocide against ethnic Russians in the Donbas region, without provide evidence of such attrocities.

And, seemingly acknowledging new political fronts he faces at home, he put forward troubling language about the need for “cleansing of the nation” against those who do not support the Kremlin’s policies.

Putin’s lengthy remarks took place while his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskeyy, simultaneously addressed the U.S. Congress, offering an emotional plea for new forms of support to break the burgeoning stalemate. He showed the assembled lawmakers a video juxtapoxing pre-war scenes of life in Ukraine against the horrors of the prior three weeks to include mass displacement, urban destruction and brutal deaths – particularly among women and children.

Several leading lawmakers expressed disgust at the scenes Zelenskeyy outlined and offered new support for his requests, specifically that the U.S. dramatically increase the defensive weaponry Ukraine needs to defend against Russian airstrikes and artillery barrages.

“It is clear that more must be done to assist Ukraine and hold Putin to account,” Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, New Hampshire Democrat, said in a statement following Zelenskeyy’s virtual address. “The images we watched today underscore the horrific violence – the war crimes – being committed by Putin. He will pay for what he has done.”

And many in Washington have grown more earnest in their overt support for U.S. strategies that could weaken Putin’s autocratic grip on Russia and help speed up his political demise.

“It’s time for him to go. He’s a war criminal,” Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, an erstwhile standard bearer for the Republican Party’s Reagan-era foreign policies, told reporters shortly after Zelenskeyy’s address. “I am asking the Russian people to rise up and end his rein of terror.”



Though many on both sides of the political divide, including Graham, have supported President Joe Biden’s hesitancy to enforce a NATO-backed no-fly zone over Ukraine – fearing the potential for an escalation of war between the West and Russia – many believe the U.S. should do much more to increase the potency of Ukraine’s military defenses against the Russian assault and ramp up pressure on Putin.

Biden acknowledged those concerns in a public address on Wednesday before signing a budget bill that also affords billions of dollars worth of emergency aid to Ukraine.

“That’s our goal: Make Putin pay the price, weaken his position, while strengthening the hand of Ukrainians on the battlefield and at the negotiating table,” Biden said.

He announced the U.S. would send more anti-aircraft and anti-armor weapons as well as drones to Ukraine to assist in defense against Russia – while simultaneously threatening Putin with protracting a military conflict that has already prompted unusual acts of dissent among Russians.

And Ukraine’s existing defenses have already surprised the Kremlin as much as the West, undercutting prior assessments that Russia could win a war in Ukraine within days. Instead, Moscow has not accomplished any of its objectives going into its third week of warfare, the Pentagon assesses, and many of its troops remain bogged down without clear plans for resupply or reinforcement.

In an act of apparent desperation, Putin has redeployed Russian forces previously stationed as far away as the Pacific and offered an open appeal for assistance from mercenaries and other foreign fighters – particularly from Syria, where Russia’s military support successfully propped up the regime of Bashar Assad following more than a decade of civil conflict and insurgent warfare.

Yet Russia retains 90 percent of its fighting power in Ukraine, according to a U.S. Defense Department assessment presented to reporters on Wednesday, leaving Putin on the precipice of a quagmire he could still avoid.

“Putin has no incentive to retreat and will use Russia’s current advantage in mass and firepower to gain territory even if it means losing a lot of its own people,” Anna Borshchevskaya, a senior fellow in The Washington Institute for Near East Policy, wrote in an analysis note on Tuesday.

Borshchevskaya argues the U.S. needs to move beyond avoiding the worst-case scenarios in Ukraine – an open conflict between NATO and Russia – and consider other strategies that would force Russia to believe it will fall into the kind of entrenchment in Ukraine it was able to largely avoid in its similarly brazen campaign to prop up Assad in Syria.



“Ukraine is not another Syria for Vladimir Putin. But rather than celebrating that Putin has already lost, the West needs to focus on how it can truly win—how to give Putin a loss he cannot come back from,” she writes.

Others have advocated for U.S. contributions to airlift operations to Ukraine that could help stem the growing humanitarian crisis there while simultaneously exert pressure on Putin.

“Vladimir Putin would either consent and facilitate distribution of supplies or provoke more denunciations of Russia for its inhumanity,” the Hudson Institute’s Douglas Feith and John Hannah wrote in an analysis note. “Even if criticism doesn’t move him, his top lieutenants may worry about their image and their vulnerability to war-crimes trials. This proposal may aggravate whatever divisions exist within Mr. Putin’s team and trigger further antiwar sentiment among ordinary Russians.”

Though it remains unclear how eager Putin has become to find some sort of exit from the protracted conflict, his government has stepped up diplomatic and political efforts to negotiate some sort of face-saving settlement with Ukraine. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told RBC news on Wednesday that both sides are close to some sort of neutrality deal for Ukraine that he said could address Russia’s concerns about its aspirations to align more closely with Western military powers.",https://www.usnews.com/news/world-report/articles/2022-03-16/a-war-of-one-putin-defends-brutal-campaign-in-ukraine-as-global-condemnation-grows
6,35a08baf-a4e4-49cf-bc84-5efea14e3cd8,['Alexander Smith Is A Senior Reporter For Nbc News Digital Based In London.'],2022-03-17 17:00:44.118000+00:00,"LONDON — Anyone looking for signs that embattled and isolated Russia might soften its position would not have found much hope in the increasingly belligerent words of President Vladimir Putin.

With his invasion of Ukraine floundering and his economy teetering, Putin doubled down Wednesday, turning his baleful glare on Russians who are against the invasion or who sympathize with the West.

""The Russian people will always be able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors and will simply spit them out like an insect in their mouth onto the pavement,"" he said, shoulders hunched and staring down the barrel of the camera.

It was the latest speech to surprise and alarm many who study Putin. He has adopted what they say is an emotional, ranting tone since Russia invaded Ukraine three weeks ago, a departure from the calculating persona of a former KGB officer.

""He's clearly angry, emotional and feels the need to speak in this very aggressive tone,"" said John Lough, an associate fellow at London’s Chatham House think tank.

Lough said the speech was clearly aimed at Russia's elites, some of whom he believes are privately dismayed about the failure of the war and the economic backlash it has inflicted at home.

According to Lough, Putin was saying to the elites: ""Don't think about having second thoughts. We're all in this together, and if I go down, you go down.""",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/scum-traitors-pressure-ukraine-putin-turns-ire-russians-rcna20410

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

How you can help: Here are ways those in the U.S. can help support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.
