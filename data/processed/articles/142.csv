0,9a0652b6-25c3-43e4-9704-da179adbba66,['Belarusian Hajun Project'],2022-04-07,"Belarusian Hajun Project published a situation report on military activity on the territory of Belarus as of 22:00 April 7.

Russian Armed Forces columns continue to move through the territory of Belarus (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The convoys mostly consist of Ural, KamAZ, and KrAZ trucks. There are also fuel trucks, trailers, armored personnel carriers, armored vehicles, and off-road vehicles of various modifications.

19:30. A column of Russian military vehicles with “V” marks was seen at the exit from Dobrush on the M10 highway, moving towards Russia. The vehicles include UAZ, GAZel, KamAZ and Ural trucks, Ural-Federal, armored personnel carriers, fuel trucks. pic.twitter.com/ruTVUG85j4 — Belarusian Hajun project (@MotolkoHelp) April 7, 2022

We should also mention the truck that was moving along the Kalinkavichy-Gomel route. It was transporting a large quantity of 30-mm ammunition for the 2A42 (2A72) automatic rifle used on the BMP-2 and BTR-82A. The ammunition was transported in the body without observing the minimum safety rules.

A truck full of 30-mm shells was seen on the M10 highway, moving from Kalinkavichy towards Gomel.

It can be seen that 30 mm ammunition is transported without observing any safety rules at all.

We can distinguish the following routes of columns’ movement:

Minsk-Babruisk;

Gomel-Rechitsa;

Smaliavichy-Barysau;

Naroulya-Mazyr;

Mazyr-Kalinkavichy;

Kalinkavichy-Gomel;

Kalinkavichy-Brest;

Gomel-Dobrush-Russian border;

Thus, the localization of movements of military equipment remains in the southeastern areas of Gomel region.

Movements of columns with fighting vehicles of the Armed Forces of Russia were also recorded. For example, a column of 30 vehicles (including 122 mm Grad MLRS) was moving along the Brahin-Khoiniki route. Six trailers carrying 152 mm 2S3 Akatsiya self-propelled guns were moving towards Mazyr. A column of engineer vehicles (MDK-3, BAT-2 and UR-77) was seen on Partyzanski prospekt in Minsk. Armored vehicles were also transported on trailers along the Kamaryn-Brahin route.

Today, a column of 4 trailers based on KamAZ and Ural trucks with “V” marks was transporting Russian equipment, moving from Kamaryn towards Brahin along the R-35 highway. pic.twitter.com/mWpK7rpMIA — Belarusian Hajun project (@MotolkoHelp) April 7, 2022

Flight activity was recorded at military airfields in Belarus. For example, 14 departures and six landings were recorded in Baranavichy, including two IL-76 transport aircraft. Fighter flights from the airfield in Baranavichy performed by the Belarusian Air Force were of training nature.

Russian Air Force Tu-154 and Tu-134 arrived and departed from Machulischy, 15 helicopters flew to the Seshcha airfield (Bryansk region, Russia), helicopters also flew to the Ostrov airfield (Pskov region, Russia). There were also training flights of the Belarusian Air Force during the day.

There was an intensive movement of equipment of the Russian Armed Forces by rail. For example, about 20 units of Russian equipment were seen at the Kalodzishchy railway station, the equipment was loaded onto train platforms. Later, the train headed in the direction of Barysau.

A large number of empty train platforms and a small number of vehicles was seen at the Gomel-Nechetny and Gomel-North railway stations. Later, a train with military equipment departed from the Gomel-Nechetny station. Railway transportation activity in Gomel remains.

A train with military equipment (including 4 Iskander missile systems and transport loading vehicles) were moving from the Orsha-East railway station to Orsha-Central station. Later, the train headed towards Smolensk (Russia). There was a cluster of military equipment near Rechitsa railway station. A train with Ural trucks was unloaded at Yelsk station, and tracked vehicles were loaded onto a new train. Later, at least 20 tanks arrived at the station for further loading.

Unloading of heavy equipment of the Russian Armed Forces was recorded at the railway station in Yukhnovichy (Ivanava district). Military equipment was seen at the Kozenki railway station (Mazyr district). The movement of equipment was also spotted in the direction of Ziabrauka railway station (Gomel district).

No strikes on the territory of Ukraine by tactical missile systems from the territory of Belarus were recorded.

There were reports that the Russian Armed Forces field hospital, previously equipped in Naroulya, was disbanded. Also, Russian military left the airfield in Lida.

Information about the death of an officer, which we reported on April 5, was confirmed. It became known that the car of the Belarusian border guards hit a mine in the Naroulya district. Lieutenant colonel of the Belarusian KGB Reutski died as a result of the explosion.

At around 11:00 on April 7, residents of the villages of Tsareblichy, Azdamichy and Alhomel (Stolin district, Brest region) heard a strong rumble and then an explosion, saw smoke. Later, it became known that it was the Kh-35UE anti-ship missile, presumably fired from the territory of Belarus, which fell or was shot down. So far, there are two versions of what happened: 1) the missile fell off the fighter; 2) there were problems during the launch and the missile fell in the field.

Wreckage of cruise missile was found near David-Haradok, local residents say they heard an explosion.
