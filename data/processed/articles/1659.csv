Russian forces attacked a state administration building in Mykolaiv, Ukraine, Tuesday morning, just as employees were arriving, according to an official.

There were no reported casualties in the attack.

Vitaliy Kim, the head of regional administration, shared a photo of the administration building as the sun was still rising. The photo shows a massive hole in the building, reportedly from aircraft that entered the Nikolaev area from Crimea.

Russia has repeatedly used the Crimean Peninsula, which is internationally recognized as a part of Ukraine, to launch military operations.

Most of the staff who were working in the administration building evacuated safely, though eight people remain trapped in the rubble, the Kyiv Independent reported.

""Three military personnel [are] believed to be under the rubble,"" the outlet said.

MYKOLAIV, Ukraine, March 29 (Reuters) - A Russian rocket hit the regional administration building in the southern Ukrainian port city of Mykolaiv on Tuesday, killing at least 12 people and wounding 33, the authorities said.

The wounded were pulled from the rubble by rescue workers, who continue to work at the scene, the emergencies service said in an online post.

Footage from the state rescue service showed a gaping hole in a side of the building, with firefighters extinguishing a fire where the rocket hit and the wounded being put onto ambulance stretchers.

There was a blood patch visible in the debris, and shattered glass and upturned furniture strewn on the floor in the offices inside the building.

""This is just a nightmare. A girl died on my floor. What can I say? Are you kidding? I hugged her, two minutes passed, and she passed,"" said a woman who was helped out of the building by rescuers.

""They destroyed half of the building, hit my office,"" regional governor Vitaliy Kim said.

Russian forces have attacked Ukraine's southern ports including Kherson, Odesa, Mykolaiv and Mariupol as they try to cut Ukraine off from the Black Sea and establish a land corridor from Russia to Crimea, the peninsula Russia seized in 2014.

Kim said there was an upside to the strike - it suggested Russia had given up trying to take over the city.

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"" to disarm its neighbour. It denies targeting civilians and did not comment on the strike on Mykolaiv.

Ukraine and the West say Russian President Vladimir Putin launched an unprovoked invasion.

Describing the strike, Natalia Novikova, 57, an employee in the department of health in the local administration, said it was ""so noisy, people were very afraid. People all ran into the hallway and some are still sitting there because they're still scared. After that the (air-raid) sirens went off.""

Regional governor Vitaly Kim, a steadfast Putin critic, only survived because he overslept and was running late for work.

Three bodies have been pulled out of the wreckage and 18 of the wounded were recovered by rescue workers.

Several members of the Ukrainian army remain unaccounted for, according to AFP.

Kim wrote on Facebook: 'The regional administration building was hit. We're clearing the rubble. My office was hit.

'Eight civilians are still under the rubble. We hope to be able to get them out. We are also looking for three soldiers.'

The artillery strike reportedly happened as government workers streamed into the office building.

Financial Times Moscow bureau chief Max Seddon tweeted: 'A Russian airstrike took out the local government offices in Mikolayiv, southern Ukraine this morning as people were coming to work.'

Mykolaiv is about 70 miles east of Odesa, up the Southern Bug (Pivdennyi Buh) river.

It has become a frontier in Russia's invasion of Ukraine as Putin seeks to gain an access route between Crimea and target city Odesa.

Taking Odesa would mean Russia controls Ukraine's largest coastal town - and the country's only deep-water port.

Yet an effective counter-offensive by Ukrainian troops in nearby Kherson has pushed the frontline away from Mykolaiv and back towards Crimea.

Donald, 69, a retired Canadian postman living in Mykolaiv, told AFP he considers the port town 'lucky' so far.

He said: 'I was having breakfast in my apartment. I heard a whoosh then a boom and my windows rattled.

'It's scary. We have been lucky here in Mykolaiv. We haven't had that many explosions in the centre of the city.'

Despite coming under bombardment from Moscow's forces for more than a week, Ukraine's forces in Mykolaiv have foiled a Russian advancement.

Most people inside the building escaped injury - but at least a dozen were killed or entrapped

Financial Times journalist Max Seddon confirmed Kim's lucky and unplanned escape

Governor Kim said last week some Russian forces were pushed back to Kherson and that Moscow's armies have resorted to shelling the city indiscriminately, striking civilian centres.

But the medieval tactics have not diminished the resolve of the people of Mykolaiv, who have stopped Russian forces moving into the city itself.

He said last Monday: 'The forces that they sent, they thought they'd easily march through here because this was a region that didn't have enough military presence,' he told the newspaper.

'But we've showed them the opposite, with our soldiers and our civilian defence, that they have no business roaming around on our land.'

Kim has become the figurehead of Mykolaiv's resistance and has been likened among locals to president Zelensky.

Kim addresses more than 700,000 Telegram followers every few hours in a bid to inspire the city to fight back against its would-be occupiers.

He begins every video: 'Good day, we are from Ukraine' and has derided the Russian army as 'dumb'.

'They go from one direction and get bashed, they go from another direction and get bashed and then go from a third direction and get bashed as well,' he said in one address.

Although Ukrainian forces have pushed back in much of the south, Mariupol remains under severe threat of a Russian takeover in the coming days. These buses were placed as a barrier

Many residential buildings are just shells of what they once were, while the city's streets are littered with signs of warfare.

In the eastern Inhulskyi district of the city, an unexploded artillery rocket was seen sticking up from the pavement, with a traffic cone planted to warn motorists.

Glass litters the streets from shattered glass, and civilian defenders patrol with guns.

In the city's vast cemetery, another unexploded rocket burrowed into the ground nearly up to its fins.

A good part of the city's 500,000 pre-war residents have fled - mostly towards Odesa. Those that remain are determined to hold out.

In the Kulbakino district, which includes several blocks of residential buildings, the population has fallen from 12,000 to fewer than 1,000, according to Alexander Zadera, 56.

He said: 'We've got used to eating with that sort of background noise.

The US embassy has limited ability to assist US citizens in Russia, it noted.



30 Mar 2022 22.38 China’s ambassador to the UN has addressed the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, describing a “worrying account of the situation on ground” and called for the protection of civilian lives and respect for international humanitarian law.

Dai Bing told the latest UN Security Council, according to a statement released by China’s permanent mission to the UN: The conflict situation in Ukraine is persisting. Effectively protecting civilian lives and meeting their humanitarian needs is a must. China calls for respect for international humanitarian law to avoid civilian casualties to the maximum extent, protect civilian facilities, provide safe passage for evacuation and humanitarian access, and ensure a continuous supply of basic necessities, such as food, drinking water, and medicines. Protection of vulnerable groups such as women and children must be strengthened.” Increasing sanctions on Russia will “give rise to new humanitarian problems”, Bing added. We must also be cognisant that the ever-escalating, sweeping, indiscriminate sanctions have hit global energy, food, economic, trade and financial markets, and will continue to do so, affecting the lives and livelihoods of the general public, and giving rise to new humanitarian problems.” Addressing global food security, Bing called for an “enhanced international coordination” to stabilise food supply and food prices and a “refrain from unjustified export restrictions”. Sanctions and economic blockades will only artificially exacerbate food shortages and price distortions, further disrupt food production and food supply chain across the world, push up food prices, and put such burdens on developing countries as they do not deserve. We call for enhanced international coordination to stabilise food supply and food prices, refrain from unjustified export restrictions, keep the market working in a stable manner, and ensure global food security. Finally, Bing cautioned that further damage is on its way if the crisis continues and escalates, describing such an event as being “not in the interest of any party”. The most conclusive way towards a ceasefire to end hostilities is dialogue and negotiation. The international community should encourage and support continued direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine until a positive outcome is achieved and peace is restored. Security is indivisible and seeking absolute security by pitting one bloc against another is precisely the most assured way to achieve insecurity. The United States, Nato and EU should also engage in dialogue with Russia, accommodate the legitimate security concerns of all parties, and build a balanced, effective and sustainable regional security architecture through dialogue and negotiation.”

30 Mar 2022 21.43 A Russian hotel owner has taken in Ukrainians fleeing the fighting, saying it was partly the shame he feels over Russia’s invasion that persuaded him and his family to take in 34 Ukrainians so far, and counting. Mikhail Golubtsov, a Russian former construction engineer, left his home country in 2014 over Moscow’s “unacceptable” annexation of Crimea, and now runs a modest but cosy hotel in the green hills of central Serbia. Most of Golubtsov’s hotel rooms are now taken up by Ukrainian refugees, who can stay at the hotel free of charge, for as long as they need. “The first seven people arrived because a friend gave them the address, ... now they are simply arriving,” he told Reuters. “At first (after the invasion started), I was in shock and I was so ashamed. For some time I could not speak Russian, but when guests arrive and they speak Russian to me, I speak Russian as well. I think the only thing I can do now is to help Ukrainians somehow.” Russian hotel owner Mikhail Golubtsov, who owns a cozy inn in central Serbia, says it was partly the shame he feels over Russia's invasion of Ukraine that persuaded him and his family to take in Ukrainians fleeing the war https://t.co/1AlBaGUQBL pic.twitter.com/V870NpFJQW — Reuters (@Reuters) March 30, 2022



30 Mar 2022 21.36 Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskiy will address Australia’s parliament on Thursday evening by video, according to parliament records cited by Reuters. Employment minister Stuart Robert told parliament on Thursday morning that Zelenskiy would make an address via video link at 5.30pm (7.30am GMT). Australia has supplied defence equipment and humanitarian supplies to Ukraine, as well as imposing a ban on exports of alumina and aluminium ores, including bauxite, to Russia. It has also imposed a total of 476 sanctions on 443 individuals, including businessmen close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and 33 entities, including most of Russia*s banking sector and all entities responsible for the country’s sovereign debt.



30 Mar 2022 21.25 The war in Ukraine will have a global impact “beyond anything we’ve seen since World War Two” and damage global food security because many of the Ukrainian farmers who produce a significant amount of the world’s wheat are now fighting Russians, the UN’s food chief has warned. David Beasley, executive director of the UN World Food Program, told the UN Security Council that already high food prices are skyrocketing.

His agency was feeding 125 million people around the world before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Beasley said it has had to start cutting their rations because of rising food, fuel and shipping costs, the Associated Press reports. He pointed to war-torn Yemen where 8 million people just had their food allotment cut 50%, “and now we’re looking at going to zero rations.” The war in Ukraine is turning “the breadbasket of the world to breadlines” for millions of its people, while devastating countries like Egypt that normally gets 85% of its grain from Ukraine and Lebanon that got 81% in 2020, Beasley said. Ukraine and Russia produce 30% of the world’s wheat supply, 20% of its corn and 75%-80% of the sunflower seed oil. The World Food Program buys 50% of its grain from Ukraine, he said. The war is going to increase the agency’s monthly expenses by $71 million because of rising food, fuel and shipping costs, he said. That will total $850 million for a year and mean that there will be “4 million less people we’ll be able to reach.”

30 Mar 2022 21.14 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has said it is greatly concerned that Russian and Ukrainian authorities are yet to meet many of their core obligations under international humanitarian law or reach consensus on key issues. In a statement shared with the Guardian via email, a spokesperson said: Over the last five weeks, the ICRC has been speaking with Russian and Ukrainian authorities about their obligations under international humanitarian law (IHL) and what practical steps must be taken to limit the suffering of civilians and those who no longer participate in hostilities, including the wounded, sick, and prisoners of war (POWs). To the ICRC’s great concern, the parties are yet to meet many of their core obligations under IHL or reach consensus on key issues that only they can concretely deliver.” Specifically, the ICRC said it made detailed proposals regarding the safe passage and evacuations for civilians in Mariupol, but still “lack the concrete agreements needed to move forward”. People talk with a Red Cross worker next to an apartment building in Mariupol, Ukraine. Photograph: Evgeniy Maloletka/AP Today, civilians are taking the life-and-death decision to flee when there is no ceasefire or other agreements in place that would allow them to leave safely. Time is running out for civilians in Mariupol and in other frontline areas who have now gone for weeks with no humanitarian assistance. The militaries on the ground need to give civilians and humanitarian organisations security guarantees and practical agreements to allow aid in and for those who wish to evacuate safely.” The ICRC added that the parties must inform of any POWs—and other people deprived of their liberty—whom they hold and allow the ICRC to visit them. The parties need to follow through on concrete proposals for the dignified treatment of the dead so they can be identified, families informed, and bodies returned. The belligerents are obligated under international humanitarian law to protect civilians, to limit military operations to exclusively military objectives and to take precautionary measures.” According to the statement, the ICRC’s president travelled first to Kyiv and then Moscow to meet with authorities where his meetings with authorities in Moscow “triggered deep anger for some”. “We want to be clear that these diplomatic meetings with all sides are anchored in international humanitarian law and passionate advocacy for the best interest of civilians trapped in conflict,” the statement added.



30 Mar 2022 20.53 Former US president Donald Trump has called on Russian president Vladimir Putin to release any damaging information he has about the Biden family and Hunter Biden’s dealings with oligarchs in eastern Europe. “I would think Putin would know the answer to that,” Trump said in an interview with Just the News, referring to Hunter Biden’s potential dealings in Russia. “I think he should release it. I think we should know that answer.” Trump cited a 2020 Senate report that disclosed Russian oligarch Yelena Baturina, then the wife of Moscow’s mayor, provided $3.5 million a decade ago to a company co-founded by President Joe Biden’s son and unanswered questions about why the money was given. “How is it that the mayor of Moscow, his wife gave the Biden family three and a half million dollars? I think Putin now would be willing to probably give that answer,” Trump said. “I’m sure he knows.” A grand jury has been investigating Hunter Biden’s business dealings for possible tax violations, foreign lobbying issues and money laundering but he has denied any wrongdoing.



30 Mar 2022 20.26 There needs to be full peace across Ukraine for any final agreement with Russia to come into force, the head of the Ukrainian delegation said following talks with Moscow in Istanbul on Tuesday. David Arakhamia told reporters that all troops must retreat from Ukraine and allow the 3.5 million refugees who fled the war to come back home. He added that there was enough material in Ukraine’s proposals to warrant a meeting between Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Vladimir Putin.

30 Mar 2022 20.19 Russian withdrawal from north is merely a rotation of troops with aim to 'mislead', Ukraine military says Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces has just released its latest intelligence report as of 10pm local time, claiming Russian troops continue to withdraw from the territory of Kyiv and Chernihiv in the Ukraine’s north but the movement is merely “a rotation of individual units” and aims to “mislead the military leadership” of Ukraine. The report reads: According to some indications, the Russian enemy is regrouping units to focus its main efforts on the east. At the same time, the so-called ‘withdrawal of troops’ is probably a rotation of individual units and aims to mislead the military leadership of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and create a misconception about the occupiers’ refusal to plan to encircle the city of Kyiv.” Ukrainian infantry and artillery units on the outskirts of Kyiv.

29 Mar 2022 19.54 US President Joe Biden’s deputy national security adviser for economics, Daleep Singh, will travel to New Delhi and meet government officials to discuss Russia’s war against Ukraine and develop an economic framework for the Indo-Pacific, the White House said on Tuesday. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is also planning to visit India, one of the biggest buyers of Russian commodities. New Delhi has called for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine but has refused to explicitly condemn Moscow’s actions. India has also abstained from voting on multiple UN resolutions on the war. “Singh will consult closely with counterparts on the consequences of Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and mitigating its impact on the global economy,” the White House said in a statement. Last week, Biden said only India among the Quad group of countries was “somewhat shaky” in acting against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. The South Asian nation has tried to balance its ties with Russia and the west but unlike other members of the Quad countries - United States, Japan, Australia - it has not imposed sanctions on Russia.





29 Mar 2022 19.49 Earlier today, the US president said it remains to be seen if Russia will follow through on its pledge to scale down its military operations in northern Ukraine, saying Washington and its allies will maintain sanctions and continue providing aid to Ukraine in the meantime. “I don’t read anything into it until we see what their actions are,” Biden said of Russia at a White House press conference.

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.
