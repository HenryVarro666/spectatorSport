2,c140c689-0070-45b2-9ccc-9a24dcf4c2b0,"['Jeff Mason Nandita Bose', 'Jeff Mason', 'Nandita Bose']",2022-03-16 00:00:00,"WASHINGTON, March 16 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden on Wednesday said Russian President Vladimir Putin ""is a war criminal"" for attacking Ukraine and announced an additional $800 million in security assistance including weapons to take down Russian planes and tanks.

In an exchange with a reporter at the White House, Biden said, ""Oh I think he is a war criminal,"" after initially responding with a ""no"" to a question about whether he was ready to call Putin that.

That is the first time Biden has publicly branded Putin with that phrase. Last week, during a trip to Poland, Vice President Harris said Russia should ""absolutely"" be investigated for potential war crimes. read more

White House press secretary Jen Psaki later said Biden was speaking from his heart, noting there is a separate legal process to determine whether Putin has violated international law and committed war crimes, and that that process currently is underway at the State Department.

Earlier in the day, Biden said the United States has offered Ukraine $1 billion in security aid, addressing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's urgent appeal to the U.S. Congress for military help to fend off the Russian invasion. The U.S. will continue to give Ukraine weapons to fight and defend themselves, offer humanitarian relief and support Ukraine's economy with additional financial assistance, he added.

""This new package on its own is going to provide unprecedented assistance to Ukraine, and includes 800 anti-aircraft systems,"" Biden said, to halt attacks on Ukrainians by Russian planes and helicopters.

At Zelenskiy's request, Washington will help Ukraine acquire additional long-range missile anti-aircraft systems, Biden said. It will also supply 9,000 anti-armor systems, drones and 7,000 small arms such as machine guns, shotguns and grenade launchers that will help civilians fighting to defend their country.

""More will be coming as we source additional stocks of equipment that ... we are ready to transfer,"" he said.

The new funds will come from a spending bill Biden signed into law that includes $13.6 billion in new aid to Ukraine.

In his address to Congress, Zelenskiy compared the attacks in Ukraine to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that pulled the United States into World War Two, and begged lawmakers, and Biden directly, for more help.

""This is a terror that Europe has not seen for 80 years, and we are asking for our life, for an answer to this terror from the whole world. Is this a lot to ask for? To create a no-fly zone over Ukraine to save people?"" Zelenskiy asked through an interpreter.

""If this is too much to ask, we offer an alternative,"" he said. ""You know what kind of defense systems we need,"" adding that he knows the United States has them.

Biden has referred to the creation of a no-fly zone over Ukraine as ""World War Three,"" and the Pentagon has refused requests to send fighter jets to Ukraine. read more

Earlier on Wednesday, Russia and Ukraine both emphasized newfound scope for compromise as peace talks were set to resume three weeks into a Russian assault that has so far failed to topple the Ukrainian government. read more

On Tuesday, the White House said Biden will travel to Brussels for a March 24 NATO summit on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow terms a ""special military operation"" to disarm and ""denazify"" its neighbor.

Biden has ratcheted up sanctions imposed on Russia in recent days. He has called for a suspension of Russia's trading status that affords its exported products lower tariffs in the international arena and announced a ban on Russian oil and other energy imports.

3,c140c689-0070-45b2-9ccc-9a24dcf4c2b0,['Anita Powell'],,"U.S. President Joe Biden answered Ukraine’s plea for help on Wednesday with an $800 million assistance package that includes a range of weapons and defensive gear — a response that falls short of the no-fly zone Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy seeks as his country faces continued attacks from Russia.

But Biden also raised the temperature in the war of words between himself and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“I think he is a war criminal,” Biden said, speaking to journalists at an event later in the day. He did not elaborate and walked away.

In response, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the TASS news agency Biden's statement was ""unacceptable and unforgivable rhetoric.""

“The president's remarks speak for themselves,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said, when pressed for details. “He was speaking from his heart and speaking from what you've seen on television, which is barbaric actions by a brutal dictator through his invasion of a foreign country.”

Putin launched the invasion of Ukraine three weeks ago. His forces have struck hospitals, schools and homes. Zelenskyy said that about 100 children have been killed in the full-scale attack.

The new U.S. aid package “brings the total of new U.S. security assistance to Ukraine to $1 billion just this week,” Biden said.

“This new package on its own is going to provide unprecedented assistance to Ukraine,” the president added. “It includes 800 anti-aircraft systems to make sure the Ukrainian military can continue to stop the planes and helicopters that have been attacking their people and to defend their Ukrainian airspace.”

In addition to the 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems that Biden mentioned, the package includes 2,000 Javelin and 1,000 light anti-armor weapons, and 6,000 AT-4 anti-armor systems; hundreds of grenade launchers, shotguns and machine guns; thousands of rifles and pistols; more than 20 million rounds of ammunition and tens of thousands of sets of body armor and helmets.

The Pentagon Wednesday said efforts to deliver the equipment are already underway.

“We understand the tyranny of time here,” a senior U.S. defense official told reporters, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence and other sensitive matters.

“We've already started working on how to source all these all these items and get them there as quickly as possible,” the official said, noting that despite Russian threats, “things are still getting into the hands of the Ukrainians … Those routes are still open.”

The official declined to go into detail about reports that some allies, including Slovakia, are willing to provide Kyiv with the Russian-made S-300 air defense system, capable of shooting down enemy aircraft as well as some ballistic missiles and cruise missiles.

“There are air defense systems, mobile systems that that we know the Ukrainians know how to use and we also know that there are allies and partners who also possess them and might be willing to provide,” the official said. “We’re actively having those discussions.”

The new U.S. assistance package follows an impassioned plea Zelenskyy made Wednesday to U.S. lawmakers, begging them to do more to protect his nation amid a 3-week-old onslaught by Russian forces.

Watch video by VOA's Katherine Gypson:

In his speech before a joint session of Congress, Zelenskyy evoked some of the worst traumas of American history to ask the U.S. to give more military assistance and impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine’s besieged cities.

“Right now, the destiny of our country is being decided,” Zelenskyy said, speaking virtually to a packed session of U.S. lawmakers in a speech that evoked the painful memories of Japan’s 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, which spurred the U.S. to enter World War II; and the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, which launched the U.S.’s multifront, two-decades-long Global War on Terror.

The 44-year-old actor-turned-president, who spoke in English for part of his address, also raised the more inspiring parts of American history, including the words of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.

“I need to protect our sky,” Zelenskyy said. “I need your decision, your help, which means exactly the same, the same you feel when you hear the words, ‘I have a dream.’”

He reiterated his request for a no-fly zone, a request the White House has said would put the U.S. into direct confrontation with Russia.

‘Not-too-hot, not-too-cold’

Stephen Biddle, a professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University, described Biden’s response as “about the right not-too-hot, not-too-cold solution” that will help Ukraine defend itself while avoiding a confrontation between two nuclear powers.

Zelenskyy’s requests for air support “will have only a marginal effect on the military outcome in Ukraine. The primary Russian threat to Ukraine right now is not the Russian air force, which so far has been surprisingly ineffective,” Biddle said.

“Biden has the responsibility of statesmanship to resist even a powerful dramatic appeal from an immensely sympathetic hero in the form of Zelenskyy and do what we can to help, but not necessarily do everything Zelenskyy is asking him to do,” Biddle told VOA, via Skype. “Sometimes, statesmanship involves making very hard unpleasant choices, like not doing everything a brave, noble underdog ally would like you to do.”

Psaki said Biden watched Zelenskyy’s speech from the White House. She said the administration is in close contact with the Ukrainian government and that none of Zelenskyy’s requests came as a surprise.

“If we were President Zelenskyy, we would be asking for everything possible as well, and continuing to ask for it,” she said. “Because he is watching his country and his people be attacked and brutalized by President Putin and the Russian military. But how President Biden makes decisions is through the prism of our own national security, and as we've said before, a no-fly zone would require implementation, it would require us potentially shooting down Russian planes, NATO shooting down Russian planes, and we are not interested in getting into World War III.”

Instead, Washington is pursuing what officials say are harsh and effective sanctions against Russia, with a special focus on the wealthy elites who surround Russian President Vladimir Putin. To that end, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen and Attorney General Merrick Garland met virtually on Wednesday with officials from Australia, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the European Commission to launch the Russian Elites, Proxies, and Oligarchs (REPO) multilateral task force.

‘This is a lie’

Putin seems to be unfazed by the opposition, and told Russian media on Wednesday that he will continue what he describes as a “special operation” in Ukraine.

“The West is trying to convince its citizens that their difficulties are the result of Russia’s actions, but this is a lie,” Russian media reported Putin as saying.

Following a meeting with NATO defense ministers in Brussels on Wednesday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg reiterated that the alliance is “united” in holding firm in their opposition to imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine, despite Zelenskyy’s repeated calls for one.

He also said the alliance must continue to provide significant support to Ukraine, including military supplies, financial help and humanitarian aid. He also called on Russia to stop its attacks on Ukraine.

“Allies are united both in providing support to Ukraine, to support Ukraine to uphold the right for self-defense,” Stoltenberg told a press conference. “But allies are also united when it comes to that NATO should not deploy forces on the ground or in the airspace of Ukraine. Because we have a responsibility to ensure that this conflict, this war, doesn't escalate beyond Ukraine.”

Russia has objected to NATO’s presence near its borders and sought a guarantee that Ukraine will never join the alliance. NATO insists countries are free to make their own decisions about security ties.

While Ukraine is not part of NATO, seven NATO countries share borders with Russia, Ukraine or Russian ally Belarus, and that proximity has raised concerns of a wider conflict.

Stoltenberg said Wednesday there are 100,000 U.S. troops in Europe and another 40,000 troops under direct NATO command, as well as hundreds of thousands more on heightened alert across NATO nations.

Biden is to join other NATO leaders in Brussels for a summit taking place March 24, marking one month since Russia launched its invasion after denying for months it planned to do so.

On the ground in Ukraine, the country’s emergencies agency reported a 12-story residential building was among the targets hit by Russian forces. Ukrainian officials also said Russia bombed a theater in Mariupol where hundreds of people were taking shelter.

Funds also will be used to help care for the more than 3 million Ukrainians displaced by the war, while bolstering the country's defenses as Russian forces try to encircle the capital city Kyiv.

Biden called Zelenskyy's speech ""convincing and significant"" and said he listened to him from the White House private residence.

""He speaks for people who have shown remarkable courage and strength in the face of brutal aggression -- courage and strength that’s inspired not only Ukrainians but the entire world,"" Biden said. ""Putin is inflicting appalling, appalling devastation and harm on Ukraine -- bombing apartment buildings, maternity wards, hospitals. I mean, it’s -- it's God awful.""

He did not directly address Zelenskyy's emotional and direct appeal to lawmakers on Wednesday for the U.S. to back a no-fly zone the administration has repeatedly rejected -- but announced an additional $800 million in military assistance as part of the $13.6 billion aid package for Ukraine contained in the government spending bill Biden signed into law Tuesday, which includes weapons the Ukrainians have been requesting, such as anti-armor and anti-air systems.

Ahead of signing an action to approve the $800 million in additional security support, Biden said the U.S. is ""fully committed"" to getting more weapons to Ukraine.

""What’s at stake here are the principles that the United States and the United Nations and across the world stand for. It's about freedom. It’s about the right of people to determine their own future. It's about making sure Ukraine never, will never be a victory for Putin no matter what advances he makes on the battlefield,"" he said.

""The American people are answering President Zelenskyy's call for more help, more weapons for Ukraine to defend itself, more tools to fight Russian aggression. And that’s what we’re doing,"" Biden said.

While not addressing Zelenskyy's request for a humanitarian no-fly zone, Biden said the new package will supply Ukraine with 9,000 anti-armor systems, 7,000 small arms, 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems, 20 million rounds of ammunition, and 100 drones, ""so they can continue to defend their space.""

""At the request of President Zelenskyy, we have identified and are helping Ukraine acquire additional longer-range anti-aircraft systems and ammunitions for those systems,"" he said. ""And this will include drones which demonstrates our commitment to sending our most cutting-edge systems to Ukraine for its defense.""

""Now, I want to be honest with you. This could be a long and difficult battle, but the American people will be steadfast in our support of the people of Ukraine in the face of Putin’s immoral, unethical attacks on civilian populations,"" he added. ""We are united in our abhorrence of Putin’s depraved onslaught, and we are going to continue to have their backs as they fight for freedom, their democracy, their very survival -- and we are going to give Ukraine the arms to fight and defend themselves through all the difficult days ahead.""

Over the past week, the U.S. has contributed $1 billion in new assistance to Ukraine.

But White House press secretary Jen Psaki also reiterated Tuesday that the administration doesn't support Zelenskyy's no-fly zone request because the U.S. has to consider its own national security, and as Biden has repeatedly put it, does not want to enter ""World War III.""

""We have the responsibility to do here is to assess what the impact is on the United States and our own national security,"" she said.

While the U.S. has imposed a slate of economic and trade sanctions to isolate Putin, the Biden administration has also flatly rejected U.S. troops fighting Russian forces in Ukraine and any help delivering MiG-29 fighter jets that Poland wants to get to the Ukrainians.

Earlier Wednesday, to a packed auditorium of lawmakers and standing ovations, Zelenskyy seized the spotlight to push Biden to contribute more lethal aid, lawmakers to sanction more companies with ties to Russia, and said if the U.S. cannot agree to support a no-fly zone, then to give Ukraine S-300 systems and other similar weapons to defend its skies.

While the White House event allowed Biden to detail what the U.S. is doing in place of a no-fly zone, he was forced to respond to Zelenskyy's emotional appeal, in which he told Americans to remember Pearl Harbor and the 9/11 attacks when witnessing the terror in Ukraine and closed by calling out Biden by name, in English, to do more.

""It's not enough to be the leader of the nation. Today it takes to be the leader of the world,"" Zelensky said. ""Being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace. Peace in your country doesn't depend anymore only on you and your people. It depends on those next to you and those who are strong.""

In remarks on the Senate floor following Zelenskyy's address, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell criticized the Biden administration for what he's characterized as a sluggish response to the crisis in Ukraine and outlined three steps the administration should take to pick up the pace.

McConnell called on Biden to expand the scope of U.S. lethal aid to Ukraine to include more effective long-range air defense capabilities, to deploy more U.S. forces to reinforce NATO's eastern flank and use new authorities to harden the defenses of frontline allies, and finally, for Biden to go ""beyond Brussels"" on his trip next week and to visit Eastern flank, NATO allies like Poland, Romania and Lithuania.

""As the threat to Ukraine gathered whenever an opportunity to act has presented itself, the Biden administration has hesitated until the political pressure became overwhelming, or balked outright,"" McConnell said.

Although he made no direct mention of a no-fly zone, McConnell hit hard on the need to help Ukraine shore up its air defense, arguing the administration should quickly get Ukraine air defense systems ""that we should have helped Ukraine get weeks ago.""

Biden will travel to Brussels next Thursday to meet with NATO leaders in his first European visit since Russian President Vladimir Putin started invading Ukraine, the White House announced Tuesday, to meet ""face-to-face"" with his European counterparts to assess Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

6,c140c689-0070-45b2-9ccc-9a24dcf4c2b0,[],2022-03-16 00:00:00,"WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden on Wednesday approved a new $800 million security assistance package for Ukraine, bringing U.S. military aid to the war-torn country to $1 billion since last week.

""The world is united in our support for Ukraine and our determination to make Putin pay a very heavy price. America's leading this effort, together with our allies and partners, providing an enormous level of security and humanitarian assistance that we're adding to today,” Biden said in a public address from the White House.

The $800 million is the highest amount given in a single security assistance package to Ukraine and will include weapons to help defend Ukrainian airspace from Russian attacks, the president said.

“This new package on its own is going to provide unprecedented assistance to Ukraine,” Biden said. “It includes 800 [Stinger]anti-aircraft systems to make sure the Ukrainian military can continue to stop the planes and helicopters that have been attacking their people and to defend the Ukrainian airspace.""

The White House said the assistance package also includes 2,000 Javelin anti-tank systems, 1,000 light anti-armor weapons and 6,000 AT-4 anti-armor systems.

Biden said sending 9,000 “portable, high-accuracy, shoulder-mounted” anti-armor systems will help because Ukrainians “have already been using [such systems] with great effect to destroy invading tanks and armored vehicles.”

The package will also include 100 tactical drones, which Biden said demonstrates the U.S. “commitment to sending our most cutting-edge systems to Ukraine for its defense.”

Additionally, the U.S. will provide 7,000 small arms, such as machine guns, shotguns, grenade launchers and about 20 million rounds of ammunition, and 25,000 sets of body armor and helmets, according to the White House.

The announcement came hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asked Congress for such systems to strike down Russian air assaults.

Biden called Zelenskyy’s speech “convincing and significant,” and he said the U.S. has “identified and are helping Ukraine acquire additional longer-range and aircraft systems and the munitions for those systems.”

During his address to Congress, Zelenskyy pleaded for the U.S. to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine, but said the U.S. could instead send surface-to-air missile systems to help secure the skies against Russian assaults.

“If this is too much to ask, we offer an alternative: You know what kind of defense systems we need, S-300 and other similar [surface-to-air missile] systems,” he said. “You know how much depends on the battlefield on [Russia’s] ability to use aircraft.""

The U.S. opposes a no-fly zone over Ukraine because it would put U.S. forces in direct contact with Russian forces. Biden has repeatedly pledged not to send American service members into the country to fight the Russians.

Zelenskyy also said Ukraine needs “powerful, strong, aviation to protect our people, our freedom.”

“Lend [us] aircraft that can help Ukraine, help Europe,” he said. “You know that they exist and you have them, but they are not in Ukraine in the Ukrainian sky.”

The comment came after the U.S. declined last week to accept Polish fighter jets to transfer to Ukraine.

The Pentagon on March 9 rejected a plan offered by Poland to donate its fleet of MiG-29 fighter jets to the U.S. to transfer to Ukraine, chief Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said at the time.

“The intelligence community has assessed the transfer of MiG-29s to Ukraine may be mistaken as escalatory and could result in significant Russian reaction that might increase the prospects of a military escalation with NATO,” he said.

Aside from the “high-risk,” the U.S. believes fighter jets are not among “the systems that [Ukrainian forces] need most to defeat Russian aggression,” Kirby said, noting the Ukrainian air force still had “several squadrons of fully mission-capable aircraft.”

As of Tuesday, Ukraine and Russia still had 90% of its combat power available, a senior defense official said.

“We assess that adding aircraft to the Ukrainian inventory is not likely to significantly change the effectiveness of Ukrainian air force relative to Russian capabilities,” Kirby said March 9. “Therefore, we believe that the gain from transferring those MiG-29s is low.”

With the new package, U.S. has now given about $2 billion in security assistance packages to Ukraine in the past year, and more than $6.4 billion since Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014, according to the State Department.

The White House on Wednesday for the first time named some of the weapons that the U.S. has sent in previous Ukrainian security assistance packages. Until now, the administration had kept the details of its packages mostly secret.

Previous packages included 600 Stingers, 2,600 Javelins, five Mi-17 helicopters, three patrol boats, four counter-artillery and counter-drone tracking radars, four counter-mortar radar systems, 200 grenade launchers and ammunition, as well as 200 shotguns and machine guns, 40 million rounds of small arms ammunition and more than 1 million grenade, mortar and artillery rounds, according to the statement.

The U.S. also has sent military vehicles that include 70 high-mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicles, secure communications and electronic warfare detection systems, tactical gear, military medical supplies, explosive ordnance disposal and de-mining equipment, and satellite imagery and analysis capabilities, the White House said.

Biden on Tuesday signed into law a funding bill that allotted $3.5 billion to the Pentagon to help resupply U.S. military stocks of equipment already given out in security assistance packages, Defense Department spokesman Christopher Sherwood said.

The funds signed into law Tuesday will now allow the Pentagon to move “expeditiously” to deliver Biden’s new security assistance package, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement Wednesday.",https://www.stripes.com/theaters/us/2022-03-16/ukraine-russia-war-military-aid-biden-5365690.html

WASHINGTON (AP) — Just hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivered an emotional plea to the U.S. Congress for more military aid, President Joe Biden laid out a wide range of weapons and equipment that America will provide to help Ukraine beat back the Russian invasion.

The new $800 million aid package centers on weapons that the Ukrainian military has already been using effectively against the Russians. And it includes air defense systems urgently needed to defend cities from the overwhelming barrage of missiles being launched by Russian forces.

A key element of that was Biden’s vow to help Ukraine get long-range air defense systems that aren’t made in America — a likely reference to the Russian-made S-300s or similar surface-to-air missile systems which other NATO nations in Eastern Europe have. Such systems are highly effective and can shoot down aircraft and intercept ballistic missiles.

A senior defense official said Wednesday that the U.S. will provide the Ukrainians with systems that they know how to use, that they’re already trained and equipped to use, and that they are using with effect. Those include air defense systems that allies and partners possess and might be willing to send to Ukraine, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal talks. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will be in Slovakia on Thursday and is expected to discuss this issue with officials there.

Left off the list for Ukraine were two things that Zelenskyy has repeatedly requested, but the U.S. and NATO have firmly rejected: Russian made MiG-29 fighter jets funneled to Ukraine via the U.S., and the establishment of a no-fly zone over Ukraine. The West believes that doing either could trigger a wider war with Russia.

Stephen Biddle, a professor of international affairs at Columbia University, said that although there is risk in providing Ukraine with weapons, it entails less risk than allowing NATO territory to be used for flying MiG fighters into Ukraine or for enforcing a no-fly zone. He noted that Germany did not attack the United States to prevent tanks, bombers and other weaponry from reaching Britain under the Lend Lease program in the years of World War II.

“Nothing about the Ukraine war is risk-free -- the issue is now balancing risks that cannot be avoided,” Biddle said. “The more lethal the arms we transfer the greater the risk, but there is also risk in allowing Putin to steamroller Ukraine.”
