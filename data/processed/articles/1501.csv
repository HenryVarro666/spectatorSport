Russia has dropped cluster bombs on Ukraine’s second biggest city, which descend by parachute to cause devastation over a wide area or are designed to seek out the heat of people and vehicles, according to local officials.

Residents in Kharkiv have been told to take refuge in shelters and underground stations and not to approach the so-called parachute bombs, which have been found across the city.

Several homes in residential areas are reported to have been destroyed by the hollow shells, which contain multiple smaller explosive “submunitions” intended to cause indiscriminate casualties and damage.

Such submunitions either have “primitive thermal-homing heads” that direct them towards the heat of armoured vehicles or civilian cars, or have no guidance systems and scatter over a wide area hitting",https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/cluster-bombs-dropped-by-parachute-on-kharkiv-ukraines-second-city-q6xtbj97h

Lyudmila Denisova, the Ukrainian Parliament’s Commissioner for Human Rights, claimed on Monday that Russian troops dropped cluster bombs on Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, and villages bordering the Donbas region in the east.

“[Russian fascists] are using majorly destructive weapons against peaceful Ukrainians. In Kharkiv, the enemy is using munitions prohibited by international conventions,” she wrote in a post shared on Facebook.

Ms Denisova added that “particularly dangerous mines with delayed detonation” were discovered in the Kharkiv suburbs of Dergachi, Yemtsi and Bezruky on Monday “which explode within hours, even if they have not been detonated by a collision with a target”.

Ukraine’s Commissioner for Human Rights also claimed that Russian troops fired several cluster bombs at villages on the borders with Donetsk and Kherson in the east of the country, some of which were “scattered in courtyards of houses and streets”.

One man is reported to have been killed in Dnipro after picking up a cluster bomb which exploded.

Cluster munitions are weapons containing dispensers that scatter submunitions or bomblets over wide areas when they detonate. They are banned under all circumstances by the UN’s Geneva Conventions.

Cluster bombs can cause significant civilian casualties both during wars and long after conflicts end because many submunitions are unreliable and fail to explode upon initial impact.

Ms Denisova accused President Putin of “war crimes and crimes against humanity” as she called for an official investigation by the UN’s Human Rights Council, from which Russia was expelled last week.

It comes as President Volodymyr Zelensky warned of a major new offensive in the east of Ukraine in the coming days which will mark the “most crucial” phase of the war to date.

Newly-released satellite images showed an eight-mile-long convoy of Russian armored vehicles and trucks with towed artillery moving east of Kharkiv.

A series of airstrikes killed at least 11 people in the city on Sunday including a child, according to Oleg Synegubov, the regional governor.

It comes after a senior US intelligence official warned last night that a newly-appointed general in command of Russia’s military campaign in the east will likely usher in a fresh round of “crimes and brutality” against civilians.

Aleksandr Dvornikov, who will oversee Russia’s new military strategy focusing on “liberating” the east of Ukraine, was responsible for widespread atrocities by Kremlin forces in Syria.

The UK’s Ministry of Defence also warned that Russia could unleash phosphorus bombs on the southern port city of Mariupol, where more than 130,000 civilians are thought to still be trapped.

The use of phosphorus bombs is banned in civilian areas. They behave the same way as incendiary weapons and are noted for the “severity of the injuries” they cause, according to Human Rights Watch.

President Zelensky said on Monday that “tens of thousands of people” have already died in the besieged city due to indiscriminate violence by Russian troops.

Russian forces have been attempting to capture the strategic port of Mariupol for more than 40 days, but have been met with a fierce Ukrainian resistance.

“Mariupol has been destroyed, there are tens of thousands of dead, but even despite this, the Russians are not stopping their offensive,” President Zelensky said in a video address to South Korea’s Parliament.

Elsewhere, Russia was accused of leaving booby-traps and explosive devices as troops withdrew from the suburbs surrounding Kyiv last week.

Denys Monastyrsky, the Ukrainian interior minister, said Russian soldiers hid bombs in washing machines and the boots of cars after fleeing the capital for the east.

“Wherever the occupiers stayed overnight, they would set up tripwires — both at the doorstep and by the fences. Our people are now also finding explosives in houses and apartments where Ukrainian police officers, rescuers, and military servicemen live,” he told Ukrainian TV on Monday.

i revealed that Russian soldiers also left graffiti across the Chernobyl exclusion zone saying: “This passage is mined” and “expect a surprise, look for a mine”, according to footage collected by the Ukrainian Witness media group.

Ukraine’s State Emergency Service said on Monday that almost half of the country will have to be demined after the war. Spokesperson Oleh Bondar said up to 300,000 square kilometers of Ukrainian soil “needs to be examined and possibly demined”.",https://inews.co.uk/news/russia-illegal-weapons-civilians-troops-cluster-bombs-ukraine-1568861

This is the fourth death in the region due to such shells. Several times, Russian occupiers fired cluster bombs at villages on the border of Donetsk and Kherson regions,"" the ombudsman said in Telegram channel on Monday.

In addition, according to Denisova, in Derhachi, Yemtsi and Bezruki, Kharkiv region, especially dangerous delayed-detonation mines have recently been discovered that explode within several hours, even if they were not blown up by a collision with a target.

""Ammunition with a plastic case, small in size, weighing about one and a half kilogram, is scattered around the yards of residential buildings and streets,"" the commissioner for human rights said.

The ombudsman once again draws attention to the fact that the use of such types of weapons of mass destruction against civilians is a crime against humanity, a war crime and a violation of the Geneva Conventions of 1949.

The convention has yet to be signed by Russia or Ukraine, both of which possess cluster munitions.

In 2014, during the invasion of Crimea, Russia used similar weapons in Syria and Ukraine.

Since early March, Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, has been subjected to severe Russian shelling.

On Telegram, the press department of Kharkiv City Council said: ""For the past month and a half, the enemy has been attacking Kharkiv. Kharkiv has been bombarded with a new sort of bombing in the last two days, in addition to mines, shells, and Grad systems.

Igor Terekhov, the mayor of Kharkiv, urged inhabitants to seek refuge in bomb shelters and subway stations, particularly at night.

He also revealed that since the assault began, 1,716 residential buildings have been demolished throughout the city.

On April 8, eyewitnesses reported seeing parachute bombs on the outskirts of the city, with at least seven residential homes being damaged.

A five-story skyscraper in Kharkiv was also thought to have been bombed the next day.

Shells were seen dropping from the sky on parachutes, according to witnesses. Multiple rocket launchers may drop such landmines, according to sappers who investigated the site.

The officials of the Kharkiv area claimed on Saturday morning that Russians were shooting at the districts of Kharkiv and its outskirts 50 times per day.
