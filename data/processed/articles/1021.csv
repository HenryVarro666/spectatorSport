PARIS, April 4 (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said on Monday that a new round of sanctions targetting Russia were needed and that there were clear indications Russian forces were responsible for the killings of civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha.

""There are very clear clues pointing to war crimes. It is more or less established that the Russian army is responsible (for the Bucha killings),"" Macron told France Inter radio.

""What happened in Bucha demands a new round of sanctions and very clear measures,"" Macron added.

Those new sanctions should target coal and oil, said Macron who faces a re-election battle this month.

Russia on Sunday denied its forces were responsible for the deaths of civilians in the town of Bucha and said Ukraine had staged a performance for the Western media.

Russia's economy is facing the gravest crisis since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union after the United States and its allies imposed crippling sanctions due to Putin's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.

French President Emmanuel Macron has expressed support for banning Russian oil and coal as part of a new round of sanctions against Russia, after reports emerged of mass graves and atrocities in the town of Bucha, a town outside Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv.

“What happened in Bucha demands a new round of sanctions and very clear measures,” Macron told France Inter radio on Monday, adding that there were “very clear indications of war crimes”.

Macron, who faces a re-election battle this week, said new sanctions targeting the oil and coal industries would be “particularly” painful for Russia.

France will coordinate such steps with its European Union partners, “especially Germany”, in the coming days, he said, adding that the bloc could also impose further sanctions against Russian individuals.

The EU had been weighing a possible ban on Russian crude imports, though some members including Germany, which is heavily reliant on imports from Moscow, opposed such a move.

However, outrage at the evidence emerging from Kyiv province following the departure of Russian forces could prompt the EU to cut its gas dependence on Russia, which provides some 45 percent of its needs. Russia also accounts for about 25 percent of oil imports and 45 percent of coal imports, according to the European Commission.

After Ukrainian forces regained control of Bucha on March 31, images of bodies lying on the streets – including some with their hands bound behind their backs – sent shockwaves through international capitals.

Local authorities said they had been forced to dig communal graves to bury the dead accumulating in the streets.

“The scenes are unbearable. International justice must work. Those who were behind these crimes must respond,” Macron said.

Russia’s defence ministry has denied Ukraine’s accusation that it carried out a “massacre”. Russia’s chief investigator ordered an official examination of what he called a Ukrainian “provocation”.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also said Russian “experts at the Ministry of Defence have identified signs of video fakes and various fakes” and urged international leaders to “not rush to sweeping accusations and at least listen to our arguments”.

Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of FX Research at Commerzbank, told the Reuters news agency more sanctions would heighten the risk of energy disruptions in Europe “because of our own sanctions or because Russia might get completely serious with its counter-sanctions, rather than just changing the payment mode for natural gas”.

“In my view, the risk of significant euro weakness increases,” he said.

Macron told France Inter radio on Monday that more sanctions are needed against Russia in response to the photos of what appear to be executions in the town northwest of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.

Photos surfaced over the weekend of bodies on the streets of the suburb. One person photographed had their hands tied behind their back with a white cloth. Russia’s defense ministry has claimed that the images are “fakes,” according to Tass news agency.

“There are very clear clues pointing to war crimes. It is more or less established that the Russian army is responsible [for the Bucha killings],” Macron said, according to Reuters.

“What happened in Bucha demands a new round of sanctions and very clear measures,” he added.

The French president said the penalties against Russia should take aim at coal and oil.

The EU’s foreign policy chief, Joseph Borrell, struck a similar note, writing in a statement that the 27-member bloc “will continue to firmly support Ukraine and will advance, as a matter of urgency, work on further sanctions against Russia.”

Borrell also condemned the “reported atrocities” carried out by Russian forces in occupied Ukrainian towns that have since been liberated.

“Haunting images of large numbers of civilian deaths and casualties, as well as destruction of civilian infrastructures show the true face of the brutal war of aggression Russia is waging against Ukraine and its people,” Borrell wrote.

“The massacres in the town of Bucha and other Ukrainian towns will be inscribed in the list of atrocities committed on European soil,” he added.

Macron and Borrell are two of a number of high-ranking international figures that have spoken out against the images from Bucha. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday said the photos were “a punch to the gut,” and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg called them “horrific.”

Additionally, leaders from several countries have called for harsher action against Russia in response to the Bucha images.

""What just happened in Bucha requires a new set of sanctions and very clear measures,"" Macron told radio station France Inter. ""I'm in favor of having a sanctions package, especially on coal and oil, which we know are particularly painful. I want us to be able to act.""

Reports over the weekend that Russian forces massacred and raped Ukrainian civilians in villages and towns near Kyiv, including Bucha, prompted calls for tougher sanctions against Moscow.

Macron said France will ""coordinate with our European partners, especially Germany,"" but also ""take additional individual measures.""

German Economy and Climate Minister Robert Habeck on Sunday continued to rule out an immediate ban on Russian oil, gas and coal, saying the move would harm the EU more than Moscow.

But German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht called for a potential ban on Russian gas to be discussed at the EU level. ""There has to be a response,"" she said. ""Such crimes must not remain unanswered.""

The bloc's new sanctions package is expected to be discussed at a meeting of EU finance ministers in Luxembourg on Monday and Tuesday, a French economy ministry official said Monday.

""All options are on the table,"" the official said, adding that the European Commission may also use the meeting to brief ministers on ""the avenues it is considering in terms of additional sanctions.""

Russia will respond proportionately to the expulsion of its diplomats from a number of Western countries, Russian ex-president and deputy head of security council Dmitry Medvedev said late on Monday.

“Everyone knows the answer: it will be symmetrical and destructive for bilateral relations,” Medvedev said in a posting on his Telegram channel.

“Who have they punished? First of all, themselves.”

On Monday, France said it would expel 35 Russian diplomats over Moscow’s actions in Ukraine and Germany declared “significant number” of Russian diplomats as undesirable.

“If this continues, it will be fitting, as I wrote back on 26th February – to slam shut the door on Western embassies,” Medvedev said. “It will be cheaper for everyone. And then we will end up just looking at each other in no other way than through gunsights.”

The European Union ""will advance, as a matter of urgency, work on further sanctions against Russia"", foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a statement on behalf of the bloc.

09:49am: Russia orders probe of Ukrainian 'provocation' over civilian deaths in Bucha

Russia's chief investigator on Monday ordered an official examination of what he called a Ukrainian ""provocation"" after Kyiv accused the Russian military of massacring civilians in the town of Bucha.

Alexander Bastrykin, head of the Russian Investigative Committee, ordered that a probe be opened on the basis that Ukraine had spread ""deliberately false information"" about Russian armed forces in Bucha, the committee said in a statement.

08:44am: Macron says wants fresh sanctions against Russia

07:40am: Russia says footage in Ukraine's Bucha was 'ordered' to blame Russia

Russia's foreign ministry said that footage of dead civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha had been ""ordered"" by the United States as part of a plot to blame Russia.

""Who are the masters of provocation? Of course the United States and NATO,"" ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in an interview on state television late on Sunday.

Zakharova said the immediate Western outcry over the images of dead civilians indicated the story had been part of a plan to sully Russia's reputation.

""In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements (about Russia) were made in the first minutes after these materials appeared leaves no doubt as to who 'ordered' this story.""

Moscow has called for a special UN Security Council meeting Monday to address claims that Russian forces committed atrocities against Ukrainian civilians in Bucha, a town outside Kyiv.

""In the light of heinous provocation of Ukrainian radicals in #Bucha Russia requested a meeting of UN #SecurityCouncil on Monday April 4,"" Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russia's deputy ambassador to the United Nations, said Sunday on Twitter.

Ukraine and Western leaders have erupted in outrage over the discovery of mass graves and hundreds of dead people in Bucha, a small town northwest of Kyiv. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky directly blamed Moscow for the ""killings"" of civilians.

Russia denied the accusations and said Kyiv staged footage of the corpses.

A senior Washington official swiftly slammed Moscow's UN move and said it was designed to ""feign outrage.""

“The scenes are unbearable. International justice must work. Those who were behind these crimes must respond,” he said.

Local authorities said they had been forced to dig communal graves to bury the dead accumulating in the streets, including some found with their hands bound behind their backs, in scenes that sent shockwaves through international capitals more than a month into Russia's invasion.

Macron called for progress on further moves towards sanctions at the European Union level which he said could target the Russian oil and coal industries.

“What happened in Bucha makes a new round of sanctions, and very clear measures, necessary,” Macron said.

France would coordinate such steps with its EU partners, “especially Germany,” in the coming days, he said.

Macron said that targeting the oil and coal industries would be “particularly” painful for Russia.

The EU could also impose further sanctions against Russian individuals, Macron added.

Europe is united in its outrage over evidence of Russian atrocities in Ukraine. But the European Union is not sure what it is willing to do about it, especially when it comes to energy. As photographs of bodies in the streets of the town of Bucha circulated online over the weekend, horrified Ukrainian and European officials called for the E.U. to finally stop buying Russian oil and gas.

Every barrel of oil and ton of gas is “soaked in the blood” of those killed, the speaker of Ukraine’s parliament said. Lithuania’s foreign minister warned other E.U. countries not to become “accomplices.”

With scenes of the devastation splashed across newspapers, French President Emmanuel Macron said Monday that indications of “war crimes” in Ukraine warranted new sanctions. The Élysée later confirmed that France would back an embargo on Russian oil and coal and that the proposals will be discussed on a European level on Wednesday.

German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said Sunday that what happened in Bucha had put energy sanctions on the table, but other German leaders later suggested an energy embargo is unlikely — prompting Poland’s prime minister to call out Berlin for being an E.U. holdout.

The whole debate raises uncomfortable questions about where the E.U. draws its red lines on Russian energy — if those lines exist at all.

“If there is a red line, it probably hasn’t been crossed for Germany,” said Marcel Dirsus, a German political scientist and nonresident fellow at the Institute for Security Policy at Kiel University.

In the weeks since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the E.U. has worked with the United States and other allies to hit Russia with sanctions packages, but it continues to buy Russian oil and gas.

When the United States and Britain cut imports, the E.U. argued that it could not afford to match the moves because the bloc is vastly more dependent on Russian energy. Europe imports about 40 percent of its gas and more than a quarter of its oil from Russia; the United States and Britain import far less.

Rather than stop the purchases immediately, the E.U. vowed to wean itself off Russian imports, promising to cut gas imports by two-thirds this year as part of a gradual move away from Russian fossil fuels.

The Baltic states and some Eastern European countries have called for the E.U. to do more, while major E.U. economies, including Germany, Italy and France, have opposed such calls.

But the scenes from Bucha could be a turning point. Italy’s foreign minister said Monday that the country will not veto sanctions on Russian gas.

“It is very clear that there are indications of war crimes,” Macron said in an interview with France Inter radio station. “I don’t think we can let it go. … What happened in Bucha dictates a new package of sanctions.”

Macron said more forceful sanctions are necessary to prevent similar devastation in other parts of Ukraine. “We are going to coordinate with our European partners, in particular with Germany,” he said. “In regards to coal and oil, we need to be able to move forward.”

But Macron and an Élysée official did not mention Russian natural gas, suggesting that an embargo on it may still be considered too contentious.

Macron, who is up for reelection, has advocated in favor of tougher measures on Russia, even as he has continued to hold talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in recent weeks.

In France, the debate over imposing sanctions on energy imports from Russia comes less than a week before the first round of the presidential election Sunday, which according to polls could lead to a runoff vote between Macron and far-right leader Marine Le Pen.

Both Macron and Le Pen have seen their standing in the polls improve in the wake of the Ukraine war, with Macron benefiting from his role on the international stage and Le Pen portraying herself as being more attuned to voters’ concerns over how the war will affect the purchasing power of the French.

Le Pen on Monday echoed Macron’s comments on Bucha, characterizing the destruction as a probable “war crime,” but she has called for more restraint in imposing sanctions on Russia.

The far-right leader, who was long seen as an ally of Putin, said last month that France “must choose sanctions that are not sanctions against the purchasing power of the French.”

France depends less on Russian gas than does neighboring Germany, but the ripple effects of a halt in imports from Russia could still have a significant impact on Europe’s deeply intertwined economies.

The revelations renewed pressure on German leaders, who vowed to mount a serious response but are still debating how far they are willing to go.

Lambrecht, the defense minister, said Sunday that the E.U. should discuss halting gas supplies from Russia. The youth wings of the Social Democratic Party and the Free Democratic Party — two parties in Germany’s three-way coalition government — threw their weight behind stopping deliveries of Russian fossil fuels.

But on Monday, a spokeswoman for the economics and climate ministry reiterated that an immediate embargo was unrealistic. “Unfortunately, it is the case that Germany is strongly dependent on Russian imports, and this was not reduced in the past 10 years but rather increased,” Beate Baron told reporters.

As calls mounted for Germany to cut itself off from Russian energy supplies, Monday also brought a stark reminder of the competing pressure on the government. Christian Sewing, the Deutsche Bank chief executive and president of the Association of German Banks, or BdB, said halting imports of oil and gas would make a recession “virtually unavoidable.”

But Germany did move Monday to take control of a subsidiary of Russian energy company Gazprom, three days after the St. Petersburg-based company said it was abandoning business in Germany. In addition to announcing that move, the economics and climate minister, Robert Habeck of the Green Party, said new sanctions could target people around Putin as well as Russian financial institutions. He also said Germany should expand its weapons deliveries to Ukraine — a remarkable position for a leader of the Green Party, given its pacifist roots.

The government declined to comment on allegations from Poland’s prime minister that Germany is the main roadblock to tougher sanctions.

“There is widespread outrage in Germany, and German politicians will be forced to do something, but they don’t want to do something that will hurt Germany,” Dirsus said. “There are no good options left. Massive sanctions would do damage to Germany. But do nothing and you are complicit.”

Russia has demanded that “unfriendly countries” pay for gas in rubles, or risk getting no gas at all. “You almost get the impression that they want Putin to pull the plug for them,” Dirsus added. “Pressure would die down and they wouldn’t be responsible for all the misery.”

Austria’s finance minister, Magnus Brunner, on Monday threw cold water on proposals to overhaul sanctions in response to scenes from Bucha, saying it was important to “keep a cool head.” Sanctions, he said, “must not affect us more than Russia.”

“That’s why we are, together with Germany, very reluctant about a gas embargo,” he told reporters as he arrived in Luxembourg for a meeting of E.U. finance ministers.

A statement from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen published Monday following a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the E.U. has set up a Joint Investigation Team with Ukraine to collect evidence and investigate war crimes and crimes against humanity — but did not mention sanctions.
