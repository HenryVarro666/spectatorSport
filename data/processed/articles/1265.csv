France's Macron says he is helping launch new evacuation effort in Mariupol France is helping launch a new evacuation effort in Mariupol, the southern Ukrainian port city that has been devastated after weeks of Russian bombardment, French President Emmanuel Macron said Friday. Speaking at the European Union Summit, Macron said the operation is being organized with Turkey and Greece “to evacuate all those who want to leave.” Macron said there had been discussions about the effort with the city’s mayor, and he planned on discussing it with Russian President Vladimir Putin within the next two days, he said. Some previous plans to help civilians flee the besieged city have worked, though several others have failed. Ukrainian officials have accused Russian forces of shelling escape routes and capturing those fleeing the city. Officials in Mariupol said earlier Friday that roughly 300 people had died when Russian forces bombed a theater where more than 1,000 people were hiding earlier this month. NBC News has not independently verified the claim and Russia has denied targeting civilians. Share this -

Russian forces will refocus on 'complete liberation' of separatist Donbas region, military official says Russian forces have completed “the first stage” of what President Vladimir Putin has described as a “special military operation” in Ukraine and will now focus on the separatist Donbas region, a Russian military official said Friday. Speaking on the state-owned news channel Russia-24, Col. Gen. Sergei Rudskoy, deputy chief of staff of Russia’s armed forces, said his country’s military is aiming for the “complete liberation” of the region. The Russian-backed breakaway “republics” of Donetsk and Luhansk have been involved in a low-intensity conflict with Ukrainian forces since 2014, when Russia also annexed Crimea. More than 14,000 people were killed in the conflict before Russia's invasion last month. Rudskoy’s comments come just over a month after Russia’s invasion began — and as its armed forces appeared to settle on a strategy of relentless assault after its military was hobbled by bad planning and stiff resistance from Ukrainians. A NATO official said the organization estimates that between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian troops have died and tens of thousands more have been injured, captured or gone missing. Rudosky claimed that Ukraine’s ability to fight has been “significantly reduced, which makes it possible, once again, to focus the main efforts on achieving the main goal: the liberation of Donbas.” Read the full story here.

Russia no longer in full control of Kherson, official says Russian troops are no longer in full control of the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson after a counterattack by Ukrainian forces, a senior U.S. Defense Department official said Friday. Russian forces captured Kherson in the first week of its invasion, the first major city to be captured after invading the country last month. “We can’t corroborate exactly who is in control of Kherson, but the point is, it doesn’t appear to be as solidly in Russian control as it was before. The Ukrainians are trying to take Kherson back,” the official told reporters. “We would argue that Kherson is actually contested territory again.” There was now ""heavy fighting"" underway in Kherson, the official said. The news came after U.S., British and Ukrainian officials said Ukrainian troops had stymied Russia's assault on the capital, Kyiv, and pushed back the Russians in some areas around the city. If Russia lost Kherson in the south, it would represent a major battlefield setback and complicate any attempt by it to capture the Black Sea port of Odesa, the Defense Department official said. If the Ukrainians took back Kherson, “that would be a significant development, no question about that,” the official added. Share this -







Russia sending reinforcements to Ukraine, U.S. official says The Russian military has started to move reinforcements to Ukraine from Georgia, a senior U.S. defense official said Friday. It was the first time Russia had deployed additional troops to Ukraine after having massed more than 150,000 forces around Ukraine before invading the country a month ago. The defense official told reporters in a phone briefing that “we've seen our first indication that they [Russians] are trying to send in some reinforcements from Georgia.” “So we have seen the movement of some number of troops from Georgia. We don't have any exact numbers,” the official said. Russia invaded Georgia in 2008 and has kept troops in two secessionist areas, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Pentagon officials had indicated previously that Russia appeared to be considering bringing in more troops and supplies to bolster its forces in Ukraine. The move underscored how Russia’s attack on Ukraine has failed to produce a swift victory and has been plagued by logistical and communication problems, despite Russia’s overwhelming advantage in troop numbers and firepower.

A total of 1,081 civilians have been killed, including children, and 1,707 have been injured in regions around Ukraine, according to the United Nations.

The United Nations said it believes the actual figures are “considerably higher” given information delays and many reports pending confirmation. It also said a report from the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine said that as of 8 a.m. local time Friday, 135 children had been killed and 184 injured.

She is now trying to survive in western Ukraine, where she described her new reality in stark terms.

She said that trucks were bringing water to some regions, but stomach illnesses and other ailments were rampant ""because people can't even wash their hands.""

U.N. rights office says evidence growing of Mariupol mass graves The head of the U.N. human rights team in Ukraine said Friday that monitors had received more information about mass graves in the besieged port city of Mariupol, including one that appeared to hold 200 bodies. ""We have got increasing information on mass graves that are there,"" Matilda Bogner told journalists by video link from Ukraine, saying some of the evidence came from satellite images. The U.N. rights office, which has some 50 staff in the country, has so far counted 1,035 civilian deaths since Russia invaded Feb. 24. But verification difficulties meant that toll included ""very few"" from Mariupol, which has been under heavy bombardment for weeks, Bogner said. Bogner's team is probing alleged human rights violations, such as reports that Russian forces had shot and killed civilians in their cars as they were fleeing; dozens of cases of disappearances of Ukrainian officials and journalists; and the forced movement of civilians into Russian-held territory. Russia, which has called its actions since Feb. 24 a ""special operation"", has denied targeting civilians in Ukraine. Bogdan said her team have also received reports of violations by Ukrainian forces including indiscriminate shelling in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine, and two alleged killings of civilians due to their perceived support for Russia. Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly said that they have never targeted civilians, adding that the people who are in Donetsk and Luhansk are Ukrainians. Share this -

Ukraine asks E.U. to block land and sea transport with Russia and Belarus Ukraine has appealed to the European Union to completely block land and sea transport with Russia and Belarus and to prohibit the movements of goods, its ministry of infrastructure said Friday. In a statement on Facebook, it said that ""despite the restrictive measures already in place, Russian businesses are finding workarounds and continuing to operate in other countries.” It proposed that the European Commission prohibit the provision of custom services for goods delivered to the two countries. “These measures are necessary to stop the supply to the aggressor country of dual-use goods that can be used for military purposes,” it said. Earlier, the ministry had called on the E.U. to shut its ports for Russian and Belarusian related companies and demanded closure of the road network for their carriers, it said. Share this -







Israel tries to leverage Russia ties to try to end war in Ukraine JERUSALEM — On the surface, it seems like a doomed diplomatic gambit — the untested leader of Israel, which is known for its unresolved conflict with the Palestinians and wars with its neighbors, tries to help end the most serious combat in Europe since the end of World War II. That’s what happened when Prime Minister Naftali Bennett flew to Moscow on Feb. 26, a Saturday, two days after Russia invaded Ukraine, despite being an observant Jew for whom travel on the Sabbath is forbidden unless it’s a matter of life and death. Once there, he met with President Vladimir Putin for three hours in a bid to help end the war. Leaders from other top negotiator countries — NATO members France, Germany and Turkey — have spoken with Putin only by phone, according to Michael Oren, former Israeli ambassador to the United States. Israel, which has failed to negotiate a two-state resolution with the Palestinians, could seem poorly cast as a diplomatic powerhouse in efforts to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The close ally of Washington has also been criticized for not having taken a stronger stance and joining many of its Western allies in sanctioning Russia. Read full story. Share this -

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

How you can help: Here are ways those in the U.S. can help support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.

Spotify said it expected to have fully suspended its service in Russia by early April, after working through operational obstacles.

More than 1,080 civilians killed, 1,707 injured in Ukraine as of Thursday, United Nations says As of Thursday, more than 1,080 civilians have been killed and another more than 1,700 have been injured following Russia’s attack on Ukraine, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a statement Friday. A total of 1,081 civilians have been killed, including children, and 1,707 have been injured in regions around Ukraine, according to the United Nations. Most of the civilian deaths and injuries were caused “by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes,” it said. The United Nations said it believes the actual figures are “considerably higher” given information delays and many reports pending confirmation. It also said a report from the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine said that as of 8 a.m. local time Friday, 135 children had been killed and 184 injured. NBC News has not independently verified the number of casualties.

Biden speaks to troops in Poland: ‘We’re at an inflection point’ Biden on Friday traveled to southeastern Poland where he met with U.S. troops before a scheduled meeting with aid workers assisting refugees in a country on the front lines of the humanitarian and military crisis unfolding in Ukraine. “What you’re engaged in is much more than just whether or not you can alleviate the pain and suffering of the people in Ukraine. We’re in a new phase, your generation, we’re at an inflection point,” Biden told the troops. Biden spoke with the U.S. troops in Rzeszow who began arriving at the military base there last month as part of U.S. deterrence efforts against Russia. The president made small talk and shook hands with a group of service members, whom he called the “finest fighting force in the history of the world,” at one point sitting down to join them for a slice of pizza in the mess hall. “You are the organizing principle around which the rest of the world, the free world, is moving,” Biden said. “We’re in the midst of, and I don’t want to sound too philosophic here, but you’re in the midst of a fight between democracies and oligarchs.”

Claims of mass deportations in Ukraine evoke painful history The reports have filtered out for days: Mass kidnappings, forced deportations, Ukrainians spirited across the border to Russia. The Ukrainian foreign ministry said Thursday that 6,000 residents of the besieged city of Mariupol had been “forcibly deported” by Russian forces — stripped of their passports and identity documents — and taken to Russia as “hostages.” Like much in this war, the claims have been impossible to independently verify. A statement from the foreign ministry Thursday echoed allegations and details released by Mariupol’s city council in recent days, stating that “several thousand” of its residents had been taken to “filtration camps” in Russia before being “redirected to remote cities.” Russia, in turn, has cited the “evacuations” of more than 380,000 people from Ukraine to its territory. Communications are sporadic or down, and no foreign journalists are left in the city. That’s meant relying on the rare videos that have emerged from the city — and on the testimony of those who’ve managed to escape. Yet the language — “filtration camps” — and the imagery of mass deportations are particularly resonant, evoking a dark chapter in Russian history. Read the full story here.

Swiss adopt more E.U. sanctions against Russia The Swiss government announced Friday it has decided to adopt more European Union sanctions against Russia over President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Switzerland will now prohibit the export of goods and related services for the Russian energy sector, the government said in a statement. “Also prohibited is the participation in businesses active in the energy sector and the provision of loans or other financial resources to such businesses,” the statement said. The government will also ban iron and steel goods imports from Russia and block the export of luxury goods and maritime navigation goods to the country. In the financial sector, Swiss transactions with certain Russian state-owned firms will be barred.

Polish president’s plane makes emergency landing in Warsaw on way to meet Biden The plane carrying Polish President Andrzej Duda to eastern Poland to meet President Joe Biden made an emergency landing in Warsaw, the Polish state-run news agency PAP reported Friday, citing an adviser to Duda. Duda awaited the departure of a reserve plane to Rzeszow, where he was expected to welcome Biden, according to PAP.

Ukrainian mother of 2 displaced by war: ‘Pray that we win sooner’ Yulia Zhdanova, a Ukrainian mother of two, fled her home in Chernihiv amid Russian bombing. She is now trying to survive in western Ukraine, where she described her new reality in stark terms. The people where she is sheltering “cook food on the fire outside,” Zhdanova said in an interview on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Friday. “They don’t have toilets because there is no water. … They don’t have gas, oil or electricity. No connection.” She said that trucks were bringing water to some regions, but stomach illnesses and other ailments were rampant “because people can’t even wash their hands.” Russian’s attacks on bridges and other critical infrastructure make it especially challenging to access humanitarian aid, she said. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces remain intent on ravaging her country, she said. “They want to destroy everything of what we worshipped, everything [that] was precious to us,” she said. “We don’t want them to do anything on our peaceful land, because before, we had a really good, peaceful life.” But she said she remains optimistic that Ukrainian troops and freedom fighters trying to resist Russia’s assault will be triumphant in the end. “I know that our soldiers are so brave, and they are so patriotic,” she said. “Pray that we win sooner.”

Biden to meet with Ukrainian refugees during Poland visit President Joe Biden will meet with refugees who have fled the war in Ukraine during his time in Poland this weekend, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said. Biden is expected to meet with Polish President Andrzej Duda to discuss the humanitarian response to the conflict. “He will also have the opportunity to meet with Ukrainian refugees, and with American humanitarians who are there trying to help feed and respond to the material needs of the refugee population in Warsaw,” Sullivan said. More than 3.7 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion, according to the United Nations refugee agency. At least 2.2 million have sought refuge in neighboring Poland. Sullivan said Biden would also be giving a major address that will “speak to the stakes of this moment, the urgency of the challenge that lies ahead, what the conflict in Ukraine means for the world, and why it is so important that the free world sustain unity and resolve in the face of Russian aggression.” “He’ll also talk about the context and history of this conflict, and where he sees it going from here,” Sullivan said.

Ukrainian adviser claims attack on ‘nuclear city’ of Slavutych has been repulsed Ukrainian troops fended off a Russian attack on the northern city of Slavutych, which is home to workers from the nearby Chernobyl nuclear plant, a presidential adviser said Friday. Slavutych was built to house Chernobyl workers following the plant’s deadly 1986 nuclear disaster. Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said that a “first attack” Friday on the “city of nuclear weapons” had been repulsed. His statement came just hours after the Slavutych city council warned citizens to stay in their homes, citing the threat of snipers. Officials have been warning for days that Russian troops were close to the city and that it was impossible to evacuate.

Putin says West trying to ‘cancel’ Russian culture President Vladimir Putin on Friday said the West was trying to cancel Russian culture, including the works of great composers such as Pyotr Tchaikovsky, Dmitry Shostakovich and Sergei Rachmaninov. “Today they are trying to cancel a whole thousand-year culture, our people,” Putin said in a televised meeting with cultural figures, referring to the cancellation of events involving Russian masters in some Western countries in recent weeks. “In this way they are banning Russian writers and books,” Putin said.

U.N. rights office says evidence growing of Mariupol mass graves The head of the U.N. human rights team in Ukraine said Friday that monitors had received more information about mass graves in the besieged port city of Mariupol, including one that appeared to hold 200 bodies. “We have got increasing information on mass graves that are there,” Matilda Bogner told journalists by video link from Ukraine, saying some of the evidence came from satellite images. The U.N. rights office, which has some 50 staff in the country, has so far counted 1,035 civilian deaths since Russia invaded Feb. 24. But verification difficulties meant that toll included “very few” from Mariupol, which has been under heavy bombardment for weeks, Bogner said. Bogner’s team is probing alleged human rights violations, such as reports that Russian forces had shot and killed civilians in their cars as they were fleeing; dozens of cases of disappearances of Ukrainian officials and journalists; and the forced movement of civilians into Russian-held territory. Russia, which has called its actions since Feb. 24 a “special operation”, has denied targeting civilians in Ukraine. Bogdan said her team have also received reports of violations by Ukrainian forces including indiscriminate shelling in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine, and two alleged killings of civilians due to their perceived support for Russia. Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly said that they have never targeted civilians, adding that the people who are in Donetsk and Luhansk are Ukrainians.

4 killed after aid center in Kharkiv hit by Russian shelling, local police say Four people were killed after a facility in Kharkiv being used as a humanitarian aid center was hit by shelling Friday morning, Kharkiv police said. “Today at about 7:45 a.m., the Russian Federation fired on a city polyclinic in the Osnoviansky district of the city, where the humanitarian aid center is located. There are no military facilities nearby, ” local police said in a statement. “Police are documenting the crime against the Ukrainian people and gathering all the necessary material evidence to bring the perpetrators to justice,” the statement said.

Ukraine, Russia agree on evacuation corridors from Mariupol and Melitopol Ukraine and Russia have agreed upon two humanitarian corridors for Friday, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in a televised statement. Vereshchuk said that an evacuation corridor was being established from the besieged city of Mariupol, which has been severely bombarded by Russian troops for weeks, to Zaporizhzhia in southeastern Ukraine. Evacuees were expected to arrange their own transport, she said. A centralized plan has also been approved from the port city of Berdyansk to Zaporizhzhia by bus for which 48 buses are already stationed at the entrance to Berdyansk, she said. A second humanitarian corridor links Melitopol to Zaporizhzhia, for which cargoes and buses have already arrived, Vereshchuk said. Russia has previously been accused of failing to uphold its end of agreements to provide safe corridors.

Ukraine asks E.U. to block land and sea transport with Russia and Belarus Ukraine has appealed to the European Union to completely block land and sea transport with Russia and Belarus and to prohibit the movements of goods, its ministry of infrastructure said Friday. In a statement on Facebook, it said that “despite the restrictive measures already in place, Russian businesses are finding workarounds and continuing to operate in other countries.” It proposed that the European Commission prohibit the provision of custom services for goods delivered to the two countries. “These measures are necessary to stop the supply to the aggressor country of dual-use goods that can be used for military purposes,” it said. Earlier, the ministry had called on the E.U. to shut its ports for Russian and Belarusian related companies and demanded closure of the road network for their carriers, it said.

Israel tries to leverage Russia ties to try to end war in Ukraine JERUSALEM — On the surface, it seems like a doomed diplomatic gambit — the untested leader of Israel, which is known for its unresolved conflict with the Palestinians and wars with its neighbors, tries to help end the most serious combat in Europe since the end of World War II. That’s what happened when Prime Minister Naftali Bennett flew to Moscow on Feb. 26, a Saturday, two days after Russia invaded Ukraine, despite being an observant Jew for whom travel on the Sabbath is forbidden unless it’s a matter of life and death. Once there, he met with President Vladimir Putin for three hours in a bid to help end the war. Leaders from other top negotiator countries — NATO members France, Germany and Turkey — have spoken with Putin only by phone, according to Michael Oren, former Israeli ambassador to the United States. Israel, which has failed to negotiate a two-state resolution with the Palestinians, could seem poorly cast as a diplomatic powerhouse in efforts to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The close ally of Washington has also been criticized for not having taken a stronger stance and joining many of its Western allies in sanctioning Russia. Read full story.

Japan increases economic sanctions on Russia Japan will add 25 more Russian officials and oligarchs to its list of blacklisted individuals as part of its economic sanctions on the country, its Foreign Ministry announced on Friday. The ministry said in its regular press livestream that it will freeze the assets of the listed individuals and ban Japanese exports to 81 Russian businesses. “We need to stop this [Russia’s] aggression as soon as possible,” Japan’s foreign minister Hayashi Yoshimasa said in the press conference. Japanese automakers Toyota and Mazda have already suspended imports and halted factory productions in Russia. Prime Minister Kishida also announced an additional 100 million dollars of humanitarian assistance to aid Ukraine and neighboring countries.

Australia imposes sanctions on Belarus president, Russian ‘propagandists’ Australia has placed sanctions on Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko and family, as well as on 22 Russian individuals or “propagandists”, its Foreign Ministry announced on Friday. Foreign minister Marise Payne said in a statement that the Belarusian government has provided “strategic support” to Russia by providing grounds to train military forces, fire missiles, facilitate transportation of Russian troops and heavy weapons into Ukraine “in their assault on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.” The sanctions placed on Russia will continue to target “propagandists and disinformation operatives” including editors from organizations such as Russia Today, the Strategic Culture Foundation, InfoRos and NewsFront. Payne said the move reflected “the strategic importance of disinformation in Russia’s attempts to legitimize Putin’s unprovoked and illegal invasion of Ukraine.”

Biden says Putin using energy resources to ‘coerce’ neighbors as EU commits to transatlantic data flows President Joe Biden, in a joint statement with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, said Putin has used Russia’s energy resources to “coerce” its neighbors, as the two leaders announced measures to reduce Europe’s dependency on Russian fuel. “I know that eliminating Russian gas will have costs for Europe. But it’s not only the right thing to do from a moral standpoint, it’s going to put us on a much stronger strategic footing,” he said in Brussels on Friday, as they announced the establishment of a task force. Von der Leyen also revealed a new framework for transatlantic data flow, enabling “predictable and trustworthy data flows between the EU and U.S.,” which Biden said will help “companies both small and large compete in the digital economy.”

Mariupol officials: About 300 dead in theater attack, according to eyewitnesses Around 300 people died after Russian forces bombed a theater where over 1,000 people had taken refuge in the besieged city of Mariupol, local officials said Friday, citing eyewitnesses. NBC News was not able to independently the claim, which involved an attack on March 16 that has become an emblem of Russia’s indiscriminate bombardment of civilian targets. Mariupol’s city council said that “about 300 people” died in the attack on the theater, according to eyewitnesses, calling it a “horror.” The council said that it had wanted to “believe” that those inside the theater had all managed to escape, but that testimonies from those who’d been inside the building “say otherwise.” “The Drama Theater in the heart of Mariupol has always been the hallmark of the city,” the council said in a statement. “Now there is no more Drama theatre. In its place, a new point of pain for Mariupol residents appeared, ruins that became the last refuge for hundreds of innocent people.” Russia has denied targeting civilians in its attacks on Ukraine.

U.S., E.U. announce Task Force to reduce Europe’s dependence on Russian energy The United States and European Union have announced a joint task force to reduce Europe’s dependence on Russian fuels, strengthening the region’s energy security as Russia continues its invasion in Ukraine. “This Task Force for Energy Security will be chaired by a representative from the White House and a representative of the President of the European Commission,” said the White House on Friday. The Task Force will focus its efforts on diversifying liquefied natural gas, reducing demand for natural gas altogether and accelerating renewable energy projects, it said.

Russia and Ukraine swap prisoners of war Russia and Ukraine have carried out their first “full-fledged” prisoner swap since the war began, according to Ukraine’s deputy prime minister. Iryna Vereshchuk said in a Telegram post that 10 Russian prisoners of war were handed over in exchange for 10 Ukrainian servicemen. An additional 11 Russian civilian sailors rescued from a sunken ship were being exchanged for 19 Ukrainian sailors who hailed from the Sapphire rescue ship, she added. The Sapphire’s crew was captured in late February when the vessel was trying to get troops off of Snake Island. Vereshchuk did not say when or where the exchange took place in her Thursday post. Russia’s human rights commissioner, Tatyana Moskalkova, confirmed the swap, according to the Interfax News Agency. “We, too, were involved in establishing contact with Ukraine on this issue. Work continues in the framework of the queries I receive from citizens,” Moskalkova told Interfax.

Mariupol police general offers his life to save children Mariupol National Police General Vyacheslav Abroskin has offered his life to Russian forces, asking to let children out of the besieged port city in exchange. “There are many children left who, if not saved now, will die in the coming days, the clock is ticking,” he said in a Facebook statement on Wednesday. “My life belongs to me alone and I offer it in exchange for the lives of children who still remain in Mariupol,” he said. Abroskin, who said he was on Russia’s “wanted list,” appealed to the forces to let him organize the removal of children, asking for three days.

Ukraine reclaims ground, pushes Russians away from Kyiv, U.K. says Ukrainian forces have reclaimed towns and continue to push Russian Forces away from the Kyiv towards Hostomel Airfield in the north-west, Britain’s defense ministry has said. In an intelligence update published Friday, it said, “Ukrainian counter-attacks, and Russian Forces falling back on overextended supply lines, has allowed Ukraine to re-occupy towns and defensive positions” up to just over 20 miles east of Kyiv. In the south, Russian forces continued to circumvent Mykolaiv to reach east towards Odesa, it said.

Biden heads to Poland as country grapples with Ukraine refugee influx President Joe Biden on Friday plans to travel to southeastern Poland, where he intends to meet with U.S. troops and aid workers assisting refugees in a country on the front lines of the humanitarian and military crisis unfolding in Ukraine. Biden is scheduled to visit Rzeszow to thank the thousands of U.S. troops who began arriving at a military base there last month. The base in Poland is less than 100 miles from where Russian missiles struck a Ukrainian military post this month. Before he returns to Washington on Saturday, Biden said, he will try to meet with some of the refugees. “I’ve been to refugee camps, I’ve been in war zones for the last 15 years, and it’s devastating,” Biden said at a news conference Thursday. He said meeting with refugees in Poland would “reinforce my commitment to have the United States make sure we are a major piece of dealing with the relocation of all those folks.” Read the full story here.",https://mediianews.com/2022/03/25/biden-speaks-to-troops-in-poland-where-millions-have-sought-refuge/

US President Joe Biden unloaded on Russia’s Vladimir Putin in a speech in Poland in one of his most passionate speeches. Here is an edited transcript of what he said:

“Thank you, thank you, thank you. Please, if you have a seat, be seated. (Laughter) If you don’t, come up on stage.

“Be not afraid.” They were the first words at the first public address of the first Polish Pope after his election on October of 1978. They were words that would come to define Pope John Paul II. Words that would change the world.

John Paul brought the message here to Warsaw in his first trip back home as Pope in June of 1979. It was a message about the power – the power of faith, the power of resilience, and the power of the people.

In the face of a cruel and brutal system of government, it was a message that helped end the Soviet repression in the Central land and Eastern Europe 30 years ago. It was a message that will overcome the cruelty and brutality of this unjust war.

When Pope John Paul brought that message in 1979, the Soviet Union ruled with an iron fist behind an Iron Curtain.

Then a year later, the Solidarity movement took hold in Poland. And while I know he couldn’t be here tonight, we’re all grateful in America and around the world for Lech Wałęsa. (Applause.)

It reminds me of that phrase of philosopher Kierkegaard: ”faith sees best in the dark.” And there were dark moments.

In this battle, we need to be clear-eyed. This battle will not be won in days or months either. We need to steel ourselves for the long fight ahead.

Today, Russia has strangled democracy – has sought to do so elsewhere, not only in its homeland. Under false claims of ethnic solidarity, it has invalidated neighbouring nations.

It’s a lie, it’s just cynical

Putin has the gall to say he’s “de-Nazifying” Ukraine. It’s a lie. It’s just cynical. He knows that. And it’s also obscene.

President Zelensky was democratically elected. He’s Jewish. His father’s family was wiped out in the Nazi Holocaust. And Putin has the audacity, like all autocrats before him, to believe that might will make right.

Time and again, we offered real diplomacy and concrete proposals to strengthen European security, enhance transparency, and build confidence on all sides.

But Putin and Russia met each of the proposals with disinterest in any negotiation, with lies and ultimatums. Russia was bent on violence from the start.

I know not all of you believed me and us when we kept saying, “They are going to cross the border. They are going to attack.”

Repeatedly, he asserted, “We have no interest in war.” Guaranteed he would not move.

Repeatedly saying he would not invade Ukraine.

Repeatedly saying Russian troops along the border were there for “training” – all 180,000 of them.

There is simply no justification or provocation for Russia’s choice of war. It’s an example of one of the oldest of human impulses: using brute force and disinformation to satisfy a craving for absolute power and control.

Swift and punishing costs are the only things that are going to get Russia to change its course.

Rouble reduced to rubble

As a result of these unprecedented sanctions, the rouble almost is immediately reduced to rubble. The Russian economy (applause) that’s true, by the way. It takes about 200 rubles to equal one dollar.

The economy is on track to be cut in half in the coming years. It was ranked -- Russia’s economy was ranked the 11th biggest economy in the world before this invasion. It will soon not even rank among the top 20 in the world. (Applause.)

Taken together, these economic sanctions are a new kind of economic statecraft with the power to inflict damage that rivals military might.

These international sanctions are sapping Russian strength, its ability to replenish its military, and its ability – its ability to project power. And it is Putin – it is Vladimir Putin who is to blame, period.

And thanks to the courage and bravery of the Ukrainian people (applause) the equipment we’ve sent and our colleagues have sent have been used to devastating effect to defend Ukrainian land and airspace. Our Allies and partners have stepped up as well.

We have a sacred obligation – (applause) – we have a sacred obligation under Article 5 to defend each and every inch of NATO territory with the full force of our collective power.

And earlier today, I visited your National Stadium, where thousands of Ukrainian refugees are now trying to answer the toughest questions a human can ask: “My God, what’s going to happen to me? What’s going to happen to my family?

‘Is my brother and my daddy – are they going to be okay?’

I saw tears in many of the mothers’ eyes as I embraced them; their young children – their young children not sure whether to smile or cry. One little girl said, “Mr President” -- she spoke a little English -- “is my brother and my daddy -- are they going to be okay? Will I see them again?” Without their husbands, their fathers, in many cases, their brothers or sisters who stayed back to fight for their country.

I didn’t have to speak the language or understand the language to feel the emotion in their eyes, the way they gripped my hand, and little kids hung on to my leg, praying with a desperate hope that all this is temporary; apprehension that they may be perhaps forever away from their homes, almost with debilitating sadness that this is happening all over again.

But I was also struck by the generosity of the people of Warsaw -- for that matter, all the Polish people -- for the depths of their compassion, their willingness to reach out – (applause) – opening their hearts.

Notwithstanding the brutality of Vladimir Putin, let there be no doubt that this war has already been a strategic failure for Russia already. (Applause.) Having lost children myself -- I know that’s no solace to the people who’ve lost family.

But he, Putin, thought Ukrainians would roll over and not fight. Not much of a student of history. Instead, Russian forces have met their match with brave and stiff Ukrainian resistance.

Rather than breaking Ukrainian resolve, Russia’s brutal tactics have strengthened the resolve. (Applause.)

Rather than driving NATO apart, the West is now stronger and more united than it has ever been. (Applause.)

Democracies revitalised

Russia wanted less of a NATO presence on its border, but now he has [we have] a stronger presence, a larger presence, with over a hundred thousand American troops here, along with all the other members of NATO.

In fact – (applause) – Russia has managed to cause something I’m sure he never intended: The democracies of the world are revitalised with purpose and unity found in months that we’d once taken years to accomplish.

It’s not only Russia’s actions in Ukraine that are reminding us of democracy’s blessing. It’s our own country – his own country, the Kremlin, is jailing protestors. Two hundred thousand people have allegedly already left. There’s a brain drain – leaving Russia. Shutting down independent news. State media is all propaganda, blocking the image of civilian targets, mass graves, starvation tactics of the Russian forces in Ukraine.

Is it any wonder, as I said, that 200,000 Russians have all left their country in one month? A remarkable brain drain in such a short period of time, which brings me to my message to the Russian people:

I’ve worked with Russian leaders for decades. I sat across the negotiating table going all the way back to Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin to talk arms control at the height of the Cold War.

I’ve always spoken directly and honestly to you, the Russian people.

The Russian people are not our enemy

Let me say this, if you’re able to listen: You, the Russian people, are not our enemy.

I refuse to believe that you welcome the killing of innocent children and grandparents or that you accept hospitals, schools, maternity wards that, for God’s sake, are being pummeled with Russian missiles and bombs; or cities being surrounded so that civilians cannot flee; supplies cut off and attempting to starve Ukrainians into submission.

Millions of families are being driven from their homes, including half of all Ukraine’s children. These are not the actions of a great nation.

Now, Vladimir Putin’s aggression has cut you, the Russian people, off from the rest of the world, and it’s taking Russia back to the 19th century.

This is not who you are. This is not the future reserve – you deserve for your families and your children. I’m telling you the truth: This war is not worthy of you, the Russian people.

Putin can and must end this war. The American people stand with you and the brave citizens of Ukraine who want peace.

It’s not enough to speak with rhetorical flourish, of ennobling words of democracy, of freedom, equality, and liberty. All of us, including here in Poland, must do the hard work of democracy each and every day. My country as well.

That’s why – (applause) – that’s why I came to Europe again this week with a clear and determined message for NATO, for the G7, for the European Union, for all freedom-loving nations: We must commit now to be in this fight for the long haul. We must remain unified today and tomorrow and the day after and for the years and decades to come. (Applause.)

For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power

It will not be easy. There will be costs. But it’s a price we have to pay. Because the darkness that drives autocracy is ultimately no match for the flame of liberty that lights the souls of free people everywhere.

Time and again, history shows that it’s from the darkest moments that the greatest progress follows. And history shows this is the task of our time, the task of this generation.

Let’s remember: The hammer blow that brought down the Berlin Wall, the might that lifted the Iron Curtain were not the words of a single leader; it was the people of Europe who, for decades, fought to free themselves.

Their sheer bravery opened the border between Austria and Hungary for the Pan-European Picnic. They joined hands for the Baltic Way. They stood for Solidarity here in Poland. And together, it was an unmistakable and undeniable force of the people that the Soviet Union could not withstand.

And we’re seeing it once again today with the brave Ukrainian people, showing that their power of many is greater than the will of any one dictator. (Applause.)

So, in this hour, let the words of Pope John Paul burn as brightly today: “Never, ever give up hope, never doubt, never tire, never become discouraged. Be not afraid.” (Applause.)

A dictator bent on rebuilding an empire will never erase a people’s love for liberty. Brutality will never grind down their will to be free. Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia -- for free people refuse to live in a world of hopelessness and darkness.

We will have a different future – a brighter future rooted in democracy and principle, hope and light, of decency and dignity, of freedom and possibilities.

For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power.

God bless you all. And may God defend our freedom. (Applause.) And may God protect our troops. Thank you for your patience. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you.",https://www.afr.com/world/europe/this-man-cannot-remain-in-power-biden-on-putin-20220327-p5a89j
