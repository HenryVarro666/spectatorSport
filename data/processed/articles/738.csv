Australia's government is banning the export of alumina and aluminum ores to Russia, as it moves to drive up the economic costs for the Kremlin over the decision to invade Ukraine.

Australian officials said the restrictions, which include a ban on bauxite, is designed to curtail Russia's ability to produce aluminum, which it in turn exports to buyers across a range of industries, including automotive and construction. It is also a vital ingredient in arms and munition manufacturing.

""[I]t's a critical input into weaponry, including guns, ammunition and missiles. Our decision here should say very clearly that to all countries, all companies operating in Australia, we are watching these things very, very carefully,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a press conference.

He added that the ban demonstrated Australia's ""absolute commitment to holding the Putin regime to account.""

According to the government, aluminum is a critical export for Russia, which relies on Australia for 20% of its alumina needs.

Morrison said a ship was due to arrive in Australia from Russia this week to pick up a shipment of alumina, a key component in aluminum smelting. ""That boat is not going to Russia with our alumina.""

Australia also said it would provide additional support to help Ukraine's government beat back the Russian invasion and care for those impacted by the violence.

Australia has banned the sale of alumina and aluminium ores to Russia in response to what it described as “unrelenting and illegal aggression” towards Ukraine, reports Christopher Knaus.

Also on Sunday, prime minister Scott Morrison announced Australia would donate coal and further military equipment to Ukraine to “support the brave and courageous resistance” as part of a new aid package that also includes $30m in emergency humanitarian assistance.

“Russia must pay a very high price for its brutality. It must pay that price economically, it must pay the price ... in diplomatic terms as well,” Morrison said.

It came as foreign minister Marise Payne described Russia’s atrocities in Ukraine as “war crimes” and said “innocent civilians and civilian infrastructure” were being targeted.

The federal government has been under pressure to stop the export of alumina to Russia, with critics warning it was potentially allowing Australian resources to be used in munitions manufacturing.

The government overnight announced it was ceasing all exports of alumina and aluminum ores, including bauxite, to limit Russia’s ability to produce aluminium, a major Russian export and a critical component in arms and munitions.

Russia relies on Australia for 20% of its alumina needs.

The government said it would work with “exporters and peak bodies that will be affected by the ban to find new [markets] and expand existing markets”.

The sanctions are likely to impact Queensland Alumina Ltd (QAL), majority owned by Rio Tinto in a joint venture with Russia’s Rusal International, the second biggest aluminium producer in the world.

QAL was affected by sanctions announced last week, which targeted two Russian businessmen, Viktor Vekselberg and Oleg Deripaska.

A company founded by Deripaska owns 20% of the QAL, which is a major employer in Gladstone.

After the sanctions on Deripaska, the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, an advocacy organisation, called for a complete ban on Rusal exporting Australian alumina to Russia.

On Sunday, the centre’s climate and environment director, Dan Gocher, said the ban addressed the concern over Australian alumina being used in Russian arms manufacturing.

“The secondary concern is that Deripaska and Vekselberg still stand to profit from Queensland Alumina,” he said. “If the government doesn’t sanction Rusal, then Rio Tinto must ensure any profits are quarantined.”

Rusal said in a statement that Deripaska had surrendered his majoirty interest and control over Rusal and its parent company, En+, after an agreement with the US Treasury following sanctions in 2019.

“Pursuant to the agreement with the US Treasury, which removed Mr Deripaska from control of the business, and which remains effective and ongoing, Mr Deripaska cannot receive any type of financial benefit from his minority holding in EN+, RUSAL or any part of the Group and is completely blocked from receiving dividends.”

Rusal said Vekselberg was indirectly a minority beneficiary and has no influence on the company’s operations.

A spokesman for Rio Tinto said the company had already announced it was in the process of terminating all commercial relationships with any Russian business.

“Our priority remains the wellbeing of our people, our communities and the continued safe operation of our businesses, in full compliance with all governmental directions, including the Queensland Alumina Limited joint venture.”

The Australian government also announced a new major aid and assistance package to Ukraine. The package included a donation of 70,000 tonnes of thermal coal to assist Ukraine with energy security.

The coal will be sourced from Whitehaven Coal, which has arranged the shipment. Australia is working with Ukraine and Poland to deliver the supplies.

“The assistance will help keep the country’s coal-fired power generators operating and supplying electricity to the country’s power grid, supporting the Ukrainian people by keeping lights on, homes heated and factories running at this very difficult time,” the government said in a statement.

The aid package also includes $30m in additional emergency humanitarian assistance and a new humanitarian visa, which will be temporarily available to Ukrainians fleeing the war. The visa allows work, study and access to Medicare for three years.

“Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began, the Morrison government has issued almost 4,500 visas to Ukrainians,” the government said. “Over 600 Ukrainians with these visas have arrived and more are coming every day.”

Donations to approved charities and not-for-profits supporting Ukrainian refugees will be made tax deductible and Australia will give $10m to the World Food Program to help address food shortages.

The measures were welcomed by the Australian Council for International Development, a peak group for the aid sector, who described the intervention as “critical for the Ukrainian people in their hour of need”.

“This new funding will protect women, children, people with disabilities and the elderly as they flee the violence and destruction,” chief executive Marc Purcell said.

Australia has also boosted its military assistance to Ukraine by $21m, taking the total military funding to $91m. The new assistance will include “additional material from Australian Defence Force stocks”.",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/20/australia-bans-exports-of-aluminium-ores-to-russia-over-aggression-towards-ukraine
4,c6cd2462-d1bc-46e3-aa01-6cd7ad8fd2fa,['Online News Editor'],,"Sydney, Australia, Mar 20 (EFE).- Australia Sunday announced an immediate ban on the exports of alumina and aluminum ores, including bauxite, to Russia as part of punitive actions on Moscow for “its unrelenting and illegal aggression against Ukraine.”

Prime Minister Scott Morrison promised more military equipment, 70,000 tonnes of thermal coal, and “an additional $30 million in emergency humanitarian assistance” to the war-ravaged Ukraine that “is showing remarkable courage and resilience as it endures Russia’s unprovoked war.”

The prime minister, in a statement, said the export ban would limit the Russian capacity to produce aluminum – a critical export for Russia.

Russia relies on Australia for nearly 20 percent of its alumina needs.

“Russia is targeting civilians, causing immense suffering…Australia will continue to impose high costs on Russia,” said Morrison.

The export ban follows sanctions on 443 individuals, including many oligarchs close to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

These include oligarch Oleg Deripaska, president of the Russian aluminum company Rusal, which has a 20 percent stake in the Queensland Alumina refinery in Gladstone.

Last week, the Anglo-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto, the majority partner of the refinery, said it would cut all commercial ties with Russian companies.

Australia has also sanctioned 33 entities, including most of Russia’s banking sector and those responsible for Russia’s sovereign debt.

Morrison said his government would donate at least 70,000 tonnes of thermal coal to support Ukraine’s energy security after a request from Kyiv.

“(The) government commits to an additional AU$30 million ($22.3 million) in emergency humanitarian assistance. (It) will focus on protecting women, children, the elderly, and the disabled, and takes the total we have so far committed to $65 million,” the statement said.

Morrison said it was clear that Ukraine’s need for military assistance remained urgent and ongoing.

He said his government had “developed an additional $21 million support package of defensive military assistance for Ukrainian Armed Forces, bringing Australia’s total military aid to $91 million.

“The government will continue to identify opportunities to provide further military assistance where it is able to provide required capability to the Ukraine Armed Forces expeditiously.” EFE

The city has been a site of intense fighting in recent weeks. (Alexey Kudenko/Sputnik/AP)

The south eastern city of Mariupol has been under siege for several weeks, with residents facing a constant barrage of deadly unprovoked Russian attacks. These have included deadly strikes on a maternity ward and the bombing of a theater, the losses from which are still unknown as the rescue operation continues.

Here's what we know about the situation in the besieged city:

Taken against their will: Residents of Mariupol are being taken to Russia against their will by Russian forces, the Mariupol City Council said Saturday. Captured Mariupol residents were forcibly taken to camps where Russian forces checked their phones and documents, then redirected some of the residents to remote cities in Russia, the council said.

Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko compared Russia's actions to ""horrific events of World War II, when the Nazis forcibly captured people.""

Constant bombardment: A Ukrainian army commander told CNN people in Mariupol risk their lives each time they emerge from underground bunkers, and claimed the strategic port is facing the most intense fighting anywhere in the country. Major Denis Prokopenko, from the National Guard Azov Regiment, said air and land attacks on the city were now almost relentless.

Bodies in the street: Prokopenko said people in the city were reluctant to leave their underground shelters even to get hold of essentials, meaning they were trying to drink less water and eat less food, only emerging to prepare hot meals. Basic services like gas, electricity and water, are all out in the city. Bodies are being left in the street because there is either no one left to collect them, or it is simply too dangerous to try.

Theater attack: A new satellite image shows the Mariupol theater, which was bombed several days ago, almost completely destroyed, with just the western façade still standing. Still clearly visible in the photo is the Russian word for ""children"" painted by sheltering residents in large letters on the ground in front of the entrance. Hundreds of Ukrainians, including many children, were taking shelter inside the theater when it was attacked. Communications in the besieged city have been difficult for days and rescue work has been hampered by the danger of near-continuous shelling, according to reports from inside the city.

Zelensky: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the sustained Russian attack on Mariupol is an ""act of terror"" that will be ""remembered for centuries."" In a video message posted to Facebook early Sunday, the Ukrainian President said Mariupol will go down in history as an example of war crimes.

Steel plant: There are conflicting reports over the status of one of Ukraine’s key industrial facilities – the Azov Steel plant in Mariupol. Late Friday, a government advisor reported the plant was in Russian hands after ongoing battles with Ukrainian troops. But in an update Saturday, the Azov battalion, which has a large presence in Mariupol, said the plant remained in their hands.

6,c6cd2462-d1bc-46e3-aa01-6cd7ad8fd2fa,[],,"SHANGHAI, Mar 21 (SMM) - According to foreign media reports, Australia’s Prime Minister Morrison announced an immediate ban on the export of alumina and aluminum ore, including bauxite, to Russia, on March 20, as additional sanctions against Moscow. Aluminium is one of Russia's important exports. ""Russia relies on Australia for nearly 20% of its alumina demand and the ban will limit Russia's ability to produce aluminium,"" Morrison said in a statement. In addition, the Australian government announced it would donate more military equipment, humanitarian aid and coal to Ukraine to fend off the invasion, while imposing additional sanctions on Russia.

From the perspective of Rusal's alumina supply:

Russia is the largest producer of aluminum other than China. In 2021, Russia's aluminum production reached 3.76 million mt, accounting for more than 5% of global production. In order to match such high aluminum output, Rusal has an alumina capacity of about 9.5 million mt/year. In 2021, Rusal’s alumina output was 8.3 million mt, accounting for 6.3% of global alumina production. The distribution of Rusal’s alumina refineries shows that about 66% of them are outside Russia and located in Ireland, Jamaica, Ukraine, Guinea and Australia. Rusal’s installed alumina capacity in Russia totals 3 million mt. Its Ewarton refinery in Jamaica has an installed capacity of 675,000 mt, Aughinish refinery in Ireland has an installed capacity of 2 million mt, Nikolaev refinery in Ukraine has an installed capacity of 1.77 million mt, and Friguia refinery in Guinea has an installed capacity of 675,000 mt, and its refinery in Australia has an installed capacity of about 1.5 million mt. At present, Nikolaev refinery in Ukraine has stopped production. Given the sanctions imposed by Australia, Rusal’s 1.5 million mt/year alumina refinery in Australia will also face the risk of cutting production. If Rusal wants to guarantee its production of aluminum, it has to seek alumina from other regions.

Rusal's bauxite supply:

Rusal has three bauxite projects in Guinea, with a combined output of 7.5 million mt of bauxite in 2021, accounting for 50% of Rusal's total bauxite production. Among them, the Dian-Dian mine mainly supplies bauxite to the Aughinish alumina refinery in Ireland, the Friguia mine mainly supplies to the local Friguia alumina refinery, and the Kindia mine mainly supplies to the Nikolaev alumina refinery in Ukraine. Due to closure of Nikolaev refinery, Rusal has been shipping bauxite that was originally bound for Ukraine to its Aughinish refinery in Ireland recently. On the whole, Rusal has enough bauxite for its own use, but it is necessary to pay attention to the impact of the current turmoil on sea freight and shipping capacity.

The current focus is still on the supply of alumina in Russia

Based on the installed aluminum capacity in Russia, Rusal still needs additional 4 million mt of alumina. The closure of the 1.77 million mt/year Nikolaev refinery in Ukraine has made things even worse for Rusal. In order to ensure the stable operation of high-profit aluminum, Rusal may seek alumina from neighbouring countries. China may become Rusal's best alumina supplier in terms of its advantageous geographical location and huge installed capacity.

On the whole, the overseas alumina market tends to shift from a tight balance to a supply deficit.

As of March 20, alumina prices have soared to $535/mt FOB Western Australia, and the price difference between China and overseas has gradually expanded to 1,450 yuan/mt. As a big alumina producer, China may be able to fill in supply gap of Rusal or even overseas market. If China’s alumina exports grow significantly, domestic alumina prices will find solid support.",https://news.metal.com/newscontent/101782298/smm-analysis-on-impact-of-australia%E2%80%99s-immediate-ban-on-alumina-and-bauxite-exports-to-russia
