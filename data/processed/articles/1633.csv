Russia, Ukraine trade naval mines accusations

Russia and Ukraine have traded accusations about the naval mines that have been set adrift in the Black Sea, threatening shipping.

The Russian military alleged that the Ukrainian military has used old naval mines to protect the coast against a Russian landing and some of them have been ripped off their anchors by a storm and left adrift.

Russian Colonel General Mikhail Mizintsev reaffirmed that ""the threat of Ukrainian mines drifting along the coastline of Black Sea states remains"" and the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry responded in a statement, accusing Russia of using Ukrainian mines it seized after the 2014 annexation of Ukraine's the Crimean Peninsula and setting them adrift to ""discredit Ukraine before international partners.""

Ukraine leader sees 'positive' signals from talks with Russia

""Let's just see what they have to offer.""

Russia says de-escalation not a ceasefire

Russia's promise to scale down military operations around Kiev and northern Ukraine does not represent a ceasefire and talks on a formal agreement with Kiev have a long way to go, Moscow's lead negotiator in peace talks has said.

Russian negotiators gave an undertaking to sharply scale back military activity around Ukraine's capital Kiev and the northern city of Chernihiv, in the most tangible sign yet of progress towards a peace deal.

""This is not a ceasefire but this is our aspiration, gradually to reach a de-escalation of the conflict at least on these fronts,"" Vladimir Medinsky, head of the Russian team, said in an interview with the TASS news agency.
