Today, April 2, Russia's military attack on Ukraine has been going on for thirty-eight days. We're reporting on all the current news. The article will be constantly updated.

What about today?

Key points

The armed forces of the Russian Federation continue their armed aggression against Ukraine.

They are withdrawing troops in certain areas, probably in order to strengthen the grouping of the occupying forces for further offensive operations in the Sloboda, Donetsk, and Luhansk areas.

However, these areas have been hotspots every day. A group of troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine repulsed 9 enemy attacks in the Donetsk and Luhansk directions in the past 24 hours. Our soldiers destroyed 8 tanks, 44 armored fighting vehicles, 16 units of vehicles, and 10 artillery systems.

Over the past week, the irreparable loss of personnel in the units of the so-called 2nd Army Corps amounted to about 800 people.

Our soldiers are fighting heroically for every meter of our land, the enemy's strength and motivation are exhausted, but Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Oleksii Danilov urged Ukrainians not to fall into euphoria from the fact that Russian troops are retreating in certain directions (""our fighters' lives and Ukrainian Armed Forces' work is behind every withdrawal""). He says that the Russian army is being reformatted to launch new strikes. Danilov believes that Putin will try to win anywhere by May 9 to ""hold a victory parade."" The Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council warned that there are still many fights ahead and that ""I don't advise anyone to relax.""

President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola, who arrived in Kyiv. ""I came to Ukraine not only to confirm our solidarity. I would also like to make sure that you have everything you need to win this war. Because if you win, the whole world will win,"" said Roberta Metsola.

Russia is a country without shame, morality, and humanity. Since the beginning of the war, the occupiers have fired on 274 hospitals and shut down 70 ambulances. 154 residential buildings, 20 private estates, 27 kindergartens, and 44 schools were damaged.

Zelenskyy completely excludes renouncing the territory for the sake of a peace agreement, he said in an interview with Fox News.

Ukraine's talks with Russia

Davyd Arakhamia, the head of the Ukrainian delegation to the talks, announced some important news from the talks on the telethon:

Russia has verbally accepted a project proposed by Ukraine in Istanbul , with the exception of Crimea (Kyiv is proposing to open 15-year talks on it, and Moscow is demanding recognition of its Russian status).

, with the exception of Crimea (Kyiv is proposing to open 15-year talks on it, and Moscow is demanding recognition of its Russian status). Kyiv is waiting for Russia to confirm its statements at the talks in writing.

Negotiations are underway with China through diplomatic channels to make it a guarantor of Ukraine. But, according to Arakhamia, the issue with China has been worked out less than with other countries.

We will not sign any document where Russia will have the right to veto the decision with its vote, added Arakhamia.

He also said that ""we want to make our own NATO.""

Trophies of the Armed Forces

Resistance forces in Shestovytsia, Chernihiv region, replenished armored personnel carriers for the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

The Armed Forces of Ukraine has successfully used Starstreak, a missile that strikes targets with three kinetic darts. Thus, a Russian helicopter was shot down in the Luhansk region.

During the fighting in the Kyiv direction, one of the units of the National Guard of Ukraine acquired trophy Russian equipment SAU 2C -3 and MT-LB. Ukrainian defenders have already towed them to the rear. After minor repairs, the equipment will strengthen the unit fighting in this direction.

And in this photo, soldiers of the Special Operations Forces Resistance Movement are inspecting a Russian helicopter shot down by soldiers of the Defense Forces of Ukraine.

Humanitarian corridors

Today, Saturday, April 2, 2022, 7 evacuation routes have been agreed upon:

Donetsk region: Private transport: Mariupol – Manhush – Berdiansk – Tokmak – Vasylivka – Kamianske – Zaporizhzhia

Zaporizhzhia region: Berdiansk – Tokmak – Vasylivka – Kamianske – Zaporizhzhia

Evacuation buses and humanitarian aid are at the entrance to Berdiansk. In the morning, 10 additional evacuation buses left Zaporizhzhia for Berdiansk.

Luhansk region:

– Nyzhne – Hirske – Lysychansk – Bakhmut

– Severodonetsk – Lysychansk – Bakhmut

Humanitarian cargo and evacuation buses will be sent from Bakhmut.

22:00 – Today, 4,217 people were evacuated from Donetsk, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia regions on April 2, said the head of the Ministry of Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories Iryna Vereshchuk.

Atomic and chemical threats

Russia will not attack nuclear facilities in Ukraine. The head of the IAEA Rafael Grossi is sure of it. The International Atomic Energy Agency will start assisting Ukraine in maintaining the safety of nuclear facilities. Regarding reports of exposure of the Russian military to the Chornobyl nuclear power plant, Grossi said the agency had contacted its Russian counterparts for more information.

Most likely, in the near future, Russia may decide to conduct a chemical attack on Ukraine. Therefore, Ukraine should be prepared for such a scenario. This is the opinion of Oleksii Danilov, Head of the Council of Experts on Energy Security. ""You know that, despite the ban on all international institutions on the use of chemical weapons, they used it in Syria at one time. We have a clear awareness that they can do it in our country. We must be ready for that,"" he said.

Who's coming to Ukraine?

About financial aid, weapons, and volunteer fighters

The United States will provide Ukraine with equipment to protect against possible chemical attacks, the White House said. ""In an effort to help our Ukrainian partners, the US government is providing the Ukrainian government with rescue tools and materials that could be deployed in the event of Russia's use of chemical or biological weapons,"" said White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki.

News from partners

American actor Sean Penn appealed to billionaires around the world to help Ukraine. Penn is asking billionaires to spend $300 million and buy two squadrons of F-15 or F-16 fighters for Ukraine, which would have a qualitative advantage over Russian Su and MiG fighters. He also called for $200 million worth of missile defense systems for Ukraine, for a total of half a billion dollars.

US President Biden said more than 30 countries had decided to release oil from their reserves to lower prices. He added that various states have united to prevent Russia from ""turning energy resources into weapons"" against the United States, Europe, and other countries.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Bulgaria has declared the first secretary of the Russian embassy in Sofia persona non grata. He is suspected of espionage. A Russian diplomat has 72 hours to leave Bulgaria.

Following Bulgaria, the German government is considering expelling ""a significant number"" of Russian diplomats suspected of espionage.

The Pope has already abandoned Moscow's terminology, calling a ""special military operation"" a war. Today, he condemned ""unjustified aggression"" by Russia and ""atrocities"" in the war. ""Again, a dictator, unfortunately, entangled in anachronistic statements about nationalist interests, provokes and inflames conflicts, while ordinary people feel the need to build a future that will either be common or non-existent,"" Francis told Maltese officials.

What's in Russia?

In Ukraine, the Russian military will be paid for voluntarily transferring usable military equipment to the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The Verkhovna Rada voted in favor of the document. The Russian military is guaranteed the right to keep secret the fact of transferring equipment, obtaining new documents with new installation data and security of their stay in Ukraine, as well as creating conditions for travel to a safe third country. Very good offer!

On April 1 this year, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation decided to hold a military meeting with reservists from April 4 to May 23, 2022. The redeployment of Russian troops and units of the so-called Transnistrian-Moldavian Republic in order to prepare for a demonstration of readiness for the offensive and, possibly, hostilities against Ukraine was also noted.

There are many forbidden words and expressions in Putin's Russia. They even arrest people for the inscription on the sausage package:

""In unrecognized Transnistria, rumors are spreading about the coercion of army personnel to take part in the war against Ukraine,"" the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said.

Panic is also spreading among Russian servicemen because of radiation exposure of personnel based in the Chornobyl zone. The population of Bragin, Belarus, is advised to avoid contact with the Russian occupiers who have left the contaminated area.

What about Belarus?

About 25 missiles were launched from Belarus to Ukraine last night alone. This was reported by the media and Belarusian telegram channels.

Russian lies

On March 15, Solovyov stated in his telegram channel to all of Russia that the legendary Canadian sniper Vali, who was fighting on the side of Ukraine, had allegedly been killed by Russian special forces. As a real sniper, Vali showed endurance, and two weeks later showed a photo greeting to Solovyov and all those who rejoiced at his ""death."" He posted a photo with a Russian C-ration of racists.

In Russia, a video is being distributed where an Azovstal employee allegedly wants to join the occupiers' armed forces. This was reported in the Mariupol City Council: ""They took an actor, invented his name and position and called him an Azov resident. It is said that an employee of the plant allegedly wants to join the ranks of murderers."" Azovstal HR has raised the base of all employees of all Metinvest Group companies over the years. As it turned out, a person with this name and surname had never worked at the company.

Sanctions on the aggressor!

Ritter Sport has started to have problems selling products in Europe. Earlier, the company refused to leave Russia and even stated that it would develop its business there. Buyers did not like it very much, but the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany Andrii Melnyk added a special reputation, inventing a new slogan for Ritter Sport: ""Quadratisch, praktisch, Blut"" (Square, practical, bloody). The slogan has literally spread on the Internet and is already threatening to collapse sales across Europe. Now it's not about sanctions, it's about principles.

Oil giant Shell will not be able to pay for gas delivery under the new Kremlin scheme, as the UK has put Gazprombank under sanctions.

But Moldova has decided to ""maintain neutrality"" and will not join the sanctions imposed on Russia, President Maia Sandu told Radio Europa Liberă. This is a decision of a small country, which allegedly does not affect anything and does not want to irritate a large country. Unfortunately, this does not work with Russia. It always wants blood.

Russian gas is no longer supplied to the Baltic States, said Uldis Bariss, chairman of the board of the natural gas system operator Conexus Baltic Grid.

The supply of champagne from France to Russia was stopped after the start of the Russian military operation in Ukraine. The prospects are unknown, said the director-general of the Union of French Champagne Houses (UMC) David Chatillon. But we believe there are no secrets here. Hawthorn tincture instead of champagne is the prospect in Russia.

The largest scientific publishers have decided to close access to their database of articles in Russia. At the same time, publishing houses will continue to publish articles by Russian and Belarusian scientists. The relevant statement was published on March 31.

Life considering hostilities

Ukraine has created a service for sending e-mails after the war. Messages are stored in a secure database, and after the war, the developers will automatically send them to recipients. ""Write something important today to those you think about, and after the war, they will receive your letter. You can even write to yourself as a memory of those times,"" the authors of the idea comment.

260,000 temporarily displaced people have registered with the social security authorities, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said at a Cabinet meeting today. If we take into account that, according to the UN, at least 10.5 million people in Ukraine have currently moved out of their homes, only 2.5% have registered.

Kyiv and region

Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klychko has said that the bombing of the Ukrainian capital's satellite cities continues, despite Russia's promises to withdraw troops from the region. On Sky News, Klychko said that the fighting continues in Brovary, east of Kyiv. ""Those who want to return to Kyiv, it is better to wait a few weeks to see how the situation will develop,"" summed up the mayor.

In Irpin, liberated from the occupiers, authorities managed to restore communication thanks to Starlink. According to Vodafone spokeswoman Viktoria Ruban, this is the first case in Ukraine and the second in the world when the work of a part of the mobile operator's network is organized with the help of Starlink satellite technologies.

At least $10 billion is needed to rebuild Mariupol. The mayor of the city Vadym Boichenko reported about it. This figure is a preliminary minimum estimate, which will be clarified. ""Currently, we are working closely with the Government and the Donetsk Civil-Military Administration to obtain from Russia not only reparations for the complete reconstruction of our beloved Mariupol, but also large payments to all Mariupol residents for suffering and damage,"" Boichenko said.

This story contains graphic photos and video, including images of bodies found in Bucha, Ukraine. ODESSA, Ukraine — Haunting images of dead bodies littering the streets of a Kyiv suburb and reports of civilian executions are triggering new international condemnation against Russia, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky demanded accountability for what he said amounts to “genocide.”

Ukrainian officials said they have asked the International Criminal Court to visit the mass graves seen in Bucha, a suburb northwest of the capital, so that experts can gather evidence of possible Russian war crimes. European leaders supported the call for an independent investigation and pledged to hold Russia accountable for what NATO’s secretary general described as “brutality against civilians we haven’t seen in Europe for decades.”

The calls for retribution came as Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared to be regrouping and shifting his focus away from Kyiv, near where Ukrainian forces are recapturing territory, and toward the country’s south and east.

Explosions rocked Odessa early Sunday as Russia said its missiles struck an oil refinery and fuel storage facilities — the first major strikes on the strategic Black Sea port city’s downtown. Tens of thousands of people remained cut off from desperately needed aid in Mariupol, which the Red Cross still hasn’t been able to reach.

Zelensky said Ukrainians are being “destroyed and exterminated” because they refuse to be subdued by Russian forces.

“This is genocide,” Zelensky said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “We are the citizens of Ukraine. We have more than 100 nationalities. This is about the destruction and extermination of all these nationalities.”

Video posted to social media Saturday and verified by The Washington Post showed at least nine people, including one child, lying on the street of a residential area in Bucha. They appeared to be dead.

Human Rights Watch said in a statement Sunday that it had “documented several cases of Russian military forces committing laws-of-war violations against civilians in occupied areas of the Chernihiv, Kharkiv, and Kyiv regions of Ukraine.”

A Ukrainian task force has found 410 civilian bodies in the Kyiv region, Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova said Sunday.

Responding to the images from Bucha, at least three top European officials — European Council President Charles Michel, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and the European Union’s economic commissioner, Paolo Gentiloni — said they planned to impose tighter economic sanctions against Russia.

A fundamental problem, however, remains the billions of dollars’ worth of Russian oil and gas that the world continues to buy, giving the Kremlin a direct financial lifeline.

German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said the European Union should discuss banning Russian gas imports, according to her ministry.

Germany has thus far opposed calls to ban Russian energy supplies, with Chancellor Olaf Scholz saying it would devastate the German and European economies.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson vowed to do “everything in my power to starve Putin’s war machine.” He added that the United Kingdom would ramp up sanctions against Russia and bolster military support for Ukraine.

In a message posted on the Telegram app late Sunday, Zelensky asked for help in investigating and punishing the Russian forces he accused of committing atrocities against unarmed civilians in Bucha and other Ukrainian cities

Zelensky also directed remarks toward mothers of Russian soldiers he accused of executing civilians.

“What did the Ukrainian city of Bucha ever do to Russia?” he said in Russian. “You couldn’t have not known that was inside your children.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on April 3, following the discovery of mass graves in Bucha, pledged that his government would investigate “every crime.” (Video: Telegram)

The latest brutalities have prompted Biden administration officials to discuss intensifying their sanctions campaign against Russia, according to two people familiar with the matter.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” said the images of dead civilians were a “punch to the gut.”

The Russian Defense Ministry, however, claimed no civilians were harmed while it had control of Bucha. It said, without offering evidence, that Ukrainian troops had fired in the area.

The images from Bucha “are another production of the Kyiv regime for the Western media,” the statement said. It claimed the same of an attack on a maternity hospital in Mariupol last month, which also drew widespread condemnation.

Amid the condemnation, Russia requested a Monday meeting of the U.N. Security Council to discuss what Moscow’s U.N. representative, Dmitry Polyanskiy, called a “blatant provocation by Ukrainian radicals,” according to RIA, a Russian state-owned news agency.

Negotiations between Russia and Ukraine were set to resume Monday, with discussions centered on Russia’s demands for Ukraine to cede Crimea and parts of the Donbas regions in the east.

Zelensky said Sunday that peace talks would require full Russian withdrawal “to their borders that existed prior to the 24th of February at least” — a statement some are interpreting as a willingness to compromise on the eastern and southern regions of Ukraine that Russia contested before the invasion.

Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, though Ukraine still claims the southern peninsula as its own. The Kremlin has also backed separatists in two provinces of the Donbas region, which Putin recognized as independent before his invasion.

On Sunday, Russian chief negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said on Telegram that the Ukrainian side had “become more realistic” in some of its stances. However, he appeared to shut down the idea of a possible meeting between Putin and Zelensky, a day after his Ukrainian counterpart said such a sit-down between the leaders was possible.

“The draft agreement is not ready for submission to a meeting at the top,” Medinsky said on Telegram, according to a Reuters translation. “I repeat again and again: Russia’s position on Crimea and Donbas remains UNCHANGED.”

Moscow and Kyiv have held a number of negotiations, most recently in Istanbul, since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.

As Russia’s attacks appeared to shift south, the conflict in cities on the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea are coming into focus. Military analysts think the next phase of the war will primarily be a battle for southeastern Ukraine.

Odessa has long been considered a target for the Russian military because it is an economically vital port, but with Moscow’s ground forces unable to advance past Mykolaiv, about 70 miles east, Odessa has largely been spared from attacks. Local businesses and even the zoo have reopened in the past week.

Britain’s Defense Ministry said Sunday that Russia’s navy is strategically blockading the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov to prevent Ukraine from rearming.

In another battered port city, Mariupol, Ukrainians will also face “difficult” fights ahead, an adviser to Zelensky warned, as Moscow vies for a strategic victory that would free up thousands of troops to fight elsewhere.

Russia’s Defense Ministry reported that high-precision sea and air missiles had destroyed an oil refinery and three fuel storage facilities near Odessa. The claim could not be immediately verified independently by The Post.

Ukrainian officials said the fire had been extinguished, but the depot had been destroyed and could “no longer function” following Sunday’s attack.

The Odessa City Council said in a statement posted on Telegram early Sunday that the city was attacked from the air and that “some missiles were shot down by air defense.” Fires were reported in some areas, and residents were advised to close their windows and stay away while emergency responders carried out their work.

After the Odessa explosions, missile strikes were recorded in two other cities in Ukraine on Sunday, local authorities said. Missile strikes were reported in the southern port city of Mykolaiv, where a Russian rocket had hit the regional administration building on Tuesday, killing at least 36 people, according to the local authorities.

“Friends, we have several missile strikes in the city,” Alexander Senkevych, the city’s mayor, wrote in a Telegram post. He noted that information is being collected and asked the public not to publish photos or videos and let official sources do so.

A Russian missile strike also was reported in the city of Vasylkiv, southwest of Kyiv, where an air defense command center was hit.

“Today, the enemy once again launched a missile strike on the city of Vasylkiv,” a unit of the Ukrainian air force reported in a post published on Facebook, noting that some of the missiles were shot down by Ukraine’s air defense systems.

According to preliminary information, several employees of the command center — which also houses a training center and an aviation school — were injured and hospitalized, one in critical condition, according to the statement. Rescue services were going through the debris in search of survivors.

To the east, in Mariupol, where Russia has already wreaked massive destruction and deprivation, a much-needed humanitarian convoy is “yet to reach the city,” the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said Sunday.

The ICRC team of three cars and nine staffers departed Zaporizhzhia — about 140 miles from Mariupol — on Saturday morning to assist with the humanitarian operation in the battered port city, where as many as 100,000 people are still trapped after weeks of heavy fighting.

The convoy attempted to reach Mariupol on Friday but had to return to Zaporizhzhia, saying the “conditions and arrangements” made it impossible to move forward, despite assurances from Moscow of a cease-fire and safe passage for civilians, the organization said in a statement.

Thousands of desperate civilians left the eastern Ukraine city of Kramatorsk on Sunday, before an anticipated Russian offensive to seize what remains of Ukrainian-controlled territory in the eastern Donbas region.

About 5,000 people — mostly women, children and the elderly — boarded trains heading to the relative safety of western Ukraine. The mood was solemn as families said goodbye to loved ones, unsure when or whether they would see them again.

“Everything changed over the past three days; more and more families are leaving,” said Julia Jiakovlea, 34, who decided to leave Saturday evening.

The Ukrainian government has for weeks been urging the White House to expand its sanctions campaign to more dramatically cut Russia off from the global economy.

Ukraine has pressed the administration to curb Russian vessels’ access to international waterways, choke off its energy exports, and sanctions far more government officials and allies of Putin. Europe continues to depend on Russian energy, and cutting off that vital financial lifeline could devastate the European economies.

But it is not clear which escalatory measures would be proportional to the gruesome scenes emerging in Ukraine. Richard Nephew, a senior research scholar at Columbia University, said it has been long understood that human rights violations would trigger more sanctions. But he pointed out that Russian military tactics do not appear driven by U.S. sanctions, and it would be hard to design new measures commensurate with the damage done.

“The real problem they’re going to have with the sanctions response is it will be seen as insufficient pretty much no matter what you do. The humanitarian atrocity committed will always be much worse than a sanctions response,” Nephew said. “There’s nothing proportional to a massacre being committed.”

The details of the retaliatory steps being considered by the United States aren’t clear, but senior Biden officials have previously discussed potentially devastating “secondary sanctions” that would target countries that continue to trade with Russia. Officials stressed that planning was preliminary and that no decisions had been made about potential responses.

The Biden administration could also impose sanctions on sectors of the Russian economy that they have not hit so far, including mining, transportation and additional parts of the Russian financial sector.

Blinken told CNN that the United States and its European partners are discussing new sanctions to impose on Russia “every single day.” Blinken stressed that the measures so far are already projected to cause Russia’s economy to decline by 10 percent this year, but condemned Russia’s “brutality” and said more measures are likely necessary.

“These sanctions are having a big bite now. They’re going to have a big bite going forward as long as this lasts, and we are every single day making sure that they’re not only tightened, but increased,” Blinken said.

A Treasury spokeswoman declined to comment. State Department spokesman Ned Price said, “We’ll continue to escalate the pressure until and unless the Kremlin relents, but we’re not going to preview specific sanctions.”

Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton said Russia should be isolated from international organizations and urged the Group of 20 to bar Russian officials from its summit later this year, calling it necessary punishment for the invasion of Ukraine.

“I think there is an upcoming G-20 event later in the year — I would not permit Russia to attend,” Clinton said on NBC News’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday. “And if they insisted on literally showing up, I would hope there would be a significant, if not total, boycott. The only way that we’re going to end the bloodshed and the terror that we’re seeing unleashed in Ukraine and protect Europe and democracy is to do everything we can to impose even greater costs on Putin.

MUKACHEVO, Ukraine — Ukrainian troops recaptured territory around Kyiv on Saturday as Russian forces pulled back from towns they had seized in the opening days of the war and left in their wake scenes of destruction and horror, including the abandoned bodies of dead civilians. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight Journalists entered the town of Bucha, a suburb northwest of the capital, and saw numerous corpses strewn on the streets. Video posted to social media and verified by The Washington Post showed what appeared to be at least nine dead, including one child.

Bucha’s mayor, Anatoly Fedoruk, said in an interview that around 270 local residents had been buried in two mass graves. He estimated that 40 people were lying dead in the streets. Some had been bound and executed — shot in the back of the head, he said.

The mayor added that officials are worried that the bodies could be booby-trapped with explosives. In a video address to Ukrainians early Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia was “mining the whole territory.”

“They are mining homes, mining equipment, even the bodies of people who were killed,” he said. The Post has not verified those claims.

Revelations of atrocities and alleged war crimes, including reports of soldiers firing on civilian protesters in the east, cast a pall over what has in some ways been a hopeful period for Ukrainians as they resist the Russian invaders.

The capital appears safe for the moment, but at the same time, shelling and intense fighting in the east and south of the country are continuing. Efforts to rescue civilians in besieged cities have been slowed by the extremely dangerous conditions on the ground.

The war, in its 38th day, remained a grinding conflict with no clear resolution in sight. The Russian strategic pivot may foreshadow a long war of attrition. That would prolong the already severe humanitarian crisis in which millions of Ukrainians have fled their homes, becoming refugees in neighboring countries.

A cease-fire in the largely destroyed coastal city of Mariupol has been in place for several days, creating a corridor to leave the city. A team from the Red Cross failed to reach the city Friday or Saturday, citing the unsafe environment. A Red Cross spokesperson emailed a note with few details saying that teams are en route but have yet to reach Mariupol.

Western military analysts are still trying to interpret the decision by Russian military commanders to reposition their forces. Russian officials have said they are concentrating their forces in the eastern part of the country. The repositioning could signal an intense battle for control of the Donbas region. It appears that, at least for now, Russian President Vladimir Putin has recalculated what he can and can’t achieve with his invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine’s deputy defense minister, Anna Malyar, said late Saturday that the entire Kyiv administrative region is fully under Ukrainian control.

Zelensky had said earlier that the movement of Russian forces was “slow but noticeable.”

But he continued his ongoing appeal to allied nations to do more to aid his war-scorched country. He cited the suffering in Mariupol, where tens of thousands of residents have been trying to survive amid the rubble.

“Europe has no right to react in silence to what is happening in our Mariupol. The whole world must react to this humanitarian catastrophe,” Zelensky said in his video address.

Zelensky’s demand for help came amid significant battlefield developments that potentially could alter the geography of the war.

If, as some Western analysts believe, Putin focuses on expanding his control of territory in the east, it would open a broad corridor between Russia and the Crimean peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014. But a more limited strategic goal could undermine support within Russia for the war effort.

But after Moscow’s negotiators agreed in talks with Ukraine to de-escalate the fighting around Kyiv and Chernihiv, and focus instead on the eastern Donbas region, propagandists and pro-war politicians expressed dismay. Prominent state television anchor Vladimir Solovyov said Thursday that “that any negotiation with the Nazis until the boot is on their throat is weakness. You shouldn’t shake hands with this creep,” he said, apparently referring to Zelensky.

Another pro-Kremlin journalist and blogger Semyon Pegov, from the outlet War Gonzo, which reports from the Russian side of the war, said the invasion was just beginning and that Russia would continue “to the end.” He called Russian soldiers “real Russian heroes.”

“No one and nothing will take away their feat from them,” he posted to Telegram on Friday. “It’s already gone down in history.”

As part of their retreat, Russian forces abandoned an airport seized at the start of the invasion. Near the border with Belarus, Ukrainian forces regained control of the disabled Chernobyl nuclear power plant that had been attacked and captured by Russian forces. The national flag once again was raised over the plant.

The repositioning of troops so far has been relatively modest and is possibly a tactic to fool the Ukrainians into lowering their defensive posture in the capital, Brookings Institution defense analyst Michael O’Hanlon said Saturday. He added the Russians may be hoping that Zelensky reveals his whereabouts.

“If they can get the Ukrainians to lower their guard, that would be for them potentially an opportunity to make a strike against Zelensky and/or his inner circle and the top tier of the government,” O’Hanlon said. “I still think there’s a possibility that they’re trying to lure the Ukrainians into making a mistake.”

On-and-off negotiations for a broad cease-fire have been on again in recent days, but the sincerity of the Russians at the table has been questioned by their Ukrainian counterparts. They fear, as do security analysts in the West, that Russian gestures toward a cease-fire and a negotiated peace could be a diversion to help the attackers reposition their forces after the initial thrust of the invasion yielded disappointing results.

According to Ukrainian media reports, David Arakhamia, the head of the Ukrainian delegation to the talks, said officials are preparing for a possible meeting between Zelensky and Putin in Turkey.

Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych told national television that Ukrainians should prepare for “difficult fights” ahead in Mariupol and in the southern and eastern regions of the country.

In the east, four people were “injured and severely burned” after Russian forces fired mortars at protesters in a city near Zaporizhzhia, the site of a nuclear plant that Russia captured last month, according to Ukraine’s human rights ombudswoman.

Residents of Enerhodar, a satellite town of Zaporizhzhia, which has been occupied by Russian forces for nearly four weeks, held a rally in support of Ukraine on Saturday. Russian soldiers used light and noise grenades to disrupt the protest and opened mortar fire on residents, the ombudswoman, Lyudmyla Denisova, said in a statement posted to Telegram.

“Such treatment of civilians is a crime against humanity and a war crime as defined by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court,” Denisova said.

The Washington Post verified two videos recorded by witnesses and posted to Telegram. The images were filmed at the same time from separate angles and show at least nine flashes followed by large booms. Gunfire is audible as people run away from the site of the protest.

“There is a fight in the city center!” a man yells in a third video, verified by The Post, while rushing away from multiple loud booms. “Russian occupiers attacked civilians. There was a peaceful protest here.”

Tens of thousands of people in recent weeks have fled Ukrainian cities under attack by Russian forces after Kyiv and Moscow agreed on fragile evacuation deals.

Across Ukraine, seven humanitarian corridors have been established, according to Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk, including the one from Mariupol. She said in a Telegram post that more than 6,000 people were evacuated from front-line cities to other parts of the country on Friday.

Vereshchuk said those evacuees included more than 1,400 people who left in their vehicles along planned routes from the southern cities of Berdyansk and Melitopol, which are under Russian control, to the nearby Zaporizhzhia region.

Among them were hundreds of people from Mariupol who had managed to escape in private vehicles. Separately, she said, a convoy of 42 buses carried Mariupol residents to Zaporizhzhia from Berdyansk, which they had previously reached on their own.

In southern Ukraine, the death toll from a missile strike that hit a main government building in the city of Mykolaiv this week has risen to 32, the governor of the region, Vitaliy Kim, said Saturday on Telegram.

Dozens of people remain unaccounted for after that attack blasted a hole through part of the building, Dmytro Pletenchuk, a press officer of the Mykolaiv Regional State Administration, said earlier. More than 30 people were injured, he said as rescue workers continued to clear rubble Friday and funerals were held for many of the victims.

The war continues to stir tensions globally and could have ramifications in low Earth orbit: The director of Russia’s space agency suggested he would submit a proposal to end his country’s cooperation in the International Space Station program.

In tweets on Saturday, Dmitry Rogozin, head of the agency Roscosmos, pointed to sanctions against a “number of enterprises in the Russian rocket and space industry.” He said that he appealed to the heads of NASA, the Canadian Space Agency and the European Space Agency to lift sanctions and that in their responses, the “position of our partners is clear: the sanctions will not be lifted.”

“I believe that the restoration of normal relations between partners in the International Space Station and other joint projects is possible only with the complete and unconditional lifting of illegal sanctions,” Rogozin wrote.

Rogozin has frequently used threatening and blustery rhetoric, including to repeatedly suggest Russia could exit the partnership. His latest remarks came three days after two Russian cosmonauts and a NASA astronaut returned from the space station, a symbol of partnership in space even amid mounting tensions over the war in Ukraine.

Since Russian forces invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, NASA has maintained that the station has been operating as normal, unaffected by the conflict. NASA has said it would be unable to operate the space station without the Russians because the nation provides the propulsion necessary to keep the station in orbit.

In China, officials on Saturday renewed their criticism of sanctions placed on Russia. The remarks came a day after a high-level virtual summit between China and the European Union.

“We oppose sanctions, and the effects of these sanctions also risk spilling to the rest of the world,” Wang Lutong, director general of European affairs at China’s Foreign Ministry, told reporters on Saturday.

Since Russian forces invaded Ukraine, E.U. leaders have taken a tougher stance on China, urging it to drop its tacit support for the invasion and work for peace — but Beijing is pushing back.

“China is not a related party on the crisis of Ukraine. We don’t think our normal trade with any other country should be affected,” Wang said. He added that China is contributing to the global economy by conducting normal trade with Russia.

Pope Francis said Saturday that he is considering making a trip to Kyiv. While traveling from Rome to Malta, the leader of the Roman Catholic Church was asked by a reporter on his plane whether a visit to Ukraine was a possibility following invitations from Ukrainian political and religious officials.

“Yes, it is on the table,” Francis answered, but he offered no further details, according to Reuters.

Zelensky has spoken twice with the pope by telephone, according to the Vatican, and along with Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko has extended invitations to Francis to visit Ukraine. The country has a sizable Roman Catholic population. However, most Ukrainian Catholics identify with the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.

Francis has vocally condemned the war in Ukraine, calling it a “senseless massacre where every day slaughters and atrocities are being repeated.”

More than a month after the UK's Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme was launched, thousands of sponsors are still waiting to welcome Ukrainian nationals, amid reports of red tape and bureaucracy in the process.

Lynette Protheroe, from Derbyshire, was matched with sisters Yana and Inna and their three children on 20 March but weeks after submitting an application, she says she still has no way to track its progress.

""The system is shambolic and it is failing these people,"" Ms Protheroe told Sky News.

""You can order some balloons from China and you can track it and you know where it's coming from, you know where it is.

""You can generally tell when it will be delivered. You cannot track these visa applications. There's no way the family can track them. You just have to wait.""
