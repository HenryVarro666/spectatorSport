The German government is declaring 40 Russian diplomats “undesirable persons”, foreign minister Annalena Baerbock has said, an act that is tantamount to expulsion from the country.

The announcement on Monday follows similar moves by European partners in recent days as a reaction to Russia’s war in Ukraine.

Shortly after the German announcement, France said it would expel 35 Russian diplomats as part of a joint European action. Earlier on Monday, Lithuania threw out its Russian ambassador.

Speaking as Russia faced growing global criticism over allegations that its forces had committed atrocities in Bucha, a town near Kyiv, Germany’s Baerbock said the move was a response to the “unbelievable brutality” the Kremlin had unleashed in Ukraine.

“The images from Bucha speak to unbelievable brutality by the Russian leadership and by those who follow its propaganda with a boundless will to exterminate,” Baerbock said.

Moscow said the German decision to expel a number of Russian diplomats was “unfriendly” and would worsen ties.

“The unfounded reduction in the number of diplomatic staff at Russian missions in Germany will narrow the space for maintaining dialogue between our countries, which will lead to a further deterioration in Russian-German relations,” the Russian embassy in Berlin said in a statement posted on Telegram.

Later on Monday, France announced it would expel dozens of Russian diplomats.

“France decided this evening to expel a number of Russian personnel with diplomatic status stationed in France whose activities are against our security interests,” the French foreign ministry said in a statement.

Dozens of bodies were found in mass graves or littering the streets following the withdrawal of Russian forces from Bucha.

The Kremlin has denied Western allegations that Russian forces were responsible for killing civilians in Bucha.

However, Baerbock said “similar images” were to be feared “in other places that Russian troops have occupied”.

She said it was essential to “stand up for our freedom and be prepared to defend it”.

“That is why the German government has decided to declare a significant number of staff of the Russian embassy, who have worked every day here in Germany against our freedom, against the cohesion of our society, as persona non grata,” she said.

Diplomats a ‘threat’

Baerbock described the diplomats’ presence “as a threat” to the more than 300,000 Ukrainians “who have sought protection here” since the invasion began.

“We will no longer tolerate that, we communicated that to the Russian ambassador this afternoon,” she said.

Baerbock said Germany would take further steps “with our partners” including “imposing harsher sanctions on Russia, decisively expanding support for Ukraine’s fighting forces and bolstering NATO’s eastern flank”.

Earlier, Lithuania said it was expelling the Russian ambassador and would close Russia’s consulate in the port city of Klaipeda. It said its envoy to Moscow “would return in the near future”.

“Lithuania stands in full solidarity with Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, who are victims of Russia’s unprecedented aggression,” foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said in a statement.

“The war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by the Russian armed forces in Ukraine will not be forgotten,” he added.

Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said the evidence of civilian killings from Bucha was just the “tip of the iceberg” and showed the need for tougher sanctions on Moscow.

“Half measures are not enough any more. I demand most severe sanctions this week, this is the plea of the victims of the rapes and killings. If you have doubts about sanctions go to Bucha first,” he said during a press conference with British foreign minister Liz Truss.

US President Joe Biden on Monday repeated his accusation that Putin was a war criminal and he called for a war crimes trial. Putin “is brutal. And what’s happening in Bucha is outrageous, and everyone’s seen it,” Biden told reporters.

The US and its allies have sought to punish Russia for the invasion by imposing sweeping sanctions but fear further harm to the global economy, which is still recovering from the pandemic. Europe is in a particular bind, since it gets 40 percent of its gas and 25 percent of its oil from Russia.

Putin’s February 24 invasion has left thousands of people dead, according to Ukrainian authorities, and forced more than 4 million Ukrainians to flee their country.

Putin has said the attack is aimed at eliminating a security threat and has demanded that Ukraine drop its bid to join NATO. Kyiv and its allies say the invasion is a war of aggression.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/4/germany-expelling-substantial-russian-diplomats-minister

BERLIN — The German and French governments announced Monday that they will expel a number of Russian embassy staff following reports of atrocities in the Ukrainian city of Bucha.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock cited the reports from Bucha directly as a reason for the expulsions, saying it highlighted the Kremlin’s “unbelievable brutality,” and that “we must counter this inhumanity with the strength of our freedom and our humanity.”

“The government has therefore decided today to declare undesirable a significant number of members of the Russian embassy who have worked here in Germany every day against our freedom, against the cohesion of our society,” Baerbock said, adding that she had informed the Russian ambassador that “we will not tolerate this any longer.”

A spokesman for the French foreign ministry did not mention Bucha in an official statement, but said France would expel “many” Russian diplomatic personnel “whose activities are contrary to our security interests.”

After Ukrainians reclaimed towns like Bucha around Kyiv from Russian troops, officials and NGOs reported over the weekend that Russian forces had massacred and raped civilians, releasing graphic images that have been condemned internationally.

Baerbock vowed that sanctions against Moscow would be ramped up in response.

“We will continue to tighten existing sanctions against Russia, we will decisively increase our support to Ukrainian armed forces, and we will also strengthen NATO’s eastern flank,” she said.

The reports from Bucha have ratcheted up the debate within Germany about whether the country should end Russian energy imports completely and immediately to hurt the Kremlin financially and send a clear sign of support to Ukraine — a move demanded both by Kyiv and neighboring Poland.

However, Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Economy Minister Robert Habeck have so far warned that making a rash decision could trigger a massive recession in Europe and could do more harm than good for all sides, although many economists and other politicians disagree.

Earlier on Monday, Habeck announced that the German subsidiary of Russian gas company Gazprom would temporarily be put under state control in a further escalation of the energy conflict surrounding the war in Ukraine.

“The government is doing what is necessary to ensure security of supply in Germany — this includes not exposing energy infrastructures in Germany to arbitrary decisions by the Kremlin,” Habeck said.

Also on Monday, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier for the first time publicly said that Berlin had made a mistake by sticking to the controversial Russian gas pipeline project Nord Stream 2 for so long. Scholz reversed course on the pipeline in February just days before Russia invaded Ukraine, and the project is now dead.

“We held on to bridges that Russia no longer believed in and that our partners warned us about,” Steinmeier said.

5,000 civilians have died in Mariupol siege, says mayor

Mariupol mayor Vadym Boichenko said that over 5,000 civilians have been killed during Russia's siege of the strategic port city over the last month.

Boichenko added that more than 90% of the city's infrastructure was destroyed by Russian shelling. Russian forces have also bombed hospitals, including one where 50 people burned to death, he said.

On Wednesday, Ukrainian President Vlodomyr Zelenskyy said Russia was blocking humanitarian access to Mariupol because it wants to conceal evidence of ""thousands"" of people who have been killed there.

""They will not be able to hide all of this and bury all of these Ukrainians who died and who are injured. It's just such a number, it's thousands of people, it's impossible to hide,"" he said.

Red Cross brings Mariupol refugees to safety

A convoy of seven buses and at least 40 private cars carrying Ukrainian evacuees led by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) arrived in Zaporizhzhia, a city in southeast Ukraine.

The convoy had attempted to reach the besieged city of Mariupol 200 kilometers (120 miles) southeast but was unable to make it that far.

The ICRC said on Twitter that around 1,000 evacuees in total were escorted to Zaporizhzhia in the operation.

Most of them had been able to flee Mariupol on their own and were evacuated from nearby Berdiansk, where they had hunkered down after being internally displaced.

ICRC spokesperson Lucile Marbeau said, "" These people have really gone through the worst.""

""This convoy's arrival to Zaporizhzhia is a huge relief for hundreds of people who have suffered immensely and are now in a safer location. It's clear, though, that thousands more civilians trapped inside Mariupol need safe passage out and aid to come in,"" Pascal Hundt, the ICRC's head of delegation in Ukraine, said in a statement.

NATO expects Ukraine war could last 'years'

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said Russian President Vladimir Putin is unlikely to give up on his ambition to control Ukraine, and warned that the war could ""for many months, for even years.""

Stoltenberg added that NATO intelligence indicates Russia is preparing for a major offensive in eastern Ukraine with the aim of capturing the entire Donbas region to create a land bridge between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula.

""We need to support Ukraine, sustain our sanctions and strengthen our defenses and our deterrence,"" he told reporters in Brussels at the opening of a two-day meeting of NATO foreign ministers.

Liana Fix, a historian and political scientist with the Körber Foundation in Germany, told DW that it is clear NATO is trying to establish a ""red line"" when responding to extreme escalation by Russia, including deployment of chemical or tactical nuclear weapons.

""There are no details given on what a strong response would look like,"" she said. ""The only difficulty there is that, for instance, President Obama established a red line in Syria which was crossed and there were no significant consequences,"" she added.

US sanctions Putin's daughters and top Russian banks

The US has said it will impose ""severe and immediate economic costs on the Putin regime for its atrocities in Ukraine, including in Bucha.""

This includes freezing the US assets of Putin's daughters, Mariya Vorontsova and Katerina Tikhonova, and cutting them off from the US financial system.

Washington also said it will apply ""full blocking"" sanctions on Sberbank and Alfa Bank, Russia's largest public and private financial institutions.

This will block exposure of the bank's assets to the US financial system and prohibit US persons from doing business with them.

Other Russian elite targeted are Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, the wife and children of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, and members of Russia's Security Council, including former President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev.

""These individuals have enriched themselves at the expense of the Russian people. Some of them are responsible for providing the support necessary to underpin Putin’s war on Ukraine,"" a White House statement said.

Washington said the new sanctions were in response to ""war crimes"" committed by Russian forces in Ukraine.

On Tuesday, the European Commission proposed its next raft of Russia sanctions, with officials in Brussels saying a decision is expected by the end of this week.

EU has spent €35 billion on Russian energy since start of Ukraine war

Speaking to the European Parliament, EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said that the bloc had spent €35 billion ($38 million) on Russian gas, oil and coal since the Ukraine war began in late February.

Borrell cited the number to reemphasize the importance of reducing the EU's dependence on Russian energy imports.

""A billion euro is what we pay Putin every day for the energy he provides us since the beginning of the war. We have given him €35 billion. Compare that to the €1 billion that we have given to the Ukraine in arms and weapons,'' Borrell said.

He added the EU would need to expand renewable energy to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, and that the fight against climate change now goes hand in hand with geopolitics.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin and urged an immediate cease-fire in Ukraine.

""His response was positive, but with conditions,"" Orban told a press conference, without elaborating.

Orban also said that Hungary would not have a problem paying for Russian gas in rubles if asked to do so by Moscow. He added that Hungary does not support expanding EU sanctions to oil and gas imports from Russia.

Russia is demanding that EU countries pay for gas imports in rubles in a bid to prop up the currency. However, most European countries have refused, saying existing contracts are set in euros or dollars.

""When we are hearing new rhetoric about sanctions ... I can't tolerate any indecisiveness after everything that Russian troops have done,"" he said referring to the atrocities revealed recently in Bucha.

""The only thing that we are lacking is the principled approach of some leaders — political leaders, business leaders — who still think that war and war crimes are not something as horrific as financial losses,"" added Zelenskyy.

The Ukrainian president also called on Ireland to convince its European Union partners to introduce ""more rigid"" measures against Russia.

""The truth and the cause of the incident must be verified,"" Zhao said. ""All parties should exercise restraint and avoid unfounded accusations before a conclusion of the investigation is drawn.""

EU leaders consider more energy sanctions on Russia

The European Union will have to ban oil and gas imports from Russia to put pressure on Moscow to stop its war in Ukraine, EU Council President Charles Michel said on Wednesday.

""I think that measures on oil and even gas will also be needed sooner or later,"" Michel told the European Parliament.

So far, EU leaders are considering a ban on Russian coal — but not oil or gas — as part of a new package of sanctions in response to possible war crimes in Bucha.

""Now we have to look into oil and revenues Russia gets from fossil fuels,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the European lawmakers.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Tuesday the EU was working on a plan to end purchases of Russian fossil fuels altogether.

Austria and Hungary, however, were opposed to Russian oil and gas sanctions.

According to the International Energy Agency, Russian natural gas accounted for almost 40% of European Union gas demand in 2021.

The EU is the second-largest importer of Russian oil after China.

Ukraine's minister for foreign affairs, Dmytro Kuleba, has called on the EU to go further, saying ""difficult times require difficult decisions.""

US general: Ukraine conflict could last for 'years'

General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the US Department of Defense, said in testimony to Congress that the war in Ukraine could last for years.

""I do think this is a very protracted conflict and I think it is at least measured in years,"" Milley said.

Milley added that the US and other countries supporting Ukraine will be ""involved in this for quite some time.""

The general said that the US should establish ""permanent bases"" in eastern Europe, but with ""rotational"" rather than permanently stationed troops.

""My advice would be to create permanent bases but don't permanently station (forces), so you get the effect of permanence by rotational forces cycling through permanent bases,"" Milley said, adding that the Baltic States, Romania and Poland would be willing to pay for such bases.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said that expansion of the US military presence in eastern Europe was a ""work in progress,"" adding that the issue will probably be discussed at the NATO summit in June.

Russian forces responsible for atrocities in Bucha — Pentagon

The US Department of Defense said that Russian forces are responsible for atrocities committed in the Ukrainian town of Bucha.

Bucha is located in the Kyiv region, lying just outside Ukraine's capital and adjacent to the town of Irpin.

""I think it's fairly obvious - not just to us, but to the world - that Russian forces are responsible for the atrocities in Bucha,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said.

""Now, exactly who, what units, whether they're contractors or Chechens, I don't think we're able to say right now,"" Kirby said.

""But we're certainly not refuting that these atrocities occurred, and that they occurred at the hands of Russians.""

Ukraine accused Russia of committing a massacre in Bucha after pictures surfaced that showed bodies lying in the town's streets.

France to expel Russian diplomats

France said late on Monday that it would expel a number of Russian diplomats.

France's foreign affairs ministry said that the activities of the diplomats went against the country's ""security interests.""

The ministry said this was part of a joint European action.

Medvedev: Russia will react harshly to expulsion of diplomats

Deputy chairman of Russia's security council and former president Dmitry Medvedev said that Moscow would respond harshly to the expulsion of diplomats from Western countries.

""It will be symmetrical and destructive for bilateral relations,"" Medvedev said.

Medvedev called the expulsion of diplomats a ""senseless"" practice that ""leads nowhere.""

HRW legal advisor 'pretty optimistic' war crimes cases will materialize

Human Rights Watch (HRW) senior legal advisor Aisling Reidy told DW that the organization, like several other international organs, was just beginning its investigation into what happened at Bucha and other Ukrainian communities during Russian occupation.

But Reidy said that while HRW did not have enough information to see the full scope of the events, they did have witnesses.

""We do know that there have been war crimes, that we've spoken to people who witnessed war crimes having been committed there,"" Reidy said.

""We were able to document one witness account of a woman who had you know, actually, eye witnessed a summary execution where men had been lined up in a row for them kneeling down, and one of them had their t-shirt pulled over their head and then was shot in the back of the head,"" she said.

Reidy said she believed it was ""quite likely"" that those responsible for the crimes could be found, given that a lot of information about the Russian military and its operations exists.

""I think there's going to be evidence there of who was operating where when different war crimes were committed. There's going to be, in some extent, you know, eyewitness testimony that may help narrow down who's responsible.""

Reidy said that the International Criminal Court would likely seek individuals who bear the most responsibility.

""[This] may not mean the person who pulled the trigger on the ground, but who is in charge of that particular operation, who was the commander and should have known what was going on, could have prevented it, fail to punish it, and that's known as command responsibility,"" she said.

Extraditing Russian soldiers or officials to international courts could prove rather more challenging, however.

Biden repeats that Putin is a 'war criminal'

US President Joe Biden on Monday said that Russian President Vladimir Putin is a ""war criminal."" Similar comments have drawn critical responses from Moscow in the past.

""This guy is brutal, and what's happening in Bucha is outragreous,"" said Biden, also pledging further sanctions against Russia.

Biden however stopped short of using the word ""genocide"" employed by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Germany expels Russian diplomats

Germany declared 40 Russian diplomats ""undesirable persons,"" meaning they must return to Russia, Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock announced. The affected individuals, whom Berlin believes to be members of Russia's intelligence services, will have five days to leave Germany.

Baerbock spoke of ""a significant number of members of the Russian embassy, undesirables who have worked every day here in Germany against our freedom, against the cohesion of our society.""

""We will not tolerate this any longer,"" she said.

The decision was communicated to Russian Ambassador Sergei Nethayev, after he was summoned to the Foreign Ministry on Monday.

The Russian Foreign Ministry said it would respond accordingly to Germany's decision to expel the 40 Russian diplomats, according to Interfax news agency. Though details on how Moscow would respond were not provided, tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions have been very common in recent weeks, months and even years.

Germany puts Gazprom Germania under state trusteeship

Economy Minister Robert Habeck said on Monday that he had appointed the German government's regulator for electricity, gas and other core industries in temporary control of the German subsidiary of Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom.

Gazprom had announced on Friday that it was separating from its Gazprom Germania subsidiary, having previously been the sole owner. It did not make clear whether the organization had been sold, or who it planned to leave in control.

Habeck said that the company controlled critical infrastructure in Germany and that the lack of clarity over its ownership led to the temporary step. The Bundesnetzagentur regulator is scheduled to control the company until the end of September.

""Ordering the trusteeship serves both the maintenance of public security and order and the maintenance of supply security,"" Habeck said. ""Gazprom Germania GmbH [plc] with its headquarters in Berlin is a domestic company.""

The company is primarily involved in gas trade, transportation and storage, and owns other companies in the German gas industry.

EU ready to send investigators following Bucha discoveries — von der Leyen

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU was ready to send investigators to probe possible war crimes.

Von der Leyen's comments came following talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about what she called ""the dreadful murders that have been uncovered in Bucha.""

A Joint Investigation Team has been established with Ukraine, according to von der Leyen, and it will ""collect evidence and investigate war crimes and crimes against humanity.""

Investigation teams were on hand and ready to be sent to support Ukraine Prosecution Services, and relevant authorities were ready to assist.

Von der Leyen stressed the need for a global response saying talks were ongoing between the EU's cross-border criminal justice agency and the International Criminal Court for a joint investigative approach.

Merkel defends 2008 NATO decision on Ukraine membership

Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel has defended the decision not to admit Ukraine into NATO in 2008.

This follows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy calling out Merkel and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy by name late on Sunday when talking about the alleged killing of civilians in Bucha. Zelenskyy said France and Germany's reported resistance to a bid to fast track Ukraine's NATO membership had proven to be a failed policy.

""Former German Chancellor Dr Angela Merkel stands by her decisions in connection with the 2008 NATO summit in Bucharest,"" a spokesperson for Merkel told German news agency dpa.

The statement also said that, in light of the images from Bucha, international and German efforts to stop the conflict had Merkel's ""full support.""

Ukraine had requested NATO membership in 2008 at a summit in Romania, but the request was rejected by EU member states.

Germany's comparative closeness to Russia has come under scrutiny more generally in recent weeks, hitting both the country's major parties.

Social Democrat former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder has faced particular criticism for his post-politics ties to Russian oil and gas, but Ukraine's ambassador in Berlin on Sunday also singled out current President Frank-Walter Steinmeier as partly to blame, given his past as foreign minister.

Oligarch's superyacht seized by Spanish police

Spanish authorities on Monday impounded a superyacht belonging to Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg. The vessel which is valued at $99 million (€90 million euros) was seized in a shipyard in Mallorca at the request of US authorities.

Documents and storage devices were among the items seized.

Vekselberg's ship is the first Russian yacht seized by the US under sanctions imposed after the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine.

""It will not be the last.'' Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. ""Together, with our international partners, we will do everything possible to hold accountable any individual whose criminal acts enable the Russian government to continue its unjust war,'' he added.

Vekselberg, who was born in Ukraine, is not on the list of individuals sanctioned by the EU in response to the invasion of Ukraine. However, he was placed on a US sanctions list relating to allegations of interference in the 2016 US presidential elections, and is on a list of people close to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Vekselberg has a long history of ties to the US. In the past, he was a green card holder and had homes in New York and Connecticut.

Vekselberg has been a major player in aluminium. He ranks among the wealthiest people in Russia and owns the world's largest collection of Faberge eggs.

Viktor Vekselberg is among the wealthiest individuals and is considered to be in Russian President Vladimir Putin's inner circle

Radiological risks in Chernobyl exclusion zone overstated

In the past weeks, Ukrainian authorities have sounded the alarm about the radiological risks in the Chernobyl exclusion zone from wildfires and dust caused by Russian hostilities, heavy vehicles and trench-digging.

However, scientists have told DW that the facts have been misconstrued and the radiological risks from the exclusion zone have been overstated. Before Ukrainian forces retook Chernobyl, the country’s parliamentary Human Rights Commissioner Liudmyla Denisova claimed that 10,000 hectares of the Chernobyl exclusion zone were uncontrollably ablaze, causing risks of cross-border radioactive air pollution. The claims and warnings were repeated by Ukrainian parliamentarians and news outlets.

However, the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS), which detects and monitors wildfires from space, told DW that just 1,000 hectares had caught fire within 50 kilometers (31 miles) of Chernobyl and are no longer ablaze. These months usually have elevated fire risks anyway, due to agricultural practices.

Even if the whole area did catch fire, the radiological risks are low. Valery Kashparov, Director of Ukrainian Institute of Agricultural Radiology (UIAR), told DW that the supposed risks are “the opinion of incompetent people.” Kashparov said fires in the exclusion zone do not pose a radiological hazard to the population outside the Chernobyl zone or to firefighters.

He said claims of Russian soldiers receiving radiation poisoning were impossible, unless they were actually inside the destroyed fourth unit of the power plant or the radioactive waste storage facilities, of which there is no evidence.

Nikolaos Evangeliou, a scientist at the Norwegian Institute for Air Research who has studied Chernobyl and Fukushima extensively, told DW that modelling of fires in the exclusion zone found even catastrophic burning presented insignificant dangers for the European population.

Evangeliou said although the dust in the exclusion zone is radioactive, the muddy conditions in Ukraine at the moment mean it is unlikely that any dust will be thrown into the atmosphere. It may be a different story if the war continues into summer.

The most worrying scenario for Evangeliou, from a radiological standpoint, is the risk of a missile hitting a nuclear site. To this end, he has released daily models of possible cross-border outcomes from a major nuclear incident in Ukraine. However, for Ukrainians, Russian behavior around Chernobyl presented an intolerable risk that brought back memories of the initial disaster.

US seeks Russia's suspension from Human Rights Council

In response to Ukrainian accusations of war crimes carried out by Russian forces, the US has said that it will ask the UN General Assembly to suspend Russia from its position on the Human Rights Council.

""Russia's participation on the Human Rights Council is a farce,"" US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said during a visit to Romania. ""And it is wrong, which is why we believe it is time the UN General Assembly vote to remove them,"" she added.

Russia is in its second term out of three sitting in the Geneva-based council. A two-thirds majority vote can oust any member for systemic violations of human rights.

The UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet expressed her horror on Monday after seeing the images coming out of Bucha.

""I am horrified by the images of civilians lying dead on the streets and in improvised graves in the town of Bucha in Ukraine,"" she said in a statement.

""Reports emerging from this and other areas raise serious and disturbing questions about possible war crimes, grave breaches of international humanitarian law and serious violations of international human rights law,"" she added.

Germany condemns scenes from Bucha

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock joined the many voices condemning the mass killing of civilians in the town of Bucha outside Kyiv.

""The pictures out of Kyiv are unbearable,"" Baerbock wrote on Twitter. ""Putin's unrestrained violence is wiping out innocent families and knows no limits.""

She also called for those responsible to be brought to justice and for further sanctions against Moscow.

""Those who are responsible for these war crimes must be held to account. We will increase our sanctions against Russia and strengthen our support for Ukraine,"" she added.

Sumy towns free of Russian troops, governor says

The governor of the northern Ukrainian region of Sumy, Dmytro Zhivitsky, said on Monday that there were no longer any Russian troops in towns or villages in the region.

Sumy lies on the border with Belarus and parts of it had been occupied for almost a month. Zhivitsky said in a video message that the Russian forces had left behind lots of military equipment.

The news agency RBK Ukraina also said that the road between Kyiv and Chernihiv was once again open on Monday. The mayor of the city, which is 130 kilometers (80 miles) north of Kyiv, said that Russian shelling had destroyed 70% of the city.

Kremlin denies accusations of civilian killings

Moscow has again denied the accusations from Ukraine that Russian forces carried out mass killings in towns around the capital, Kyiv, while they were under Russian control.

""We categorically deny any accusations,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday.

He claimed that the footage of dead bodies in Bucha were ""fakes"" and said that Russia would push ahead with its call for a UN Security Council meeting over what it called ""Ukrainian provocations.""

Peskov also urged the international community not to draw any conclusions.

""The situation is undoubtedly serious and we would ask that many international leaders not rush with their statements, not rush with their baseless accusations, request information from different sources, and at least listen to our explanations.""

He did not say whether outrage over Bucha would hamper the talks planned for Monday between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators.

Spanish and Polish PMs denounce 'genocide'

The prime ministers of Spain and Poland have called the killings of civilians in the towns around Kyiv ""genocide.""

Polish leader Mateusz Morawiecki called for an international investigation into the claims made by Ukraine that Russian soldiers executed, raped and tortured civilians in the towns of Bucha and Irpin.

""These bloody massacres committed by Russians, by Russian soldiers, deserve to be called what they are. This is genocide and it must be judged,"" Morawiecki told reporters.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez also called for an investigation into Russian war crimes.

""We will do everything to ensure that those who have perpetrated these war crimes do not go unpunished, and therefore appear before the courts... to deal with these alleged cases of (crimes against) humanity, war crimes and why not say it too, genocide,"" he said.

EU considers urgent sanctions in wake of 'atrocities'

The European Union condemned the ""atrocities"" that have been reported in several towns that had been occupied by Russian forces and said it is planning on introducing new sanctions against Moscow.

The EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Monday that ""the Russian authorities are responsible for these atrocities, committed while they had effective control of the area. They are subject to the international law of occupation.""

He added that the ""haunting images of large numbers of civilian deaths and casualties, as well as destruction of civilian infrastructures show the true face of the brutal war of aggression Russia is waging against Ukraine and its people.""

As a result, the bloc ""will advance, as a matter of urgency, work on further sanctions against Russia.""

Red Cross: 'We've seen images of utter desolation and destruction'

Alyona Synenko, a Ukrainian working with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), spoke with DW about alleged atrocities committed by Russian soldiers in the Kyiv suburbs of Bucha and Irpin.

""The images that are circulating and that we saw are simply shocking. And it is at the core of the international humanitarian law that civilians and civilian infrastructure must be protected,"" she said of accusations that Moscow's troops had executed civilians and raped local women.

""If we don't work independently, we simply don't work because neutrality and independence are at the core principles of what we do that allow us to document violations of international humanitarian law and speak with warring parties to prevent those violations from happening,"" she said of the ICRC's need to work independently and in a non-partisan way.

""And this is what we are striving to do in Ukraine as well. Of course, the access has been extremely difficult to many places because of the heavy fighting, heavy shelling,"" she added.

Watch video 03:39 'People need just absolutely everything': ICRC

""We've seen images of utter desolation and destruction. Entire civilian neighborhoods are destroyed beyond repair. Streets are littered with unexploded remnants of war.

And unfortunately, right now it is impossible to send trucks.""

Ukraine renews calls for German embargo of Russian fuel

The Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, called on the German government to reconsider its stance on sanctions against Russian fossil fuels following the accusations of mass killings in areas formerly occupied by Russian forces.

He addressed the German government in a tweet, saying: ""I recommend you read these reports about raped and murdered children in Bucha and Irpin before you start explaining to us again why an immediate embargo on Russian gas, oil and coal isn't feasible.""

""How will Germany live with this?"" he added.

Number of bodies in Bucha reaches 330 — report

The Ukrainian newspaper Ukrayinska Pravda reported that the number of bodies found in the city of Bucha has risen to 330-340, citing a local funeral service.

A worker told the paper that they did not have complete lists of those allegedly killed by the Russian troops, adding that a search for further victims is ongoing.

France calls for fresh sanctions after Bucha killings

French President Emmanuel Macron said on Monday that he was in favor of introducing new sanctions against Russia after Ukraine said that Russian forces had carried out mass killings of civilians in areas around Kyiv.

Macron told French Inter radio that there were ""clear indications"" of Russian war crimes in Bucha. ""What happened in Bucha demands a new round of sanctions and very clear measures,"" he added.

He also called for the individuals responsible to be held accountable. ""International justice must take care of this and those who committed these crimes will have to answer for them,"" Macron said.

He joined other European officials in tabling again the possibility of imposing sanctions against Russian fossil fuel exports. The EU is broadly dependent on Russian oil and gas while the Russian economy is dependent on its fossil fuel exports.

UK intelligence notes Russian consolidation in Donbas

Monday's intelligence update from the UK's Ministry of Defence stated that Russia is consolidating its position in the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine — parts of which have been under the control of Russian-backed separatists since 2014.

The update also said that further Russian forces, as well as the soldiers from the Wagner mercenary group with links to Moscow, were being deployed in the eastern region.

US condemns 'atrocities' in Bucha

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington strongly condemns the killings of civilians in Bucha and other areas across Ukraine.

In a statement posted to Twitter, Blinken described the killings as ""apparent atrocities"" that were committed by ""Kremlin forces.""

""We are pursuing accountability using every tool available, documenting and sharing information to hold accountable those responsible,"" the top US diplomat said.

Dutch journalist deported from Ukraine

Dutch journalist Robert Dulmers was expelled from Ukraine after posting a video of a Russian missile attack on an oil refinery and fuel storage facility in Odesa.

He said Ukrainian authorities told him he revealed state secrets by posting images of the Russian missile impact in the key port city.

Dulmers has been reporting from Ukraine for the Nederlands Dagblad newspaper since the start of the war.

After being detained by unidentified operatives, he was driven to the Moldovan border and was told he was banned from entering Ukraine for ten years.

The Dutch Journalists' Association NVJ appealed to Ukrainian authorities to reconsider the decision, Dutch public broadcaster NOS reported

Zelenskyy creates agency to investigate and prosecute Russian war crimes

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy fears that ""more terrible things could unfold"" and ""even more deaths and abuses"" could emerge from Ukrainian regions still under Russian control.

""Hundreds of people were killed. Tortured, executed civilians. Corpses on the street,"" he said in a Sunday evening video message.

Zelenskyy accused Russians of committing atrocities against unarmed civilians in Bucha and other Ukrainian cities.

The Ukrainian leader also announced the creation of a special agency to investigate and litigate crimes committed by Russian forces.

""There is a common responsibility. For these killings, for this torture, for arms blown off by blasts... For the shots in the back of the head,"" Zelenskyy added.

Images from Bucha near Kyiv, where civilian corpses were found on the streets and mass graves were found after Russia's withdrawal, have prompted international outrage.

A mass grave has been discovered in the town of Bucha

Zelensky also took aim at former German Chancellor Angela Merkel and France's former President Nicolas Sarkozy, claiming their Russia policy contributed to the current crisis.

Satellite image shows mass grave site in Bucha

New satellite imagery of Bucha revealed a 45-foot (13.71 meter) trench at a site where a mass grave has been identified, a US satellite data firm says.

The pictures from Maxar Technologies showed trench dug into the grounds of the Church of St. Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints.

The images were captured on 31 March, but the company said the first signs of excavation for a mass grave were seen on March 10.

Bodies were first buried in the grave on the church grounds in the first days of the war, residents told CNN.

Ukraine accused Russian forces of carrying out a ""massacre"" in the town on the outskirts of Kyiv.

Russia requested the UN Security Council to convene to discuss the accusations.

Russia's defense ministry has rejected the reports.

The expulsion order applies to 4o members of the Russian embassy's diplomatic staff who have been linked to Russia's intelligence services, Süddeutsche Zeitung reported.

The announcement by foreign minister Annalena Baerbock follows similar moves by European partners in recent days as a reaction to Russia’s war on its neighbour Ukraine.

Also, France has said it would expel some Russian diplomats as part of a joint European action after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

“France decided this evening to expel a number of Russian personnel with diplomatic status stationed in France whose activities are against our security interests,” the foreign ministry said in a statement.

A French ministry source, who asked not to be named, according to AFP news agency, said 35 Russian diplomats would be expelled. Earlier on Monday, Lithuania expelled its Russian ambassador.

Ms Baerbock said Germany’s move was a response to the “unbelievable brutality” the Kremlin had unleashed in Ukraine.

“The images from Bucha speak to unbelievable brutality by the Russian leadership and by those who follow its propaganda with a boundless will to exterminate,” Ms Baerbock said, referring to the town near Kyiv where dozens of bodies were found in mass graves or littering the streets following the withdrawal of Russian forces.

Russia’s foreign ministry said it will respond to Germany’s decision to expel 40 Russian diplomats, the Interfax news agency reported.

The Kremlin has denied Western allegations that Russian forces were responsible for killing civilians in Bucha.

“This information must be seriously questioned,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. “From what we have seen, our experts have identified signs of video falsification and other fakes.”

The Bucha Killings

Russia has been accused of a deliberate massacre in Bucha, a town near Kyiv where dozens of bodies were found in mass graves or littering the streets following the withdrawal of Russian forces.

Bucha had been under Russia’s siege until Ukraine reclaimed the city around March 30, 2022.

Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba accused Russia of carrying out a deliberate “massacre” in the town calling on the G7 to impose “devastating” new sanctions on Moscow.

However, Ms Baerbock said “similar images” could be found “in other places that Russian troops have occupied.”

She said it was essential to “stand up for our freedom and be prepared to defend it.”

“That is why the German government has decided to declare a significant number of staff of the Russian embassy, who have worked every day here in Germany against our freedom, against the cohesion of our society, as persona non grata,” she said.

She described the diplomats’ presence “as a threat” to the more than 300,000 Ukrainians who have sought protection in Germany since the invasion began.

“We will no longer tolerate that, we communicated that to the Russian ambassador this afternoon,” she said.

Ms Baerbock said Germany would take further steps “with our partners” including “imposing harsher sanctions on Russia, decisively expanding support for Ukraine’s fighting forces and bolstering NATO’s eastern flank.”

Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Monday the evidence of civilian killings from Bucha was just the “tip of the iceberg” and showed the need for tougher sanctions on Moscow.

“Half measures are not enough anymore. I demand most severe sanctions this week, this is the plea of the victims of the rapes and killings. If you have doubts about sanctions go to Bucha first,” he said during a press conference with British foreign minister Liz Truss.

Russia’s February 24 invasion has left thousands of people dead, according to Ukrainian authorities, and forced more than 4 million Ukrainians to flee the country.

President Vladimir Putin of Russia has said the attack is aimed at eliminating a security threat and has demanded that Ukraine drop its bid to join NATO, which Kyiv is now considering.

U.S. stops Russian bond payment

The United States has stopped the Russian government from paying holders of its sovereign debt more than $600 million from reserves held at American banks, Al Jazeera is reporting.

This is a move meant to ratchet up pressure on Moscow and eat into its holdings of U.S. dollars.

Although the economic sanctions earlier placed on Russia after it attacked Ukraine, froze its foreign currency reserves held in U.S. financial institutions, the U.S. Department of Treasury had been allowing the Russian government to use those funds to make coupon payments on dollar-denominated sovereign debt on a case-by-case basis.

On Monday, the largest of the payments came due, including a $552.4 million principal payment on a maturing bond. The U.S. government decided to cut off Moscow’s access to the frozen funds, according to a U.S. Treasury spokesperson.

An $84 million coupon payment was also due on Monday on a 2042 sovereign dollar bond.

The move was meant to force Moscow to make the difficult decision of whether it would use dollars that it has access to for payments on its debt or for other purposes, including supporting its war effort, the spokesperson said.

“Russia must choose between draining remaining valuable dollar reserves or new revenue coming in, or default,” the spokesperson said.

U.S., UK call for suspension of Russia from UN Rights Council

The United States says it plans to ask the UN General Assembly to suspend Russia from the Human Rights Council, Al Jazeera is reporting.

The request by U.S. Ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, on a visit to Romania, comes after Ukraine accused Russian troops of killing dozens of civilians in the town of Bucha.

“Russia’s participation on the Human Rights Council is a farce,” Ms Thomas-Greenfield said.

“And it is wrong, which is why we believe it is time the UN General Assembly voted to remove them.”

A two-thirds majority vote by the 193-member assembly in New York can suspend a state for persistently committing gross and systematic violations of human rights.

Ms Thomas-Greenfield said she wants to have the vote this week.

The United Kingdom has backed Washington’s effort to suspend Russia from the UN Human Rights Council over the killings in Ukraine’s Bucha.

“Given strong evidence of war crimes, including reports of mass graves and heinous butchery in Bucha, Russia cannot remain a member of the UN Human Rights Council. Russia must be suspended,” Al Jazeera quoted British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss as saying.

Responding to the call for its suspension, Russia’s Ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, said, “what the West is trying to do with Russia, trying to exclude it from multilateral forums we are having in the world … this is unprecedented.”

“This is unbelievable,” he said. Adding that “this will not facilitate or encourage or be helpful to what is happening between Russian and Ukrainians in peace talks,” he added.

She was speaking alongside the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, in Warsaw, where the two discussed how to step up sanctions against Russia to the maximum in the wake of the alleged war crimes revealed in Bucha.

She said: “There should be no talk of removing sanctions, while Putin’s troops are in Ukraine, and the threat of Russian aggression looms over Europe. We need to see Putin withdraw his troops. We need to see Ukraine’s full territorial integrity restored. We need to see Russia’s ability for further aggression stopped.”

She said the sanctions had already set back Russia’s economy by 15 years, but now it was necessary to go to the maximum level of sanctions since the worst in terms of atrocities had already happened.

She said she believed Vladimir Putin only responded to force, adding the UK intends to press for a timetable to end western dependency on Russian energy to be agreed at a meeting of G7 foreign ministers to be attended by Germany and Italy, two of the countries most dependent on Russian energy.

Kuleba urged any foreign minister thinking of voting against such an embargo to come first to visit the mass graves in Ukraine, adding half measures are no longer enough. He said he feared the bodies discovered in Bucha were just the tip of the iceberg and worse horrors will be uncovered when the siege of Mariupol is lifted.

“I can tell you without an exaggeration, but with great sorrow, that the situation in Mariupol is much worse compared to what we’ve seen in Bucha and others cities, towns and villages near Kyiv,” he said.

At a press conference after their meeting Truss announced an extra £10m in UK funding to help victims of sexual violence in the conflict, as well as technical advice including from the Metropolitan police to help Ukraine gather evidence of war crimes.

She said: “I am afraid it is not the end of the atrocities, and we should simply not be doing business with Putin.

“We have seen butchery, evidence of rape and sexual violence, as well as the indiscriminate killing of civilians. We will ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice for these barbaric crimes. And, together with our allies, we will step up our efforts to stop Putin’s appalling war.”

Although she said it is very clear that war crimes have taken place, she said it was for the courts to decide if this amounted to genocide, the claim already made by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

Both ministers joined the US call for Russia to be expelled from the UN Human Rights Council.

Calling for a tough new wave of sanctions, Truss said: “The reality is that money is still flowing from the west into Putin’s war machine. That has to stop.”

She called for a ban on Russian ships in European ports, closure of Russian banks’ access to international payment systems, a clampdown on Russian gold sales by the Russian central bank as well as the timetable to end dependency on Russian energy.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/04/sanctions-on-russia-must-stay-till-all-troops-leave-ukraine-says-liz-truss

Well, one of the main things that they will be talking about is the presence of Dmytro Kuleba, the foreign minister of Ukraine.

He's expected to be here early tomorrow, will receive a warm welcome from Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, will have many meetings with his foreign minister counterparts who are here in Brussels. He will also hold a press conference.

And that is a rare thing, for NATO to be willing to give the mic over to a nonmember. And he's expected to call for more, call for an E.U. ban on Russian ships accessing European ports, also ban on Russian trucks, and, of course, a gas and oil embargo, a demand that President Zelenskyy in Kyiv just a few minutes ago repeated.

He will also attend an interesting meeting, Judy. He will address not only NATO's 30 members, but other non-NATO members, including four Asian allies and Finland and Sweden. Those are two Northern European countries that are not in NATO, but are currently having historic conversations about whether they will join NATO in the coming months.

Finally, the foreign ministers will also talk about how to deter Russia in the short term, and that means really new battle groups, new soldiers, more forces sent to Southeastern Europe. This is a place, Judy, around the Black Sea along Ukraine's borders that NATO hasn't really been focusing on. At least, it wasn't before the Russian invasion.",https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/western-nations-impose-new-sanctions-on-russia-in-response-to-atrocities-in-ukraine
