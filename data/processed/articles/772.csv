Due to the outage on Wednesday, on site emergency diesel generators were turned on to provide power systems important for safety, the company said in a Facebook post.

Ukrenergo added that the supply of diesel fuel on diesel generators will be enough for 48 hours.

According to the company, repair work to restore the energy supply was impossible due to Russian combat operations in the region.

Although operations stopped at the plant after the catastrophic nuclear disaster in 1986, Chernobyl was never fully abandoned and still requires constant management, the BBC said, adding that spent nuclear fuel is cooled at the site.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on Thursday morning confirmed the power outage at Chernobyl, saying that it “would not have a critical impact on essential safety functions at the site”.

IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi however, said that the outage was likely to create additional stress for around 210 technical experts and guards currently stuck at the site since Russia began its war on February 24.

Speaking to the BBC, Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko, said the stranded staff would now be “mentally exhausted”, adding that protecting Ukraine`s nuclear plants should be a priority “for the EU, the world, and not just for Ukraine”.

Galushchenko said that the Ukrainian authorities wanted to restore the power supply as quickly as possible.

Slavutych town, where most of Chernobyl`s workers live, is also without electricity, Mayor Yuri Fomichev told the BBC.

He added that the power outage could lead to the entire town losing water and heating within hours.

The decision will affect customers in the Russian Federation as well as those in Belarus, an ally of Moscow, backing its military operation.

Western Union Condemns Invasion of Ukraine, Halts Services in Russia and Belarus

Money transfer specialist Western Union has condemned Russia’s military assault on neighboring Ukraine, expressing “shock, disbelief, and sadness around this tragedy and humanitarian disaster.” The company has been working to support its Ukrainian clients, including through donations, humanitarian relief efforts, and by waiving fees.

The cross-border payments provider announced its decision to suspend operations in the Russian Federation and Belarus, taken after discussing the matter with various stakeholders. The company added it had also evaluated the consequences for its partners, and customers. In a statement released Thursday, it also emphasized:

We join the international community in expressing sincere hope for a diplomatic and peaceful resolution. Meanwhile, our priorities remain the well-being and safety of our employees as well as continuing to support the people of Ukraine, including the growing number of refugees seeking safety.

Western Union, also a global leader in cross-currency money movement with a presence in over 200 countries and territories, is the latest in a group of payment and remittance providers that have suspended services in Russia as part of sanctions over the war in Ukraine. These include Paypal, Wise, Remitly, Transfergo, Zepz, and Revolut.

Visa and Mastercard, the world’s leading payment processors, also backed western sanctions against Moscow, suspending operations in the Russian Federation, although Russian residents will be able to use their locally issued cards inside the country. American Express introduced identical measures.

Ukraine has been calling for and welcoming such moves. The authorities in Kyiv also urged cryptocurrency exchanges to freeze Russian accounts but major trading platforms like Binance and Kraken have denied the request to unilaterally impose restrictions on all Russian users.

At the same time, the Ukrainian government and volunteer organizations have been increasingly relying on donated cryptocurrency to fund defense efforts and solve humanitarian problems. Ukraine has received significant support from representatives of the crypto industry and community.

You can support Ukrainian families, children, refugees, and displaced people by donating BTC, ETH, and BNB to Binance Charity’s Ukraine Emergency Relief Fund.
