KYIV, Ukraine – Yuri Shuklin has never fired a gun, not a real one at least. His war experience, he said, comes from playing video games such as “Call to Action.” “Maybe it’s funny, but in some movies and video games, they have nice [battlefield] tactics,” he said. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight By Saturday, he had signed up to fight the Russian forces pressing on this capital.

In Ukraine, there’s precedent for Shuklin’s screen-to-reality sense of confidence: President Volodymyr Zelensky was an actor and comedian, whose only political experience before getting elected was playing the role of Ukraine’s president in a satirical TV series. Now, those savvy communication skills, his ability to sway audiences via social media, a healthy dose of grit and defiance — and not least of all, his readiness to die if necessary — have transformed him into an unlikely champion for Ukrainians and the world.

Shuklin, who once never cared about politics, is among Zelensky’s devotees.

“This man did not jump away to some other country like previous presidents,” said the tall and lean 31-year-old mechanic. “He can show us the way.”

Until three days ago, when the Russians invaded, Zelensky’s political tenure was mixed, even considered by many on the decline. He was criticized for not pushing forward essential anti-corruption and judicial reforms. Ukrainians felt he was weak in his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin and too quick to seek compromise with Moscow.

Zelensky, 44, at times downplayed the threat of Russia crossing into Ukraine and at others warned of Russia seizing Ukrainian cities. He denounced the United States and European governments as alarmist in their repeated warnings of an impending assault. There was no meaningful effort to bolster defenses along Ukraine’s border with Russia. Nor was there preparation for evacuations and other contingencies to protect Ukrainians.

As a wartime president, however, Zelensky has risen remarkably to the challenge. His messaging has been consistent and sharply directed at Moscow. In videos posted on social media he has appealed directly to Russian citizens, gracefully urging them to protest Putin’s onslaught on Ukrainian democracy.

In another video, wearing a green military-style pullover, he called for Ukrainians to take up arms. “We are alone in defending our state. Who else wants to fight with us? Honestly, I don’t see anyone,” he said.

He has portrayed himself as the primary target of Moscow, describing himself as “target number one” and declaring that Putin wants to “destroy Ukraine by destroying the head of state.”

“I’ve always thought he is a person who has a profound sense of right and wrong,” said a senior adviser to Zelensky, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly. “He will never acquiesce when he thinks something is wrong.”

“Right now, he’s very focused. He’s very driven. He thinks Ukraine can prevail if everyone takes the same stand he is taking.” Asked if Zelensky was prepared to die fighting, the adviser answered without hesitation: “Yes.”

Zelensky has also astutely used imagery to his advantage. Instead of hiding in a shelter, he has shown himself walking in Kyiv or visiting with soldiers, wearing a bulletproof jacket. Virtually every day, a new video emerges on social media showing his defiance of Russia.

“For all the talk of Russian information warfare, Zelensky had proven to be a master communicator,” Colin Clarke, director of research at The Soufan Group, an intelligence and security consultancy, said in a tweet. “His messages have conveyed strength, empathy & fortitude. A case study in effective communication during war and a profile of courage on a level I can’t recall.”

“Zelensky is becoming as much of an internationally recognized hero as Putin is a global pariah. The contrast could not be more stark,” Clarke added in a subsequent tweet.

Zelensky has been unshakable diplomatically, refusing Western demands to set aside Ukraine’s aspirations to join NATO, a key goal of Putin. But most Ukrainians have been impressed by an action Zelensky has not taken: He and his family haven’t fled the country, despite the threats to their lives.

That is unlike one of his predecessors, Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Russia after being ousted following Ukraine’s 2014 revolution and was tried in absentia.

On Friday, after the United States offered to transport him to a safe place, Zelensky retorted: “I need ammunition, not a ride.”

It’s not just Ukrainians who are impressed by Zelensky’s actions. Afghans on social media have applauded his decision to stay, bitterly noting that their former president Ashraf Ghani fled the country as the Taliban reached the capital Kabul last August.

“The war has transformed the former comedian from a provincial politician with delusions of grandeur into a bona fide statesman,” Melinda Haring, deputy director of the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center, wrote in Foreign Affairs on Friday. “Grave as Zelensky’s failure to reform Ukraine may be, in the midst of Putin’s intransigence and aggression, the president has shown a stiff upper lip.”

On Friday, Ukrainians who have joined the campaign to fight the Russians expressed a sense of solidarity with their president.

Down several flights of stairs under a small business in Kyiv, groups of Ukrainians, young and old, sat hunched over piles of glass bottles, carefully filling each one with styrofoam and fuel to help transform it into a molotov cocktail, or petrol bomb.

Among them was Valerii Valiiev, 17, a college student who left his dormitory earlier this past week and has joined the war effort by contributing to the molotov production. He hopes that even if they can’t cause significant damage to a Russian tank, they will at least block the tank crews’ vision and harm their breathing.

Several hundred have already been crafted in this bunker alone, he said.

Helping assemble these weapons is part of how Valiiev, a law student, is contributing to the battle for Ukraine, which he said has unified civilians of all backgrounds behind Zelensky.

Before the war, Valiiev wasn’t the president’s biggest fan, worrying about corruption and who he perceived as some pro-Russian appointees.

“But today he is the hero,” he said of Zelensky, describing him as the pride of the nation. He appeared weak before, Valiiev said. “But now he is strong.”

Shortly after taking shelter in a bunker early Saturday morning, Nazar Cherniha, 34, heard an enormous boom and screaming from outside. When he emerged from safety later, he saw that an enormous chunk of the apartment building across the street was missing. A missile had struck the building, ripping the walls off multiple apartments in the upper half of the high-rise and injuring many civilians inside.

The incident left Cherniha enraged and ready to “struggle with my hands” against the Russians, he said. “After tonight I am not scared anymore. Fear disappeared.”

Before the war, Cherniha was “not a fan” of Zelensky, he said. But now he is rallying behind him. His videos proving he is still in the capital are “a very good sign we are all together.”

Zelensky made the right choice when he decided “to be in Kyiv to stay with us and to fight for our country,” he said.

On the ground near the site of the strike, decades-old family photos were scattered on the ground. A child’s scooter sat crumpled by the sidewalk. One man knelt in the middle of the street, slowly cleaning up the debris as cars drove around him.

“I did have a lot of questions about Zelensky before, but now I can say nothing bad about him,” said Nataliya Cherniha, 61, his mother, staring at the debris. “The people have really come together, and such a unity can’t possibly be defeated.”

Volodymyr Zelenskyy is leading his country during an invasion that threatens to explode into the worst conflict in Europe’s post-World War II history.

On Friday, as Russian troops reached Kyiv, he posted a defiant handheld video to social media showing him next to the presidential palace in the heart of the Ukrainian capital, surrounded by members of his Cabinet.

“We are all here,” he said. “We are defending our independence, our country.”

The message capped a head-spinning transformation of a man whose job used to be making jokes on television into a wartime leader. Who is this man at the helm as Ukraine faces the gravest of challenges?

Zelenskyy, 44, who was elected president in 2019, was educated as a lawyer, but found his true calling as an entertainer.

Married to Olena Zelenska, with whom he has two children, he was born in the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih in the then-Soviet Union to Jewish parents.

His family’s story tracks his homeland’s and the continent’s bloody history: He has said three of his grandfather’s brothers were killed by Nazi occupiers, while his grandfather survived WWII.

Raised during communism, Zelenskyy went into politics months before the 2019 election with no prior experience or solid policies. Instead, he ran on a promise to inject integrity into his country’s leadership.

Unlike many of his counterparts in the region, his past did not turn him into a dour politician in the Soviet mold. On the contrary, his public persona is encapsulated by one of his best-known quips: “You don’t need experience to be president. You just need to be a decent human being.”

As a product of the entertainment industry, he is known for his personable style and his ability to speak to people of all kinds.

“He is quite empathetic as a person. He finds good connections with people,” said Orysia Lutsevych, a research fellow at the London think tank Chatham House. “That’s why he’s successful in politics.”

A native Russian speaker, Zelenskyy used his charisma and immense popularity to win a landslide victory, supported by voters in Ukraine’s south and east — where millions of Russian-speaking Ukrainians felt disenfranchised by previous administrations. It is this alienation that Russia has tried to capitalize on by supporting separatists who have been fighting Ukrainian forces for eight years.

This week’s invasion, which came after months of Russia massing troops on Ukraine’s borders and demands from President Vladimir Putin that NATO bar Ukraine from joining the military alliance, is not the first time Zelenskyy has been thrust into the spotlight.

Just months into his presidency, a phone conversation in which then-President Donald Trump pressed him to investigate corruption allegations against Joe Biden garnered international attention. The scandal led to the first impeachment of Trump, who was acquitted in early 2020.

By this time, Zelenskyy had already disrupted the Ukrainian political system, bringing into the government people who wanted to modernize the country, Lutsevych said.

He tried to rein in Ukraine’s rampant corruption and disrupt the existing pillars of power, but “didn’t muster enough political power to crack the bone of Ukrainian corruption within the system,” she added.

At the same time, he’s been praised by many in Ukraine for keeping the country of 44 million firmly on a pro-Western path. Russia and Ukraine stayed aligned after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, but began drifting apart in the 2000s as Kyiv sought deeper integration with Europe.

In 2014, pro-Kremlin President Viktor Yanukovych was swept from power after refusing to sign an association agreement with the European Union.

The mere fact that Ukraine is a democracy has been threatening to the Kremlin, and Russian officials accuse Zelenskyy of being a Western “marionette.” He is often mocked by the Kremlin’s propagandists as being incapable.

Zelenskyy has also been criticized for not delivering on his biggest campaign promise — to end the long-simmering war between government forces and the Moscow-backed separatists in Ukraine’s east. The conflict that has left 14,000 dead became a flashpoint last week after Russia officially recognized the breakaway territories, Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic. The move paved the way for the invasion days later.

While rallying support for Ukraine as tensions rose in the run-up to the invasion, Zelenskyy chose to play down dire warnings coming out of Washington that Moscow was about to attack, saying it was hurting Ukraine’s already fragile economy and morale.

He spooked the markets and sent the foreign media into a frenzy earlier this month when — in his characteristically sarcastic style — he appeared to say in a speech that Russia would attack on Feb. 16, later clarifying he was only referring to media reports of an invasion on this date.

Many questioned his calm tone as being too relaxed, even making him the butt of a joke for American late night show hosts.

But as it became clear last week, Ukraine was running out of diplomatic options to appease Putin, and while Zelenskyy still preached calm, he took on a more serious tone. He insisted Ukraine was ready for any threat while calling for peace.

Assessing Zelenskyy’s performance in the lead-up to the invasion and as commander in chief, Valentyn Gladkykh, a Kyiv-based political analyst, told NBC News that the Ukrainian president had managed to morph into a wartime leader and, for now, Ukrainian society, including his peacetime opponents, seem to be supporting him.

“No Ukrainian president has ever dealt with a full-on invasion on his territory,” Gladkykh said. “Having encountered the unprecedented threat, Zelenskyy has shown his best side.”

But his best side may not be enough — he and Ukraine are trapped in a true David and Goliath contest. Vast nuclear-powered Russia spans 11 time zones and its army counts as one of the largest in the world, leaving the army of Texas-size Ukraine outnumbered and outgunned.

The contrast isn’t only down to size and military might. Within hours of Russia’s first strikes, the difference between Zelenskyy and his counterpart in the Kremlin could not have been more stark.

In his address to justify an incursion into Ukraine late Wednesday, a typically expressionless Putin spoke in his stern ex-KGB officer tone, invoking Russia’s nuclear arsenal and warning anyone who tries to stop him.

“No one should have any doubts that a direct attack on our country will lead to defeat and dire consequences for any potential aggressor,” he said.

A few hours earlier, a visibly exhausted Zelenskyy delivered an impassioned, last-minute plea for peace, appealing to Russian citizens directly — in Russian.

“The people of Ukraine want peace,” he said, warning about the devastation that the war would bring to both people.

“If the Russian leaders don’t want to sit with us behind the table for the sake of peace, maybe they will sit behind the table with you,” Zelenskyy pleaded. “Do Russians want war? I would like to know the answer. But the answer depends only on you.”

Even as Putin’s bombs started falling on Ukrainian soil, Zelenskyy urged Russians to speak up against the war. He thanked those who did Friday, saying “keep fighting for us.”

There is widespread speculation among observers that Putin’s endgame in Ukraine might be to topple Zelenskyy and to install a president more willing to bend before Moscow. Last month, ​​Britain said the Kremlin was seeking to install a pro-Russian leader in Ukraine as part of its plans for an invasion.

“They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying its head of state,” Zelenskyy said Thursday, saying he was now “target No. 1” for the Russian forces, but vowed to remain in the capital.

Later Friday, Putin urged Ukrainian soldiers to overthrow their government, even as he suggested he might be willing to enter talks while his forces continued their advance across the country.

But Zelenskyy is left with few options as the Russian offensive intensifies. He could concede ground to Moscow, a move that is likely to be unpopular with many Ukrainians, or hold his position and face the full wrath of the Russian army.

For now, he remains defiant.

“It will continue like this,” he said in the video posted Friday. “Glory to our defenders, glory to Ukraine.”",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/zelenskyy-ukraine-russia-putin-invasion-rcna17661

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy came to power in 2019, taking charge of the war-torn, corruption-plagued country of about 45 million without any prior political experience.

The political novice and former sitcom actor and comedian, who was dismissed by critics as a puppet of Ukrainian oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky, won his presidency by securing more than 73 percent of ballots, promising to balance the defence of Ukraine from Russian aggression with protecting the Russian speakers of his country.

Born in the predominantly Russian-speaking industrial city of Kryvyi Rih in central Ukraine, the father of two was seen as best placed to succeed in his mission and shortly after becoming president, used diplomacy to get Moscow to exchange several groups of Ukrainian prisoners of war.

But the goodwill of Russia’s President Vladimir Putin was not to last, as Zelenskyy did not change his country’s pro-Western foreign policy in favour of closer ties to its former master, Moscow.

Last year, Russia started amassing its troops near Ukraine’s borders with a pretext of holding military exercises.

Despite warnings by the United States of the Russian plan to invade Ukraine, Zelenskyy tried to keep calm in the country, calling on Ukrainians to avoid panic.

However, he shuttled around the capitals of Europe, trying to secure diplomatic, military and financial support for Ukraine to deter Moscow from invading.

On Thursday, February 24, Zelenskyy became Europe’s most vulnerable president, as Russia launched an all-out invasion of Ukraine by land, air and sea.

‘A regime change’

Fabrice Pothier, a chief strategy officer at the political consultancy Rasmussen Global and former director of policy planning at NATO, told Al Jazeera from Santander, Spain that Putin’s aim was “political capitulation” – “a regime change” in Ukraine.

“It is pretty clear that he wants a regime change and the regime should be – in his view – sympathetic to Russia’s interest, turning down the NATO and the EU membership path, claiming some kind of neutrality or a Finland position,” he said, referring to Finland’s historic decision to associate with Europe, but avoid hostility towards Russia by not joining NATO.

Zelenskyy also identified himself as “target number one” of Russia, but he and his family remained in Ukraine.

“They want to destroy Ukraine politically by taking down the head of state,” the president said.

The 44-year-old also criticised Ukraine’s allies for not coming to his country’s defence physically, limiting themselves with verbal, financial and diplomatic support.

“We have been left alone to defend our state,” he said in a video address to the nation after midnight. “Who is ready to fight alongside us? I don’t see anyone. Who is ready to give Ukraine a guarantee of NATO membership? Everyone is afraid.”
