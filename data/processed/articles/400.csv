Today, bombardment and assault aviation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine fired missiles at six columns of military equipment of the Russian aggressor.

""This day was quite difficult for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The occupiers continue shelling in almost all directions of the front line. The Air Force opposes the aggressor both in sky and on earth. The aviation garrison in Vasylkiv heroically defends itself, withstanding massive shelling and enemy attacks. Air Force officers bravely repel the aggressor in other cities and military garrisons. Today, bombardment and assault aviation fired missiles at six columns of military equipment of the occupiers,"" the press service of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine posted on Facebook.

As noted, Su-25 attack aircraft in pairs and units attacked and destroyed columns of enemy vehicles in Kherson and Chernihiv regions. Bombardment aviation continued the combat missions of attack aircraft to hit ground targets. Su-24M destroyed columns of enemy vehicles in Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Chernihiv and Zaporizhzhia regions.

In addition, Ukrainian antiaircraft missile troops shot down enemy Ka-52 helicopters and Orlan-10 drone. The crew of Bayraktar TB2 unmanned combat aerial vehicle worked brilliantly once again, striking the Buk-M1 column with a corrected aviation bomb.

Russian president Vladimir Putin declared war on Ukraine on February 24 and launched a large-scale invasion. For the fourth day already, Russian troops have been shelling and destroying key infrastructure. Missiles hit residential buildings.

Martial law was imposed in Ukraine and general mobilization was announced.

According to the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Russia lost 4,300 servicemen over the three days of the war.

Ukraine officially filed a lawsuit against the Russian Federation at the UN International Court of Justice in The Hague.

2,efe57bf2-f5c4-46d8-aff3-21ae5b2b1de7,[],,"WASHINGTON — Russia’s drive to seize control of Ukraine quickly has lost momentum amid resistance from Ukrainian fighters on the ground and in the air, a senior US defense official said Friday.

“Their momentum, particularly as it comes to Kyiv, has slowed over the last 24 hours,” the official said.

Russian forces, which entered Ukraine early Thursday, have yet to seize any major cities, or gain control of airspace, the official said.

“They have not achieved the progress that we believe they anticipated they would,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

“A good indicator of that is no population centers have been taken. None,” the official said.

The Pentagon believes that Moscow wants to seize control of Kyiv and replace the Western-leaning government with allies of the Kremlin.

And many worry that the powerful Russian force, with massive backup still awaiting on Ukraine’s border, could conquer Kyiv within days.

But so far, while Russian forces have focused on military targets, they have not been able to disrupt the Ukrainian military structure.

“As we see it right now… Ukrainian command and control is intact,” the official said.

Nor have they been able to command air space. The Pentagon says that Ukrainian air defense systems are still working and the country’s air force is still able to fly and threaten Russian aircraft.

“They’re meeting more resistance than they expected,” the official said.

“We continue to have indications that it’s not going quite the way that they had anticipated.”

Starting with a massive missile barrage, Russia launched its invasion along three axes: the first a push from Belarus directly north toward Kyiv; the second from Russia’s Belgorod region toward the major city of Kharkiv in northeast Ukraine; and the third, from Crimea in the south towards Kherson.

While Russian forces have reached the outskirts of Kyiv, they have not been able to enter, and fighting remains heavy around Kharkiv, which also has not fallen.

In the south, Russians continue to push to Kherson but are also widening the front, landing amphibious forces to Crimea’s east to threaten Mariupol.

Russians have also sought to take control of the Kakhovka hydroelectric plant on the Dnieper river north of Crimea, launching cyberattacks on the plant, the official said.

The Pentagon would not estimate how many Russian forces had entered Ukraine, after having amassed more than 150,000 along the country’s borders before attacking.

The official said that they had moved “about a third of their combat power” into Ukraine, and the rest remain in place just outside.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-says-russian-forces-lose-momentum-to-stiff-ukraine-resistance/

February 25, 3:00 pm EST

Russian forces entered major Ukrainian cities—including Kyiv and Kherson—for the first time on February 25. Russian forces’ main axes of advance focused on Kyiv (successfully isolating the city on both banks of the Dnipro River). Russian military operations along Ukraine’s northern border have been less well-planned, organized, and conducted than those emanating from Crimea. They have also been less successful so far. The divergence in performance likely arises in part from differences in the composition and organization of the Russian ground forces elements in the Western Military District and Belarus (to Ukraine’s north) and Southern Military District and Black Sea Fleet (to its south and east), as ISW has previously observed.[1] Determined and well-organized Ukrainian resistance around Kyiv and Kharkiv has also played an important role in preventing the Russian military from advancing with the speed and success for which it had reportedly planned.[2] The Russian military has deployed additional forces to southeastern Belarus, likely beyond those Moscow had planned to use against Ukraine, to offset these problems and challenges. Russian forces remain much larger and more capable than Ukraine’s conventional military, however. Russia will likely defeat Ukrainian regular military forces and secure their territorial objectives at some point in the coming days or weeks if Putin is determined to do so and willing to pay the cost in blood and treasure.

Key Takeaways

Russian forces entered the outskirts of Kyiv on the west bank of the Dnipro on February 25. Russian sabotage groups in civilian clothes are reportedly active in downtown Kyiv.

Russian forces have so far failed to enter Kyiv’s eastern outskirts. Ukrainian forces have successfully slowed Russian troops, which have temporarily abandoned the failed attempt to take the city of Chernihiv and are instead bypassing it.

Elements of the Russian 76th VDV (Airborne) division have concentrated in southeastern Belarus likely for use along the Chernihiv-bypass axis toward Kyiv in the next 24 hours.

Russian forces will likely envelop Kharkhiv in the next 24 hours after failing to enter the city through frontal assaults on February 24.

Russian forces have achieved little success on frontal assaults or envelopments against Ukrainian forces in Donbas but may not have intended to do more than pin Ukrainian forces in the east.

North of Crimea, Russian forces fully captured Kherson and are likely on the verge of seizing Melitopol in the east. Unconfirmed reports indicate that Russian forces had bypassed Kherson earlier and headed directly for Mykolaiv and Odessa.

Russian forces may be assembling in Stolin, Belarus, to open a new line of advance against Rivne in western Ukraine.

Russian forces carried out additional air and missile strikes on Kyiv and other major cities around 3:00 am local time on February 25. ISW cannot confirm the frequency and targets of overnight Russian strikes at this time. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian forces are increasingly targeting civil infrastructure and residential buildings “to intimidate the population of Ukraine.”[3] Russian forces continue to refrain from using the likely full scale of Russian air and missile capabilities, likely seeking to limit the negative imagery of heavy Ukrainian civilian casualties. However, Russian forces will likely increase their use of bombardments in coming days to overcome heavier-than-anticipated Ukrainian resistance.

Russian ground forces are advancing on four primary axes, discussed in turn below:

Belarus/Kyiv; Kharkiv; Donbas; and Crimea-Kherson.

1) Belarus/Kyiv axis: Russian forces entered the outskirts of Kyiv on the west bank of the Dnipro on February 25. Russian forces have so far failed to enter Kyiv’s eastern outskirts. They have abandoned for now the failed attempt to take the city of Chernihiv and are instead bypassing it. Elements of the 76thVDV (Airborne) division have concentrated in southeastern Belarus likely for use along the Chernihiv-bypass axis toward Kyiv in the next 24 hours.

Russian forces entered the northwest Kyiv suburb of Obolon, on the western bank of the Dnipro River, as of 11:00 am local time. [4] The Ukrainian General Staff asked residents of Obolon to shelter in place and make Molotov cocktails the morning of February 25. [5] The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed at 3:30 pm local time on February 25 that Russian forces had isolated Kyiv from the west. [6]

The Ukrainian General Staff asked residents of Obolon to shelter in place and make Molotov cocktails the morning of February 25. The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed at 3:30 pm local time on February 25 that Russian forces had isolated Kyiv from the west. Russian forces bypassed the city of Chernihiv on the eastern approach to Kyiv after being halted by Ukrainian forces much of February 24-25. [7] The UK Defense Ministry reported at 6:00 pm local time that Russian forces opened a “new route” to Kyiv after failing to capture Chernihiv. [8] Russian forces have not yet entered Kyiv’s eastern outskirts.

The UK Defense Ministry reported at 6:00 pm local time that Russian forces opened a “new route” to Kyiv after failing to capture Chernihiv. Russian forces have not yet entered Kyiv’s eastern outskirts. The Ukrainian general staff reported Russian VDV (airborne) troops redeployed from Belarus to the east bank of the Dnipro River due to damage to the Hostomel military airport on the western bank, now in Russian hands after Ukrainian forces withdrew sometime early on February 25. [9] Russian forces failed to secure Hostomel airport by air assault and appear to have taken it only when mechanized units from Belarus arrived. Ukrainian defenders appear to have damaged the runway enough to make it unusable, preventing Russian forces from airlifting troops directly onto Kyiv’s western flank and causing Russian forces to reprioritize the eastern axis of advance.

Ukrainian defenders appear to have damaged the runway enough to make it unusable, preventing Russian forces from airlifting troops directly onto Kyiv’s western flank and causing Russian forces to reprioritize the eastern axis of advance. Russian reconnaissance and sabotage units, many reportedly operating in civilian clothes or captured Ukrainian uniforms, are reportedly active in central Kyiv. A Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister reported Russian forces seized two Ukrainian trucks to break through Ukrainian lines into central Kyiv around noon local time. [10] The Ukrainian General Staff warned at 5:00 pm local time that Russian units in civilian clothes are operating in several unspecified Ukrainian cities. [11]

The Ukrainian General Staff warned at 5:00 pm local time that Russian units in civilian clothes are operating in several unspecified Ukrainian cities. President Zelensky, his Chief of Staff, and Prime Minister Shmyhal released a video from downtown Kyiv at 8:00 pm local time on February 25 stating “we are all here, defending our independence.” [12]

The Ukrainian military reported it redeployed unspecified units to assist in the defense of Kyiv. [13] ISW cannot currently confirm the extent of Ukrainian preparations to conduct urban fighting in Kyiv.

2) Kharkiv axis: Russian forces will likely envelop Kharkiv in the next 24 hours after failing to enter the city through frontal assaults on February 24. Russian forces are now advancing on a broad front along the northeastern Ukrainian border as of February 25.

Kharkiv civil authorities reported Russian forces entering the outskirts of Kharkiv from several directions at 9:00 pm local time. [14] Elements of Russia’s 25th Separate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade, part of the 6th Combined Arms Army and permanently deployed near St Petersburg, are confirmed to be active in Kharkiv. [15]

Elements of Russia’s 25th Separate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade, part of the 6th Combined Arms Army and permanently deployed near St Petersburg, are confirmed to be active in Kharkiv. Russian forces have reportedly crossed the northeastern Ukrainian border at several other points both west of Kharkiv, including Okhtyrka and Sumy. [16] Russian forces are likely advancing toward Kyiv on a broad front and may seek to envelop and isolate Kharkiv.

3) Donbas axis: Russian forces have achieved little success on the frontal assaults or the envelopment but may not have intended to do more than pin Ukrainian forces in the east. The Russians have not weighted their ground offensive efforts toward breaking through Ukrainian defensive positions on the line of contact, taking Mariupol from the east, or driving rapidly through Luhansk Oblast to the north. Ukrainian forces remain largely in their original defensive positions in the east. The Russians may be content to leave them there while concentrating on capturing Kyiv and imposing a new government on Ukraine. They may alternatively seek to envelop and destroy Ukrainian forces at and near the line of contact at a later date.

Russian forces have been unable to continue an enveloping maneuver through Donetsk Oblast as of 4:00 pm local time February 25. [17] They have not apparently reinforced their efforts to do so, however, suggesting that they may not be very determined to make rapid progress on this axis as long as Ukrainian forces remain in defensive positions. Ukrainian forces report undergoing continuous shelling.

They have not apparently reinforced their efforts to do so, however, suggesting that they may not be very determined to make rapid progress on this axis as long as Ukrainian forces remain in defensive positions. Ukrainian forces report undergoing continuous shelling. Ukrainian forces claim to continue to hold the entire line of contact in Donetsk and Luhansk as of 1pm local time February 25. [18]

Russian forces are likely conducting a frontal assault on Mariupol from the northeast. The mayor of Mariupol claimed Ukrainian forces destroyed twenty-two Russian tanks advancing from Pavlopil at 4:00 pm local time on February 25. [19] Russian sources reported shelling Mariupol with MLRS systems at 7:00 pm local time on February 25. [20]

4) Crimea axis: Russian forces fully captured Kherson and are likely on the verge of seizing Melitopol in the east. Unconfirmed reports indicate that Russian forces had bypassed Kherson earlier and headed directly for Mykolaiv and Odessa.

Russian forces reportedly captured Kherson at 6:00 pm local time on February 25. [21] Elements of the Russian 42nd Motor Rifle Division of the 58th Combined Arms Army and unknown VDV (Airborne) elements are confirmed to be active in Kherson. [22]

Elements of the Russian 42nd Motor Rifle Division of the 58th Combined Arms Army and unknown VDV (Airborne) elements are confirmed to be active in Kherson. Russian forces are advancing west of Kherson and reportedly bypassed it early February 25 before its capture by follow-on Russian forces later in the day. Ukrainian forces destroyed at least one bridge over the Dnipro to slow Russian forces. [23] The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense reported Russian forces are advancing on Mykolaiv. [24] ISW cannot confirm the current depth of Russian advances.

The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense reported Russian forces are advancing on Mykolaiv. ISW cannot confirm the current depth of Russian advances. Russian forces may have captured Melitopol, east of Crimea, late on February 25. Ukrainian forces reported defending the city at 10:00 am local time February 25. [25] Russian forces claimed to have captured the city as of 6:00 pm local time. [26]

Russian forces claimed to have captured the city as of 6:00 pm local time. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russia is deploying second echelon troops to Kherson on February 25. If confirmed, this is the first Russian deployment of second-line troops into Ukrainian territory. [27]

ISW cannot confirm any Russian amphibious landings as of 3:00 pm EST. Several Western sources misreported a quote from an anonymous US official that there are indications of Russia’s capability to conduct an amphibious assault west of Mariupol with thousands of troops as meaning a landing had already occurred. [28] Russia may wait until forces from Crimea have fully secured crossings over the Dnipro River or gotten closer to Odesa before attempting to seize Odesa by air and sea.

Immediate items to watch

Social media users observed a Russian armored column assembling in Stolin, Belarus, on February 25. [29] These forces could potentially conduct a new line of advance against Rivne in western Ukraine.

These forces could potentially conduct a new line of advance against Rivne in western Ukraine. Russian Naval Infantry have not yet conducted amphibious landings but retain the capability to do so against the Odesa or the Azov Sea coasts or both.

Russian forces continue to refrain from using their likely full spectrum of air and missile capabilities. The Ukrainian air force also remains active. Russian operations will likely steadily wear down Ukrainian air capabilities and eventually take the Ukrainian air force out of the fight.

Russian forces have not yet attempted the decapitation strike several analysts and outlets have forecasted and may attempt to do so in the near future.

Russia has sufficient conventional military power to reinforce each of its current axes of advance and overpower the conventional Ukrainian forces defending them.

While there have been advances by Russian forces, they appear to have been limited and an expected major offensive against the capital never materialized. While it seems clear that Russia's military operation has slowed, we could be experiencing a 'tactical pause' used to fortify supply lines and prepare for new coordinated offensives. With that being said, here is the best up-to-date information on the conflict we have and we will continue to update this post until stated as part of our ongoing rolling coverage on the conflict.

The Latest:

UPDATE—

We have finished our updates to this piece and you can find our continuing rolling coverage of this conflict here.

UPDATE: 6:00 AM EST—

Things have really picked up in the last few hours.

Ukraine says they have been resupplied with air-to-air missiles. Considering they use Russian-types, this must-have come from an Eastern European NATO ally with stocks of these missiles:

“Our Western partners for the aviation of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine have received a large batch of air-to-air missiles, which are already under the wings of our fighters. The pilots assure that there will be enough for all the occupiers!

There was this strange flight of three Ukrainian Il-76s to Poland on the evening of the 24th that could have been part of such an operation. Poland has the right missiles as it still flies the MiG-29 Fulcrum. It would have taken time to have flown these back to Western Ukraine and then distribute them to units closer to the front lines.

Regardless, the fact that Ukraine still has a viable tactical jet force at all is an amazing feat. Whatever accomplishments it has had in the air in the last four days — Ukraine claims many kills — have been personified in the morale-boosting myth of the 'Ghost of Kyiv.'

Ukraine has published a video showing one of their Turkish-built TB2 drones tearing up a group of Russian vehicles arranged on a runway. If the video is authentic, the fact that a TB2 is still operating freely, and especially over a major Russian formation, is remarkable and provides further evidence that Russia has not been able to come close to obtaining air superiority, even against such a vulnerable vehicle. Russia's vaunted electronic warfare capability also appears to be absent from this conflict as the TB2 should be vulnerable in that regard, as well.

Meanwhile, Ukraine says it down a cruise missile launched from a Tu-22 over Belarus:

few minutes ago, the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine shot down a cruise missile fired at the capital of Ukraine from the territory of the Republic of Belarus by a TU-22 aircraft. This is another war crime of Belarus and Russia.

Latest UK public intel assessment that basically matches with what we know:

It looks like major gas facilities were struck in the hotly contested northeastern city of Kharkiv. It seems there was a concerted effort to go after these types of facilities last night:

It is widely rumored that Russian forces have major logistics issues, especially in certain fronts, with troops looking for food and gasoline once they enter towns. Spetsnaz operate more independently so this may not be indicative of this issue, but still, they are helping themselves to a market's goods:

It looks like a number of MiG-29s got fully destroyed but it isn't clear if they were airworthy in the first place. Ukraine has a lot of derelict Fulcrums laying around:

POSTED: 4:00 AM EST —

Evidence has emerged of a Ukrainian Air Force Su-25 Frogfoot ground-attack jet having been lost in the fighting, apparently yesterday. Wreckage of the jet, operated by the 299th Tactical Aviation Brigade, which is home-based at Kulbakino, near Mykolaiv, in southern Ukraine, has been posted on various social media channels, with reports that the aircraft came down in the Kherson region, just north of Crimea, with the pilot being killed, although this is unconfirmed.

There are other reports of two Ukrainian Su-25s lost in the recent fighting, although no evidence of the second has yet appeared. Yesterday we saw an unconfirmed video posted of a Su-25 apparently taking a hit from a man-portable air defense system (MANPADS). That incident was also reported to have taken place in the Kherson region, so could involve the same aircraft as above. The light gray color of the Frogfoot in the video is certainly suggestive of a Ukrainian example, rather than a Russian one, as some have reported:

POSTED: 12:30 AM EST —

As the night wore on, what appeared to of been a massive sustained artillery barrage hit roughly 15 miles south of Kyiv in the hotly contested town of Vasylkiv. The attack appears to have struck the fuel farm at the airbase just north of the town, which has been a huge focus of ongoing fighting over the last couple of days. The loss of fuel could have an impact on Ukraine's military operations and the damage done by the blaze still isn't clear.

(Note: we do not know if the TOS-1 was used, in fact, that is very unlikely, but this is the video of the attack as seen from Kyiv)

An update on the status of the An-225, the world's largest operational aircraft, and control over the strategic Hostomel Airfield northwest of Kyiv: In a recent low-resolution satellite imager, at first, the An-225 did not appear where it was on February 23rd, which is the last satellite image we have of it. We thought that maybe it was moved into the large shelter in the short period between when the last image was taken and when the war kicked off. But on closer examination, that may not be the case. It appears to be pointed in the other direction on the tarmac in the latest image taken on February 26th. Much of the fields around the airport are scorched and by most accounts, the airfield is still being contested after a large Russian operation to seize control of it was eventually rebuffed by Ukrainian forces. This could be a trick of the optics as well. Hopefully, it made it to the shelter and is still in decent shape. You can read all about the situation and the An-225's presence at the airfield here.
