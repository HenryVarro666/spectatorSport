Among the victims of Russia's war in Ukraine is a Holocaust survivor who devoted his life to preserving its history.

Boris Romantschenko survived four concentration camps including Buchenwald, Dora and Bergen Belsen. The 96-year-old was killed last week when Russian forces shelled his apartment building in Kharkiv, the Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora Memorials Foundation said in a tweet.

""Now he has been killed by a bullet that hit his house,"" they wrote. ""We are stunned.""

Citing Romantschenko's granddaughter, the group said he lived in a multistory building that was hit by Russian shelling on Friday.

It also said, according to an English translation, that he ""campaigned intensively for the memory of the Nazi crimes and was vice president of the Buchenwald-Dora International Committee.""

The foundation shared a photo of several men standing in a row in front of various countries' flags, with one man reading from a piece of paper.

It said that the picture was taken during a 2012 commemoration event marking the anniversary of Buchenwald's liberation and that Romanchenko was reading out the Oath of Buchenwald, which was written for the first memorial service for the dead at the camp after it was liberated in 1945, to ""build a new world of peace and freedom.""

Although the exact death toll of Russia's aggression in Kharkiv — Ukraine's second-largest city — is not clear, police there said at least 250 civilians have died.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly described a goal of his military operation as the ""denazification"" of Ukraine, a claim that scholars have told NPR distorts both history and reality.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy mentioned Romantschenko in his daily remarks on Monday, noting how much he had been through.

""He survived ... the death conveyors created by the Nazis. And he was killed by a Russian projectile that hit an ordinary Kharkiv high-rise building,"" Zelenskyy said. ""Each passing day of this war makes it increasingly clear what their 'denazification' is.""

Earlier this month, Russian strikes in Kyiv hit the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center, where Nazis killed nearly 34,000 Jewish people over a 36-hour period in September 1941.

Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, said in a tweet at the time that it was ""history repeating.""

""To the world: What is the point of saying never again for 80 years, if the world stays silent when a bomb drops on the same site of Babyn Yar?"" he wrote.

Yet no one comes here now unless you man a checkpoint - or carry a weapon - or drive a T-72 tank.

We watched from the outskirts of the country's second-largest city as the Ukrainians and the Russians took potshots in the woods.

The air was filled with the deep-sounding boom of tank and artillery fire.

Observers and experts thought this city would fall to the Russians because it is located just 30 or so kilometres from the Russian border, but their much-vaunted military has been held on Kharkiv's northern outskirts and we were given access to this suburban frontier.

The Ukrainian Army took us to a children's camp, with wooden cabins and fantasy-like towers but we found the grounds pock-marked by exploding shells.

""The shelling is really chaotic, they land here and there, here and there,"" said our military guide, who asked not to be named.

Image: Kharkiv is about 30km from the Russian border

We found a soldier called Doc, who had been wiring up landmines when the shells came in. He told us that he had found cover in the bottom of a nearby maintenance shed.

""It was really scary, it was deafening, the basement protected me. I can't describe my feeling in words, my fear for my family,"" he said.

""Why are they sending shells and rockets here?"" I asked.

""They don't care, they send it anywhere they want. They don't even choose anymore,"" he replied.

Key developments in the Ukraine war:

• Ukrainian officials claim thousands of residents in besieged Mariupol have been forcibly relocated to Russian territory

• Russia says it struck Ukraine with cruise missiles from ships in the Black Sea and Caspian Sea, and launched hypersonic missiles from Crimean airspace

• Some 56 people were killed after Russian troops opened fire on an old people's home in the city of Kreminna, Ukraine claims

• Ukraine's deputy prime minister tells Sky News she believes genocide is being committed against Ukrainian people

• Ten million people have been displaced inside Ukraine or have fled abroad, the UN says

Army captain accused Russia of refusing to repatriate bodies

A few minutes later, we needed shelter as well. The sound of rockets alarmed our guide and we sprinted for cover in the maintenance shed.

The signs of war are all around, with the remnants of a Russian armoured column littering the trees.

It is a sign of what the Ukrainians have been able to achieve against a more numerous and better-equipped foe.

In a gruesome display of grit and intent, we were taken to see the bodies of five dead Russian servicemen outside a petrol station in a north-eastern suburb.

The Ukrainians had arranged them in the shape of a 'Z' - the identifying mark that Russians place on their military vehicles.

A Ukrainian Army captain, called Danylo Ishchenko claimed the Russians have refused to repatriate the bodies.

“It is with dismay that we have to report the violent death of Boris Romantschenko in the war in Ukraine,” the Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora Memorials foundation said in a statement.

Romantschenko died at home on March 18, after his building was bombed in the heavily shelled eastern city, the statement said, citing information from his son and granddaughter.

Describing him as “a close friend,” the foundation said Romantschenko was committed to educating others about the horrors of the Nazi era, and had been vice president of the Buchenwald-Dora International Committee.

Romantschenko was born into a family of farmers in Bondari, near the Ukrainian city of Sumy, on January 20, 1926.

Although he was not Jewish, he was taken by German soldiers when he was 16 years old and deported to the German city of Dortmund in 1942 to work as a forced laborer, as part of Nazi intimidation tactics against the Ukrainian population at the time.

A failed escape attempt landed him in the notorious Buchenwald concentration camp in 1943. He also spent time in the camps of Peenemuende, where he was forced to help build V2 rockets, in Mittelbau-Dora, and in Bergen-Belsen.

“This is what they call the ‘operation of denazification,'” said the head of Ukraine’s presidential office, Andriy Yermak, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s widely discredited claim that ridding Ukraine of supposed Nazis was a key reason for Moscow’s invasion.

“The whole world sees Russia’s cruelty,” Yermak added.

The Buchenwald Memorial said Romantschenko’s death “shows how dangerous the war in Ukraine is, also for concentration camp survivors.”

The foundation said it had partnered with 30 other remembrance groups and associations to set up an “aid network” to support former Nazi victims in Ukraine, including through donations of food and medicine.

It also plans to offer practical help to survivors fleeing Ukraine by picking them up from the Ukrainian border or finding them accommodation in Germany.

There are still approximately 42,000 survivors of Nazi crimes living in Ukraine, according to the aid network.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/96-year-old-holocaust-survivor-killed-in-russian-shelling-of-kharkiv/

___ Kyiv: The Russian military says it has carried out a new series of strikes on Ukrainian military facilities with long-range hypersonic and cruise missiles.

Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen.

The strike marked the second day in a row that Russia used the Kinzhal, a weapon capable of striking targets 2,000 kilometers away at a speed 10 times the speed of sound.

The previous day, the Russian military said the Kinzhal was used for the first time in combat to destroy an ammunition depot in Diliatyn in the Carpathian Mountains in western Ukraine.

Konashenkov noted that the Kalibr cruise missiles launched by Russian warships from the Caspian Sea were also involved in the strike on the fuel depot in Kostiantynivka.

He said Kalibr missiles launched from the Black Sea were used to destroy an armour repair plant in Nizhyn in the Chernihiv region in northern Ukraine.
