The EU will also ban the sale of all aircraft, spare parts and equipment to Russian airlines.

""This will degrade the key sector of Russia's economy and the country's connectivity,"" von der Leyen said.

EU leaders have agreed to impose ""massive"" sanctions on Russia in areas ranging from finance to transport, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in the early hours of Friday.

Speaking following an emergency summit dedicated to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, von der Leyen declared that ""we will hold the Kremlin accountable.""

""The package of massive and targeted sanctions European leaders approved tonight clearly demonstrates that — it will have maximum impact on the Russian economy and the political elite,"" she said.

The new sanctions will hit five areas: the financial sector, the energy sector, the transport sector, export controls and visa policy, according to the Commission chief.

""This package includes financial sanctions that cut Russia's access to the most important capital markets. We're now targeting 70 percent of the Russian banking market, but also key state-owned companies including the field of defense,"" she said.

The sanctions will increase Russia's borrowing costs and gradually erode its industrial base, according to von der Leyen, who also said Russia's elites will be hit.

When it comes to energy, ""our export ban will hit the oil by making it impossible for Russia to upgrade its oil refineries.""

There will also be a ban on the sale of aircraft, spare parts and equipment to Russian airlines, and limit Russia's access to crucial technologies needed to build semiconductors and other advanced technologies, officials said.

And when it comes to visas, ""diplomats and related groups and business people will no longer have privileged access to the European Union,"" she said.

""Our unity is our strength,"" von der Leyen said. ""The Kremlin knows this and it has tried its best to divide us, but it has utterly failed. It has achieved exactly the opposite,” she said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Commission president said, ""is trying to subjugate a friendly European country and he's trying to redraw the maps of Europe by force. He must — and he will — fail.""

Feb 26 (Reuters) - The European Union has imposed two packages of sanctions on Russia for launching an ""unprecedented and unprovoked military attack against Ukraine"".

Further sanctions, including the suspension of Russia's access to the global SWIFT payment system, could follow. The measures come on top of sanctions already in place since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.

According to the EU, the sanctions are designed ""to cripple the Kremlin's ability to finance the war, impose clear economic and political costs on Russia's political elite responsible for the invasion and diminish (Russia's) economic base"".

This is a list of the measures imposed so far:

BLACKLISTINGS

The EU has blacklisted hundreds of additional people, many of them members of the Russian parliament who voted for the recognition of the breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine. Their bank accounts in the EU are now frozen and they are banned from travelling to the bloc.

The most prominent individuals on the blacklist are Russia's President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, although they are exempt from the travel ban. This is meant to enable negotiations with them should the opportunity arise.

Still, Putin is now one of only three world leaders blacklisted by the EU, along with Syria's Bashar al-Assad and Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus. The blacklist currently includes 654 individuals and 52 entities in total.

SANCTIONS TARGETING FINANCE AND ECONOMY

Sanctions targeting Russia's economy are designed to cut the country's access to EU capital markets, increase borrowing costs for those sanctioned and gradually erode its industrial base.

They include an asset freeze and financial ban on three key Russian banks, add more state-owned companies to the sanctions list and ban Russian elites from depositing money in EU banks.

The sanctions also prohibit any form of lending and buying of securities by Russian banks and government, including the Russian central bank.

Seventy percent of the Russian banking system (measured by assets), government and key state-owned companies will no longer be able to refinance in the EU's capital markets, according to EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen.

ENERGY SECTOR

The sanctions ban the export of specific refining technologies, making it harder and more expensive for Russia to modernise its oil refineries. They add to an existing oil equipment ban imposed in 2014. Russia earned 24 billion euros in 2019 from refined oil exports to the EU, according to the bloc.

TRANSPORT SECTOR

The EU has banned the export, sale, supply or transfer of all aircraft, aircraft parts and equipment to Russia as well as all services related to the repair, maintenance and financing of aircraft.

Three-quarters of Russia's commercial air fleet were built in the EU, United States and Canada, according to the EU. The sanctions mean that ""Russia will not be able to maintain its fleet to international standards"", the EU said.

DUAL-USE GOODS AND ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY

The EU has toughened existing sanctions on goods that can be used for civilian as well as military purposes, targeting Russia's military-industrial complex and limiting its access to advanced technology such as drones and software for drones, software for encryption devices, semiconductors and advanced electronics.

These measures are meant to downgrade Russia's technological capabilities over time.

DIPLOMAT VISAS

Russian holders of diplomat passports will no longer enjoy visa-free travel to the EU, and Russian government officials and business people will no longer benefit from lower fees when applying for a visa. This measure will not apply to Russian citizens in general, who will retain the benefits they currently have.

TRADE WITH BREAKAWAY REGIONS IN UKRAINE

The EU has imposed an import ban on goods from breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, on doing business with tourism services there and on exports of certain goods and technologies.

The Council also agreed on a further package of individual and economic measures covering also Belarus to respond to the unprovoked and unjustified military aggression carried out by the Russian Federation against Ukraine.

President Putin and his government started a war against an independent, sovereign neighbouring country. The behaviour of the Russian leadership constitutes a major threat to international peace and security. Today, we are replying with the strongest possible restrictive measures. The European Union is united in its resolve, together with international partners and allies, to defend the peace order, international law and the rules based system. Josep Borrell, High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy

Swiftly implementing the European Council conclusions of 24 February, the package of sanctions adopted today includes:

Individual sanctions

In addition to freezing the assets the Russian President and Minister of Foreign Affairs, the EU will impose restrictive measures on the members of the National Security Council of the Russian Federation who supported Russia’s immediate recognition of the two non-government controlled areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine as independent entities. Sanctions will also be extended to the remaining members of the Russian State Duma, who ratified the government decision of the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance between the Russian Federation and the two entities.

Furthermore, the EU will also target those individuals, who facilitated the Russian military aggression from Belarus.

Economic sanctions

Financial sanctions

The package adopted today further expands the existing financial restrictions, thereby cutting Russian access to the most important capital markets. It also prohibits the listing and provision of services in relation to shares of Russian state-owned entities on EU trading venues. In addition, it introduces new measures which significantly limit the financial inflows from Russia to the EU, by prohibiting the acceptance of deposits exceeding certain values from Russian nationals or residents, the holding of accounts of Russian clients by the EU Central Securities Depositories, as well as the selling of euro-denominated securities to Russian clients.

These sanctions will target 70% of the Russian banking market, and key state-owned companies, including in the field of defence. They will increase Russia's borrowing costs, raise inflation and gradually erode Russia's industrial base. Additionally measures are taken to prevent the Russian elite's fortunes from being hidden in safe havens in Europe.

Energy sector

The EU will prohibit the sale, supply, transfer or export to Russia of specific goods and technologies in oil refining, and will introduce restrictions on the provision of related services.

By introducing such export ban, the EU intends to hit the Russian oil sector, and make it impossible for Russia to upgrade its oil refineries.

Russia's export revenues accounted for EUR 24 billion in 2019.

Transport sector

The EU introduced an export ban covering goods and technology in the aviation and space industry, as well as a prohibition on the provision of insurance and reinsurance and maintenance services related to those goods and technology. The EU will also prohibit the provision of related technical and financial assistance.

This ban on the sale of all aircrafts, spare parts and equipment to Russian airlines will degrade one of the key sectors of Russia's economy and the country's connectivity, as three quarters of Russia's current commercial air fleet were built in the EU, the US and Canada.

Technology sector

The EU imposed further restrictions on exports of dual-use goods and technology, as well as restrictions on exports of certain goods and technology which might contribute to Russia’s technological enhancement of its defence and security sector.

This will include products such as semiconductors or cutting-edge technologies.

Visa policy

Diplomats, other Russian officials, and business people will no longer be able to benefit from visa facilitation provisions, which allow privileged access to the EU. This decision will not affect ordinary Russian citizens. The decision will enter into force on the day of the adoption.

The European Union condemns in the strongest possible terms the Russian Federation’s unprovoked and unjustified military aggression against Ukraine, as well as the involvement of Belarus in this aggression.

The European Union demands that Russia immediately ceases its military actions, unconditionally withdraws all forces and military equipment from the entire territory of Ukraine and fully respects Ukraine’s territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence within its internationally recognised borders. The European Council calls on Russia and Russia-backed armed formations to respect international humanitarian law and stop their disinformation campaign and cyber-attacks.

The use of force and coercion to change borders has no place in the 21st century. Tensions and conflict should be resolved exclusively through dialogue and diplomacy. The EU will continue cooperating closely with neighbours and reiterates its unwavering support for, and commitment to, the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia and of the Republic of Moldova. It will continue strong coordination with partners and allies, within the UN, OSCE, NATO and the G7.

The relevant legal acts, including the names of the persons concerned by restrictive measures, will be published in the Official Journal.

Background

Individual restrictive measures will apply to a total of 654 individuals and 52 entities, and include an asset freeze and a prohibition from making funds available to the listed individuals and entities. In addition, a travel ban applicable to the listed persons prevents these from entering or transiting through EU territory.",https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/02/25/russia-s-military-aggression-against-ukraine-eu-imposes-sanctions-against-president-putin-and-foreign-minister-lavrov-and-adopts-wide-ranging-individual-and-economic-sanctions/

Following a late-night European Council meeting on the situation in Ukraine, Ms von der Leyen said the package included financial, energy and technological sanctions aimed to deter Mr Putin from redrawing “the map of Europe by force”.

In a series of tweets early on Friday morning, Ms von der Leyen said the sanctions show “how united the EU is”.

She said: “First, this package includes financial sanctions, targeting 70% of the Russian banking market and key state owned companies, including in defence.

“Second, we target the energy sector, a key economic area which especially benefits the Russian state. Our export ban will hit the oil sector by making it impossible for Russia to upgrade its refineries.

“Third: we ban the sale of aircrafts and equipment to Russian airlines.

“Fourth, we are limiting Russia’s access to crucial technology, such as semiconductors or cutting-edge software.

“Finally: visas. Diplomats and related groups and business people will no longer have privileged access to the European Union.

She added: “These events mark the beginning of a new era. Putin is trying to subjugate a friendly European country. He is trying to redraw the map of Europe by force. He must and he will fail.”

It comes after Boris Johnson on Thursday announced the “largest and most severe” package of sanctions Russia has ever faced to punish “blood-stained aggressor” Vladimir Putin.

Among the new UK sanctions introduced were measures to hit five further oligarchs, including the Russian president’s former son-in-law, and to target more than 100 businesses and individuals.

Mr Johnson said he was sanctioning “all the major manufacturers that support Putin’s war machine”, will ban Aeroflot from touching down planes in the UK and will freeze the assets of all major Russian banks, including immediately against VTB.

US president Joe Biden also delivered further measures to target Russian banks, oligarchs and high-tech sectors, with more troops deployed to Germany to bolster Nato.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ukraine-russia-sanctions-eu-b2023059.html

7,11da6af9-eb6b-4187-b059-1a9e2f328004,[],,"BRUSSELS - Responding to Russia's invasion in Ukraine, EU leaders wrapped up an emergency summit early Friday with agreement to punish Moscow with ""severe"" sanctions targeting its financial, energy and transport sectors.

European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen told a media conference afterwards they ""will have maximum impact on the Russian economy and the political elite"".

The summit started late Thursday, the day Russia started blasting military targets and sending tanks and paratroopers into its pro-Western neighbor Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the gathering by videolink, telling European presidents and prime ministers that ""he does not know if he will be able to speak with us another time,"" Luxembourg's leader Xavier Bettel recounted as he left.

Von der Leyen said the packet of sanctions -- the second adopted this week by the EU -- is ""targeting 70 percent of the Russian banking market, but also key state-owned companies including the field of defense"".

She did not go into details, but a list drawn up by her commission, seen by AFP, proposed adding two Russian private banks -- Alfa Bank and Bank Otkritie -- to entities sanctioned by the EU.

It also called for Russians to be prohibited from putting deposits over EUR 100,000 in EU banks or from purchasing euro-denominated securities.

Von der Leyen said the measures ""will increase Russia's borrowing costs, raise inflation and gradually erode Russia's industrial base"".

Energy sector targets of the sanctions included an export ban on equipment and technology Russia needs to upgrade its oil refineries.

An export ban on aircraft and plane parts to Russian airlines would also ""degrade a key sector of Russia's economy and the country's connectivity,"" von der Leyen said.

""The fourth point is we are limiting Russia's access to crucial technology -- we will hit Russia's access to important technologies it needs to build a prosperous future such as semiconductors or cutting edge technologies,"" she said.

""And finally, on visas, diplomats and related groups and business people will no longer have privileged access to the European Union.""

The latest sanctions will come into effect once legal texts are drawn up that are then formally approved by member states' foreign ministers and published in the EU's official journal. That was expected to happen as early as Friday or Saturday.

The leaders also discussed how to ramp up political, economic and humanitarian support for Ukraine.

While EU agreement on the outline of the sanctions was rapid, there were clear divisions over the option of kicking Russia out of the SWIFT network that the world's banks use to securely send messages in order to carry out transactions.

Zelensky has urged the West to use that lever, which has already been implemented to devastating effect against Iran's banking sector.

But US President Joe Biden, speaking in Washington as the EU summit started, said: ""It is always an option but right now that's not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take.""

That assessment was borne out by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who suggested as he arrived for the summit that SWIFT and other measures should be kept ""for a situation where it might be necessary, for other things"".

Other EU leaders, though, chafed at that stance.

""Talk is cheap... we have to be united around massive sanctions, severe sanctions,"" Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said.

Latvia's prime minister, Krisjanis Karins, said: ""SWIFT, I think it's the very right direction, I think we should go in that direction"", but only if other jurisdictions outside Europe also adopted that tactic.",https://www.baltictimes.com/eu_leaders_agree__massive__sanctions_on_russia/
