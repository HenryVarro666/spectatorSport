An image of the ship sitting half-submerged on its side appeared on social media on March 3rd, 2022. It seems that the vessel was sunk on purpose in order to keep it from falling into the enemy's hands. It's also possible this occurred due to Russian action, but that seems less likely at this time. While the 3,100-ton displacement Krivak III/Menzhinskiy class frigate offers little in terms of significant combat capabilities to the Russian Navy's Black Sea Fleet, its seizure would be a major propaganda win for Moscow that could act as a symbolic morale boost for Russian forces.

Equipped with a 100mm deck gun, smaller guns, anti-submarine grenade launchers, torpedo tubes, and a helicopter, the frigate may not seem like much, but it was a source of pride for the fairly meager but proud Ukrainian Navy.

The 30-year-old frigate was supposedly receiving repairs in the port city of Mykolaiv when it was sunk. Southwestern Ukraine is under new pressure from the Russian military with nearby Kherson falling just yesterday and fears that an amphibious assault on Odessa will be next.

We will continue to update this story as more information about the fate of the Hetman Sahaidachny comes to light.

A tweet, which has gone viral since being posted, shows Ukrainian Navy flagship Hetman Sahaidachny being scuttled in Nikolaev.

We take a look at what is the story all about.

About the incident

Here’s what we know so far about the image and the controversy surrounding it.

According to reports, images of the ship, appeared on social media, sitting half-submerged on its side appeared on 3 March.

The Drive, an independent publication, reported that the vessel was sunk on purpose by the Ukrainians in order to keep it from falling into the enemy's hands.

This claim has now been verified by Ukrainian defense minister Oleksiy Reznikov. A report by Interfax had the minister saying that the ship, which was under repair, was flooded by the ship's commander in order to avoid falling into the hands of the invaders.

""The commander of the flagship of the Ukrainian Navy followed the order to flood the ship so that the Hetman Sahaidachny frigate, which was under repair, would not fall into the hands of the enemy. It is hard to imagine a more difficult decision for a courageous soldier and crew,"" Reznikov wrote on Facebook on Friday.

While the Krivak III/Menzhinskiy class frigate doesn’t pose as a major threat to the Russians, it is the flagship of the Ukrainian Navy’s fleet.

Experts note that Ukraine may have scuttled their ship. The reason: the Ukrainians fear that if it had fallen into the Russians' hands, it would be a major propaganda win for Moscow and also act as a morale boost for their troops.

Features of the Hetman Sahaidachny

Commissioned on 2 April 1993, the 3,500-tonne Krivak III-class frigate was originally built at the Kerch Shipyard in Crimea.

The ship is equipped with a 100mm deck gun, smaller guns, anti-submarine grenade launchers, torpedo tubes, and a helicopter.

According to The Drive report, the 30-year-old frigate was supposedly receiving repairs in the port city of Mykolaiv when it was sunk.

While in service, the frigate has been widely used; in 2008, it took part in 'Operation Active Endeavour' in the Mediterranean Sea. The NATO operation was designed to prevent the movement of terrorists or weapons of mass destruction.

In 2013, the ship took part in NATO's ‘Operation Ocean Shield’, an anti-piracy campaign off the Horn of Africa.

Other such instances

In June 1919, 52 German warships were sunk in one day but this huge naval loss was not inflicted by enemy forces.

Instead the scuttling of the German High Seas Fleet in Scapa Flow was a deliberate act of sabotage ordered by a commander who refused to let his ships become the spoils of war.

It was the single greatest loss of warships in history.

In 1941, the German battleship Bismarck, heavily damaged by the Royal Navy, leaking fuel, listing, rendered mostly unmanoeuvrable and with no effective weapons but still afloat, was reported to have been scuttled by her crew to avoid capture.

Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February the fate of the Hetman Sahaidachny (F130) has remained unclear. Open source intelligence and satellite image analysis appears to confirm that the frigate was docked at the port city of Mykolaiv when the war began. As Russia’s invasion gathered pace the 30 year old Krivak III class frigate was due to begin a period of refit and it appears that she never left port.

On 3 March a photograph of the vessel half submerged at her moorings was shared on social media. The stricken frigate appears to have listed heavily to port as she has foundered at the wharf.

The Hetman Sahaidachny was the flagship of Ukraine’s small navy which before the start of the conflict included 13 patrol boats of various sizes – the fate and operational whereabouts of the rest of the fleet remains unclear.

On the 13 January it was announced byUkroboronprom (Ukraine’s state-owned defense conglomerate) that the Hetman Sahaidachny would undergo “repair and modernization works” under the direction of Ukraine’s Research and Design Center for Shipbuilding with half a dozen companies including the Ukroboronprom-owned Mykolayiv Shipyard.

From examination of satellite imagery from the past 10 days and through geolocation Overt Defense believes that the frigate is at the JV NIBULON LLC Trans-shipment terminal in Mykolaiv rather than Mykolayiv Shipyard.

While the Sentinel-2 satellite imagery is difficult to make out when cross checked against commercial satellite imagery available it appears to confirm the Hetman Sahaidachny’s position. Below is a Sentinel-2 image from 23 February, the day before the war began, showing the outline of the frigate docked.

Several days later, in the next available piece of satellite imagery the vessel can be seen now at an angle to the wharf – in a position very similar to that seen in the photograph shared on social media.

In an effort to verify the location below is a clearer commercial satellite image of the area in which the Hetman Sahaidachny appears to be docked, taken earlier this year, the low-resolution satellite image from 28 February and the photo of the stricken vessel for comparison. The coloured boxes on both highlight features which are believed to be shared. A number of cranes and three vessels moored behind the semi-sunken vessel appear to help confirm the location.

The only mention of the sinking of the vessel appeared in Russia news outlet Pravda on 27 February. Pravda reported that “according to reports in Ukrainian media, the warship was exploded in order to prevent its capture.” From the imagery available it appears that the vessel was scuttled rather than ‘exploded’ in order prevent the vessel falling into Russian hands. With only a 100mm main gun as its main offensive weapon the frigate would have been at a grave disadvantage against the Russian Black Sea fleet operating in the area. It is unclear when this took place with the earliest available Sentinel-2 imagery showing the vessel taken on the 28 February, 4 days into the conflict.

Update 4 March, 2022:

OSINT analyst Orion_int has been able to examine some higher resolution imagery of the area that Overt Defense believed the Hetman Sahaidachny to be located. The imagery from the 28 February clearly shows the vessel drifted away from the dock side, though not listing as heavily as she appears in the photograph of her.

We can now say with relative certainty that the Hetman Sahaidachny is resting, scuttled, in a dock at Mykolaiv.

On 4 March, Ukraine’s Minister of Defense Oleksii Reznikov confirmed the scuttling of the frigate in an update posted on his facebook page at around 9AM local time. Reznikov said:

“The commander of the flagship of the Ukrainian Navy followed the order to flood the ship so that the Hetman Sahaidachny frigate, which was under repair, would not fall into the hands of the enemy. It is hard to imagine a more difficult decision for a courageous soldier and crew.”

Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov announced that the Ukrainian Navy deliberately sank its own frigate Hetman Sahaidachny, which was under repair.

“A flag captain of the Ukrainian Navy followed the (Navy) order to scuttle the ship so that the frigate Hetman Sahaidachny, which was under repair, would not fall into the hands of the enemy. It is hard to imagine a more difficult decision for a courageous warrior and the team. But we will build a new fleet. A modern and powerful one,” he said.

Ukraine’s navy is much smaller than the Russian counterpart, and the Hetman Sahaydachny was considered to be largest ship in the fleet.

The Ukrainian Navy seems to be sparing no chances in gifting Russia with a significant combat trophy — the centerpiece of its fleet, the Hetman Sahaidachny — as Russia maintains its approach on Ukraine’s southern Black Sea-facing flank (U130).

On March 3rd, 2022, a photo of the vessel half-submerged on its side surfaced on social networks. The ship appears to have been deliberately sunk to prevent it from getting into enemy hands. It’s also conceivable that this happened as a result of Russian intervention, which seems unlikely at the moment. While the 3,100-ton Krivak III/Menzhinskiy class frigate provides nothing in the way of combat capability to the Russian Navy’s Black Sea Fleet, its capture would be a big propaganda victory for Moscow and a substantial confidence boost for Russian forces.

The frigate, which was armed with a 100mm deck gun, smaller guns, anti-submarine grenade launchers, torpedo tubes, and a helicopter, may well not appear to be very much, but this was a symbol of pride for the Ukrainian Navy, which was relatively tiny but proud.

When the 30-year-old frigate was sunk, it was reportedly receiving maintenance in the coastal city of Mykolaiv. The Russian military has increased its pressure on southwestern Ukraine, with adjacent Kherson surrendering only yesterday and worries that an amphibious attack on Odessa will follow.
