Civilians in Ukraine are actively participating in war against Russia. They have released videos on social media, which show Russian military vehicles being chased away or abandoned tanks captured. Some people have even taken these tanks on a ride in the field.

One of the interesting posts attracting social media's attention is a video from Instagram influencer Nastya Tyman.

A car mechanic by profession, Ms Tyman has posted a video on the social media platform offering a ""life hack"": How to start an armoured vehicle. In the tutorial video, she can be seen inside a Russian military vehicle.

The video was originally posted a year ago, but after the war broke out in Ukraine, she posted it again on Sunday with a fresh caption.

""If you happen to find a free or abandoned armoured personnel carrier, here's a life hack on how to start it. Save it so that you don't lose it,"" she says before pushing buttons and moving a lever to start it.

Ms Tyman can be further seen pressing a clutch-like pedal and pushing down the gear lever to move the military vehicle. She then uses the steering inside to move the vehicle around.

Since being posted, the video has been viewed more than 38,000 times. Ms Tyman has more than 800,000 followers on Instagram. She was born in Ukraine but is now based in Russia.

A few days ago, Ukraine's Defence Ministry released an infographic on its Twitter handle telling people how to launch Molotov cocktail at a Russian tank.

The war between Russia and Ukraine has intensified in the past eight days. On Friday, Russian forces seized Europe's biggest nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine after fierce fighting which set an adjacent training facility on fire.

However, essential equipment at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was unaffected after the fire, with no change in radiation levels, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said.",https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/russia-ukraine-war-video-teaching-users-how-to-drive-captured-russian-vehicles-goes-viral-2803005

Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, numerous social media posts have shared photos and videos claiming to show the armed conflict. But in many cases, the footage was taken prior to the invasion.

Such is the case with a video shared March 1 on Facebook.

The nearly 10-minute clip shows a train snaking its way through the countryside, pulling a long line of flatcars loaded with tanks.

“A huge military convoy heading to Ukraine …” reads the caption of the video, which racked up more than 300,000 views within a day.

On March 1, satellite images from Maxar Technologies, a space intelligence company, showed a 40-mile convoy of Russian tanks and vehicles on its way to Kyiv, Ukraine's capital. But the Facebook video doesn't show that convoy.

The same video was published on YouTube in 2017. It was taken in California, not Eastern Europe.

USA TODAY reached out to the Facebook user who shared the video for comment.

Video posted in 2017

The Facebook video is at least four and a half years old, as independent fact-checking outlets have reported.

The original video was published July 16, 2017, on YouTube. Titled “BNSF Military (Abrams Tanks) Train over Tehachapi,"" the clip has more than 9 million views.

BNSF is a railway company that operates solely in North America, according to its website. The company has a long history of working with the U.S. military to transport equipment.

“BNSF” can be seen on some of the locomotives in the video. Other engines sport the logo of Norfolk Southern, another American freight company.

Tehachapi, the location mentioned in the video caption, is a city in Southern California – not Eastern Europe.

The Tehachapi Pass Railroad Line accommodates an average of 36 freight trains per day, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers. USA TODAY found several other YouTube videos showing BNSF trains in the area.

The footage was applauded by many online, but posts are missing key context: the clip predates the Russian invasion by a year and was created by a Russian blogger.

“The future is a very weird place. Ukrainians are uploading videos on TikTok about how to drive abandoned or captured Russian military vehicles,” a Twitter user sharing the clip wrote on Feb. 28, 2021. The video has garnered over 6.9 million views ( here ). Other examples repeating similar claims can be seen: ( here ) ( here ) ( here ).

The viral clip shows a woman speaking in Russian inside military machinery, giving basic driving instructions like turning on the engine and how to use the clutch and gears.

TIMELINE

The video was not however filmed during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Reuters found earlier iterations, with a slightly different intro, were posted by creator Nastya Tyman on TikTok on Feb. 16, 2021 ( bit.ly/35oSJpg ).

On Feb. 23, 2021 she shared the video on Instagram alongside the caption “Congratulations to all the defenders on the holiday” ( here ). “Defender of the Fatherland Day” is a Russian holiday dedicated to honor war veterans and military servicemen on February 23 ( tass.com/society/1408423 ).

Tyman reposted the content on both TikTok ( bit.ly/3HvKJzD ) and Instagram ( here ) on Feb. 27, 2022 - three days after the Russian invasion started. Her two recent posts make no reference to the conflict or to Ukrainians.

CREATOR

Nastya Tyman is an auto mechanic and auto blogger. According to her YouTube About page ( here ), she is based in Russia. Contrary to online claims, she does not appear to be Ukrainian.

In another clip posted on Instagram about her driver’s license renewal ( here ), she can be seen showing what appears to be a Russian driver’s license (see purple “RUS” text) ( ria.ru/20110301/340188503.html ) and a Russian passport ( here ).

In an interview with Cosmopolitan Russia from 2020, Tyman said she liked to “shoot everything related to cars: repair, tuning, racing, drifting, car travel and so on in an endless list” ( here ). Other local media coverage about Tyman can be found ( here ) ( here )

Other examples of her car-related content are viewable ( here ), ( here ), ( here ), ( here ).

Tyman did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.

MIX UP

The footage has prompted some online to claim a Ukrainian user filmed the tutorial and shared it on social media platform TikTok to combat the Russian invasion. Some comments showing this confusion include:

“This is not funny at all. They’re doing this in order to know how to defend themselves from a country that’s chasing after them, prayers to them” and “I saw her video! She is amazing as are the other brave Ukrainians defending their country!”

“Now the Russians will abandon these tanks and set it up with explosives, thanks to tic Tok and the media. War is no game,” a comment from a Facebook user reads, in part.

A Reuters report on how the conflict has been experienced among social media’s youngest users on TikTok and how some Ukrainian users have made it a mission to share information and spread awareness with Western audiences on the platform is viewable ( here ).

VERDICT

Missing context. This video was not filmed during the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. An earlier iteration was posted on social media on February 2021. It was created by Russia blogger Nastya Tyman.

A video of a goods train carrying armoured tanks and military equipment has gone viral with the claim that this was Russian weaponry on its way to Ukraine.

This video along with the claim went viral on Facebook at the time when, as per the news reports, Russia sent a 40-mile-long convoy to the northern side of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.

One of the Facebook posts sharing the viral video claimed, “Russia has sent lots of Arms, Tanks, Weapons to the capital city of Ukraine on a Goods Train which is VIRTUALLY ENDLESS!”

The India Today Anti-Fake News War room (AFWA) found this video was not from Russia or Ukraine at all. It was first uploaded to YouTube in 2012 and shows a Canadian National Railways train carrying ground force equipment for the Canadian armed forces.

AFWA probe

Looking carefully at the viral video, we saw “CN” written on the locomotive engine. The engine number mentioned at the top was “2235”. The logo for the Canadian National Railway, the Canadian freight railway company, is similar to the “CN” seen on the engine.

We tried to find the original video with the help of the InVID tool and reverse image search. We found that the viral video has been on the internet for several years now.

Initial searches on Yandex or on Google, however, led us to YouTube videos that claimed it showed Russian forces.

But since we suspected the locomotive to belong to the Canadian National Railway, we kept searching for the original video. On Bing, the reverse image search results yielded the same viral video on YouTube with the title, “CN 2235, CN 8803 - Ultra Rare Canadian Military Train - Westbound - Lovekin, ON.”

The Amnesty YouTube DataViewer showed the video was uploaded on YouTube on August 30, 2012.

The details on YouTube about the video read, “Rare sighting of CN 2235 & 8803 moving a large division of the Canadian Armed Forces ground force equipment and some empty autocars westbound.” It is the same engine number that is visible in the viral video.

Geolocating the viral video

Since we could not find any credible news report regarding the video, we tried to geolocate the spot on the viral video.

As written in the title of the YouTube video, the train was Westbound and the place mentioned was “Lovekin, ON”. Lovekin is located in Ontario, Canada.

The website of the Toronto Railway Historical Association noted that Lovekin was “One of the best locations to view railroads in Ontario!” The website added, “The spot is located at the eastern edge of the Greater Toronto Area, south of the town of Newcastle on Lakeshore Road just a short distance from Lake Ontario.”

This website also published winter photos of Lovekin and the spot from where the railway lines are visible. Even though these photos were taken in the winter when the terrain was mostly covered by snow, the spot looked similar to the viral and the YouTube video.

With the help of Google Maps, we found the exact location where the viral video was shot. We cross-checked it with Google Street View.

The viral video was likely shot from an elevated location or from a bridge. We found on Google Street View a wooden bridge on Lakeshore Road overlooking the railway tracks.

Comparing the screengrab of the viral video, the YouTube video, and the Google Street View image, we found similar elements, like the electrical posts, another railway track beside the one on which the locomotive was running, and the same cluster of trees on the horizon.

From this evidence, we can conclude that a 2012 video of the Canadian National Railway in Lovekin, Ontario was falsely shared as the recent military movement of Russian forces in Ukraine.

Russia's attempts at a fast-paced assault haven't brought its forces inside Kyiv, the capital and the seat of the Western-leaning government the Kremlin appears intent on removing. Instead, the strategy has stretched supply lines and morale to a breaking point, while Russian tanks and military equipment have, at times, gotten stuck in mud or run out of gas.

That's the verdict of government officials and Russian military experts. It's also the picture painted by a flood of videos shared on social media, as the world watches the war and wonders how it appears to have started off quite so badly for the Kremlin.

One video, verified by NBC News, shows a Ukrainian civilian jokingly offering to give stranded Russian soldiers a ride before quickly pulling away. A second verified video shows a young Russian soldier sobbing as he eats and calls his mother. Another verified video shows a group of Russian soldiers looting a Ukrainian store for food.

Most challenging of all for the Russian military, Western officials and experts say, Moscow appears to have underestimated the willingness of Ukrainian citizens to fight back.

Jeffrey Edmonds, who served as the director for Russia on the National Security Council in the Obama administration, said he believes a failure in political leadership has brought Russia to this point after one week of battle.

""The Russian leadership actually believed the things they've said about the Ukrainians and didn't think they would put up a resistance,"" said Edmonds, now a senior analyst at CNA, a military think tank.

""Because of that and because they thought the war wouldn't be popular, they kept the scope of the invasion secret, even from the military, until the very last days.""

That left the military without the ability to plan a full-scale invasion and made them scramble to hit the Kremlin’s deadlines, Edmonds said.

Despite a monthslong military buildup and warnings from the West that Moscow planned to invade, Russian President Vladimir Putin denied those allegations until he finally ordered the assault last week. Putin has also made clear that he viewed the Ukrainian military as weak and believed the country would welcome Russian control — something that didn't quite bear out on the ground.

Though Russian forces are now beginning to reorganize and have had successes in the southern part of the country, even capturing the strategic city of Kherson on Thursday, experts believe that the Russian military is struggling because it deviated from the war it had trained to fight.

The large-scale strategic exercises Russia conducted just before its invasion — and which it maintained was the reason it had moved so many troops to the borders of its democratic neighbor — appeared designed to counter an offensive from the United States and its NATO allies.

The invasion of Ukraine is a different type of conflict, forcing Russian forces to create long logistical lines that they have not trained to maintain and also placing a greater reliance on conscripted soldiers, despite their push to move away from a drafted military, said Mark Cancian, a retired Marine colonel who studies Russia’s military as a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.

Conscripts tend to be younger, less motivated and poorly trained, Cancian said. The Russian government has maintained conscription after recent military reforms as it believes it remains a civic duty for ordinary citizens.

""About a third of the army are conscripts, two-thirds are what they call a 'contract,' we call them 'volunteers,'"" he added. ""I'm surprised to see so many conscripts in Ukraine because there are limitations on their use outside of Russia.""

It may be a surprise on the ground as well. Russia tried to push out its military forces in a lighter and more mobile way, a senior Western administration official said. While they moved quickly, they did not carry much with them, which meant they were less able to support themselves in a more protracted conflict.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/-rush-failure-russian-military-started-badly-ukraine-rcna18557
