I know enough English, but it's easier for me to write a large text in Russian and then re-do it with Google translator. If a pun seems to you, these are translation difficulties or my typos.

Thanks for the support

I am an ordinary resident of Kharkov. I lived behind the Kharkov ring road near the village of Tsirkuny. 25r from the border with Russia. I want to tell you about the events firsthand.

My mother is from Russia. I have an aunt, uncle, cousin and sister there. I spent all my childhood in the Russian countryside.

Those were great times!

Until February 24, I had an absolutely neutral attitude towards the Russian authorities. I even put up with the situation in eastern Ukraine and the occupation of Crimea. I just didn't want war!





Russia acted meanly - very meanly!

They provoked us to war for 8 years, and when we began to ally with European countries and received their support, they decided to come up with a special Kyiv regime in Ukraine. that oppress us. That we have Nazis in power. That the country is filled with neo-Nazis.

To be honest, I haven't followed politics for many years.

I just lived a peaceful life. Started a family, built a house. Made a small business.

Everyone knows that our small country has developed in all areas. They made visa-free travel to European countries for us. We flew to rest every year in any country. We often flew over the weekend to our favorite city of Istanbul in Turkey.





Everything was fine until I woke up on February 24 at 4:45 o'clock in the morning from the fact that I heard how the automation on the neighbor's diesel generator worked and I realized that the electricity was turned off again. This happens to us sometimes. We just started to fall asleep and Heard very loud explosions of ballistic missiles Caliber, Iskander and hail of hurricanes and tornadoes at a military base, which is located near Kharkov in my village about 1 km from my house !!!

We woke up in horror from the fact that my frame house was trembling and crunching from the terrible explosions of rockets. And also the floor was shaking like there was an earthquake!!!!





We took the children, grabbed the documents and our pets - a dog and a cat. In pajamas, we put on jackets and went down to the cellar in our garage.

And bombs and rockets continued to explode periodically for 30 minutes. Some flew past the military base and exploded near our house! It was very scary!





We later learned that one of Uragan rockets had landed in our neighbor's house a few houses away, damaging his car, killing his dog, and blowing up his front door and hallway in the house.





At about 5:50 we decided that it was VERY unsafe to stay here. We jumped into the car and left the village. passing by the military base, we heard a terrible silence and saw a huge smoke that covered the whole road and nothing was visible!





We went to the city to my mother and live in her house. We often go down to the basement, because rockets and air bombs fly into the city.

The day before yesterday, an empty rocket from a Smerch flew to a playground 200 meters from the house. And another one fell to the neighbors in the yard.

We have already become accustomed to the sounds of explosions and have learned to distinguish Grads, mortars and aircraft overflights.





And now about the military situation in the Kharkov region. You won't find this anywhere. I write as a witness and constantly monitor the sinusation on the outskirts of the city and in the occupied villages.





The Russians entered the village of Liptsy in the Kharkiv region from the side of the Russian border and at 4:45 turned off the power at the power plant (or bombed it - I don’t know).

All this is just terrible.

And what's even worse is that my house is located behind the ring road and it can be seen from high-rise buildings from Kharkov.

Near the village of Tishki and Tsirkuny.





I communicate with the locals in the telegram groups of these villages.

People have been sitting in basements without electricity since February 24th.

But it's good that there is gas and they can cook food and heat the whole house.

When the Russians entered, they immediately captured Liptsy. Later in an hour Tishki and Tsirkuny.





Already at 7:30 in the morning they were on the roundabout road of Kharkov. And we were still stuck in traffic to get to our parents' house in the city.





Later, a video appeared that there were already Russian tanks there.

But they did not stay long. Our artillery bombed them within a few minutes, and the ground army arranged a skirmish. A civilian who was just standing at a traffic light and wanted to go onto the ring road suffered from it. And also my neighbor's mom who got caught in the crossfire. She unfortunately died on the spot.





There were terrible traffic jams that I have never seen in my life!

A journey that used to take 20 minutes has become an eternity! We stood in traffic jams and moved very carefully, as we understood that everyone was nervous and we were afraid to damage the car!

Arriving in the city to my parents, we settled. We equipped the cellar, lowered down warm clothes, blankets, water and tools in case the house collapsed, so that we could get out. Although if there is a direct hit, nothing will save it.

There were terribly long queues at gas stations on the first day. It's good that I had a full tank of bool and 20 liters of gasoline in a canister that I took with me.

On the second day, we went to the nearest supermaкket to skimp.

We bought everything we need.

After 1 day, we calmed down a bit and decided to go buy secondary goods. Household goods, pet food, cigarettes and some alcohol. But there were already queues and there was almost nothing.

There were terrible queues at gas stations. Almost everything was closed because no one wanted to go out to work.

I have never seen queues like this...





Then my neighbor suddenly came out and said that they had not left on time and were now hiding in the back of their house. They took their neighbors and animals from neighboring houses. They also said that there was terrible fighting going on and that a helicopter had been shot down over our house and crashed in a nearby field.

As I wrote earlier, they have a diesel generator and they run it 2 times a day to cook food and charge the phone.

Literally 2 km away is the ring road and 1 km in the other direction is the already occupied Tsirkuny village in which the Russian army.





Anyway they left the village after 10 days!!!! having agreed with the Ukrainian army on the evacuation and get to Poltava to their relatives.





At this time, the entire northern Saltovka was fired upon with 120mm mortars and Grads. Many people have lost houses and apartments. Houses burned down on all floors.





We continue to stay at home in the city, although it is not so safe ...





And now about the occupied villages of Liptsy, Tishki and Tsirkuny.

On the very first day, the light went out - the Lipetsky ROE was turned off or bombed. There is different information. Most likely they were bombed.





And now about the Russian military.





People who stayed in these villages once a day climb onto the roof to report that they are alive and everything is fine. As I wrote above, the power plant was bombed. There is no light and people save their charge. The cell towers don't work, they climb up on the roof to make phone calls. Charge phones in the car or neighbors who have generators.

At the same time, the Russian military occupied the largest and most beautiful houses with fireplaces and households. They slaughter cattle, make BBQ. They rob stores with food, because they are not brought provisions, because Russia thought that they would be met here as liberators and gave them provisions for 3-4 days. I and everyone else do not understand why they decided that we would meet them with flower ...

They also took cars from local residents to drive back and forth between the villages.

Recently, the Russians posted a video of how they brought food to local residents, but in fact it turned out that they stole the food from local shops and from the Tsirkuny meat processing plant. And also the local butcher gave his products so that the locals would not die of hunger.

How disgusting to watch from a video about how they help Ukrainians with products that they themselves stole from them...





Many days have passed, the Russians do not let the circus and others out of the village, because they are afraid that people will pass on information and the coordinates of their base.

They shot several cars with civilians at the checkpoint who were trying to leave for Kharkov. They are still standing there and their corpses are in the cars...

People ask for help, but they say that there is only one option - to go to Belgorod. Yes, indeed many people left for Belgorod. But as it turned out - when leaving for Belgorod without documents, they had to apply for refugee status and sign a paper stating that they could not leave Russia for 3 years or the like...

For those who have a foreign passport, they managed to pass through Russia to Latvia and from there to Europe.





And also a very interesting fact. These creatures declare on video that they are absolutely not opposed to people leaving for Kharkov. But the Ukrainian military does not let anyone in.

And they also said that Ukraine cut off the electricity in those villages ... how stupid it is when everyone knows that the regional power plant is located in Liptsy, which they bombed back on February 24 ... How can you lie so blatantly???





During all this time, attacks were also carried out on Kharkov from the east. From the Chuguev side. It houses a large Ukrainian military base and a temporary town, as well as a military airfield.

So, from the east, they bombed the Horizont district in Kharkov so hard that hail shells covered the east district in Kharkov and even got the Rogan District, where my mother and younger brother live. From the first day they went down the stairs to the basement from the 13th floor, every time they heard explosions. And when the village was bombed and several shells hit their house, they left Kharkov for Poland, and from there to Germany, where they registered the status of refugees.





In general, what we have at the moment. The Armed Forces of Ukraine pushed back the Russian offensives in all directions except the northern one. In the village of Tishki, there is an incessant bombardment of residential buildings on a saltovka. Almost nothing remains of the houses...





And now about the city center of Kharkov.

Putin decided to break everything he wanted. Caliber missiles flew into the center of the city, on Freedom Square. directly to the Kharkiv Regional State Administration.

And they also do not disdain the bombing of fab-500 residential areas and other infrastructure in Kharkov with air bombs.





Today, March 11, Lukashenka, the president of Belarus, met with Putin and he said that he had learned that Ukraine wanted to attack Belarus and Russia on February 24. And if not for the attack of Russian missiles, then Ukraine would have attacked them ...

I have no words.





I’m already silent about the fact that Russia in the news shows that they were the first to attack them, as well as that we threatened with nuclear weapons and that we have secret laboratories for the development of biological weapons on the territory of Ukraine. And that Ukraine from the Kherson reserve launched loaded birds into Russia to spread a dangerous virus ...

The Russian military also discovered in the LNR a secret laboratory for the creation of military drugs for the Ukrainian Nazis...

It seems to me that they use drugs and then come up with takin news ...





In fact, everything is obvious to us and to the whole world that Russia simply did not like that Ukraine is trying to become a European and join the European Union. And Russia was afraid that we might join NATO.





And here is the most interesting thing - the inhabitants of Russia believe everything they say in Russian news, they write to me that we were the first to attack, that we killed children in the Donbass, that we have Nazis and so on.





But they cannot answer the question WHY UKRAINE HAS BEEN SUFFERING FOR 8 YEARS AND DECIDED TO ATTACK FROM at that moment WHEN ALL russian TROOPS ARE ON THE BORDER IN EXERCISES??!!





In my opinion, everything is obvious here, they tried to provoke a conflict for 8 years, but we did not answer, and when all the countries began to poke us, they decided to destroy our country because of the fear that we would join NATO ...





Days passed and I could not sit idle.

A few days after the start of the war, I saw on the Internet a video of Russians and 120mm mortars firing at Saltovka (a residential area).

https://youtu.be/z-uGN_LS7Rs

They say they are shooting at the Ukrainian army. I found that area on the map. I know her well because I go fishing and love to drive through the forests and fields by car (by the way, this car was left in the garage near the house ...)





That pictures of the place that I identified. By the way, we can conclude that I take into account the distance to residential buildings and the use of a 120mm mortar and their mines (mine FO-36) they fly just 7 km to residential buildings ... what can I say ...

Google maps - https://goo.gl/maps/USefYdeSAoQGvS3b7

mortar radius 120mm





And here is how the houses on the Saltovka district of Kharkov look like





Several days have passed. Already accustomed to the shots of the Ukrainian army. Our area is not on the outskirts of the city, so we thought we were at a safe distance from the Russians. until it's time...

March 13

Read in the news from volunteers:

Hungry Russians plunder humanitarian convoys at every checkpoint, taking some of their food and clothing. Volunteer organizations are complaining about this...

I've been thinking for a couple of days now, how could they come to kill people for $52 a day???

They were told that they would be paid 52 dollars a day for their service... In rubles, of course...

So the question is, what kind of beggars do you need to be or stupid? To come to kill people for this money???

And here it is even more interesting ...

Since the beginning of the war, the ruble has officially fallen by 2 times. And on the black rune, the price of the dollar increased 3 times...

So their 52 dollars a day has already turned into 17-26 dollars.

The Russian stock exchange is closed until March 19. So after March 19, the ruble will fall even more.

So here's my question. Russian beggars or stupid?

I'll ask again? It's worth it?

For some reason, Russian bloggers call us ""naked-ass bums."" Well, it’s understandable here, bloggers don’t have enough brains to find a job. But still, Russian propaganda is also working here, which inspired that in Ukraine there is a ""special Kyiv regime"", there is poverty and we need Russia's help to liberate the country...

The Russians themselves will not even be able or willing to answer any of these questions:

-Why do children dance at our parades, but at the parade, victory in Russia is measured every year with rockets who is longer and thicker?

-Why in Ukraine a loader or a construction worker or a taxi driver earns as much money a day as their soldiers are paid to die and kill other people?

-Why do Russians take loans for Kia and Hyundai and drive them for the rest of their lives, when on average we change a car for a newer one in 1-2 years?

-Why do we have apartments in new buildings sold out at the time of laying the foundation, while in Russia people take out a mortgage to pay it off for the rest of their life?

-Why do Russians know about the world only from the words of their television?

Show them someone until they have turned off the Internet how people live in normal countries. Where people's money is spent on infrastructure and development and not on rockets and villas of deputies and mayors.

More about yesterday's events...

Yesterday I decided to go to bed earlier, while it was quiet. But I couldn't sleep for a long time.

At 1:45 a.m. I am through my eyes closed and a window barricaded by a cabinet (in case of glass fragments, etc.). So I saw a flash with my eyes closed and after a moment a very loud explosion, I got up and involuntarily said - Wow!

My heart was pounding just as hard as on that day on February 24th at 5 o'clock in the morning.

I already realized that this is a new sound, which is different from everything I've heard.

We already put on our jackets and went down from the cellar ....

Then I heard a distant, dull boom, then a whistle for about 1-2 seconds and again a loud explosion. Then it became clear to me that a 120mm mortar was working to my area. And this time the shells are not flying anywhere, but somewhere very, very close!

From the videos from my YouTube channel that I constantly collect from local news, communities and witnesses, I already understand what kind of weapons they use and shells. In this case, these are fo-36 and 120mm mortar. According to the characteristics that I could find, this mine flies a maximum of 7 km.

In a few minutes there were about 5 very loud explosions.

We went down to the cellar after about the time of 2-3 explosions, the rest were within a few minutes and everything calmed down ...

From one of the explosions, a window in the bathroom opened, which was ajar for a couple of mm for ventilation ... It is clear that something was close, but everything passed. The heart stopped beating strongly and we calmed down.

Then I managed to calm down and fall asleep. Everything seemed to be good. But in the distance we heard the firing of tanks and other guns. Which were all given away.

We managed to sleep right up to 9 o'clock, although there was a 5 o'clock warning in the air raid app, which we did not hear. And the warning sirens in the city are only heard on the street. You understand, modern windows, a house insulated with mineral wool is quite quiet inside.

I'll tell you right away. Firing from air defense systems and artillery installations from urban areas takes place around the clock. Sometimes a couple of times in a few hours. And sometimes it does not stop for several tens of minutes.

As I said earlier, we already know when ours are firing and distinguish a shot from the arrival of grad or mines.

In the morning, one of the Kharkiv news communities showed the consequences. Pieces of 2 mines flew to the Saltov medical complex, breaking the entrance and breaking windows in the traumatology and maternity hospital buildings, and one mine almost hit the maternity hospital!

Another one for a house.

Here are links to videos of the aftermath.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyv_hlCK7oc

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voMJlvlWlzE

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1pmqUcadlc

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3vQvxrqmI

But I could not understand why the sounds were so loud and the flash that I saw through my closed eyes .... After all, the medical complex is located at least 2 km from us in a straight line.

Later, when we and the neighbors began to go outside to look around, it turned out that one shell flew into the old house, literally 2 houses from ours on the other side of the street, and 1 flew to the playground 500m from the house.

I will post pictures and a screenshot from the video so that the location is not clear - just so that the gunners do not take into account their errors and do not reconfigure their guns where they wanted ...

By the way, yes. The government constantly warns us not to report explosions and the consequences in real time so that the gunners cannot reconfigure their guns.





Oh, we have air raid alert again.....

Okay, don't worry, We are already used to it. Let the guys from the Armed Forces of Ukraine do their job...

So, what am I talking about... Oh yeah.





I will attach a photo of the destroyed concrete slab fence and the house. But it was quite dilapidated and before that, and there was no one there ... So no one was hurt.

And screenshots from the playground.

Now it became clear why it was loud and bright!

If you draw in a straight line from the places of hits and the medical complex, then the straight line just ends on the field near the ring road behind the northern saltovka after 7 km from the ""arrivals of mines""

Oh yes. Today we moved to another house with relatives, which is 1 km further from these objects. Just in case. At least for a couple of days.





On the night of March 14, our area was covered with GRAD!

He covered our entire area! One charge fell behind our house and destroyed the household building and broke the glass in the window.

At the end of our street, a whole rocket flew into a house of people and killed a man, destroying part of his house.

Even on a neighboring street, a woman was killed by shrapnel ...

At a distance of several hundred meters, a couple of cars burned down. Many houses lost their glass...





Why don't we leave, you ask?

I have 2 familiar families who have left and they are sitting in some hotel on the border with Poland and cannot cross it, because in Ukraine it was forbidden for men aged 18 to 60 to leave. No - no one is forced to join the army, they do not issue subpoenas and are not forced to go to the front. Because the army is complete, volunteers are taken only with experience in service and participation in hostilities after the events in the east of the country. The territorial defense is so staffed that they almost do not accept volunteers, the same is trying to take only those who know something or have experience.

Apparently, men are not released for insurance, in case the situation worsens. But I think so in any country during the war.

They just don’t let only men out, and the children and wives don’t want to leave on their own, so they sit in a strange city and wait for changes ...

Guys - this is our home, our city, our country and our land! We are not afraid of anything! We have no fear to run away! Yes, loud sounds sometimes scare, but leaving is not our choice! At least while the situation is in this state ... And then we'll see ...

We have a curfew. Which every night from 18 to 6 am.

Usually they attack northern saltovka with Grad and mortars when it gets dark.

So far optimistic.









I created a YouTube channel and upload videos there, mostly about Kharkiv. What has been happening in it since the beginning of the ""Russian special operation"".

I am not a propagandist of anything and I do not call for anything!

We just want peace and worldwide publicity for Russian aggression on the territory of Ukraine.

Just be aware of all the events in Kharkov and Ukraine.

Thank you all for your support!
