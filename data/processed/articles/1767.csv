He said that there was no information yet on any casualties.

Sievierodonetsk is the temporary headquarters of the regional authorities as Luhansk city has been controlled by Russia-backed separatists since 2014.

Authorities in Luhansk had earlier urged civilians to evacuate “while it is safe”, warning that Russian bombardments could cut off escape routes.

Ukraine has said Russian troops that invaded on Feb 24 are regrouping and preparing for a new offensive in the Donbass area, which includes Luhansk.

Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in online comments that Ukraine aimed to open 11 humanitarian corridors on Wednesday to evacuate civilians.

“We will take everyone out if the Russians allow us to get to the meeting places (for evacuation). Because, as you can see, they don’t always observe ceasefires,” the Luhansk region governor, Serhiy Gaidai, wrote on the Telegram messaging app.

""I appeal to every resident of the Luhansk region – evacuate while it is safe ... While there are buses and trains – take this opportunity."" Gaidai said rail connections in the Donetsk region of Donbass had been damaged this week and took several hours to repair.

“This is another alarm bell,” he said.

Gaidai said separately in a video address that Russian forces had not managed to break through Ukrainian defences in his region but are destroying “everything in their path” and would “stop at nothing”.

Russia has said it does not target civilians in its “special military operation” aimed at demilitarising and “denazifying” Ukraine. The Kremlin’s position is rejected by Ukraine and the West as a pretext for an unprovoked invasion.

Elsewhere, a Red Cross convoy arrived in the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia on Wednesday after failing to reach the besieged port city of Mariupol, an AFP journalist on the scene reported.

Accompanied by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), seven buses and at least 40 private cars arrived in the city, the journalist said.

The ICRC said in a social media post on Wednesday that more than 500 evacuees in total were escorted to Zaporizhzhia in the operation, including people who had been in Mariupol.

On Monday, the Red Cross said that the team it had dispatched several days earlier to help evacuate civilians from Mariupol was being held by police in Russian-controlled territory.

The organisation said on Twitter on Wednesday that it had attempted for five days to reach the city, which has been under sustained Russia bombardment since Moscow invaded in late February.

“But security conditions made it impossible,” it said.

“Thousands are still trapped in the city. They urgently need a safe passage out, and aid to come in,” it added.

Russian forces late last month struck a Red Cross facility in the city, home to half a million people before the war, where officials have warned of a humanitarian disaster.

Repeated attempts to evacuate residents have collapsed, though some have made the dangerous dash to freedom from the city alone. Both the Russian and Ukrainian sides blame each other for the failed evacuations.

The city’s mayor earlier this week estimated that some 90 per cent of the city had been completely destroyed as a result of the war.

“Today we’re dramatically escalating the financial shock by imposing full blocking sanctions on Russia’s largest financial institution, Sberbank, and its largest private bank, Alfa Bank,” a senior administration official briefing reporters said.

Sberbank holds nearly one-third of Russia’s total banking sector assets, the official noted, adding that the US has now fully blocked “more than two-thirds of the Russian banking sector.”

Second, the senior official announced, “In alignment with the G7 and the EU, we’re announcing a ban on new investment in Russia.” That will be implemented with an executive order signed by US President Joe Biden.

The administration is also putting full blocking sanctions on a new set of Russian elites and their family members, including Putin’s adult daughters Mariya Putina and Katerina Tikhonova, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov’s wife and daughter and members of Russia’s Security Council, including former President and Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin. The US has already sanctioned more than 140 oligarchs and their family members and over 400 Russian government officials, the senior official said.

The US will also apply full blocking sanctions on critical major Russian state-owned enterprises, which will be announced by the Department of Treasury on Thursday. The official also noted Tuesday’s announcement that the Department of Treasury has blocked Russia from making debt payments with dollars stockpiled at US banks.

The senior official noted the crippling effect of US measures on the Russian economy since its invasion of Ukraine.

“Russia’s GDP is projected to shrink by double digits this year… It’s not in the process of being isolated as a pariah state. The economic shock this year alone is projected by the IMF (International Monetary Fund) to wipe out the past 15 years of economic gains,” the official said.

Pressed about the efficacy of sanctions in ending Putin’s war in Ukraine, the senior official sought to underscore the effect they are having on life in Russia and said Putin would eventually have to reckon with his people.

“Even an autocrat like Putin has a social contract with the Russian people. He took away their freedom in exchange for promising stability and so he's not giving them stability,” the official said.

“The question really is not so much: What can we do and when will that have an effect? I think it’s: What's the endgame here for Putin? What’s he playing for?” the official added. “This is very clearly becoming a failure for him and at some point he will have to recognize that reality.”",https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-04-06-22/h_225e976b7eba10e7e471e3f1b5c8aca3

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

MUKACHEVO, Ukraine — Ukrainian officials called Wednesday for evacuations in three provinces near the Russian border amid new signs that President Vladimir Putin’s troops are escalating their assault on eastern and southern cities following a failed attempt to take the country’s capital. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight Local officials reported renewed Russian shelling in the eastern Donetsk region, killing at least five people, and as many as 10 high-rise apartment buildings on fire in Severodonetsk, in the neighboring Luhansk district. U.S. analysts said Moscow has begun gradually shifting the focus of its military operations to the eastern border provinces after withdrawing thousands of troops that previously encircled the capital, Kyiv.

The continued violence came amid fresh reports of human-rights atrocities in Ukrainian cities and towns that had been under Russian control. Accounts of rape and summary executions of civilians by Russian occupiers prompted the United States and several allies to announce new economic sanctions, including measures targeting two of Russia’s largest banks and Putin’s adult children.

“We’re going to further increase Russia’s economic isolation,” President Biden said in a speech announcing the sanctions at a meeting of North America’s Building Trades Unions. “The United States will continue to stand with the Ukrainian people in their fight for freedom.”

Biden again accused Russia of committing “major war crimes” and said the additional measures would further strain its economy. “Civilians executed in cold blood, bodies dumped into mass graves,” he said, ticking off a list of alleged war crimes. “A sense of brutality and inhumanity left for all the world to see unapologetically.”

The speech came as NATO and European Union leaders gathered to consider additional measures to punish Moscow and support Ukraine. A possible European ban on Russian coal is expected to be approved on Thursday, along with additional military aid for Kyiv from the NATO alliance.

Pentagon officials confirmed Wednesday that Russia had, in the past 24 hours, completed an evacuation of all forces from around Kyiv and Chernihiv, two cities it had tried unsuccessfully to capture in the opening days of the invasion, now in its sixth week.

While U.S. analysts have not observed a tangible increase in troops and tanks in the Donbas — the energy-rich region near the Russian border that includes Donetsk and Luhansk — the Pentagon believes that retreating units are regrouping for a concentrated assault on the eastern provinces. Some of the recently withdrawn troops are now in neighboring Belarus, where the pro-Moscow government is allowing Russia to resupply its exhausted battalions. Few, if any, have reentered Ukraine so far, a senior Defense Department official told reporters.

“Our assessment is that they won’t want to spend too much refitting and resupplying because they have made a very public show of saying that they’re going to prioritize their efforts on the Donbas region,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity according to rules set by the Pentagon.

For their part, Ukrainian forces are “absolutely adapting and adjusting in real time to Russian efforts now to increase their activities” in eastern Ukraine, the official said. “As they have beaten back the Russians or as the Russians have left, they are reoccupying that ground and making their own assessments about what their force posture ought to be going forward.”

Increased shelling in the eastern provinces claimed additional casualties on Wednesday, including the five people reportedly killed in Donetsk. Provincial Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said four people were killed by Russian artillery fire in the city of Vuhledar as they waited to receive humanitarian aid. The fifth victim, also a civilian, was killed during an attack on the town of Ocheretyn, he said, and six houses and a kindergarten facility were destroyed.

A regional military official in Luhansk reported “mass shelling” in Severodonetsk. The number of casualties was unclear. Video posted on Facebook and verified by The Washington Post shows townspeople scrambling for cover as shells explode in a residential street.

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk, in broadcast remarks, urged residents of the Luhansk, Donetsk and Kharkiv regions to start preparing for the expected Russian onslaught. While the Kremlin has described the troop withdrawal from Kyiv as a “goodwill” gesture to facilitate peace talks, she said it was clear that more attacks were coming. Moscow has greater support in the east, where Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists have been locked in a grinding conflict for many years.

“We need to evacuate,” she said. “We must do it because then people will be on fire, they will be shot … and we will not be able to help them.”

Elsewhere in Ukraine, rescue workers looked for survivors in rubble-strewn neighborhoods newly freed of Russian troops. Washington Post reporters witnessed scenes of devastation in Borodyanka, a community northwest of Kyiv that had been pummeled by airstrikes that gouged huge chunks out of residential buildings.

In a schoolyard that was converted into a garrison while Borodyanka was occupied, the Russians had cut a trench through a playground and built a sandbag wall along the perimeter fence, with openings for gun emplacements.

In a ruined apartment a few blocks away, Katia Palivshenko, 34, said she feared that some of her neighbors were still trapped, and likely dead, in the basements of bombed-out buildings nearby. Cellphone service had faltered when the town came under attack, and she had not heard from some of her friends since then.

“They were below ground but then messages stopped coming,” she said. “We don’t know what happened to them.”

In Bucha, a town associated with some of the war’s most disturbing assaults on Ukrainian civilians, soldiers and police continued the gut-wrenching work of removing and burying bodies, dozens of which still lay in the streets and in open fields. Some bodies were booby-trapped by the departing Russians, officials said.

The city remained almost entirely deserted, as mine-clearing teams searched methodically for hidden bombs. On Vokzalna Street near the train station, the blackened hulks of Russian tanks, all destroyed in a fierce counterattack by Ukrainian forces, sat in an eerie silence that was punctuated only by the barking of stray dogs.

The images from Bucha have evoked shock and condemnation around the world, including at the United Nations, where dozens of countries have backed an effort to boot Moscow from the body’s Human Rights Council — a move reserved for countries that have repeatedly violated human rights. A vote of the 193-nation body could come as early as Thursday morning at the U.N. headquarters in New York.

The U.S. sanctions announced on Wednesday targeted Sberbank and Alfa Bank — two of Russia’s biggest financial institutions — and two daughters of the Russian president, Katerina Tikhonova and Mariya Putina. U.S. officials say much of the Putin family’s enormous wealth is stashed away in accounts held by family members. The White House also is seeking new economic sanctions against state-owned Russian enterprises involved in shipbuilding and aircraft manufacturing, as well as relatives of Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.

Members of the 27-nation European Union were preparing to decide Thursday on a measure banning all imports of Russian coal, a key revenue source for Moscow, even as NATO leaders discuss ways to further isolate Russia while bolstering Ukraine’s ability to defend itself.

“Today, tomorrow, we’ll continue to talk about not only how we can sustain these efforts but how we can build upon them,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters. He was flanked by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who earlier in the day warned that the conflict could become protracted despite the surge of Western military support to Ukrainian forces.

“We have to be realistic and realize that this may last for a long time, for many months, for even years,” Stoltenberg said. “And that’s the reason why we need also to be prepared for the long haul.”

Britain launched additional sanctions against eight Russian oligarchs and two Russian banks and vowed to end all dependency on Russian coal and oil by the end of 2022. “We are showing the Russian elite that they cannot wash their hands of the atrocities committed on Putin’s orders,” Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said.

In Washington, the Justice Department announced indictments against Russian oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev, who U.S. officials accused of illegally supporting pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine. Speaking at a news conference, Attorney General Merrick Garland also announced the successful disruption of a global “botnet” — or network of hacked computers — that he said was controlled by the Russian military intelligence agency known as the GRU. Moscow has used similar networks to attack Ukrainian targets, Garland said.

“It does not matter how far you sail your yacht. It does not matter how well you conceal your assets. It does not matter how cleverly you write your malware or hide your online activity,” Garland said. “The Justice Department will use every available tool to find you, disrupt your plots and hold you accountable.”

For the latest developments of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, all times EDT:

9:18 p.m.: “This is just an attempt to hide the evidence and nothing more. But they will not succeed, because they killed a lot.”

-- Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, quoted in The New York Times, saying that Russian soldiers are hiding the bodies of those they've killed.

7:45 p.m.: U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told the House Financial Services Committed on Wednesday that Russia should be expelled from the Group of 20 major economies forum, Reuters reported.

Yellen told lawmakers that Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the killings of civilians in Bucha ""are reprehensible, represent an unacceptable affront to the rules-based global order, and will have enormous economic repercussions in Ukraine and beyond.""

7:16 p.m.: U.S. Undersecretary of State Victoria Nuland said Russia’s disinformation about its war against Ukraine needs to be exposed.

She said the Russian lies include blaming Ukrainians for things Russians have done, even “the war crimes we see on the ground.”

Nuland was in Cyprus on a five-nation tour to strengthen ties and rally support for Ukraine, The Associated Press reported.

6:43 p.m.: A few Ukrainian troops have learning how to operate Switchblade drones, single-use weapons that fly into their targets and detonate on impact, a senior U.S. defense official disclosed on Wednesday, Reuters reports.

The Ukrainians arrived in the United States for regular military education programs before Russia's invasion on February 24.

""We took advantage of the opportunity to pull them aside for a couple of days and provide them some training, particularly on the Switchblades,"" the senior U.S. defense official told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Until now, the United States and NATO have had to limit the weaponry they send to Ukraine to the systems Ukrainian forces knew how to operate before Russia's invasion.

6:12 p.m.: Rich countries will tap 120 million more barrels of oil from emergency reserves in a bid to calm crude prices that have soared following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the International Energy Agency said on Wednesday.

The move includes 60 million barrels to be released by the United States, which has recently announced it would tap its strategic oil reserves, Agence France-Presse reports.

5:50 p.m.: The parents of a former U.S. Marine held captive in Russia pleaded for information about him on Wednesday, expressing fears about his “rapidly declining health” and that “something terrible” had happened to him.

Joe and Paula Reed, who met last week with President Joe Biden about the plight of their son, Trevor, 30, said in a statement that it has been five days since he was last heard from, in a Friday phone call with his girlfriend.

Trevor Reed is serving a nine-year term after being convicted of endangering the lives of two police officers while drunk on a visit to Moscow in 2019. Reed denied the charges. The United States called his trial a ""theater of the absurd.”

5:12 p.m.: Since the start of Russia’s invasion, millions of Ukrainians have fled their homes, leaving behind animals in shelters and zoos. Now it is up to dozens of volunteers and international groups to care for them. VOA’s Mariia Prus has the story. (Warning: this story contains graphic images that some viewers may find disturbing)

4:44 p.m.: After a sharp plunge in value at the beginning of the war in Ukraine, the Russian ruble has recovered much of its value against other world currencies, a change made possible by aggressive capital controls put in place by the government in Moscow and a continual stream of payments for the country’s oil and gas exports. But as VOA’s Rob Garver reports, the ruble’s strength in the face of sanctions may be illusory.

4:01 p.m.: The Pentagon said on Wednesday it assessed that Ukraine could win the war against Russia, even as U.S. officials speak of the risk of a protracted conflict, Reuters reported. ""Of course they can win this,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told a news briefing. ""The proof is literally in the outcomes that you're seeing everyday ... absolutely they can win.""

3:48 p.m.: The town of Borodyanka, outside Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, was severely damaged by Russian air strikes. According to Prosecutor-General Iryna Venediktova, there were a high number of civilian casualties because of the heavy fighting there. Collapsed buildings have not been cleared and the number of victims has not yet been determined. Levko Stek traveled to Borodyanka and listened to locals’ stories about what Russian troops did there. He has this story for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

3:27 p.m.: Sanctions imposed on Russia over its war in Ukraine should give China a ""good understanding"" of the consequences it could face if it provides material support to Moscow, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said on Wednesday.

Sherman said the ""range of sanctions"" and export controls coordinated among U.S. allies and partners against Russian President Vladimir Putin, the country's economy, and oligarchs, should serve as an example for China's leader Xi Jinping. ""It gives President Xi, I think, a pretty good understanding of what might come his way should he, in fact, support Putin in any material fashion,"" Sherman told a House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, according to Reuters.

3:16 p.m.: Hundreds of people are believed to be dead and buried under destroyed apartment buildings in the town of Borodyanka, scene of Russian bombings during the month of March, The Kyiv Independent reported Wednesday. Home to 12,000 people, Borodyanka and the nearby villages were retaken by Ukrainian forces on April 1, when Russian troops withdrew from the region, following weeks of intense fighting around the capital Kyiv.

2:48 p.m.: Ukraine will need a reconstruction plan after the war with Russia similar to the one the United States offered to Europe after the Second World War, European Budget Commissioner Johannes Hahn said on Wednesday. Under the post-World War Two U.S. scheme known as the Marshall Plan, the United States granted Europe the present-day equivalent of some $200 billion over four years in economic and technical assistance. ""I think that what we need for Ukraine, at the end of the day, is an updated model of the Marshall Plan,"" Hahn told a news briefing. Hahn said it would help Ukraine recover quickly, rather than over decades, from the massive destruction by the Russian army and would lead to a faster convergence of Ukraine with the European Union, Reuters reported.

2:23 p.m.: The Ukrainian Red Cross society distributed 4,200 hygiene kits in the town of Uzhhorod and shared a photo on Twitter Wednesday of one of the families that benefited.

2:06 p.m.: The U.N. General Assembly is set to vote Thursday on whether to remove Russia from the Human Rights Council because of its action in Ukraine. Two-thirds of the 193 member states would have to vote in favor of removing Russia. The council, which is based in Geneva, is largely symbolic, but it can authorize investigations into human rights violations. Russia is in its second year of a three-year term on the council.

1:46 p.m.: Hungary has broken ranks with the European Union, saying it will accept Moscow's demand that gas supplies be paid for in rubles.

Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has opposed any EU sanctions on Russian oil and gas or Western arms shipments through Hungarian territory to Ukraine, told journalists on Wednesday that he had agreed with Russian President Vladimir Putin that if asked, Hungary would pay for gas shipments using the Russian currency. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has the story.

1:28 p.m.: Twelve days before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February, U.S. President Joe Biden urged all U.S. citizens staying or living in Ukraine to immediately leave the country. And though many have, other Americans remain in Ukraine and have no plans to leave. VOA’s Anna Kosstutschenko has the story.

Olympic gold medalist Ruta Meilutyte swam in a red-dyed pond outside the Russian Embassy in Vilnius on Wednesday to protest against Russia’s war in Ukraine, The Associated Press reported. The performance called “Swimming Through” was organized by a local art community. The pond was dyed red with environmentally friendly paint to resemble blood, according to the organizers. “It’s crucial that we keep acting, spreading truthful information, volunteering, protesting, donating, and pressuring our governments to take action,” Meilutyte said on Instagram.



1:05 p.m.: State-owned Ukrainian Railways said on Wednesday there were a number of casualties after three rockets hit a rail station in eastern Ukraine, damaging buildings, tracks and rail stock. ""There are casualties,"" it said in a statement, without providing detail on the number of victims or the location of the attack, Reuters reported.

1:01 p.m.: The governor of Ukraine’s Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said Wednesday that Russia has shelled residential buildings in the area and that 10 high-rise buildings were on fire in Sievierodonetsk, The Kyiv Independent reported. Earlier, Ukrainian authorities had urged civilians to evacuate.

An international agreement under negotiation at the United Nations this week seeks to reduce harm to civilians by curbing the use of heavy explosive weapons in cities, towns and villages, VOA’s Lisa Schlein reported Wednesday. The Ukrainian city of Mariupol is one of the latest examples of a populated area that has been turned to rubble by the relentless use of heavy explosive weapons. The International Network on Explosive Weapons, a coalition of non-governmental activists, says tens of thousands of civilians are killed and wounded every year using explosive weapons in populated areas. It says civilians comprise 90 percent of the victims. Activists are calling on negotiators to set new standards to reduce harm to civilians. They say the new international agreement also should contain commitments to assist the victims and families of those killed and injured, and to address the long-lasting humanitarian impact of explosive weapons.

12:21 p.m.: NATO Spokesperson Oana Longescu said Wednesday that the meeting of foreign ministers focused on Russia’s war in Ukraine is underway.



NATO Foreign Ministers are also expected to discuss the development of NATO’s next Strategic Concept, a roadmap for the Alliance’s continued adaptation in a more dangerous world, she said in a statement. Foreign Ministers from Ukraine, Finland, Sweden, and Georgia are taking part in the meeting, as well as the EU High Representative.

But the grievances he had been voicing since the 1990s found an echo in President Vladimir Putin's increasingly bitter rhetoric in the run-up to the Feb. 24 invasion, when the Kremlin leader repeatedly accused the West of cheating and deceiving Russia.
