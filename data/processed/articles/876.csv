Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, speaking on the eve of a meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels, said the withdrawal of Russian forces from areas around Kyiv is part of a strategy shift for the Kremlin and represents a new phase of the war.

“In the coming weeks, we expect a further Russian push in eastern and southern Ukraine to try to take the entire Donbas and to create a land bridge to occupied Crimea,” Stoltenberg said. “So this is a crucial phase of the war.”

The shift was prompted by Russian President Vladimir Putin’s failure to achieve his initial objective of capturing Kyiv, Stoltenberg said.

Allies will need to ready plans to resupply Ukrainian forces with more weapons in preparation for the upcoming battle in the east, he said.

In the days since Russia has pulled back troops back from towns in the vicinity of Kyiv, scores of dead civilians — some bound and shot at close range — have been observed on streets and buried in ditches. Stoltenberg condemned the scenes, saying Russia was to blame for the atrocities and that those responsible must be held to account.

“We have all seen the horrific images of murdered civilians in Bucha and other places, controlled by the Russian military until a few days ago,” Stoltenberg said. “This is unbearable brutality that Europe has not witnessed in many decades. “

Moscow has denied targeting civilians.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will be among the leaders in Brussels on Wednesday and Thursday for talks, which will center on the types of weaponry allies can hurry into Ukraine as well as how to respond to Russia’s alleged atrocities.

Already, allies have sent in billions of dollars in arms, including anti-tank Javelin systems and Stinger anti-air missiles.

“Allies are determined to provide further support to Ukraine, including anti-tank weapons, air-defense systems and other equipment,” Stoltenberg said.

Allies have a narrow window to get more weapons into Ukraine while Russian troops rearm and resupply in Belarus, he said.

In addition to allied foreign ministers, Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and leaders from Australia, Japan and South Korea are scheduled to join the talks.

“This crisis has global implications, which concerns us all,” Stoltenberg said. “We see that China has been unwilling to condemn Russia’s aggression. … At a time when authoritarian powers are pushing back on the rules-based international order, it is even more important for democracies to stand together.”",https://www.stripes.com/theaters/europe/2022-04-05/nato-stoltenberg-blinken-ukraine-russia-5587365.html

Speaking a day before NATO foreign ministers gather in Brussels to discuss more financial, military and humanitarian support for Ukraine, Stoltenberg said Russia was planning a ""very concentrated"" offensive.

""We now see a significant movement of (Russian) troops away from Kyiv to regroup, re-arm and re-supply and shift their focus to the east,"" Stoltenberg told a news conference.

""In the coming weeks, we expect a further Russian push in eastern and southern Ukraine to try to take the entire Donbas and to create a land bridge to occupied Crimea,"" he said before Wednesday's meeting of NATO foreign ministers.

Stoltenberg's comments appeared to confirm Moscow's announcement in late March that it was refocusing on ""the complete liberation of the Donbas"", an industrial region partly under Russian-backed separatist control since 2014.

Stoltenberg said it would be a new, crucial phase of Russia's Feb. 24 invasion, which the Kremlin calls a ""special military operation"".

""Repositioning of the Russian troops will take some time, some weeks,"" he said.

He said that: ""In that window, it is extremely important that NATO allies provide support"".

Foreign ministers on Wednesday and Thursday are set to discuss how to send more anti-tank weapons, ammunition and medical supplies to Ukraine, Stoltenberg said.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba is expect to attend part of the two-day meeting in Brussels.

Good afternoon.

NATO Foreign Ministers will meet tomorrow and Thursday to address President Putin’s war against Ukraine.

We have all seen the horrific images of murdered civilians in Bucha and other places,

controlled by the Russian military until a few days ago.

This is unbearable brutality that Europe has not witnessed in many decades.

Targeting and murdering civilians is a war crime.

All the facts must be established.

And all those responsible for these atrocities must be brought to justice.

NATO Allies are supporting investigations.

Including through the United Nations, and the International Criminal Court.

The Ukrainian armed forces are putting up fierce resistance.

Retaking territory from the Russian invaders.

And forcing Russia to change its war plans.

But Moscow is not giving up its ambitions in Ukraine.

We now see a significant movement of troops away from Kyiv.

To regroup, rearm and resupply.

And they shift their focus to the east.

In the coming weeks, we expect a further Russian push in eastern and southern Ukraine.

To try to take the entire Donbas and to create a land-bridge to occupied Crimea.

So this is a crucial phase of the war.

And as Ukraine faces this new offensive, NATO Foreign Ministers will discuss what more we will do.

Allies are determined to provide further support to Ukraine.

Including anti-tank weapons, air-defence systems and other equipment.

Allies have also increased humanitarian assistance and financial aid.

NATO will also look to provide cybersecurity assistance.

And equipment to help Ukraine protect against chemical and biological threats.

I expect we will also decide to do more for NATO’s other partners, which are vulnerable to Russian threats and interference.

Including Georgia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

By stepping up our political and practical support, we can help our partners strengthen their resilience.

And prevent any future aggression.

On Thursday, we will be joined by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba.

He will update us on the latest developments, including Kyiv’s negotiations with Moscow.

Finland, Sweden, Georgia, and the European Union will be at the table.

And we will be joined by NATO’s Asia-Pacific partners.

Australia, Japan, New Zealand and the Republic of Korea.

Because this crisis has global implications, which concerns us all.

We see that China has been unwilling to condemn Russia’s aggression.

And has joined Moscow in questioning the right of nations to choose their own path.

At a time when authoritarian powers are pushing back on the rules-based international order, it is even more important for democracies to stand together, and protect our values.

So I expect we will agree to deepen NATO’s cooperation with our Asia-Pacific partners.

Including in areas such as arms control, cyber, hybrid, and technology.

Working more closely together will make us all safer and more secure.

Allies will also discuss our work to develop NATO’s next Strategic Concept in time for the Madrid Summit in June.

It will guide the Alliance as we adapt to a new security reality.

It will address the implications of Russia’s aggressive actions, and our future relationship with Moscow.

For the first time, it will also need to take account of China’s growing influence and coercive policies on the global stage.

Which pose a systemic challenge to our security, and to our democracies.

Our next Strategic Concept must also consider climate change, terrorism, and emerging and disruptive technologies.

At our Summit last year, we agreed to establish a billion euro NATO Innovation Fund.

And a Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic – DIANA.

This week, ministers will endorse the Charter of DIANA, setting out how it will work.

It will include a network of nearly 60 innovation sites in Europe and North America.

Enabling NATO to develop and test new capabilities for our defence.

Altogether, the initial footprint will cover 20 NATO nations.

Representing a true transatlantic endeavour.

And we expect it will continue to expand in the future.

DIANA will work with academia and the private sector, including start-ups and entrepreneurs.

So that Allies, regardless of their size or their location, can harness the best of new technology and keep our people safe.

Our meeting this week is an important milestone as we continue to adapt our Alliance for the future.

And with that, I am ready to take your questions.

NATO Spokesperson Oana Lungescu: Okay, we’ll start with the National News Agency of Ukraine, gentleman in the second row.

Dmytro Shkurko (National News Agency of Ukraine): Dmytro Shkurko, National News Agency of Ukraine. Secretary General by the mass killings and atrocities in the Ukrainian cities, Russian troops absolutely clearly demonstrated what does it mean, Russian policy of denazification, so called. But my question is not about the NATO stance about that. Is there any hope that NATO allies will at least understand that we're some kind of real Nazi regime arising in Russia? And the second part of the question is what NATO really can do to prevent the tragedy of the scale, as we seen during the Second World War. Thanks.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: What we now see with this brutality, is the scale and the scope of war that we haven't seen in Europe since the Second World War. This is extremely serious. It's horrific. And of course it causes suffering for the Ukrainian people. But it's also dangerous for all of us. And we see the nature of President Putin's war, his lack of respect for the rule of law for international rules, and also his lack of respect for basic human rights, including the right to life, for all those who are killed in this conflict. And this is the most serious security challenge we have faced since the Second World War. And it has triggered very comprehensive and strong response from the whole NATO Alliance.

We NATO Allies provide support to Ukraine, and we have provided support Ukraine for many years. NATO allies have trained 10s of 1000s of Ukrainian troops many of whom are now on the front line fighting against the Russian invaders. NATO allies have equipped Ukrainian military for many years and after the invasion allies stepped up and provided even more support. We see the effect of this support every day on the battlefield, because it is first and foremost the bravery, the courage, of Ukrainian soldiers, but of course the help and the equipment they have received from NATO allies have enabled them to put up much more resistance to fight back in a much more effective way than the Russians expected, they totally underestimated the strength of Ukrainian armed forces, and NATO Allies have declared their further support for Ukraine.

Not least in light of the atrocities we have seen in Bucha and other places in Ukraine. So Allies are providing support and as we continue to provide support, because it is absolutely unacceptable what we see President Putin is doing against a sovereign, independent, democratic nation in Europe.

NATO Spokesperson: We’ll go with CNN, first row.

Nic Robertson (CNN): Thank you very much, Nick Robertson, from CNN. President Zelenskyy has said that he will not accept a peace unless all Russian troops leave Ukraine pre-February 23rd lines, can NATO accept a peace that leaves Russian troops in Ukraine beyond their February 23rd possessions?

NATO Secretary General: NATO's Task is to provide support to Ukraine, and we do so with modern military equipment, financial military support, and also humanitarian support. Then it is for the Ukrainian government and for President Zelenskyy and the people of Ukraine to decide what kind of peace arrangements they can accept. We know that there is a very close link between what they can achieve at the negotiating table and their strength on the battlefield. So the stronger we are able to make them on the battlefield, the more support to the more strength we can provide to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the better results they can achieve at the negotiating table.

So it's not for me to give advice, but it's for me and NATO allies to provide them support. And then at the end of the day for the Ukrainian authorities, for the Ukrainian president, and for the Ukrainian people to decide what kind of agreements they can accept. We will never recognise illegally occupied territories. So NATO allies have not recognised illegally annexed Crimea and we will never recognise the illegally occupied territories.

NATO Spokesperson: Al Jazeera.

Step Vaessen (Al Jazeera): Step Vaessen from Al Jazeera English. What we've seen in Bucha is basically we can't conclude anything else than that, despite the fact that NATO has been supporting Ukraine, Ukraine has insisted from the beginning it wasn't enough. We can only conclude that the world and NATO has been watching while these atrocities have been happening in Bucha. Can we now conclude that NATO is ending up at the wrong side of history? That's my first question. And the second one is you say we are increasing our efforts in Ukraine. How are we going to how are you going to prevent that another Bucha will happen in the future, in the next coming weeks when the offences is going to increase? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General: This is President Putin's war, he is responsible. He has made this war by his own choice, and he is responsible for the atrocities, for the casualties, for the whole effects of the war, which are seen everyday taking place on the ground in Ukraine. Then our responsibility is to support the Ukrainians. And we have done that for many years. And the training and equipment NATO allies have provided since 2014, has helped them so they are in a totally different position now than Ukraine was back in 2014 when Russia invaded for the first time.

The Ukrainian Armed Forces are bigger, better equipped, better trained, better led today than in 2014. Not least because of support that our NATO allies have provided for more than eight years. We need to continue to put unprecedented pressure on President Putin and that's the reason why we are on the right side of history because we are standing up for our values. We are imposing unprecedented economic costs on Russia. And we have stepped up and have made it clear and expect our allies when they meet here tomorrow and the day after tomorrow to make clear that they will continue to further support Ukraine with more advanced equipment and military support.

But NATO has also another responsibility, and that is to prevent this conflict from escalating beyond Ukraine, because the suffering we see in Ukraine is horrific. But if this turns in to be a full-fledge war, between a nuclear power, Russia, and NATO, then we will see even more suffering even more death, even more destruction. And that's reason why NATO has to make some hard and difficult decisions to provide support. But to do that in a way that doesn't escalate this conflict into a war that will really be a full-fledged war between NATO and Russia, a nuclear power. And that's a reality we will have to face.

NATO Spokesperson: NPR, Deutsche Welle.

Teri Schultz (NPR/Deutsche Welle): Could you tell me what NATO's assessment is realistically of Russia's capacity to actually launch a chemical or biological or radiological attack? Because you keep warning them against it, and I understand some of this is classified, but there are also experts who say that Russia doesn't have this capacity, and that it's fear mongering to keep talking about the fact that they may launch an attack. So, does the Alliance believe that Russia really could do this in a way that would affect NATO countries?

NATO Secretary General: I'll be careful speculating, but what I would like to say is that it was actually Russia that has started to speak about these types of weapons, because they have accused us, Ukraine, United States, NATO Allies, for preparing the use of biological and chemical weapons. And this is absolutely false. It's has nothing to do with truth whatsoever. And then it has been necessary for us to push back and say that no, NATO and NATO Allies are in no way supporting Ukraine in any way through any use of chemical weapons.

That has been our message, then we have added two more points. And that is that we know that Russia has used chemical agents before, they have used it against their own opposition. They used it in Salisbury, and we have seen that Russia has used chemical weapons and agents before. We also seen that they have supported the Assad regime in Syria, where chemical weapons have been used. But this is first and foremost something that has been brought into the discussion by Russia accusing us for preparing use of chemical weapons which is absolutely wrong, us and Ukraine.

And second, the same thing goes for nuclear weapons, where we have seen the very dangerous nuclear rhetoric from Russia, threatening the use of nuclear weapons as part of the build-up we have seen in and around Ukraine, even before the invasion, but also after.

NATO Spokesperson: Okay, we’ll go to Rustavi.

Tamara Nutsubidze (Rustavi):

Rustavi, Tamara Nutsubidze. In joint statement from the last summit, NATO mentioned we're providing [inaudible] support to partners affected by Russia’s threats and interference and we'll step up our assistance to help them etc. In April, foreign ministers will consider concrete proposals for enhance our support to these partners. So what Georgia could expect from this important meeting tomorrow and the day after tomorrow and also, Georgia will present also new Minister of Foreign Affairs and will represent Georgia in this meeting.

NATO Secretary General: I look forward to meet the new Georgian foreign minister and we always look forward to meet with our highly valued partner Georgia in different NATO meetings tomorrow and in the foreign ministerial meeting, actually the day after on Thursday, and Georgia is a partner which is important for NATO and I expect that the foreign ministers they will look into how we can further step up our support to Georgia and for Georgia This could include increased in our support to the substantial NATO - Georgia package, including the areas of situational awareness, secure communications, resilience, and cyber. We can also support Georgia in developing its own cyber capabilities, and provide additional personnel to the NATO liaison office in Georgia so are concrete steps that can be taken when ministers meet on Thursday.

NATO Spokesperson: We’ll do Politico.

Lili Bayer (POLITICO): Thank you very much, Lili Bayer from Politico. I was wondering if you could perhaps describe in a bit more detail and concretely what are the different options on the table that the ministers will be discussing for further helping Ukraine, Thank you.

NATO Secretary General: So allies will discuss how we can further support Ukraine. This is partly about financial support, partly about humanitarian support, but also of course, partly about military support both non-lethal and lethal military support which allies have provided for several years. I'm a bit careful going into the specific systems, because I think that for operational reasons it is better that Allies actually provide support than that we announce every specific weapon system Allies are transferring over to Ukraine.

But it's well known that we speak about advanced weapon systems, we speak about for instance, javelins and other anti-tank weapons, which have proven extremely effective on the battlefield. If there's anything we have seen is that these relatively light weapons have a huge impact. And when we see all the pictures from the destroyed Russian armour, this is first and foremost the result of these weapons. And of course, the courage of the soldiers who are carrying them. But, I think we have proven the effectiveness of anti-tank weapons delivered by NATO allies.

The Ukrainians have also been able to shoot down advanced Russian planes, but also helicopters. And other drones, again, because of advanced air defence systems delivered by NATO allies, and we are looking into other systems and allies are constantly stepping up and providing more support, partly as weapons, but you know, we also need fuel, you need ammunition, you need a lot of different types of supplies, you need helmets, you need protective gear, you need medical supplies, to run such a big military operation. So this is partly about high end weapon systems, but also very much about the logistics and the supplies you need to run this kind of big military operation as the Ukrainians have run now for several weeks.

NATO Spokesperson: Wall Street Journal.

Dan Michaels (Wall Street Journal): Dan Michaels, with the Wall Street Journal. Thank you very much. If I could follow up on the last question. Mr. Secretary General, as you said at the beginning, it looks like the war is changing. The Russians are regrouping in the south east. They're now more massed. They have more armour from Crimea, from Donbas, it would seem that the battle is going to change qualitatively, it's no longer going to be one where Ukrainians are picking off over extended supply lines or isolated troops. Do the Ukrainians have what they need to fight what may be a more traditional type of ground war against a more massed Russian force, or does NATO need to step up with a different type of weapons system or different type of support to help the Ukrainians against a much more concentrated Russian occupation force? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General: So NATO allies are in close contact with Ukraine and we will also have the Ukrainian foreign minister Kuleba coming to the NATO ministerial meeting. And I expect that he will address the needs that Ukraine have or has to reinforce their troops and to make sure that they continue to push back and to provide fierce resistance against the invading Russian troops. So both the dialogue between different NATO Allies and Ukraine, but also the dialogue we have here at NATO, it's important to make sure that we deliver as much support as we can, and also that we deliver the capabilities that Ukraine needs.

So I expect them meeting tomorrow and the day after tomorrow will provide the platform for that kind of discussions. We are now seeing a new phase of the war, because Russia is really moving out not only of Kyiv but also of most of the North, at least reducing significantly their presence there. Because they failed. President Putin didn't manage to achieve the objectives he set for his military operation. His goal was to take Kyiv within days. Now he has been there for so many weeks. And still has not been able to take Kyiv and many other cities in the north. So he's now moving many of those troops out of the north into Belarus, down to the east into Russia. And there they will be remanned because many have lost a lot of troops in the different units. They will be rearmed because they've used a lot of ammunition and they will be resupplied with fuel and all the things they need, food and so on, to launch a new big offensive.

So what we are expecting is a new very concentrated Russian offensive in Donbas, to try to occupy and take the whole of Donbas. That's also the same area where Ukraine has most of their armed forces. So, this whole build-up will take some time, the repositioning of the Russian troops will take some time, some weeks, but after that, we are afraid that we can see a big Russian offensive in Donbas with the aim to take Donbas. In that window, it is extremely important that NATO Allies provide support. So we are able to rearm, to resupply the Ukrainian forces.

And that's exactly what I expect Allies to do. And what I expect Allies to discuss at the meeting tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, including what types of equipment and how we can enable them to stand up against and continue to inflict heavy casualties on the invading Russian forces.

NATO Spokesperson: Okay, Associated Press.

Mark Carlson (Associated Press): Thanks for your question, Mr. Secretary General, Mark from Associated Press. Has NATO's drones or satellite imagery shown any more locations across Ukraine, where there are mass people that have been killed?

NATO Secretary General: I'm always a bit reluctant to go into details about how we collect intelligence and what kind of detailed information we have but we are monitoring very closely. And we have capabilities, surveillance capabilities that provides us with a lot of information. And this is important and it is something which we use in a good way. Because information, best possible situation awareness is of course, extremely critical in such a dangerous situation as we see in Ukraine now.

NATO Spokesperson: Ok, we have VG.

Alf Bjarne Johnsen (VG): We know there's been talks on high level between NATO, NATO countries and Finland and Sweden for the latest weeks and they have started both a process reviewing whether there will be a membership application. So I wanted to ask you about if you want to comment on the process, and if there has been a discussion with those two countries about intermediate security guarantees for them in a possible intermediate period between an application and a full membership could be granted. Thank you.

NATO Secretary General: It is for Finland and Sweden to decide whether they want to join NATO and NATO will respect the decision they take regardless so whether they decide to try to join or not to join we because we respect decisions by sovereign and independent nations. I have had close contact with the political leadership both in Sweden and Finland over the last months and also the last weeks. And I have conveyed the message that it's for them to decide of course, but if they apply, I expect that 30 Allies will welcome them and that we will find ways to also address the concerns they may have about this interim period between the have applied and until that the last ratification has taken place.

NATO is the strongest alliance in history and by standing together we provide security for all Allies and that we protect values we have in common with Finland and Sweden, democracy, the rule of law, and we live in a more dangerous world. So it's even more important that we stand together. Finland and Sweden are close partners. We have worked with them, trained with them for many, many years.

And we're also now since the invasion actually activated some mechanisms we have to integrate them Finland, Sweden even more into our deliberations and into meetings and activities in NATO. But of course Finland and Sweden are not full members. So they are close partners. We work closely together. But our collective defence guarantees they apply for members and only for members.

NATO Spokesperson: Frankfurter Allgemeine.

Thomas Gutschker (FAZ): Secretary General, the foreign ministers will also discuss the new Strategic Concept and you are entering the drafting phase now. Before the war, you have always described relations between NATO and Russia with the three Ds, deterrence and defence plus dialogue. In the New Strategic Concept, do you see any room for dialogue at all given what has happened in the meantime? And what kind of outlook are you suggesting to allies to contemplate in this drafting process? Thanks a lot.

NATO Secretary General: Our relationship with Russia has fundamentally changed and Russia has walked away from the NATO - Russia Founding Act, the agreement we made to facilitate dialogue between Russia and the NATO back in the 1990s. So this, this doesn't work in the way we've actually tried to achieve the partnership, the cooperation and dialogue we have worked for, for many years with Russia. That doesn't exist anymore. So our relationship with Russia has fundamentally changed.

At the same time, we will need to continue to engage with Russia, because Russia is our neighbour, and we need to also manage a difficult relationship, including issues like risk reduction, transparency, deconfliction, and also issues related to arms control. But meaningful dialogue, as we strived for before, is not an option for Russia, which is so blatantly violating international law, which is using military force against an independent, sovereign nation as Ukraine, and which is responsible for atrocities, for the suffering we see taking place in Ukraine every day.

NATO Spokesperson: NTV.

Gul Sonomut (NTV): Secretary General, Sonomut from NTV Turkey. I have a follow up on the Strategic Concept question. The Strategic Concept has been drafted before the war started in Ukraine. And you said that at the beginning of the war that there is a new reality. Do you think that there is enough time, 11 weeks, by the summit in in June to update again the Strategic Concept? Do you envisage to update also NATO 2030 so that the institution itself, NATO, IS, IMS, could face also the new challenges? And do you, for example, foresee to increase the permanent available troops to SACEUR from 40,000, which is the level today, to 60, 90,000 or at least for the new reality? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General: I'm absolutely confident that when the NATO leaders meet at NATO Summit in Madrid at the end of June, we will be able to agree an updated and good new Strategic Concept. We have started the discussions and of course, we will take into account the Russian invasion of Ukraine as we finalise the Strategic Concept, but I think we have to remember that actually, we predicted precisely based on our intelligence as early as last fall, that it was highly likely that Russia was going to invade Ukraine. So that has been part of our deliberations for many months.

Of course, there is a difference between having intelligence predicting that an invasion will take place, and actually see it takes place as we saw on the 24th of February, but it was not a big surprise. I think it's hardly any other invasion in the world or at least few other invasions we have seen all through history, which has been more predicted than the invasion by Russia into Ukraine. Therefore, also NATO was well prepared. And actually, we have been stepping up since the first Russian invasion of Ukraine back in 2014. Since 2014, since Russia went in and illegally annexed Crimea and destabilised and supported the separatists in Donbas in eastern Ukraine, NATO has implemented the biggest reinforcement in our collective defence in a generation, with battlegroups in the eastern part of the Alliance.

After years of reducing defence spending all Allies have increased defence spending, and we have tripled the size of the NATO Response Force. And actually, the weeks before the invasion, we increased the readiness of the NATO Response Force, we increase the presence of NATO troops in the eastern part of the Alliance, before they invaded. Because we saw the intelligence, we saw the clear warnings about that was most likely going to happen. Then after the invasion, we stepped up further. And now we have 40,000 troops under direct NATO command in the eastern part of the Alliance. There are 100,000 US troops in Europe, a significant increase, and then we have hundreds of 1000s of NATO troops on heightened alert. All of this supported by hundreds of ships and planes, substantial naval, and airpower.

So we have already, since 2014, implemented a huge reinforcement to our collective defence and then on top of that added some immediate responses as a result of the invasion in February. But we face a new security reality. And therefore, we also need to implement some more long term changes to deterrence and defence posture.

And that's what we are asked our military commanders to provide options. We will have those options within some weeks. And then based on the options from the military commanders, we will make decisions on the more longer term reset, on NATO’s deterrence and defence, based on of course what we've already done. And that will be for the leaders to decide in June. But I expect that to be significantly more presence, on land, troops, advanced weapon systems, but also air defence systems, more air presence, at sea, ships, submarines and, in general, to do more to strengthen our collective defence not only with traditional military means, but also cyber, hybrid, space.

So we will see a significant reinforcement. All of this will require more defence spending. And what we see is that Allies started to increase defence spending after 2014, after the invasion this year of Ukraine. We have seen new announcements not least by Germany, but also by other Allies, Italy, Denmark, others, are now stepping up so there will be more funding for more modern equipment. And this is just reflecting the brutal new security reality we face. As long as we stand together 30 allies and invest in our defence we are all safe and secure.

NATO Spokesperson: We’ll take two final quick questions, one here, one online. ZDF, here.

Florian Neuhann (ZDF): Thank you very much. Mr. Stoltenberg, Florian Neuhann from ZDF, German television. First question, Russia is still claiming that the images of Bucha have been doctored. What do you make of these claims and how certain are you that these war crimes have really been committed by Russians? And a second question if I may. On Sunday, Ukrainian president Zelenskyy said it was an historic error of the west, of NATO, not to offer membership to Ukraine. What is your assessment? Was it wrong not to offer membership to Ukraine at the time?

NATO Secretary General: We have seen the atrocities in Bucha, and other places in Ukraine. These atrocities have taken place during a period in which Russia controlled these areas, so they are responsible. Second, we have information from many different sources. And also from open sources, from media, from commercial satellites, and all are telling the same story, that there have been brutal atrocities committed many different places in Ukraine, and that these have taken place in a period where Russia controlled these territories. I'm afraid that that we will see more. That we will see more examples of the killing of civilians, more examples of atrocities, and more examples of targeting the killing of civilians which actually are war crimes.

Because I think we haven't seen everything that has taken place because Russia still controls most of these territories. But when and if they withdraw the troops and Ukraine’s troops take over, I'm afraid they will see more mass graves, more atrocities, and more examples of war crimes. So therefore, it just highlights the importance of a thorough investigation. NATO allies are providing support the UN, to the International Criminal Court, to collect evidence, to preserve evidence, to collect relevant information and to enable them to conduct the thorough investigations and to have a legal process to make sure that all those responsible for these atrocities are held accountable. All facts must be established and we need legal processes.

NATO membership is something which is decided by 30 Allies. […] Allies agreed in 2008, since 2008, NATO allies have provided support to Ukraine. But we have not had consensus on granting membership. I think now after the invasion of Ukraine, we need a discussion in NATO, on how to support and help all the countries in more or less the same situation as Ukraine. Countries that are not member of EU, not member of NATO, but are aspiring to join NATO and or the European Union. And I think one lesson learned from Ukraine is that it's better to provide support sooner than later. So for me, this is a very strong message both when it comes to the need to provide support to Ukraine now. But second also, to really look hard and have a hard look into what can we do for countries like Georgia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina, and others.

NATO Spokesperson: And the final question online, we’ll go to Naomi O’Leary from the Irish Times.

Naomi O’Leary (The Irish Times): Thank you very much for taking my question, Secretary General. Given that we have public declarations from the Russian regime from Mr. Putin Himself and also from state media that the intention is to kill quite a broadly defined group of the Ukrainian population, and we now have evidence of the killings of civilians in areas under Russian control. Does this change anything about what NATO is willing to do to push Russian forces or to help the push of Russian forces out of the areas of Ukraine that are still under Russian control, given the likelihood of further atrocities that you mentioned? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General: We will discuss at the NATO the foreign minister meeting today and tomorrow, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, what more we can do? And I expect to be the discussion about how to provide further military support, what kind of systems, how can we enable the Ukrainians to stand up against invading Russian forces and the support we have already provided has had an obvious impact we see that they are able to actually take out a lot of for instance […] Russian armour and they've been able to actually defeat them and several places and force them to totally change the Russian war plan. They're moving out of Kyiv, the North, to regroup and to move into the East.

So yes, I think we will consider what more we can do. But at the same time, our allies agree that we should not send NATO troops into Ukraine. And we should not send NATO planes into Ukrainian airspace. And that's because we also have the responsibility to prevent a war between Russia and NATO. That will cause more deaths, more destruction, and even more dangers. So yes, we will discuss how we can further support, what more we can do to support Ukraine, including what kind of costs, additional costs, we can put on Russia. I welcome that allies are discussing more sanctions, but I don't expect any Ally to be in favour of sending NATO troops into Ukraine.

NATO Spokesperson: Thank you very much. This concludes this press conference.

NATO Secretary General: Thank you.",https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_194325.htm

NATO ministers this week will consider how to boost support for Ukraine as Russia pivots to an expected offensive in the country’s east, Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday.

Speaking ahead of a meeting of the Western military alliance’s foreign ministers, Stoltenberg said that while Russia is moving back some of its troops around the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, “Moscow is not giving up its ambitions in Ukraine.”

“We now see a significant movement of troops away from Kyiv — to regroup, rearm and resupply, and they shift their focus to the east,” the secretary-general told reporters.

“In the coming weeks,” Stoltenberg said, “we expect a further Russian push in the eastern and southern Ukraine to try to take the entire Donbas and to create a land bridge to occupied Crimea,” a portion of Ukraine that Russia annexed in 2014.

“This is a crucial phase of the war,” he added.

NATO ministers, who are scheduled to meet in Brussels on Wednesday and Thursday, will discuss how to best assist Kyiv through that phase. Joining part of the discussion will be Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, as well as partners from non-NATO countries Finland, Sweden and Georgia. The EU and Asia-Pacific partners from Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea will also participate.

The meeting comes amid growing outrage over the Russian military’s atrocities in Ukraine, with concern deepening about the targeting of civilians in areas under Moscow’s control.

Stoltenberg referred to the murder of civilians as “unbearable brutality that Europe has not witnessed in many decades,” stressing that “targeting and murdering civilians is a war crime.”

NATO allies, he said, “are determined to provide further support to Ukraine, including anti-tank weapons, air-defense systems and other equipment.” Stoltenberg declined to offer details, citing operational security but indicated it would include more of the same equipment.

“These relatively light weapons have a huge impact,” he said.

Ukrainians have been able to shoot down Russian planes, helicopters and drones “because of advanced air-defense systems delivered by NATO allies,” Stoltenberg said. Beyond weapons, the secretary-general noted, Ukraine needs fuel, ammunition, helmets, protective gear and medical supplies.

As Russia prepares for its next offensive, Stoltenberg implored allies to lend a hand to Kyiv.

“The repositioning of the Russian troops will take some time, some weeks,” he said. “But after that, we’re afraid that we can see a big Russian offensive in Donbas.”

“In that window,” Stoltenberg added, “it is extremely important that NATO allies provide support.”",https://www.politico.eu/article/nato-ministers-to-plot-more-ukraine-support-as-russia-regroups/

Spurred by reports of Russian atrocities outside Ukraine’s capital, and alarmed at signs that Russia’s invasion force is about to escalate assaults in eastern Ukraine, many civilians in that region are fleeing while they can, officials said Wednesday.

“The cities of the Luhansk region are in ruins,” warned one eastern governor. “Thousands of residents have not yet left. Get out of the way!”

The exodus accelerated as Western nations moved to provide more weapons to Ukraine’s military and further ostracize Russia economically with new sanctions, including restrictions on its leading banks and on the assets of President Vladimir V. Putin’s children.

The new sanctions are a response to outrage and revulsion over the atrocities, including executions and torture, that appear to have been carried out by Russian forces before they retreated from areas outside Kyiv in the past few weeks. Russia has denied responsibility, saying the atrocities were fabricated or were committed by the Ukrainians themselves.

The European Union also was weighing a ban on coal from Russia, the leading provider of fossil-fuel energy to Europe, and Russia appeared to move closer to default on its foreign debt because of U.S. currency restrictions.

“Together with our allies and our partners, we’re going to keep raising the economic costs and ratchet up the pain for Putin, and further increase Russia’s economic isolation,” said President Biden, who has described Mr. Putin as a war criminal and suggested he should not remain in power.

More than 11 million Ukrainians — roughly one in four — have fled their homes since the Feb. 24 invasion, according to the United Nations, including more than four million who have fled the country. It is the biggest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.

The Russian military announced last week that it would focus its campaign on eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting for eight years. The redeployment came as the Russians, hampered by botched planning and fierce Ukrainian military resistance, retreated from the Kyiv area and apparently abandoned — at least for now — any effort to capture the capital in their war to subjugate the former Soviet republic.

Western military analysts have said the Russians vastly underestimated the challenges in Ukraine and that their initial invasion force of more than 150,000 has been weakened by losses, exhaustion and low morale. But that does not mean Russia’s military cannot undertake a powerful new assault in eastern Ukraine.

The shift has accelerated civilian displacement in the east. Thousands of people have been leaving, according to Ukrainian officials, and photos and videos posted online. Ukrainian officials say Russian troops have been massing in the Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv regions.

In Kramatorsk, a city in the north of the Donetsk region, photos showed crowds of people huddled at a platform in a central train station.

At least two people were killed and five injured when Russian forces launched a strike on a humanitarian aid site in the town of Vugledar in the Donetsk region, according to Pavlo Kyrylenko, the Donetsk governor.

Russian forces now control 60 percent of the town of Rubizhne, in the Luhansk region, according to the governor there, Serhiy Haidai, who said the attackers had scaled up their offensive this week.

“Evacuations are taking place under the roar of enemy guns,” Mr. Haidai wrote in a Facebook post on Wednesday, saying that approximately 30,000 people had left the region since Russia invaded. He urged remaining residents to flee before Russia scaled up attacks.

Oleg Synegubov, the state administrator for the Kharkiv military region, said Wednesday in a post on Telegram that the army would evacuate two towns in the eastern part of the country because fighting was escalating there.

The towns, Lozova and Barvinkove, are southwest of Izium, a city Russian forces seized as part of an apparent drive toward Sloviansk, which military analysts say is strategically critical to Russia’s plan to gain full control of eastern Ukraine.

Earlier this week, Oleksiy Danilov, the head of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, speaking on national television, said “large groupings of Russian troops” had been massing in the region.

“They are not going to stop,” he said. “They have a great desire to create big problems for our armed forces in this direction, and we also expect that fierce battles will be fought there for our territory in the near future.”

The Pentagon’s assessment of Russian deployments appeared to corroborate what Ukrainian officials were saying. Pentagon officials said Russia had withdrawn all of its troops arrayed against Kyiv and another city in the north, Chernihiv, and sent them back to Russia or to its ally Belarus to rearm, resupply and possibly redeploy in eastern Ukraine.

The Pentagon officials said those forces included as many as 40,000 troops that, in many cases, had departed under fierce attack from the Ukrainian military units that retook the territory.

“We believe they are all out,” one senior Pentagon official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential operational issues.

Russia now has about 30 battalion tactical groups — as many as 30,000 troops — in the east, the senior Pentagon official said. Earlier this week, Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden’s national security adviser, said Russia would most likely send “tens of thousands of soldiers to the front line in Ukraine’s east” in the coming weeks.

Largely in anticipation of this next major phase of the war, the Pentagon announced late Tuesday that it was sending $100 million worth of Javelin anti-tank missiles — roughly several hundred missiles — to Ukraine, where the weapon has been used with high success in destroying Russian tanks and other armored vehicles.

NATO foreign ministers, meeting this week, have been discussing how to further help Ukraine prosecute the war without entangling the alliance in direct combat with Russian forces.

The war, they said, is far from over, noting that however badly Russia’s forces have performed, and their retreat from areas around Kyiv notwithstanding, they are making slow and brutal progress in the east.

“Moscow is not giving up its ambitions in Ukraine,” said Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary general.

Ukrainian officials in a number of areas, including Mykolayiv in the south and the Luhansk and Donetsk regions in the east, have been sharing schedules of planned evacuations or links to online portals for people to sign up to join buses and trains that are transporting residents to safer places.

But in some besieged cities in the south, like Mariupol, it is already nearly impossible to leave, making evacuations sporadic and risky.

Attempts by the Red Cross to enter Mariupol to supervise civilian departures have repeatedly been scrubbed, leaving fearful residents to fend for themselves. On Wednesday, 500 people who had escaped Mariupol to join a Red Cross convoy in the nearby city of Berdyansk arrived in Zaporizhzhia, about 100 miles away.

The climate of fear gripping Mariupol has spread to the region of Kherson, near the Black Sea, where people have lived under occupation by Russian forces since they encircled and entered the city and its suburbs on March 2.

“Anyone who did not leave early is now stuck here,” said Evgeniya Selivantseva, a doctor from Velyka Lepetyka, a village on the Dnipro River, in the Kherson region.

Dr. Selivantseva, 38, described a deepening humanitarian crisis in the village: Gasoline stations have run out of fuel, and food and medical supplies are running low. Food is so scarce that local leaders have started a makeshift flour mill.

“We feel helpless and totally defenseless,” she said. “People are afraid to leave their homes.”

The proposed European Union ban on Russian coal, part of the bloc’s effort to further penalize Russia over atrocities in Ukraine, reflected a choice of an imported energy source that would be the easiest to replace.

Deliberations over the ban and other sanctions were set to continue into Thursday, and European Union officials and diplomats anticipated that the measures would be approved. The process reflected the challenges of reaching agreement among all 27 member nations on the penalties, which would also include banning Russian ships from E.U. ports.

If approved, the sanctions would be the harshest enforced by the bloc since the invasion.

Though the European Union depends on Russian coal, the bloc could find substitute imports more easily than for natural gas and oil.

But banning coal from Russia could send energy prices soaring for European consumers, given the existing shortages in the bloc, according to Rystad Energy, a consulting firm. Carlos Torres Diaz, a senior vice president at Rystad, called the potential sanctions “a double-edged sword.”

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

On Tuesday, NATO said Russia will likely launch that ""concentrated effort"" in the next few weeks.

Russia will likely launch a new ""concentrated"" offensive in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region in the next few weeks, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said during a press conference on Tuesday.

""We now see a significant movement of (Russian) troops away from Kyiv to regroup, re-arm and re-supply and shift their focus to the east,"" Stoltenberg said.

He added: ""In the coming weeks we expect a further Russian push in the east and southern Ukraine, to try to take the entire Donbas and to create a land bridge to the occupied Crimea.""

Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 with the help of Moscow-backed separatists. Days before his invasion of Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin also recognized the two separatist regions of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has previously said that the world's reaction to Putin in 2014, led to the current invasion.

""It is often said that unpunished evil returns,"" Zelenskyy said in a virtual address to Australia's parliament. ""I would add — unpunished evil returns winged, with a sense of omnipotence.""

Russia faced condemnation and sanctions following the 2014 invasion of Crimea and was kicked out of the G8 group of world leaders.

""If the world had punished Russia for what it did in 2014, there would be none of the horrors of this invasion of Ukraine in 2022,"" Zelenskyy said. ""We need to fix these terrible mistakes now.""

In late March Sergei Rudskoi, a senior Russian military leader said the first part of the war in Ukraine was over and troops would now focus on ""the liberation of Donbas,"" which he said was the ""main goal.""

Stoltenberg said that repositioning Russian troops could take weeks, and in the meantime, it's important for NATO allies to ""provide support"" for Ukraine.

Ukrainian forces have been fighting Kremlin-backed rebels in the Donbas region since 2014, the same year Russia unilaterally annexed Crimea. Moscow annexed Crimea and began its involvement in the Donbas after a pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych, was ousted as Ukraine's leader after mass protests.

Even before Russia launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in late February, the Donbas conflict had claimed over 13,000 lives. The Kremlin-backed rebels also controlled roughly one-third of the Donbas.

In the days leading up to Russia's so-called ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized the independent of Donetsk and Luhansk — two separatist territories in the Donbas region. Putin also backed the rebel's claims to the territory of the Donbas not yet under their control.

Though Russia is apparently moving toward focusing much of its energy on the Donbas for now, experts have expressed skepticism that Putin will ever give up on his broader goal of dominating and subjugating all of Ukraine.",https://www.businessinsider.com/nato-expect-russia-try-and-take-over-entire-donbas-region-2022-4

4:32 am: Pentagon says Putin has given up on taking Kyiv but ‘significant battle’ still ahead for southeastern Ukraine

US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Thursday that Russian President Vladimir Putin has given up on conquering Kyiv after his forces were soundly beaten back by the Ukrainian military.

“Putin thought that he could very rapidly take over the country of Ukraine, very rapidly capture this capital city. He was wrong,” Austin told a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee in Congress.

“I think Putin has given up on his efforts to capture the capital city and is now focused on the south and east of the country,” said Austin.

But the path of the overall war, six weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine, remains uncertain, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, told the same hearing.

For Ukraine to “win” the fight, it needs to remain a free and independent nation, with its recognised territory intact, he said.

“That’s going to be very difficult. That’s going to be a long slog,” Milley said.

“The first part of it has probably been successfully waged,” he said of the war that began on February 24.

“But there is a significant battle yet ahead down in the southeast, down around the Donbas region where the Russians intend to mass forces and continue their assault,” he said.

“So I think it’s an open question right now, how this ends.”

1:58 am: EU approves Russia coal embargo, proposes more arms to Ukraine

The European Union on Thursday said it had approved an embargo on Russian coal and the closing of the bloc’s ports to Russian vessels over the Ukraine war.

An official from the French presidency of the European Council said the moves spearhead a “very substantial” fifth round of sanctions against Moscow.

That package also includes a 10 billion euro ($10.9 billion) ban on exports to Russia, including high-tech goods, and the freezing of several Russian banks’ assets.

In addition to the sanctions, the EU also backed a proposal to boost its funding of arms supplies to Ukraine by 500 million euros, taking it to a total of 1.5 billion euros.

European Council President Charles Michel said on Twitter the package would be “swiftly approved”.

Thanks and support to @JosepBorrellF for your proposal to top up the #EuropeanPeaceFacility with a further €500M. Once swiftly approved this will bring to 1.5 billion the EU support already provided for military equipment for #Ukraine. @ZelenskyyUa — Charles Michel (@eucopresident) April 7, 2022

The new financial measures were proposed by the European Commission after the bodies of dozens of civilians were found last weekend in Bucha, near Kyiv.

It is the first time the Europeans have targeted the Russian energy sector, on which they are heavily dependent.

The EU nations import 45 percent of their coal from Russia, worth 4 billion euros a year.

The embargo will come into force at the beginning of August, 120 days after the publication of the new package in the EU’s official journal, expected on Friday.

1:28 am: WHO confirms over 100 attacks on health facilities in Ukraine

The World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday said it had confirmed over 100 attacks on health services in Ukraine, as it called for humanitarian access to the besieged city of Mariupol.

“As of now, WHO has verified 103 incidents of attacks on health care, with 73 people killed and 51 injured, including health workers and patients,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press conference, calling it a “grim milestone.”

Of the confirmed attacks, 89 had impacted health facilities and most of the rest hit transport services, including ambulances.

“We are outraged that attacks on health care are continuing,” the WHO chief said, adding they constituted “a violation of international humanitarian law.”

Speaking at an earlier press conference in Lviv, WHO regional director for Europe Hans Kluge lamented that while health assistance had reached many “affected areas”, some were still out of reach.

“It’s true some remain very difficult. I think a priority definitely, I think we all agree, would be Mariupol,” Kluge told reporters.

April 8, 12:10 am: Canada to offer up to C$1 bn in new financing to Ukraine

Canada will offer Ukraine up to C$1 billion ($794 million) in new loan resources via the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and provide an additional C$500 million in military aid, the Liberal government said on Thursday.

The announcements in the federal budget mean Canada has now committed more than C$1.2 billion in direct contributions to Ukraine, as well as offering up to C$1.6 billion in loan supports.

“This support has helped respond to the humanitarian crisis, and ensure that the Ukrainian government can continue to provide essential services,” the budget said.

Canada will offer up to C$1 billion in new loan resources to Kyiv through a new Administered Account for Ukraine at the IMF.

Since 2015, Canadian troops have been training Ukrainian forces in the west of the country. In January, Ottawa said the mission would be expanded.

Canada, which has announced more than C$90 million in lethal and non-lethal weaponry to Ukraine so far, said on Thursday it proposed to provide an additional $500 million in the 2022-23 fiscal year to provide further military aid.

Russian journalist and Nobel Peace prize laureate Dmitry Muratov was Thursday assaulted on a train by a person who sprayed him with paint, his newspaper Novaya Gazeta reported.

“An unknown assailant attacked the chief editor of Novaya Gazeta and Nobel prize winner in a train coach,” the independent publication said via Telegram.

“He threw oil-based paint mixed with acetone into the compartment. He shouted, ‘Muratov, that’s for our boys’,” the paper quoted Muratov as saying, in apparent allusion to Russian casualties in the Ukraine war.

“My eyes are burning terribly. I am going to try to wash it off,” Muratov was quoted as saying after the attack on a train headed from Moscow to the southeastern city of Samara.

Aboard a train to Samara, somebody attacked Nobel Peace Prize laureate and Novaya Gazeta editor-in-chief Dmitry Muratov with red paint laced with the solvent acetone. “This is for our boys!” the assailant shouted.

Ukraine's Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova on Thursday said 26 bodies had been found under two ruined buildings in the Kyiv region town of Borodianka, which is been being searched by the authorities after Russian troops occupying it withdrew.

In a televised briefing, Venediktova did not say if the authorities had established the cause of death, but she accused Russian troops of carrying out air strikes on the town before they seized control of it.

""Borodianka is the worst in terms of destruction and in terms of the uncertainty about (the number of) victims,"" she said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday urged Cyprus to revoke passports issued to Russians through an investment scheme and stop private yachts docking in its marinas. Zelensky made the plea during an address to the Cypriot parliament via live video link, the latest in a series of such speeches he has made to foreign legislatures after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""I'm grateful to you for your moral stance. You reacted to the Russian invasion and banned the docking of Russian ships in your ports,"" Zelensky said.

7:53 pm: Kremlin says Russia has suffered 'significant losses' in Ukraine

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that Russia had sustained ""significant losses"" in Ukraine, which its troops entered on February 24 in what it calls a ""special military operation"".

Russia's defence ministry said on March 25, its most recent update, that 1,351 Russian soldiers had been killed since the start of the campaign, and 3,825 had been wounded.

7:06 pm: Russia says it would have to 'rebalance' if Finland and Sweden join NATO

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that if Finland and Sweden joined NATO then Russia would have to ""rebalance the situation"" with its own measures.

Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, which it says aims among other things to degrade Ukraine's military potential and prevent it becoming a bridgehead for a NATO attack, has prompted the two Nordic countries to consider joining the US-led alliance.

If the two countries join, ""we'll have to make our western flank more sophisticated in terms of ensuring our security"", Peskov told Britain's Sky News.

7:02 pm: 'We must assume' Russians committing more atrocities in Ukraine, Blinken says

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday it is likely that Russian forces are carrying out more ""atrocities"" in parts of Ukraine after bodies were found in the town of Bucha.

""For every Bucha there are many more towns Russia has occupied and more towns that it is still occupying, places where we must assume Russian soldiers are committing more atrocities right now,"" Blinken told journalists after meeting foreign ministers from NATO and Ukraine in Brussels. He said the US had warned ahead of Russia's invasion that part of the Kremlin's ""campaign plan was to inflict atrocities, was to target individuals, was to commit the kinds of crimes that we're now seeing to terrorise civilian populations"".

""And so this, as we saw it, was part of the game plan all along,"" he said.

Ukraine has received about 25,000 anti-aircraft weapons systems from the United States and its allies, helping Kyiv prevent Russia from establishing air superiority that would have aided Moscow's ground invasion, the top U.S. general said on Thursday.

Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the United States and its allies had also supplied Ukraine with 60,000 anti-tank systems. ""The Ukrainians ... are very, very thankful, extraordinarily thankful,"" Milley told the Senate Armed Services Committee.

When Ukraine's foreign minister entered this summit this morning, he said Ukraine needs three things: weapons, weapons, and weapons. So are they getting all the weapons that they want? That's what we're going to see here today. But we have very strong words there from the [NATO] Secretary-General Stoltenberg that they understand the gravity of the situation.""

5:21 pm: German intelligence service has radio intercepts on Bucha killings

German intelligence services have intercepted radio traffic of Russian soldiers discussing the killings of civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, Spiegel reported Thursday, in what would be new evidence linking Moscow troops to the deaths.

Some of the audio material collected appears to relate to victims found dead along a main street in Bucha, the magazine said, citing a closed-door parliamentary briefing given by Germany's foreign intelligence service BND. Among the intercepts was a soldier's description of how he and his platoon mates shot a person on a bicycle.

5:21 pm: Ukraine using landmines effectively against Russia, US general says

Ukraine is effectively using landmines in the conflict with Russia, forcing Russian armored vehicles into engagement areas where they are vulnerable to US-supplied anti-tank weaponry, the top US general told a Senate hearing on Thursday.

""That's one of the reasons why you see column after column of Russian vehicles that are destroyed. So anti-tank or anti-personnel mines are very effective,"" Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee.

4:43 pm: After Kyiv win, Ukraine still faces significant battle in southeast, US general says

Ukrainian forces have successfully managed to counter Russia's attempt to take Kyiv but a significant battle is still ahead in the southeast of the country, the top US general said on Thursday.

4:42 pm: Conquering Mariupol will 'take time', pro-Russian separatist official says

A pro-Russian separatist official in eastern Ukraine said Thursday it was impossible to say how long it could take Moscow's forces to fully seize the besieged city of Mariupol.

Mariupol, located in the country's southeast between Russia-occupied Crimea and pro-Russian separatist regions in Ukraine's east, has been the scene of some of the fiercest fighting.

Most recently, fighting has centred around the city's Azovstal iron and steel works and port, said Eduard Basurin, a senior official in the self-proclaimed breakaway stronghold of Donetsk. In televised remarks, he described Mariupol's industrial zone as a ""city within a city"".

3:51 pm: Novaya Gazeta opens outlet in Europe after suspending activities in Russia

Russian journalists from investigative paper Novaya Gazeta said on Thursday they were launching a new media outlet in Europe after their paper suspended its activities over warnings it received from the authorities.

Novaya Gazeta, whose editor-in-chief Dmitry Muratov was co-winner of last year's Nobel Peace Prize, was among the liberal Russian media facing increased pressure in the wake of Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine.

Last month, the paper said it could no longer operate in Russia after receiving warnings from communications watchdog Roskomnadzor for failing to properly identify an organisation deemed a ""foreign agent"" by the authorities in its publications.

3:23 pm: Ukraine dismisses Russian criticism of Kyiv over peace talks as propaganda

Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak dismissed comments by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday suggesting Kyiv had presented it with a draft peace deal that deviated from proposals both sides had previously agreed on.

Podolyak told Reuters in a written statement that Lavrov was not directly involved in negotiations and his statements were ""of purely propagandistic significance"". Podolyak said Moscow wanted to divert attention from events in the town of Bucha, where Ukraine accuses Russian troops of killing civilians, and added: ""That is how any such statements should be regarded.""

2:36 pm: Russia accuses Ukraine of changing demands since Istanbul talks

Russia on Thursday accused Ukrainian negotiators of changing demands since last month's talks in Istanbul, claiming that Kyiv was not interested in ending fighting.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that on Wednesday the Ukrainian side had presented its draft agreement. ""It shows a departure from the most important provisions spelled out at the meeting in Istanbul on March 29,"" he said.

In Turkey, ""the Ukrainians clearly stated that future (international) security guarantees for Ukraine do not apply to Crimea and Sevastopol,"" Lavrov said, referring to territory Moscow annexed in 2014.

2:35 pm: WHO says making contingency plans for possible 'chemical assaults'

The World Health Organisation's European head said on Thursday that the body was preparing for possible ""chemical assaults"" in Ukraine, in a sign it is taking warnings that have emerged from both the West and Moscow seriously.

9:38 am: Ukraine urges Hungary to 'get on the right side of history' over Russia

Ukraine said on Thursday that Hungary's position that it is prepared to pay in roubles for Russian gas was an ""unfriendly"" stance that was destroying the unity of the European Union over Russia's invasion.

""If Hungary really wants to help end the war, here's how to do it: stop destroying unity in the EU, support new anti-Russian sanctions, provide military assistance to Ukraine, and not create additional sources of funding for Russia's military machine. It is never too late to get on the right side of history,"" Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko said.

6:05 am: Ukraine girds for renewed Russian offensive on eastern front

Ukraine braced for a climactic battle for control of the besieged country's industrial east, as Russian forces withdrew from the shattered outskirts of Kyiv to regroup and intensify their offensive across the Donbas region, where authorities urged people to evacuate before time runs out.

The mayor of the southern port city of Mariupol said Wednesday that more than 5,000 civilians had been killed there. Meanwhile, in areas north of the capital, Ukrainian officials gathered evidence of Russian atrocities amid telltale signs that Moscow’s troops killed people indiscriminately before retreating over the past several days.

In his nightly address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that the Russian military continued to build up its forces in preparation for a new offensive in the east, where the Kremlin has said its goal is to “liberate” the Donbas, Ukraine’s mostly Russian-speaking industrial heartland. But he said Ukraine, too, was preparing for battle.

“We will fight and we will not retreat,” he said. “We will seek all possible options to defend ourselves until Russia begins to seriously seek peace. This is our land. This is our future. And we won’t give them up.”

5:30 am: US Senate to vote on revoking Russia's trade status, oil ban

The US Senate will take up legislation Thursday to end normal trade relations with Russia and to ban the importation of its oil. Both bills have been bogged down in the Senate, frustrating lawmakers who want to ratchet up the US response to Russia’s war with Ukraine.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Russian President Vladimir Putin needs to be held accountable for what Schumer said were war crimes against Ukraine.

The trade suspension measure paves the way for US President Joe Biden to enact higher tariffs on certain Russian imports. The bill banning Russian oil would codify restrictions Biden has already put in place through executive action.

With Russian hopes for storming Kyiv and other major cities in northern Ukraine dashed by stiff resistance , Moscow has refocused its efforts on the country’s east, seeking to make gains there and use them to dictate its terms in talks on ending the conflict.

The Russian troops are preparing for a massive offensive in Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland known as the Donbas, and the coming weeks could determine the outcome of the war.

A look at the shift in the Russian strategy and its possible consequences.

A STALLED BLITZ

When Russian forces invaded Ukraine from the north, east and south on Feb. 24. President Vladimir Putin counted on a quick victory, similar to its 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula.

The Russian troops that pushed into Ukraine from Moscow’s ally Belarus quickly reached the outskirts of Kyiv, only 75 kilometers (47 miles) south of the border, but they got bogged down facing Ukrainian defenses.

After the failed attempts to storm the capital and other big cities in the north, Russian forces tried to encircle and pummel them with artillery and airstrikes. The relentless barrages led to massive civilian casualties and damaged infrastructure, but didn’t weaken Ukraine’s resolve. Ukrainian forces, meanwhile, successfully used artillery and drones against Russian convoys that stretched for dozens of kilometers (miles) along highways outside Kyiv. That created massive logistical problems for the Russians.

A SHIFT IN STRATEGY

On March 29, Russia announced a drastic change in strategy, saying it would scale down military activities around Kyiv and Chernihiv, focusing instead on the “liberation” of Donbas.

A quick withdrawal from areas in the north and northeast followed, with forces pulling back to Belarus and Russia for rest and resupply.

Moscow sought to put a positive spin on what Ukrainian and Western officials described as the failure of the offensive. Russia said the action in the north was intended to tie down and weaken Ukrainian forces there and prevent them from joining troops engaged in the fighting in the east.

REDEPLOYMENT AND REGROUPING

Observers said it could take Russian troops several weeks for the troops to rest, resupply and regroup before they could launch a new attack in the east.

“Many Russian units withdrawing from northern Ukraine are likely to require significant re-equipping and refurbishment before being available to redeploy for operations in eastern Ukraine,” a tweet from the British Ministry of Defence said.

Some Western estimates said nearly a quarter of Russian units involved in the fighting had been rendered unfit for further action and would need long reequipment and resupply before being sent back into combat.

“They will be remanned because they have lost a lot of troops in the different units,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said. “They will be rearmed because they have used a lot of ammunition and they will be resupplied ... to launch a new big offensive.”

FORTRESS EAST

The separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine, home to a mostly Russian-speaking population, began in 2014 shortly after the annexation of Crimea and has killed over 14,000 people. The fighting has tempered Ukrainian forces, which have gained ample combat experience and built multilayered defenses along the line of contact.

Those efforts paid off at the start of the Russian invasion, preventing the separatist forces and Russian troops from making any significant gains there despite far superior firepower.

From the start of the invasion, Moscow’s key goal was to capture the Sea of Azov port of Mariupol to secure a coastal corridor to Crimea. Russian troops have besieged Mariupol for a month, reducing much of the city to rubble with artillery and air raids that killed thousands. So far, however, they have failed to win full control.

RUSSIAN PINCER MOVEMENT

Ukrainian and Western officials say the Russian plan is to encircle tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops in Donbas by moving from Izyum, near Kharkiv in the north, and from Mariupol in the south.

The timing for the offensive depends on how quickly the Russians wrap up the battle for Mariupol and free those forces for the offensive. It also will depend on how much time is needed to resupply and regroup the troops that were pulled back from Kyiv and other areas in the north.

The Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said in an analysis that the Russian troops will likely try to advance from Izyum to capture the strategic city of Slovyansk and link up with other Russian forces in Donbas in what it said “will likely prove to be the next pivotal battle of the war in Ukraine.”

Stoltenberg warned that such an eastward shift by Russia marks a “crucial phase of the war,” saying a further push in eastern and southern Ukraine is expected ”to try to take the entire Donbas and to create a land bridge to occupied Crimea.”

MOSCOW’S VULNERABILITIES

During an eastern offensive, Russian forces will face the same problems that hampered their attack in the north.

Maintaining supply lines over long distances under constant Ukrainian attacks was a key challenge that eventually doomed the blitz on Kyiv and forced Moscow’s retreat. Such an operation in the east could prove just as hard.

The lack of proper cohesion among different forces, the failure to fully suppress Ukrainian air defenses, and the growing popular resistance to the invasion would likely make it difficult for quick Russian gains in the east. As they seek to encircle Ukrainian troops in Donbas, Russian forces could also face attacks on their flanks.

CONDITIONS FOR PEACE

A military success in the east could offer Putin a face-saving exit from the conflict, allowing him to claim that Moscow’s main goals were fulfilled. He could argue that Russia has destroyed the bulk of the Ukrainian military, liquidated the “neo-Nazi nationalist” forces and “liberated” Donbas.

Putin’s conditions for peace, however, include a demand for Ukraine to acknowledge Russia’s sovereignty over Crimea and to recognize the independence of the eastern separatists regions, something that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has rejected. Zelenskyy said the issues of Crimea and Donbas could be put on hold, but Moscow wants to make them part of a deal now.

TIME AS A FACTOR

Putin badly needs a quick success in the east to find a way out of the conflict that increasingly looks like a quagmire for Moscow. Time is working against Russia, with each day of war worsening the massive economic damage from Western sanctions and draining its limited resources.

A protracted conflict could force the Kremlin to broadly engage the use of poorly trained conscripts, something it has tried to avoid, claiming that it relies squarely on volunteer soldiers. Sending fresh draftees into battle would be highly unpopular and likely fuel public discontent.

Putin’s goal of freeing Ukraine from purported “neo-Nazis” has led some observers to predict that he hopes for quick gains in the east so he can announce a successful end to the campaign by May 9. That’s when Russia celebrates its victory over Nazi Germany in World War II, its most important public holiday.
