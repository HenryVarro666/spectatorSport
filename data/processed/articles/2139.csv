Ukraine has cut all diplomatic ties with Russia after President Vladimir Putin authorised an all-out invasion of Ukraine by land, air and sea.

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced the country would break diplomatic relations with Moscow in response to Russia’s invasion of its Western-backed neighbour.

It marked the first rupture in ties since Russia and Ukraine became independent countries after the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991.

“We broke off diplomatic relations with Russia,” Zelenskyy said in a video message on Thursday.

“Ukraine is defending itself and will not give up its freedom, no matter what Moscow thinks. Russia vilely and suicidally attacked our state in the morning. Just like fascist Germany did during the second world war.”

Ukraine and Russia maintained ties throughout a complex history of relations that included two pro-Western revolutions in Kyiv in 2004 and 2014 that the Kremlin strongly opposed.

Zelenskyy’s decision came hours after Putin launched an all-out offensive that included an air assault and ground invasions along Ukraine’s northern and southern frontiers.

The attacks began after Putin said in a televised address that he had approved a “special military operation”.

The move came after Moscow earlier recognised rebel-held territories in Luhansk and Donetsk and said they had asked for its “help”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/24/ukraine-breaks-diplomatic-ties-with-russia

Zelensky made the announcement as an adviser said that over 40 Ukrainian soldiers had died in the assault and several more had been wounded, notes the Times.

The Ukrainian president also put a statement on Twitter, condemning Russia’s attacks and linking them to Nazi Germany’s actions in World War II.

“Russia treacherously attacked our state in the morning, as Nazi Germany did in #2WW years. As of today, our countries are on different sides of world history. [Russia] has embarked on a path of evil, but [Ukraine] is defending itself & won’t give up its freedom no matter what Moscow thinks,” tweeted Zelensky.

Russia began a military assault in Ukraine early Thursday, while Russian forces struck Ukraine with missile attacks across the country, far past the separatist regions that Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed he sought to defend, including the capital city, Kyiv.

Putin announced that Russia began a “special military operation” and claimed that it was in defense of the separatist regions of Ukraine and that he was seeking the “demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine.”

The Russian leader also threatened allies that may come to the aid of Ukraine, saying, “Anyone who tries to interfere with us, or even more so, to create threats for our country and our people, must know that Russia’s response will be immediate and will lead you to such consequences as you have never before experienced in your history. We are ready for any turn of events.”",https://thehill.com/policy/international/europe/595631-zelensky-says-ukraine-cutting-diplomatic-ties-with-russia-after/

Ukraine is cutting diplomatic ties with Russia, Ukraine's president announced Thursday, hours after Russia launched an attack.

Volodymyr Zelensky announced the decision at a press conference on Thursday.

Ukraine's foreign ministry said: ""Our country took this step in response to acts of military aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine, the invasion of Russian Armed Forces to destroy the Ukrainian state and the seizure by force of Ukrainian territories with the intent of establishing occupation control.""

Ukraine is evacuating its embassy in Moscow and also recalled its chargé d'affaires in Russia, the ministry said.

Ukraine is, however, keeping its consular functions and will ""continue to defend the rights and interests of Ukrainians in Russia, including Ukrainian political prisoners,"" the ministry said.

Russia attacked Ukraine early Thursday morning in what Ukraine's foreign ministry called a ""full-scale invasion.""

The ministry said Russia was attacking multiple Ukrainian cities ""from different directions.""

Russia and Ukraine have been in conflict for years, but the situation became significantly more urgent in recent weeks.

Russia assembled vast numbers of troops around Ukraine — as many as 190,000, per US estimates — in the largest military operation in the region since World War II.

On Monday, Putin recognized the claims to independence of the breakaway Luhansk and Donetsk areas of Ukraine, where Russia has backed separatist fighters for years. Putin ordered troops there for what he described as ""peacekeeping"" efforts.

Less than 72 hours later, Putin authorized a full-scale attack on Ukraine.

Explosions have since pounded cities across Ukraine, many hundreds of miles from what was the previous conflict zone.

Ukrainian officials reported fighting on its borders with Russia, and dozens of casualties. The new wave of hostilities expanded the clash from a limited incursion over disputed land into the most serious armed conflict in Europe for at least a decade.
