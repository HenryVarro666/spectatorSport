“Today Ukraine is facing horrible humanitarian catastrophe. I feel sorry for Minister Shaked, who forgot that the Jewish people have been refugees for all of their lives. Unfortunately the lessons of history already forgotten. Let me remind you [of] the case of the St.Louis - a vessel boarded with Jews who were trying to escape the horrors of war in Europe and failed to find a safe harbor,” Yevgen Korniychuk said at the opening of a photography exhibition about the war.

The MS St. Louis was a passenger ship carrying hundreds of Jewish refugees which was turned back by various western countries, including Cuba and the United States, before returning its passengers to Europe in 1939.

“Today Ukrainians is facing artificial obstacles to enter Israel and escape horrors of war,” Korniychuk said, stating that he believed most Israelis agreed with him and calling on “the Israeli government to wake up and accompany the spirit of the Jewish people in their actions.”

Korniychuk’s comments came a day after the state informed Israel's High Court that it will continue to restrict the entry of Ukrainian refugees who are not eligible for immigration to Israel under the Law of Return and have no relatives in the country, despite the existence of a visa-free travel agreement between Jerusalem and Kyiv.

Israel's quota for Ukrainian refugees who are ineligible for Israeli citizenship and have no relatives in Israel is 5,000 – though the state said it would allow 20 additional refugees in this category to enter per day, even if the quota is exceeded.",https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/LIVE-ukraine-says-it-reseized-towns-near-kyiv-ahead-of-peace-talks-in-turkey-1.10705208

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

US to move troops and aircraft to Eastern Europe

US armed forces are moving aircraft and soldiers to Eastern Europe, Defense Department spokesperson John Kirby said on Tuesday.

This includes a unit of around 200 marines which has been moved to Lithuania from Norway, Kirby said.

Ten F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets and a few C-130 Hercules transport planes, as well as some 200 associated soldiers, will be brought to Eastern Europe from the US. Kirby said that they would be moved shortly but that their precise destination remained unclear.

US says some Russian troops leaving Kyiv region

Following the announcement earlier on Tuesday that Russia would cut back on its military actions around Kyiv and Chernihiv, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said that the US believed some Russian troops had already left.

""Has there been some movement by some Russian units away from Kyiv in the last day or so? Yes, we think so. Small numbers,"" Kirby told reporters.

""But we believe that this is a repositioning, not a real withdrawal, and that we all should be prepared to watch for a major offensive against other areas of Ukraine. It does not mean that the threat to Kyiv is over,"" he added.

Biden voices skepticism over Russia's pledge to cut activities

US President Joe Biden said he wasn't convinced that Russia's promise to cut back military operations around Kyiv will lead to a significant change in the conflict.

""We'll see if they follow through,"" he told reporters after holding a phone call with the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Italy.

""There seems to be a consensus that let's just see what they have to offer.""

Russian negotiators pledged to scale back hostilities near Kyiv and the city of Chernihiv during talks with Ukraine in Turkey on Tuesday.

France says no Mariupol humanitarian mission possible 'at this stage'

The conditions for carrying out a humanitarian operation sought by France to help civilians in the besieged port city of Mariupol have not been met ""at this stage,"" French President Emmanuel Macron's office said.

The French leader spoke to his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in a phone call on Tuesday.

Macron had outlined the mission sought alongside Turkey and Greece to Putin, who said ""he was going to think about it"" before responding, an Elysee Palace official said.

Mariupol has been one of the worst struck cities since the start of the Ukraine war with the local mayor saying it is now ""on the brink of humanitarian catastrophe.""

Watch video 01:44 Mariupol on 'brink of humanitarian catastrophe'

The Russian president also told Macron that Ukrainian ""nationalists"" in besieged Mariupol must lay down their arms.

""It was stressed that in order to resolve the difficult humanitarian situation in this city (Mariupol), Ukrainian nationalist militants must stop resisting and lay down their arms,"" the Kremlin said in a statement about the call.

The two presidents also discussed Russia's decision to request payments in rubles for Russian gas supplies to the EU, the statement added.

Russia-backed Donetsk considers joining Russia

The head of the so-called Donetsk People's Republic — a part of Ukraine controlled by Russian-backed separatists since 2014 — has said the region will consider joining Russia, according to the Donetsk News Agency.

""As for joining the Russian Federation, as for this wish and drive, they have been obvious since 2014 — the wish to be in Russia,"" Denis Pushilin said.

Moscow recognized the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics on February 24, just days before Russian troops invaded Ukraine.

Pushilin's comments come two days after Russian-backed rebels in Luhansk said they may hold a referendum on joining Russia. Kyiv said such a move would not have legal basis and warned of an international response.

Snake Island soldier receives medal

The Ukrainian soldier, whose comments to a Russian warship went viral, has returned home.

Roman Hrybov was taken prisoner by Russian forces while he was serving on the so-called Snake Island (Zmiinyi Island in Ukrainian), a small island in the Black Sea.

A recording of Hrybov telling a Russian warship to ""go f*** yourself"" went viral.

The Ukrainian troops stationed on the island were at first presumed to have been killed in an attack. It later turned out they had been taken captive and were exchanged for Russian prisoners.

The Ukrainian military shared a picture of the soldier receiving a medal on social media. They said he has returned to ""his native Cherkasy region.""

Russia files two cases against Google over banned content

Russia has filed two legal cases against Alphabet Inc, which owns Google, for failure to remove banned information from its YouTube video-sharing platform, the country's communication regulator said on Tuesday.

Roskomnadzor accused the tech giant of blatantly promoting false content about Russia's invasion, which the Kremlin calls a ""special military operation.""

It said YouTube had become one of the key platforms in the ""information war"" against Moscow.

The regulator added that Google could be fined up to 8 million rubles ($91,533; €82,500), or as much as 20% of the company's annual revenue in Russia for repeat offenses.

Russia has blocked Google News and restricted access to Twitter, Facebook and Instagram

US skeptical of Russian gestures

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken questioned the seriousness of Russia's claims of progress at the Ukraine-Russia talks in Turkey on Tuesday.

""I've not seen anything to suggest that this is moving forward in an effective way because we have not seen signs of real seriousness"" from Russia, Blinken said during an official visit to Morocco.

""There is what Russia says and there is what Russia does. We're focussed on the latter,"" he added.

""If they somehow believe that an effort to subjugate ""only,"" in quotation marks, the eastern part of Ukraine and the southern part of Ukraine can succeed, then once again they are profoundly fooling themselves,"" CNN quoted Blinken as saying.

He once again called on Russia to end the fighting and said the Ukrainians were engaged in negotiations ""with a gun literally to their heads.""

UK calls for 'complete withdrawal' of Russian troops from Ukraine

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a full withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine, his spokesperson said.

Asked about Russia's promise to scale back their armed forces around the cities of Kyiv and Chernihiv, the spokesman said: ""We will judge [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and his regime by his actions, not by his words.""

""There has been some reduction in Russian bombardment around Kyiv, largely because Ukrainian forces have been successfully pushing back the Russian offensives in the northwest of the city,"" he told reporters.

""But fighting continues. There's heavy bombardment in Mariupol and other areas. So we don't want to see anything less than a complete withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukrainian territory.""

Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland expel dozens of Russian diplomats

Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra said the Netherlands has expelled 17 Russian ""intelligence officers"" who were ""undercover as diplomats.""

""These intelligence officers are a threat to the security of [the Netherlands],"" Hoekstra wrote on Twitter.

""Experience shows that Russia does not leave such measures unanswered. We cannot speculate on that, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is prepared for various scenarios that may occur in the near future,"" he said in a statement.

Shortly after the Dutch announcement, Belgian Foreign Minister Sophie Wilmes said Belgium was also expelling 21 Russian diplomats for actions related to espionage or unlawful influence peddling.

Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney later said Ireland was expelling four Russian diplomats whose activities have not been ""in accordance with international standards of diplomatic behavior.""

Poland approves law to ban Russian coal imports

Polish government spokesman Piotr Muller said the Cabinet has adopted draft legislation that will allow a ban on imports of Russian coal.

""We don't want these imports to be possible any longer, although we realize that there's a risk related to the fact that the European Union has not approved such actions to date,"" Muller told reporters in Warsaw.

Generally, the whole EU has to agree on sanctions imposed in the bloc, and Brussels could potentially punish members states acting unilaterally.

Russian representatives not welcome at Buchenwald commemoration

German officials have told Russian and Belarusian diplomatic representatives that they are not welcome at the commemoration for the 77th anniversary of the liberation of the Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora Nazi concentration camps.

""We have informed the consular representations in writing that they are not welcome at the events,"" director of the Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora Memorials Foundation, Jens-Christian Wagner, said on Tuesday.

One reason for the move was the death of the 96-year-old Buchenwald camp survivor Boris Romanchenko.

Romanchenko, who had previously served as vice-president for the international committee of survivors for the two camps, was killed by Russian bombardments in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv in mid-March.

The Nazi camps were liberated by US troops on April 11, 1945, shortly before the end of the Second World War.

UK detains Russian-owned superyacht

Britain has detained a Russian-owned superyacht in what it called a ""warning"" to Moscow of the consequences of invading Ukraine.

Phi is a 58.5-meter (192-foot) vessel worth $50 million (€45 million), boasting a fresh-water swimming pool. It was docked at Canary Wharf in London.

The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) said the ship is registered to a company based in the Caribbean country of St Kitts and Nevis and sails under a Maltese flag.

""The ownership of the yacht was deliberately well-hidden,"" the agency said in a statement, adding that it had ultimately uncovered that its owner was a Russian businessman.

Amnesty International accuses Russia of war crimes in Ukraine

Agnes Callamard, secretary-general of the human rights organization, told DW that Amnesty has been ""documenting an escalation of human rights and humanitarian law violations, including the indiscriminate or deliberate targeting of civilians.""

""Russia's crackdown on freedom of speech started before the aggression against Ukraine,"" Callamard said. She pointed to ""the shrinking space for independent media and dissenting voices,"" which she said goes back to at least 2021.

She added that disinformation and propaganda are part of the war, making it difficult to keep track of what is actually going on.

Callamard also insisted that ""the standards that are applied to … Ukrainian refugees are applied across the board to others.""

""As we speak right now, there are refugees stuck between Belarus and Poland who are denied entry into Poland,"" she added, saying that the failure to support those refugees mean that the west was ""losing a war of values.""

She added that as an outcome of the war, many countries will experience food shortages and skyrocketing prices, exacerbated by the failures of governments to ""build back better"" after the coronavirus pandemic. ""That is the betrayal of 2021,"" she told DW.

Russia-Ukraine talks conclude in Istanbul

Ukrainian and Russian negotiators concluded face-to-face peace talks in Istanbul on Tuesday, with the Ukrainian side saying that there have been enough developments to have a meeting between the presidents of the two countries.

Russia said the talks were ""constructive,"" raising hopes that there could be progress toward ending the war.

However, Russian top negotiator Medinsky said a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy is possible only if a deal has been approved by the foreign ministries of both countries.

Following the talks, Ukrainian negotiators told reporters that Kyiv would agree to a neutral status if a security guarantee system is put in place. They said, under the new system, Israel, Poland, Canada and Turkey could be among Ukraine’s security guarantors.

The neutral status would include not hosting any foreign military bases on Ukrainian territory.

There needs to be full peace across Ukraine for any final agreement with Russia to come into force, the Ukrainian side stressed, adding that a referendum would be needed in Ukraine on the terms of any final deal.

They also proposed holding consultations with Russia on the status of Crimea.

The talks on Tuesday lasted around four hours with occasional breaks. It is unclear if the discussions will continue for a second day.

Russia says the military's main task is now to 'liberate' Donbas

Russia's defense minister Sergei Shoigu said on Tuesday that Ukraine's military capacity had been seriously degraded, the Interfax news agency reported. ""The combat potential of the Ukrainian armed forces has been significantly reduced, which makes it possible to focus the main attention and main efforts on achieving the main goal — the liberation of Donbas.""

Shoigu's assertion came despite Ukraine's unexpectedly strong resistance since the war began last month, which has seen Russia fail to take any major cities, and stall in advancing along multiple fronts.

However, Shoigu reiterated statements made last week by officials that the Russian military had completed the main objective of the first phase of its invasion.

The minister also stressed the change in Russia's war aims, underlining that the main task of the Russian military is now to ""liberate"" Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, part of which has been under the control of Russian proxies since 2014.

Furthermore, he warned the West that Moscow will respond appropriately if NATO supplies fighter aircraft and air defense systems to Ukraine.

US to deploy fighter jets to Germany to boost NATO posture

The United States is deploying six Navy EA-18G Growler aircraft to the Spangdahlem airbase in Germany to bolster NATO's defense posture, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said.

This is ""to bolster readiness and NATO's collective defense posture and further increase air integration capabilities with our Allied and partner nations,"" he said during a conference call.

Kirby stressed that the aircraft were not intended to be used against the Russian military in Ukraine, but were intended to strengthen NATO's eastern flank and serve as a deterrent against Russia.

Kirby added that some 240 Navy personnel, consisting of pilots and maintenance crew, will also be stationed to maintain the aircraft.

The aircraft, developed by the US firm Boeing, are used in electronic warfare to counter adversaries by offering tactical jamming capabilities besides offering land and naval defense.

""The restrictions have been in place for roughly a month, a little bit over a month, and we certainly haven't seen any indication that there's non-compliance, in fact, we've seen the reverse,"" he said.

""I think there's also a fair amount of additional self-sanctioning, if you will, by multinational companies operating in Russia,"" the official added.

Russia's Novaya Gazeta newspaper said it would stop publishing until the war in Ukraine ends. The leading independent publication, edited by Nobel Peace Prize winner Dmitry Muratov, said it was taking the step after receiving a second warning from the media regulator Roskomnadzor.

If a media outlet receives two warnings from the communications regulator, a court can shut it down.

Meanwhile, the G7 rejected Russia's demand for gas payment in rubles.

Week five of Russia’s war in Ukraine brought some Ukrainian successes around Kyiv and a Russian reorientation to focus on “liberating” the eastern Donbas region, suggesting Moscow is giving up on regime change and focusing on territorial gains with a view to a settlement.

The week also offered a glimpse of what that settlement might look like.

Ukraine put forward a detailed proposal of neutrality as negotiators met in Istanbul on March 29. It included pledges to not join military alliances or host foreign troops, and that it would remain a non-nuclear power.

That would mean Ukraine would give up its aspirations to join NATO, as Russian President Vladimir Putin has demanded.

Ukraine suggested guarantors will be permanent members of the UN Security Council – the United States, the United Kingdom, France, China and Russia – as well as Israel, Turkey, Germany, Canada and Poland.

Some experts have said such a peace deal would weaken Ukrainian sovereignty and reward Russia.

“In terms of international legal norms, it is absolutely unacceptable that stronger powers violate international borders and dictate their terms to the weaker side,” said Greek former Deputy Foreign Minister Yiannis Valinakis.

“However, wars usually end up creating new realities on the ground … Russia will insist on at least partial demilitarisation of Ukraine,” he told Al Jazeera.

Valinakis believes security guarantees will be problematic for both sides.

“I cannot see Putin‘s interest in accepting the proposed guarantees. NATO itself will not encourage its members granting security guarantees to Kyiv; in case of a Russian attack on a guarantor power, the Alliance would risk activating article 5 [on collective defence] and thereby a catastrophic escalation to a Russia-NATO war.”

Ukrainian negotiator Oleksander Chaly highlighted the proposal’s positives.

“If we manage to consolidate these key provisions … Ukraine will be in a position to actually fix its current status as a non-bloc and non-nuclear state in the form of permanent neutrality,” he said.

Territorial concessions in Luhansk and Donetsk would be discussed directly by Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy, according to the Ukrainian proposal. The fate of Crimea would be the subject of a 15-year consultation.

“These are diplomatic formulas designed to alleviate public opinion pressure on Zelenskyy,” Valinakis said. “In the absence of a sizeable rollback of Russian troops to the east, I don’t see a very different outcome for the peace negotiations.”

The peace deal would be put to a referendum in Ukraine.

Military stasis

Diplomatic overtures were accompanied by Russian redeployments this week.

Russia unilaterally said it would “radically, by a large margin, reduce military activity in the Kyiv and Chernihiv directions”, Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Formin said on March 29.

However, on Wednesday, Russia continued to shell parts of Kyiv and Chernihiv.

Earlier in the week, Russia said it would focus its military activity in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions in the east, which it already largely controls.

“The main objectives of the first stage of the operation have generally been accomplished,” said General Sergey Rudskoy, head of the general staff’s main operational directorate, in what may have been a face-saving posture.

Russia has made little progress against Kyiv’s defences, and US defence sources have said Russian forces are stalled 15-20km (9-12 miles) from the city centre.

Russia has also been unable to capture Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol – which have been devastated by Russian shelling. Ukrainian officials say thousands of civilians have been killed in besieged Mariupol, where an estimated 160,000 people remain trapped with little food, water or medicine.

There are US reports that Ukrainian forces are contesting Kherson, the only city to have fallen into Russian hands.

NATO has estimated that Russia has lost 7,000-15,000 troops during a month of war. The upper estimate aligns with Ukraine’s own assessment, and is equal to the number of troops Russia lost across a decade in Afghanistan.

These losses appear to be translating into bad morale. Western sources believe the commander of the Russian 37th Motor Rifle Brigade was deliberately killed when he was run over by one of his unit’s armoured vehicles. The unit has suffered a 50 percent casualty rate besieging Kyiv.

Meanwhile, the number of people who have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded on February 24 has surpassed four million, the United Nations said on Wednesday.

Unity in outrage

US President Joe Biden visited Europe midweek to demonstrate the transatlantic unity brought about by the Ukraine war. US officials had to clarify that a remark made by Biden in Poland – that Putin “cannot remain in power” given the atrocities he has committed – was not a call for regime change in Moscow.

Biden has at various times called Putin a “war criminal”, a “brute” and a “butcher”, straining faith in any possible future discussion between the two men.

But the outrage Biden was tapping into highlighted the deepening US-EU ties he came to showcase.

“Vladimir Putin gave NATO and the EU-US consensus the kiss of life,” said Alexandros Mallias, Greece’s former ambassador to Washington.

“NATO is entering a second youth … I never remember such strong cooperation between the US and Europe on countering Russia,” he told Al Jazeera.

On March 23, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, “The US government assesses that members of Russia’s forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine … Many of the sites Russia’s forces have hit have been clearly identifiable as in-use by civilians.”

The level of destruction wrought on Ukrainian cities by Russian forces underline Putin’s determination not to appear to lose, Mallias said.

“Since 2008, when Russia invaded Georgia, every time we said Putin wouldn’t do something, our predictions were proven wrong … Someone who doesn’t hesitate to give orders for children to be killed, for cities to be levelled, wiped off the map, for hospitals and schools to be bombed – why would such a person have any compunction about using a weapon of mass destruction? He’s already causing mass destruction with conventional weapons,” Mallias told Al Jazeera.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/30/ukraine-russia-talks-offer-glimmer-of-hope-in-fifth-week-of-war
4,2b76f637-8b51-491f-b722-274904f2c9a4,[],,"LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Ukraine proposed adopting neutral status in exchange for security guarantees at talks with Russia in Turkey, meaning it would not join military alliances or host military bases, Ukrainian negotiators said on Tuesday.

The proposals would also include a 15-year consultation period on the status of annexed Crimea and could come into force only in the event of a complete ceasefire, the negotiators told reporters in Istanbul.

The proposals are the most detailed and concrete that Ukraine has aired publicly. They also envisage security guarantees along the lines of the NATO military alliance's Article 5, its collective defence clause. Poland, Israel, Turkey and Canada could among the potential security guarantors.

""If we manage to consolidate these key provisions, and for us this is the most fundamental, then Ukraine will be in a position to actually fix its current status as a non-bloc and non-nuclear state in the form of permanent neutrality,"" said negotiator Oleksander Chaly.

""We will not host foreign military bases on our territory, as well as deploy military contingents on our territory, and we will not enter into military-political alliances,"" he said, in comments broadcast on Ukrainian national television.

""Military exercises on our territory will take place with the consent of the guarantor countries.""

There was enough material in the current Ukrainian proposals to warrant a meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Ukrainian negotiators said, adding they were awaiting Russia's response.

Ukrainian and Russian negotiators met in Turkey on Tuesday for the first face-to-face talks in nearly three weeks, with Ukraine seeking a ceasefire without compromising on territory or sovereignty as its forces have pushed Russians back from Kyiv.

The White House today reacted with deep skepticism to Russia’s promise to reduce violence in Ukraine as a means of paving the way for possible peace talks, with government officials suggesting that the Kremlin was simply redirecting, not ending, its invasion.

Negotiations in Istanbul between Ukrainian and Russian officials seemed to yield some progress to a possible meeting between Ukraine’s VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY and Russia’s VLADIMIR PUTIN. As for a direct discussion between Putin and President JOE BIDEN himself, White House officials firmly underscored that Moscow would need to take more convincing steps toward curtailing the war before any such talk would take place, according to two administration officials not authorized to speak publicly about private deliberations.

The reaction from the White House was a veritable dousing of cold water on what, hours earlier, seemed like one of the first, sincere potential diplomatic breakthroughs more than a month into the bloody conflict. At the talks in Turkey, both Ukrainian and Russian sides said moves were being made toward a leaders’ summit, as Kyiv for the first time signaled a willingness to hold negotiations over territory seized by Moscow. Russian Deputy Defense Minister ALEXANDER FOMIN said his military planned to “fundamentally cut back” military activity near the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv and another northern city in an effort “to increase trust” around the peace talks.

But Biden administration officials cautioned that while they had seen a recent reduction in Russian attacks around Kyiv and Chernihiv, violence had continued unabated and even grown elsewhere, particularly in southern and eastern Ukraine. Moreover, the officials said that the pause near Kyiv may be a ruse to resupply troops and that the violence could ramp up at any time.

“I've not seen anything to suggest that this is moving forward in an effective way because we have not seen signs of real seriousness"" from Russia, said Secretary of State ANTONY BLINKEN at a press conference in Morocco.

More vitally, even if Russia did silence its guns near the Ukrainian capital, it still very much was conducting an active assault on other regions — which would inherently undermine any sort of cease-fire, according to the U.S. officials.

Feeding the new push for diplomacy has been the growing recognition that the Russian invasion has badly stalled, with Moscow taking huge personnel and equipment losses. Biden aides, buoyed by Ukraine’s military campaign to date, nevertheless scoffed at the suggestion that Putin was ending the war, instead believing he likely was temporarily focusing on a more winnable region, the officials said. The Donbas region — parts of which have been held by Kremlin-backed separatist forces since 2014 — appeared to be a particular target.

Putin’s campaign has gone so unexpectedly poorly that U.S. officials have begun reviewing their own intelligence assessments to determine how they could have so badly misjudged the strength of the Russian military. Despite pouring billions of dollars into modernizing Russia’s military, Putin’s forces have been saddled with poor equipment, communications and morale — all leading to, so far, a stalemate against a much smaller and overmatched foe.

To that point, one U.S. official bluntly said: “The Russians really fucked this up.”

Experts agreed. “It's a huge retreat from Putin's initial war aims,” said JEFFREY EDMONDS, former Russia director on BARACK OBAMA's National Security Council and now adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security think tank. “This is a huge defeat to Putin's maximalist initial goals. The Russian leadership is trying to salvage a military fiasco.”

SITUATION REPORT: We will only cite official sources. As always, take all figures, assessments and statements with a healthy dose of skepticism.

War in Ukraine:

— Since the war began on Feb. 24, Russia has lost around 17,200 personnel, 597 tanks, 1,710 armored combat vehicles, 303 artillery systems, 96 multiple-launch rocket systems, 127 warplanes, 129 helicopters, seven ships and 71 drones (Ukrainian Ministry of Defense)

— “The withdrawal of certain units of the armed forces of the Russian Federation from the territory of Kyiv and Chernihiv oblasts is noted. At the same time, there is a high risk of the Russian occupiers attacking military and civilian infrastructure.” (Ukrainian Ministry of Defense)

— In the Donetsk area, Russia has “activated assault actions in most directions.” (Ukrainian Ministry of Defense)

— “Ukrainian Forces have continued to conduct localised counter attacks to the north west of Kyiv - including at Irpen, Bucha and Hostomel. These attacks have had some success and the Russians have been pushed back from a number of positions. However, Russia still poses a significant threat to the city through their strike capability. Russian Forces have maintained their offensive on Mariupul with continuous heavy shelling of the city, however the centre of the city remains under Ukrainian control. Elsewhere, Russian Forces are maintaining blocking positions while attempting to reorganise and reset their forces.” (U.K. Ministry of Defense)

Global Response:

— Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands and Czech Republic: These four countries collectively expelled 43 Russian diplomats over allegations of spying and unlawful influence activities. They have two weeks to leave the European nations.

— U.S.: Gen. TOD WOLTERS, head of U.S. European Command and NATO’s supreme allied commander, said the U.S. may need to put more American service members in Europe.

— U.S.: A correction: On Monday, we made an error in saying that the six Growlers the U.S. is sending to Germany came from Washington, D.C., not Washington state. We regret the error and thank Rep. RICK LARSEN (D-Wash.), who represents the district where the Growlers came from, for pointing out our oversight.

RUSSIA CLAIMS IT WILL CUT BACK KYIV ATTACKS: After negotiations today between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations in Istanbul — the two sides’ first round of face-to-face peace talks in three weeks — Russian Deputy Defense Minister Fomin said Moscow would dramatically reduce its military offensive around Kyiv, per POLITICO’s VICTOR JACK.

“The decision has been taken to fundamentally cut back military activity in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv,” Fomin said. This would “increase mutual trust for future negotiations” in order “to agree and sign a peace deal with Ukraine,” he added.

Fomin’s remarks come after Colonel General SERGEI RUDSKOY, first deputy chief of Russia's General Staff, said Friday that “the main tasks of the first stage” of Russia’s invasion “have been completed,” and that Russian forces would focus their efforts in the breakaway Donbas region in eastern Ukraine.

UKRAINE OFFERS NEUTRALITY: Ukraine proposed a neutral status during peace talks with Russia in Turkey, an offer with hopes of reaching a cease-fire to end the war Moscow started.

“After the talks in Istanbul, Ukrainian negotiators said that their key demands included guarantees for Ukraine’s security from the U.S., the U.K., France, Turkey, Germany, Canada, Poland and Israel,” per The Wall Street Journal’s JAMES MARSON, YAROSLAV TROFIMOV, and JARED MALSIN.

“This is the system we would like to build the future of Ukraine on,” Ukrainian negotiator DAVID ARAKHAMIA told reporters after

the talks. “We want an international mechanism of security guarantees where guarantor countries will act in a similar way to NATO’s article number five.”

The Ukrainian position has moved away from demanding accession to NATO and softened to its current stance, clearly in an effort to compromise with Russia to stop the fighting. But few in Ukraine and elsewhere in the West believe Russia is negotiating in good faith.

EUCOM SAYS U.S. NOT TRAINING UKRAINIANS IN POLAND: Last night, Alex and PAUL McLEARY reported on Biden seeming to reveal the U.S. was training Ukrainian troops in Poland — potentially disclosing more direct U.S. assistance to help Ukrainians fight and kill Russians.

But Gen. Wolters said that’s not the case today. ""I do not believe that we are in the process of currently training military forces from Ukraine in Poland,” he told the Senate Armed Services Committee today. “There are liaisons that are there that are being given advice, and that's different than I think you're referring to with respect to training.""

In other words, American service members are verbally helping the Ukrainians, but that’s far different than putting them through drills. If that’s the case, it seems that the president once again made a gaffe, exaggerating the level of direct U.S. military support for Ukraine once the war began.

TOP TREASURY OFFICIAL PREVIEWS SUPPLY CHAIN SANCTIONS: Deputy Treasury Secretary WALLY ADEYEMO, speaking today in London, warned that a forthcoming round of Western sanctions against Russia will target supply chains and undermine “the Kremlin’s ability to operate its war machine,” per Reuters.

“In addition to sanctioning companies in sectors that enable the Kremlin’s malign activities, we also plan to take actions to disrupt their critical supply chains,” Adeyemo said. The goal of the measures — expected to also punish alternative military suppliers used by Russia — “is to use an integrated approach that includes export controls which will bite over time and sanctions that will bite immediately,” he said.

Adeyemo went on to predict that nations such as China and India “are going to remain part of” the global financial system amid Russia’s invasion, rather than economically disengage with the West. “The system has adapted and moulded to members that have come along to create huge reductions in poverty, and not just Western countries,” he said, adding that “the benefits of the system far outweigh the risks.”

Flashpoints

CHINA ENTERS THE CHAT: U.S. Indo-Pacific Command chief Adm. JOHN AQUILINO has sent Congress a whopping $76 billion, five-year plan that calls for new airfields and training ranges spread across the Pacific, along with missile defense systems, long-range precision weapons, and other new capabilities to confront China.

An executive summary of the plan, obtained by McLeary (for Pros!), calls for $9 billion in fiscal 2023, with another $66.9 billion spread over the next four years.

The biggest slice of the request is $42.4 billion aimed at building a new air and missile defense system for Guam, along with deploying “electronic warfare, space, cyber, and over-the-horizon radar” systems across the region.

The document also asks for $25 billion to build new airfields and repair existing airstrips that would allow U.S. forces to spread out from megabases in places such as Guam and Okinawa, which provide juicy targets to long-range Chinese weapons. These sites would also provide new training ranges for the U.S. and its allies, and include facilities to forward-position equipment.

EUROPE TO DEFEND SWEDEN? German Chancellor OLAF SCHOLZ suggested the European Union would come to Sweden’s defense if Russia attacked the non-NATO country, POLITICO’s HANS VON DER BURCHARD reported.

Speaking at a joint press conference with Swedish Prime Minister MAGDALENA ANDERSSON in Berlin, Scholz noted that the EU had built a mutual assistance clause into its core treaty. He said that clause would be “taken very seriously” if it came to an attack against Sweden. “When it comes down to it, it can be relied upon,” Scholz added.

Sweden and Finland, both in the European Union, say that the bloc is also defensive and that members should assist each other in their moment of need.

“Scholz’s remarks indicated Berlin agrees with that assessment,” per von der Burchard. “However, how much the EU could do to defend Sweden is open to question, given that — unlike NATO — it does not include the military superpower United States, or the United Kingdom, one of the Continent’s few military heavyweights.”

RUSSIA SAYS U.S. LAUNCHED CYBERATTACK. U.S. DENIES: The Russian Foreign Ministry claimed on its website that the U.S. launched a cyberattack on Russia’s critical infrastructure — a claim the Biden administration firmly denies.

“The United States and its satellites are waging a large-scale cyberattack against Russia. Advanced information and communication technologies are being used almost every day to attack government agencies, media outlets, critical infrastructure and vital facilities,” the ministry said. “The unprecedented scale of these attacks and their close coordination clearly indicate that the cyberwar waged against Russia by Ukrainian special ICT operations centres trained by US and other NATO experts is being reinforced with anonymous hackers and trolls acting on orders from the Kiev regime’s Western mentors.”

But EMILY HORNE, the NSC’s spokesperson, said that’s just not true. ""The United States Government has not engaged in the activity described by Russia. Moscow’s statements to the contrary amount to disinformation,"" she told The Hill’s BRAD DRESS.

There’s no evidence to support Russia’s claim, and the Kremlin is known for pushing false narratives. Russia also often accuses adversaries of doing something right before it’s about to do it. Last week, Biden said cyberattacks likely emanating from Russia were “coming.”



The Complex

BOARD GAMES: Our friends at Morning Defense (for Pros!) reported that Aerojet Rocketdyne CEO EILEEN DRAKE on Monday proposed former Air Force Secretary DEBORAH LEE JAMES and three others as replacements for WARREN LICHTENSTEIN and his slate of directors on the company’s board.

In an SEC filing, Drake alleges Lichtenstein violated his fiduciary duties by launching a proxy contest for control of the company while Aerojet’s now-defunct merger with Lockheed Martin was pending.

Drake’s slate for the board also includes Gail Baker, a former Collins Aerospace executive; MARION BLAKEY, former head of Rolls-Royce North America and the Aerospace Industries Association; and former NASA Administrator CHARLIE BOLDEN.

Lichtenstein’s list includes Heidi Wood, an executive vice president for business development at CAE; AIMEE NELSON, a “finance professional”; and JOANNE MAGUIRE, a former executive vice president leading Lockheed Martin’s space business.

Both factions will seek to install their picks at the upcoming annual shareholders meeting, which has not yet been scheduled.

Oh, the drama!



On the Hill

RAND STALLS RUSSIA TRADE BILL: Sen. RAND PAUL (R-Ky.) is yet again frustrating his fellow Republicans’ foreign policy messaging, per our own BURGESS EVERETT and ANDREW DESIDERIO — this time by single-handedly delaying a revocation of normal trade relations with Moscow, thereby slowing efforts to further incapacitate Russia’s economy.

Paul is refusing to allow a quick vote on the bill absent a deal to narrow presidential power to enact sanctions, even though leaders in both parties have spurned that request. On Monday, Republicans aired long-building exasperation with their Kentucky colleague; Senate Minority Whip JOHN THUNE (R-S.D.) simply threw up his arms when asked if there was anything GOP leaders could do to move him.

But some Republicans instead criticized Senate Majority Leader CHUCK SCHUMER’s handling of the trade bill and dismissed suggestions that Paul’s holdup undermined their unity. Schumer could have allocated enough floor time to overcome Paul’s objections rather than counting on a fast-tracked process that requires unanimous support, they pointed out.

FIRST IN NATSEC DAILY –– COST OF WAR ACT: A bipartisan trio is set to unveil the “Cost of War Act,” which would require the Pentagon to reveal the cost per taxpayer of any U.S. military operation since 9/11.

The legislation, introduced today by Reps. NIKEMA WILLIAMS (D-Ga.), PETER MEIJER (R-Mich.) and SARA JACOBS (D-Calif.) — modernizes a measure first put forward by the late Rep. JOHN LEWIS (D-Ga.).

“With the rising costs Americans face right now, we owe our constituents clear information on government spending. When we invest in things like schools and the infrastructure we use daily, we feel the impacts in our communities. But it’s much harder to grasp the costs and impacts of our military spending,” Williams said in a statement.

“This is a critical step forward in our bipartisan effort to restore congressional authority and oversight on matters of national security,” Meijer added.

The Cost of War Act is supported by the NAACP and progressive groups like Just Foreign Policy, VoteVets and Foreign Policy for America.



Broadsides

ROMNEY WARNS TRUMP COULD TRIGGER NATO REALIGNMENT: Sen. MITT ROMNEY (R-Utah) issued more dire predictions about the foreign policy dangers posed by a potential second DONALD TRUMP term — telling CNN Plus’ KASIE HUNT that if the former president is elected again in 2024, it may result in a major transformation of NATO.

Trump’s “America First” brand of diplomacy “frightens” fellow NATO members, Romney said, “and they wonder: Are we committed to NATO and to our mutual defense, or are we all going to go off on our own?” Trump threatened to abandon the alliance as president if other members didn’t meet certain military spending levels.

If Trump were to return to the White House now, “I think it would represent a pretty dramatic departure for the world,” Romney said. NATO allies “would say that they have to really rethink their own national security and the extent to which they want to be allied with us and instead be allied with someone else.”

“I’ve had conversations with leaders of other nations now, members of NATO,” Romney said, “and they raise this question: We’re happy to see you committed to our mutual defense, but we don’t know whether you’re just committed short-term or whether this is a long-term and permanent commitment. I think it’s long-term and permanent.”

PROGRESSIVES BASH PENTAGON BUDGET: In a statement on Biden’s proposed FY 2023 budget, the Congressional Progressive Caucus made clear it thinks a rise in defense spending — to $813 billion — is no bueno.

“It is simply unacceptable that after the conclusion of our longest war and during a period of Democratic control of both chambers of Congress, the President is proposing record high military spending,” the caucus said. “As Pentagon spending has exploded, the federal government has been forced to pinch pennies for decades when it comes to investments in working families.”

Biden is now deep in one of Washington, D.C.’s most classic traps: The right thinks the president isn’t proposing enough for defense, while the left thinks he wants to spend too much. The president has been in town long enough to know that many will be angry no matter what he budgets.

Senior members of the Ukrainian delegation who spoke with Russian officials today said there was progress after a day of talks in Turkey — and provided more detail on what security guarantees Ukraine would expect after a ceasefire.

Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, referred to talks about the status of Crimea, which annexed by Russia in 2014.

""I want to emphasize as regards the territories of Crimea and Sevastopol, it was agreed in bilateral format to take a pause for 15 years and conduct bilateral talks on the status of these territories,"" he said.

Ukraine and the West have refused to recognize the Russian annexation of the peninsula, and the pause could be a formula for taking the issue off the table for now.

""Separately, we discussed that during 15 years while the bilateral talks take place, there will be no military hostilities,"" Podolyak added.

He also referred to one of the toughest elements in the talks: security guarantees for Ukraine if and when a ceasefire and peace settlement are agreed upon.

""Undoubtedly, this treaty on security guarantees may only be signed after a ceasefire and the complete withdrawal of Russian troops to their positions on the 23rd of February 2022,"" he said.

""We are simply bringing our proposals as negotiators to Russia about the system of security guarantees of Ukraine,"" he continued.

Podolyak said the Russian negotiators have ""taken the treaty that outlines ways to end the war"" and will work out their counter-proposals.

He added that both sides are still ""discussing a humanitarian ceasefire,"" stressing there are ""many places where humanitarian corridors are needed.""

Another member of the Ukrainian team, David Arakhamia, also spoke about security guarantees. ""We insist that this be an international treaty, signing all the guarantors of security, which will be ratified.""

He said this would be comparable to NATO's Article 5, which enshrines the principle of collective defense. The arrangement, he said, would be similar to Article 5, ""but even with a stricter activation mechanism.""

""We say that consultations should take place within three days. They need to find out if this is war, aggression, a military operation. ... After that, the guarantor countries are obliged to help us. And military aid, and the armed forces, and weapons, and the closed sky — all that we need so much now, and we cannot get it. This is our proposal,"" he said.

Arakhamia named the guarantors as ""the [permanent] countries of the UN Security Council"" as well as Turkey, Germany, Canada, Italy, Poland and Israel.

""We have stipulated in this agreement that the guarantor countries must not only not deny Ukraine's accession to the EU, but also help with it,"" he said.

Arakhamia added: ""Of course, we have unresolved issues with the occupied parts of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, with Crimea and Sevastopol. And international security guarantees will not work temporarily in these territories.""

A third member of the Ukrainian delegation, Oleksandr Chalyi, also stressed the three-day deadline for consultations in the event of ""any aggression, military attack or military operation.""

""And if these consultations do not lead to a diplomatic solution to the problem, the guarantor countries must provide us with military assistance, weapons, and even we include such a situation as closed airspace over Ukraine,"" Chalyi said.

Speaking to Ukrainian television, he said: ""Doing everything possible to restore Ukraine's security is a key requirement. If we manage to consolidate these key provisions, which is the most fundamental requirement for us, Ukraine will in fact be in a position to fix its current status as a non-aligned and non-nuclear state in the form of permanent neutrality.""

""Accordingly, these guarantees, which are in fact in line with NATO Article 5, as required by our country's Constitution. [We] will not deploy foreign military bases or military contingents on our territory, and we will not enter into military-political alliances. Military trainings in our country will be conducted with the consent of our guarantor countries,"" Chalyi said.

""However, it is fundamental for us that nothing in these provisions will deny our accession to the EU. The guarantor countries are also committed to facilitating these processes,"" he added.",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-29-22/h_3811d51946bc862bc9ad9a14c509d061

8,2b76f637-8b51-491f-b722-274904f2c9a4,[],2022-03-29 16:47:14,"Russia promised at peace talks on Tuesday (29 March) to scale down its military operations around Kyiv and northern Ukraine, while Ukraine proposed adopting a neutral status but with international guarantees that it would be protected from attack.

The talks in a palace in Istanbul came as Russia’s invasion has been halted on most fronts by strong resistance, with Ukrainians recapturing territory in counter-attacks, even as civilians are trapped in besieged cities.

“In order to increase mutual trust and create the necessary conditions for further negotiations and achieving the ultimate goal of agreeing and signing (an) agreement, a decision was made to radically, by a large margin, reduce military activity in the Kyiv and Chernihiv directions,” Russian Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin told reporters.

Russia’s General Staff would reveal more detail about those decisions after the Russian delegation returned to Moscow, Fomin added.

The talks held in Istanbul on Tuesday were the first face-to-face meeting between the sides since 10 March.

Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, and has failed to capture any major Ukrainian cities after meeting fierce resistance.

Ukraine’s proposals at the talks were the most detailed that either side has aired publicly.

Ukrainian negotiators said that under their proposals, Ukraine would agree not to join alliances or host bases of foreign troops, but would have its security guaranteed in terms similar to “Article 5”, the collective defence clause of NATO.

They identified Israel and NATO members Canada, Poland and Turkey as countries that could help provide such guarantees. Russia, the United States, Britain, Germany and Italy could also provide guarantees.

The proposals would include a 15-year consultation period on the status of Russian-annexed Crimea, and could come into force only in the event of a complete ceasefire, the negotiators said.

The fate of the southeastern Donbas region, which Russia demands Ukraine cede to separatists, would be set aside to be discussed by the Ukrainian and Russian leaders, they added. Any peace deal would require a referendum in Ukraine.

Top Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said he would examine the Ukrainian proposals and report on them to President Vladimir Putin. The Ukrainian negotiators called for a meeting between Putin and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

“If we manage to consolidate these key provisions … then Ukraine will be in a position to actually fix its current status as a non-bloc and non-nuclear state in the form of permanent neutrality,” Ukrainian negotiator Oleksander Chaly said.

“We will not host foreign military bases on our territory, as well as deploy military contingents on our territory, and we will not enter into military-political alliances,” he said. Military exercises would take place with the consent of the guarantor countries.

Bombed-out cities

More than a month into the war, the biggest attack on a European nation since World War Two, more than 3.9 million people have fled abroad, thousands have been killed and injured, and Russia’s economy has been pummelled by sanctions.

In the southern port city of Mariupol, besieged by Russian forces since the war’s early days, nearly 5,000 people have been killed, according to figures from the mayor which cannot be verified.

In parts of the city now held by Russian troops, the few visible residents appeared ghostlike among charred and bombed-out apartment blocks. A little girl in a pink puffy coat and yellow knitted hat was playing with a stick in the ruins as explosions crackled in the distance. Someone was scavenging through the rubble with a wheelbarrow.

“Look at our food reserve. We are eight people. We have two buckets of potatoes, one bucket of onions,” said Irina, an engineer, in her apartment where windows had been blasted out. They were boiling soup on a makeshift stove in the stairwell.

Elsewhere, however, Ukrainian forces have made advances in recent days, recapturing territory from Russian troops on the outskirts of Kyiv, in the northeast, and in the south, as Moscow’s invasion has stalled in the face of strong resistance.

An area recaptured by Ukrainian forces northeast of the capital on a road towards the village of Rusaniv was littered with burnt-out tanks and bits of Russian uniforms. Surrounding houses were destroyed. A Ukrainian in uniform was digging a pit in the soil to bury the charred remains of a Russian soldier.

In the southern city of Mykolaiv, a missile blasted a hole through the main administrative building. Authorities said at least seven people were killed and 20 injured, including 18 pulled from the rubble by rescue workers.

Russia’s Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said Russia had largely completed the first phase of its military assault, had degraded Ukraine’s military capabilities and would now focus on areas claimed by separatists in the southeast.

Moscow made a similar declaration late last week, interpreted in the West as a sign it was giving up on initial aims of toppling the Kyiv government.

Russia calls its mission a “special operation” to disarm and “denazify” Ukraine. The West says it launched an unprovoked invasion.

Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich was at the venue of the talks. The Kremlin said he was there as a go-between but not part of Russia’s delegation. Russia, the United States and Ukraine have all played down media reports that he may have been poisoned while on an earlier peace mission.

Air raid sirens sounded before dawn across Ukraine, the latest sign of Russia’s increasing reliance on long-range strikes. Russia’s defence ministry said on Tuesday it had struck a large fuel depot in the western Rivne region overnight, far from any fighting.

In an address on Monday night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy repeated calls for the West to go further in punishing Moscow for its invasion, including expanding sanctions to ban energy exports.
