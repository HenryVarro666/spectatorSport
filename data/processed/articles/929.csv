Good morning to all of you and welcome to this extraordinary NATO Summit.

We gather at the critical time for our security.

We are united in condemning the Kremlin’s unprovoked aggression.

And in our support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.

We are determined to continue to impose costs on Russia to bring about the end of this brutal war.

We pay tribute to the great courage of the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian armed forces. Fighting for their freedom and their rights.

We also recognize those in Russia who are bravely speaking out against the war. We hear their voices. They matter.

Today we will discuss Allied support to Ukraine. We will also address NATO’s efforts to strengthen our defences, now and for years to come. We are already doing more. On land. At sea. And in the air. This is necessary to respond to a new security reality in Europe.

This concludes the public part of the meeting. I thank the media for joining us at the opening. And we will continue our deliberations in a moment. Thank you so much for joining us.",https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_193612.htm?selectedLocale=en

Good afternoon.

NATO leaders will meet in Brussels tomorrow at a pivotal moment for our security.

And I look forward to welcoming President Zelensky who will address us during the meeting.

President Putin’s brutal invasion of Ukraine is causing death and destruction every day.

Allies stand united.

In support for the brave people of Ukraine.

And against the Kremlin’s cruelty.

Putin must end this war.

Allow aid and safe passage for civilians.

And engage in real diplomacy.



NATO Allies have responded to this crisis with strong support for Ukraine.

And unprecedented costs for Russia.

NATO has acted with speed and unity to protect and defend all Allies.

There are now hundreds of thousands of Allied troops at heightened readiness across the Alliance.

One hundred thousand US troops in Europe.

And 40,000 forces under direct NATO command, mostly in the eastern part of the alliance.

All backed by major air and naval power.

Including five carrier strike groups in the High North and in the Mediterranean.

At the Summit tomorrow, we will make further decisions.

I expect leaders will agree to strengthen NATO’s posture in all domains.

With major increases to our forces in the eastern part of the Alliance.

On land, in the air, and at sea.

The first step is the deployment of four new NATO battlegroups.

In Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia.

Along with our existing forces in the Baltic countries and Poland, this means that we will have eight multinational NATO battlegroups all along the eastern flank.

From the Baltic to the Black Sea.

We face a new reality for our security.

So we must reset our deterrence and defence for the longer-term.

Tomorrow, NATO leaders will reaffirm our support to Ukraine.

Ukraine has the right to self-defence under the UN Charter.

And we are helping Ukrainians to uphold this fundamental right.

Since 2014, Allies have trained Ukraine’s armed forces, and significantly strengthened their capabilities.

They are putting that training into practice now, on the front lines, with great bravery.

In the last months, Allies have stepped up military support.

Providing anti-tank and air defence systems, drones, fuel and ammunition.

As well as financial aid.

And hosting millions of refugees.

Tomorrow, I expect Allies will agree to provide additional support.

Including cybersecurity assistance.

As well as equipment to help Ukraine protect against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats.

President Putin’s invasion is brutal.

And the human suffering is horrifying and painful to witness.

We are determined to do all we can to support Ukraine.

But we have a responsibility to ensure that the war does not escalate beyond Ukraine, and become a conflict between NATO and Russia.

This would cause even more death and even more destruction.

I also expect we will agree to step up tailored support for other partners at risk from Russian pressure.

Including Georgia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Working together, with the European Union, we must help them to uphold their sovereignty, and their right to make independent decisions.

We face a fundamentally changed security environment.

Where authoritarian powers are increasingly prepared to use force to get their way.

So I expect we will also address the role of China in this crisis.

Beijing has joined Moscow in questioning the right of independent nations to choose their own path.

China has provided Russia with political support, including by spreading blatant lies and disinformation.

And Allies are concerned that China could provide material support for the Russian invasion.

I expect leaders will call on China to live up to its responsibilities as a member of the UN Security Council.

Refrain from supporting Russia’s war effort.

And join the rest of the world in calling for an immediate, peaceful end to this war.

We also call on Belarus to end its complicity in Putin’s invasion.

The decisions we take tomorrow will have far-reaching implications.

Major reinforcements to our security will require major investments in defence.

So I expect Allies will agree to redouble their efforts to invest more.

There is a new sense of urgency.

Because we cannot take peace for granted.

From the start of this crisis, Europe and North America have stood together, united in NATO.

And we remain united.

Opposing Russia’s aggression, supporting Ukraine, and protecting all Allies.

With that, I am ready to take your questions.

Natasha Bertrand (CNN): Mr Secretary General, Estonia has been calling for NATO to build up a permanent force in the region that is capable of stopping a Russian offensive, but the NATO-Russia Founding Act technically does not allow the Alliance to establish permanent military basing in so called new member states. And so I'm wondering if you believe that it's time to repeal the NATO-Russia Founding Act, given its invasion of Ukraine? And I'm also wondering, Estonia's defence chief had also said that NATO should get involved directly if Russia uses weapons of mass destruction, like chemical weapons, and I'm wondering if these kinds of red lines and how NATO would react if they were crossed, are going to be discussed?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: First of all, we have to remember that we, over the last weeks, have deployed a substantial number of combat-ready troops to the eastern part of the Alliance – unprecedented NATO presence in the Baltic region, including in Estonia. And I’ve been in Estonia myself and I've seen the NATO troops there. We have actually doubled the size of the NATO battlegroup, and we have doubled the number of battlegroups in the eastern part of the Alliance. So not only doubled the size but also doubled the number of battlegroups, close to 40,000 troops under direct NATO command and then on top of that, increased the presence by the United States and others within the bilateral arrangements. So in totality, this is a significant reinforcement of our presence in the east, including in Estonia, with air, sea and land forces. We are ready and we are there to protect and defend Allies, ready to respond massively to any potential threat or attack against any NATO Allied country. This has already happened. So this reinforcement has already taken place. And we will then also tomorrow make decisions and declare that we have deployed four more battlegroups to Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania.

Then there is the need to also address the more long term consequences. So in addition to what we have already done, I expect also Allied leaders tomorrow to agree a tasking to our military commanders to look into the more longer term consequences for our deterrence and defence. There is a need to reset our deterrence and defence, and I expect that to be a substantial increase in our presence for the long term. And we will do what is necessary to ensure that we protect and defend all Allies and ensure that NATO provides credible deterrence and defence to all countries including Estonia.

Russia has walked away from the NATO-Russia Founding Act. They have violated it again and again. They violated it clearly back in 2014 when they illegally annexed Crimea and started to destabilise eastern Ukraine. And they have violated it when they moved into Georgia in 2008. And of course, the invasion of Ukraine now is a blatant violation of the NATO-Russia Founding Act.

On chemical weapons: First of all, any use of chemical weapons would totally change the nature of the conflict. And it will be a blatant violation of international law and will have far reaching consequences. And I think that's the most important message to convey, that any use of chemical weapons is absolutely unacceptable, and will have far reaching consequences.

Andrea Mitchell (NBC): Secretary General, President Biden in leaving Washington just said that he believes that the use of chemical weapons by Russia in Ukraine is a real threat. You have just said that we cannot take peace for granted and there is no sign, certainly, that Vladimir Putin is taking diplomacy seriously. And here we have President Zelensky who will plead again with NATO for admission to NATO. If chemical weapons are used in Ukraine, how would it be morally acceptable for NATO to ignore President Zelensky’s plea for NATO admission?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: For NATO…?

Andrea Mitchell (NBC): For NATO admission, to ignore his plea to be admitted to NATO? Thanks.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: What we see in Ukraine now is really painful. It's horrific, and we see the brutal consequences of a full fledged invasion of a peaceful, independent sovereign nation. And that's also the reason why NATO Allies have stepped up support including with advanced air defence systems, anti-tank systems, different types of weapons, ammunition and we are providing unprecedented support to Ukraine. And this is actually… also comes on top of what we have done for many years, because NATO Allies have trained tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops since 2014. And they are now on the frontline fighting the invading forces. And it is first and foremost the courage of the Ukrainian forces and the Ukrainian people under the current leadership that has enabled them to resist and to fight back against the Russian invasion. But at the same time, the support they have received for many years has proven extremely important and critical. And I expect that when Allied leaders meet tomorrow, they will address how to further strengthen our support to Ukraine. NATO membership is not on the agenda. But support to Ukraine is absolutely on top of our agenda and will be one of the main issues to be addressed tomorrow.

Mark Stone (Sky News): Secretary General, thank you very much. Could you explain or could you outline how NATO defends itself against a nuclear attack? Because it's clear that on Russian state media, they are openly – propagandists, pundits, people close to the Kremlin – are now talking in pretty straight and stark terms about a nuclear attack. How does NATO defend itself against a nuclear attack? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: Russia must stop its nuclear sabre-rattling. This is dangerous and it is irresponsible. NATO is there to protect and defend all Allies and we convey a very clear message to Russia that a nuclear war cannot be won and should never be fought. And it just highlights the importance of ending the war in Ukraine because we need to do everything we can to prevent the war from escalating beyond Ukraine and becoming even more deadly and even more dangerous than what we see today. Any use of nuclear weapons will fundamentally change the nature of the conflict, and Russia must understand that a nuclear war should never been fought and they can never win a nuclear war. This is actually something that Russia has agreed to again and again. And the continued nuclear sabre-rattling from Russia, the nuclear rhetoric, is actually contradicting what they have stated in the UN and in other formats, agreeing that we should do whatever we can to prevent a nuclear conflict.

James Bays (Al Jazeera): Secretary General, staying with weapons of mass destruction. You said in your opening statement on chemical and biological weapons that you were thinking of equipment to protect Ukraine. Can you give us more details of what you're going to be proposing to the leaders tomorrow?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: So we have provided different types of support, also when it comes to different measures to protect against chemical weapons and I expect Allies to look into how they can step up and provide more equipment to protect and defend against chemical weapons. I don't think it's useful if I go into all the details, partly because Allies will discuss this tomorrow, but also partly because I think that when it comes to the details about exactly what kind of support we provide, it's actually not always the best thing to be too detailed about that. We provide support, we are stepping up our support, and we are concerned about the possibility of use of chemical weapons or biological weapons.

We also see not only the nuclear rhetoric from the Russian side, but also these false claims that Ukraine, supported by NATO Allies, are producing and preparing for the use of chemical weapons. This is an absolutely false accusation, but it may be a way for them to in a way try to create a pretext for their use of chemical weapons. Russia has used chemical agents before against their own opposition and also on NATO Allied territory in Salisbury. And Russia was, of course, part of the use of chemical weapons in Syria. They facilitated and supported the Assad regime, which has actually used chemical weapons several times. So we are concerned and that's also the reason why we are ready and we'll address tomorrow ways to provide support to Ukraine to protect themselves against the use of chemical weapons.

And let me add that of course this is extremely serious for the people of Ukraine. But any use of chemical weapons or biological weapons may also have dire consequences for NATO Allied countries, people living there – the contamination, the spread of chemical or biological agents used in Ukraine may have dire consequences also for the population living in NATO Allied countries in Europe. So it just underscores the seriousness of all our concerns.

Irina Somer (Interfax Ukraine): Secretary General, according to NATO and US officials, Belorussia is ready to send their troops into the war against Ukraine. What it will change for Ukrainians, and what it will change for NATO? And my second question is about coalition. Mass media already reported that Poland leadership are ready to put tomorrow for discussion a proposal to send a peacekeeping mission to Ukraine, they mentioned a NATO peacekeeping mission to Ukraine. But how about a coalition? Coming back to 2003, a coalition were created from three NATO Allies and one non-NATO country in Iraq. Do you think it will be a good solution to create a coalition of countries who wants to fight for Ukraine without NATO involvement? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: So first on Belarus. Belarus has been complicit to this invasion from the start, actually before the start, because Belarus allowed its territory to be used as a ground for mobilising and amassing troops that invaded Ukraine. And Belarus continues to enable the invasion by providing the territory, airfields, military infrastructure, bases, but also by allowing Russia to use Belarusian airspace to launch attacks every night, every day, against Ukrainian cities, again Ukrainian civilians, against the Ukrainian nation. So Ukraine, sorry Belarus, is already heavily involved in the way that it has been complicit and has supported the Russian invasion. And of course we call on Belarus to stop doing exactly that, and not be used by Russia to conduct this brutal war against a neighbour, Ukraine.

When it comes to forces – so NATO is not part of the conflict. We provide support to Ukraine, but we are not part of the conflict. We help Ukraine with upholding their right for self defence which is enshrined in the UN Charter. But NATO will not send troops into Ukraine. We have to understand that it is extremely important to provide support to Ukraine and we are stepping up, but at the same time it is also extremely important to prevent that this conflict becomes a full-fledged war between NATO and Russia. And therefore it has been a very clear message from NATO Allies that we will not send troops to Ukraine.

Beata Plomecka (Polske Radio): Secretary General, if I may ask again about enhancing the forward presence on the eastern flank. Is it the time to consider, or to decide, to enlarge the battalions that are in Baltic states and Poland into the brigade groups? And also follow up to the question concerning nuclear threats repeated again and again by Russia – is there any possibility for the leaders to prepare a kind of a plan, just in case? Thank you very much.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: First on the nuclear threat. NATO has plans in place to protect all Allies against any threat. But our main message is that Russia should stop this dangerous, irresponsible nuclear rhetoric. But let there be no doubt about our readiness to protect and defend Allies against any threat, any attack, and of course we have plans in place to do exactly that.

On the size: Well, first of all, before this invasion we had four battlegroups, battalion-sized. Now we have doubled the size of those battlegroups in Poland, in Lithuania, in Estonia and in Latvia. And then we have doubled the number of battlegroups with the new battlegroups in Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania which leaders will then announce tomorrow. And there are more… In Poland there are also additional troops from the US. I recently visited the Łask airbase, I met with US and other pilots. So there has been a significant increase of NATO Allies’, especially the United States, presence in the eastern part of the Alliance.

This is our immediate response, has already taken place. Then I think we need to separate that a bit from the more longer term adaptation of our Alliance. And we will spend some time now, from now until the summit in June, to make more fundamental decisions on our deterrence and defence. It's about resetting our deterrence and defence, especially in the east. And there I expect that a part of that will be a significant increase of our presence on the ground in the eastern part of the Alliance for the long term. So immediately we have done a lot. Then we will start the process of more long term changes in our deterrence and defence which will be lasting and most likely will then include also a significant increase of the size of the presence of the NATO multinational forces in the eastern part of the Alliance, including in Poland.

Ukrainian media: Secretary General, do you believe in the successful and fruitful summit tomorrow, taking on account the position of Hungary, as you know that they are going to block the main issues you will put on the table tomorrow concerning the help to Ukraine?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: Well, I believe it will be an important summit tomorrow, an extraordinary NATO summit in an extraordinary security situation where we face the biggest security threat for generations, since actually the end of the Second World War. And therefore I believe this is an important meeting and I'm confident that Allies will agree on important issues, including on the importance of providing support to Ukraine, strengthening our own deterrence and defence, and also provide support to other partners which are now under pressure from Russia, for instance Georgia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. And I expect all Allies to agree, all 30.

Lili Bayer (POLITICO): Thank you very much, Secretary General. Some NATO Allies have expressed an interest in having you potentially stay on for an extra year in your current role, given the current situation. Would you be open to staying in your current job another year? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: This is for 30 Allies to decide. My focus is on preparing the summit tomorrow in the midst of the most serious security situation we have been in for decades. And that's my focus and then I leave it to the Allies to decide on the other things.

Lailuma Sadid (Brussels Morning): I'm sorry, I know this is a very tough situation. I would like to ask a question about Afghanistan, which has disappeared from meetings and also from the news unfortunately. Actually today millions of girls and women were waiting to open the schools and universities in Afghanistan, but unfortunately, it's not happened. And I believe the Taliban as a terrorist group, they never change because they didn't cut their tie with al Qaeda and also with Haqqani network. So in a country the woman all disappear from the society and also there is no women’s rights, human rights, and also freedom of expression and also liberty at home. They are killing, raping and also torturing and imprison the people in Afghanistan. Why is it acceptable and attractive for EU and also for NATO? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: I think it is very important that we don't forget Afghanistan. And it is especially important that we don't forget that education is a fundamental human right. And of course that also applies for girls, for women. And it was one of the biggest achievements over the last 20 years that millions of Afghan girls were able to attend school and to get education. Any attempt to deny girls in Afghanistan education will be a violation of what the Taliban has promised. And we have to hold them accountable for what they promised and their commitments, including on the right for education to women. Therefore I agree with the disappointment expressed by the United Nations and I also strongly believe that we must continue to support all Afghans who are working to uphold the right for human rights, for the freedom of speech, but including also the right for education for women.

Henry Foy (Financial Times): Thank you so much. Secretary General, you mentioned China but do you personally consider China to be an ally of Russia in this conflict? And what would you like to see from NATO member states in terms of real actions that could pressure China into ceasing its support from Russia?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: So what we have seen is that China has not been able to condemn the invasion. They abstained in the UN General Assembly on the vote on the resolution clearly condemning the invasion. We have also seen that Chinese state authorities have spread some of the same lies about Ukraine and about NATO and in that way, probably the political support to Russia. And of course, for NATO, it is of particular concern that China now for the first time has questioned some of the key principles of our security, including the right for every nation in Europe to choose its own path. Because in the joint statement between President Xi and President Putin, they actually, together, stated that they are against any further enlargement of NATO and that is new. Partly that they work so closely together and partly that China joins Russia in trying to deny European nations the freedom to choose their own path. And therefore, we call on Russia, and I expect the leaders when they meet tomorrow, to call on China to condemn the invasion and to engage in diplomatic efforts to find a peaceful way to end this war as soon as possible and not providing material support.

Ukrainian State TV: Do you know about real Ukraine’s defence needs and do you have clear priorities on what Ukrainians need today? Do you know about the disappointment of Ukrainians in NATO now? And how do you explain your strategy to average people in Ukraine who are now under shelling in Kiev and another cities?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: What we see in Ukraine is horrific. It is painful, even for us to watch and of course it is even worse for those who are there. And the human suffering and the scale of violence is something we have not seen since the Second World War in Europe. NATO Allies are in close contact at different levels with Ukraine, with President Zelensky, with ministers. We had the Ukrainian Defence Minister participating in our defence ministerial last week. Tomorrow, President Zelensky will address the NATO Summit and as we all know, President Zelensky and other Ukraine officials are addressing different political bodies, in different countries across the Alliance, almost daily. And by doing that, and by having close contact at many different levels, we also are informed about the needs for different types of help, financial support, humanitarian support but also of course, military support. And Allies are stepping up with military, with financial, with humanitarian support.

Then, we are aware of, because this is something which President Zelensky and the Ukrainian officials have expressed several times to us that they are grateful for the support, but they want us to do even more. We are ready to step up in many ways but for instance, on the call for a no-fly zone, we have stated that we are not going to impose a no-fly zone because we believe that, that will most likely trigger a full-fledged war between NATO and Russia. A no-fly zone means that we need to take out Russian air defence systems in Russia, which are covering their airspace over Ukraine. And it means that we have to be ready to shoot down Russian planes. That will most likely lead to a full-fledged conflict. So we are in regular, almost daily, contact with Ukraine. Ukraine is a highly valued partner. We have worked with Ukraine for many years. I have been there many times myself, and it is horrific and really hard to watch. That is also reason why Allies have provided so much support but also have imposed unprecedented sanctions on Russia to ensure that this war ends.

Lorne Cook (AP): On the battle groups, please, for Hungary, Slovakia or Romania and Bulgaria. Could you give us a sense of when they are supposed to arrive? I imagine circumstances are urgent and how long they might stay? Is this something that we are looking at for several years or just until this conflict has died down? And within that there was a question I think Hungary didn't necessarily want other troops there. How is that going to work?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: These battlegroups are now actually there. We are increasing; they are becoming more and more integrated, and more and more operational. So the forces are, at last to the larger extent, already there. They are going to be NATO multinational battle groups. There will be of course, an important component of the national home defence forces who will be part of the battlegroup but then there will be other NATO Allies also contributing forces.

Again, this is part of our immediate reaction. So this is something which is happening now, together with all the other things we have done. Hundreds of thousands of NATO troops on heightened alert, roughly 100,000 US troops in Europe now; many of them in eastern part of the Alliance and that is significantly more than before the crisis. And then, around 40,000 NATO troops under direct NATO command and all of this is the immediate response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We will have that in place as long as necessary but in parallel with that we have started the process to reset for the long-term our deterrence and defence because it is already possible today to say that this invasion, this brutal war in Ukraine will have long term consequences for our security. It is a new normal for our security and NATO has to respond to that new reality. That more long-term process will take some more weeks but we can do that because we will have implemented a significant reinforcement of our presence in the East and in parallel of that, we are addressing more long-term changes, including most likely significant increased presence in the air, on land, at sea in eastern part of the Alliance.

Dan Michaels (Wall Street Journal): When you look at how successfully the Ukrainian troops have been able to hold back the Russians in many places, much to the surprise of the Russians apparently, partly thanks to training from NATO and NATO member states. Do you wish that over recent years NATO and its members had been able, actually, to do more? Do you feel that if more had been done, the situation could be different? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: First of all, I would like to commend the courage and the professionalism of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. I have met them in Ukraine and we are all aware that compared to where they were back in 2014, this is a totally different force than eight years ago. The Ukrainian Armed Forces today is much bigger, much better equipped, much better trained, much better commanded. They have much better logistics than they had back in 2014. And of course, all of this combined with the courage, the high morale, is the reason why they are really able to push back and to stand up against the much bigger Russian invasion.

At the same time, I think you need to remember that Ukraine is a big nation. It is the biggest country in Europe, and more than 44 million people. So it is a significant nation with a strong army and defence force. Of course, it is important that NATO Allies have provided support for many years, especially the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, but also some other Allies. I believe it is important to understand that NATO has also provided support on logistics, on command, on modernising their security institutions. The transformation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces has been supported by both NATO as an institution and for instance, Yavoriv, the place that was attacked is a place where we conducted training and support for Ukrainians. I have been there myself, and seen how NATO Allies and NATO, for many years, have provided important support. Of course, it is always, in hindsight, possible to say that we should have gone even more. But first of all, I think the lesson learned is that support and help for many years have a significant impact as it had on the Ukrainian Armed Forces. And second, I think it is also a lesson to be learned about the importance of supporting other partners, which are under Russian pressure.

Natalia Drozdiak (Bloomberg): I just want to go back to the topic of chemical weapons. You mentioned last week, that there was a risk that Russia could try to do this under the cover of a false flag event. And today, you are talking about Allies sending protective equipment. What can you tell us about the threat? How has it evolved? Is it becoming more urgent or imminent? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: We are concerned because we see the rhetoric. We see the attempts by Russia to create this pretext and accuse us and Ukraine for preparing the use of chemical weapons. And we are concerned because we know that Russia has used chemical agents before and they have supported Assad and facilitated the use of chemical weapons in Syria. At the same time, we are also open about our concerns to decrease the likelihood for the use of chemical weapons because that will fundamentally change the nature of the conflict. It will be a blatant violation of international law, and it will have severe consequences in a way that it is important to convey to Russia so they don't use any chemical weapons in Ukraine, both because any use of chemical weapons will have devastating consequences for Ukraine, but it could also have severe consequences for neighbouring countries because any contamination or spread of chemical agents or biological agents will, of course, also potentially affect the neighbours.

NATO Spokesperson Oana Lungescu: Thank you very much. This concludes this press conference.",https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_193610.htm

Good afternoon.

We have just finished an extraordinary summit of NATO leaders to address the biggest threat to our security in a generation:

President Putin’s war against Ukraine.

The people of Ukraine are resisting with courage and determination.

Fighting for their freedom and for their future.

We stand with them.

President Zelensky addressed us with an impassioned message.

Thanking NATO Allies for the significant support we are providing.

And stressing the vital importance of even more military assistance.

Today, NATO leaders agreed that we must and will provide further support to Ukraine.

We will continue to impose unprecedented costs on Russia.

And we will reinforce Allied deterrence and defence.

Leaders approved our four new NATO battlegroups.

In Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia.

These are in addition to the four already in the Baltic countries and Poland.

So we have eight multinational NATO battlegroups now.

From the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea.

Across Europe, there are one hundred thousand US troops supporting NATO efforts.

And European Allies and Canada have also stepped up.

We have 40,000 forces under direct NATO command, mostly in the eastern part of the Alliance.

Backed by major air and naval power.

Including an unprecedented five carrier strike groups from the High North to the Mediterranean.

Today, NATO leaders agreed to reset our deterrence and defence for the longer-term.

To face a new security reality.

On land, we will have substantially more forces in the eastern part of the Alliance, at higher readiness.

With more prepositioned equipment and supplies.

In the air, we will deploy more jets.

And strengthen our integrated air and missile defence.

At sea, we will have carrier strike groups, submarines and significant numbers of combat ships on a persistent basis.

We will also strengthen our cyber defences.

And enhance our exercises, focusing on collective defence and interoperability.

I expect we will decide on the details at our next Summit in Madrid in June.

Today, Allied leaders also agreed to provide further support to Ukraine.

Helping to uphold their fundamental right to self-defence.

Allies are also equipping Ukraine with significant military supplies.

Including anti-tank and air defence systems, and drones.

Which are proving highly effective.

As well as substantial financial and humanitarian aid.

Today, we agreed to do more.

Including cybersecurity assistance.

And equipment to help Ukraine protect against biological, chemical, radiological, and nuclear threats.

This could include detection, protection, and medical supplies, as well as training for decontamination and crisis management.

We are determined to do all we can to support Ukraine.

And I welcome the concrete offers of assistance made by Allies today.

At the same time, we have a responsibility to ensure the conflict does not escalate further. Because this would be even more dangerous and more devastating.

Allies agreed that we must also increase our support for other partners at risk from Russian threats and interference.

Including Georgia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Working together, and with the European Union, we must help them uphold their sovereignty and strengthen their resilience.

We also addressed Beijing’s role in the crisis.

Today, Allied leaders called on China to refrain from supporting Russia’s war effort.

China must not provide economic or military support for the Russian invasion.

Instead, Beijing should use its significant influence on Russia.

And promote an immediate, peaceful resolution.

Allies also agreed that Belarus must stop acting as an accomplice to Putin’s invasion.

At today’s meeting, leaders reaffirmed our strong commitment to NATO’s Open Door policy, under Article 10 of the Washington Treaty.

NATO enlargement has been an historic success.

Spreading democracy, freedom, and prosperity across Europe.

One month since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, NATO’s security environment has fundamentally changed.

For the long haul.

And we are responding.

But security does not come for free.

And doing more will cost more.

So NATO leaders agreed to redouble efforts to meet the Defence Investment Pledge we made in 2014.

Allies will submit additional plans on how to meet the pledge in time for the Madrid Summit in June.

And I welcome that a number of Allies today announced plans for significant increases in defence spending.

At this dangerous time, transatlantic unity and solidarity are vital.

Europe and North America are standing, and will continue to stand, strong together in NATO.

With that, I am ready to take your questions.

Natasha Bertrand (CNN): Hi, Mr Secretary General, thank you. President Zelensky in his address to NATO accused Russia of deploying phosphorus munitions. I am wondering whether NATO has seen evidence of that and what your response is or would be? And then I am wondering, did you discuss during this meeting a permanent basing of forces in any of these countries such as the Baltics and abandoning the NATO-Russia Founding Act?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: So we are resetting NATO’s deterrence and defence for the long term, with more troops, with more air assets and more maritime capabilities. We have already increased our presence in the east and today we decided on four new battlegroups. The leaders agreed to task our military commanders to provide options for a long-term reset of our presence, of our military posture in the eastern part of the Alliance and across the whole Alliance. Details will be then decided at our summit in June but that comes on top for what we have already done. So this is long term, we are prepared for long haul because we can already today say that the Russian invasion, President Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has changed our security environment for the long term. It is a new reality. It is a new normal and NATO is responding for the long term. We have seen very credible reports about the use of use of military force against civilians. Of course, this is a great concern for all NATO Allies.

NBC: Secretary General thank you for taking my question. How do you believe NATO will respond if China begins to support Russia economically and perhaps with military supplies? And also do you believe that there is a role to play for NATO when it comes to alleviating energy costs? And I'm talking about speaking directly to Saudi Arabia and other OPEC producers. Thank you.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: So NATO Allies are coordinating their efforts when it comes to also energy security. It was also addressed in the meeting today to step up supplies, to diversify sources of supply and also to reduce dependence on supplies from Russia and later today, I will also participate in the G7 meeting. In different frameworks, G7, working with the EU, there are different formats where NATO Allies address the need to strengthen energy security and reduce dependence on Russian oil and gas. Our message to China is that they should join the rest of the world and clearly condemn the brutal war against Ukraine and not support Russia and neither with economic support or with military support.

Irina Somer (Interfax Ukraine): I would like to ask you if Polish leadership put at the table today for discussion, the proposal to send peacekeeping mission to Ukraine and if yes what kind of discussion it was? And is there some conclusion? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: We discussed a wide range of issues and the message is that we have to stand united and also that we need to provide support to Ukraine. At the same time, we have a responsibility to ensure that this conflict does not become a full-fledged war between NATO and Russia. And that is also the reason why Allies have declared that we will not deploy troops on the ground in in Ukraine because the only way to do that is to be prepared to engage in full conflict with Russian troops.

Henry Foy (Financial Times): Thank you very much, Secretary General. Congratulations on your annual extension. You said in the statement that Allies agree to ‘enhance preparedness and readiness for chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats’. Is that based on credible intelligence that those threats could be imminent, and how does the Alliance strengthen its protection against those threats? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: So we are concerned, partly because we see the rhetoric and we see that Russia is trying to create some kind of pretext accusing Ukraine, United States, NATO Allies [of] preparing to use chemical and biological weapons. And we have seen before that this way of accusing others is actually a way to create a pretext for doing the same themselves. And of course, accusations against Ukraine and NATO Allies are absolutely false. Any use of chemical weapons will totally change the nature of the conflict. It will be a blatant violation of international law and it will have widespread consequences and, of course, be extremely dangerous. It will affect the people in Ukraine. But there's also a risk that it will have a direct effect on people living in NATO countries, because we can see contamination, we can see the spread of chemical agents or biological weapons into our countries. We also know that Russia has used chemical agents against its own opposition, and they have used it on NATO territory, in Salisbury, before. And we also know that Russia has facilitated, supported, the Assad regime in Syria when they used chemical weapons against their own population.

So this just highlights the importance of ending this war immediately because this is a dangerous situation and therefore we impose the sanctions, and therefore we support Ukraine. Allies agreed to supply equipment to help Ukraine protect against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats. This could include detection equipment, protection and medical support, as well as training for decontamination and crisis management. We are also enhancing Allies’ preparedness and readiness for chemical and biological and nuclear threats. Our top military commander, General Wolters, has activated NATO's chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defence elements, and Allies are deploying additional chemical and biological and nuclear defences to reinforce our existing and new battlegroups. So we are taking measures both to support Ukraine, and also to defend ourselves.

James Bays (Al Jazeera): President Zelensky, when he addressed… you recall the fact he first spoke to you a month ago, and he says he didn't get clear answers. So this time he asked you specifically for 1% of all your tanks, for 1% of all your aircraft, for multi-launch rocket systems, anti-ship weapons and means of air defence – a very specific list. What is your clear answer?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: We all listened very carefully to President Zelensky. And many of the leaders in the room have had contacts with him over these weeks. I also spoke with him and the Ukrainian defence minister participated in our defence ministerial meeting last week. We listened carefully. And of course, we took note of his very compassionate message to all NATO Allies.

NATO Allies provide significant support to Ukraine. And we provide also lethal weapons, advanced systems, and also systems that help them to shoot down planes and attack battle tanks with anti-tank weapons, and many other types of systems including drones. I will not go into the details of the exact type of systems we are deploying. There is close contact between NATO Allies and Ukraine. But what I can say is that Allies do what they can to support Ukraine with weapons so Ukraine can defend themselves. Self-defence is a right enshrined in the UN Charter.

At the same time, we have a responsibility to prevent this conflict from becoming a full-fledged war in Europe, involving not only Ukraine and Russia, but NATO Allies and Russia. That will be more dangerous and more devastating. And I think we have to be honest about that, and that's exactly what we have been in our meeting today, and also what I say to you in the press conference now.

James Bays (Al Jazeera): So again, no clear answer?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: Well, what we do is that we are delivering a lot of equipment, and that is an answer. But I will not go into the details. I don't think that's wise for operational reasons if I listed exactly what and when and how we are delivering essential equipment to Ukraine. NATO Allies have stepped up and it is essential for the progress they have been able to make in the fight against the invading Russian forces.

NATO Spokesperson Oana Lungescu: Thank you very much, colleagues. I know there are many questions. I'm afraid the Secretary General needs to go to the G7 meeting, but there will be other briefings throughout the day. Thank you so much.",https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_193613.htm

Good morning,

It is great to be back in Bardufoss.

And to meet forces taking part in Cold Response exercise.

A week ago, four US Marines lost their lives in a tragic plane crash.

Let me start by expressing my deepest condolences to their families and loved ones.

And to all their fellow soldiers who stand together to defend NATO territory.

I want to thank Norway for leading this important exercise.

Cold Response shows NATO unity and strength in action.

There are 30,000 personnel from 27 nations participating.

Including NATO’s closest partners, Finland and Sweden.

We have deployed 220 aircraft, including fifth-generation fighter jets.

And more than 50 ships, including two aircraft carrier groups from the United Kingdom and Italy.

Russia’s war against Ukraine is a watershed moment.

It is a new normal for European security. And also for Arctic security.

NATO is an Arctic Alliance.

4 out of 5 Arctic littoral states are NATO nations.

It is a region of strategic importance for the security of the entire Euro-Atlantic area.

And critical for the communication links between North America and Europe.

It is also a region of growing strategic competition.

In the last few years, we have seen a significant increase in Russian military activity here.

Russia has re-established Soviet era Arctic bases.

This is a test bed for many of Russia’s novel weapon systems.

It is the home of Russia’s strategic submarine fleet.

Russia’s military build-up is the most serious challenge to stability and Allied security in the High North.

We also see an increased Chinese interest in the region.

China has defined itself as a “near Arctic” state an aims to build a presence here.

For all of these reasons, the High North is an area of critical importance for all Allies.

This is why NATO Allies have increased their military presence in the North.

And this exercise is an example of that. More will be required in the future.

A strong, firm and predictable Allied presence is the best way to ensure stability and protect our interests.

We cannot afford a security vacuum in the High North.

It could fuel Russian ambitions, expose NATO, and risk miscalculation and misunderstandings.

Over the last years, NATO has stepped up.

Established a new NATO command for the Atlantic.

Exercised more often, with the two biggest exercises since the Cold War held in this region.

Allies such as the US, the UK, and Norway have been investing more in cutting-edge capabilities.

Showing greater presence at sea and in the air.

And we monitor developments in the region very closely and share information.

NATO presence is not to provoke a conflict but to prevent conflict, and to preserve peace.

Cold Response is a crucial exercise.

It demonstrates NATO’s ability to defend against any threat, from any direction.

This exercise is defensive and long-planned.

We are open and transparent.

As we are with all our exercises.

Norway invited all 57 members of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe to observe Cold Response.

But Russia declined that invitation.

At this dangerous time for our security, it is even more important that we exercise the readiness of our forces.

And our capacity to reinforce our troops across the Atlantic.

At the NATO Summit yesterday, Allies agreed to continue imposing costs on Russia and to further support our close partner Ukraine.

With additional military supplies.

As well as significant financial and humanitarian aid.

We also decided to start the reset of our defence and deterrence.

The first step is to deploy four new battlegroups to the East of our Alliance.

And I expect NATO leaders to agree further steps at our next Summit in June.

To keep our people safe.

(Inaudible) Journalist introduction: First of all I would like to ask you, how do you judge the Italian contribution to NATO? And then what can happen in case Russia will use in this conflict, in this war, Nuclear or chemical weapons?

Jens Stoltenberg NATO Secretary General: Italy is a highly valued NATO ally. It is a founding member of our Alliance and contributes in many different ways to our shared security; with maritime capabilities, with your presence in Kosovo, in Iraq, but not least, your contributions to our enhanced Forward Presence in the Baltic region.

And then of course, Italy is part of this exercise. Italy is in the high north with a carrier strike group, with hundreds of troops participating in this exercise, and also with other key capabilities. We really appreciate that strong Italian contribution to this exercise, demonstrating that the whole Alliance is taking part in exercise Cold Response, and that the high north matters for the whole Alliance. Italy in the south of the Alliance contributes to the security in the north of the Alliance, because the high north matters also for Italy, as it matters for all allies.

Any use of chemical weapons, or nuclear weapons will totally change the nature of the war in Ukraine. It will be absolutely unacceptable, and it will be a blatant violation of international law. And therefore, allies have also clearly stated that Russia should not use chemical, biological or of course nuclear weapons and it highlights also the importance of ending this senseless war. It is a dangerous war, it is a horrific war and it is important to end it as soon as possible. And that's reason why NATO Allies put pressure on Russia with unprecedented sanctions, and why we support Ukraine and why we also make sure that we do all we can to prevent an escalation of the conflict beyond Ukraine by increasing our military presence in eastern part of the Alliance.

(Inaudible) Journalist introduction: NATO has already established that it's going to, or announced, it is going to increase its presence in the eastern part of the alliance and now you speak about the high north and the need to increase its presence in the future. Could you be specific in which way it will increase its presence in the north? Will there be any talk about establishing new NATO bases closer to the Russian border into North?

NATO Secretary General: NATO is an arctic Alliance because we are in the Arctic. Four out of five littoral states to the Arctic Sea, to the polar sea, are NATO States; Canada, United States, Denmark and Norway. We have presence on our territory with our own national forces and also forces from all the NATO allied countries, that's the case for all NATO Allies because we are in the north.

Then we have increased our presence in the air and at sea. And then we see that different allies participate in different types of missions; surveillance, monitoring and also showing presence in the high north.

What we did at the summit yesterday was to task our military commanders to put forward proposals, so Allied leaders can make decisions in June and it's a bit early for me to preempt exactly the specific decisions they will take. But I expect that they will recommend, and that the Allies will agree, to both increase presence on land but also, of course, increase our naval capabilities, air carrier strike groups, submarines, warships, but also of course, more modern air capabilities including fifth generation aircraft and maritime surveillance aircraft.

These are capabilities which allies already invest in, but I see a need to escalate to do more and to do more together. And then this exercise demonstrates the types of capabilities and the type of activity we need to see more across the Alliance and I expect the allies to make decisions on the more concrete details when they meet later on this year.

(Inaudible) Journalist introduction: I just wanted to know your thoughts about, how specifically has the situation in Ukraine affected this exercise here in the in the north? And also if you can say something about; you mentioned that Russia has declined to be an observer, how problematic is that at this point?

NATO Secretary General: This exercise is long planned, but it has become even more important after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Because it demonstrates the need for allies to stand together. It demonstrates the need to everyday provide credible deterrence and defense; not to provoke a conflict but to prevent the conflict. As long as there is no room for misunderstanding in Moscow about NATO Allies readiness to protect and defend every inch of NATO territory, then there will be no attack. There'll be no war, there will be no conflict. So the purpose of deterrence is to prevent war, to preserve peace.

But then the deterrence has to be credible and to ensure that our deterrence is credible, we need exercises like Cold Response, demonstrating a capability to protect and defend, demonstrate the capability to reinforce quickly if needed, and demonstrate the unity of NATO allies across the Alliance, including working with two highly valued partners, Finland and Sweden. And that's exactly what this exercise does. And therefore Cold Response is an important exercise, not least in the light of the meaningless and senseless Russian attack on Ukraine.

For us it is important, especially now when we see increased tensions, more military activities, to prevent incidents, accidents, miscalculations and if incidents or accidents happen, at least to ensure that they don't spiral out of control and create really dangerous situations. And that is the reason why NATO so strongly supports the agreements we have, including something called the Vienna Document, which is an agreement among all the nations in Europe on transparency, mutual observations of exercises, notification of exercises, to ensure that when you have big exercises like this one, that there are no misunderstandings or incidents caused by that exercise.

We are always transparent. We plan and notify our exercises and invite other countries to observe. Therefore, we regret of course, that Russia declined to observe this exercise. But we regret even more that Russia never invites us to take part in mandatory observation inspections on their exercises. And you have to remember that the invasion they now conduct, or the war their President Putin, wages against Ukraine, was in the beginning disguised as an exercise. They told us that this is just an exercise and they repeated that again and again and again, and then suddenly the exercise turned into a full fledged war.

Every nation has the right to exercise its own forces on its own territory. But it is extremely important that we are transparent, predictable on everything we do related to big military exercises like this one. We are, but Russia has never lived up to their commitments in the Vienna document to be transparent on military exercises.

(Inaudible) Journalist introduction: How is cooperating with Sweden and Finland different from cooperating with NATO countries?

NATO Secretary General: NATO has a very close cooperation with Finland and Sweden and we have strengthened that cooperation in the light of the war in Ukraine, President Putin's invasion of Ukraine. We exercise together, we operate together, we exchange information and we have political consultations, and Finland and Sweden participate regularly in NATO exercises and they are part of the Cold Response exercise, as they were part of the Trident Juncture exercise and many other exercises.

To reinforce even more the close cooperation between NATO and Finland and Sweden, there is also a Nordic defense cooperation with even more joint activities, consultations and especially for instance, the air Force is exercising throughout the airspace in Norway, Finland and Sweden. This is important for NATO. It's also important for Finland and Sweden, and of course something we very much welcome. But of course, there will always be a difference between an ally and a close partner, Finland and Sweden; they are close partners, but not full members. We respect that decision. It is a sovereign Finnish and Swedish decision to decide whether they want to join NATO or not and of course it's extremely important to convey a clear message that we respect the sovereign decision of Finland and Sweden to be close partners but not be members.

Journalist from TV2: You have said that NATO members must invest more in their defense. One year ago NATO criticized Norway for not investing enough in our own defense. How do you consider the Norwegian defense today regarding the situation in Ukraine?

NATO Secretary General: All NATO allies, have over the last years, increased defense spending. I welcome that because we made the decision to get the NATO allies in 2014, at the Wales summit, the NATO Summit, then and that was after the Russian illegal annexation of Crimea, then allies realized that we actually face a more dangerous world and after years of reducing defense spending, after the end of the Cold War, NATO Allies decided that we need to invest more.

Norway and other allies have increased defense spending since 2014, following up our decision so I welcome that. And I welcome that Norway is acquiring new modern capabilities, including maritime patrol aircrafts, fifth generation aircrafts and many other types of modern military capabilities. I expect allies to do more, both to meet the 2% guideline but even go further, and therefore expect that Norway as all other NATO allies, who are not at 2%, to continue and step up and at least spend a minimum of 2% on defence.

(Inaudible) Journalist introduction: Last Monday (inaudible) we ask (inaudible) what Sweden will do if Norway was attacked from Russia and she confirmed that Sweden would stand along with Norway. Recently, President Putin has threatened Finland and Sweden if they look to NATO. My question is, if Sweden and Finland is attacked, or threatened, what will NATO do?

NATO Secretary General: NATO has a very close partnership with Finland and Sweden. We work together with them, we operate together with them. There are no other countries in the world which are closer partners to NATO, then Finland and Sweden. We share the same neighborhood, we share the same security challenges and we are together in condemning, for instance, the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

But of course there is a difference between being member and not being member. NATO allies have a treaty obligation the Washington Treaty, our founding treaty, to protect and defend all allies. That's Article Five, that states clearly that if one ally is attacked, it will be regarded as an attack on the whole Alliance; on all allies, it will trigger a response from the whole Alliance. That's our collective defense clause, that's one for all, all for one. That absolute security guarantee applies for members. It doesn't apply for non-members of NATO. So therefore, what I can say is that Sweden are close partners, their security of course matters for us, but the absolute security guarantees that we provide for NATO allies, are only for NATO allies.

Martina Colt from Information in Denmark: Is NATO strong enough in the Baltic Sea area with what has already been done, or do we need to do more there now? Are there any concrete plans of increasing NATO presence?

NATO Secretary General: We have significantly increased our presence in the Baltic region over the last few years and especially in the last weeks. After the illegal annexation of Crimea back in 2014 by Russia, we established for the first time in NATO's history, combat ready battlegroups in the three Baltic countries and Poland. We also increased air policing and naval presence. This is something that has taken place since 2014.

Then when we saw the intelligence, the warnings about a potential Russian invasion into Ukraine, we stepped further up and since the invasion we have added even more. There are now hundreds of thousands of troops, not in the Baltic region but across the Alliance which are on heightened alert, and we have 100,000 US troops in Europe, which is a significant increase. And then we have 40,000 troops on the direct NATO command supported by substantial sea, Navy, as in air and maritime capabilities.

A large part of our increased presence in the eastern part of the Alliances is actually in the Baltic region. For instance, the United Kingdom has doubled the size of the NATO battlegroup in Estonia; Germany has doubled the size of the battlegroup in Lithuania and we also have a significant increase of our presence in Latvia and more maritime presence. And then we have the ability to reinforce because of more forces on high readiness.

We have already done a lot in that region, partly as a long term response to what happened in 2014 and partly as an imminent response to the invasion of Ukraine. We have enough forces now to be able to protect and defend all allies. But we will, of course, always assess the need to further reinforce and we have tasked our military commanders, that was the decision that was taken at the NATO summit yesterday, to look into the more longer term consequences. The need to more fundamentally reset. So this has been kind of the imminent response, what we have seen over the last weeks, but I expect that we will have some more fundamental decisions on the strength, on the type of presence, but these are decisions we'll take a bit later at the Summit in June.

(Inaudible) Journalist introduction: How do you think the effects of the war in Ukraine will look forward and do you think these effects will affect the northern areas and more specifically the defense of Norway?

NATO Secretary General: Putin’s war against Ukraine has fundamentally changed the security reality in Europe and it has created a new normal for our security. So even if the war ended tomorrow, it will have some lasting effects. Because what we have seen is that Russia is willing to contest core principles for our security. Contest the right for every nation to choose his own path.

They are denying Ukraine the right to go the way they want to go as a sovereign, independent nation. Russia is also contesting NATO's right to protect and defend all allies because in the demands they put forward before the invasion they also demanded that NATO should remove all infrastructure and all forces from the eastern part of the Alliance, meaning that almost half of NATO members could not be defended and protected the same way as the rest. All allies who joined after 1997 could not have the same type of protection. Meaning that we were going to have some kind of Second Class NATO membership. Those who joined after and before 1997.

So Russia has contested core principles of our security, and they have demonstrated their will to use military force to meet their objectives, to get what they want. This is a more dangerous security environment than we have seen for decades. And this is reflected in the most brutal war we have seen in Europe since the Second World War. And that's the reason why we need to fundamentally rethink, reset our deterrence and defence to make sure that we, in this more dangerous world, are providing the same predictable, stable, reliable deterrence, as NATO has done for many years.

We have started that process, exactly what the conclusions will be well, that will be for Allies to decide later on. We are taking a lot of imminent steps and then we need to continue the adaptation of NATO. NATO is the most successful alliance in history because we have been able to stand united and change when the world is changing. Now the world is changing, and therefore NATO has to change again.",https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_193681.htm

First and foremost, the Secretary General chairs the North Atlantic Council - the Alliance’s principal political decision-making body - as well as other senior decision-making committees. These include the Nuclear Planning Group, the NATO-Russia Council and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council. Additionally, together with a Ukrainian representative, the Secretary General chairs the NATO-Ukraine Commission, as well as the NATO-Georgia Commission.

Above and beyond the role of chair, the Secretary General has the authority to propose items for discussion and use their good offices in case of disputes between member states. They act as a decision facilitator, leading and guiding the process of consensus-building and decision-making throughout the Alliance.

The Secretary General maintains direct contact with heads of state and government, foreign and defence ministers in NATO and partner countries, in order to facilitate this process. This entails regular visits to NATO and partner countries, as well as bilateral meetings with senior national officials when they visit NATO Headquarters.

Effectively, their role allows them to exert some influence on the decision-making process while respecting the fundamental principle that the authority for taking decisions is invested only in the member governments themselves.

Principal spokesperson

The Secretary General is also the principal spokesperson of the Alliance and represents the Alliance in public on behalf of the member countries, reflecting their common positions on political issues.

They also represent NATO vis-à-vis other international organisations as well as to the media and the public at large. To this end the Secretary General regularly holds press briefings and conferences as well as public lectures and speeches.

Stoltenberg tweeted Thursday that he is “honored” by the decision of NATO leaders to extend his term until Sept. 30, 2023.

“As we face the biggest security crisis in a generation, we stand united to keep our alliance strong and our people safe,” he said.

WATCH: President Biden speaks with reporters in Brussels amid Russian invasion of Ukraine

The former Norwegian prime minister was named to NATO’s top civilian post in October 2014. It’s the second time that his term of office has been extended. His mandate was due to expire in September.

In February, Norway’s government appointed Stoltenberg as head of the Scandinavian country’s central bank and said it hoped he could start in his new role around Dec. 1.

In Oslo, Finance Minister Trygve Slagsvold Vedum confirmed that Stoltenberg had resigned from the job. Deputy governor Ida Wolden Bache has been nominated in Stoltenberg’s place and her appointment is expected to be confirmed later Thursday.

“Of course I would like to see Jens Stoltenberg become our next central bank governor, but we are in the middle of a dramatic situation in Europe and I have great understanding that he prioritizes continuing in the important role he has in NATO,” Slagsvold Vedum said.

Stoltenberg, 63, has described Russia’s war on Ukraine as “the most serious security situation we have been in for decades.”

Stoltenberg has been praised for steering NATO through a difficult and divisive period under the Trump administration, when the U.S. threatened not to come to the aid of member countries that weren’t spending enough on defense.

Speaking to reporters on an Air Force One flight to Brussels on Wednesday, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that President Joe Biden “thinks very highly of Secretary-General Stoltenberg.”

“They’ve developed a relationship of trust,” Sullivan said. “Secretary-General Stoltenberg has played an instrumental role in helping secure the powerful unity you’ve seen at NATO through this crisis.”

Stoltenberg was twice prime minister in Norway — from 2005 to 2013 and from 2002 to 2014 — and he also served as finance minister, and industry and energy minister.

In Oslo, Finance Minister Trygve Slagsvold Vedum confirmed that Stoltenberg had resigned from the job. Temporary governor Ida Wolden Bache has been nominated in his place and her appointment is expected to be confirmed later Thursday.

“Of course I would like to see Jens Stoltenberg become our next central bank governor, but we are in the middle of a dramatic situation in Europe and I have great understanding that he prioritizes continuing in the important role he has in NATO,” Slagsvold Vedum said.

Stoltenberg, 63, has described Russia’s war on Ukraine as “the most serious security situation we have been in for decades.”

Stoltenberg has been praised for steering NATO through a difficult and divisive period under the Trump administration, when the U.S. threatened not to come to the aid of member countries that weren’t spending enough on defense.

Speaking to reporters on an Air Force One flight to Brussels on Wednesday, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Biden and Stoltenberg have “developed a relationship of trust.”

“Secretary-General Stoltenberg has played an instrumental role in helping secure the powerful unity you’ve seen at NATO through this crisis,” Sullivan said

Stoltenberg was twice prime minister in Norway — from 2000 to 2001 and then again from 2005 to 2013 — and he also served as finance minister, and industry and energy minister.

Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre told Norwegian news agency NTB that Stoltenberg had done “a solid job” as NATO chief. “Never before has the alliance been stronger, and never before in the alliance’s history has unity been more important.”

Wolden Bache was due to be formally be named the central bank chief later Thursday for a six-year term.

“Norges Bank has great respect for Mr Stoltenberg’s decision made in the light of his very important responsibilities as Secretary General of NATO,"" she said.

Prior to Thursday’s announcement, speculation had been rife that a woman would be named at the helm of the world’s biggest security organization for the first time.

BRUSSELS (AP) — With the threat of wider conflict hanging over Europe, NATO opted for stability on Thursday by extending Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg’s term in office for an extra year to help steer the 30-nation military alliance through the security crisis sparked by Russia’s war on Ukraine.

Stoltenberg tweeted Thursday that he is “honored” by the decision of NATO leaders to extend his term until Sept. 30, 2023.

“As we face the biggest security crisis in a generation, we stand united to keep our alliance strong and our people safe,” he said, after U.S. President Joe Biden and his counterparts agreed to extend his term at a summit in Brussels.

The former Norwegian prime minister was named to NATO’s top civilian post in October 2014. It’s the second time that his term of office has been extended. His mandate was due to expire in September.
