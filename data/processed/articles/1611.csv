IAEA concerned about Chornobyl safety despite reparations

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has expressed concern over the safety of the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP), despite news of the resumption of external electricity supplies following the reparation of a damaged power line.

The plant is working on back-up diesel generators and will be reconnected to the Ukrainian electricity grid in the morning on Monday, according to IAEA.

Zelenskyy warns against ‘pseudo-republics’

Russia is trying to create new “pseudo-republics” in Ukraine to break his country apart, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said in his nightly address to the nation.

Zelenskyy has called on Ukraine’s regions, including Kherson, which was captured by Russian forces, not to repeat the experience of Donetsk and Luhansk. Pro-Russian separatists began fighting Ukrainian forces in those eastern regions in 2014.

“The occupiers on the territory of the Kherson region are trying to repeat the sad experience of the formation of pseudo-republics,” Zelenskyy said. “They are blackmailing local leaders, putting pressure on deputies, looking for someone to bribe.”

City council members in Kherson, a southern city of 290,000, on Saturday rejected plans for a new pseudo-republic, Zelenskyy said.

“Ukraine will stand this test. We need time and strength to break the war machine that has come to our land,” he said.

The United Kingdom will pay people to open their homes to Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion as the government moves to deflect anger about its response to the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.

The new scheme, called “Homes for Ukraine”, will let refugees from the war come to the UK even if they do not have family ties, the government said.

The country will pay people 350 pounds ($456) a month if they can offer refugees a spare room or property for a minimum period of six months.

Medical train carries Ukrainian children with cancer

About 60 children – cancer patients from Ukraine – have boarded a medical train in a Polish town, bound for hospitals in Warsaw and elsewhere.

Medical workers carried some young patients in their arms, on stretchers and in a wheelchair at a station in Medyka, near the Ukrainian border.

“Some of them will require oxygen, will require some form of intensive care, and some have COVID-19 and have to be kept separate from others,” said Dominik Daszuta, an anaesthetist from Warsaw Hospital. He said the train has transported 120 children with cancer so far.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) says at least 2.5 million people have fled Ukraine in the two weeks since the Russian invasion started.

Ukraine says people who died in Russian attack on convoy not in evacuation corridor

The seven women and children who Ukraine says died when Russian forces attacked a convoy escaping a village in the Kyiv region on Saturday were not – as previously stated – in an agreed-upon evacuation corridor, the defence ministry said.

Ukraine’s intelligence service initially said those who died outside Peremoha had been in a “green corridor” agreed with Russia.

A defence ministry statement later said people had in fact tried to escape by themselves, “so they began evacuating without the ‘green corridor’ agreed by the parties”.

Inside Story: Is Facebook abandoning its hate speech policy?

Meta Platforms Inc, the company that owns Facebook and Instagram, could soon be banned in Russia as an “extremist organisation”.

The Russian move comes in response to Meta announcing a change in its hate speech policy, allowing violent posts in some instances.

There is now a partial exception when the targets are Russian soldiers in Ukraine. Users are even allowed to call for Putin’s death.

But what are the consequences of this change in policy?

Ukraine says Russia plans to control Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant: IAEA

The United Nations nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has said it was told by Ukraine that Russia was planning to take full and permanent control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s biggest, but that Russia had later denied this.

“The President of Ukraine’s nuclear power plant operator Energoatom, Petro Kotin, said in a letter to the Director General that around 400 Russian soldiers were ‘being present full time on site’ [at Zaporizhzhia],” the IAEA said in a statement.

The IAEA said the Ukrainian regulator had also informed it that efforts to repair damaged power lines at the Chernobyl nuclear plant were continuing and that diesel generators were providing backup power to systems relevant for safety.

About 13,000 people were evacuated from a number of Ukrainian cities on Saturday, said Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk, almost twice the number who managed to get out the previous day.

Vereshchuk said in an online message that no one had managed to leave the besieged city of Mariupol and blamed obstruction by Russian forces. Moscow had earlier accused Ukrainian forces of intentionally trapping people there.

The clergy of the Russian Orthodox Church in the Dutch city of Amsterdam has announced it will split from the Moscow church because of threats to them over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

In a statement posted to its website, it said that after a meeting “the clergy unanimously announced that it is no longer possible for them to function within the Moscow Patriarchate and provide a spiritually safe environment for our faithful”.

It was “with a heavy heart” that the four priests of Saint Nicholas of Myra in Amsterdam had reached their decision, they said.

Sweden official dismisses Russian NATO warning

Sweden’s foreign minister has dismissed fresh warnings from Russia that the Nordic country’s joining NATO would lead to retaliatory measures from Moscow.

Foreign Minister Ann Linde told Swedish news agency TT “Russia has nothing to do with our independent decisions”, referring to Stockholm’s possible move to join NATO.

Russia’s Interfax news agency on Saturday quoted a Russian Foreign Ministry official saying the possible accession of Sweden and neighbouring Finland to NATO would have serious military and political consequences.

Satellite images show fires, severe damage to residential buildings in Mariupol

Satellite images taken on Saturday morning showed extensive damage to civilian infrastructure and residential buildings throughout the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, a private United States company said.

Maxar Technologies said fires were seen in the western section of the Black Sea port city and dozens of high-rise apartment buildings had been severely damaged. The images could not be independently verified.

Mariupol is facing what Ukraine says is a “humanitarian catastrophe”, with more than 1,500 civilians killed over 12 days.

A top Russian officer described the situation in the country in similarly stark language.

“Unfortunately, the humanitarian situation in Ukraine is continuing to deteriorate rapidly, and in some cities, it has reached catastrophic proportions,” said the head of the Russian National Defence Control Centre, Mikhail Mizintsev.

The UN has cited reports of “looting and violent confrontations” among civilians over the few resources available.

Russia-Ukraine war military dispatch: March 12, 2022

Kyiv is braced for an all-out Russian assault as fighting intensifies on the outskirts of the Ukrainian capital.

Air raid sirens were sounded in almost all regions of Ukraine on Saturday. The cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol remain surrounded and are under heavy Russian bombardment.

Meanwhile, Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Moscow will treat Western arms shipments to Ukraine as legitimate military targets.

Here were the main military developments on Saturday – the 17th day of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

US rushing $200m worth of weapons for Ukraine

The US has said it would rush up to $200m in additional small arms, anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons to Ukraine, as Ukrainian officials pleaded for more equipment to defend against heavy shelling by Russian forces.

US President Joe Biden on Saturday authorised the additional security assistance, the White House said, paving the way for the “immediate” shipment of fresh military equipment to Ukraine, a senior administration official said.

Biden’s decision brings total US security aid provided to Ukraine to $1.2bn since January 2021, and to $3.2bn since 2014, when Russia annexed the Crimea region of Ukraine, according to senior administration officials.

Liudmila Denisova, Ukraine’s human rights ombudswoman, claimed on Sunday that Moscow had used banned phosphorus munitions in an overnight attack on the town of Popasna in eastern Luhansk region.

She shared a photograph purporting to show the alleged attack, but did not reveal further evidence that would confirm it. “The bombing of a civilian city by the Russian attackers with these weapons is a war crime and a crime against humanity according to the Rome Convention,” she said in a statement.

Oleksi Biloshytsky, head of police in Popasna, around 60 miles west of Luhansk city, said late on Saturday that Russian forces had used phosphorus shells in the region, but the claims have not yet been independently verified.

White phosphorus munitions are not considered a chemical weapon under the Chemical Weapons Convention, and their primary aim is to create thick smoke that can hide military forces or mark targets. However, the substance burns fiercely and can cause horrendous injuries, and international law prohibits the use of white phosphorus shells in heavily populated civilian areas.

On Sunday, Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned that Russia could use chemical weapons following its invasion of Ukraine and that such a move would be a war crime.

Mr Stoltenberg suggested that Russia’s recent “absurd claims about chemical and biological weapons laboratories” in Ukraine could indicate that Vladimir Putin is planning to use these as a pretext for such attacks.

It echoed fears raised by the UK and US this week that the Kremlin could be setting the stage to use chemical weapons in Ukraine after officials alleged without evidence that the US had been supporting a bioweapons programme in the country.

“In recent days, we have heard absurd claims about chemical and biological weapons laboratories,” Mr Stoltenberg told German newspaper Welt am Sonntag. “Now that these false claims have been made, we must remain vigilant because it is possible that Russia itself could plan chemical weapons operations under this fabrication of lies. That would be a war crime.”

James Heappey, the UK armed forces minister, hit out at the Kremlin for its “insulting” attempt to blame Ukraine for the use of chemical weapons which in fact Russia itself was considering.

UK technology minister Chris Philp told Times Radio that the use of chemical weapons “would be an outrage against humanity and would trigger a “dramatic increased response” from the West.

A senior Government source told i on Friday that the UK could ramp up sanctions in response to any chemical attack.

Western officials said at a briefing this week that they had “good reason to be concerned” about possible use of non-conventional weapons by Russia, after chemical weapons were allegedly used by the Russia-backed Syrian regime during the country’s civil war.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki tweeted on Wednesday that “we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false-flag operation using them”, following Moscow’s false propaganda, which she said was seemingly endorsed by China.

Earlier on Wednesday, Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova had claimed Russia had evidence that the US had supported a bioweapons programme in Ukraine, involving plague, cholera and anthrax. Ms Psaki described the claims as “preposterous”.

Russia’s defence ministry also accused “Ukrainian nationalists” of preparing a chemical weapons “provocation” in a village north-west of Kharkiv in order to falsely accuse Russian forces of using them.

Poland’s President Andrzej Duda said on Sunday that the use of chemical weapons in Ukraine by Russia would be a “game-changer” and Nato would have to think seriously about how to respond.

“For sure, the North Atlantic alliance and its leaders led by the United States will have to sit at the table and they will really have to think seriously what to do because then it starts to be dangerous,” he told the BBC.",https://inews.co.uk/news/world/russia-accused-phosphorus-bomb-attacks-ukraine-nato-chief-chemical-weapons-war-crime-1514645

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.
