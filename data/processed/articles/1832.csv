1,cfc2799d-4dc7-4579-84b1-3d9b996d9a12,['Author'],,"Timeline: day 36 of Ukraine's defense against Russian aggression

Today, March 31, Russia's military attack on Ukraine has been going on for thirty-six days. We're reporting on all the current news.

What about today?

Key points

In the Donetsk and Luhansk directions, 5 enemy attacks were repulsed in the last 24 hours. Our soldiers destroyed 10 tanks, 18 armored and 13 units of vehicles, 15 artillery systems. The enemy suffered casualties.

The Armed Forces of Ukrainian Armed Forces destroyed 4 planes, UAVs, and 2 cruise missiles in the past 24 hours. Air Force aircraft continue to launch missile and bomb strikes on places of accumulation of Russian equipment and the enemy manpower.

Total enemy losses since the beginning of the full-scale invasion:

About 17,500 occupiers have already gone to hell. The Armed Forces turned these into scrap metal:

tanks – 614 units,

armored combat vehicles – 1735 units,

artillery systems – 311 units,

MLRS – 96 units,

air defense means – 54 units,

aircraft – 135 units,

helicopters – 131 units,

automotive equipment – 1201 units,

ships / boats – 7 units,

fuel tanks – 75,

UAV of operational and tactical level – 83.

Special equipment – 22.

OTRK / TRK launchers – 4.

We believe in the Armed Forces! We continue to destroy the enemy!

The Russians themselves accidentally shot down one of their planes in Ukraine, according to British electronic intelligence. There would be more such ""cases.""

The United Nations Office on Human Rights confirms that the Russians used cluster munitions in populated areas at least 24 times.

Also, the Chairman of the UN Human Rights Council Federico Villegas announced the establishment of an international independent commission to investigate war crimes in Ukraine. It is due to report on its work in September 2022.

The meeting of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Dmytro Kuleba with the President of Poland Andrzej Duda will take place today.

Humanitarian corridors

The Ukrainian and Russian parties, with the mediation of the International Committee of the Red Cross, agreed on a humanitarian corridor for the evacuation of Mariupol residents. As the Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine Iryna Vereshchuk said this morning, 45 buses will be involved in the evacuation, some of them have already left for Mariupol.

In addition, as of March 31, 2 humanitarian corridors in the Zaporizhzhia region have been agreed upon:

Melitopol – Zaporizhzhia

Enerhodar – Zaporizhzhia

Russia has declared a ceasefire on March 31 starting from 10:00 to evacuate residents from humanitarian corridors. There is no trust in the occupiers, but we hope that today all the announced green corridors will work.

Today, March 31, 2022, there is no evacuation in the Kyiv region. There are no officially agreed-on humanitarian corridors in the region.

Ukraine's talks with Russia

Negotiations between Russia and Ukraine may continue online on April 1. This was announced by Davyd Arakhamia on Ukraine 24 TV channel. According to him, Ukraine expects to develop a draft agreement in a week, which can be discussed by the presidents of the countries.

14:30 – Media reports that Erdogan has announced plans to hold talks with Zelenskyy and Putin. This week, the President of Turkey intends to raise the issue of organizing a quick meeting of the heads of Ukrainian and Russian states.

However, Putin himself believes that the conditions for a ceasefire in Ukraine have not yet been created. At least that's what he told Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi in a telephone conversation. This was announced by Draghi at a press conference on Thursday, the EP reports with reference to Reuters.

Nuclear objects

Russian troops begin to leave the Chornobyl nuclear power plant. This was reported by sources in the Pentagon. So far, only part of the troops has left the station.

The IAEA will send nuclear safety equipment to Ukraine. The IAEA is also organizing several missions to support the Ukrainian side: at the Zaporizhzhya NPP and the Chornobyl NPP, these will be online missions. Other stations will set up emergency teams of experts who will go to the scene in case of threat to ""prevent acts of aggression, as at ZNPP.""

Who's coming to Ukraine?

About financial aid, weapons, and volunteer fighters

The United States has already sent a new batch of weapons to Ukraine. U.S. Department of Defense spokesman John Kirby said on the night of March 31: ""Deliveries are coming to the region every day, including the last 24 hours. We have already shipped the top 50 cargo planes out of about 30 within the $800 million received by the president."" Kirby stressed that the shipments include weapons that Ukrainian forces need most, including anti-tank and anti-aircraft systems.

Norwegian authorities sent 2,000 M72 anti-tank grenade launchers to Ukraine. This decision was made after the speech of the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Norwegian Parliament.

Ukraine will be able to buy weapons from German defense companies. Preliminarily, the purchase of weapons and equipment worth €300 million has already been agreed upon. In total, about 200 items are on the list and some of them will be delivered as soon as possible.

The Spanish government has already sent ten offensive planes to Ukraine. This was stated by Spanish Defense Minister Margarita Robles.

Assistance to refugees

Italy will give Ukrainians who have left their homes a residence permit for one year. In addition, refugees will have access to health care, the labor market, education, and some social benefits. Ukrainians will also be able to receive 300 euros for three months.

News from partners

Lithuania has included Russia and Belarus in the list of hostile countries.

Ambassador of Ukraine to Poland, Andrii Deshchytsia, said that Ukraine was negotiating with Poland on the possibility of completely closing the border with Belarus. According to the ambassador, the diplomatic mission is negotiating with the Polish Ministry of Infrastructure and the Polish government. The primary goal is to close the border with Belarus by 100%. However, even if this decision is not taken at the level of the European Union. Andrii Deshchytsia also stressed that diplomats from Ukraine were discussing similar issues with the Baltic states.

Germany is ready to provide security guarantees to Ukraine, but after the end of hostilities, said German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerboсk.

And this is Denmark playing with the Netherlands. Thank you for your solidarity with the Ukrainian people!

Russian nuclear planes violated Swedish airspace. Sweden believes that this was intimidation.

What's in Russia?

Unrecognized South Ossetia will soon take legal steps to join Russia. Reunification with Russia is the country's strategic goal. This was stated by the President of South Ossetia Bibilov. Prior to that, the leader of the so-called ""LPR"" Leonid Pasichnyk stated the same intentions, but he was told by Russia that ""now is not the time.""

Self-proclaimed Abkhazia abandoned the idea of ​​joining Russia.

Meanwhile, soldiers from South Ossetia refused to ""liberate"" Donbas and returned home. The information was confirmed by the former President of South Ossetia Eduard Kokoity. He said that ""it is not necessary to condemn the military,"" but it is necessary to ""understand the reasons for what happened."" Ossetian blogger Alik Pukhayev also said that 300 servicemen refused to fight voluntarily: ""Today, about 300 servicemen (mostly ethnic Ossetians) from a Russian military base returned to South Ossetia voluntarily because they thought they had been left to die during a 'special operation' in Ukraine,"" he wrote. And rightly so.

13:00 – Georgia reacted to South Ossetia's statement on holding a referendum on joining Russia: ""Talks on a referendum in South Ossetia are unacceptable,"" said the Georgian Foreign Minister.

Putin ""turned on the back"" about paying for gas in rubles. The aggressor country will not require Europeans to pay for gas supplies in rubles. They will be able to pay in euros.

From 1 April 2022, it will be possible to apply for all types of visas to France, including tourist visas, without restrictions related to COVID-19. This was reported on the website of the Consulate General of the French Embassy in Russia. It becomes clear why Macron calls Putin every week.

In Russia, there was hysteria over the disqualification of skaters. Russian-titled Russian coach Tatiana Tarasova reacted to the International Skating Union's (ISU) decision to remove Russian figure skaters from competition because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine: ""You should have a conscience. The life of an athlete is very short, and they take it away. Bandits!"" Disrespectful Tarasova, your compatriots, real thugs of the Russian army, are taking the lives of Ukrainians, not figuratively, but literally. But you are unlikely to realize this, so the sanctions will continue to work.

The thief country doesn't return leased aircraft to Europe. AerCap, the world's largest aircraft leasing company, is demanding from insurers about $3.5 billion in compensation for aircraft stuck in Russia, Bloomberg reports. It is noted that the Irish company managed to return only 22 of the 135 aircraft and 3 of the 14 engines installed on Russian aircraft before the ""special operation.""

What about Belarus?

The occupiers are using the airport in Brest, Belarus, to shell Ukraine. The issue of the invasion of Belarusian troops into our country ""went away."" ""The offensive from Belarus is already underway, but not the Belarusian army. Moreover, the Russians have begun to use the Brest airport, from which the shelling of our territories starts,"" said the adviser to the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine Vadym Denisenko.

The second train in three days in Belarus derailed. It was equipped with Russian military equipment. 8 activists were detained.

Russian lies

The Center for Strategic Communications explored the main narratives in Russia's Telegram channels on March 28-29. Russian fascist propagandists talk about ""neo-Nazis,"" the sale of orphans, and discrimination against black people. The occupying country demonizes the Ukrainian army and lies about bullying the Russian military, promotes the topic of ""black transplantology"" and argues that poverty has already begun in Europe because of sanctions against Russia. All these are obvious throwaways and fakes.

The Kremlin's lies are very professional and convincing. According to a Levada Center poll, after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russian support for Putin's actions rose to 83%.

Russian fascist propagandist Simonyan and her fictional flash mob.

The Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security states that Russian propaganda media have begun to disperse new lies about Ukraine. They claim our country allegedly did purposeful work to distort the historical truth and ideological preparation for the military operation against Russia. This conclusion is based on the results of an ""analysis of about 300 Ukrainian textbooks and manuals"" conducted by Russian educators and historians. The aggressor state pretends to be the victim, and the victim is tried to be shown as the aggressor. This is how politics is done in Putin's Russia.

Sanctions on the aggressor!

Australia imposes additional duties of 35% on all goods imported from Russia and Belarus.

Japan has included gold bars in the list of luxury items; now they're prohibited to export to Russia. This is the strengthening of sanctions in response to Russian aggression in Ukraine. In addition to ingots, it is also forbidden to export gold coins and banknotes.

– TV presenter Sergei Brilov;

– General Director of Gazprom-Media Aleksandr Zharov;

– Russia Today media group (works under the Sputnik brand);

– RT channel.

Russians planned to destroy the air defense capabilities of Ukraine in one go and reported to their command that 90% of Ukrainian airfields and anti-aircraft missile systems. But actually, the Armed Forces of Ukraine were prepared for that so they managed to shelter almost all of the vehicles and people from the enemy fire.

Russians have not and do not control the airspace, only those over the temporarily occupied territories, where their air defense systems ""S-300"", ""S-400"", ""Buk"", ""Pantsir"", ""Tor"" were deployed. Furthermore, even over those areas, the occupiers keep losing aircraft: 143 planes and 131 helicopters in total were downed already. Russian aircraft tries to keep themselves away from the Ukrainian air defense systems and fighters.

Russians have changed their tactics two times already: firstly, instead of fighting the Ukrainian military, they started to bomb civilians; then they concentrated their efforts in a limited number of directions in Eastern Ukraine.
