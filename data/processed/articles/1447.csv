0,275ae355-e655-49e9-a125-8789dedd3346,['Kevin Liptak'],2022-03-18 00:00:00,"(CNN) President Joe Biden sought to use a 110-minute video call on Friday to dissuade his Chinese counterpart from assisting Russia in its war on Ukraine, a pivotal moment that could determine the trajectory of the bloody conflict.

President Xi Jinping told Biden that both the US and China have a responsibility for ensuring peace, according to state media, an oblique suggestion he is uninterested in escalating the conflict. Afterward, however, the White House said its concerns over Beijing's possible intervention haven't been assuaged.

""We have that concern,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. ""The President detailed what the implications and consequences would be if China provides material support to Russia as it conducts brutal attacks against Ukrainian cities and civilians. And that is something we'll be watching and the world will be watching.""

Senior administration officials described the call as ""direct,"" ""substantive"" and ""detailed,"" but would not offer many details about the lengthy conversation. The bulk of the leaders' discussion centered on the war in Ukraine and the implications the crisis would have for US-China relations and the ""international order,"" an official said. But the administration refused to publicly detail what those consequences would be.

Biden's goal in speaking with Xi directly was partly to ascertain where exactly the Chinese President stood, and it remained unclear afterward whether he'd gained much clarity. He did not make any specific requests of Xi, the White House said, choosing instead to offer a broader view of the international situation.

1,275ae355-e655-49e9-a125-8789dedd3346,"['Abc News', 'March']",,"In a high-stakes video call, President Joe Biden and China's President Xi Jinping spoke Friday morning for an hour and 50 minutes for the first time since November amid concerns that China will help Russian President Vladimir Putin's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

Nearly four hours after the call ended, and hours after China put out its own version of events, the White House released a readout of the meeting. While lacking concrete details, the 164-word U.S. account stressed that Biden made clear the ""implications and consequences"" if China aligns with Russia and provides it ""material support"" for its attacks.

""President Biden detailed our efforts to prevent and then respond to the invasion, including by imposing costs on Russia. He described the implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia as it conducts brutal attacks against Ukrainian cities and civilians,"" the White House said.

A readout from China, released ahead of the White House's, described the call as ""constructive"" -- a word the Biden administration did not use.

A senior administration official described the video meeting as ""direct,"" ""substantive,"" and ""detailed,"" adding that Biden and Xi spend the ""preponderance of their time"" on Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

After that official said Biden ""really wasn't making specific requests of China"" on the call and that he was, instead, ""laying out his assessment of the situation, what he thinks makes sense, and the implications of certain actions,"" ABC News Senior White House Correspondent asked White House press secretary Jen Psaki, ""Why not, given the stakes here?""

""Because China has to make a decision for themselves about where they want to stand and how they want the history books to look at them and view their actions,"" Psaki replied. ""And that is a decision for President Xi and the Chinese to make.""

Psaki said Biden ""made clear what the implications and the consequences would be if China provides material support to Russia"" -- a line she repeated throughout the briefing, but she would not elaborate on whether the U.S. views military or economic aid as more of a concern or which direction they could be leaning towards if they provide help.

She also wouldn't say if Xi ever referred to Putin's war as an ""invasion,"" saying that the White House doesn't ""speak for other countries"" and the Chinese can ""speak for themselves.""

According to China's readout, Xi told Biden the ""situation in Ukraine has developed to such a point that China does not want to see it. China has always advocated peace and opposed war.""

But China has yet to directly condemn Russia for its actions in Ukraine.

China supports negotiations, Xi said, but deferred to the U.S. and NATO to ""conduct dialogue with Russia to solve the crux of the Ukraine crisis and resolve the security concerns of both Russia and Ukraine"" -- appearing to reaffirm China's view that the NATO expansion is the root cause of the war.

The readout said Xi's used two Chinese idioms to Biden: ""One hand cannot clap,"" meaning the two sides need to come together to make any progress in ending the war, and, he said, ""Only the one who tied the bell to the tiger can untie it,"" implying that the U.S. and NATO will need to ""untie the bell"" themselves, and China will support efforts.

China's president also criticized U.S. sanctions saying that it is the common people who suffer from them and that sanctions have the potential of triggering crises in the global economy, according to the readout

White House press secretary Jen Psaki had said Biden would be candid and that the call provided a chance for him to ""assess where President Xi stands."" The conversation would center on ""managing the competition between our two countries as well as Russia's war against Ukraine and other issues of mutual concern,"" according to the White House.

Biden was expected to warn Xi that if China directly helps Russia in its assault on Ukraine there will be consequences -- but it's still unclear if he laid out specific actions the U.S. will take if China were to supply Russia with military equipment or economic assistance to offset the impact of global sanctions.

In what appeared to be a warning shot to the West, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Friday that any foreign supplies to Ukraine containing military equipment will be considered ""legitimate targets"" for Russian strikes after Biden announced this week a slate of weapons the U.S. is supplying to Ukraine.

""We clearly said that any cargo moving into the Ukrainian territory which we would believe is carrying weapons would be fair game. This is clear because we are implementing the operation the goal of which is to remove any threat to the Russian Federation coming from the Ukrainian soil,"" Lavrov said in an English-language interview with the RT television channel.

Ukrainians woke up Friday to the first strike on the outskirts city of Lviv, considered a safe haven until now, and not far from the Polish border. It follows a stark warning from the Pentagon that Russia was broadening its target and escalating attacks this week.

While the Biden administration has hesitated from drawing red lines of what would change its position on not supporting a no-fly zone or troops on the ground in Ukraine, Lavrov's message raises concerns that Russia could fire at military bases in neighboring NATO ally Poland to Ukraine, triggering an Article 5 response.

Earlier this week, national security adviser Jake Sullivan had a seven-hour meeting with his Chinese counterpart in Rome, which was described as ""intense."" A senior Biden administration declined to tell reporters whether China had expressed an openness to providing Russia with military or economic support or if it had already provided support to Russia since it invaded Ukraine.

""We do have deep concerns about China's alignment with Russia at this time, and the national security adviser was direct about those concerns and the potential implications and consequences of certain actions,"" the official said.

That meeting had been ""long-planned"" and ""long-discussed"" as a way to maintain communication with China, but it happened to take place at ""a really timely and important moment in this crisis,"" the official added.

Biden and Xi's critical call comes on the heels of Biden labeling Putin a ""war criminal,"" a ""murderous dictator,"" and a ""pure thug"" in the last 48 hours. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday he ""personally"" agrees with Biden that Russia has committed war crimes in Ukraine.

Washington/Beijing, March 19

US President Joe Biden warned his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping that there would be ""implications and consequences"" for Beijing if it chose to provide direct ""material support"" to Russia amid its invasion of Ukraine and increasing attacks on civilians, the White House has said.

The 110-minute secure video call on Friday was the first conversation between the two leaders since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The talks between Biden and Xi largely focused on Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the implications for the US-China relationship and international order, a senior White House official told reporters.

""He (President Biden) described the implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia as it conducts brutal attacks against Ukrainian cities and civilians,"" the White House said in a readout of the lengthy conversation between the two presidents.

Later, a senior Biden administration official refused to publicly detail what those consequences might be for Beijing, a close ally of Moscow.

""I'm not going to, sort of, publicly lay out our options from here,"" the senior official said.

Ever since Russia launched a 'special military operation' in Ukraine on February 24, China has been treading a fine line, declining to condemn it as an invasion.

The call between the two presidents was about making sure there is a ""direct, candid and detailed and very substantive conversation at the leader level,"" the senior administration official said.

""President Biden detailed our efforts to prevent and then respond to the invasion, including by imposing costs on Russia,"" the White House readout of the meeting said.

Biden underscored his support for a diplomatic resolution to the crisis. The two leaders also agreed on the importance of maintaining open lines of communication, to manage the competition between our two countries, it said.

Biden and Xi also tasked their teams to follow up on their conversation in the critical period ahead, the White House said.

At the same time, President Xi underscored that there have been and will continue to be differences between China and the US. What matters is to keep such differences under control. A steadily growing relationship is in the interest of both sides, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement in Beijing.

On the situation in Ukraine, President Biden expounded on the US position, and expressed readiness for communication with China to prevent the situation from exacerbating, it said.

""China does not want to see the situation in Ukraine to come to this. China stands for peace and opposes war. This is embedded in China's history and culture,"" the statement quoted Xi as telling Biden.

""China makes a conclusion independently based on the merits of each matter. China advocates upholding international law and universally recognised norms governing international relations,"" Xi said.

Taipei (AFP) – Chinese and US warships sailed through the flashpoint Taiwan Strait on Friday, Taiwanese and US officials said, shortly before China's Xi Jinping issued a warning to Joe Biden that ties could suffer if there is a ""mishandling"" of the island's status.

The two warships sailed through the strait -- which separates China from Taiwan -- hours before a highly anticipated nearly two-hour call between the two presidents over the Ukraine crisis and other topics.

During the call, Xi told Biden that their bilateral relationship had met ""more and more challenges"" since the Democrat took office in part because of ""erroneous"" US signals on Taiwan independence, state news agency Xinhua said.

""Mishandling of the Taiwan question will have a disruptive impact on bilateral ties. China hopes that the US will give due attention to this issue,"" the Chinese foreign ministry said in its English-language readout of the meeting.

Earlier this month, former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said Washington should recognise self-ruled Taiwan as a ""free and sovereign country"" during a visit to the island.

Washington has remained Taipei's most important ally and leading arms supplier despite switching diplomatic recognition to Beijing in 1979.

Warship manoeuvres

The Taiwan Strait is a flashpoint for the world's navies.

China regards Taiwan as its territory and has vowed repeatedly to seize it one day, by force if necessary. Washington says the strait is an international waterway.

In a short statement sent to AFP via text message, Taiwan's defence ministry confirmed the passage of China's Shandong aircraft carrier on Friday.

""(We) emphasise that we are aware and monitoring all Chinese PLA aircrafts and ships operating in surrounding areas of Taiwan Strait,"" the statement read.

The US Department of Defense later told AFP by email that ""one of our destroyers"" sailed through the Taiwan Strait on Friday.

Such movements of warships in the 180-kilometre-wide (110-mile-wide) strait are not uncommon.

The last time the Shandong sailed through it was December 2020 -- a day after a US warship had made the same passage.

In December 2019, weeks before Taiwanese voters went to the polls, the Shandong also made a sail-by.

China-Taiwan relations have been especially frosty since President Tsai Ing-wen -- who rejects Beijing's view that the island is part of ""One China"" -- first took office in 2016.

China has massively ramped up its sabre-rattling in recent years, sending 969 Chinese warplanes into Taiwan's air defence zone in 2021, according to a database compiled by AFP -- more than double the roughly 380 in 2020.

Under Biden's administration, Washington has stood by Taipei -- so far approving at least two arms deals to the island to support its air and missile defence systems -- a massive point of contention for Beijing, which says such support ""seriously undermines"" US-China relations.

BEIJING — While Chinese state media have tacked away from primarily pro-Russian coverage of the war in Ukraine, one of the consistent messages remains: Blame the U.S. Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden are scheduled to speak Friday evening Beijing time about bilateral relations and ""issues of common concern,"" Chinese state media announced late Thursday. The call would mark the first official contact between the U.S. and Chinese presidents since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February. Much of Chinese state media coverage since has focused on negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, without describing the conflict as an invasion or war. China's foreign ministry has refused to call Russia's attack on Ukraine an invasion, while blaming the U.S. for ""fueling"" the tensions. That criticism has persisted. People's Daily, the Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper, put a headline about the upcoming Xi-Biden call in a prominent, bolded spot on the right side of its website's front page on Friday. Several lines below it was a piece from the editorial board: ""Sticking to 'double standards' will only bankrupt U.S. credibility,"" the headline said, according to a CNBC translation of the Chinese text.

In a nightly news show Thursday, China's state television broadcaster noted the U.S. plans to send $800 million in military aid to Ukraine, and included clips of Putin blaming Western nations for global inflation. The show closed by citing unnamed analysts warning that the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates in a period of high inflation and uncertainty only adds to the risk of global debt default. As is the case with most Chinese state media, the half-hour news broadcast focused mostly on domestic affairs, including China's own ability to control the recent Covid-19 outbreak. State media announcements on the Xi-Biden call did not specifically mention Ukraine, while the White House announcement included it as a planned topic of discussion. Readouts of contact between high-level U.S. and Chinese officials have tended to separate U.S.-China relations from the two countries' discussion of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi emphasized last week how China's relationship with Russia was as solid as when Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin met and issued a joint statement in early February.

More discussion of humanitarian crisis

Beijing has tried to portray itself as maintaining a relationship with Russia while working with European countries and other nations to broker peace, especially in the face of increased sanctions on Russia by the U.S., EU and other countries. ""Beijing's support for Moscow is mostly rhetorical,"" consulting firm Teneo said in a report released March 10. On Friday, Gabriel Wildau, senior vice president at Teneo, noted a change in that rhetoric. ""In the last few days there are signs of a shift in state media coverage, which may reflect Beijing's attempt to distance itself from Moscow."" He pointed to how China's English-language state television broadcaster has highlighted civilian casualties from Russian attacks, and the Chinese-language one has reported the Ukrainian military's battlefield successes. That reflects further detail than Chinese official media have offered in the past on the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. As of Wednesday, at least 780 civilians have been killed — including 58 children — since Russia's attack began on Feb. 24, according to United Nations data. Last week Beijing announced a ""six-point initiative"" for preventing a large-scale humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, and Premier Li Keqiang said China is ""deeply concerned"" about the situation in Ukraine. Chinese media's slight shift away from primarily Moscow messaging has also targeted a U.S. audience. In an op-ed published in the Washington Post on Wednesday in English, Qin Gang, China's ambassador to the U.S. said ""assertions that China knew about, acquiesced to or tacitly supported this war are purely disinformation.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/18/heres-what-chinese-state-media-is-saying-ahead-of-xis-call-with-biden.html

China adheres to the UN Charter and promotes the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. These are the major principles that underpin China’s approach to the Ukraine crisis, Xi explained.

“All sides need to jointly support Russia and Ukraine in having dialogue and negotiation that will produce results and lead to peace. The US and NATO should also have dialogue with Russia to address the crux of the Ukraine crisis and ease the security concerns of both Russia and Ukraine,” Xi said.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the vast majority of the nearly two hours was spent with the president outlining the views of the United States, its allies and partners on this crisis, including a detailed overview of efforts to prevent and then respond to the invasion, “how we got here, steps we’ve taken, where we’ve gone and why”.

A senior administration official told reporters that the conversation was direct.

“It was substantive and it was detailed. The two leaders spent the preponderance of their time discussing Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine, as well as the implications of the crisis for U.S.-China relations and the international order,” the official said.

“Biden shared with Xi a detailed review of how things have developed to this point, his assessment of the situation today, and President Biden underscored his support for a diplomatic resolution to the crisis,” the official said, adding that Biden described the US’ assessment of Putin’s actions and his miscalculations.

“He also described the unity of the United States and its allies and partners, the unprecedented coordination with our European, NATO, and Indo-Pacific partners, and the overwhelming global unity and condemnation of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as well as the support for Ukraine,” said the official.

“Biden made clear the implication and consequences of China providing material support — if China were to provide material support — to Russia as it prosecutes its brutal war in Ukraine, not just for China’s relationship with the United States but for the wider world,” the official said.

During the call, Biden stressed concerns that Russia is spreading disinformation about biological weapons in Ukraine as a pretext for a false-flag operation and underscored concerns about echoing such disinformation.

US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan had sent a similar message on Monday during a meeting with top Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi in Rome, a senior administration official told reporters.

The official declined comment on whether the US has information that China is providing or is open to providing Moscow with financial and military assistance but did say Sullivan spoke directly about concerns and the “potential implications and consequences of certain actions.” Meanwhile, Biden and Xi also discussed the Taiwan issue during their talks.

“President Xi raised Taiwan. President Biden reiterated that the United States remains committed to our one-China policy and is guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the Three Joint Communiques, and the Six Assurances. And he underscored the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,” the official said.

Senior White House officials gave this information.

According to officials, the 110-minute-long video call between Biden and Jinping was the first between the two leaders since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. He said the talks were mainly focused on Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine and its implications for the international order, in addition to US-China relations.

‘Biden informed of sanctions’

“President Biden described measures aimed at preventing and responding to attacks, including sanctions on Russia,” the officials said. He also explained what the implications and consequences could be if China helped Russia attacking Ukraine.

However, a senior Biden administration official later declined to say publicly what the consequences could be for Beijing, a close ally of Moscow. “I’m not going to publicly share our options here,” he said.

China has been avoiding condemnation of Russia

China has refrained from condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said much of the conversation was spent outlining the views of the US, its allies and partners on the Ukraine crisis, and Biden told Jinping “how did we get here, what steps did we take”. Why did we go to this extent?

A senior Biden administration official said that the conversation was very clear and during this time Biden apprised Jinping of the US assessment of Putin’s actions. He said that Biden told the Chinese President in detail how the situation reached this stage and what his assessment was about the current situation. He said that in the conversation, the US President also expressed his support for a diplomatic solution to the crisis.

According to the official, Biden also referred to the unprecedented coordination between the US and its European, NATO and Indo-Pacific partners regarding Ukraine and global condemnation of the Russian aggression. He said that the US President expressed concern that Russia was spreading propaganda about fears of the use of biological weapons in Ukraine, which should not be ignored.

The official said that while Jinping raised the issue of Taiwan during the talks, Biden made it clear that the US stood by its one-China policy and was following the Taiwan Relations Act, three joint official notices and six assurances. According to the official, Biden also stressed the importance of maintaining peace and stability in the Gulf of Taiwan.

Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement

At the same time, the Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying that in the talks, Jinping made it clear that there have been differences between the US and China and always will be, but keeping these differences under control is very important.

The statement quoted Jinping as saying, “China does not want to see the situation in Ukraine coming to this verge. China is a supporter of peace and opposes war. This sentiment is embedded in the history and culture of China.”

“All sides should jointly support Russia and Ukraine in reaching dialogue and reconciliation, which will ensure peace in the region,” Jinping said.
