The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

1,3adbf90a-e219-40ee-a5fe-b3219bbef756,[],,"War in Ukraine claims lives of at least 1,232 civilians, 1,935 reported as injured – UN

Losses among civilians from February 24, when Russia started the war against Ukraine, until 24:00 on March 30, 2022, amounted to 3,167 civilians (3,090 in the report a day earlier), including 1,232 dead (1,189), the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) reported on Thursday.

""OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration, "" the document reads.

This concerns, for example, Mariupol and Volnovakha (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), Popasna (Luhansk region), and Irpin (Kyiv region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics.

""Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes, "" the report says.

According to the United Nations, a total of 1,232 killed (250 men, 176 women, 18 girls, and 36 boys, as well as 58 children and 694 adults whose sex is yet unknown).

A total of 1,935 have been injured (225 men, 167 women, 36 girls, and 32 boys, as well as 81 children and 1,394 adults whose sex is yet unknown).

Compared to the previous day, four children were killed and seven more were injured, according to the UN.

OHCHR says that in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, as of midnight on March 31, there were 338 (328) dead and 743 (727) injured in government-controlled territory, and 66 (65) dead and 245 (243) injured in territory controlled by self-proclaimed ""republics"".

In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 1,775 casualties (828 killed and 947 injured)

The report also states that, according to the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine, as of 08:00 on March 30, 148 (145) children were killed and 232 (222) injured.

An increase in figures in this update compared with the previous update (as of 24:00 midnight on 29 March 2022 (local time) should not be attributed to civilian casualties that occurred on 30 March only, as during the day OHCHR also corroborated casualties that occurred on previous days, the document reads.",https://interfax.com.ua/news/general/819917.html

A senior official at the Pentagon said the troops were being repositioned into Belarus whose border lies 10 miles away.

He said: ""We think that they are leaving, I can't tell you that they're all gone.""

Around Kyiv, the Kremlin had begun to withdraw approximately 20 per cent of its forces to the north of Ukraine where they could be resupplied and rearmed, the US official added.

Declassified intelligence from the White House has revealed Vladimir Putin feels ""misled by the Russian military” and has lost faith in his top officials.

The newly revealed report says the Russian president did not even know his military was using conscripts for the invasion which has killed an estimated 7,000 Russian troops.

“Certainly, this is not something that can be perceived as creating comfortable conditions for the continuation of the talks,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, five weeks into the war that has left thousands dead and driven more than 4 million refugees from Ukraine.

It was not immediately possible to verify the Russian accusation. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said he could “neither confirm nor reject the claim that Ukraine was involved in this, simply because I do not possess all the military information.”

Russia has reported cross-border shelling from Ukraine before, including an incident last week that killed a military chaplain, but not an incursion of its airspace. The depot, run by Russian energy giant Rosneft, is about 21 miles from the Ukraine border.

Russian Troops Retreat From Kyiv

Meanwhile, Russian troops appeared to be in rapid retreat from areas around Kyiv, three days after Moscow said it planned to reduce military activity around the Ukrainian capital and the northern city of Chernihiv to create more trust between the two sides and promote negotiations.

But Ukraine and its allies have warned that the Kremlin is not de-escalating but regrouping, resupplying its troops, and redeploying them to the country’s east for an intensified assault on the predominantly Russian-speaking Donbas region, which includes Mariupol.

The latest negotiations, taking place by video, follow a meeting Tuesday in Turkey, where Ukraine reiterated its willingness to abandon a bid to join NATO and declare itself neutral. In return, it proposed that its security be guaranteed by several other countries.

The head of the Russian delegation, Vladimir Medinsky, wrote on social media that Moscow’s positions on retaining control of the Crimean Peninsula — seized from Ukraine in 2014 — and expanding the territory in eastern Ukraine held by Russia-backed separatists “are unchanged.”

Red Cross Struggles to Deliver Humanitarian Aid

The International Committee for the Red Cross struggled to work out an operation to send emergency aid into Mariupol and bring civilians out by bus.

The strategic southern port city on the Sea of Azov has seen some of the worst suffering of the war, with weeks of heavy fighting and shortages of water, food and medicine. Around 100,000 people are believed to be in the city, down from a pre-war 430,000.

“We are running out of adjectives to describe the horrors that residents in Mariupol have suffered,” Red Cross spokesperson Ewan Watson said. “The situation is horrendous and deteriorating, and it’s now a humanitarian imperative that people be allowed to leave and aid supplies be allowed in.”

City authorities said the Russians were blocking access to Mariupol and it was too dangerous for people to leave on their own. Those who have fled have mostly done so via private cars, but drivable vehicles and fuel are in short supply.

“We do not see a real desire on the part of the Russians and their satellites to provide an opportunity for Mariupol residents to evacuate to territory controlled by Ukraine,” Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the mayor of Mariupol, wrote on the Telegram messaging app.

He said Russian forces “are categorically not allowing any humanitarian cargo, even in small amounts, into the city.”",https://gvwire.com/2022/04/01/ukraine-forces-strike-oil-depot-in-russia-ahead-of-peace-talks-report/

The exodus of Ukrainian civilians continues and the US is preparing to accept 100,000 refugees fleeing the horror caused by the Kremlin troops.

About 2,000 civilians ride evacuation buses heading from the coastal city of Berdyansk to Zaporizhzhia, which is controlled by the Ukrainian government, transporting evacuees from the besieged city of Mariupol.

Ukraine denounced that another 45,000 people were forcibly deported to Russia and also to the separatist territory of Donetsk — a self-proclaimed republic and recognized by the Kremlin.

In addition to the $1.6 billion already committed by Washington, the aid includes laser-guided rocket systems, drones, ammunition, night vision devices, tactical secure communications systems, medical supplies and spare parts.

“This decision underscores America's unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity in support of its heroic efforts to repel Russia's war,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said in a statement.

02:56: The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, criticized Europe for “reacting silently” to the humanitarian catastrophe in the city of Mariupol, in the south of the country, caused by the Russian bombings and siege.

It is estimated that some 160,000 citizens have been living without basic services for more than a month in Mariupol, a port on the Sea of Azov that has become the main target of Russian troops in Ukraine due to its strategic position between the Crimean peninsula and the Dombas.

He stated that Russian citizens “are not told the truth” in the context of the announcement by Russia to resume the mobilization of young people for military service mandatory spring.

“This year's recruits can be sent to war against our State, against our people. It's a guaranteed death for many very young boys. And even though they are not our citizens, it is still our duty as a people to warn them,” he said.

02:15: More than 6,000 people have been evacuated this Friday through humanitarian corridors on a difficult day in which the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) confirmed that they have not been able to access the city of Mariupol, where they were going to help escort a convoy with twelve buses and civilian vehicles.

Specifically, the Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine, Irina Vereshchuk, has cited more than 1,400 civilians who have left Berdyansk and Melitopol — 771 people from the latter city — on her own transport to Zaporizhzhia.

01:47: The Ukrainian authorities have warned that Russia could use chemical weapons in the country, “as they already did in the Syrian war”, and have said that they “must be prepared”, so medical institutions are receiving training to be able to deal with this possible scenario.

“Despite the ban on the use of chemical weapons by all international institutions, they used them in Syria (the Russians). We have a clear awareness that they can do so in our country. We must be prepared for this,” said the secretary of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, Oleksei Danilov.

01:26: Several buses with inhabitants of the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, besieged and bombed by Russian troops, arrived on Friday night in Zaporizhzhia, a Ukrainian city controlled by the Kiev army, according to journalists from the AFP agency on the spot.

“The US Government is providing the Government of Ukraine with life-saving equipment and supplies that could be deployed should Russia use chemical and biological weapons against Ukraine,” Psaki said at the White House daily news conference.

00:24: The US Army has canceled a test of its Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile which initially only intended to delay in an attempt to lower nuclear tensions with Russia during the Ukrainian war, as reported Friday by the Air Force to Reuters.

The Pentagon first announced the delay of the test on March 2 after Russia said it was putting its nuclear forces on high alert. Washington then said it was important that both the United States and Russia “take into account the risk of miscalculation and take steps to reduce those risks.”

00:14: The President of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, met this Friday with Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelensky, and delivered a speech to the Ukrainian Parliament in which she acknowledged that the European institution will “help” Kiev to join the European Union.

23:36: A senior official of the US Treasury Department said on Friday that Russia is economically “cornered” by Western sanctions and that the current strong rally of the ruble has little significance.

“Russia is cornered and on its way to becoming a closed economy, but it is one of the least equipped countries in the world to function as a closed economy” because it depends too much on its commodity exports, explained this senior official, who wanted to keep his name.

Russia, he said, is suffering “serious” consequences from Western sanctions following the invasion of Ukraine: “high inflation that will only increase further, and a deep recession that will only worsen.”

23:25: The ballet of the Bolshoi theater in Moscow will present on Saturday a “heroic” choreography in support of the Russian military operation in Ukraine, announced this Friday the famous dance company.

“The ballet 'Spartacus', by Aram Jachaturian, will be performed on April 2, 2022 on the historical stage of Bolshoi,” the theater said in a statement.

“The proceeds of this legendary show, choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich, will be donated to the families of soldiers killed during the Russian military operation in Ukraine,” he added.

23:16: China carried out a major cyber attack against Ukrainian military and nuclear installations in the days prior to the invasion of Russia, according to Ukrainian intelligence reports.

22:49: The Armed Forces of Ukraine have accused Russia this Friday of having mined civilian buildings and infrastructure, as well as other spaces of the city of Bucha, in the Kiev region, before being expelled by Ukrainian troops.

22:19: Ukraine gave part this Friday of the liberation of 86 of its military men captured by Russia, in an exchange for Russian military whose number was not specified.

22:12: The Ukrainian authorities have warned that, despite the withdrawal of Russian troops from Kiev and Chernigov, Moscow plans a new offensive through which to conquer Ukraine before May 9, Victory Day in Russia.

Russia, along with Belarus and other former Soviet republics, commemorates on this day the surrender of Nazi Germany in World War II in 1945. From then until the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Red Square in Moscow was the scene of a large military parade, which, later, in 1995, was resumed.

21:58: European governments and companies worked on Friday on a common approach to Russia's demand that they pay for their gas in rubles, while mitigating the threat of an imminent supply interruption.

21:34: Russia has ordered its universities to move all its content from Youtube to the Russian social platform VK Video and RuTube, the Russian video platform.

The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, said he “could not confirm” these reports. The United Nations agency “will seek additional information to provide an independent assessment of the situation,” a statement said.

“The level of radiation around the plant is currently normal,” Grossi said to the press in Vienna.

However, the withdrawal of Russian troops could have led to a “localized” increase in radiation due to the movement of vehicles, he said. The same happened when the Russian army took the place on the first day of the offensive on February 24.

19:55: Amazon enabled in Poland a humanitarian aid center that has 4,500 square meters of storage space, to cover the needs of Ukrainian refugees fleeing the war.

More than 4 million Ukrainians have been forced to leave their country after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the need to help them is growing every day, as the e-commerce company points out.

Therefore, a week after the opening of Amazon's first humanitarian aid center in Slovakia, they set up a second center in Poland near Sosnowiec, a city in southern Poland, with which it has doubled the space allocated to provide critical supplies to those affected.

Three NGO vehicles were scheduled to leave Mariupol this Friday to escort a convoy with twelve buses and private vehicles with residents on board.

However, the ICRC, whose team consists of nine people, has detailed in a statement that the staff had to return to Zaporiyia, after “conditions” on the ground have made the task “impossible”.

19:30: The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, this Friday asked his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, to intercede with Moscow to achieve a ceasefire in Mariupol “long enough” to achieve an evacuation of the city and relevant humanitarian operations.

19:23: Russia assured this Friday to have new evidence, which it will transfer to the UN, of the existence of alleged biological weapons programs developed in Ukraine with the support of the United States, an accusation that so far has not been confirmed by independent sources.

19:11: The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Denis Shmigal, accused Russia of wanting to provoke “a food crisis” at the global level, after provoking another energy and within the framework of the invasion of his neighboring country.
