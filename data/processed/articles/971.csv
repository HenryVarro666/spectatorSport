“It is day 27 of the heroic resistance of the Ukrainian people to russia's military invasion. Failing to succeed, the enemy continues to launch missiles and bomb strikes from the air, at military and civilian infrastructure of Zhytomyr, Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, and Donetsk regions. The enemy has carried out over 80 flights, including 29 from the airfields of Baranovychi and Bobruisk, which are located on the territory of Belarus,” the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine posted on Facebook.

As noted, the strikes were carried out using bomber aircraft, attack bombers, and fighter jets. Five reconnaissance aircraft were used in order to carry out area reconnaissance of Ukraine's territory from the air.

In certain areas of the Black Sea, in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov operational zones, ships of the russian federation's navy are carrying out tasks. In the northeastern part of the Sea of Azov, with the purpose of supporting the actions of the ground forces of the occupational forces, up to 5 ships of varying types continue to be stationed.

Despite the active propaganda, the personnel of various units of the Central Military District are demoralized due to significant losses.

There are cases of mass refusal of servicemen of the armed forces of the russian federation to take part in the war against Ukraine. According to the available information, in the 155th separate brigade of the marines, since the beginning of war, approximately 220 servicemen have refused to take part in the armed aggression against Ukraine. In total, since February 24, approximately 50 servicemen of this unit have been killed and 110 more have been wounded. Additionally, the death of top and senior officers in the russian-Ukrainian war has significantly resonated throughout the russian society.

“The enemy, as noted earlier, has been having significant problems with the logistics within the occupying forces in almost all directions. In addition, the occupying forces continue to suffer significant losses due to an inadequately organised medical supply system. Thus, due to the untimely provision of medical care, a lack of system of medical evacuation of the wounded, and a lack of medication, units of the 7th assault division of the airborne forces of the russian federation have suffered heavy losses,” reads the report.

As reported, from February 24 to March 22, the Russian lost about 15,300 personnel, 509 tanks, 1,556 armored personnel carriers, 252 artillery systems, 80 MLRS, 45 anti-aircraft warfare systems, 99 aircraft, 123 helicopters, 1,000 vehicles, 3 ships/boats, 70 fuel tanks, 35 UAVs of operational and tactical level, 15 special equipment units. Data are being updated. The calculation is complicated by the high intensity of hostilities.

Russian president Putin declared war on Ukraine on February 24 and launched a large-scale invasion. Russian troops shell and destroy infrastructure, conduct massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and towns using artillery, MLRS, and ballistic missiles. Ukraine courageously resists the aggressor.
