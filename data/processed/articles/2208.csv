In the video, dozens of military vehicles are seen alongside a railroad near one of the only two Dnieper River crossings. The convoy moves toward the bridge and then appears to double back and head west.

In the video, an airstrike can also be seen in the distance.

The two bridges at Nova Kakhovka — a railroad bridge and a vehicle bridge — are vital for the Russians, who have reportedly been trying to advance their frontline in the area and cross from the south bank,to the north bank of the Dnieper River.

There are only two other Dnieper River crossings for over 100 miles: a bridge a Kherson — which a CNN team in the city says has been the site of intense clashes between Russian and Ukrainian forces — and a railroad bridge just east of Kherson at Prydniprovs'ke.

The webcam had been broadcasting the location of the Russian convoy for hours, showing the dozens and dozens of military vehicles moving around the bridges. But at 11:11 a.m. local time, the camera suddenly was forced downward so it could only view the ground directly beneath it.

In frame, as the camera looks at the ground, are a number of Russian soldiers.

Ukraine is being hit by a second wave of missile strikes from Russia following a heavy bombing campaign this morning.

An adviser to the president confirmed the fresh round of attacks after explosions were heard in a number of cities.

Footage shows a military warehouse near Odessa being obliterated while another video appears to show a number of Russian helicopters attempting to seize Antonov Aiport.

The strikes come after Ukraine’s border force confirmed a checkpoint between the Kyiv region and Belarus had been overrun by Russian forces.

Troops and tanks have entered the Vilcha crossing, which lies less than a 100 miles north of the capital on a road which runs directly to the city.

It’s the first sign of a significant ground invasion making a breakthrough in the west of the country.

The checkpoint is around a two-and-a-half drive from Kyiv, which has sustained rocket strikes since this morning.

Russian troops have been pictured crossing into several parts of eastern Ukraine, either by taking on soldiers on the border or by making their way up from the Crimean peninsula.

Western intelligence agencies have long feared Vladimir Putin would look to surround the capital in an effort to crack the pro-European regime currently in power.

Ukraine’s border force said it was continuing to hold out and push Russian forces back at other points, claiming to have killed 50 soldiers in one town and shot down seven fighter jets.

But unverified footage on social media showed a Russian flag being hoisted over the city of Novaya Kahovka in Kherson, where Ukraine’s military earlier admitted they were struggling to resist.

Ukrainian police have asked citizens to be on the look out for Russian agents operating inside the country, saying ‘special attention should be paid to people with elements of red color on their clothes’.

An image of two captured Russian soldiers released by the Ukrainian military showed they were wearing an identifying marker on their leg.

Another pictured showed Russian prisoners of war lying on the ground, all of whom had a white ribon tied around their leg, similar to another soldier in an unverified image north of Crimea.

Hundreds of civilians are already feared dead after Putin finally gave the order to invade this morning.

Ukrainians started fleeing some cities as the Russian military claimed to have incapacitated all of Ukraine’s air defences and air bases within hours.

Troops are flooding into eastern cities like Kharkiv and Mariupol, witnesses have said.

Air raid sirens have sounded across the country – including in Lviv, where most diplomatic missions have moved to – and communication systems have been hit by cyberattacks.

Ukraine’s border guards said it was under attack ‘with the use of artillery, heavy equipment and firearms’ in the regions of Luhansk, Sumy, Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Zhytomyr.

It said Belarus’ armed forces – a Russian ally which lies to Ukraine’s north close to Kyiv – had joined in with the military assault, with at least one border point destroyed.

Videos posted on social media showed smoke rising above several Ukrainian cities and there are unconfirmed reports Russian paratroopers have moved to take control of Kyiv.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has vowed to ‘fight for our country’ but urged global leaders to help by providing more defence assistance.

The military has long been preparing for an assault from Russia with the help of Western allies, but there is a gulf in capability between the two nations.

Zelensky has called for people with military experience to ‘join the defence of Ukraine’ and asked for blood donations to help wounded soldiers.

He said: ‘Everyone who has military experience who can join the defence of Ukraine has to come to the military offices of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

‘Please keep yourself updated on the information. We have wounded soldiers in hospitals that require blood donations, please join and donate your blood.

‘We carry out serious work on the defence and every enterprise, every business person needs to help. Please look after your workers, your employees.

‘All people should have all the necessary facilities and goods. The bank system of Ukraine has got the resources to protect this state, to protect the interests of Ukrainian nationals.

‘I’m grateful to all the politicians who support Ukraine and defend our sovereignty.’

Many nations have pledged to help Ukraine despite Putin’s chilling warning to the West that anyone who interferes ‘faces consequences greater than ever seen in history’.

Nato agreed to increase land, sea, and air forces on the eastern flank near Ukraine and Russia as it declared ‘peace in Europe has been shattered’.

World leaders fear the invasion could cause massive casualties, topple Ukraine’s democratically elected government and threaten the post-Cold War balance on the continent.

One former British army general even said that UK and Russia could end up at war if Putin ramps up his aggression.

The EU, UK and US are all discussing a package of sanctions with announcements expected later today.

In a mid-day address to the nation, Boris Johnson said the UK and allies will respond to the invasion of Ukraine with ‘massive’ measures that will ‘hobble the Russian economy’.

He said the world cannot allow Ukraine’s freedom to be ‘snuffed out’.

He added: ‘A vast invasion is under way by land, by sea and by air. And this is not, in the infamous phrase, some faraway country of which we know little.

‘We have Ukrainian friends in this country, neighbours, co-workers. Ukraine is a country that for decades has enjoyed freedom and democracy, and the right to choose its own destiny.

‘We and the world cannot allow that freedom just to be snuffed out. We cannot and will not just look away.’

Why is Russia invading Ukraine? Russia has been steadily building a force of up to 200,000 on the border for several months, heavily outnumbering its neighbour’s army. Ukraine’s military has been preparing for an assault with the assistance of Western allies but there is a gulf in capability between the two nations. The conflict between the countries began in 2014 when a popular revolution saw the pro-Moscow government in Kyiv swept away. In response, Russia annexed Crimea and Moscow-backed separatists forces in the eastern Donbas region declared their independence, triggering years of grinding conflict which has claimed thousands of lives. Russian president Vladimir Putin penned a long essay last year setting out his ethno-nationalist belief that Ukraine is destined to be a part of Russia, a clear warning he did not intend to stop at the Crimean peninsula. US and UK intelligence has long warned Russia could use a range of military tactics to attack Ukraine. Putin has kept the world guessing about his true intentions in recent months and at times has appeared to suggest a willingness to engage with diplomatic talks, despite preparing for an incursion. After weeks of rising tensions, he took a series of steps this week that dramatically raised the stakes. First, he recognised the independence of two separatist-held regions in Ukraine – Donetsk and Luhansk. Then he said that recognition extends even to the large parts of the territories held by Ukrainian forces, including the major Azov Sea port of Mariupol. Finally, he asked for and was granted permission to use military force outside Russia – effectively formalising a military deployment to the rebel regions. He suggested there was a way out of the crisis – if Kyiv would recognise Russia’s sovereignty over Crimea and renounced its bid to join Nato. Both demands have been previously rejected by Ukraine and the West.

Russian President Vladimir Putin authorised a military operation in eastern Ukraine on Thursday while the UN Security Council was holding an emergency meeting to dissolve the tensions.

Shortly after Putin spoke in a special televised address on Russian state TV, explosions could be heard in the pre-dawn quiet of the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. Gunfire rattled near the capital's main airport, the Interfax news agency said.

Putin said he had authorised a special military operation in breakaway areas of eastern Ukraine and clashes between Russian and Ukrainian forces were only a matter of time.

Meanwhile, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres has made a direct and strong appeal to Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop his troops from attacking Ukraine and ""give peace a chance"".



Guterres addressed an emergency UN Security Council meeting on Ukraine late Wednesday night, the second meeting this week and the fourth since January 31 as tensions escalated between Russia and Ukraine. Earlier in the day, the UN chief had addressed the UN General Assembly meeting on Ukraine.



I want to reaffirm what I expressed this morning in the meeting in the General Assembly, but of course it would not make any sense to bother you reading again the same text that I am sure you are all aware of, Guterres said in his brief off-the-cuff remarks at the Security Council meeting requested by Ukraine.",https://news.abplive.com/news/world/russian-declares-war-against-ukraine-live-updates-russian-president-vladimir-putin-authorized-troops-carry-special-military-operation-donbass-region-1515173
