2,f768104b-d952-48bc-a913-b73502b5a90f,['The Economist'],,"P OLISH LEADERS have long pushed their partners in NATO and the EU to forge closer ties with Ukraine, warning of the risk of Russian aggression, only to be dismissed as paranoid. Russia’s murderous and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine has proven them entirely right. Polish denunciations of Russia’s imperial ambitions, which Americans and western Europeans once pooh-poohed as post-communist stress disorder, have now become standard NATO talking points. But it is not just Poland’s view of Russia that is being taken more seriously; it is Poland’s role in the world. In a matter of a few weeks, the country has become the linchpin of the Western effort to defend Ukraine and deter Russia, a task as important as it is dangerous.

Hundreds of Stinger missiles, Javelin anti-tank weapons and other munitions have already poured into Ukraine through Poland and Romania, part of America’s $350m package to assist the besieged country. Poland itself has dispatched an ammunition convoy to Ukraine, and plans to send mortars, small drones and man-portable missile systems, known as MANPADS , from its own supplies. Weapons deliveries from other countries, including a €450m ($490m) consignment financed by the EU , are on the way, too. “The biggest share of military equipment, both lethal and non-lethal, will go through Poland,” says Konrad Muzyka of Rochan Consulting, a military-analysis firm. “Like it or not,” says Stanislaw Koziej, a former brigadier-general in Poland’s army, “we are going to be the main link in the chain connecting Ukraine and the West.”

Poland is nearer the eye of the storm than any other NATO member. It risks being drawn in further. For days the country mooted giving its M i G -29 fighter jets to Ukraine in exchange for F -16s from America. The Americans, who initially pushed the plan, balked when Poland asked to send the jets via an American airbase in Germany. On March 9th they backed out, saying transferring the jets risked escalation. Poland wants to do as much as possible, say officials in Warsaw, without being dragged into the war. The crisis has also turned Poland, almost overnight, into the country with the second-largest refugee population in Europe. At least 2m people have escaped Ukraine since the start of the invasion, the most extensive and rapid movement of refugees in Europe’s post-war history. Over 1.3m have reached Poland. The country has coped remarkably well with the influx. But its resources are stretched. Poland was already home to Europe’s largest Ukrainian diaspora, over a million strong, and so is an important recruiting ground for Ukraine’s resistance. In the first ten days of the war, Polish border guards recorded 217,000 crossings into Ukraine. A large share were Ukrainians heading back home to fight. “Our people are waiting,” says Aleksandr, who arrived at the border by bus from Estonia. “They’re going to tell us what to do, give us ammunition and guns, and then we’re off to work.” Poland’s size, location and infrastructure make it the West’s most important gateway to Ukraine. The two countries share a 530km (330-mile) border, punctuated by over a dozen crossings. The airport in Rzeszow, about an hour’s drive from the border, is the closest big airport to Ukraine on NATO territory. Flight radar data show an uptick in military aircraft, almost certainly involved in weapons deliveries, flying in and out of Rzeszow since the start of the war. Were Kyiv to fall to the Russians, which is still far from guaranteed, Ukrainian troops and volunteers would probably regroup in the west of the country, in or around Lviv, only 80km from the Polish border. This would further raise Poland’s importance for Ukraine.

The war has already strengthened Poland’s position in NATO . The alliance is increasing its presence in Poland dramatically. America had deployed nearly 5,000 new troops to Poland in February, even before the Russian invasion, bringing the total to some 9,000. It also recently approved the sale to Poland of 250 Abrams tanks.

Poland also hopes to reconcile with the rest of the EU . The bloc has repeatedly chided Poland’s nationalist government for stacking its top court with cronies, threatening judges who rule against it and harassing the media. The stand-off prompted the EU to freeze €36bn in pandemic recovery funds earmarked for Poland and to fine it for ignoring rulings by the European Court of Justice. Poland has moved to meet some EU demands, and its efforts in the face of Russia’s aggression may earn it a more sympathetic hearing.

But there are incalculable risks involved, too. Analysts say Russian retaliation of one kind or another against Poland is a near certainty. The longer the war lasts, the more desperate Russia will be to destroy the supply lines connecting Poland to Ukraine. “I’m afraid that Russian rocket attacks against those supply lines are something we have to take into account in the coming days and weeks,” says Wojciech Kononczuk of the Centre for Eastern Studies, a think-tank in Warsaw. America clearly takes the possibility seriously: it is sending Patriot missile-defence batteries to Poland. Others mention the threat of Russian sabotage and cyberattacks inside Poland. A social-media monitoring group has already uncovered a Russian disinformation campaign intended to spread panic and drive up resentment towards refugees from Ukraine.

Vladimir Putin’s threats against countries that interfere in Ukraine are not to be taken lightly. But for Poland and NATO , the only risk bigger than that of Russian retaliation is the risk of Western inaction. “There’s no alternative, because we’re in the same boat,” says Mr Kononczuk. “The only difference is that Ukraine’s in the front, and we’re in the back.” ■

The Russian invasion of neighboring Ukraine has reverberated in Poland well beyond the influx of more than 1.4 million refugees, a group of mostly women and children that threatens to overwhelm the country’s infrastructure for providing assistance.

Poland’s historical adversary Russia appears to many here to be on an expansionist path that could end up dragging Warsaw into a broader conflict with potentially catastrophic consequences — threatening the post-Cold War order that has seen the nation prosper and develop into a European success story.

A sense of disquiet is plainly evident, even as life appears to proceed at its normal, if hectic, pace in cities such as Warsaw and Krakow.

“Yes, Polish society is terrified,” said Slawomir Debski, a foreign policy expert in Poland who has advised several governments in Warsaw. “The whole society is aware of how awful, how terrible, and dramatic, any kinetic confrontation with Russia can be.”

The fact that Poland is an established member of both the European Union and the U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization tempers fears that Moscow’s perceived push for a “Greater Russia” could eventually spill into Poland — which was a Soviet satellite state until the fall of Eastern Bloc communism in 1989, the year the Berlin Wall came down.

Poland shares a 144-mile border with Russia — along with centuries of contentious coexistence and profound mutual suspicion. And to some, especially those who lived through the Cold War, the NATO shield seems not all that persuasive.

NATO “is just a name,” said Dorota Karpinska, 61, who runs one of the many street stands offering obwarzanki, chewy, bagel-like breads widely consumed here. “Who knows what they’re doing?”

Poles born in the post-communist era appear less likely to fear that the conflict will envelop their country. There is a clear generational split, even if the Russian attack was a kind of wake-up call for the young as well.

“It’s the old people like my parents who feel that Russia can attack anytime,” said Andrzej Piszczek, 24, a student seated in a cafe thick with cigarette smoke and incense. “They say, ‘You never know. We need to prepare ourselves, we need to buy flour, petrol.’”

The current situation, many note, differs greatly from the days of the Cold War, when it was widely believed that neither Russia nor the West would resort to the use of nuclear weapons capable of obliterating much of the planet. With Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, and his nuclear threats, no such sense of security exists these days.

“Nuclear blackmail is [now] on the agenda almost every day,” said Wlodzimierz Marciniak, a political scientist and former Polish ambassador to the Russian Federation. “Right now the war is hot and it is next door.”

The streets here in the ancient city Krakow have lately seen a new phenomenon: U.S. soldiers, unarmed but in military fatigues, strolling through downtown, window shopping, visiting tourist sites, stopping for a coffee. Longtime residents say the groups of uniformed GIs have emerged from their bases only in recent days, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine and a buildup in U.S. forces based in Poland.

On a recent afternoon, Magda, 39, a restaurant worker, requested a selfie with a group of U.S. soldiers. She said she wanted the photo for her son, 15. The soldiers quickly complied. Their presence, she said, offered both a sense of reassurance — that America has Poland’s back, so to speak — and a feeling that a broader geopolitical conflict could indeed be on the horizon.

“It’s confusing,” Magda, who asked that her surname be withheld for privacy reasons, said after the soldiers had moved on. “I want to live through this, to see the world.”

The Pentagon did not respond immediately to an inquiry about the soldiers’ heightened public profile in Krakow and in the southeastern Polish city of Przemysl, close to the Ukrainian border and a key transit point for war refugees.

As the war next door rages, some Poles are taking precautionary measures.

The Polish press has reported a run on demands for passports from those who want to be able to leave the country expeditiously if necessary.

Authorities have also seen rising numbers of new recruits for the Territorial Defense Forces, a kind of reserve arm of the military. Demand for slots has increased sevenfold since the Russian invasion, a military spokesman told Radio Krakow.

In a national poll taken just after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Poles were asked how they felt. The most common response: “I am afraid,” the choice of 78% of participants, according to the newspaper Rzeczpospolita. An additional 15.5% described themselves as worried; only 6.5% identified “calm” as their state of mind.

The conflict and its potential consequences for Poland are the prevalent topics of everyday conversation — at shops, on public transport, in parks and households. TV screens in bars, restaurants and homes relay the latest developments to edgy viewers.

“We can say that every single one of us is at war now, and fighting by doing whatever we can to help,” said Mikolaj Szlachta, 19, one of many volunteers in green vests assisting crowds of exhausted Ukrainian refugees at the central rail station in Krakow. “This is how we fight.”

The volunteers seen at train and bus depots throughout the country are part of an extraordinary outpouring of support for the massive influx of refugees who have fled into Poland since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. In the capital, Warsaw, the surge has approached a breaking point, with the mayor on Friday asking for international help. Many see the disastrous scenario unfolding in neighboring Ukraine as something that could also happen in Poland, which has for centuries been caught up in Great Power intrigues involving Russia, Germany and the former Austro-Hungarian empire.

“We still, as a nation, recall the history from World War II, when we were in this situation, when we were asking for help and we were asking for shelter and food,” said Karolina Micolajczyk, who manages a hotel in Krakow’s Kazimierz district.

A Ukrainian flag hangs outside the hotel. Ukrainians filled all 28 rooms on a recent evening, she said.

Traces of the last global conflagration are never far off in Poland. Both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union invaded at the outset of World War II, at a staggering cost in human life. The Kazimierz neighborhood was long the heart of Krakow’s Jewish community, which represented about one-quarter of the city’s prewar population before the Nazi mass murder campaign.

The former Jewish quarter is now a shabby-chic haven featuring hip bars, trendy cafes and boutique hotels. Signs in downtown Krakow feature bus tours to the infamous Nazi death camp at Auschwitz, an hour’s drive to the west.

The post-invasion fear of Russia has also hit the cultural sphere. A Warsaw orchestra recently decided to dedicate its performance to Ukraine and dropped a planned performance of a piano concerto by Sergei Rachmaninoff, the Russian composer. The orchestra substituted a concerto by Frederic Chopin, the Polish virtuoso.

There have also been scattered reports of harassment and vandalism. Ukrainians working for a Russian restaurant owner in Warsaw received threatening phone calls urging them to quit, according to reports widely circulated on social media. Meanwhile, Polish police were investigating the destruction of a Red Army monument in the northwestern city of Koszalin.

However, many Poles interviewed were quick to distinguish between the Russian people and its government.

“I don’t identify every Russian person with what’s happening in Ukraine,” said Szlachta, the student volunteering in the Krakow train station.

He, too, was skeptical that the invasion would escalate into Poland.

“I don’t think Russia’s leaders are dumb enough to attack a NATO country — that would mean a global conflict and World War III,” he said. “I hope it won’t get to that. But, then, anything can happen. You never know.”

The demand comes as some 3.8 million have fled Ukraine, with Poland currently hosting more than any EU state.

Student or retired? Then this plan is for you.

The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) says Poland has taken in over 2 million refugees. Of those more than 1.5 million remain in Poland, said EU home affairs commissioner Ylva Johansson.

""It is important to incentivise Ukrainians to leave Poland to go to other members,"" she told reporters on Monday (28 March) ahead of a meeting of interior ministers, noting that some 1 million have fanned out to other EU states.

It is not immediately clear how the EU plans on getting them to leave Poland. But a proposal by Germany and Poland seeks to give each Ukrainian refugee a flat fee of €1,000 for the first six months.

Johansson remained vague on whether the commission would support such an idea, noting instead that they are looking at how to inform those in Poland that they will receive the same rights elsewhere.

She also said the commission is looking at how to make EU funds immediately available to member states bordering Ukraine, plus possibly additional funds later on.

Out of the 3.8 million refugees from Ukraine that have fled, only around 800,000 have so far applied for temporary protection in the EU, she said.

The protection is an EU scheme that gives Ukrainian refugees residency and working rights up until next March.

France and Greece have each registered 15,000, said their interior ministers on Monday. That's more than double those registered in Hungary.

According to the UNHCR, some 350,000 Ukrainians went to Hungary. But of those, just under 6,000 registered in Hungary as of 23 March.

Austria by comparison has registered some 35,000 and Ireland around 13,500.

The EU wants to get a better idea on where people are settling in order to determine needs.

This includes centralising at the EU level, national registration schemes.

It also wants to know who is coming in and using an EU police database known as the Schengen Information System to catch possible trouble makers. Johansson said it had triggered a few hits.

Similar comments were made by French interior minister Gerald Darmanin, who was speaking on behalf of the French EU presidency.

But Darmanin said the risk of terrorists or Russian plotters coming from Ukraine was low given that the vast majority of those entering are women, children and the elderly.

""We have to check that they are not known by the police for terrorism. There may be attempts. We haven't seen any,"" said Darmanin.",https://euobserver.com/migration/154605

In the two weeks since Russia attacked Ukraine, more than 1.4 million Ukrainians have crossed into Poland — the largest influx of refugees the country has seen since World War II.

But there are no refugee camps. Instead, like the rush of boats sailing across the Channel to rescue trapped soldiers in France in 1940, hundreds of thousands of Polish people spontaneously mobilized to help: they give out tea, sandwiches and soup on the border, provide free transport across the country, gather bales of clothing to donate and offer spare rooms in their homes.

However, with the war showing no sign of ending there are signs that the bottom-up wave of help and hospitality is running out of steam.

Warsaw’s train stations and sports halls are filling up with camp beds or people sleeping in the rough as there simply aren’t enough free rooms in the country’s largest cities. Volunteers are engaged in increasingly testy exchanges with government officials they accuse of doing too little to help organize the relief effort and instead free-riding on the goodwill efforts of the population.

Joanna Niewczas, a volunteer coordinator in one of Warsaw’s sports halls, said in an appeal on LinkedIn that the facility is running out of food, medicines and hygiene products.

“The joke’s over, the governor [of the region Warsaw region] is only giving interviews that everything is under control, and we the volunteers are on the brink of physical and mental collapse,” she said.

Diverging narratives

The government insists all is fine.

“Everything is working as it should, there is no chaos,” said Konstanty Radziwiłł, governor of Mazovia province that includes the Polish capital, during a press conference. “In my opinion one can’t do more under these circumstances, at this pace and for such a big group of people.”

While the vast majority of the aid being given to Ukrainians in Poland is the result of volunteers, the government says it is playing a key coordinating role.

“This is the success of all the Polish people, but this success is made up of efficient coordination and cooperation between the government, the [local] administration, NGOs, and all people who got involved,” Paweł Szefernaker, the deputy minister of interior responsible for cooperation between the government and local authorities, told POLITICO.

The government is also basking in international praise, a big change from the recent past when it was more often subjected to criticism for backsliding on the EU’s democratic rules.

“I have seldom felt so emotional than the moment I saw Polish people receiving the refugees at the border with tea, taking them into their homes. Incredible. And that makes me a proud European,” Frans Timmermans, vice president of the European Commission, said on Monday.

But opposition parties and some volunteers say that the nationalist government led by the Law and Justice (PiS) party is taking political credit for the voluntary outpouring of aid — and that it has no plan for what to do when the number of refugees increases and people’s capacity to help runs out.

“This never-ending PR about how the government is heroically solving all the problems, it’s nothing else than a slap,” Marcin Kierwiński, secretary-general of Civic Platform, Poland’s main opposition party, said at a press conference. “A slap for millions of Poles who, regardless of the fact that the government is not doing anything, took the help for their Ukrainian brothers on their own shoulders.”

The tension is almost certain to get worse.

More than 100,000 people a day are crossing into Poland from Ukraine and the numbers fleeing show no sign of relenting as the Russian campaign bombards Ukraine’s eastern cities, causing growing numbers of civilian casualties. The UNHCR said Thursday that more than 2 million people had left Ukraine since the Russian invasion — Poland is a favored destination because it has a 500-kilometer border with Ukraine, is culturally and linguistically similar and already has over a million Ukrainians living and working in the country.

The interior ministry has mobilized border guards, the military, police and firefighters to ensure security and provide refugees with swift passage through the borders and transportation. Local authorities have also set up temporary reception and information centers in every Polish region.

“The central administration’s role is to secure the border, organize the work on the border, provide security through the uniformed services and organize train transports from the border to other towns in central Poland,” said Szefernaker. “We’re organizing this all.”

Helping arrivals

The Polish parliament on Wednesday approved new measures to help Ukrainians: permission to stay legally in the country for 18 months, speeding up the registration process, which will give them access to social security and health care systems, one-time handouts of 300 złoty (€62) and funds targeted at schools for new students. Families hosting refugees will also receive 40 złoty per day for two months for each person they house.

But volunteers and local officials say that isn’t enough to shelter and integrate such an enormous number of people.

Krzysztof Kosiński, the mayor of Ciechanów, a small town in central Poland that has organized four transports of goods for Ukrainians and is hosting 171 people, says the whole burden of accepting refugees lies on local authorities.

“Up until today, we haven’t got a single złoty from the state budget to spend on the aid for refugees,” he said, stressing that Polish cities will ask the European Commission and other governments which want to provide financial aid to Ukraine streamline the money straight to the local authorities.

The problem of financing is also raised by volunteers. Zosia Zochniak, who organized the collection and storage of clothes and other items for 500 refugees in Warsaw, published an Instagram post with an open letter to Poland’s President Andrzej Duda, asking him what’s next.

“In the last 10 days I hardly saw my daughters, I called off all the meetings at work, barely slept and ate, the storage space of my company, which gives employment and financial stability to 50 people, has turned into an aid space, and then asylum for people coming from Ukraine,” she said. She says she now wants to return to her normal life, but she doesn’t want to be indifferent to what’s happening.

“We want to join forces with you,” she told Duda. “To help you systemize this whole thing.”

The European Commission announced at least €500 million of additional EU funding to deal with the humanitarian crisis. The EU has also agreed to invoke the Temporary Protection Directive, allowing Ukrainians to stay and move around the bloc for up to three years with instant rights to live and work, and also offer them access to social service benefits like housing and medical care. They are also allowed to enter the EU without visas.

It’s not clear how many Ukrainians are staying in Poland and how many are moving west, but countries from Germany to Belgium are reporting growing numbers of refugees.

But even with larger numbers moving on, Poland’s Dunkirk moment of a massive volunteer effort is under strain. Szefernaker said that in the first days of the conflict, refugees often had relatives in Europe or a previously organized place to stay. Now many have nowhere to go.

“They’re escaping bombs falling down on civilian targets and those people reach Poland shocked, in some sort of war trauma. We see more and more people coming to the reception centers,” said Szefernaker.

The time of no refugee camps is drawing to an end. The reception centers are slowly turning into residence centers where people will be able to stay for longer.

“We’ve had a heartfelt response, but we’ll soon have an enormous problem,” Maciej Duszczyk, who studies migration at the University of Warsaw, told the Dziennik Gazeta Prawna newspaper. “Responsibility must be taken off the people who chose to accept refugees. We should say, ‘Thank you that you have accepted this family, now we are taking care of them.’ The state must regain control of this.”

The UN Refugee Agency's chief Filippo Grandi blamed the mass displacement on what he called a ""senseless war"" that began on February 24.

""The number of refugees from Ukraine, tragically, has reached today 2.5 million,"" Grandi tweeted.

""We also estimate that about two million people are displaced inside Ukraine. Millions forced to leave their homes by this senseless war.""

Paul Dillon, spokesman for the UN's International Organization for Migration, said the 2.5 million people who had fled Ukraine included 116,000 nationals from other countries.

The UNHCR had been working on the estimate that four million people may eventually seek to leave Ukraine as the war continues.

But the agency said that given the scale of the exodus in less than three weeks, it would be no surprise if that figure was exceeded.

""It is quite possible that that planning figure of four million might be revised up,"" UNHCR spokesman Matthew Saltmarsh told reporters in Geneva, speaking via videolink from Poland, close to the Ukrainian border.

He said the numbers of refugees was ""certainly unprecedented since World War II"".

Before Russia invaded, more than 37 million people lived in Ukrainian territory under the control of the central government in Kyiv.

More than half of those who have fled have gone to Poland.

Poland's border guards announced Friday that 1.52 million people fleeing Ukraine had crossed the frontier, with a further 87,000 people doing so on Thursday.

Poland has championed the cause of Ukrainian refugees. The government has set up reception centres and charities have mobilised in a massive aid effort, helped by the estimated 1.5 million Ukrainians already living in the EU member state.

Polish border guards said Thursday that 140,000 people had crossed from Poland into Ukraine since the invasion.

They largely fall into three categories: Ukrainian men working in Poland who returned to join the army, migrant workers returning to take care of relatives still in Ukraine, and recently-arrived refugees who have gone back for family reasons.

Several thousand refugees, once they have crossed Ukraine's western borders, have headed on to other countries.

Russian strikes hit civilian targets in central Ukraine's Dnipro city on Friday, as Moscow's troops edged closer to the capital Kyiv that, according to its Mayor Vitali Klitschko, has lost half of its estimated 3.5 million population since the war began.

Many refugees who make it to Poland have no idea how to get where they're going or where to wait for the next leg of their journey, which can sometimes take days. And that's where an American paratrooper on vacation in Poland decided to jump in and help.

U.S. Army Captain Sabastian Conour was on leave in Poland, visiting the Nazi death camp at Treblinka, when the Russian assault happened. Instead of taking his planned flight to Ireland, he grabbed a train to the Polish town of Przemysl, near the border with Ukraine, and started booking every hotel room he could find.

""I saw that human tragedy, I saw this unfolding, and I was like, I can't do nothing. It doesn't make any sense,"" Conour told CBS News correspondent Christina Ruffini.

He then went to a train station and stood on a crowded corner armed with a cardboard sign and Google Translate to carry out his self-appointed mission: finding rooms for refugees in transit.

""The only way I could think of to help these people was to get hotels and put them in a place where they could get a hot shower and a bed,"" Conour said.

Among those he helped were four women and a 6-year-old boy who came from Kyiv, Ukraine's capital. Their train for Warsaw didn't leave until the next day. So instead of sleeping at the station, they followed Conour about 15 minutes through cold cobblestone streets to this hostel, where they got four beds, free of charge.

One of the women said the decision to flee Ukraine came at the last minute.

""Even yesterday I didn't know if I should leave or if I should stay,"" she said.

In the face of overwhelming uncertainty, they said knowing they have a place to sleep tonight helps.

LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) -A barrage of Russian missiles hit a large Ukrainian base near the border with NATO member Poland on Sunday, killing 35 people and wounding 134, a local official said, in an escalation of the war to the west of the country as fighting raged elsewhere.

Russia's defence ministry said the air strike had destroyed a large amount of weapons supplied by foreign nations that were being stored at the sprawling training facility, and that it had killed ""up to 180 foreign mercenaries"".

Reuters could not independently verify the casualties reported by either side.

The attack on the Yavoriv International Centre for Peacekeeping and Security, a base just 15 miles (25 km) from the Polish border that has previously hosted NATO military instructors, brought the conflict to the doorstep of the Western defence alliance.

Russia had warned on Saturday that convoys of Western arms shipments to Ukraine could be considered legitimate targets.

Britain called the attack as a ""significant escalation,"" and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken responded with a post on Twitter saying ""the brutality must stop.""

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan, speaking on CBS's ""Face the Nation"", warned any attack on NATO territory would trigger a full response by the alliance.

Regional governor Maksym Kozytskyy said Russian planes fired around 30 rockets at the Yavoriv facility.

Russian defence ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov said Russia had used high-precision, long-range weapons to strike Yavoriv and a separate facility in the village of Starichi.

""As a result of the strike, up to 180 foreign mercenaries and a large amount of foreign weapons were destroyed,"" he said.

The 360-square km (140-square mile) facility is one of Ukraine's biggest and is the largest in the western part of the country, which has so far been spared the worst of the fighting.

Ukraine, whose aspirations to join NATO are a major irritant to Russian President Vladimir Putin, held most of its drills with Western countries at the base before the invasion. The last major exercises were in September.

In the weeks before Russia's Feb. 24 invasion, the Ukrainian military trained there, but according to Ukrainian media all foreign instructors left in mid-February, leaving behind equipment.

""The dining room and dormitory were destroyed. So were the barracks,"" said Colonel Leonid Benzalo, an officer in the Ukrainian medical reserve who was thrown across the room by one of the blasts. ""The most important thing is we're still alive,"" he told Reuters after treating the wounded there.

While Western nations have sought to isolate Putin by imposing harsh economic sanctions and have been supplying Ukraine with weapons, the United States and its allies are concerned to avoid NATO being drawn into the conflict.

""There are no NATO personnel in Ukraine,"" the NATO official said, when asked if anyone from the alliance was at the base.

STOCKPILING FOOD

Heavy fighting was reported on multiple fronts.

Air raid sirens wailed across the capital Kyiv and authorities said they were stockpiling two weeks worth of food for the 2 million people who have not yet fled from Russian forces attempting to encircle the city.

Ukraine reported renewed air strikes on an airport in the west and heavy shelling on Chernihiv, northeast of the capital.

Interior Ministry official Vadym Denyenko said Ukrainian forces were counterattacking in the eastern Kharkiv region and around the southern town of Mykolayiv. Reuters was not able to verify those statements.

An American journalist was shot and killed by Russian forces in the town of Irpin, northwest of Kyiv, and another journalist was wounded, the regional police chief said.

Britain's defence ministry said Russian naval forces had established a distant blockade of Ukraine's Black Sea coast, isolating the country from international maritime trade.

""We must hold on. We must fight. And we will win,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a nighttime video address.

Despite the violence, both sides gave their most upbeat assessment yet of prospects for progress at talks held periodically.

""Russia is already beginning to talk constructively,"" Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak said in a video online. ""I think that we will achieve some results literally in a matter of days.""

A Russian delegate to talks, Leonid Slutsky, was quoted by RIA news agency as saying they had made significant progress and it was possible the delegations could soon reach draft agreements.

Neither side said what these would cover. Three rounds of talks between the two sides in Belarus, most recently last Monday, had focused mainly on humanitarian issues.

Zelenskiy said the countries' delegations have been speaking daily by video link and a clear aim of his negotiators was to ""do everything"" to arrange for him to meet with Putin.

'VIOLENT AND INHUMAN'

In the weeks since the invasion began, Russia has asked China - which has not condemned the assault on Ukraine - for military equipment, the Financial Times and Washington Post cited unnamed U.S. officials as saying.

A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington said he had not heard of such a request and that the priority was to prevent the situation ""from escalating or even getting out of control.""

Russia's invasion has sent more than 2.5 million people fleeing across Ukraine's borders and trapped hundreds of thousands in besieged cities.

""It is terrifying how violent and inhuman it is,"" Olga, a refugee from Kyiv, told Reuters after crossing into Romania.

Ukraine's human rights monitor said Russia used phosphorous bombs in an overnight attack on the town of Popasna in the eastern Luhansk region, calling it a ""war crime"". She shared a photograph purporting to show the alleged attack. Reuters could not immediately verify any of the reports.

Phosphorus munitions can be used legally in war to provide light, create smokescreens or burn buildings. But its use in populated areas has been a persistent source of controversy.

In eastern Ukraine, Russian troops were trying to surround Ukrainian forces as they advance from the port of Mariupol in the south and the second city Kharkiv in the north, the British Defence Ministry said.

The city council in Mariupol said 2,187 residents had been killed since the start of the invasion. Reuters was not able to verify that toll.

Kharkiv has suffered some of the heaviest bombardment. Videos from one resident, Teimur Aliev, showed bombed buildings lining streets, burned-out cars riddled with shrapnel holes and debris strewn around.

""We will stitch up the wounds and the pain of our country and our city,"" said Aliev, a 23-year-old musician. ""We're not going anywhere.""

In Chernihiv, northeast of Kyiv, firefighters rescued residents from a burning building after heavy shelling, video from emergency service - and verified by Reuters - showed.

Moscow denies targeting civilians. It blames Ukraine for failed attempts to evacuate civilians from encircled cities, an accusation Ukraine and its Western allies strongly reject.

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said more than 140,000 people had been evacuated from conflict zones, but a humanitarian convoy had been unable to reach Mariupol due to shelling.

The Kremlin describes its actions as a ""special operation"" to demilitarise and ""deNazify"" Ukraine. Ukraine and Western allies call this a baseless pretext for a war of choice.

10,f768104b-d952-48bc-a913-b73502b5a90f,['Rfe Rl'],,"Russia's Defense Ministry warned on April 15 that it will intensify attacks on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, after accusing Ukraine of targeting Russian border towns.

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.
