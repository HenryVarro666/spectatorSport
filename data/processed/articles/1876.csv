On Mar. 31, 2022, following the statements regarding a reduction in activity around Kyiv, and reporting indicating the withdrawal of some units from these areas, Russian troops left their positions in Hostomel (or Gostomel) airport, near Kyiv. The move follows peace talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations in Istanbul on Tuesday and the plan of Moscow of moving some forces away from the area to refocus in Donetsk and Luhansk.

Although the withdrawal of some Russian forces from the area around the Ukrainian capital is seen by the Western intelligence as a “major” strategy shift by Moscow, and troops could be reversed again if the battle conditions allow, the liberation of Hostomel allowed a Ukrainian cinematographic company to launch a drone over the airport and film the widespread devastation at Antonov Airport, where a fierce battle between Ukrainian Armed Forces and Russians took place between Feb. 25 and 26, during the opening phases of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

﻿

The HD footage leaves little room for imagination: you can see the status of the buildings, aprons and, above all, the large hangar of the An-225 Mriya. The roof has partially collapsed, the front section of the world’s largest cargo aircraft completely destroyed. We can see that a “chunk” of the left wing is there, although its status is unclear. You can also spot some other light aircraft recovered in the same hangar.

We had already seen the images of the wreckage in footage shot by a Russian media outlet, but the drone video provides additional context.

On Mar. 24, 2022, Antonov kicked off a fundraiser to revive the “Mriya”.

“In February 2022 a disaster happened. During the aggression against Ukraine the An-225 “Mriya” plane was destroyed”, said a letter signed by Antonov CEO Sergii Bychkov, posted on social media. “This loss has stunned the team of Antonov DP, the global aviation community, numerous cargo customers of the largest aircraft. Despite the difficult times, the team of Antonov DP strongly considers it necessary to prevent the complete irreversible loss of the legendary aircraft as one of the symbols of modernity and to begin work on the restoration of the flagship of transport aviation, the An-225 “Mriya”. For this there are all things – structural and scientific and technical documentation, namely the main thing – presence, great desire and inspiration of the team of Antonov”. Unfortunately, in a difficult time for Ukraine Antonov, there is a lack of funds to carry out this task. We propose to establish the International Fund for the rebuilding of the transport aircraft An-225 “Mriya”.

As we commented, the letter does not say how much money the company needs to rebuild/restore the aircraft, if the remains of the aircraft have been already secured or moved, how much of the airframe has eventually survived; etc. and the post on Facebook received a significant amount of negative comments by people criticizing the fact that the aircraft was not moved to a safe spot before the invasion or that fundraising activities should be aimed at rebuilding houses destroyed in the war or given to childcare associations, etc. Anyway, the latest drone footage confirms that restoring or rebuilding the An-225 seems to be an extremely complex operation.",https://theaviationist.com/2022/04/01/drone-footage-hostomel/

The city houses Hostomel airport, the home base of Antonov company and the place where the Antonov An-225, the largest transport aircraft in the world, is stored.

The Armed Forces of Ukraine have not announced the capture of Hostomel yet, but numerous videos surfaced on social media showing Ukrainian soldiers entering the city.

Additionally, information on social media channels associated with Russian military suggests the units that held Hostomel Airport have been ordered to retreat.

During the evening of March 31 Youtube user BABYLON’13 posted drone footage showing what appears to be the abandoned Hostomel airport. Previous videos of the airport indicated that large contingents of Russian forces were entrenched there.

BABYLON’13’s video shows trenches and other encampments scattered around the territory of the airport. The wreck of the Antonov An-225 can also be seen, as well as extensive damage to hangars and other structures of the airport.

However, the concrete hangar in front of the wreck – where the second, unfinished airframe of the An-225 is reportedly housed – appears to be standing, despite numerous holes in its walls.

Russian forces attempted to capture Hostomel airport on February 24, the first day of the invasion. According to numerous reports, the airport changed hands several times in the subsequent days.

Several days later the first pictures and video footage showing the destroyed An-225 were posted online.

On Thursday, an official with the US Department of Defense told CNN they believed that the Russian military had likely left the airport. The new satellite images, taken on Thursday from Maxar Technologies, confirm they have.

Previous satellite images showed that, around military vehicles and artillery positions, the Russians had constructed protective earthen berms. Now, just the berms remain.

The capture of the Antonov airfield was the first major victory notched by the Russians on the first day of the war — Feb. 24. A number of transport and attack helicopters ambushed the base, and the Ukrainian soldiers at it; CNN even witnessed some intense firefight at the base.

Since then, Ukrainian forces held strong against the Russian advance; they never made it closer to western Kyiv. Intense firefights took place along the Irpin River and the towns of Irpin and Bucha, just south of the air base and the surrounding village of Hostomel.

And for weeks, the Russian Ministry of Defense released a number of videos praising the ease at which they claimed to have taken the air base. Russian state media echoed those claims, even travelling with troops around the airport as evidence for how safe the area was.

Now, the abandonment is just another example of Russia’s waning military success around the Ukrainian capital.

At this time, it’s unclear where the military and artillery vehicles went. Russia has previously claimed that it would decrease its military activity around Kyiv. All the military forces and vehicles that were positioned west of Kyiv came from Belarus.

The Russians aren’t saying if they returned to Belarus, and thick cloud cover is currently preventing any satellite imagery from tracking Russian troop movements in the area.",https://7news.com.au/news/ukraine/russian-forces-withdraw-from-antonov-airport-outside-of-kyiv-satellite-images-confirm-c-6298697

Zelenskyy: Troops shell retreating Russians LVIV, Ukraine – President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukrainian troops retaking areas around Kyiv and Chernihiv are not allowing Russians to retreat without a fight, but are “shelling them. They are destroying everyone they can.” Zelenskyy, in his Saturday night video address to the nation, said Ukraine knows Russia has the forces to put even more pressure on the east and south of Ukraine. “What is the goal of the Russian troops? They want to seize the Donbas and the south of Ukraine,” he said. “What is our goal? To defend ourselves, our freedom, our land and our people.” He said a significant portion of the Russian forces are tied up around Mariupol, where the city’s defenders continue to fight. “Thanks to this resistance, thanks to the courage and resilience of our other cities, Ukraine has gained invaluable time, time that is allowing us to foil the enemy’s tactics and weaken its capabilities,” Zelenskyy said.

Lithuania says it's the first European country to fully nix Russian natural gas Lithuania on Saturday declared it has completely cut off Russian natural gas imports, becoming the first European Union nation to fully nix supplies from Russia's state-owned fuel supplier, Gazprom, its Ministry of Energy said in a statement. The country has been headed toward freedom from Russian natural gas since before the February invasion of Ukraine, the ministry said. Citing data from a transmission system operator, the ministry said it had no traces of the Russian fuel in its pipelines. ""We are the first EU country among Gazprom's supply countries to gain independence from Russian gas supplies, and this is the result of a multi-year coherent energy policy and timely infrastructure decisions,"" said Minister of Energy Dainius Kreivys said in the statement. Lithuanians are dependent on liquified natural gas imported through the Klaipėda Oil Terminal, the ministry said, and other imports are ""enough"" to satisfy its heating and cooking needs. If necessary, the country could also open gas delivery through Latvia and, starting in May, Poland, the ministry said. Share this -







200 arrested across Russia at anti-war demonstrations, watchdog group says A Russian group that monitors political arrests says 208 people were detained in demonstrations held Saturday across the country protesting Russia’s military operation in Ukraine. The OVD-Info group said demonstrations took place in 17 Russian cities, from Siberia to the more densely populated west. More than 70 people were detained in Moscow and a similar number in St. Petersburg, the organization said. Video released by another group that monitors protests, Avtozak, showed some detainees being led to police prisoner transports as they smiled and carried flowers. Others were shown to be more harshly forced into the transports, bent over with their arms pinioned behind them.

Breakaway area denies Russian troops massing CHISINAU, Moldova — Authorities in the tiny breakaway region of Transnistria in Moldova denied “absolutely untrue” claims Saturday by Ukraine that Russian troops based there had been massing to conduct “provocations” along Ukraine’s border. Earlier Saturday, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said that Russian troops already in Transnistria were preparing for “a demonstration of readiness for the offensive and, possibly, hostilities against Ukraine.” “The information disseminated by the General Staff of Ukraine is absolutely untrue,” Transnistria’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement, adding that leaders had repeatedly “declared the absence of any threat to Ukraine.” Moldova’s Foreign Ministry also said Saturday there is “no information to confirm the mobilization of troops in the Transnistrian region” and that “state institutions are closely monitoring the security situation in the region.” Transnistria is a Russia-backed region of Moldova that broke away after a short civil war in the early 1990s, and is unrecognized by most countries. An estimated 1,500 Russian soldiers are stationed there. Share this -

Pope Francis blasts Putin for launching 'savage' war Pope Francis Saturday blasted Russian President Vladimir Putin for launching a “savage” war. Speaking after his arrival in Malta, he delivered his most pointed and personalized denunciation yet of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Pope Francis didn’t cite Russian President Vladimir Putin by name, but the reference was clear when he said that “some potentate” had unleashed the threat of nuclear war on the world in an “infantile and destructive aggression” under the guise of “anachronist claims of nationalistic interests.” “We had thought that invasions of other countries, savage street fighting and atomic threats were grim memories of a distant past,” Francis told Maltese officials and diplomats on the Mediterranean island nation at the start of a weekend visit. Francis has to date avoided referring to Russia or Putin by name. But Saturday’s personalization of the powerful figure responsible marked a new level of outrage for the pope. “Once again, some potentate, sadly caught up in anachronistic claims of nationalist interest, is provoking and fomenting conflicts, whereas ordinary people sense the need to build a future that will either be shared or not be at all,” he said.

Russia to end cooperation over International Space Station if sanctions are not lifted Russia will look to end mutual cooperation on the International Space Station if Western sanctions against the country are not lifted, the head of the country's space agency said Saturday. Dmitry Rogozin said in a series of tweets that the U.S, European Union and Canadian space agencies had responded to letters he sent demanding the removal of sanctions against corporations connected to the Russian aerospace industry. ""From our perspective it is clear that sanctions will not be lifted,"" he wrote, adding that he found ""such a state of affairs ... unacceptable."" As a result, he said he believed that the revival of normal relations between Roscosmos and its ISS partners was only possible when the sanctions were lifted. Proposals for the completion or termination of mutual cooperation ""will be presented to our country’s government in the nearest future,"" he added. In separate comments to reporters broadcast on Russian state TV, Rogozin emphasized that Western partners needed the ISS and ""cannot manage without Russia, because no one but us can deliver fuel to the station."" Rogozin added that ""only the engines of our cargo craft are able to correct the ISS's orbit, keeping it safe from space debris."" Share this -







Ex-ICC prosecutor declares Putin 'a war criminal' GENEVA —The former chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has called for an international arrest warrant to be issued for Russian President Vladimir Putin. “Putin is a war criminal,” Carla Del Ponte told the Swiss newspaper Le Temps in an interview published Saturday. In interviews given to Swiss media to mark the release of her latest book, the Swiss lawyer who oversaw ICC war crimes investigations in Rwanda, Syria and the former Yugoslavia, said there were clear war crimes being committed in Ukraine. She said she was particularly shocked by the use of mass graves, which recalls the worst of the wars in former Yugoslavia. “I hoped never to see mass graves again,” she told the newspaper Blick. “These dead people have loved ones who don’t even know what’s become of them. That is unacceptable.” Other war crimes she identified in Ukraine included attacks on civilians, the destruction of civilian buildings and even of entire towns. Share this -

Russia declares top journalist and video blogger 'foreign agents' Russia has declared a prominent journalist, a video blogger and six other media figures ""foreign agents,"" the latest in a series of such moves that critics say are designed to stifle dissent. The expanded list, published by the Justice Ministry late on Friday, included Elizaveta Osetinskaya, former editor-in-chief of several Russian business newspapers that published disclosures about the commercial interests of people close to President Vladimir Putin. The term ""foreign agent"" carries negative Soviet-era connotations and subjects those listed to stringent financial reporting requirements. It also obliges them to preface anything they publish with a disclaimer stating they are foreign agents. The list also included Maria Borzunova, a reporter from the independent TV Rain (Dozhd) channel, which was itself declared a ""foreign agent"" last August and suspended its work after Russia blocked access to its website in March. Evgeny Ponasenkov, a writer and video blogger, known for witty off-the-cuff remarks taking aim at the government on social media and talk shows on state-run TV channels, was also named a ""foreign agent.""

The Venice foundation will oversee a shipment of special fabric that can cover paintings and graphic art as well as furniture, costumes and materials made from glass or marble to protect the objects from the majority of solvents and gasses. The fabric also impedes mold and fungus growth while the works are in storage. Also being sent are polyethylene foam shock-resistant panels. Venice museums experts also gave advice in a video call with the Lviv gallery’s management about how to best store artworks. Share this -
