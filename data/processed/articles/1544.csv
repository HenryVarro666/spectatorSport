Addressing a media briefing, Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said on Thursday that Russian forces also hit 60 Ukrainian military facilities over the past day, including two command posts, two multiple launch rocket systems, four ammunition depots, and 47 sites with equipment and military hardware, Xinhua news agency reported.

Meanwhile, according to a spokesman for the Regional Military Administration of Ukraine's southern Black Sea port city of Odessa, the city came under shelling from Russian warships on Thursday.

The strikes were aimed at putting ""psychological pressure"" on Odessa residents, Bratchuk said on Facebook, without providing information on whether there were any casualties in the incident.

Earlier in the day, the press service of the Ukrainian Naval Forces said on Facebook that the military destroyed the Orsk large landing ship of the Russian forces near the southeastern city of Berdyansk.

Moscow, Mar 24 (EFE).- Russia said on Thursday that its forces have taken full control of the besieged city of Izyum in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region, where heavy fighting has been seen in recent days.

“By the morning of Mar.24, units of the Russian army completely took control of the city of Izyum,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesperson Igor Konashénkov told reporters.

“The armed forces of the Russian Federation continue to carry out the tasks of a special military operation,” he said.

Konashenkov said that Russian aircraft destroyed 60 military targets in Ukraine overnight, including four ammunition depots and two drones.

The war in Ukraine entered the second month on Thursday with United Nations saying the conflict has forced more than 3.5 million refugees leave the country.

“This is really another tragic milestone for the people of Ukraine and it’s been achieved in just under one month,” said Matthew Saltmarsh, spokesperson for the UN refugee agency.

The UN estimates that between Feb.24 and Mar.15, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights recorded 1,900 civilian casualties – with 726 people killed, including 52 children – mostly caused by explosive weapons in populated areas.

UN chief António Guterres Tuesday said it was time for a diplomatic solution to be found to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, amidst signs of hope that progress could be made to end an “unwinnable” and “indefensible” war.

“Sooner or later, it will have to move from the battlefield to the peace table. This is inevitable,” Guterres told journalists outside the Security Council in New York.

“The only question is: How many more lives must be lost? “How many more bombs must fall? How many more Mariupols must be destroyed? How many more Ukrainians and Russians will be killed before everyone realizes that this war has no winners – only losers?” EFE

Intense clashes around Izyum have left much of the city destroyed, city officials say, with new satellite images revealing the extent of the devastation in the eastern Ukrainian city.

The images were taken on Thursday by Maxar Technologies.

They show a massive crater about 40 feet (12 meters) wide in a field in the city's central area. The burnt wreckage of a school lies on one side of the crater, with a football field on the other. Part of a hospital across the street is also seen destroyed.

The city has been caught in the crossfire as Russia attempts to link advances made in the Kharkiv region of northern Ukraine with its stronghold in the far east of the country.

Council deputy Max Strelnyk told CNN on Thursday the city had been “completely destroyed” by Russian aircraft and artillery, even as fierce battles continued inside Izyum for control of the ground.

North of the school in the satellite images, a large boiler building and every nearby residential building appears destroyed. There does not appear to be any identifiable military targets in this part of central Izyum.

About 3 miles (5 kilometers) northwest of Izyum, a convoy of Russian self-propelled artillery is seen moving toward the city.

Russian troops now control the city sectors on the northern bank of the Seversky Donets River, which splits Izyum in half, Strelnyk said. The Ukrainians control the city sectors on the southern bank of the river.

Three miles northeast of the city, Russian self-propelled artillery are also seen positioned in a field, their turrets pointing toward central Izyum.

Another image shows two vehicle bridges crossing the Seversky Donets River have been partially destroyed, in what appears to be a purposeful strike to stop a Russian advance across the river.

But the Russians have found a way around, and are now advancing on the city from the south.

To bypass the blown bridges, the Russians have erected two pontoon bridges over the Seversky Donets River to encircle the city. A mile from those bridges, on the southern bank of the river, a convoy of tanks are seen moving along a highway toward the Ukrainian-controlled sectors of Izyum.",https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-25-22/h_433089da41a81c3e3806b5070cee97ac
