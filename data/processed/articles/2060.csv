LONDON: A British journalist captured by Daesh, John Cantlie, used his final letter to beg Western governments to pay a $100 million ransom for his release from captivity in Syria.

Cantlie told his family that he feared execution if it was not paid, telling loved ones that Britian and the US were “the most hated” by the terror group.

The letter has been released by US prosecutors following the conviction on Thursday of El Shafee Elsheikh, the final member of the so-called “Beatles” group to face justice or be killed on the battlefield. Cantlie was a known held by the group, made up of British terrorists in Syria.

Cantlie wrote: “The amount is extremely high, but it is the only way the rest of us here will ever be released. If the money is not found we will remain prisoners here until we die, either by natural causes or executions.”

His note was smuggled to his London-based girlfriend by Federico Motka, an Italian aid worker who was released by the Beatles in May 2014 just weeks before they started beheading hostages on camera.

The letter is part of a trove of evidence exposing the evil of the group, with images of tiny cells, chains, shackles and weapons.

Cantlie was moved regularly, being held in at least eight different prisons held by Daesh terrorists. One was nicknamed “the box,” another “the dungeon.”

Unlike British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines, who were decapitated by Mohammed Emwazi, also known as Jihadi John, Cantlie was not executed on camera, and was last seen in December 2016 in Mosul, Iraq.

In April 2014, Didier François and three other French journalists under Daesh capture, were set to be released after the French governments appeared to pay a ransom.

Cantlie attempted to smuggle a letter to his girlfriend Charlie and family members in Britain.

“Dearest Charlie and family,” he wrote in capital letters. “The group holding us has just released four French journalists. And Didier François is carrying this letter.

“The group continues to release prisoners whose countries have paid their ransom demands.

“For the six British and American prisoners, the group are demanding a total of $100 million.”

He added that an American Daesh prisoner, Kayla Mueller, could be released if an infamous Pakistani terrorist known as “Lady Al-Qaeda,” Aafia Siddiqui, was free in a prisoner swap.

“The British and American governments are the most hated by this group and therefore they are demanding the most for us,” Cantlie continued.

“The amount is extremely high but it is the only way the rest of us here will ever be released.”

He added: “Didier François knows all about the situation here. Liaise with him on the matter.

“We are all so sorry to put you in this very difficult situation. We love all our families and pray you are all holding up in this situation.”

François did not manage to take the note from jail after the French paid for his freedom. Motka is thought to have smuggled the letter out of Syria one month later after the government in Rome paid what is believed to be a $6.5 million ransom for the journalist.",https://www.arabnews.com/node/2041091/world

Croatia criticises NATO after crash of Russian-made drone

Croatian officials criticised NATO for what they said was its slow reaction to a military drone that apparently flew from the Ukrainian war zone through the airspace of three NATO member states, before crashing in the Croatian capital.

The Russian-made unmanned aircraft crossed Romania and Hungary before entering Croatia and slamming late Thursday into a field near a student dormitory. Some 40 parked cars were damaged but no one was injured after a loud blast.

“We cannot tolerate this situation, nor should it have ever happened,” Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said while visiting the crash site. “This was a pure and clear threat and both NATO and the EU should have reacted,” he said. “We will work to raise the readiness not only of us but of others as well,” he added.

Correspondent: Strong smell of explosives in Kyiv

Al Jazeera’s Step Vaessen, reporting from Kyiv, said there is a smell of explosions and explosives in the city as Russian forces advance.

“[The smell is] really strong; it’s getting closer in the last days and even hours. You hear a lot more artillery fire, shelling; it’s mainly been coming from the northwest, a town called Irpin. There’s been heavy fighting for days [there] already,” Vaessen said.

“[Irpin] is basically the entrance into the capital, so it’s a very strategic point for the Ukrainian army and towns around Irpin have already fallen in Russian hands. Irpin is very much the last point before Russian forces can enter the capital.

“Also on the northwest flank of the capital, you can see that Russian forces are closing in … There was a huge bombardment this morning; eight rockets were fired at an air base in the south, so it’s very much a sense here that there’s going to be an encirclement around the capital. We don’t know when … no one knows how fast Russian forces are advancing.”

Aid workers warn over risks of human trafficking

Concerns on how to protect women from becoming victims of human trafficking at border crossing are growing.

Mornay, a former member of the French Foreign Legion who is helping refugees at the Medyka border crossing between Poland and Ukraine, told The Associated Press news agency that his team found three men trying to get several women into a van.

“I cannot say 100 percent they were trying to recruit them for sex trafficking, but when we approach them they got nervous and they just left immediately,” he said.

Romania’s local authorities also told AP they have been working on advising women to make sure to have their phone battery charged and to remember the car’s tag they board once they have crossed the border.

Annual global profit over sexual exploitation is around $32bn, a European Union commission report showed, a figure that rises during humanitarian crisis. “The risk of some capitalising on the pain of these people is very high,” said Andreea Bujor, an aid worker with World Vision Romania.

UN experts say Russian media law amounts to information ‘blackout’

A Russian law giving Moscow stronger powers to crack down on independent journalism is placing Russia under a “total information blackout” on the war in Ukraine, UN independent experts have said.

Moscow last week blocked Facebook and other websites and passed a law that imposed a prison term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally “fake” news about the military.

“Russia’s recent adoption of a punitive ‘fake war news’ law is an alarming move by the government to gag and blindfold an entire population,” three independent UN experts appointed by the top UN rights body, the Human Rights Council, said in a statement.

” … the law places Russia under a total information blackout on the war and in so doing gives an official seal of approval to disinformation and misinformation,” they continued.

She also said that a tighter monetary policy to fight inflation could cause a recession, but she had confidence in the Federal Reserve’s ability to balance that.

UK says Russia attacked western Ukraine cities

The United Kingdom has said Russian air and missile forces had conducted raids in the past 24 hours against the western Ukrainian cities of Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk.

Russian tactical aircraft supporting the advance of Russian ground forces were primarily relying on unguided “dumb” munitions, the UK Ministry of Defence intelligence update posted on Twitter said.

Russia accused of using cluster munitions, incendiary weapons

Oleksandra Matviichuk, head of the Center for Civil Liberties in Kyiv, said the group has gathered evidence of Russian forces using unguided bombs, cluster munitions and incendiary weapons.

“That’s why we have so [many] casualties among civilian populations,” Matviichuk told Al Jazeera.

She added that the centre also has gathered evidence of deliberate Russian bombings of civilian infrastructure and humanitarian corridors along which civilians are seeking to leave conflict areas. Russia has denied it targets civilians.

Prosecutor Karim A A Khan said in a statement that he is “closely following the deeply troubling developments in hostilities”, after recent reports of Russian attacks on hospitals and other civilian infrastructure.

“If attacks are intentionally directed against the civilian population: that is a crime. If attacks are intentionally directed against civilian objects: that is a crime. I strongly urge parties to the conflict to avoid the use of heavy explosive weapons in populated areas,” he said.

Technicians repairing damaged power lines at Chernobyl, IAEA says

Ukraine has informed the UN’s atomic energy watchdog that technicians have started repairing damaged power lines in an effort to restore external electricity supplies to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant site.

Electricity supplies to the plant, which is currently under Russian control, were cut off entirely earlier this week, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a statement.

“Ukraine’s regulatory authority said work that began on the evening of 10 March had succeeded in repairing one section, but off-site electrical power was still down, indicating there was still damage in other places,” the statement said.

Russian shelling prevents Mariupol evacuation, Ukraine says

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk has said Russian shelling prevented evacuees from leaving the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, while Russian forces also stopped some buses of people trying to flee the Kyiv region.

In a video address, Vereshchuk said some planned evacuations were successful, including 1,000 people who were evacuated from the village of Vorzel, in the Ukrainian capital area.

Russian forces have laid siege to Mariupol, and Ukraine says 1,582 civilians have died there since the invasion began.

Kramer', 'The New York Times', 'Keith Gessen', 'Maria Varenikova']",2022-03-12 00:00:00,"Smoke rising over Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, early Saturday morning after a night of heavy Russian bombardment.

LVIV, Ukraine — Russian forces stepped up their campaign of bombardments aimed at devastating Ukraine’s cities and towns on Saturday, as the White House announced it was sending an additional $200 million in arms and equipment to help Ukraine, defying Moscow.

Soldiers fought street-by-street battles in a leafy suburb of Kyiv, the nation’s capital, and some residents wept as they dragged belongings across a destroyed bridge, trying to escape the violence. Russian forces detained the mayor of a captured city, an act that prompted hundreds of outraged residents to pour into the streets in protest.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine accused Moscow of terrorizing the country in an attempt to break the will of the people. “A war of annihilation,” he called it.

He said an estimated 1,300 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed in the war, the first time the government had offered the number of its own soldiers killed.

Mr. Zelensky denounced what he called the kidnapping of the mayor — who had refused to cooperate with Russian troops after they seized his city — as “a new stage of terror, when they are trying to physically eliminate representatives of the legitimate local Ukrainian authorities.”

Russian forces have not achieved a major military victory since the first days of the invasion more than two weeks ago, and the assaults reinforced Moscow’s strategic turn toward increasingly indiscriminate shelling of civilian targets.

The American announcement of more arms for Ukraine’s military, including missiles for taking out warplanes and tanks, came just hours after Russia warned that convoys used for the “thoughtless transfer” of weapons to Ukraine would be “legitimate targets” for Russian forces.

Unable to mount a quick takeover of the country by air, land and sea, Russian troops have deployed missiles, rockets and bombs to destroy apartment buildings, schools, factories and hospitals, increasing civilian carnage and suffering, and leading more than 2.5 million people to flee the country.

The suffering has been particularly devastating in the besieged city of Mariupol, which is experiencing “the worst humanitarian catastrophe on the planet,” according to Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba.

At least 1,582 civilians have died since the Russian siege of Mariupol began 12 days ago, he said, and residents are struggling to survive and have been forced to bury the dead in mass graves.

“There is no drinking water and any medication for more than one week, maybe even 10 days,” a staff member who works for Doctors Without Borders in Mariupol said in an audio recording released by the organization on Saturday.

“We saw people who died because of lack of medication, and there are a lot of such people inside Mariupol,” the staff member said.

During a 90-minute call with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France urged Mr. Putin to accept an immediate cease-fire, according to the French government, which described the talks as “frank” and “difficult.”

France said that Mr. Putin showed no willingness to stop the war, and said he “placed the responsibility for the conflict on Ukraine” and sounded “determined to attain his objectives.”

In its summary of the call, the Kremlin said Mr. Putin had discussed “several matters relating to agreements being drafted to meet the well-known Russian demands,” but did not specify those demands.

In the coming weeks, NATO, which has vowed to defend allied countries from any incursion by Russian forces, plans to gather 30,000 troops from 25 countries in Europe and North America in Norway to conduct live-fire drills and other cold-weather military exercises.

The exercises, which Norway hosts biannually, were announced more than eight months ago, NATO said, and are not linked to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which NATO said it was responding to with “preventive, proportionate and non-escalatory measures.”

But the training has taken on greater significance as Russia steps up its bombardment of Ukrainian population centers.

Around Kyiv, the capital, Russian forces have advanced into the suburbs but have been slowed by Ukrainian troops that have counterattacked with ambushes on armored columns. On Saturday, artillery fire intensified around Kyiv, with a low rumble heard in most parts of the city.

By Saturday, there were no indications of further efforts by the Russian army to move armored columns closer to the capital. Instead, soldiers appeared to be fighting for control of the towns along the highways that encircle it.

In Irpin, about three miles from Kyiv city limits, Ukrainian and Russian soldiers were fighting a street-by-street battle on Saturday, turning what was a quiet suburb just two weeks ago into a suburban battleground.

“We are trying to push them back but we don’t control the town,” said Vitaly, a Ukrainian soldier who asked that his last name not be published for security reasons.

He had taken up a position outside what would once have been an unlikely spot for combat: a gas station mini-market, its windows blown out by shelling, on the city’s western edge. Irpin is his hometown, and he joined the volunteer forces called the Territorial Defense Forces to try to protect it just two weeks ago.

He described Irpin’s Unity Street as Ukrainian-controlled; Central Street as a no-man’s land, exposed to both Ukrainian and Russian forces; and University Street as taken by Russian forces.

But the situation was fluid. Ukrainian soldiers had a “little island” around a shopping center near the city center, he said, but otherwise it wasn’t always clear who was where.

In the southern city of Mykolaiv, residents awoke on Saturday morning to the sounds of a fierce battle hours after Russian shells hit several civilian areas, damaging a cancer hospital and sending residents fleeing into bomb shelters.

The early-morning fight was concentrated in the north of the city, said Col. Sviatoslav Stetsenko of the Ukrainian Army’s 59th Brigade, who was stationed near the front lines.

“They are changing their tactics,” Vitaliy Kim, the governor of the Mykolaiv region, said. “They are deploying in the villages and lodging in village schools and homes. We cannot shoot back. There are no rules now. We will have to be more brutal with them.”

For nearly two weeks, Russian forces have been trying to surround Mykolaiv and cross the Southern Buh River, which flows through the city and is a natural defense against a Russian push toward the west and Odessa, the Black Sea port that appears to be a prime Russian objective.

Russian forces had not crossed the river as of Saturday morning, Colonel Stetsenko said, but “they are continuing to shell Mykolaiv.”

In Melitopol, Russian troops on Friday forced a hood over the mayor’s head and dragged him from a government building, according to Ukrainian officials, prompting hundreds of residents to demonstrate in the streets.

“Return the mayor!” the protesters shouted, according to witnesses and videos. “Free the mayor!”

But nearly as soon as the demonstrators gathered, Russian military personnel moved to shut them down, arresting a woman who they said had organized the protest, according to two witnesses and the woman’s Facebook account.

The episode was part of what Ukrainian officials said was an escalating pattern of intimidation and repression. It also illustrated a problem that Russia is likely to face even if it manages to pummel cities and towns into submission: In at least some of the few cities and towns that Russia has managed to seize — mostly in the south and east — they are facing popular unrest and revolt.

Mr. Zelensky sought to tap into public rage in an address to the nation overnight.

“The whole country saw that Melitopol did not surrender to the invaders,” he said. “Just as Kherson, Berdyansk and other cities where Russian troops managed to enter didn’t.” He said that popular resistance “will not be changed by putting pressure on mayors or kidnapping mayors.”

Melitopol’s mayor, Ivan Fyodorov, had remained stubbornly defiant even after Russian soldiers took over the city after a fierce assault on the first day of the invasion. “We are not cooperating with the Russians in any way,” he had said.

Last weekend, with Mr. Fyodorov’s encouragement, people waving Ukrainian flags took to the streets of Melitopol and other occupied cities. For the most part, Russian soldiers stood aside, even as protesters commandeered a Russian armored vehicle in one town and drove it through the streets.

While the protests in Melitopol were quickly put down, the Ukrainian government renewed efforts to bring aid to Mariupol, dispatching dozens of buses with food and medicine, Ukrainian officials said.

Similar relief efforts had failed in recent days as fighting raged around the city and land mines pocked roads in the area. In an overnight address, Mr. Zelensky said that the inability to bring aid to the city showed that Russian troops “continue to torture our people, our Mariupol residents.”

Still, he said, “We will try again.”

Russia has made dire threats to the West that any military shipments to Ukraine will be seen as 'legitimate targets', prompting fears there could be an escalation of conflict that could suck in other countries.

It comes as Ukrainian President Vlodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of shooting children and said Vladimir Putin's forces will only take Kyiv if they 'raze the city to the ground', with Kremlin troops inching closer to the capital and conflict raging nearby today, endangering attempted evacuations.

Deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov warned the US 'that pumping weapons from a number of countries it orchestrates isn't just a dangerous move, it's an action that makes those convoys legitimate targets', after Joe Biden personally intervened to stop a shipment of Polish MiG fighter jets to Kyiv, fearing the move could lead to 'World War Three'.

But Volodymyr Zelensky has slammed the West for its inaction, saying today he 'doesn't see any bravery from NATO' as he pleaded for more involvement from allies in peace negotiations and offered to pay for more anti-missile systems. In response, the US made lukewarm promises of taking 'diplomatic steps' to help the Ukrainian government.

Zelensky, who claimed 1,300 Ukrainian troops have been killed so far and 500 Russians surrendered yesterday, added: 'If they decide to carpet bomb (Kyiv), and simply erase the history of this region, the history of the Kyivan Rus, the history of Europe, and destroy all of us, then they will enter Kyiv. If that's their goal, let them come in, but they will have to live on this land by themselves.'

Senior Russian officials incredulously flipped the narrative on its head on Saturday, warning that the humanitarian situation was deteriorating because of the actions of the country's armed forces - and even accusing Ukraine of shelling its own people.

'The humanitarian situation in Ukraine, unfortunately, continues to rapidly worsen, and in some cities has reached catastrophic proportions,' RIA quoted Mikhail Mizintsev, head of the Russian National Defence Control Centre, as saying.

Mizintsev, who said Russian forces were observing ceasefires, said Ukrainian forces had mined residential neighbourhoods and destroyed bridges and roads. Ukraine has complained repeatedly that Russian forces do not always respect ceasefires so civilians can leave through evacuation corridors.

Moscow's troops continue to use indiscriminate shelling to encircle key Ukrainian cities and are said to be bearing down on Kyiv for an 'all-out assault' in the coming days.

Satellite images taken on Saturday morning showed extensive damage to civilian infrastructure and residential buildings throughout the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, a private US company said.

Maxar Technologies said fires were seen in the western section of the Black Sea port city and dozens of high-rise apartment buildings had been severely damaged.

But there appear to be signs of slight progress in negotiations, with Zelensky saying the warring countries have begun discussing 'concrete' proposals rather than just 'exchanging ultimatums', although he said any negotiations must begin with a ceasefire.

The conciliatory tone was not resonating in the Kremlin though, with Putin raging after a 75-minute call with Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz that Ukraine was guilty of 'extrajudicial reprisals against dissidents, taking civilians hostage, using them as human shields, [and] putting heavy armaments in civilian areas near hospitals, schools, kindergartens'.

Scholz and Macron implored Putin to end the war and stop the brutal siege of Mariupol but a French official said he did not show any willingness for calling off his inhumane invasion.

Russian armoured vehicles are still slowly advancing on Kyiv's northeast after being stalled for days, and a military airfield south of the city in Vasylkiv has been hit by missiles, destroying the runway, a fuel depot and an ammunition store.

The bulk of Russian ground forces are now around 15 miles from the centre but elements of the large column have dispersed in a bid to encircle the city, after pummelling the northwest suburbs including Irpin and Bucha.

A column of thick black smoke was seen rising from the eastern suburbs of Kyiv this morning, but there is still no sign of ground forces moving into the outskirts.

But a former NATO official said she is 'sceptical' that Russian forces will 'gain much success' from an expected brutal onslaught of Kyiv, as Ukrainians warned Putin to prepare for his own Stalingrad battle.

Former deputy Secretary General Rose Gottemoeller says she believes current tactics betray a sign of weakness from Putin's forces, saying she is 'sceptical' of any success in the capital.

She slammed their poor logistics saying she does not believe they have enough fuel supply for battle in the city which has faced constant shelling but is still bracing for an all-out assault.

Three Russian generals out of 20 have been killed so far in Putin's botched invasion, which has also seen the loss of 173 tanks, 12 aircraft and 345 troop carriers.

In an address to the nation today, Zelensky said Ukraine has inflicted Russia's heaviest losses in decades, claiming 31 battalion tactical groups have been rendered incapable of combat.

The president also demanded the release of the kidnapped mayor of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, who was seized after he 'refused to cooperate with the enemy', sparking protests of 2,000 people in the southern city.

It comes as Russian attacks are continuing throughout the county today despite a supposed ceasefire to allow trapped citizens to escape in evacuation routes.

Donetsk governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said: 'Humanitarian cargo is moving towards Mariupol, we will inform you how it develops... The situation is complicated, there is constant shelling.'

Putin's troops have also shelled a mosque housing 86 people including 34 children in the besieged city of Mariupol, whose eastern outskirts have now fallen into Russian hands. It is not yet known if there are any casualties.

A convoy loaded with 90 tonnes of food and medicine left the town of Zaporizhzhia for Mariupol on Saturday, according to local officials, with hopes that it will be able to evacuate civilians on the way back. Ukraine's emergency services said 487,000 people had been evacuated over the past 24 hours, including 102,000 children.

Mykolaiv remains under heavy bombardment, while new artillery and air attacks have targeted Dnipro and Kropyvnytskyi.

In captured Kherson, which is under Russian control, a pseudo 'referendum' will be held on the creation of a new breakaway Kherson People's Republic, but few expect the vote to be legitimate.

Meanwhile Ukraine intelligence officials have warned that Russia is stockpiling the bodies of dead soldiers to stage a false flag attack at Chernobyl, releasing radioactive waste in a 'man-made catastrophe' that would amount to a 'terrorist attack'.

Ex-NATO chief Gottemoeller told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I think frankly, the Russians threw at Kyiv some of their most elite forces to begin with, they were hoping for a lightning strike to basically assassinate President Zelensky, take out the Government in Kyiv and have a quick victory.

'But it didn't work out that way and they ended up stalling on the highway outside of Kyiv.

'Now we've seen those forces disperse and disperse into the woods but I'm wondering frankly if they have the ability to regroup at this point because their logistics are in such bad shape, they don't really have the fuel supplies they need for a push on to Kyiv.

'So at the moment, I have to tell you that I'm rather sceptical that they will gain much success in an assault on Kyiv, at least with those forces.'

Meanwhile Ukraine's youngest ever MP and a former adviser to Zelensky says Kyiv could be Russia's new Stalingrad.

The bloodiest battle of World War II was a major turning point, costing the German army a quarter of everything it possessed by way of material - guns, tanks and munitions.

Sviatoslav Yurah said: 'It's a massive town of millions and if the Russians try to come in they will have quite a fight on their hands - this will be their Stalingrad if they want to make it so.

'Nobody is going to surrender - I can definitely guarantee you that.'

Air raid sirens are continuing to ring out across the capital region and artillery barrages sent residents scurrying for shelter.

Fighting erupted in multiple areas around Kyiv last night and artillery pounded its outskirts.

To the city's southwest, two columns of smoke - one black and one white - rose in the town of Vaslkyiv after a strike on an ammunition depot.

The strike on the depot caused hundreds of small explosions from detonating ammunition.

In a multi-front attack on the capital, the Russians' push from the north east appeared to be advancing, a US officials said.

The UK's Ministry of Defence said fighting north west of Kyiv has continued with the bulk of Russian ground forces now around 15 miles from the centre of the city.

A daily intelligence update said elements of the large Russian military column north of Kyiv have dispersed.

It said this is likely to support a Russian attempt to encircle the capital, and could also be an attempt by Russia to reduce its vulnerability to Ukrainian counter attacks, which have taken a significant toll on Russian forces.

New commercial satellite images appeared to capture artillery firing on residential areas that stood between the Russians and the capital.

The images from Maxar Technologies showed muzzle flashes and smoke from big guns, as well as impact craters and burning homes in the town of Moschun, 20 miles from Kyiv, the company said.

Military experts say they are baffled by the ineptitude of the tactics displayed by Russia's armies after drone footage showed a column of tanks getting picked off one-by-one in an ambush carried out by Ukraine's forces.

Analysts have said Russian tank commanders allowed the Ukrainians to ambush their unit by driving down the middle of a main road leading into Kyiv - and straight into a death trap.

By multiple counts, President Vladimir Putin's forces have lost more tanks than are operational in the entire German army.

Meanwhile in besieged Mariupol, which has endured two weeks without food, power or water amid a brutal blockade, is facing continuing shelling as a mosque housing 80 civilians including children was targeted today, and barrages have thwarted attempts to bring supplies to the strategic port city.

A cancer hospital in Mykolaiv was also hit with hundreds of patients inside undergoing chemotherapy but no one was killed in the latest monstrous attack which comes after a maternity hospital and care home were destroyed.

A ceasefire should be in place today to allow trapped residents in Mariupol, Kyiv and Sumy evacuate through humanitarian corridors, but Russia has repeatedly failed to observe them, as Ukrainian officials pleaded with Russian forces to allow the citizens to escape.

Meanwhile Zelensky slammed Moscow for 'torturing' civilians who have spent more than a week without vital supplies in besieged cities.

The Ukrainian premier accused Russia of refusing to allow evacuees to escape the city of Mariupol, which has been cut off from food, water and electricity, and defiantly insisted vital supplies would be delivered there tomorrow despite it being surrounded by Russian troops.

The Kremlin-owned Tass news agency painted a damning picture for those stuck in the city after quoting Russian Colonel Mikhail Mizintsev as saying all bridge into the city were destroyed and roads had been laid with mines.

'Russian troops have not let our aid into the city and continue to torture our people... tomorrow [Saturday] we will try again, try again to send food, water and medicine' Zelenskiy said.

Ukrainian officials revealed on Friday that Russian soldiers had kidnapped Melitopol's mayor Ivan Fedorov from the city's crisis centre after he 'refused to co-operate with the enemy'.

'This is obviously a sign of weakness of the invaders... They have moved to a new stage of terror in which they are trying to physically eliminate representatives of legitimate local Ukrainian authorities,' President Zelensky said.

'The capture of the mayor of Melitopol is therefore a crime, not only against a particular person, against a particular community, and not only against Ukraine. It is a crime against democracy itself... The acts of the Russian invaders will be regarded like those of Islamic State terrorists,' he said.

Today, Zelensky compared the kidnappers to ISIS terrorists as he appealed for help from world leaders to free him.

'They have transitioned into a new stage of terror, in which they try to physically liquidate representatives of Ukraine's lawful local authorities,' Zelenskyy said in a video address Friday evening.

Kirill Timoshenko, the deputy head of Ukraine's presidential office, posted a video on the social media site Telegram which he said showed a group of armed men carrying Fedorov across a square.

Zelensky says he understands the mayor is alive but is being tortured in Russian captivity.

In hellish scenes not witnessed on the continent since the Second World War, residents of Mariupol have resorted to fighting one another for food and bodies are buried in mass graves as more than 1,500 people have now died in the city.

Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, tweeted: 'Besieged Mariupol is now the worst humanitarian catastrophe on the planet. 1,582 dead civilians in 12 days, even buried in mass graves. Unable to defeat the Ukrainian army, Putin bombs the unarmed, blocks humanitarian aid. We need planes to stop Russian war crimes!'

What happened at the Battle of Stalingrad? The battle for Stalingrad was the turning point of the Second World War. After the German invasion of Russia — codenamed Operation Barbarossa, which began in June 1941 — the Wehrmacht continued to head eastward, destroying whole Soviet armies and capturing two million prisoners, most of whom they starved to death. In Washington and London, leaders wondered gloomily how long the Russians could stave off absolute defeat. In the spring of 1942, Hitler's legions drove deeper into the Russian heartland, besieging St Petersburg, over-running the Crimea, and threatening the oilfields of the Caucasus. The Fuhrer was convinced the Russians were at their last gasp. He was exultant when in June 'Operation Blue' enabled his armies to occupy new swathes of central Russia. Scenting final victory, Hitler deputed General Friedrich Paulus, a staff officer eager to prove himself as a fighting commander, to lead a dash for the city on the Volga that was named after Stalin, and secure a symbolic triumph, while another German army group swung southwards to grab the oilfields. Hitler's top soldiers were appalled by the perils of splitting the Wehrmacht merely to capture Stalingrad, which was strategically unimportant. Their protests were ignored: the Fuhrer insisted. Likewise in Moscow, when the German objective became plain, Russia's dictator Josef Stalin gave the order that 'his' city must be held at any cost. Thus the stage was set for one of history's most terrible clashes of arms, in which on the two sides more than a million men became locked in strife between the autumn of 1942 and the following spring. On September 12, the first German troops entered Stalingrad. From the Kremlin came a new order to the Red Army: 'Not a step back . . . The only extenuating circumstance is death.' The first German air attacks killed between 10,000 and 40,000 people — almost as many as died in the entire London blitz. Shellfire and bombs rained down on the city, day after day and week upon week. Stuka pilot Herbert Pabst wrote: 'It is incomprehensible to me how people can continue to live in that hell, but the Russians are firmly established in the wreckage, in ravines, cellars, and in a chaos of twisted skeletons of factories'. General Vasily Chuikov, commanding Stalin's 62nd Army in the city, wrote: 'The streets of the city are dead. There is not a single green twig on the trees; everything has perished in the flames.' The Russians initially held a perimeter 30 miles by 18, which shrank relentlessly as Paulus's men thrust forward to within a few hundred yards of the Volga. Each night, up to three thousand Russian wounded were ferried eastward from the city, while a matching stream of reinforcements, ammunition and supplies reached the defenders. New units were thrust into the battle as fast as they arrived, to join duels in the ruins that often became hand-to-hand death grapples. Both sides were chronically short of food and water. The few surviving civilians suffered terribly, eking a troglodyte existence in cellars. Some soldiers were reduced to cannibalism in order to stay alive in the ruins of the city as the mercury plunged to -40C. The bloodiest battle in Second World War came to an end on January 31, 1943 when Field Marshall Paulus surrendered, disobeying the orders of his Fuhrer to kill himself. Of the 110,000 Germans who surrendered, only 5,000 would survive Stalin's gulags to return to a defeated Germany. The battle cost the German army a quarter of everything it possessed by way of material - guns, tanks and munitions. It was a defeat from which it never recovered and for days afterwards in Berlin all shops and restaurants were closed as a mark of respect. Advertisement

A total of 7,144 people escaped four Ukrainian cities on Friday using humanitarian corridors, President Zelensky said in a televised address, a sharply lower number than managed to leave in each of the two previous days.

It comes as Putin struck areas in central and western Ukraine, some hundreds of miles from the capital Kyiv and huge explosions illuminated the night sky in Dnipro and Lutsk as residents experienced Russian artillery attacks for the first time.

In Ivano-Frankivsk, a triple strike hit at first light, said to be targeting an airfield on the edge of the city. Indiscriminate shelling at 4am UK time yesterday left tower blocks and a factory ablaze in Dnipro, killing a security guard.

As there were no Ukrainian military facilities in the Dnipro district, the local prosecutor opened an investigation into a possible war crime.

Residents and shop owners worked thoughout the day to clear up broken glass and board up the open window frames as snow fell and temperatures dipped below zero.

Svetlana Kalenecheko, who works in a clinic next door to the factory in Dnipro, said: 'We heard a loud explosion and the windows broke and bits of the ceiling started to fall.'

Dnipro had been considered a safe haven. Consequently, it has become a hub for the coordination of humanitarian aid and for those fleeing more severe fighting.

It was unclear last night what Putin thought he would achieve by bombing the city, as no invading troops were on the ground there yesterday. Other soft targets were hit, perhaps with the intention of spreading fear in areas previously unaffected by the invasion.

A psychiatric hospital in the eastern town of Izyum was bombed, causing 73 patients to be evacuated. Governor Oleg Sinegubov said the number of casualties was being established. He described it as 'a brutal attack on civilians'.

A care home for the disabled was also struck in the village of Oskil, eastern Ukraine. There were 330 people inside including ten who required wheelchairs and 50 with reduced mobility – but there were no casualties.

Ukrainian airstrips were targeted yesterday at Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk, which are 260 miles and 380 miles respectively from Kyiv.

Last night it was considered unlikely that attacks on airstrips so far from the capital city would provide Russian forces with a much-needed impetus.

Western officials said the invaders were making 'minimal ground' because of logistical issues and 'strong Ukrainian resistance'.

One said: 'Because of the challenges... they are reassessing how to prosecute military operations. Russia made assumptions [before the invasion] which led to tactical errors about moving forces and protecting forces.'

The failure to establish control of Kyiv could force Putin to negotiate a settlement sooner than expected.

Yesterday he said there had been 'positive changes' from the talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials as he welcomed Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko to Moscow.

It comes as Kyiv volunteers were seen digging trenches in the city outskirts to try to stop Russian troops.

Bracing themselves for a bloody fight, others joined soldiers in erecting makeshift barricades with old tyres and sandbags.

Around half of the city's 3.5million residents are thought to have fled but Mr Klitschko and his brother Wladimir – both former heavyweight boxing champions – said many were returning to defend their country.

Some Russian units are now just nine miles from the city.

There are fears they will attempt to repeat the barbaric tactics used on other cities including Mariupol, which is surrounded – with those inside suffering starvation and dehydration. Russian forces even bombed a maternity hospital there this week.

A convoy advancing through Brovary, a north-eastern suburb of Kyiv, was forced to retreat on Thursday after it became stuck in the town's streets and was ambushed by Ukrainian troops with anti-tank missiles.

At least two vehicles including a tank were destroyed and a Russian commanding officer, said to be Colonel Andrei Zakharov, an associate of Vladimir Putin, was killed.

Despite the setback, Russian forces continued to advance yesterday with armoured units seen in towns near the Antonov airport north of the city as well as in nearby forests.

The Ministry of Defence warned that Russia was looking to 'reset and reposture' its forces for 'renewed offensive activity'. But officials noted the troops had made limited progress.

'Logistical issues that have hampered the Russian advance persist, as does strong Ukrainian resistance,' a spokesman said. 'Russia is [probably] seeking to reset and reposture its forces for renewed offensive activity in the coming days. This will probably include operations against the capital Kyiv.'

Third Russian general 'killed' in Ukraine in eight days: Commander of armoured unit is the latest senior officer to be claimed dead by Ukrainian forces A third Russian general has been killed in Ukraine in just eight days in another devastating blow to Vladimir Putin's savage invasion of Ukraine. Major General Andrei Kolesnikov of the 29th Combined Arms Army became the latest high profile casualty of the war, Ukraine's government announced. There are believed to be 20 Russian generals taking part in the faltering invasion, which has also seen the loss of 173 tanks, 12 aircraft and 345 troop carriers. Western officials said the multiple general casualties suggest they are having to move to the front because Russia's troops are either unable to make their own decisions or are fearful of moving forward. Maj Gen Andrei Kolesnikov of the 29th Combined Arms Army became the latest high profile casualty of the war in another blow to the Kremlin, Ukraine's government announced Kolesnikov's death comes four days after the killing of Major General Vitaly Gerasimov, 45, the first deputy commander of Russia's 41st army. The general took part in the second Chechen war, the Russian military operation in Syria, and the annexation of Crimea, winning medals from those campaigns. According to reports, Gerasimov was the son of Valery Gerasimov - the Chief of General Staff of Russia's armed forces. And last week, Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky, 47, deputy commander of the 41st Combined Arms Army of the Central Military District, was killed. Sukhovetsky died during a special operation in Ukraine, his comrade-in-arms Sergey Chipilev wrote on social media. He was shot and killed by a sniper near Mariupol, which has been under a brutal siege by Russian forces for days. Experts have said they are baffled by the ineptitude of the tactics employed by Russia's armies after drone footage yesterday showed a column of tanks getting picked off one-by-one in an ambush by Ukraine's forces. Analysts have said Russian tank commanders allowed the Ukrainians to gun down their unit by driving down the middle of a main road leading into Kyiv - and straight into a death trap. Putin's forces have now lost more tanks than are operational in entire German army. Ukraine's masterful ambush in Brovary piled on the misery of Moscow's invading forces, which has suffered more losses than expected and are now facing freezing temperatures in the coming days. Morale is said to be low. While reports said Russia's 6th tank regiment escaped with relatively minimal casualties, Russian commander Colonel Andrei Zakharov was reportedly killed, and his unit forced into a retreat. The smouldering wrecks of Russian tanks lay on streets after the fighting. Defence experts have been left stunned by Russia's military tactics. Franz-Stefan Gady - an analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies - said the 'fight shows the danger of not securing urban terrain with adequate infantry plus recon. assets when main elements of a force pass through urban terrain ideally suitable for ambushes.' Rob Lee, a Senior Fellow and military expert at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, commented on the ambush, saying the Russian armoured force displayed 'very poor tactics'. The Russian column was 'on an obvious avenue of approach, and they still decided to bunch up like this, leaving them more vulnerable to indirect fire,' he wrote on Twitter, while sharing drone footage of the strikes. Of the Russian military activities in Ukraine, a former British army commander told The Daily Telegraph: 'This is not the Russian army we trained to fight'. It comes as Russia continued their barbaric assault by blowing up a disabled care home near the city of Kharkiv, Ukrainian officials have said, just 48 hours after shelling women as they gave birth in a maternity hospital Advertisement

Troops are approaching the capital from the north west and the east, engaging in firefights with Ukrainian soldiers in Kukhari – 56 miles from Kyiv – and Demydiv, 25 miles away.

The convoy initially stalled as it approached Kyiv amid reports of fuel and food shortages as well as resistance from the Ukrainian forces.

Speaking yesterday, Mayor Klitschko said his city had enough supplies to last a couple of weeks and had access to electricity, heating and gas.

Wladimir, who has enlisted in Ukraine's reserve army, said citizens were prepared to engage in battle. 'There are a lot of refugees who left west, but a lot are coming back,' he added.

'A lot of men and women ... coming back to defend the country. This is our home. We are staying here. We are not going anywhere.'

At least 564 civilians have died in Ukraine since Russia invaded on February 24. Ukraine's human rights ombudsman Lyudmyla Denisova said at least 78 children were among the dead.

Defence specialists have repeatedly been stunned by Russia's 'bizarre' military tactics.

Franz-Stefan Gady - an analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies - said the 'fight shows the danger of not securing urban terrain with adequate infantry plus recon. assets when main elements of a force pass through urban terrain ideally suitable for ambushes.'

Rob Lee, a Senior Fellow and military expert at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, commented on the ambush, saying the Russian armoured force displayed 'very poor tactics'.

The Russian column was 'on an obvious avenue of approach, and they still decided to bunch up like this, leaving them more vulnerable to indirect fire,' he wrote on Twitter, while sharing drone footage of the strikes.

Of the Russian military activities in Ukraine, a former British army commander told The Daily Telegraph: 'This is not the Russian army we trained to fight'.

Meanwhile, analysis by the Austrian military's R&D department demonstrated the column was part of a larger Russian Battle Tactical Group (BTG).

The analysis highlighted different companies within the BTG seen in the drone footage, as it came under Ukrainian heavy artillery guided by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).

The full scale of losses suffered by Putin's armies are unknown, but Ukraine has claimed it has destroyed over 12,000 troops, 350 tanks, 80 helicopters, 125 artillery units, 1,150 personnel carriers and almost 60 planes.

Figures based on visual confirmations by military tracking website Oryx suggest over 1,000 Russian vehicles have been destroyed, damaged, abandoned or captured in the war.

According to Oryx's figures as of March 11, Russia has lost 1,034 vehicles, of which 424 were destroyed, 13 were damaged, 159 were abandoned by Russian troops and 438 were captured by Ukraine's forces.

While there is some discrepancy between figures detailing visually confirmed Russian vehicle losses released by Oryx and those released by Ukraine's defence officials, both paint a grim picture for Moscow's armies.

Oryx says its figures are based on 'photo or videographic evidence. Therefore, the amount of equipment destroyed is significantly higher than recorded here.'

Tobias Schneider, a research fellow at the Global Public Policy Institute in Berlin, said Russian losses visually confirmed by Oryx 'now amount to approximately one Bundeswehr' - the entire German army.

According to figures released by Germany, the country currently has 159 operational tanks in its entire military.

The drone footage posted online on Thursday captured the 'Battle of Brovary', named after the north-eastern Kyiv suburb in which it took place.

It showed explosions around the Russian tanks as they passed through the village of Skybyn, releasing plumes of black and grey smoke into the air, with suburban houses seen on either side of the road.

The column was shown in the footage driving down a main road into the Brovary suburb in a long line when it came under fire from artillery.

Explosion were seen both on the road and in the fields in the distance.

Two tanks were shown pulled up on the side of the road, while others further into the suburb were shown bunched together in a traffic jam, as artillery fire began to rain down from above.

Amongst the tanks, Russian troops can be seen frantically running between the vehicles, which start to turn around to escape the death trap.

Yesterday smouldering shells of Moscow's machinery sat abandoned by the road, after the survivors of the attack performed desperate U-turns to flee the deadly corridor and retreated back up the road.

In video released by Ukraine's military, a Russian soldier could be heard saying: 'Commander, the commander's dead!'. The second voice asked for the message to be repeated – to which the first voice shouted: 'He's dead! The commander's dead!'.

Ukraine's Ministry of Defence named the dead Russian commander as Colonel Andrei Zakharov, of the 6th Tank Regiment of the 90th Tank Division, whom its statement describes as having been 'liquidated'.

In 2016, he was awarded the Order of Courage by Vladimir Putin, and the two stood shoulder-to-shoulder in photographs.

Zakharov's death, which could not immediately be verified, is another blow for Putin, as it follows those of Major General Vitaly Gerasimov, chief of staff of Russia's 41st Army, reportedly killed in fighting in Kharkiv on Monday, and Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky, the 41st Army's deputy commander, who perished early in the invasion.

'Medieval horrors' of Mariupol siege: Death toll passes 1,500 as deputy mayor says besieged Ukrainian port city is 'totally destroyed' by Russian shelling in hellish scenes

By Glen Keogh for the Daily Mail

The crisis in Mariupol deepened yet further last night as the death toll passed 1,500 and the deputy mayor claimed his besieged city had been 'totally destroyed'.

In hellish scenes not witnessed on European soil since the Second World War, residents have resorted to fighting one another for food while bodies are being buried in trenches before they pile high in the streets.

With Russia laying ruthless siege to the city, thousands of its inhabitants remained without food, water, electricity or heat as relentless shelling continued to blast shops and residential apartments.

Such is their desperation, many trapped residents have resorted to looting to provide for their families.

Unable to defeat the Ukrainian army, Putin bombs the unarmed, blocks humanitarian aid. We need planes to stop Russian war crimes!'

With temperatures dropping to -9C (15.8F), those who did not manage to escape before Russian troops encircled the perimeter run the risk of dying from thirst, starvation and the cold.

Mariupol has been a Russian target because of its port and strategic location on the Sea of Azov.

Last night all bridges and approaches to the city, in southern Ukraine, had been surrounded or destroyed.

Eight trucks carrying humanitarian aid poised to enter are thought to have been stopped.

Stephen Cornish, from medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres, said: 'Sieges are a medieval practice that have been outlawed by the modern rules of war for good reason.'

Sergei Orlov, Mariupol's deputy mayor, said there was 'no way out.' He told Irish broadcaster RTE: 'Russian troops do not allow us to leave our cities. We have no utilities, no electricity, no sanitary system.

'Without water we had the awful [situation] when a child died of dehydration. So people collect snow to melt it to water.

The city is totally destroyed by artillery and... aircraft bombing.' Mr Orlov said 50,000 children including 3,000 babies and toddlers remain in Mariupol.

He estimated that about 100,000 of its 450,000 citizens had managed to flee before the siege. He added: 'Unfortunately, we have no opportunity to bury [the dead] in private graves. That's why yesterday we buried 47 people in a mass grave.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10605505/Kyiv-Putins-Stalingrad-Russias-assault-capital-doomed-fail-officials-say.html

As a university lecturer, I have been conducting classes online with students for about two weeks with roughly 70% being present. We are trying not to fall into the barbarism that the war and Russia brought, and therefore we must learn. By now, students are used to reacting quickly and changing habits quickly. I learned a lot of new things: where it is better to hide, how to provide first aid, etc. We closely monitor politics, we support the authorities in everything, but not blind support. Therefore, in social networks we express dissatisfaction with the terms of negotiations with Russia. The city changes daily. At first, there were few people on the streets because some left. Now there are more refugees from more dangerous areas are coming here. We buy only the necessary things: food and medicines. We don’t think about anything else. On the streets of the city there are people only during the day, in the evening the city freezes, there is practically no light, only a little from the windows. Everyone is trying not to go out in the evening. From 9 p.m. to 6 a.m., a curfew continues and it is impossible to go outside.‎ (April 4th, 2022)

Mikhail Alexseev (San Diego, CA): It would be good to learn more about ordinary people’s lives in areas recently seized by Russian forces (such as Kherson and Melitopol); also, evidence in settlements recently reclaimed by Ukraine indicate evidence of summary executions of civilians; and little is known from the mainstream media coverage here about the impact on people in the occupied territories of DNR/LNR in the Donbas and on those used as decoy refugees back in February as part of the false flag op to justify the invasion.

We are talking about a huge number of people. The minimum number mentioned is 6,5 mln, but this is possible a serious undercount. Uprooted people, leaving everything behind, most often with a job, so no means to earn means to provide for themselves and families. Have to spend funds on housing and food.
