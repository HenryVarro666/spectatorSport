It also said the Ukrainian forces are likely to push the Russian troops further away from Kyiv, towards the Hostomel Airfield, adding that in the country‚Äôs south, too, the Russians are facing stiff resistance.

‚ÄúIn the south, Russian forces are still attempting to circumvent Mykolaiv as they look to drive west towards Odesa with their progress being slowed by logistic issues and Ukrainian resistance,‚Äù the UK said.

The development, if true, comes as a further setback to Russia which, despite its numerical advantage and technological edge, has, thus far, failed to capture Kyiv. It also comes just days after Ukrainian soldiers guarding the capital pushed Russian soldiers out of Makariv, a suburb in the city.

Meanwhile, on Thursday, US President Joe Biden arrived in Brussels, Belgium, where he attended an emergency summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and met fellow government heads from the G7 nations, to discuss the crisis. On Friday, Biden will travel to Poland to meet his Polish counterpart Andrzej Duda to hold talks on the conflict.

In the United States, Biden's warnings that democracy is under siege from menacing autocrats can seem remote, even after former President Donald Trump's US Capitol insurrection and attempt to steal the 2020 election.

But in Poland, which neighbors Ukraine, freedom is fresh enough to still be a novelty. In a tortured 20th-century history, the country ‚Äî torn between East and West ‚Äî was repeatedly conquered, was ruled by foreign tyrants and saw millions of its people purged or driven as refugees from homes destroyed by warfare.

Poland again finds itself on the front line of conflict. It's on the dividing line between states in the NATO club, to which it now belongs, and President Vladimir Putin's Russian orbit, which includes another Polish neighbor, Belarus. Poland has opened its borders to more than 2 million of the nearly 3.7 million Ukrainians who have fled Putin's onslaught, and the war came close to its borders with a Russian strike on a base in western Ukraine earlier this month.

Like Ukraine, Poland lived for decades under Moscow's Communist iron fist. Like Ukrainians, Poles are often gritty, are deeply suspicious of Russians and have fighting for their freedom and sovereignty ingrained in their DNA. Unlike Ukraine, one of the founding republics of the Soviet Union, Poland made it to the West after decades under the Warsaw Pact umbrella. And in addition to being in NATO, it's a member of the European Union, albeit one that has had tensions recently with Brussels over its own flirtations with populist nationalism.

As Putin's threat mounted in recent years, Poland hosted rotations of US troops and jets. In February, before Putin invaded Ukraine, Poland was one of the nations to which Biden ordered 3,000 troops to bolster the alliance's eastern flank. If the war in Ukraine spills over into a broader conflict between Russia and the West, a frightening prospect, there's a good chance it could happen in Poland.

Russian forces are losing ground in Ukraine, allowing the country's own forces to reclaim certain key towns and positions just 20 miles from Kyiv, according to the UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD).

Ukrainian counter-attacks and issues with Russian supply lines are both allowing Ukraine to retake towns and defensive positions up to 21 miles (35km) east of Kyiv, the MoD said in an intelligence update.

After invading Ukraine a month ago, Russia has so far failed to capture a single major city.

Despite warnings that the war could see a quick Russian victory, its armoured columns are moving much slower than expected, with forces taking heavy casualties and running low on supplies.

The MoD shared its latest intelligence update on Twitter. (Twitter/MoD)

In its intelligence update posted on Twitter on Friday (25 March), the MoD said: ""Ukrainian counter-attacks, and Russian forces falling back on overextended supply lines, has allowed Ukraine to reoccupy towns and defensive positions up to 35 kilometres east of Kyiv.

""Ukrainian forces are likely to continue to attempt to push Russian forces back along the north-western axis from Kyiv towards Hostomel Airfield.

""In the south of Ukraine, Russian forces are still attempting to circumvent Mykolaiv as they look to drive west towards Odesa, with their progress being slowed by logistic issues and Ukrainian resistance.""

Russian President Vladimir Putin has continued to claim the invasion is going to plan, but as well as unflinching opposition from Ukrainian forces, he is also said to face issues on home turf, with widespread protests in Russian cities and the risk of being ousted in a coup led by his own security services.

A month into their assault, Russian troops have failed to capture a major Ukrainian city. An offensive that Western countries believe was aimed at swiftly toppling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's government has been halted at the gates of Kyiv. Battlelines there have been frozen for weeks with Russian columns threatening Kyiv from the northwest and the east. But in an intelligence update on Friday, Britain described a Ukrainian counteroffensive that had pushed the Russians far back.

Ukrainian counterattacks and Russian forces falling back on overextended supply lines have allowed Ukraine to reoccupy towns and defensive positions up to 35 kilometers (21 miles) east of Kyiv, the update said. It noted that Ukrainian forces were also likely to try to push the Russians back on the other main axis threatening Kyiv from the northwest, while in the south, Russia could still be planning to attack the port of Odessa after abandoning efforts to take Mykolaiv.

The Ukrainian military said its troops were repelling Russian forces trying to fight their way into Kyiv. Troops were also still holding on to the city of Chernihiv, northeast of Kyiv, hindering a Russian advance in the direction of the capital.

Russia said Friday it had destroyed the largest remaining military fuel storage site in Ukraine, attacking it with Kalibr cruise missiles.

""On the evening of March 24, Kalibr high-precision sea-based cruise missiles attacked a fuel base in the village of Kalynivka near Kyiv,"" the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement, adding that it was Ukraine's largest remaining military fuel storage facility, supplying troops in the central part of the pro-Western country.

Since the start of Moscow's military action in Ukraine, Russian troops have destroyed more than 260 drones, over 1,580 tanks and other armored vehicles, and 204 anti-aircraft weapons systems, the ministry said. While Ukrainian forces have stalled the initial Russian invasion and even launched some successful counterattacks, there are early signs that both sides are digging in for a long and bloody war that neither can easily win.

Moscow calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"" to disarm its neighbor. Kyiv and its Western allies call it an unprovoked war of aggression and say Russia's true aim was to overthrow the government of what President Vladimir Putin regards as an illegitimate state.

Russians have begun to flee from Hostomel, a Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovich said.

‚ÄúThey have already begun to depart from Hostomel. We saw the first ones today. They throw equipment, some of them change into civilian clothes, some just leave,‚Äù he said.

Unable to capture Ukrainian cities, Russia has resorted to pounding them with artillery and airstrikes. The eastern port of Mariupol has been under siege since the war's early days. Tens of thousands of people are still believed to be trapped inside with no access to food, medicine, power or heat. In a part of the city now captured by the Russians, one woman waiting in line to receive food supplies told Reuters her diabetic husband had slipped into a coma and died. He was buried in a flowerbed.

""We are planning on leaving but it's very difficult at the moment,"" the woman, who gave her name as Alexandra, said. ""I can't leave my husband in a flowerbed ... And then we have nowhere to go.""

About 20,000 people have answered appeals to flee the Ukrainian city of Boryspil, which is near an international airport, Boryspil Mayor Volodymyr Borysenko said on national television on Friday. He urged others to evacuate, saying the large number of civilians in villages nearby made it difficult for Ukrainian troops to clear Russian forces from the area. Boryspil International Airport is about 30 kilometers east of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.

Ukraine hoped Friday to make it possible for some civilians who have been trapped in the besieged city of Mariupol to leave in private cars, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. Repeated attempts to arrange safe passage out of the southern port city, which is surrounded by Russian forces, have failed.

Mariupol, which is normally home to about 400,000 people, has been under heavy bombardment for weeks. Civilians trapped there have been sheltering in basements with little food, power or running water.

Those who manage to leave Mariupol will find buses awaiting in the nearby city of Berdyansk which will take them to the city of Zaporizhzhia, Vereshchuk said.

""We will do everything in our power so that buses filled with Mariupol residents reach Zaporizhzhia today,"" she said.

Ukrainian officials in Mariupol said Friday they feared 300 people could have died in last week's Russian strike on a theater where hundreds were sheltering.

""From eyewitnesses, information is emerging that about 300 people died in the Drama Theatre of Mariupol following strikes by a Russian aircraft,"" Mariupol city hall wrote on Telegram.

Mariupol city hall said Friday the theater was destroyed in a ""cynical"" attack and claimed that Russia knew civilians were taking refuge in the building.

In Chernihiv, where an airstrike this week destroyed a crucial bridge, a city official, Olexander Lomako, said a ‚Äúhumanitarian catastrophe‚Äù is unfolding as Russian forces target food storage places. He said about 130,000 people are left in the besieged city, about half its prewar population.

While a number of refugees from various parts of the country continued to flock to the train station in Lviv with an aim to leave the state, a group of Ukrainian women was seen carrying arms, readying to go to the front.

Ukraine and Russia exchanged a total of 50 military and civilian prisoners, the largest swap reported yet, Vereshchuk said.

Russian forces fired two missiles late Thursday at a Ukrainian military unit on the outskirts of Dnipro, the fourth-largest city in the country, the regional emergency services said. The strikes destroyed buildings and set off two fires, it said. The number of dead and wounded was unclear.

On the same day, Ukraine accused Moscow of forcibly removing hundreds of thousands of civilians from shattered Ukrainian cities to Russia to pressure Kyiv to give up, while Zelenskyy urged his country to keep up its military defense and not stop ‚Äúeven for a minute.‚Äù

Lyudmyla Denisova, Ukraine‚Äôs ombudsperson, said 402,000 people, including 84,000 children, had been taken against their will into Russia, where some may be used as ‚Äúhostages‚Äù to pressure Kyiv to surrender.

The Kremlin gave nearly identical numbers for those who have been relocated but said they were from the predominantly Russian-speaking regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine and wanted to go to Russia. Pro-Moscow separatists have been fighting for control for nearly eight years in those regions, where many people have supported close ties to Russia.

The Ukrainian Navy said it sank a large Russian landing ship near the port city of Berdyansk that had been used to bring in armored vehicles. Russia claimed to have taken the eastern town of Izyum after fierce fighting.

Zelenskyy used his nightly video address to rally Ukrainians to ‚Äúmove toward peace, move forward.‚Äù

‚ÄúWith every day of our defense, we are getting closer to the peace that we need so much ... We can‚Äôt stop even for a minute, for every minute determines our fate, our future, whether we will live.‚Äù

He said thousands of people, including 128 children, have died in the first month of the war. Across the country, 230 schools and 155 kindergartens have been destroyed. Cities and villages ‚Äúlie in ashes,‚Äù he said.

U.S. President Joe Biden meanwhile was due to visit Poland for a firsthand look at the refugee crisis in which nearly a quarter of Ukraine's 44 million people have been uprooted and more than 3.6 million have fled to neighboring states since the Russian invasion on Feb. 24. The West has ruled out intervening on the ground or answering Ukraine's plea for a no-fly zone but has supported Kyiv with hundreds of anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons that have blasted Russian armored columns and prevented Moscow from taking control of the air.

Biden, in Europe for the series of high-level meetings, gave assurances that more aid was on the way, though it appeared unlikely the West would give Zelenskyy everything he wanted, for fear of triggering a much wider war.",https://www.dailysabah.com/world/europe/ukrainian-counterattacks-push-russian-army-east-of-kyiv

Ukrainian troops launched a series of counter-attacks which forced back over-stretched and under-supplied Russian troops, just outside the capital of Kyiv.

The Ministry of Defence announced the successful manoeuvres in an intelligence update this morning.

Kyiv‚Äôs troops had managed to not only push back the Russian invaders, but reoccupy towns and defensive positions up to 21 miles east of the city that has long been Russia ‚Äôs main target.

Since the invasion began over a month ago, it was reported that the Kremlin initially thought they could achieve a ‚Äòlightning invasion‚Äô that would see them sweep the city, and Ukrainian capital, in a matter of days.

However, instead of deposing Volodymyr Zelensky ‚Äôs government, Moscow now finds itself negotiating with it.

In the latest intelligence update, posted on Twitter, the MoD highlighted specific Russian failings - a common theme of this invasion.

The Russian troops had overextended their supply lines it said, which left it vulnerable.

This has reportedly been an issue previously as Russia expected fighting to last days, and was unprepared for the prolonged conflict it now finds itself in.

From here, the MoD said it was likely that Ukraine ‚Äôs troops would continue to push onwards, including towards the strategically significant Hosomel Airfield - where there was fierce fighting at the beginning of the invasion.

""Ukrainian forces are likely to continue to attempt to push Russian forces back along the north-western axis from Kyiv towards Hostomel Airfield.‚Äù

However, in the south of the country, Mykolaiv is still under heavy Russian siege and Moscow‚Äôs troops continue their efforts to surround the city.

The MoD added: ""In the south of Ukraine, Russian forces are still attempting to circumvent Mykolaiv as they look to drive west towards Odesa, with their progress being slowed by logistic issues and Ukrainian resistance.""

This all comes as fighting continues into its second month, after the invasion began on February 24.

Despite many thinking Kyiv and their troops would fall in days, fierce Ukrainian resistance has prolonged the war.

Only last night, Kyiv counter-attacks saw success targeting a landing ship and ammunition depots in the southern city of Berdyansk.

This was a part of a reported shift in tactics from Ukraine to target Russian supply chains and leave their frontline troops under-resourced.

As fighting continues there have been reports emerging of cracks appearing between Russian president Vladimir Putin and other top Kremlin officials.

His once close ally and defence minister Sergei Shoigu has not been seen in public in two weeks.

Close allies reportedly told one investigative news outlet Agentstvo that he had heart problems, and the Kremlin said yesterday he simply had a lot on his plate.

On top of that, one of Putin‚Äôs other allies, Anatoly Chubais, who gave him his first job in the Kremlin, quit his job and fled Russia in opposition to the war.",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/ukraine-counter-attack-forces-back-26552597
6,77b3b4db-4f66-42f0-81b7-2400d4c5e27c,['Jamie Dettmer'],,"Western defense officials say Ukraine has been employing agile insurgency tactics to disrupt Russia's invasion, and in the suburbs northwest and east of Kyiv, to push their adversaries back.



Hitting and ambushing Russian forces behind the contact lines with fast-moving units, often at night, has proven among its most effective field tactics and is adding to the logistical missteps the Russians still have not been able to overcome, military strategists say. They add that the tactics are also demoralizing Russian troops.



""They're doing a tremendous job,"" said Colonel John Barranco of the Atlantic Council, a New York-based think tank.

""The Ukrainians have developed a very competent military with good leadership at the lower level and they're motivated. And this is why, when I looked at the Russian forces deployed for the invasion, I thought, this doesn't seem like a well thought-out effort.""

Barranco, who oversaw the U.S. Marines' initial operations in Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks and served two tours in Iraq, said Russia miscalculated the resilience and capability of Ukrainian ground forces and the determination the Ukrainians would show in defending their territory. He said when he analyzed Russian forces arrayed along Ukraine's borders in February, before the invasion, he discounted the likelihood of a full-scale offensive.



""It seemed like the Kremlin attack plan might have been written in 2014. The Ukrainians have spent eight years building up their military and training,"" he said. Barranco credited training the Ukrainians have received since 2014 by U.S. National Guard units from California and other states in small-unit tactics for some of Ukraine's battlefield successes.





In the past 48 hours, Russian forces have struggled to maintain offensive actions northwest and east of Kyiv and have lost ground, with Ukrainian ground forces reoccupying territory they had lost, according to the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces. Ukrainians say they have now managed to encircle the Russian-occupied towns of Bucha, Irpin and the village of Hostomel northwest of Kyiv.

Earlier this week, the Ukrainians retook the strategically located village of Makariv outside Kyiv. Much of the success rests with the Ukrainians targeting Russia's already challenged supply lines.



Britain's Defense Ministry said the Ukrainians will likely continue to target logistical assets in Russian-held areas, forcing the Russians to ""prioritise the defence of their supply chain and deprive them of much needed resupply.""



British defense officials also confirmed Friday that Ukraine has reoccupied towns east of Kyiv. ""Ukrainian counter-attacks, and Russian Forces falling back on overextended supply lines, has allowed Ukraine to re-occupy towns and defensive positions up to 35 kilometers east of Kyiv,"" they said in a public intelligence update.



""In the south of Ukraine, Russian Forces are still attempting to circumvent Mykolaiv as they look to drive west toward Odesa, with their progress being slowed by logistic issues and Ukrainian resistance,"" they added.



Russian forces also appear to be preparing defensive positions around Kyiv, ready for a war of attrition. Earlier this week VOA reported that satellite imagery released by Maxar Technologies, a space technology and earth-observation company, appeared to show Russians soldiers building protective dirt berms near the villages of Ozera, Zdvyzhivka and Berestyanka, northwest of Kyiv, and around Antonov Air Base.



The berms are likely being built to guard against Ukrainian counterattacks, Western officials said.



""The Ukrainians know their territory ‚Äî they know their ground. They've thought about this for a long time, and they are outperforming the Russians at the small-unit level,"" Barranco told VOA.



He and other military analysts said the Ukrainians are using a variety of tactics to push the Russian forces onto the back foot.

Among them are setting up so-called kill boxes, or defined target areas, and then drawing their foes into them; unleashing highly focused and ferocious attacks on isolated Russian troops; creating fallback routes after ambushes as they set up a subsequent attack; and striking mechanized units when they are stalled.



Another advantage the Ukrainians are exploiting is competent leadership by noncommissioned officers (NCOs), the officials say, which is also consistent with U.S. military doctrine and training.



""The U.S. puts a lot of focus on building a professional, noncommissioned officer corps of corporals and sergeants who understand the big picture and are given the delegated authority to make decisions on the battlefield as they lead their units,"" Barranco said.



""Junior officers are also taught to work closely with professional NCOs. The Russian military has acknowledged they have a problem with poorly trained NCOs and have started an NCO academy because they realize they do not have good leadership at the lower levels,"" he added.

Ukrainian troops have struck back at the Russian advance on Kyiv, taking back towns and strategically important defensive positions which were captured by invading troops.

The Ministry of Defence says Ukrainian troops have reoccupied multiple areas up to 21 miles east of the Ukrainian capital.

In its latest intelligence update, the MoD said: ""Ukrainian counter-attacks, and Russian forces falling back on overextended supply lines, has allowed Ukraine to reoccupy towns and defensive positions up to 35 kilometres east of Kyiv.

""Ukrainian forces are likely to continue to attempt to push Russian forces back along the north-western axis from Kyiv towards Hostomel Airfield.

""In the south of Ukraine, Russian forces are still attempting to circumvent Mykolaiv as they look to drive west towards Odesa, with their progress being slowed by logistic issues and Ukrainian resistance.""

Professor Gwythian Prins, former adviser to NATO and a member of the Chief of the Defence Staff‚Äôs Strategy Advisory Panel up to 2014, told LBC today: ‚ÄúWe are at the culmination point, the high-tide moment for Russians. They have run out of energy.

‚ÄúThey have lost more people and almost as much equipment in 24 days than they lost in Afghanistan in 9 years and 9 months.‚Äù

Yesterday Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said Europe was ""a little too late"" to stop Russia's invasion, by not sanctioning Moscow and blocking the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline earlier.

In a separate development, Boris Johnson was accused by the Kremlin of being the most active 'anti-Russian' leader as he announced fresh sanctions and urged a targeting of Vladimir Putin's gold reserves.

Downing Street hit back, saying the Prime Minister was instead ""among the most active anti-Putin leaders"" as sought to rally leaders at a Nato summit in Brussels to provide more defensive military support to Ukraine.

In a virtual address to the allies on Thursday, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky pleaded for ""1% of all your planes, 1% of all your tanks"" but it appeared his demand would not be met.

Mr Johnson had instead committed a new package of 6,000 more missiles and announced sanctions against a further 65 individuals and entities.

Among those hit with travel bans and asset freezes were the Wagner Group, a Russian paramilitary organisation accused of plotting to assassinate Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky.

Speaking to broadcasters after landing in Belgium's capital, Mr Johnson said: ""We've got to tighten the economic vice around Putin, sanctioning more people today, as we are, sanctioning the Wagner Group, looking at what we can do to stop Putin using his gold reserves, and also doing more to help the Ukrainians defend themselves.""

The Foreign Office said a total of 1,000 fresh sanctions have been handed out since the invasion begun, with the new round including Russian billionaire Eugene Shvidler and Galina Danilchenko, who was installed by Moscow as the mayor of occupied Melitopol in south-east Ukraine.

Britain's response in particular appeared to be riling Mr Putin.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted by the state-owned RIA news agency as saying: ""As for Mr Johnson, we see him as the most active participant in the race to be anti-Russian.

""It will lead to a foreign policy dead end.""

The Prime Minister's official spokesman firmly denied Mr Johnson being ""anti-Russian"".

""The Prime Minister is among the most active anti-Putin leaders,"" he said.

""We have no issue with the Russian people and in fact we have seen many bravely protest - not least (jailed opposition leader) Alexei Navalny - against Putin's regime and call on them to cease this war,"" the spokesman said.

Praising him as ""one of the most extraordinary war leaders of recent times"", Mr Johnson said Mr Zelensky wants tighter sanctions on Mr Putin's regime and ""very specific defensive military support"" for his armed forces.

""And that, we're determined to provide,"" Mr Johnson said.

He also hit out at Moscow's bid to host Euro 2028, saying Russia should withdraw its forces and the football tournament should be handed to Ukraine.

""The idea of Russia holding any kind of football tournament or any kind of cultural event right now is beyond satire,"" he said.

""The best thing possible would be for the entire Russian armed forces to retire forthwith from Ukraine and to hand it to them, of course.""

However, those remarks came just a day after the UK and Ireland football associations submitted their joint formal interest in staging the tournament.

Downing Street said Mr Johnson was responding to a question about Moscow's ""brazen and sorely misjudged"" attempt to obtain a platform on the international stage by hosting the tournament.

""Clearly we remain entirely committed to the UK and Ireland bid for Euro 2028 which retains the Government's full backing,"" the Prime Minister's official spokesman said.

During his virtual address to leaders including US President Joe Biden, Mr Zelensky was understood not to have reiterated his plea for Nato to install a no-fly zone above Ukraine, following fears it would provoke a wider conflict.

A western official speaking after the summit did not rule out individual leaders providing tanks or planes as requested by the Ukrainian leader, but said ""there was no direct discussion about allies providing that sort of equipment now"".

They said leaders agreed Russia using chemical weapons in Ukraine would mark a ""fundamental change"" in the Ukrainian conflict that would be met with a ""very severe response"".

The western official said it was ""highly unlikely"" that would cause allies to send their troops to the conflict, but would not outline what the response would be, saying ""we need to keep Putin guessing.""

Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg did announce an agreement to provide assistance in the cyber-security sphere and equipment to protect against biological, chemical and nuclear threats.

Leaders also approved the deployment of new Nato battle groups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia to shore up the defence alliance's eastern flank.

Six more banks were among those being sanctioned with asset freezes and travel bans, as was one of the world's largest diamond producer Alrosa, and Polina Kovaleva, the stepdaughter of Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov.",https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/ukraine-takes-positions-kyiv-inflicts-huge-losses-russian-troops/
