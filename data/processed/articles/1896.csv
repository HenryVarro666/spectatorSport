The city is said to be 18 miles from the border of Ukraine, making it a prime target for a counter-offensive.

It’s important to note that the incident is not claimed by Ukraine and cannot be verified by SOFREP and other media outlets as war is really vulnerable to propaganda and false-flag attacks. With this being said, we’re prepared to give you any updates when more information arises.

Russian officials from Belgorod reported that a pair of Ukrainian Mi-24 Hind attack helicopters crossed into Russia and struck an oil depot and other buildings, destroying various infrastructure in the industrial center of the city. The alleged attack happened pre-dawn, with the helicopters flying at low altitudes to avoid detection by Russian radars. A video on Twitter puts the attack date at 04/01/2022 at around 5:43 AM, with the helicopters all blacked out, launching rockets to the oil facility. The oil depot was said to be owned by the Russian oil firm Rosneft.

In Russia's Belgorod, a fire broke out at an oil depot, two workers were injured – region's authorities. Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov states that the fire broke out due to an air strike from two Ukrainian helicopters. https://t.co/d3pv2Pyqic pic.twitter.com/TjeYm9rEd5 — Euromaidan Press (@EuromaidanPress) April 1, 2022

As reported by Russian state news RIA Novosti, eight tanks with a volume of 2,000 cubic meters are on fire, with the fire potentially spreading to other tanks. Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said that “The fire at the oil depot happened as a result of an airstrike of two helicopters of the Armed Forces of Ukraine that entered the territory of Russia at low altitude.” He also reported that two people were injured as a result of the attack, with their locality trying to control the fire.

If determined to be true, this would be the first major counter-offensive the Ukrainians have launched on Russian soil, which would indicate that they are very much capable of striking Russian infrastructure on their territory. It is also the riskiest move they could make as Belgorod is deep into Russian territory. More so, since the peace talks are ongoing, it could jeopardize any progress made if proven true. It is also the first strike by a manned aircraft against Russia since the Korean War.

While it is impressive if the Ukrainians really did pull off the counter-attack, this is exactly why it is completely reasonable to question the legitimacy of the counter-offensive. While the Ukrainians can launch counter-offensives against Russia, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been very vocal about settling the war and entertained the possibility of no longer joining NATO and becoming a neutral country.

“Security guarantees and neutrality, the non-nuclear status of our state. We are ready to go for it. This is the most important point,” Zelensky said during a 90-minute video call. According to him, it was Ukraine’s main goal to end the war as quickly as possible to avoid any more deaths. However, he said that the neutrality clause was only on the table if he could discuss it face-to-face with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Furthermore, it was also reported that the Russia-Ukraine peace talks have been making slow progress in Turkey, with the Russian delegation saying that they would ease (not stop) their military operations in Northern Ukraine. Though, this was later proven to be somewhat of a lie as they had bombed the city of Chernihiv a day after. Western leaders were skeptical of the announcement from the very beginning. They alleged that the Russian forces might just be taking this opportunity to resupply in Belarus and launch an offensive in Donbas to “completely liberate” it. The Kremlin claimed this to be the real goal of the so-called military operation.

It can also be the case that Russia is just using an old trick up its sleeve, using false-flag attacks to shape the narrative of the invasion as it has done with its previous operations. This would also be possible as the Russians claimed in early March that they had practically destroyed Ukraine’s Air Force, leaving a few aircraft to be used. Chief Spokesman for the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation Igor Konashenkov said that they destroyed over 2,200 military infrastructure targets in Ukraine but did not detail what was destroyed. Specifically, the Ukrainians did have around 34 units of the Mi-24 before the invasion, some of which could have survived Russian airstrikes; this, in effect, makes an attack hypothetically possible as they would have helicopters at their disposal.

If it were the case that the Ukrainians actually did launch this attack, then it does not look good on Russia as a pair of not-so-modern Mi-24s infiltrated their airspace unscathed. More so, making its way from a heavily militarized war zone to a heavily militarized area in Belgorod. Is it too good to be true that Russia’s air defense systems (both long-range and short-range) were not able to detect two Mi-24s headed their way? More so, Russians in Ukraine were also not able to determine or spot these helicopters headed for their borders too with their radars? It’s plausible, considering their communication systems in Ukraine were already malfunctioning. It may be the case that their radars might not have been working too, but this would be very unlikely. However, to the Ukrainian’s benefit, they have the experience of flying low and fast to avoid detection, as they have done these kinds of flying for years in the Donbas region.

Regardless, if determined that the Ukrainians really did launch this attack, then the Russian forces have reason to fall back (unlikely) as it may be foreshadowing what could happen to them if they anger the Ukrainians more — that underestimating the outgunned underdog was not the best decision they could make.

Was it a large success? While they did hit their targets, one oil facility destroyed does not really kill the entire war as Russia has many oil depots where it could obtain the oil. It is, however, a strategic win as Belgorod can provide the oil their military needs as it is one of the closest ones to Ukraine. It was reported by Reuters that the attack would not affect the region’s fuel supplies and prices, according to a statement by Russian Energy Minister Nikolai Shulginov.

It is also a symbolic win for the Ukrainians as well. It would be a superior boost to morale to fight more and get the Russians out of their territory. It shows that the “little guy” can fight the far larger guy in a fistfight. In simpler terms, it could give Russia a taste of its own medicine. More so, flying that deep into enemy territory shows a lot of raw guts no matter how confident you are with your skills and may just give Ukrainians a far larger morale increase against the demotivated Russian forces.

As of writing, Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for the attack. However, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said that he could neither confirm nor deny the attack on the oil depots.",https://sofrep.com/news/did-ukrainian-mi-24-attack-helicopters-really-strike-an-oil-depot-in-belgorod-russia/
1,fe0f79cd-4995-4728-b9c5-45504dfce289,['Tyler Rogoway'],2022-04-01 05:21:20,"Details are very limited at this time and are likely going to change as more information comes available, but reports indicate that a pair of Ukrainian Mi-24 Hind attack helicopters crossed low over the border into Russia early Friday morning and struck an oil storage facility in Belgorod. If these details stick, the pre-dawn strike is the riskiest direct attack on Russian interests outside Ukraine by Ukrainian forces since the war began five weeks ago — it would also seemingly be the first strike launched by manned aircraft against Russian territory since at least the Korean War.

We must add one major caveat here before we continue on. There have been countless allegations and evidence that Russia and its proxies had or were planning on staging false-flag-like events in order to shape the narrative of the conflict and provide justification for extreme military acts. There are no major indications at this time that this attack was some sort of ploy, but it is a real possibility to always keep in mind, especially considering how poorly the invasion has gone for Russia. In other words, yes, this could turn out to be a self-inflicted wound.

Early Friday morning (Ukraine local time), videos began surfacing on social media showing blacked-out Mi-24s making rocket attack runs on a large oil storage facility in Belgorod, which lies not far beyond Ukraine's northeastern border. The oil storage tanks are seen exploding and a massive fire ensuing, one that appears to be still burning at this time.

According to The Moscow Times, Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of the Belgorod region, wrote the following in a Telegram post:

""There was a fire at the petrol depot because of an airstrike carried out by two Ukrainian army helicopters, who entered Russian territory at a low altitude.""

Belgorod sits roughly just 18 miles north of the border with Ukraine, but there are a huge amount of Russian forces arrayed between there and Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, which has been under assault from Russian forces since the war began. The possible fact that lowly Mi-24s were able to infiltrate Russia in such a heavily militarized area to make such a brazen attack would be a damning indictment of Russia's air defense capabilities. That area would be especially heavily populated by layers of air defense systems, including many short-range units that are specifically designed to target and engage low-flying helicopters in any conditions.

The helicopters involved in the raid would have been Soviet-era Mi-24 Hinds, which are operated by the Ukrainian Army Aviation. These aircraft saw extensive action during the conflict in eastern Ukraine, the so-called Anti-Terrorist Operation (ATO), in 2014 and 2015, sustaining several losses in the process. Nevertheless, after this campaign was wound down, the Ukrainian Army Aviation was left with four brigades of Mi-24s, dominated by the 30mm-cannon-armed Mi-24P Hind-F version. Western analysts put the total active Ukrainian Hind fleet at 34, prior to the latest hostilities.

While the ATO was still underway, Ukraine began upgrading some of its Mi-24Ps to the Mi-24PU1 standard. As well as being fitted with uprated engines, these helicopters received the Adros KT-01AV self-protection system to defend against infrared-guided missiles, plus a new FPM-01KV laser target designator for improved firing precision at night. Additionally, the PU1 version adds a Garmin GPS navigation system and an improved radio in the cockpit. Further optimizing the new version for night operations, the crew is provided with new Polish-made THL-5NV helmets with integrated night-vision devices.

The first Mi-24PU1 was delivered in 2012 and work was still underway to upgrade further helicopters as of September last year. Clearly, the Mi-24PU1 would be an ideal candidate for this type of raid, although the precise variant that was used cannot yet be confirmed.

Ukraine has supposedly struck Russia before in its own territory, albeit with dated tactical ballistic missiles, but some of these attacks seem to have achieved significant success. Still, these operations pale in comparison to this raid and what it symbolizes.

This action could be a preview of what is to come as Russia reduces its ambitions in Ukraine after severely underestimating the country's ability to defend itself while overestimating the capabilities of its own forces. Kyiv clearly wants vengeance for the carnage Moscow has inflicted on Ukraine and its people. At the same time, there is much we don't know about how this came together and who actually ordered the strike.

Regardless, the strike could serve as a major rallying cry for all Ukrainians and is somewhat reminiscent of operations like the Doolittle Raids following Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. If it was indeed executed by Ukrainian forces, it showcases the bravery of their aircrews and represents the underdog taking the fight to the enemy just as it tries to reposition itself in order to salvage a major military operation gone wrong.

And yes, there is a real tactical benefit here. Those fuel tanks are located just where Russia is planning to focus its military might going forward. Destroying them will hinder those operations. Finally, it's would also serve as a clear response to Russia's recent campaign of going after the exact same type of facilities in western Ukraine as of late.

Update, 7.45 AM PST: The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense has declined to comment directly on allegations that its forces struck the Belgorod fuel depot earlier today. However, Col. Oleksandr Motuzyanyk said the Ukrainian Armed Forces were conducting a defensive operation and could not be held responsible for ""every catastrophe on Russia's territory.""

Meanwhile, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has said: “I can neither confirm nor reject the claim that Ukraine was involved in this simply because I do not possess all the military information.”

Update, 1.45 PM PST: In a surprising turn of events, Ukrainian Security Council Secretary Oleksiy Danilov, the country's leading security official, has denied that the Ukrainian Armed Forces were responsible for the attack on the fuel depot. Danilov said: ""For some reason, they [the Russians] say that we did it, but according to our information this does not correspond to reality.""

In the United States, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that the president was ""not in a position to comment on the Kremlin's statements,"" regarding its claims that Ukraine was responsible for whatever happened at Belgorod. The question of what exactly did occur has not become much more perplexing, especially in regard to the video footage showing two Mi-24s that seemed to be involved in launching rockets at the facility.

So far, a robust denial has come from only one Ukrainian official, strongly suggesting there is still a possibility that Ukrainian-flown helicopters were responsible. On the other hand, if what Danilov said is correct, then the incident could indeed have been some kind of false flag by Russian-operated Hinds, or even an attack prosecuted by Russian defectors. We just can't say for certain at this time. The Mi-24s involved apparently wore white identification bands, although it's also not immediately clear if these are the typical Russian or Ukrainian markings.

A case of Russian Mi-24s attacking the wrong target seems unlikely, but by the same token, it's not immediately clear why a fuel depot would be chosen for a false flag operation. A more likely target would be some more overtly civilian objective or at least one that would not also necessarily impact Russia's own war effort.

We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available.

Open-source investigators have begun probing the blast as Moscow accuses Ukraine of launching the first strike on its territory since Russia launched its invasion on 24 February.

If Ukraine is found to have carried out the attack it would be the first airstrike by a foreign power on Russian soil since the Second World War.

The attack footage clearly shows not only the helicopters flying at speed over part of Belgorod, but also the flames from missile launches, which can be seen from the ground, streaking away against the night sky.

The missiles are followed by a series of explosions and fireballs on the ground, including one that is markedly bigger than the rest, indicating the destruction of something highly inflammable.

But with claims that Moscow is preparing a flag operation to escalate the war, the grainy videos provide few clues as to who was responsible for the attack.

One video shows what could be the shape of a Mi-24, known in Russia as the ‘Crocodile’ because of its distinctive camouflage, or the ‘Drinking Glass’ because of the glass balls that surround its two cockpits. Another helicopter follows shortly afterwards, but it is less distinct.

As the helicopters slip passed, neither could be properly made out in the darkness. Nor were any identification markings visible in the footage available so far, making its attribution much harder.

One of the problems in identifying who flew the helicopters is that the Mi-24, known as ‘Hind’ to Nato forces, is used by both Russia and Ukraine.

Similarly, the rockets thought to have been used in the attack offer little certainty.

Pictures claimed to show the remains of rockets, and some experts identified them as likely to be S-8s, a type of unguided missile.

But as with the helicopters, these are a type of weapon that are used by Russian and Ukrainian forces.

Other videos show a huge pall of smoke that was still over the city that afternoon.

Russian TV channels described the location of the airstrike as Belgorod’s Rosneft oil depot, which confirms the target.

Russia’s Ministry of Emergency Situations told the Interfax news agency that nearly 200 firefighters were tackling a blaze involving eight tanks. Two workers were reported as injured and residents in nearby streets were evacuated.

Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of the region, said in a Telegram message: “The fire at the oil depot occurred as a result of an air strike from two helicopters of the armed forces of Ukraine, which entered the territory of Russia at low altitude. There are no victims.”

Whether or not anyone died in the attack remains to be confirmed by other sources, despite the governor’s statement.

Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for the air strike. There are fears Russia will launch ‘false flag’ attacks throughout the war, which it could then use as an excuse for escalation.

Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said that he could “neither confirm nor deny” Ukrainian involvement in the attack. It was unclear whether that was because he had no information to hand, or if he was unwilling to reveal his knowledge.

However, it was thought that if it were a false flag assault, Ukraine would be quick to disassociate itself from the attack.

Belgorod is about 30 miles from the Ukrainian border and even farther from Kharkiv – a risky flight across foreign territory.

Online analysts say they located the site of the explosion to an industrial park in eastern Belgorod, which is some distance away from nearby housing.

“I can neither confirm nor reject the claim that Ukraine was involved in this simply because I do not possess all the military information,” Kuleba said in response to reporters’ questions.

The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense did not respond to NBC News’ requests for comment.

NBC News could not independently verify the claim the Ukrainian armed forces were responsible. Footage verified by NBC News showed a large fire and plumes of black smoke at the oil and natural gas fuel depot in Belgorod.

The allegation, the first time Russia has accused Ukrainian forces of launching an air strike on Russian soil, follows warnings from Western powers that Moscow may stage “false flag” attacks to justify launching or escalating the conflict.

U.K.-based military analyst Joseph Dempsey analyzed videos of the alleged attack, and concluded that a Russian-made Hind variant of the Mil Mi-24 helicopter gunship was involved.

It was “unclear” whether the helicopter was operated by Ukrainian or Russian forces, added Dempsey, who is a research associate at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London-based think tank.

The munitions which appeared to have been used, particularly unguided rockets, “are primarily of Soviet origin and remain in use with both Russia and Ukraine,” he added.

Ukrainian forces are “capable of launching such an attack,” according to David Jordan, the director of the Freeman Air and Space Institute at King’s College London. “They have helicopter crews who are pretty competent and would be able to do this,” he said.

He added that without a proper assessment it was hard to work out exactly what happened, “but if the damage was pretty serious to an important part of the facility then that would more likely point to it being a Ukrainian attack.”

If it turned out the damage was minimal, he said that might point to it being a Russian false-flag operation, although he stressed it was “too early to judge.”

He added that even if it was the only operation the Ukrainians had planned, Moscow “would now have to be prepared for further attacks.”

Russia, meanwhile, showed support for ongoing peace talks with Ukraine, with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov saying during a visit to India that they “inevitably” had to continue.
