Summary Mariupol has been surrounded by Russian forces

City officials say supplies are running out

Previous attempts to arrange humanitarian corridor failed

LVIV, Ukraine, March 14 (Reuters) - A convoy of at least 160 cars left Mariupol on Monday in the first successful attempt to arrange a humanitarian corridor out of the encircled Ukrainian city after over a week of trying.

Civilians have been trapped in the southern port city by Russian shelling for more than two weeks and have been without heating, electricity and running water for most of this time, the Ukrainian authorities say.

More than 2,500 residents have been killed there since the Russian invasion on Feb. 24, a Ukrainian official said.

A local ceasefire arranged with the Russian forces besieging Mariupol held long enough for the first cars to leave for the city of Zaporizhzhia about 225 km (140 miles) away, senior Ukrainian and local officials said.

Efforts were also being made to deliver supplies to the remaining civilians after the city council said on Sunday the last reserves of food and water were running out. Russia says it does not target civilians.

""At one o'clock (1100 GMT) the Russians opened a checkpoint and those who have cars and fuel began to leave Mariupol in the direction of Zaporizhzhia,"" Andrei Rempel, a representative of the city council who is now in Zaporizhzhia, told Reuters.

""In the first two hours, 160 cars left. There are probably already many more now. The city continues to be bombed but this road is not being shelled. We don't know when the first cars can get to Zaporizhzhia as there are still many Russian checkpoints that need to be passed.""

The city council said the convoy had already passed Berdyansk, a city about 85 km from Mariupol.

Reuters was unable to verify the convoy's progress from Mariupol, a city of about 400,000 in peacetime that local officials say has been devastated by Russian shelling.

'CRITICAL' SITUATION

The city council described the situation in Mariupol on Friday as ""critical"".

Presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said on Monday that more than 2,500 residents had been killed since Feb. 24. The toll could not be independently verified by Reuters.

Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk confirmed the convoy of private cars had left Mariupol but said Russian shelling was preventing a convoy reaching the city with humanitarian supplies.

""We will now do everything we can to get our convoy to Mariupol and pick up women and children on the way back,"" she said.

Each side has blamed the other for the failure of other attempts to open humanitarian corridors. Moscow describes its actions in Ukraine as a special operation to disarm its neighbour and unseat leaders it calls neo-Nazis.

A senior official in President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's office said more than 1,700 people had also been evacuated on Monday through humanitarian corridors in the eastern region of Luhansk, although Ukrainian officials said there was Russian fire along the entire frontline.

The Take podcast: Is Russia’s Syria playbook being used in Ukraine?

What can 11 years of war in Syria tell us about Ukraine? This week marks the anniversary of Syria’s uprising and there still seems to be no end to conflict in sight.

There’s also another date that resonates: September 30, 2015, when Russia intervened on behalf of President Bashar al-Assad’s government.

Russia said it tested at least 320 new types of weapons in Syria, some of which are now in use in the war in Ukraine, and it is using tactics that seem to come from what has been called the “Syria playbook”.

We look at how the people all too familiar with that playbook see Syria’s story in Ukraine.

Ukraine’s economy could collapse if war drags on: IMF

The Russian invasion could plunge Ukraine into a devastating recession, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said.

At a minimum, the country would see “output falling 10 percent this year, assuming a prompt resolution of the war,” the IMF said.

The lender added that if the conflict is prolonged, the situation will worsen. Citing wartime data for conflicts in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen, it predicted the “annual output contraction could eventually be much higher, in the range of 25 to 35 percent.”

Russian troops focus efforts on capital Kyiv

Russian troops have refocused their efforts to seize Kyiv, firing artillery on suburbs, a local official said on Ukrainian television.

The official also said a town councillor for Brovary, east of Kyiv, had been killed in fighting there and shells fell on the towns of Irpin, Bucha and Hostomel, which have seen some of the worst conflict during Russia’s stalled attempt to take the capital.

Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan, reporting from Kyiv, said residents in the capital were in for another nervous night, after the shelling of an apartment block in the early morning hours killed at least one person.

“A lot of the residents are very worried that that [attack] may have been an opening salvo for the war for control of the capital,” Khan said. “Military analysts are suggesting it may have been a way to keep pressure on the Ukrainians even as the talks were going on.”

Erdogan says unclear whether Turkey will buy more Russian arms

Turkey’s President Tayyip Erdogan has said it is too early to comment on Turkey’s possible purchase of more Russian weapons given Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

“Under the current circumstances, it would be premature to talk about what the future shows right now. We have to see what the conditions bring,” Erdogan said, speaking in Ankara alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

NATO member Turkey was handed US sanctions in December 2020 over its purchase of Russian S-400 missile defence systems and had been criticised by Western allies over the move. Ankara has said it was forced to opt for the Russian weapons because allies did not provide arms on satisfactory terms.

Land corridor ‘links’ annexed Crimea, separatist-held Donbass regions

The deputy head of the annexed peninsula of Crimea claims that a land corridor now links the area with the separatist Donbas region in eastern Ukraine.

Russian news agency RIA Novosti quoted Georgiy Muradov as saying that Russian forces had taken control of the road from Crimea to Mariupol.

There was no confirmation from Ukraine.

According to Muradov, this could help provide people in the Donetsk region with humanitarian supplies. At the same time, Kyiv said that Russian troops blocked a convoy with aid supplies for the besieged port of Mariupol in Donetsk.

Observers assume that one of the goals of Russia’s attack on Ukraine is to establish a land corridor from the separatist areas bordering Russia in eastern Ukraine to the Crimean Peninsula. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.

“Ukrainian troops are shooting in all directions”

Our correspondent Abdel-Azim Mohammad on the fighting between between Ukrainian and Russian forces in the eastern parts of Irpin – where thousands of civilians are trapped.

“We are in the heart of Irpin city, the front line where the Ukrainian army is engaged in fierce fighting with the Russians. We tried to advance towards downtown, but it seems that the Russians made it before us.

The Ukrainian troops are shooting in all directions, saying Russian snipers are stationed on rooftops to prevent the civilians from leaving the city. Dozens of residents were seen leaving from this area as well as the eastern side of Irpin.

The Ukrainians said they managed to fend off the Russians this morning. You can see the Ukrainian army’s forefront, they are trying to force the Russians back.

To my right, also fierce exchange of gunfire. It seems the Russians are advancing from more than one direction (natural sound… firing)… heavy machine guns and anti-craft guns are fired… (natural)…. (sky) they are firing into the air. It seems like a drone is hovering above… (natural)…. In this spot, and a few minutes before we arrived, dozens of civilian residents had left the city.

They claim the Russian forces granted them only a 15-minute window to leave the area before roads are closed. Many of the residents who were stranded in the eastern suburbs of Irpin managed to leave.

The Ukrainian troops are adamant to fight to force the Russians back since thousands of civilians are still trapped in northern and eastern parts of the city.”

Russia threatens Western companies with arrests, seizures: Report

Russian authorities, facing potential economic calamity as Western sanctions take hold, have threatened foreign companies hoping to withdraw from the country with arrests and asset seizures, the Wall Street Journal has reported.

Russian prosecutors have issued warnings to several foreign entities – via calls, letters and in-person visits – including to Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Procter & Gamble, IBM and Yum! Brands, the parent company of KFC and Pizza Hut, according to the business daily, citing sources familiar with the matter.

They have threatened to arrest officials who have criticised the government or to seize assets, including intellectual property.

“The warnings have prompted at least one of the targeted companies to limit communications between its Russian business and the rest of the company, out of concern that emails or text messages among colleagues may be intercepted, some of the people (familiar with the matter) said,” according to the Wall Street Journal.

US, China aides to meet amid tensions over Russia

The US and China are sending top aides to meet in Rome on Monday amid mounting tensions between the two countries over the Russia-Ukraine war, with the US saying Russia has asked China for military equipment to help press its campaign.

In advance of the talks, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan bluntly warned China to avoid helping Russia evade punishment from global sanctions that have hammered the Russian economy. “We will not allow that to go forward,” he said.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has put China in a delicate spot with two of its biggest trading partners: the US and the European Union. China needs access to those markets, yet it also has shown support for Moscow, joining with Russia in declaring a friendship with “no limits”.

Russian default no longer ‘improbable’

Russia may default on its debts in the wake of unprecedented sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine, but that would not trigger a global financial crisis, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has said.

Georgieva told CBS’s “Face the Nation” programme that sanctions imposed by the United States and other democracies were already having a “severe” effect on the Russian economy and would trigger a deep recession there this year.

The sanctions were limiting Russia’s ability to access its resources and service its debts, which meant a default was no longer viewed as “improbable,” the IMF official said.

Asked if such a default could trigger a financial crisis around the world, she said, “For now, no.”

ICRC issues stark Mariupol warning

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has warned that residents of the besieged port city of Mariupol face a “worst-case scenario” unless Russia and Ukraine reach an agreement to ensure their immediate safety and access to humanitarian aid.

Ukrainian authorities say the city has been subject to relentless bombardment since Russian troops surrounded it on March 2. Read the full story here.

The southeastern port, totally surrounded by Russian troops since the first week of the invasion, has suffered the worst humanitarian impact of the war, with hundreds of thousands of people sheltering in basements without food, water or shelter.

Local Ukrainian authorities say as many as 2,500 civilians have died so far in the city, a toll that cannot be independently confirmed. Russia denies targetting civilians.

“At one o’clock (1100 GMT) the Russians opened a checkpoint and those who have cars and fuel began to leave Mariupol in the direction of Zaporizhzhia,” Andrei Rempel, a representative of the Mariupol city council who is now in Zaporizhzhia, a Ukrainian-held city further north, told Reuters.

“In the first two hours, 160 cars left. There are probably already many more now. The city continues to be bombed but this road is not being shelled. We don’t know when the first cars can get to Zaporizhzhia as there are still many Russian checkpoints that need to be passed.”

But Kyrylo Tymoshenko, a senior aide to president Volodymyr Zelenskiy later said Russia had yet again blocked a humanitarian aid convoy trying to reach the city with supplies.

Obtaining safe passage for aid to reach Mariupol and civilians to get out has been Kyiv’s main demand at several rounds of talks. All previous attempts at a local cease-fire in the area have failed.

“It's hard” says negotiator

Russian and Ukrainian delegations held a fourth round of talks on Monday — by video link rather than in person in neighboring Belarus as in the past — but no new progress was announced.

“Communication is being held yet it’s hard,” tweeted Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak, who had earlier created some hope of headway by saying on Sunday that Russia was beginning to talk “constructively.”

The talks had paused for the day but would resume on Tuesday. Russia “still has a delusion that 19 days of violence against (Ukrainian) peaceful cities is the right strategy,” he said.

Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky posted on social media that Russia was sticking to its key objectives: “We’re aiming to do everything possible for the achievement of the goals set by Vladimir Putin, for Russia’s peaceful future.”

Russia says it is conducting a “special operation” to demilitarise Ukraine. Ukraine and Western allies call this a baseless pretext for a war of aggression.

France said on Monday EU member states had agreed on a fourth package of sanctions against Russia.

Details were not officially disclosed, but diplomatic sources said they would include an import ban on Russian steel and iron, an export ban on luxury goods, and a ban on investment in the energy sector. Chelsea soccer team owner Roman Abramovich and 14 others would be added to the EU blacklist.

The United States made a public effort on Monday to put pressure on China not to help Russia avert sanctions.

Moscow and Beijing, which signed a friendship pact three weeks before the invasion, both denied accusations from US officials that Russia has asked China for weapons.

US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan met China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi in Rome on Monday. The State Deparment said Sullivan’s delegation had “raised directly and very clearly” concerns over Chinese support for Russia.

Nineteen days into Russia’s invasion, its troops have still failed to capture any of Ukraine’s 10 biggest cities, despite hammering several of them with relentless bombardment.

Drone video footage released by Ukrainian forces in Mariupol showed a desolate wasteland of bombed out buildings, many in flames, with smoke pouring into the sky.

Russian forces have been bearing down on Kyiv from the northeast and northwest, but have made little progress so far toward the capital itself, despite heavy fighting that has reduced suburbs on its outskirts to rubble. In Kyiv itself, an apartment block was hit by a missile overnight, killing at least one person, officials said.

Apartment resident Maksim Korovii said he and his mother had run out to the balcony after a staircase collapsed and the building caught fire. “We managed to put on whatever clothes we had at hand and made our way from balcony to balcony.”

In the south, where Russia has made more progress, residents of Odessa, a polyglot Black Sea port of 1 million people, fear their city could be next. They formed a human chain on Monday, singing patriotic songs as they carried sandbags from the beach.

In Donetsk, held since 2014 by Russian-backed separatists, Russia’s defense ministry said at least 20 people had been killed and 28 wounded by what it said was a Ukrainian missile with a cluster charge. It released footage of a missile on a busy street and vehicles destroyed by shrapnel.

Ukraine accused Russia or its allies of carrying out that attack themselves as a pretext: “It is unmistakably a Russian rocket or another munition,” Ukrainian military spokesman Leonid Matyukhin said. Reuters could not verify either account.",https://www.arabnews.com/node/2042086/world

Russia and Ukraine kept a fragile diplomatic path open with a new round of talks Monday even as Moscow's forces pounded away at Kyiv and other cities across the country in a punishing bombardment the Red Cross said has created ""nothing short of a nightmare"" for civilians.

Meanwhile, a convoy of 160 civilian cars left the encircled port city of Mariupol along a designated humanitarian route, the city council reported, in a rare glimmer of hope a week and a half into the lethal siege that has pulverized homes and other buildings and left people desperate for food, water, heat and medicine.

In the southern Ukrainian city, where the war has produced some of the greatest suffering, the city council didn't say how many people were in the convoy of cars headed west for the city of Zaporizhzhia. But it said a ceasefire along the route appeared to be holding.

Previous attempts to evacuate civilians and deliver humanitarian aid to the city of 430,000 were thwarted by continuing fighting.

Ukraine's military said it repelled an attempt Monday to take control of Mariupol by Russian forces, who were forced to retreat. Satellite images from Maxar Technologies showed fires burning across the city, with many high-rise apartment buildings heavily damaged or destroyed.

The Kremlin-backed leader of the Russian region of Chechnya said on a messaging app that Chechen fighters were spearheading the offensive on Mariupol.

Residential areas hit

Overnight, air raid alerts sounded in cities and towns around the country, from near the Russian border in the east to the Carpathian Mountains in the west, and fighting continued on the outskirts of Kyiv. Ukrainian officials said Russian forces shelled several suburbs of the capital.

Ukrainian authorities said two people were killed when the Russians struck an airplane factory in Kyiv, sparking a large fire. The Antonov factory is Ukraine's largest aircraft plant and produces many of the world's biggest cargo planes.

Russian artillery fire also hit a nine-storey apartment building in the northern Obolonskyi district of the city, killing two more people, authorities said.

Airstrikes were reported across the country, including the southern city of Mykolaiv, and the northern city of Chernihiv, where heat was knocked out to most of the town. Explosions also reverberated overnight around the Russian-occupied Black Sea port of Kherson.

Nine people were killed in a rocket attack on a TV tower in the western village of Antopol, according to the region's governor.

In the eastern city of Kharkiv, firefighters doused the smoldering remains of a four-storey residential building. It was unclear whether there were casualties.

The Russian military said 20 civilians in the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine were killed by a ballistic missile launched by Ukrainian forces. The claim could not be independently verified.

'Nightmare' humanitarian crisis

In the southern city of Mariupol, where the war has produced some of the greatest suffering, the city council didn't say how many people were in the convoy of cars headed westward for the city of Zaporizhzhia. But it said a cease-fire along the route appeared to be holding.

Previous attempts to evacuate civilians and deliver humanitarian aid to the city of 430,000 were thwarted by continuing fighting.

Robert Mardini, director-general of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said the war has become ""nothing short of a nightmare"" for those living in besieged cities, and he pleaded for safe corridors for civilians to leave and humanitarian aid to be brought in.

The UN has recorded at least 596 civilian deaths since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, though it believes the true toll is much higher. Millions more have fled their homes, with more than 2.8 million crossing into Poland and other neighbouring countries in what the UN has called Europe's biggest refugee crisis since the Second World War.

A pregnant woman who became a symbol of Ukraine's suffering when she was photographed being carried from a bombed maternity hospital in Mariupol last week has died along with her baby, The Associated Press has learned.

4th round of negotiations

The latest negotiations, held via video conference, were the fourth round of talks involving higher-level officials from the two countries and the first in a week.

The talks ended without a breakthrough after several hours, with an aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky saying the negotiators took ""a technical pause"" and planned to meet again Tuesday.

The two sides had expressed some optimism in the past few days. Mykhailo Podolyak, the aide to Zelensky, tweeted that the negotiators would discuss ""peace, ceasefire, immediate withdrawal of troops & security guarantees.""

Previous discussions, held in person in Belarus, produced no lasting humanitarian routes or agreements to end the fighting.

In Washington, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at a briefing Monday that while the Biden administration supports Ukraine's participation in the talks with Russia, Russian President Vladimir Putin would have to show signs of de-escalating in order to demonstrate good faith.

""And what we're really looking for is evidence of that, and we're not seeing any evidence at this point that President Putin is doing anything to stop the onslaught or de-escalate,"" she said.

U.S.-China talks

During a meeting in Rome with a senior Chinese diplomat, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan warned China against helping Russia.

Two administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information, said China had signaled to Moscow that it would be willing to provide both military support in Ukraine and financial backing to help stave off the effects of Western sanctions.

The Kremlin has denied asking China for military equipment to use in Ukraine.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that ""Russia has its own potential to continue the operation"" and that it was ""unfolding in accordance with the plan and will be completed on time and in full.""

The war expanded Sunday when Russian missiles pounded a military training base in western Ukraine, close to the Polish border, that previously served as a crucial hub for co-operation between Ukraine and NATO.

The attack killed 35 people, Ukrainian officials said, and raised fears that NATO could be drawn into direct conflict with Russia.

The senior U.S. defence official said the base was not being used at the time as a shipment site for U.S. military supplies to Ukraine.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ukraine-russia-1.6383893

ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine — As hundreds of thousands of civilians trapped in the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol have waited in desperation for an escape, Yulia Karaulan has been desperately trying to make it in. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight Carrying nothing but a small blue leather handbag, the 38-year-old mother hauled herself into the last truck in a more than 30-vehicle humanitarian convoy heading into the city Saturday.

She couldn’t bear the feeling of helplessness, of being outside as her husband, mother and 10-year-old daughter were at the mercy of Russian bombs and slowly running out of food.

“My life is my child, and I cannot get to her,” she said. “I feel so guilty that I’m not there.”

Mariupol, the port on the Sea of Azov where Karaulan grew up, is under a stranglehold from Russian troops. For the past week, a convoy laden with food and essential medicines has repeatedly set off from Zaporizhzhia, 120 miles to the northwest, attempting to reach the city. In addition to the 10 trucks carrying food and medical supplies that left Saturday, there were 20 empty buses, optimistically readied for evacuating civilians.

Each time so far, the vehicles have been forced to turn back.

Past convoys have been shot at and shelled by Russian forces. An ambulance returned pockmarked with bullet holes. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has called it “outright terror” by Russian forces. Inside Mariupol, bodies lie rotting in the streets in areas too dangerous to retrieve them, witnesses said. Municipal workers have dug mass graves.

The death toll is impossible to verify, but city officials say it amounts to more than 1,500 people — above the number of civilian deaths the United Nations has verified in the entire country. This past week, a massive explosion destroyed parts of the maternity and children’s hospital. Swaths of the city have been laid to waste. There is no drinking water, and desperation has led to looting and lawlessness, according to accounts.

Karaulan knows that even if she makes it in to her child and husband of 11 years, she could get stuck with them.

“It’s my right as a mother for us to die together,” she said. “But I don’t want to die together. I want us to live together.”

Away during invasion

Karaulan was on a business trip to Parma, Italy, when the invasion began. Her photo gallery is a reel of pizzas and frivolity. The war rhetoric had been building for weeks but “nobody believed it,” she said. “We hoped he wasn’t crazy,” she said of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

She was supposed to fly home Feb. 24, the day Russia attacked, but the airspace was closed. She arranged a flight to Poland. She still wasn’t too concerned. Her husband reported back that all was fine at home in Mariupol. “If I had imagined what was going to happen, I would have got there immediately,” she said.

It was only on March 2 that the seriousness of the situation sank in. Her husband and daughter were forced to move from the apartment the family bought two years ago. They relocated to a community shelter to escape the shelling and explosions.

“How are you?” she messaged her husband. But the message didn’t go through. Communications had been cut.

Karaulan quit smoking a decade ago when she was pregnant, but started again that day. Eight days later, gripping a slim menthol cigarette between her baby-pink manicured nails, she shivered in the cold outside a performance space turned welcome center in Zaporizhzhia for Ukrainians fleeing Russia’s advance.

“I will stop when I see my family again,” she said. She crossed the Polish border on March 4 and made her way southeast to as close as she could get to Mariupol. She has been coming to the center every day to volunteer. Anything to distract her mind.

She’s been stuck in Zaporizhzhia, waiting.

“I go to bed every night hoping I will see my daughter the next day, but then every day realize that’s not going to happen,” she said. She’s dissociating, she said, and is watching her life pass by like it’s a movie. She can’t look at photos of them. It’s too hard.

She messaged details to her husband about where to go to meet the buses that were supposed to arrive via a humanitarian corridor supposedly hashed out between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators. That message also didn’t get through.

It wasn’t until a week after communications were cut that she knew whether her family members were alive or dead. When the call came on a faint phone connection, it was her daughter who spoke first.

“I told my daughter I was coming,” said Karaulan. Her husband took the phone.

“Don’t, please. It’s hell here,” he told her. “Please don’t come, you can’t imagine.”

He described the shelter where they were trapped with 4,000 other people. He said food was running out. Because it’s a large group, some water is delivered when possible amid the bombing.

But the water isn’t good to drink, she said.

And then her mother’s voice came over the phone. “If God allows it, we will meet,” her mother said.

Her mother, a Russian national, is sheltering with Karaulan’s husband and child. “I never divided Russians and Ukrainians. For me it’s like one nation,” Karaulan said. “It’s Russian people bombing Russian people. It’s crazy. I thought we were all brothers.”

“It’s the most senseless and unfair war,” she said. “It’s not my story. It’s not the story of my husband.”

A friend called on Wednesday. She told Karaulan that her family was lucky to be in a community shelter where there are some supplies. Her friend and her family are trapped in the basement of their home.

For drinking water, they melt snow or gather water from pools. There is no electricity.

“They bought liver and meat before the war,” she said, but it has gone bad. “They now salted it, and tried to cook it somehow, the spoiled food, at least to try to eat something.”

And rats are everywhere.

“She said they are all just dying there,” Karaulan said.

Her words are urgent and tumbling: “While we are talking here, they are simply dying.”

The city she loved is in ruins, but there is still a chance to save lives, she said.

“Today they are alive,” she added, “but what will be tomorrow, we don’t know.”

The same day she talked to her husband, Karaulan met one family that managed to escape Mariupol, a couple with a baby. They turned up at the center, the windows of their vehicle smashed out. They said they drove through the front lines and the shelling.

They exchanged numbers. Later that evening, the woman called to tell Karaulan that a bomb had fallen on the shelter where her family had sought refuge. She told Karaulan that her family was killed. At that moment, Karaulan was in the apartment where she was being put up in Zaporizhzhia, with friends of a colleague. She collapsed in the corridor.

“I couldn’t even move,” she said. “I was just sitting watching the wall.”

She needed the bathroom, but she couldn’t stand.

“I thought my family is dead, and I was thinking about how to join them,” she said. “I wasn’t sane.”

Her hosts, however, told her there had been no news of such a bombing in Mariupol.

“I didn’t believe them,” she said. She called the police, the emergency services, everyone she knew, before realizing it was not true. She has no idea why the woman told her that her family was dead. She has now blocked her on messaging apps.

The next day her husband got through again, but just for a moment.

‘Everything is bad’

“What is the news?” he asked. “Please do something, everything is very bad, people are dying.”

The call ended.

Since that Thursday morning she’s had no contact.

“I don’t know whether they are alive. I have no idea what is going on there right now. I cannot reach them again.”

She’d thought of simply getting to a nearby village and walking to the city.

“But I understand that if I do that, I’ll probably be dead, and my child will still be alive,” she said. “It’s not a solution. I’m just trying to understand what I can do in this situation.”

She managed to get on the humanitarian convoy for the first time on Friday afternoon. Speaking by phone en route, she described her mission as if she were doing a quick school run: “I just want to pick up my family.”

Friday’s convoy made it only a few miles. They parked on the highway for hours. She was told the route was not safe, that there was shelling. They turned back. She cried all the way to Zaporizhzhia.

On Saturday, they set out earlier. She was more hopeful. A dozen clergymen from the Ukrainian Orthodox Church chanted a prayer before dividing themselves among the convoy.

A priest on one of the buses made the sign of the cross as the convoy pulled out. “God’s with me,” said Andrey Kovalenko, a bishop who traveled in an ambulance with a wooden cross taped to the windscreen. “Of course, who doesn’t worry, every normal person worries.”

Karaulan, though, said she feels no fear. Wearing a faux-fur-lined coat and a top with the slogan “Best Runner” across the front in diamanté studs, she waved goodbye as her truck pulled out toward the highway.

“How can you be afraid if your child is there?”

Kramer', 'Mike Ives', 'Alexandra Stevenson', 'John Yoon', 'Azi Paybarah', 'David Moll']",2022-03-03 00:00:00,"A fire broke out early Friday at a complex in southern Ukraine housing Europe’s largest nuclear power plant after Russian troops fired on the area, and the Russian military later took control of the site, Ukrainian officials said.

Security camera footage verified by The New York Times showed a building ablaze inside the Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex near a line of military vehicles. The videos appeared to show people in the vehicles firing at buildings in the power plant. Ukraine’s state emergency service later said the blaze went out after 6 a.m.

The fire did not affect essential equipment at the plant, the International Atomic Energy Agency said on Twitter, citing its communication with the Ukrainian government.

About an hour after dawn, Ukraine’s nuclear regulatory inspectorate said in a statement that Russian military forces were now occupying the complex. It said that all of the site’s power units remained intact and that no changes in radiation levels had been observed.

The fire broke out after a Russian attack on a training building outside the perimeter of the plant, according to a statement by Ukraine’s state emergency service. A spokesman for the nuclear plant, Andriy Tuz, was quoted by The Associated Press as telling Ukrainian television that shells had set fire to one of the plant’s six reactors that was under renovation and not operating.

Ukraine’s nuclear inspectorate later said in its statement that one unit of the six units was operating, another was in “outage,” two were being cooled down, and two others had been disconnected from the grid.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine had accused the Russian military of deliberately attacking the complex and said an explosion there would have been “the end for everybody, the end of Europe.”

“Only immediate actions by Europe could stop the Russian army,” he added.

President Biden spoke with Mr. Zelensky about the fire and joined him in urging Russia to “cease its military activities in the area and allow firefighters and emergency responders to access the site,” the White House said. Local reports later said that emergency crews had gained access.

Mr. Biden’s energy secretary, Jennifer M. Granholm, said on Twitter that the United States had not detected elevated radiation readings in the area, echoing an earlier assessment by the International Atomic Energy Agency. “The plant’s reactors are protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down,” she said.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain said he would seek an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council about the blaze at the complex, according to his office.

Before the fire was reported by Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, the director general for the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement that “a large number of Russian tanks and infantry” had entered Enerhodar, a town next to the plant. The director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said that troops were “moving directly” toward the reactor site.

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex, on the Dnieper River roughly a hundred miles north of Crimea, is the largest in Europe. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, its six reactors produce a total of 6,000 megawatts of electric power.

In comparison, the Chernobyl plant in northern Ukraine produced 3,800 megawatts — about a third less. (A megawatt, one million watts, is enough power to light 10,000 hundred-watt bulbs.) The four reactors of the Chernobyl complex were shut down after one suffered a catastrophic fire and meltdown in 1986.

The reactors’ cores are full of highly radioactive fuel. But an additional danger at the Zaporizhzhia site is the many acres of open pools of water behind the complex where spent fuel rods have been cooled for years. Experts fear that errant shells or missiles that hit such sites could set off radiological disasters.

For days, social media reports have detailed how the residents of Enerhodar set up a giant barrier of tires, vehicles and metal barricades to try to block a Russian advance into the city and the reactor site. Christoph Koettl, a visual investigator for The New York Times, noted on Twitter that the barricades were so large that they could be seen from outer space by orbiting satellites.

Starting this past Sunday, three days into the invasion, Ukraine’s nuclear regulator began reporting an unusual rate of disconnection: Six of the nation’s 15 reactors were offline. On Tuesday, the Zaporizhzhia facility was the site with the most reactors offline.
