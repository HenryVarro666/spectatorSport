Press secretary Jen Psaki once again insisted that President Biden had no “intention” of directly intervening in the two-week-old war — even as bipartisan US lawmakers accused the administration of being too cautious in the face of the Russian president bloody offensive.

“I’m not going to get into hypotheticals,” press secretary Jen Psaki, who tweeted Wednesday that such an attack was possible, told reporters. “What we’re saying right now is they [Russian forces] have the capacity and the capabilities. I’m also not going to get into intelligence. But the President’s intention of sending US military to fight in Ukraine against Russia has not changed.”

The term “red line” generally refers to a threshold that would trigger direct US involvement in a conflict. The phrase was notoriously used — without follow-through — by President Barack Obama in 2013 to warn Moscow-backed Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad against using chemical weapons that country’s civil war.

Psaki again refused to be drawn on the question when NBC News reporter Peter Alexander asked: “Is there any ‘red line’ for Russia that the US would have some involvement with the military entering into Ukraine?”

“I’m not going to get into red lines from here, Peter,” Psaki answered before touting the effectiveness of American aid to the beleagued Eastern Euopean nation.

“Given the potential that you’ve indicated that Russia could use a bio or chemical weapons strike there,” Alexander followed up, “why wouldn’t the US communicate to them something that is not an answer, but instead is pre-emptive, to communicate the consequence if they are to take what would be to take this war to a horrific new level?”

“The president’s first and most important objective is the national security and interests of the United States and being clear and direct with the American people,” Psaki replied. “He has been clear and direct with the American people: He is not intending to send US troops to fight in Ukraine against Russia to start another war. That would be an escalatory step that would not be in our national security interests.”

Turning to Biden’s decision to decline a Polish offer to hand over 28 MiG-29 fighter jets to help Ukraine fight off the Russian attack, Alexander asked Psaki point-blank why giving Ukraine the jets was “a higher risk than not providing them [when] we’re witnessing civilians die as we speak.”

Russia continued it’s attack on Ukraine on March 10, 2022.

The chief White House spokeswoman responded by invoking the specter of World War III.

“I would say what our assessment is based on is how to prevent a world war here, Peter,” Psaki deadpanned, “which is a significant weight that the intelligence community, the Defense Department and the president of the United States weighs at every moment in time.”

Biden reportedly made the call to scrap the MiG transfer, overriding his Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who said Sunday Poland had a “green light” to move forward. The mixed messages put Vice President Kamala Harris in an awkward position as she met Thursday with the Polish President Andrzej Duda.

Psaki echoed other administration officials by referring to what she called “an escalation ladder.”

“There’s a difference between an anti-tank weapon, a shoulder-fired missile, and aircraft, and a fighter jet that could cross the border and actually conduct operations on Russian soil,” the press secretary claimed, adding that Biden opted to nix the Polish proposal because the US is “trying to prevent ourselves from taking steps that would be further escalatory.”

The press secretary also rejected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s insistence that the jets would help his countrymen fend off Russian troops who are moving to encircle major cities.

“What our military experts… assessed was that adding aircraft to the inventory is not likely to significantly change the effectiveness of the Ukrainian Air Force relative to Russian capability,” Psaki said. “The Ukrainian Air Force has several squadrons of fully mission-capable aircraft and although Russian air capabilities are significant, their effectiveness has been limited due to Ukrainian strategic operational and tactical ground-based air defense systems — surface to air missiles and MANPADS.”

It’s unclear why Ukraine has not used its air force to bomb a miles-long Russian convoy north of capital city Kyiv, though some experts speculate that Ukrainian leaders are reserving equipment for a potential counterattack if enemy forces get closer to the capital.

Biden’s decision has caused an uproar from lawmakers of both parties on Capitol Hill, most notably members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

“I simply do not understand the logic for not getting the MiGs to the Ukrainians immediately,” Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said during a committee hearing Thursday.

“I believe there’s a sentiment that we’re fearful about what Putin might do and what he might consider as an escalation,” Romney added. “It’s time for him to be fearful of what we might do.”

“There is bipartisan support to provide these planes,” noted Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH). “It is disappointing to see the reluctance on the part of the administration. It’s coming across as indecision and bickering among members of the administration, which is not helpful to the cause.”

“Time is of the essence,” agreed committee chairman Bob Menendez (D-NJ), who added: “I understand why NATO and the United States are not engaged in a no-fly zone [in Ukraine]. That has potential [for] direct conflict with Russia, but I don’t understand why we are not working to facilitate planes to Ukraine.”

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said the decision marked “a dishonorable day for America.”

“Putin has got to be happy today, knowing he backed us down,” he added.

Biden has ordered a wide range of sanctions against Russia in response to Putin’s invasion, but only adopted the harshest measures after bipartisan criticism.

Biden initially announced limited sanctions against state-owned Russian banks and certain Russian businessmen when tanks rolled across Ukraine’s borders on Feb, 24. After criticism, Biden sanctioned Putin’s vast personal wealth and reached an agreement with US allies to partially unplug Russia from the SWIFT international banking system.

As a broad bipartisan alliance in Congress readied legislation to force his hand, Biden on Tuesday announced an import ban on Russia oil, natural gas and coal.

In addition to the bombardment of the maternity ward of a hospital in the eastern city of Mariupol, Russian forces have used thermobaric weapons that burn the lungs of victims, as well as cluster bombs in residential areas of the country’s second-largest city Kharkiv.

Last week, Russian forces seized Europe’s largest nuclear power facility in Zaporizhzhia, southern Ukraine, and officials revealed Wednesday that Russian troops had disconnected the abandoned Chernobyl nuclear site from the local electrical grid.",https://nypost.com/2022/03/10/white-house-says-us-trying-to-prevent-a-world-war-by-denying-ukraine-jets/

10 Mar 2022 16.36 A report from the US Census Bureau released today reveals that the 2020 US census undercounted 18.8m Black, indigenous and Latino Americans. Here’s more from Maya Yang: The 2020 US census undercounted America’s Latino population at more than three times the rate of the 2010 census, according to a report released on Thursday by the US Census Bureau. The census also undercounted the nation’s Black and Native American residents, while overcounting non-Hispanic white people and Asian Americans. The census helps guide the annual federal distribution of $1.5tn for public services including education, healthcare and transportation. Undercounting communities results in reduced political representation on local, state and federal level. According to the report, Latinos had a net undercount of nearly 5%. The Black population had a net undercount of 3.3%, a slight increase from a 2.1% shortfall a decade ago. American Indian and Alaska Natives living on reservations had a net undercount of 5.6%, up from 4.9% in the last census. The non-Latino white population had a net overcount in the 2020 census of 1.6% while Asians had a net overcount of 2.6%. In comparison, the non-Latino white population had a net overcount of 0.8% in 2010 while Asians had a net undercount of 0.08% that year. Overall, the 2020 census overlooked 0.24% of the total US population. In 2010, the census missed 0.01% of the national population.

10 Mar 2022 15.49 Joe Biden had a phone call earlier today with Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan, where Erdogan reportedly urged Biden to lift the “unjust” sanctions on Turkey’s defense industry, according to a statement from Erdogan’s office. Erdogan informed Biden that Turkey is planning to request purchases of 40 new F-16 fighter jets as well as kits to modernize its existing fleet. Congress put sanctions on five Turkish officials after the Turkish government purchased Russian missile defense systems. A brief White House statement on Erdogan’s call with Biden did not mention any specific discussion of the sanctions but said that they “discussed opportunities to strengthen bilateral ties. The White House said that the leaders “discussed their shared concern about Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine” and Biden “expressed appreciation for Turkey’s efforts to support diplomatic resolution to the conflict”.



10 Mar 2022 15.27 Joan E Greve Democrats are pinning the blame for rising gas prices on Valdimir Putin and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, while accusing Republicans of exploiting the issue for political gain. On a press call with Democratic Senator Gary Peters today, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Jaime Harrison, said Republicans should focus more of their energy on trying to help average Americans struggling with the higher prices at the gas pump.

Republicans have argued that the high prices are the result of Joe Biden’s energy and climate policies, but Harrison noted the oil and gas industry is currently sitting on more than 9,000unused drilling permits in the US.

“Putin and this unjust war that he has sparked in Ukraine is the culprit behind why we’re seeing these gas prices skyrocket, particularly over the past few days,” Harrison said.



Biden has tried to send a similar message to the country, saying on Tuesday, “I’m going to do everything I can to minimize Putin’s price hike here at home.”

Average gas prices in the US have now hit a record high of $4.318, according to AAA. Experts warn prices will keep increasing as the war continues, especially now that Biden has announced a ban on Russian oil imports. Harrison said Thursday, “I hope that Republicans, instead of trying to use this as a political ploy, will actually roll up their sleeves and try to help alleviate some of the pressure off of American families as well.”



10 Mar 2022 15.08 The trial of four men charged with plotting to kidnap Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer in 2020 has kicked off this week. Jurors today heard disturbing audio recordings provided by a government informant of the men discussing their plan to kidnap Whitmer. Here’s more from the Associated Press: Prosecutors in the trial of four men charged with plotting to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Thursday played covertly recorded audio for jurors in which one of the men specifically discusses a plan to abduct the Democrat. In the recording, made by a government informant during a meeting in mid-July 2020 in Wisconsin, Barry Croft Jr. describes the possibility of using explosives to “rain down” fire on law enforcement “with a team standing by” to abduct Whitmer. He adds without providing details that it should be “a quick precise grab” of the governor. In another recording made by the same informant, jurors heard the sound of an explosives test Croft was conducting. He’s later heard speaking almost giddily about the damage he could cause, saying it would be “devastating.” Prosecutors say the men — Croft, Adam Fox, Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta — planned to snatch Whitmer from her Michigan vacation home because they were angry about pandemic restrictions she imposed. They also planned to blow up a nearby bridge to slow the police response. The audio played in the federal courtroom in Grand Rapids, Michigan, marked the first time the jury heard a defendant talking specifically about abducting Whitmer. In other recordings played, Croft and Fox mentioned Whitmer and spoke excitedly about taking action that would terrorize people. “I’m gonna hit soon,” Croft is heard saying during what prosecutors say was a crucial June 6, 2020, meeting of antigovernment activists in Ohio. “ I’m going to terrorize people. The right people. The people who have been terrorizing my people.”

10 Mar 2022 13.58 The White House expects that gas and energy prices will continue to go up, saying that inflation is higher because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In her press briefing this afternoon, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the president has “conveyed very clearly to the American public” that they will see higher prices at the pump. “We also believe it will be temporary and not long-lasting. What our focus is on now is doing everything we can to mitigate and reduce those prices and ensure there isn’t a longer term impact.” A report from the labor department earlier today showed that inflation jumped 7.9% over the past year – the highest increase since 1982. Psaki emphasized that the inflation seen over the next few months is higher than what it would have been if Russia had not invaded Ukraine. Answering a question from a reporter on what the White House can tell Americans who are wondering how long inflation will lsat, Psaki pointed to the effectiveness of US sanctions against Russia. “Because of our efforts, the ruble is worth a penny. It’s the lowest-ranked currency. The Russian stock market has not even opened,” Psaki said. “You’ve seen outcry from a number of President Putin’s buddies… who we have all been squeezing.”

Russia Continues Its WMD Disinformation With Help As Concerns Grow About False Flag Operations

Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) and Ministry of Defense (MOD) continued their barrage of claims alleging the US is helping the Ukrainians make WMDs, this time asserting the Russian military found evidence the Ukrainians staged an emergency clean-up to eradicate “…traces of the military-biological programme, in Ukraine, financed by the [US Department of Defense].” Major General Igor Konashenkov delivered this latest claim, which was quickly parroted by state media. He claimed pathogens such as the causative agents of plague, anthrax, and cholera were being made into bioweapons in US-funded laboratories throughout Ukraine. The MFA also claimed on March 6 that the Security Service of Ukraine and Azov Battalion “mined a reactor at an experimental nuclear facility at the Kharkov Institute of Physics and Technology” in order to “accuse Russia of creating an ecological catastrophe.” The Atlantic Council noted that this claim was based on a supposed alert from the Russian MOD and was supplemented by quotes from the state-owned outlet, Sputnik.

❗️ @mod_russia: During the course of the special military operation evidence of an emergency clean-up performed by the Kiev regime was found – aimed at eradicating traces of the military-biological programme, in Ukraine, financed by @DeptofDefense.

The Sino-Russian Relationship Isn’t Complicated Enough To Keep China Away From These Conspiracy Theories Apparently

Various Chinese outlets have already been sharing Russia’s narrative, however the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has more formally begun doing so as well. PRC MFA spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, made several comments at a press briefing this week accusing the US of violating the BWC at its labs in Ukraine. He accused the US of preventing multilateral verifications of these facilities from taking place before saying, “What is the real intention of the United States? What exactly has it done? These have always been the source of misgivings for the international community.” A description of DTRA’s CTR program’s accomplishments in its first 25 years is available here.

This is also not China’s first time making such claims. Throughout and following the Korean War, North Korea, the Soviet Union, and China claimed the United States used biological weapons on large scale in both China and North Korea. Though Soviet Central Committee documents indicating these claims were known to be false were declassified in 1998, both North Korea and China have continued to make these claims over the decades. As we previously covered, China has a number of nonsense claims they have made recently too, including assertions that the US engineered COVID-19 at the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, that the US military introduced SARS-CoV-2 to Wuhan at the World Military Games in 2019, and even that the Omicron variant entered the country on a piece of mail from Canada.

This comes at a time when many are questioning the strength of the Sino-Russian relationship, as Xi Jinping tries to balance supporting Putin while shielding his country from the economic hardship and isolation the world has levied on Russia. It also remains unclear how much Chinese officials actually knew about Russia’s plans to invade Ukraine, though it is thought they had at least some level of advance knowledge and asked Putin to wait until after the Beijing Olympics. The two countries issued a joint statement last month, titled “Joint Statement of the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China on the International Relations Entering a New Era and the Global Sustainable Development”. It included a section on the BWC and claims the US is not fulfilling its obligations under the treaty, stating “The sides emphasize that domestic and foreign bioweapons activities by the United States and its allies raise serious concerns and questions for the international community regarding their compliance with the BWC.” It later stated, “The sides call on the U.S. and its allies to act in an open, transparent, and responsible manner by properly reporting on their military biological activities conducted overseas and on their national territory, and by supporting the resumption of negotiations on a legally binding BWC Protocol with an effective verification mechanism.”

Russian Outlets’ Lazy Attempts at Disinfo Somehow Still Have the Desired Effect

This all somehow managed to grow worse late this week as the US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs, Victoria Nuland, testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Over the course of the hearing, she stated “Ukraine has biological research facilities which, in fact, we are now quite concerned Russian troops…Russian forces may be seeking to gain control of. So we are working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces should they approach.” She later stated that, should there be any of use of CBW in Ukraine, the Russians would be behind it. Russian outlets like RT and Sputnik were quick to re-share the unedited clip, which their followers concluded meant Nuland was confirming the US has biological weapons facilities in Ukraine. This was echoed by the likes of American conservative commentators Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens on their respective platforms. RT did not have to do any work to splice the clips of Nuland, create confusion about the context, or anything to get this clip spread around, viewed millions of times, and touted as proof the US was lying about having BW facilities in Ukraine. They simply played an accurate statement from the undersecretary and let their audiences do the rest. This has been a rapid progression from the situation a couple weeks ago, with Foreign Policy’s Justin Ling writing, “In less than two weeks, a conspiracy theory about Ukrainian biolabs has gone from a fringe QAnon Twitter account to becoming a major rallying cry for both Russian President Vladimir Putin’s regime and the U.S. far-right.”

In case it somehow is not clear enough already- the terms “biological research facilities” and “biolabs” do not mean the same thing as “biological weapons facilities”. A biological research facility just describes an institution or building where research is being conducted in some area of biology. Different types of hospital research labs, labs at zoos, numerous university labs, and all sorts of institutions can accurately be described as “biological research facilities”. As a result of the threat Russian forces pose to these facilities in Ukraine, the WHO advised Ukraine on Thursday to destroy high-threat pathogens from their public health labs to prevent “any potential spills” that could cause disease in the population.

Birds of Mass Destruction?

On Thursday, the Russian MOD released a video discussing the supposed results of their report about documents from “military biological activities of the USA in Ukraine”. The MOD included screenshots of various Power Point slides and materials from DTRA throughout the presentation, including an unclassified slide discussing the risk of emerging infections in insectivorous bats in Ukraine and Georgia and the need for interagency efforts to stem the threat to public health this poses. The video then makes a number of wild claims that make even some of the most ardent conspiracy theorists look comparatively poised and logically sound. Such claims include that the US wants to release migrating birds carrying highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza. Another claim is that a Project R-781 is focused on US efforts to use bats as carriers for biological weapons. This is simply non-sensical. The US does not conduct bioweapons R&D, it certainly would not need to do so in Ukraine if it wanted to, and releasing birds, bats, and insects carrying highly infectious diseases would likely harm the US as well as any intended target. It is highly unlikely the Russians believe any of this to be true and they are just using this as an attempt to keep up the pressure in their disinformation firehose and create frustrations and tensions where possible.

A Note On Biosafety Levels

Some of those re-sharing these posts from Russian outlets have also focused their attention on the biosafety levels (BSL) of the CTR labs in Ukraine, claiming they must be making bioweapons because they have certain BSL designations. Those making these claims seem to either focus on the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s BSL-4 designation, somehow concluding this means the Ukrainian labs must also be at this level and, by extension, they are making bioweapons. Others focus on the term “high containment lab”, either assuming or purposefully deceitfully claiming that term means the labs are BSL-4 labs by definition. First, Ukraine does not have a BSL-4 facility. Second, the term “high containment lab” refers to both BSL-3 and BSL-4 facilities. Third, many of these claims are based on an out-of-context clip of a chapter of a National Academies Press publication– “Biosecurity Challenges of the Global Expansion of High-Containment Biological Laboratories: Summary of a Workshop”. This specific chapter discusses local resources and regulations for high containment labs in Ukraine in which the authors discuss the differences in how Ukrainian labs are rated (lab designation in Ukraine is inverted, so 1 is the highest risk and 4 is the lowest) and why this makes it especially important to consider what specific permits Ukrainian labs have that allow them to handle certain pathogens. Furthermore, the biosafety level of a lab is not an indicator of what that facility is doing. Rather, BSLs are sets of biocontainment precautions required to work with biological agents in laboratories. They are sometimes called pathogen, protection, or containment levels, the latter of which uses the designations P1-P4 instead.

For context, BSL-4 is the highest level of precautions and is used for work with agents that can easily be transmitted as aerosols in the lab, cause severe to fatal disease in humans, and for which there are no available vaccines or treatments. Some BSL-4 agents include Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, and Nipah viruses. The other levels can vary in terms of which pathogens are handled in them depending on the conditions and the work being conducted, such as if there were a high chance an agent would become aerosolized while being worked with, which would necessitate a higher BSL. Common BSL-3 agents include SARS classic, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, Rift Valley Fever virus, and even Yersinia pestis, the bacterium that causes plague. Some examples of potential BSL-2 agents include pathogenic strains of E. coli, Hepatitits A, B, and C viruses, HIV, and even prions, which transmit diseases like Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (the human version of Mad Cow Disease). Things like non-pathogenic strains of E. coli and different types of Staphylococcus are frequently handled in BSL-1, including in labs at secondary education institutions.

While abiding by federal law and research guidelines, different institutions in the US place different agents at different BSL levels based on their facility’s capabilities, what they plan to do with an agent, and what risks may come of such work. You can see Stanford University’s list and guidelines here, for example. The Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories, the document that helps labs make protocol-driven risk assessments and determine what BSL they should work in is also freely available online.

Furthermore, a BSL-4 designation does not imply the lab is government-run, and certainly does not mean it is necessarily doing offensive research. Using the US as an example, of the 13 BSL-4 labs in the US, three are housed at universities – Boston University’s National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories, Georgia State University’s High Containment Core, and the University of Texas Medical Branch’s Galveston National Laboratory. Kansas State University also has its BSL-4 National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility under construction. Fewer than 1/5 of BSL-4 facilities globally are actually defense laboratories and two are even privately-owned, according to Global Bio Labs. USA Today also found a few years ago that there are around 200 BSL-3 labs (at least) in the US, meaning many Americans live near one. Meanwhile, the labs in Ukraine are below BSL-4 and they are well-established centers providing important public health research and services. In fact, the closest BSL-4s to Ukraine are the Republican Research and Practical Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology in Minsk, Belarus and two facilities in Hungary. Furthermore, the US has been open from the beginning about the purpose and scope of the Lugar-Nunn Cooperative Threat Reduction program as well. And while just one-quarter of countries with BSL-4 labs score well on best practice indicators for biosafety and biosecurity, the Lugar-Nunn program has helped ensure partner countries do meet these requirements consistently, limiting the chances of accidents.

Is This All a Set Up For a False Flag Operation? The US Government Weighs In

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki commented on this ongoing issue on Twitter earlier in the week, stating, “We took note of Russia’s false claims about alleged U.S. biological weapons labs and chemical weapons development in Ukraine. We’ve also seen Chinese officials echo these conspiracy theories.” She re-iterated that this is something Russia and China have done repeatedly, adding that the US is in full-compliance with its obligations under the BWC and CWC. She also stated, “It’s Russia that has a long and well-documented track record of using chemical weapons, including in attempted assassinations and poisoning of Putin’s political enemies like Alexey Navalny.” She concluded with a warning that Russia might look to use chemical or biological weapons to create a false flag operation, writing, “Now that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them. It’s a clear pattern.”

Now that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them. It’s a clear pattern. — Jen Psaki (@PressSec) March 9, 2022 White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki’s tweets concerning Russian allegations the US is supporting chemical and biological weapons development in Ukraine.

Finally, the US State Department also released an official statement on the Kremlin’s claims. State Department Spokesperson Ned Price’s delivered the following statement:

The Kremlin is intentionally spreading outright lies that the United States and Ukraine are conducting chemical and biological weapons activities in Ukraine. We have also seen PRC officials echo these conspiracy theories. This Russian disinformation is total nonsense and not the first time Russia has invented such false claims against another country. Also, these claims have been debunked conclusively and repeatedly over many years. As we have said all along, Russia is inventing false pretexts in an attempt to justify its own horrific actions in Ukraine. The United States does not own or operate any chemical or biological laboratories in Ukraine, it is in full compliance with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention and Biological Weapons Convention, and it does not develop or possess such weapons anywhere. It is Russia that has active chemical and biological weapons programs and is in violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and Biological Weapons Convention. Finally, Russia has a track record of accusing the West of the very crimes that Russia itself is perpetrating. These tactics are an obvious ploy by Russia to try to justify further premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified attacks on Ukraine. We fully expect Russia to continue to double down on these sorts of claims with further unfounded allegations.

While it remains unclear if the Russians are interested in using CBW or trying to stage a false flag operation, there are still inherent dangers to these types of weapons that dissuade actors from their use, though some still certainly do use these kinds of weapons. Furthermore, as Dr. Filippa Lentzos and Jez Littlewood pointed out in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists this week, this could also end up damaging the Biological Weapons Convention, set for its five-year review later this year. They also rightfully point out that the US identified a number of countries as BW threats, including the DPRK, Iran, Libya, Syria, Sudan, and Iraq, the latter of which is arguably the most infamous intelligence failure of the US this century. Few could forget the images of Secretary of State Colin Powell holding up a model vial of anthrax spores during a meeting of the UNSC on Iraq’s alleged WMD program in 2003. While this assessment was not just based on US intelligence alone, this was later something he described as a “blot” on his career, stating “I’m the one who presented it on behalf of the United States to the world, and [it] will always be a part of my record. It was painful. It’s painful now.” While the US has not been perfect, the labs under DTRA’s CTR program have demonstrated time and time again that they are legitimately conducting peaceful research and that they provide benefits to the public health of the region.

US Surgeon General Releases RFI on COVID-19 Disinformation

On a related note, to help combat the effects of disinformation in the United States, the US Surgeon General, VADM Vivek Murthy (USPHS), has issued a formal request for information to major tech companies, asking them to send data and information on the prevalence of COVID-19 mis-/disinformation on their platforms. This is part of the Biden administration’s National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan and companies will have until May 2 to comply with the RFI. Dr. Murthy also has asked healthcare professionals to submit their testimonies about how COVID-19 mis- and disinformation have impacted their patients and communities. This comes as a physician group, No License for Disinformation, and their calls for state medical board to take disciplinary action against physicians who deliberately spread misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic gain more traction.

WHO Issues Situation Report on the Russo-Ukrainian War

As the news has been filled with reports of Russian attacks on civilians and healthcare institutions, including the bombing of a maternity ward and children’s hospital in Mariupol, the WHO has released its first situation report on Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion. The report indicates over 18 million of Ukraine’s population have been affected, including 1.2 million refugees, 160,000 internally displaced person, at least 553 civilian injuries, and 249 civilian deaths. It notes that conflict related trauma and injuries are currently exacerbated by a lack of access to healthcare facilities as well as a lack of medicine and supplies. Importantly, it also explains there is an excess of morbidity and death from common illnesses such as noncommunicable diseases (such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, etc.) and acute maternal, newborn, and child illnesses. The spread of infectious diseases is on the rise in Ukraine as well, including COVID-19, measles, polio, TB, HIV and diarrheal diseases. This is due to widespread destruction of water and sanitation infrastructure, inadequate vaccination coverage, lack of access to medicines and medical care, safe water, adequate sanitation and hygiene as well as population movements and crowding. Ukraine faced a polio outbreak and was just pulling out of weeks of record high COVID-19 case counts when Russia invaded on 24 February. Ukraine has a relatively low vaccination rate and the government was struggling with vaccine hesitancy prior to the invasion. The WHO is continuing to monitor the situation and trying to help the Ukrainian Ministry of Health in coordinating the health response.

World Surpasses 6 Million COVID-19 Deaths As the Pandemic Drags On

The pandemic is very much not over, with the world surpassing 6.03 million official COVID-19 deaths Thursday. Worse yet, these are only confirmed deaths, with the true count likely being much higher. This horror is inescapable in places like Hong Kong right now, where the death count is continuing to soar as officials race to test all 7.5 million Hong Kongers three times this month to try and maintain the mainland’s zero-COVID strategy. Death rates also remain high in Poland, Hungary, Romania, and other Eastern European countries, which does not bode well with over 1 million Ukrainian refugees flooding in to these places. Despite this, a 136-page report written by two dozen experts, many of whom advised President Biden, was released this week entitled, “Getting to and Sustaining the Next Normal: A Roadmap to Living with Covid.” This report argues the US pandemic response should shift from being focused only on COVID-19 to focusing on a system where prevention, mitigation, and treatment efforts are focused on a number of respiratory illnesses, including influenza and COVID-19. They do stress this “next normal” will not be like 2019, but that this is how to best deal with pandemic fatigue and more diverse health threats as case counts in the US decline.

US Intelligence Community Releases Annual Threat Assessment

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) has released its unclassified 2022 Annual Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community (IC). This year’s assessment includes an entire section dedicated to health security, covering infectious diseases and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, biological weapons, and anomalous health incidents (AHIs). Key assessments include that the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to continue to strain health systems, possibly aiding the spread of other diseases; that countries around the world remain vulnerable to the emergence of a new novel pathogen that could cause a worse pandemic; that economic fallout from the pandemic will continue to challenge governments and hinder human development, particularly in the developing world; and that shortcomings in pandemic response may inspire adversaries to consider developing or using biological weapons.

The brief sub-section on biological weapons assesses, “Global shortcomings in preparedness for the pandemic and questions surrounding the origins of the COVID-19

virus and biosecurity may inspire some adversaries to consider options related to biological weapons developments.” It states that advances in dual-use technology like bioinformatics, synthetic biology, and genomic editing, could help enable the development of new bioweapons that are able to complicate detection, attribution, and treatment. It also addresses ongoing efforts by China, Iran, and Russia to tout their individual and collaborative efforts to improve biosecurity while also making false claims about US laboratories pertaining to the origin of COVID-19, biosafety breaches, vaccines, and bioweapons. It concludes that this messaging will likely be amplified ahead of the Review Conference of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, which is held every five years and is schedule to convene in mid-2022.

The sub-section on AHIs states that, “IC agencies assess with varying levels of confidence that most reported health incidents can be explained by medical conditions, or environmental or technical factors and that it is unlikely that a foreign actor—including Russia—is conducting a sustained, worldwide campaign involving hundreds of incidents without detection.” This is in reference to reports of Havana Syndrome, a condition first reported in 2016 by US and Canadian diplomats serving in Cuba with symptoms including ringing in the ears, vertigo and nausea, and cognitive difficulties. There are a number of speculations about what caused this, including theories that the Russians are using electromagnetic energy and ultrasound to target US and Canadian personnel.

This section of the threat assessment also summarizes some of the findings of 2021’s Updated Assessment on COVID-19 Origins, indicating that four IC elements assess with low confidence that SARS-CoV-2 was a result of zoonotic spillover while one assesses with moderate confidence that it was the result of a laboratory-associated incident. The same assessment also addressed concerns the virus was a bioweapons or genetically engineered, writing “We judge the virus was not developed as a biological weapon. Most agencies also assess with low confidence that SARS-CoV-2 probably was not genetically engineered; however, two agencies believe there was not sufficient evidence to make an assessment either way. Finally, the IC assesses China’s officials did not have foreknowledge of the virus before the initial outbreak of COVID-19 emerged.”

Three reports that Nature announced in February 2022 discussing SARS-CoV-2 origins have caused quite a stir recently as well. Two of the reports traced the original outbreak of COVID-19 back to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which sold live animals, in Wuhan, Hubei Province. A third report suggests that SARS-CoV-2 did spill over from animals- potentially those at the Huanan Market- to humans at least twice in November and December 2019. These reports include genetic analyses of samples collected from the market and infected people in December 2019 and January 2020 in addition to geolocation analyses connecting many of the samples to a specific portion of the market where live animals were sold. Important to note, however, is that these are still preprints and have not yet been published in peer-reviewed journals, though some argue they do add more weight to the idea that the pandemic started at the Huanan Market despite not being definitive.

GAO’s Chris P. Currie Testifies Before Senate Committee on Opportunities to Improve National Biodefense Strategy and Implementation

The Director of Homeland Security and Justice at the Government Accountability Office, Chris Currie, testified before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs on Opportunities to Address National Strategy and Programmatic Challenges pertaining to biodefense. His testimony addressed GAO studies in this area from December 2009 through August 2021, focused on efforts to implement the National Biodefense Strategy and strengthen biodefense preparedness, as well as ongoing challenges to DHS’s biosurveillance and biodetection efforts. Currie stated that GAO determined the US lacks “a set of defined capabilities for responding to nationally significant biological incidents, an interagency process for assessing and communicating exercise priorities, an interagency process for agencies to consistently report on the

capabilities exercised in after-action reviews, and routine monitoring at the interagency level of exercises and real-world incidents in order to evaluate lessons learned across the government, identify patterns and possible root causes for systemic challenges, and make recommendations to address these challenges.” He also discussed pathways to changing the National Biosurveillance Integration Center’s charge, DHS’s struggles to justify updating detection systems rendering it over-focused on aerosolized attacks, and how DHS can mitigate risk in Biological Detection for the 21st Century (BD21) acquisition.

Global Pandemic Preparedness Summit Sees CEPI Secure $1.5 Billion in Funding

The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) secured $1.535 billion in funding over the course of the UK’s Global Pandemic Preparedness Summit this week. This is in support of CEPI’s goal of being able to produce a new vaccine for newly detected COVID-19 variants within 100 days of detection. This 100 day goal relies on accelerating global genomic surveillance to quickly identify new pandemic threats. The UK pledged $211 million, Indonesia (current G20 President) gave $5 million, and the US pledged $150 million, among other donations from other top donors including the governments of Japan, Norway, Germany, and Australia, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and Wellcome. This did not fully cover CEPI’s goal of $3.5 billion over the next five years, though it certainly puts them well on their way. According to CEPI’s statement, “CEPI’s plan will reduce the risk posed by epidemics and pandemics by developing vaccines for known disease threats (such as Lassa fever, MERS and Nipah virus), and build on the scientific advances made during COVID-19 to prepare in advance for ‘Disease X’- the threat of an unknown pathogen with pandemic potential.” Read USAID Administrator Samantha Power’s statement on the funding and push to deploy new vaccines for new COVID-19 variants within 100 days of detection here.

RUSI Occasional Paper- Remote Assessment of North Korea’s Chemical Weapons, Feasible or Not?

The Royal United Services Institute has released a new report, “Remote Assessment of North Korea’s Chemical Weapons, Feasible or Not?” discussing how open source research and remote sensing technologies might be used to assess North Korea’s CW capability. To do this, the authors use a case study approach focusing on the Namhung Youth Chemical Complex in South Pyongan Province. Their research process included gathering data and information to build a case study that could be used to test this approach, analysis and assessment of the chemical activities and determination of whether those activities have relevance for CW production, and analysis of the overlap between the signatures of chemical activity and CW specifics at the Namhung Complex, followed by examination of how remote sensing might be able to support further assessment of CW capability. They conclude that the Namhung Complex is not a site used purely for CW production, but that it does likely retain activities relevant for CW. They determine for an open-source approach to be of the most value, the method would have to be replicated across the DPRK’s chemical industry. Furthermore, they state analyses should consider CW production as a network instead of focusing too much on individual sites. They conclude that, “…while remote sensing tools will not be a silver bullet in assessing the status, scope and scale of North Korea’s CW programme, they can be used to refine hypotheses about North Korea’s CW capability.”

APIC Releases New Recommendations for Balancing Patient Safety and Pandemic Response

The Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC) has released its new call to action, “Between a Rock and a Hard Place: Recommendations for Balancing Patient Safety and Pandemic Response, a Call to Action on Improving our National Strategy for Pandemic Preparedness and Patient Safety”. It outlines a number of recommendations and steps to implement them including: developing next-generation universal personal protective equipment; normalizing the use of masks by the general public during times of increased infectious disease threats; addressing supply chain failures, including personnel with IPC expertise on healthcare system incident command and emergency response teams; putting properly trained personnel in long-term care, nursing homes, and other high-risk settings; building and implementing infection prevention and control surge capacity; increasing capacity for testing and contact tracing; ensuring rapid data sharing and interoperability around infection surveillance data; establishing strategies and actions to build disease confidence; and funding pandemic preparedness workforce capacity training.

CFR- The COVID-19 Pandemic and China’s Global Health Leadership

Dr. Yanzhong Huang, Senior Fellow for Global Health at the Council on Foreign Relations, has released this new CFR report discussing China’s attempts to gain prominence in global health leadership and opportunities for the United States to re-assert itself in this area. In it he discusses China’s earlier attempts to turn its comparative success in managing COVID-19 into taking center stage in global leadership. However, he explains that its initial mishandling of the outbreak undermined the country’s international reputation, harming its ability to project soft power and strengthen its international image. Recent developments with highly transmissible variants have also challenged China’s draconian outbreak response measures and called into questions the efficacy of Chinese vaccines. He cautions the country is also heading towards a wider immunity gap between its population and the rest of the world, writing “The zero-COVID strategy will be extremely costly and highly dangerous: a small omicron outbreak in China could quickly develop into multiple larger outbreaks across the country, sending shock waves through society and the economy and intensifying the disruption of global supply chains and inflation pressures worldwide.” He concludes with a number of recommendations for the Biden administration, urging that the US should cooperate with Beijing in this area when it is helpful (such as in disease surveillance, response capacity-building, and vaccine distribution) while also scaling up US health diplomacy efforts and forming a bloc with allies to increase the WHO’s authority. This report is available here from CFR.

Insidious Insights: Implications of Viral Vector Engineering for Pathogen Enhancement

Biodefense Graduate Program Director, Dr. Gregory Koblentz, has co-authored this new article in Gene Therapy. In it, the authors discuss how viral vector engineering offers enormous benefits, but brings a dual use risk pertaining to pathogen enhancement. They explain that optimizing viral vectors and their properties will prove important for improving the effectiveness and safety of clinical gene therapy, but there are particular risks in which reliable and generalizable methods of immune evasion could increase viral fitness, potentially causing a new pandemic. They write, “High potential for misuse is associated with (1) the development of universal genetic elements for immune modulation, (2) specific insights on capsid engineering for antibody evasion applicable to viruses with pandemic potential, and (3) the development of computational methods to inform capsid engineering.” They explain a number of ways this could be mitigated, including prioritizing non-viral delivery systems, before concluding with recommendations about how this data should be published until a technical solution for preventing malicious access to these viral engineering tools is established.

Kremlin fury at FSB errors that put occupation strategy in peril

President Putin’s security service failed to use encrypted communications in Ukraine, allowing battlefield messages to be intercepted with ease by Kyiv.

The FSB, one of the successor agencies to the KGB, is being blamed in part for Russia’s stuttering invasion of Ukraine, according to security experts, with President Putin, director of the FSB from 1998-99, said to be furious at inaccurate intelligence he has received.

The FSB, which specialises in sowing political instability, has hundreds of agents throughout the country, using tactical groups to intimidate civilians in occupied areas, the Ukrainian military said.

However, it has been exposed for numerous failings. These include a case when an FSB officer, embedded with the 41st army outside Kharkiv, phoned a colleague in Russia to report the death of General Vitaly Gerasimov this week.

Rather than using the FSB’s secure communication channel, called Era, introduced with much fanfare last year, they were speaking using normal SIM cards on mobile phones. Gerasimov, 45, was killed outside the besieged eastern city, along with other senior officers. The call was intercepted by Kyiv.

“It is not a competent organisation,” said Andrei Soldatov, co-founder and editor of Agentura, an investigative website that has monitored the Russian secret services for more than 20 years.

“The final reports that they produced on the situation on the ground in the run-up to the invasion were simply not right, which is part of the reason why things have gone so badly for Russia.”

The primary responsibilities of the FSB are internal and include everything from counterterrorism to border security. Over recent years its fiefdom has expanded and it is also responsible for monitoring the countries of the former Soviet Union.

At the height of its powers, the KGB was among the most formidable intelligence agencies in the world, a weapon of the state wielded to promote the Soviet Union’s interests. Since then experts say that Russian intelligence has suffered a precipitous fall.

From 2014 the agency spent a lot of time and resources on attempts to foment unrest in western Ukraine among far-right groups, which ultimately came to nothing, Soldatov said. Their assessments of popular support among Ukrainians for a Russian invasion and the extent to which the country would resist were also “terribly miscalculated”.

Soldatov said: “We can’t rule out the fact that the intelligence they gathered on the ground was in fact very good. The problem is that it is too risky for superiors to tell Putin what he doesn’t want to hear, so they tailor their information.”

Public embarrassments involving FSB officers over recent days have provided further humiliation. Last weekend an alleged report written by an officer emerged, complaining of overwork and meaningless “box-ticking exercises” that had left the country woefully unprepared for western sanctions.

During periods of crisis, agents are often required to sleep in the Lubyanka, the Moscow headquarters of the FSB that also served as the KGB’s head office.

“When I speak to FSB officers, they are not doing it because of a big idea. It’s always because they are complaining about something relatively trivial,” Soldatov said. “They are narrow-minded people. They are not like MI6 officers who have been to Cambridge and are supposedly the cream of the crop. They have left school and been educated at the FSB academy. They often go into it because their father and grandfather had also been an intelligence officer – it’s well-paid and they give you an apartment.”

Philip Ingram, a security expert and former senior British intelligence officer, said the FSB had also attached its officers to each military unit to act as a “political commissar”.

Ingram said: “They will be making sure that there is no dissent and that the party line is being followed, scaring the commanders and therefore the troops on the ground.

“The FSB is still a relatively old-fashioned organisation trying to play espionage the old-fashioned way. They will be smarting at the moment as Putin is very angry. You can see it in his body language, the way he is gesturing, the terminology he is using. He blames them for feeding him the advice that led to the poor decision-making in Ukraine.”",https://discourse.bomberblitz.com/t/russia-invades-ukraine/24814/4435

The purpose of these activities remains unknown, as authorities continue to actively suppress the truth of what happened in the 1960s and early 1970s. The startling exposé is based on the work of documentarian Per Wennick, who was one of 311 participants in the mysterious trials. The children never learned the objective of the tortuous assessments to which they were exposed, even after they ended. Such trials are in conflict with the Nuremberg Code, which enforces the vital requirement of obtaining consent from human subjects in all medical research. According to Wennick, when he was 11 years old, he was asked at an authoritarian orphanage in Copenhagen if he wanted to try something “fun” at the local municipal hospital. It was vaguely described as an examination of how children “feel”. Believing it would be a welcome diversion, he acquiesced and even received a small sum for his participation. Wennick went on to undergo a series of regular tests, which included being forced to listen to recordings on headphones of loud noises, screams, and statements intended to scare him. Staff strapped him to a chair while electrodes were placed on his arms, legs, and chest, measuring his heart rate, temperature, and sweat levels. These experiments continued until 1973, when Wennick was 24-years-old. However, a decade later, while in a hospital due to a skin complaint, he learned his visit—in fact, his every contact with healthcare services— was reported to the Danish Psychological Institute for reasons never made clear to him. Fast forward to 2018. While at a film festival in the United States, he saw the documentary “Three Identical Strangers,” which tells the story of triplets deliberately separated at birth and offered up for adoption to families of differing socioeconomic backgrounds, in a covert and highly unethical scientific “nature versus nurture” study. It occurred to Wennick he too may have been unwittingly caught up in a similar experiment. The Search For More Records On Human Experiments Diligent digging in local archives unearthed a number of papers revealing that the project in which Wennick became embroiled was the brainchild of Zarnoff A. Mednick, a U.S. psychologist interested in what distinguishes schizophrenic patients from neurotypical people and patients with other disorders. Denmark was an attractive testing ground. Unlike the U.S., it boasted a central population register, meaning participants could be tracked over the course of many years. Mednick collaborated with Danish professor Fini Schulsinger, constructing a study of 207 children with schizophrenic mothers, and a control group of 104 children without schizophrenic mothers, including Wennick. He sought to ascertain how many would develop schizophrenia and how it might manifest. Over a third of the participants were orphans. In 1977, Schulsinger published a doctoral dissertation on the project. Denmark’s Ministry of Justice intervened to ensure, contrary to standard practice, he was not required to undertake a ‘viva,’ which is a public defence of his thesis. That kept the survey’s background a secret. Having piqued his curiosity, Wennick went off in search of more records related to the experiments. Eventually, he identified 36 boxes of material stored in the basement of a psychiatric center in a Copenhagen suburb. He asked Josef Parnas, a psychiatrist he interviewed for his documentary series, to assist him. But when the center learned of his request, it began shredding the documents, on the alleged basis it was unable to store research papers after a project’s conclusion. This may have been a violation of Danish law.. There are further reasons to doubt the psychiatric center’s stated rationale. The project was lavishly funded and received around $700,000 when adjusted for inflation. Roughly a quarter of that money flowed from the Human Ecology Fund, a CIA front and outgrowth of QKHILLTOP, one of a cluster of mind control programs launched by the agency in the 1950s to study alleged communist brainwashing techniques and develop interrogation strategies. It was eventually absorbed into the notorious MKULTRA. This may explain why, along with invasive and cruel psychological exams, the Danish children were also subject to extensive physiological and mental assessments. In one of the Fund’s experiments, participants had to agree or disagree with around 600 different statements, a test originally designed to screen soldiers for fascist sympathies around World War II. https://shadowproof.com/2022/01/26/cia-funded-experiments-on-danish-orphans-for-decades/ Disclaimer: this post and the subject matter and contents thereof - text, media, or otherwise - do not necessarily reflect the views of the 8kun administration.

Anonymous 03/10/22 (Thu) 17:38:20 b9a96d No.15829553 >>15829544 Scant information is available publicly on QKHILLTOP’s dimensions even today, although an academic paper published in June 2007 shed significant light on the Human Ecology Fund’s cloak-and-dagger activities. Originally named the Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology, it was founded in 1954 by Harold G. Wolff. A renowned neurologist and leading authority on stress, migraines, and bio-physiological mechanisms of human pain, he was personally recruited for the project by CIA chief Allen Dulles, who fostered business in Adolf Hitler’s Germany. Thereafter, the Society provided sizable financing to social scientists and medical researchers, primarily in furtherance of the CIA’s behavior modification and persuasion goals. They also identified “specific cultural information” about Cold War enemy populations, such as China or Russia. Sexuality was a subject of intense study. “Both pleasure and pain were areas of interest for those studying interrogation,” the paper recorded. Projects were awarded smaller grants that likely had no intelligence or national security applications but provided the organization with “a necessary false appearance of legitimacy for the public and the academic community,” such as studies on cranial analysis and Puerto Rican migration. ‘Becoming More Childlike’ A 1963 CIA Inspector General review of MKULTRA opaquely noted that in certain cases academics employed under its auspices “may be aware of our interest” in a research program. It added “experience has shown that qualified, competent individuals in the field of pharmacological, physiological, psychiatric, and other biological sciences are most reluctant to enter into signed agreements of any sort which connect them with this activity, since such a connection would jeopardize their professional reputations.” Langley got around this problem by simply keeping most participating scientists in the dark as to the agency’s role in commissioning the research program. They hoodwinked scientists and hid the malign purposes behind their labor. For example, in the late 1950s the Human Ecology Fund bankrolled a trip to Nigeria for psychiatrist Raymond Prince to undertake “transcultural psychological studies.” Prince had no idea the CIA intended for his work to “add somewhat to our understanding of native Yoruba psychiatry, including the use of drugs, many of which are unknown or not much used by Western practitioners.” and “assist in the identification of promising young [redacted] who may be of direct interest to the agency.” He later concluded that overseas trips sponsored by the Fund were attempts to recruit foreign nationals and collect data “on cultures and countries of interest to the CIA for psychological warfare purposes.” Seemingly innocuous surveys of the personality types and family structure of Chinese nationals residing in the U.S. could be maliciously exploited, “to identify disgruntled refugees with suitable personality profiles who had fled the communist regime 10 years earlier and might be persuaded to act as CIA agents back in China.” Research findings from the Fund’s assorted initiatives furthermore appear to have provided major components of the CIA’s 1963 KUBARK interrogation manual, given that document, which advocates the use of electric shock, threats, fear, sensory deprivation and isolation, repeatedly cited the work of Human Ecology-supported scholars. As historian Alfred W. McCoy recorded, most confirmed MKULTRA research efforts did not actually relate to propaganda or brainwashing at all but involved physical and psychological torture techniques. It is, therefore, disturbing that the Fund’s 1961–1963 progress report lists several studies related to childhood, which it supported, such as “conceptual development in children and young adults.” This may relate to the KUBARK manual, given the document discusses how, when its assorted techniques are applied, “the usual effect…is regression,” and a subject’s “mature defenses crumbles [sic] as he becomes more childlike [emphasis added].” The CIA considered it “usually useful to intensify” such feelings. Did the Danish experiments inform CIA torture techniques, which were employed in recent years?

He helped hatch numerous assassination plots that targeted leaders in the Global South. A New York Times obituary quoted a nameless Langley operative as saying MKULTRA specifically targeted mental patients, prisoners, drug addicts, and prostitutes as “human guinea pigs.” They were considered good subjects because they were “people who could not fight back.” Altogether, Wennick’s investigation raises grim questions. Where else in the world might the CIA have supported unethical human experiments on vulnerable and defenseless youths, and why?

The image, posted Tuesday to commemorate International Women's Day, contained four images related to the current crisis in Ukraine, where a Russian military incursion was set to enter its third week. ""All women and girls must live free and equal. This international women's day we think of the remarkable women of #Ukraine,"" NATO tweeted alongside a Ukrainian flag emoji. ""Their strength, bravery and resilience are symbolic of the spirit of their nation #IWD2022."" The first of the four images included what appeared to be a Ukrainian servicemember bearing a ""Black Sun"" on the chest area of her military fatigues. The symbol, also known in German as ""Schwarze Sonne"" or ""Sonnenrad,"" is rooted in Nazi occultism and has been brandished by far-right elements across the globe, including in Ukraine, where it is featured on the official logo of the National Guard's Azov Regiment. The image first appeared to be shared on social media on February 14 by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and was later syndicated by a number of outlets and agencies, and was featured prominently on the front page of The Guardian the following day. The symbol itself, however, is not readily visible, as it is nearly the same color as the green camouflage of the soldier's uniform. Shortly after NATO shared the image, the symbol was noted by a number of social media users and then taken down swiftly. Reached for comment, a NATO official said the post was removed after the alliance first noticed the symbol. ""As part of an International Women's Day collage for social media, we posted an image from stock footage of an international agency,"" a NATO official told Newsweek. ""The post was removed when we realised it contained a symbol that we could not verify as official."" While closely associated with Nazism, the history of the Black Sun actually stems largely from the lore of the Third Reich that lingered long after its fall. As to its actual meaning, Strube explained that the Black Sun ""can mean a lot of different things, but it is almost always situated within far-right and neo-Nazi contexts."" ""It can refer to a supposed 'Pagan' past allegedly linked to Nazism and the SS in particular,"" Strube said. ""As such, it might be related to Norse or Slavic Neo-Perunism with a far-right thrust — or it may simply serve as a substitute for the Nazi swastika, which is outlawed in several countries."" In the context of Ukraine, where official symbols of both Nazism and communism were declared illegal in 2015, Strube said that the Black Sun is ""most likely related or refers to the Azov Battalion, which used it among its insignia."" Mark Pitcavage, senior fellow at the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism, also noted how the Azov Regiment ""has incorporated it into their logo.""

We heard on Tuesday from the US State Department that there were US Biolabs in Ukraine. Then on Wednesday the Biden regime backtracked and insisted there were no US-funded Biolabs in Ukraine. Why the sudden confusing messaging from the Biden gang? Especially when there are documents that prove the US was funding several of the Biolabs they set up in Ukraine to study potentially dangerous pathogens. It may be because Hunter Biden’s firm Rosemont Seneca was funding the firms involved in the building of these labs in Ukraine and they felt this was not something they wanted the American people to know. InfoWars put together an excellent article with connections between Hunter Biden and the firm Metabiota, which was involved in the creation of Biolabs in Ukraine. The Gateway Pundit identified through the Wayback Machine that Rosemont Seneca provided capital (invested in) Metabiota as noted on the firm’s website back in 2014. It is listed as “Our Team’s Investments” on the Rosemont Senaca webpage. We also located a number of documents from the Wayback Machine (meaning they have been since deleted off the Internet) that show the Department of Defense investing in the creation of Biolabs in Ukraine with the help of firm Black & Veatch. Here is a sample of one of the documents located.

The dog handler, Rasmus Alpsjö, was part of a rotation of young Swedish men hired to care for Maxwell’s Vizsla, Captain Nemo. And he claims that Borgerson, tall and with an iron grip, was particularly intimidating. “He sat me down and he told me, like, ‘The woman that you’re working for, living with, she’s a very famous woman. So you can never say who she is, and you can never bring people to the house and you have to be quiet about all this,’” Alpsjö said. The alleged encounter is featured in a new episode of actress and filmmaker Raeden Greer’s podcast Diaries of a Pretender, which delves into her friend Alpsjö’s brief stint as Maxwell’s pet minder, hamburger griller, and fetcher of Starbucks coffee. Alpsjö’s interview offers a rare glimpse into Maxwell’s world just before she swapped New York for Massachusetts in order to live with Borgerson. The socialite and those in her circle were paranoid about strangers and media appearing at her Upper East Side townhouse, he said. On one occasion, Alpsjö claims, Maxwell became enraged after he allowed a delivery man to enter her home. “She's just like, ‘Who is this?’ And ‘gimme your ID.’ And then she took the delivery guy’s ID, like took a copy of it,” Alpsjö said, adding that “when she told him to leave, ’cause he was at the wrong door, she was furious at me.” When Alpsjö first met Maxwell, the socialite supposedly asked him, “Do you have a passport?” Alpsjö considered this might be a trick question but answered yes. “Now you have two passports,” Maxwell allegedly said. “You have to register on my website, the TerraMar Project, and you will get the second passport.” (She was referring to her oceans nonprofit’s site which allowed supporters to become “citizens” of the high seas.) Alpsjö separately shared with Greer and The Daily Beast a photo of another item someone showed him in Maxwell’s residence: A signed copy of former President Bill Clinton’s autobiography My Life. The inscription reads, “To Ghislaine with love.” Disclaimer: this post and the subject matter and contents thereof - text, media, or otherwise - do not necessarily reflect the views of the 8kun administration.

Bloomberg reports that the company said Thursday in an emailed statement: “Goldman Sachs is winding down its business in Russia in compliance with regulatory and licensing requirements. We are focused on supporting our clients across the globe in managing or closing out pre-existing obligations in the market and ensuring the well-being of our people.” The closing of the office is more symbolic than anything else as Bloomberg notes that at the end of 2021, the firm’s total credit exposure to Russia was $650 million, most of which was tied to non-sovereign counterparties or borrowers. Additionally, Goldman will continue to make markets in Russian corporate debt but will not take positions… “In our role as market-maker standing between buyers and sellers, we are helping our clients reduce their risk in Russian securities which trade in the secondary market, not seeking to speculate.” We suspect Goldman will not be the last as Citi has already announced it is 'assessing operations' in Russia https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/goldman-becomes-first-major-bank-abandon-russia Disclaimer: this post and the subject matter and contents thereof - text, media, or otherwise - do not necessarily reflect the views of the 8kun administration.

The two superyachts, which together span almost 1,000 feet (or 305 meters) and cost well over $1 billion, are now at sea following the recent blocking of vessels owned by Russian tycoons Alisher Usmanov, Igor Sechin, Alexey Mordashov and Gennady Timchenko. All of them were sanctioned by the European Union and had ships docked at various ports within the bloc. Abramovich’s 533-foot Eclipse left St. Martin in the Caribbean a week ago, beginning a transatlantic passage, and was north of the Canary Islands as of 11:23ET. His newer superyacht, the 458-foot Solaris, departed Barcelona on Tuesday after spending most of the winter in the Spanish port and is off the southern coast of Sicily, heading east. Neither the Solaris nor the Eclipse list a destination in their data, according to a Bloomberg report. * * * Following a handful of asset seizures in Italy, Switzerland, and France that prompted some wealthy Russian businessmen to rapidly move yachts, jets, and other billionaire flotsam, the UK is cracking down and seizing assets belonging to more than half-a-dozen oligarchs. UK authorities are sanctioning all assets of Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich as well as six other Russians. They will all face the full asset freeze and travel ban which could leave them effectively trapped where they are. The British said the total value of the sanctions is approximately £15 billion ($19.74 billion). https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/uk-disrupts-sale-chelsea-fc-new-sanctions-abramovich-others Disclaimer: this post and the subject matter and contents thereof - text, media, or otherwise - do not necessarily reflect the views of the 8kun administration.

Newsmax reported: United Airlines Holdings Inc. will allow workers who have not been vaccinated against COVID-19 for religious or medical reasons to return at the end of this month, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. The move permits staffers with exemptions from the carrier’s vaccination requirement for its U.S. employees to return from unpaid leave or from the non-customer-facing roles they were allowed to apply for as an alternative to their regular jobs, the report said.

When he was getting discharged, they told him his life expectancy in that M.O.S. was 1 minute. He was lost in the jungle alone for a week after chopper crash. He was an “unofficial” POW for a few days and was part of an illegal and unofficial trade between the U.S. and the VC. He once met U.S. Senator Jesse Helms (N.C.) and gave him his medals and told Senator Helms to tell LBJ to shove them up his ass. Senator Helms graciously agreed but I doubt he actually did that.

Anonymous 03/10/22 (Thu) 17:54:46 5c6d91 No.15829680 House Passes $1.5 Trillion Spending Bill With $13.6 Billion For Ukraine The U.S. House of Representatives voted on Wednesday to pass a $1.5 trillion omnibus spending bill that includes $13.6 billion in aid for Ukraine and European allies, and would fund the federal government through to Sept. 30. Hours earlier, Democratic lawmakers scrapped the bill’s initial $15.6 billion COVID-19 aid provision, marking a major setback for the Biden administration who had pushed for weeks to have the additional funds approved. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called the decision to abandon the provision “heartbreaking.” Republicans had demanded cuts to state aid to fund the new initiative. “We’ve got a war going on in Ukraine,” Pelosi told reporters, explaining the urgency Democrats felt in making concessions in bargaining with Republicans. “We have important work that we’re doing here.” She said with her party in the 50-50 Senate needing at least 10 GOP votes to pass legislation, Democrats “are going to have to know there has to be compromise.” The overall bill was approved by the House in two separate votes. The measure’s security programs were overwhelmingly approved by 361-69, the rest by 260-171, with most Republicans opposed. The Ukraine aid included $6.5 billion for the U.S. costs of sending troops and weapons to Eastern Europe and equipping allied forces there in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion, which he launched on Feb. 24. A further $6.8 billion would go toward care for refugees and provide economic aid to allies, and more to help federal agencies enforce economic sanctions against Russia and protect against cyber threats at home. The figure is higher than the sum initially requested by the Biden administration, $6.5 billion, and the $10 billion figure in the White House’s formal request to Congress. On Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Congress’s aid package for Ukraine and its Eastern European allies stood at $14 billion. He criticized the speed at which the aid package has moved along. Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), the GOP leader on the House Rules Committee, called the $1.5 trillion bill a “reasonable compromise” and said its extra defense spending was “clearly necessary in the wake of Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked aggression against Ukraine.” Some $730 billion has also been allocated for military spending under the Defense Department, and a further $125 billion would go to the Department of Veterans Affairs. The bill would increase spending for child nutrition and child care, local law enforcement, improving broadband in rural areas, and education aid for disabled students and historically black colleges and universities. The spending bill still needs to be passed by the Senate. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) has said he hopes to pass the legislation before Friday to avert a government shutdown. https://www.zerohedge.com/political/house-passes-15-trillion-spending-bill-136-billion-ukraine Disclaimer: this post and the subject matter and contents thereof - text, media, or otherwise - do not necessarily reflect the views of the 8kun administration.

Anonymous 03/10/22 (Thu) 17:56:55 5c6d91 No.15829699 Ukraine Government Plans to Move Sensitive Data and Servers Overseas if Russia Further Advances into the Country The Ukrainian government is considering a possible transfer of its sensitive data and servers abroad if the Russian army further advances into the country, Reuters reported on Wednesday. This comes after the Director of the Information and Press Department of Russian Federation, Maria Vladimirovna Zakharova, claimed they had seized biological material found in Ukraine bio labs. Both the US and Ukraine denied these allegations. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Wednesday that reports of biolabs in Ukraine were fake news propagated by Russia. Due to grave threats from Russian forces, Victor Zhora, the deputy chief of Ukraine’s State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection, is planning a contingency plan to move its critical information and servers out of Ukraine. Zhora shared that some countries were already offering to host data without mentioning the names of the countries. Reuters reported: The Ukrainian government is preparing for the potential need to move its data and servers abroad if Russia’s invading forces push deeper into the country, a senior cyber-security official told Reuters on Wednesday. Mr Victor Zhora, the deputy chief of Ukraine’s State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection, emphasised his department was planning for a contingency, but that it is being considered at all suggests Ukrainians want to be ready for any Russian threat to seize sensitive government documents. “We are preparing the ground,” Mr Zhora said. Plan A was to protect information technology infrastructure within Ukraine. Removing it to another country would only be a “plan B or C”. The move could only happen after regulatory changes approved by Ukrainian lawmakers, Mr Zhora said. Government officials have already been shipping equipment and backups to more secure areas of Ukraine beyond the reach of Russian forces, which invaded on Feb 24 and are laying siege to several cities. Last month, Mr Zhora told the journal Politico that there were plans to move critical data out of the capital Kyiv should it be threatened, but preparations for potentially moving data abroad go a step further. Ukraine has received offers to host data from a variety of countries, Mr Zhora said, declining to identify them. For reasons of proximity, “a European location will be preferred”, he said. “There are a lot options,” he said. “All the proposals are highly welcome and worth considering.” Mr Zhora gave few details of how such a move might be executed, but he said past efforts to keep government data out of Russia’s grasp involved either the physical transport of servers and removable storage devices or the digital migration of data from one service or server to another. https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2022/03/ukraine-government-plans-move-sensitive-data-servers-overseas-russia-advances-country/ Disclaimer: this post and the subject matter and contents thereof - text, media, or otherwise - do not necess",https://8kun.top/qresearch/res/15829490.html
