The images released by Maxar Technologies, a space technology company, showed a large deployment of Russian ground troops moving in the direction of the Ukrainian capital from approximately 40 miles (64 km) away.

The deployment consisted of hundreds of military vehicles and extended more than 3.25 miles (5 km), Maxar said.

The convoy was situated northeast of the Ukrainian city of Ivankiv and contained fuel, logistics and armored vehicles including tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and self-propelled artillery.

Maxar has been tracking the buildup of Russian forces for weeks.

This development comes as the European Union took the unprecedented step of supplying weapons to Ukraine, which is the first time the bloc has financed the purchase and delivery of weapons for a country that is under attack.

Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, called the step a ""watershed moment"" and also announced that the bloc will also close its airspace to Russian airlines.
