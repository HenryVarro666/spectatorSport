Russian and Ukrainian delegations wrap up face-to-face talks in Istanbul.

Moscow says it will “fundamentally cut back” offensive operations near Kyiv and Chernihiv in order to boost “trust” in further discussions between Russia and Ukraine.

Kyiv offers neutrality in exchange for security guarantees, proposes resolving the dispute over Crimea within 15 years via “bilateral negotiations”.

Russia’s promise to scale down military operations does not represent a ceasefire, Moscow’s lead negotiator in talks with Ukraine has said.

“We believe any movement of Russian forces from around Kyiv is a redeployment, not a withdrawal. And the world should be prepared for continued major offensives against other areas of Ukraine,” the official said, adding: “They are shifting gears… No one should mistake that for Russia ending the conflict.”

Blinken says no signs Russia serious about peace efforts

Secretary of State Antony Blinken says the United States has not seen any evidence indicating talks between Moscow and Kyiv were progressing in a “constructive way”.

He also warned Russian indications of a pullback could be an attempt by Moscow to “deceive people and deflect attention”, before calling on Russia to end its aggression immediately and pull its forces back.

“There is what Russia says and there is what Russia does, and we’re focused on the latter,” Blinken said during a visit to Morocco. “And what Russia is doing is the continued brutalisation of Ukraine.”

He added that Russian officials were “profoundly fooling themselves… if they somehow believe that an effort to subjugate only the eastern part of Ukraine or the southern part of Ukraine… can succeed”.

Can Russia return to the world stage?

The war in Ukraine has turned Russian President Vladimir Putin into a pariah – at least in the West.

But at the same time, Russia remains a member of the United Nations Security Council, while powerful countries on the global stage, such as China and India, have not moved to condemn Moscow.

And analysts say that while Putin may be viewed as reprehensible now amid Ukraine’s war, casting Russia aside long-term looks unlikely because of the country’s strategic power.

Many European states expel Russian envoys over ‘espionage’

Several European Union member states have moved to expel Russian nationals accused of spying for Moscow while posing as diplomats.

The Dutch foreign ministry said it had ordered 17 alleged Russian intelligence agents who were accredited as diplomats to leave the country, while Belgian Foreign Minister Sophie Wilmes announced her country had moved to banish 21 Russian diplomats on espionage charges.

Ireland, too, announced it was expelling four Russian diplomats and the Czech Republic gave one member of Russia’s embassy in Prague 72 hours to leave the country.

“Together with our allies, we are reducing the Russian intelligence presence in the EU,” the Czech foreign ministry tweeted.

UK detains Russian-owned superyacht in ‘warning’ to Putin

The United Kingdom’s government says it has detained a 38 million pounds ($49.6m) superyacht owned by a Russian businessman which was docked in London’s Canary Wharf financial district.

The 58.5-metre (192 feet) Dutch-built yacht, named Phi, was detained under the government’s sweeping sanctions on Russia, which include measures against scores of individuals and entities. It marked the first time the regulations have been used to detain a ship.

The government said Phi is owned by a Russian businessman but that ownership was “deliberately well hidden”, with the company the ship is registered to based in St Kitts and Nevis, and the ship carrying Maltese flags.

“Today we’ve detained a 38 million pound superyacht and turned an icon of Russia’s power and wealth into a clear and stark warning to Putin and his cronies,” Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said in a statement.

He added the war must end as soon as possible and noted that “more difficult issues” were expected to be discussed between the Ukrainian and Russian foreign ministers at a later date.

Russian announcement an indication of ‘major progress in talks’: AJE correspondent

Al Jazeera’s Hashem Ahelbarra, reporting from Moscow, says Russia’s announcement could be the “most significant by the Russian military” since Putin launched the invasion of Ukraine last month.

This is an indication “there has been major progress in the talks” between Moscow and Kyiv, Ahelbarra said.

He added the move would send a “message to the Ukrainians that Russia has no intentions whatsoever to mass troops or move troops in the future to try and take over Kyiv”.

Ukrainian official says guarantor states would ‘legally’ protect Ukraine from aggression

Mykhailo Podolyak, a political adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, says Ukraine’s proposal for security guarantees could involve several guarantor states such as the US, the UK, Turkey, France and Germany.

The countries would be “legally [and] actively involved in protecting [Ukraine] from any aggression” in terms similar to NATO’s Article 5 collective defence clause, Podolyak tweeted.

He added that the Ukrainian delegation had offered to settle the issue of the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, “exclusively through bilateral negotiations within 15 years”.

Briefly. Security guarantees treaty with an enhanced analogue of Article 5 of NATO. Guarantor states (USA, UK, Turkey, France, Germany etc.) legally actively involved in protecting 🇺🇦 from any aggression.

Russian negotiator says Istanbul talks were ‘constructive’

Medisnky has described the talks in Istanbul, which lasted for several hours, as “constructive”.

Russia’s chief negotiator said the proposals put forward by the Ukrainian side – including one that Russia would not oppose Ukraine joining the EU – would now be put to Putin for his consideration.

Russia to ‘cut back operations’ near Kyiv, Chernihiv to boost ‘trust’ in talks

Russia’s military claims it will “fundamentally cut back” operations near Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and the northern city of Chernihiv in order to boost talks between the two sides.

Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin said the move was meant “to increase trust” in the discussions aimed at ending the conflict and “create conditions for further negotiations”.

Ukraine’s military said it had noted withdrawals around Kyiv and Chernihiv.

Earlier on Tuesday, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said the main goal of Moscow’s offensive, which it describes as a “special military operation”, was to “liberate” eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region.

Kremlin says rules for gas payments in roubles being readied

The Kremlin has said Russia will work out practical arrangements by Thursday for foreign companies to pay for its gas in roubles. It added they needed to understand that Western “economic warfare” against Moscow had created a new set of market conditions.

“No one will supply gas for free, it is simply impossible, and you can pay for it only in roubles,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.

“All modalities are being developed so that this system is simple, understandable and feasible for respected European and international buyers,” he added.

Putin’s order last week to charge countries deemed “unfriendly” by Moscow in roubles for Russian gas has boosted the currency after it fell to all-time lows following Western powers’ rollout of sweeping sanctions over the attack on Ukraine.

The move drew strong criticism from European countries, which pay for Russian gas mostly in euros and say Russia is not entitled to redraw contracts.

Kremlin says Russia, US will need security dialogue ‘sooner or later’

The Kremlin has said Russia and the US will need to have a dialogue on security “sooner or later”, but warned the pair’s relations will inevitably be affected by remarks from Biden directed at Putin.

“Personal insults cannot but leave their mark on relations between heads of state,” Kremlin spokesman Peskov told reporters.

However, he added that “one way or another, sooner or later, we will have to speak about questions of strategic stability and security and so on”.

Biden has called Putin a “war criminal” and over the weekend said his Russian counterpart “cannot remain in power”.

‘Tension and panic’ in Mykolaiv: AJE correspondent

Al Jazeera’s Stefanie Dekker, reporting from Mykolaiv, says the city remains “very tense” after the alleged Russian attack on an administration building there.

“You can see a lot of the windows of the apartments here and in the surrounding area have been blown out,” Dekker said, reporting from the scene.

“We arrived here about an hour after that strike. There was another air raid siren and people were panicking. We saw rescue workers running away from the site, and then we all went into a shelter,” she added.

“We spoke to one lady who burst into tears, saying, ‘I cannot deal with this any more, it’s constant.’”

Mykolaiv is strategically located near Odesa, Ukraine’s largest port hub.

“It has held off a ground offensive for weeks but of course, Russia controls the skies and if it’s shelling, from the sea, from the ground, [and carrying out] air strikes … that does put ground troops at a disadvantage,” Dekker said.

UN nuclear watchdog chief in Ukraine to offer safety assistance

The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is in Ukraine for talks with senior government officials about ensuring the safety and security of its nuclear facilities, the UN’s nuclear watchdog has said.

Director General Rafael Grossi visit one of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants during his visit and is expected to hold a news conference when he returns to Vienna, where the IAEA has its headquarters, later this week.

“This conflict is already causing unimaginable human suffering and destruction,” he said in a statement. “The IAEA’s expertise and capabilities are needed to prevent it from also leading to a nuclear accident.”

Ukraine has 15 nuclear reactors at four active power plants, and is also home to the defunct Chernobyl facility, the site of a major nuclear disaster in 1986. Russian forces have taken control of Chernobyl and the Zaporizhzhia power plant, the largest in Europe.

ICRC calls for agreement on safe evacuations

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has called on Ukraine and Russia to reach a clear agreement for the safe evacuation of civilians from Mariupol and other places as vital supplies dwindle.

“Our concern is that the very intensity of the fighting is putting civilians in harm’s way,” Robert Mardini, the aid agency’s director general, told the Reuters news agency.

“The fact [is] that in places like Mariupol, civilians are not able to leave in safe conditions, there were no concrete agreements by parties to the conflict for [the] safe evacuation of civilians, nor has there been a green light to get humanitarian aid in,” he added, citing the besieged port city in southeastern Ukraine.

Mardini also said there was a “disinformation campaign” against the ICRC on social media as the aid agency moved to reject allegations it had taken part in the “forced evacuations of civilians to Russia” in a series of posts on Twitter.

Ukraine says three killed in attack on Mykolaiv administration building

At least three people have been killed and 22 others wounded in a Russian attack on a regional administration building in Mykolaiv, according to the country’s State Emergency Service.

The service said in a post on Facebook that search and rescue work was continuing at the scene. Al Jazeera was unable to independently verify the figures provided.

Regional Governor Vitaliy Kim said in a post on Telegram that a Russian rocket had “destroyed half of the building”.

Russian forces have attacked Ukraine’s southern ports, including Kherson, Odesa, Mykolaiv and Mariupol, as part of an apparent attempt to cut Ukraine’s access to the Black Sea and establish a land corridor from Russia to Crimea, the peninsula Moscow seized in 2014.

Abramovich attends Istanbul talks

Photos posted on Telegram by Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency appear to show Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich in attendance at the talks in Istanbul.

It was not immediately clear what role he was playing at the meeting, though the Chelsea Football Club owner is believed to be operating as a broker between Kyiv and Moscow.

Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, was quoted by RIA Novosti as saying that Abramovich’s participation in the talks on Tuesday had been approved by Moscow and Kyiv.

A spokesman for the 55-year-old, who has been sanctioned by the UK over his alleged close ties with Putin, has previously said his influence in negotiations to date between the two sides had been “limited”.

UN says it has helped up to 900,000 people in Ukraine so far

UN aid agencies have managed to help up to 900,000 people in Ukraine so far, but they must be guaranteed safe passage by the warring parties to be able to do more, a spokesman for the world body has said.

Jens Laerke, a spokesman for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), told a news briefing the number of people provided with assistance so far was “good but … far from enough”.

Ukraine’s Kuleba warns negotiators not to ‘eat or drink’ at talks after poisoning reports

Ukraine’s foreign minister has advised members of the Ukrainian delegation “not to eat or drink anything, and preferably avoid touching any surface” during their negotiations with Russian officials in Istanbul.

Dmytro Kuleba’s comments, given during an interview with Ukrainian news channel Ukrayina 24, came after reports on Monday suggested Abramovich and Ukrainian negotiators had suffered symptoms of suspected poisoning earlier this month.

But there is some scepticism over the incident. Shortly after the reports emerged, an unnamed US official was quoted by Reuters as saying that intelligence suggested the trio’s symptoms were due to “environmental” factors, not poisoning.

“It is in the hands of both sides to stop this tragedy,” he added.

Russia warns Poland to stay out of the Ukraine war

Poland has become vital in the Western effort to defend Ukraine, and some of the fighting is getting close to its border.

Last week, Russian forces targeted the western Ukrainian city of Lviv – near the Polish border, just as the US president was visiting Poland. The situation has forced NATO to decide on how to respond to such incidents within the borders of its member states.

So, is there a risk of a conflict spillover?

Asia complying with Russia export controls: US

A senior US official says Washington has not seen any indications of non-compliance in Asia with export controls on Russia.

“We certainly haven’t seen any indication that there’s non-compliance, in fact, we’ve seen the reverse,” said Matthew Borman, a deputy assistant secretary at the commerce department. “I think there’s also a fair amount of additional self-sanctioning, if you will, by multinational companies operating in Russia,” he added.

Major players know there is a significant risk to their business if they don’t comply, Borman said.

“We know that Russia is quite dependent upon foreign supplies for some key inputs like semiconductors so I think it will be relatively readily apparent if there is non-compliance and the task will be to trace that back to its origin.”

Russia won’t supply gas to Europe for free: Kremlin

Peskov says Russia is yet to take a final decision on how to respond should European countries refuse to pay for Russian gas exports in roubles, but warned that Moscow would not supply fuel to the continent for free.

The Kremlin spokesman’s warning came after G7 nations rejected Russia’s demand that “unfriendly” countries pay for Russian oil and gas in roubles, not euros.

“We are not going to supply gas for free, this is clear,” Peskov said. “It is hardly possible and reasonable to engage in charity in our situation.”

Japan will ask firms not to pay in roubles for Russia transactions

Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno says Japanese companies will be asked to refuse if Russia asks for rouble payments for economic transactions, especially in the energy sector.

Russia demanded last week that “unfriendly” countries must pay in roubles, not euros, for its gas in the wake of the US and European allies teaming up on a series of sanctions aimed at Moscow.

Amnesty accuses Russia of war crimes in Mariupol

Amnesty International is accusing Russia of committing war crimes in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol.

“The siege of Mariupol, the denial of humanitarian evacuation and humanitarian escape for the population, and the targeting of civilians, according to Amnesty International’s investigation, amounts to war crimes,” said the group’s Secretary-General Agnes Callamard.

“The crisis in Ukraine right now, the invasion … is not just any kind of violation of international law,” she said. “It is an aggression. It is a violation of the UN charter of the kind that we saw when the US invaded Iraq.”

Prospects for a ceasefire in Ukraine remain slim: Analyst

William Courtney, a former US ambassador to Georgia, says he sees no sign of Russian willingness to negotiate a ceasefire in Ukraine.

“Russia is worried that there’s not a perception of sufficient Russian bargaining strength. The international media are portraying Ukraine as holding off Russian forces. Some say Russia has begun to lose the war,” he told Al Jazeera.

“So Russia seems to now want to concentrate its forces in eastern Ukraine, where it has greater relative advantage and probably to try to get a victory somewhere to strengthen its hand in the negotiations. We’ve seen no sign on the battlefield that Russia is beginning to pull out troops, which might signify that it is willing to negotiate an agreement.

“For example, on this issue, Russia is still trying to pursue victory in all of Ukraine. It hasn’t given up on seizing Kyiv, and that had been its main aim up to now.”

Pentagon may need more funding to help Ukraine

The Pentagon says it may have to ask the US Congress for additional money to support Ukraine’s battle, including replenishing the arsenal of weapons sent to Kyiv.

Rolling out the defence department’s $773bn request for the fiscal year 2023, the Pentagon said the budget was finalised before the invasion so it has no specific money for the war. Congress approved a $13.5bn emergency funding package in early March.

The Pentagon officials who presented the request said it was too early to predict how quickly Ukrainian forces will use the weapons and ammunition already provided, and how much the US will need to replace that.

Zelenskyy urges Russian oil embargo without delay

Ukraine’s president has urged Western nations to toughen sanctions against Russia, including imposing an embargo on Russian oil.

“Now there are many hints and warnings that supposedly tougher sanctions, such as an embargo on Russian oil supplies to Europe, will be put in place if Russia uses chemical weapons,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address.

“Doesn’t everything the Russian military has done to date warrant an oil embargo? Don’t phosphorus bombs warrant it? A shelled chemical production facility or a shelled nuclear power plant doesn’t warrant it?

“If the sanctions packages are weak or do not work strongly enough, if they can be circumvented, it creates a dangerous illusion for the Russian leadership, as if they will be permitted to continue doing what they are doing now,” he said.

Russia repeats that nuclear weapons are only for existential threats

Peskov has told US broadcaster PBS in an interview that Russia would only resort to nuclear weapons in the case of a “threat to the existence” of the country.

“But any outcome of the operation (in Ukraine), of course, is not a reason for usage of a nuclear weapon,” the Kremlin spokesman said, echoing comments he made to CNN last week.

“We have a security concept that very clearly states that only when there is a threat for existence of the state, in our country, we can use and we will actually use nuclear weapons to eliminate the threat for the existence of our country.”

US budget to allocate funds to ‘forcefully respond’ to Putin

Biden says his proposed annual budget, which includes a rise in military spending, allocates funds to address the crisis in Ukraine. It allocates $813.3bn in defence spending, up from $777.7bn last year.

“This budget provides the resources we need to [ensure] our military remains the best prepared, best trained, best-equipped … in the world,” Biden said.

“This budget also provides additional funding to forcefully respond to Putin’s aggression against Ukraine and its economic, humanitarian and security consequences.”

What would a ‘rupture’ in US-Russia relations mean?

The war in Ukraine is pushing US-Russia ties to the brink, with the Kremlin warning that bilateral relations are nearing “rupture” after Biden accused Putin of being a “war criminal”.

Should relations completely break down, analysts say the ramifications could ripple well beyond any potential ceasefire or peace negotiations to other areas of US-Russian diplomacy, including most notably the Iran nuclear talks.

“Russia could try to block an understanding that brings the US and Iran back into compliance,” said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association.

4,9cb640bb-b177-436c-8676-508720f15349,"['Mark Eyles-Thomas', 'Martin Cleaver']",,"Takuma Melber (translated by Nick Somers), Pearl Harbor: Japan’s Attack and America’s Entry into World War II (Polity Press, 2020).

Although there’s no shortage of hot takes and policy prognostications, it will be a long, long time before national security scholars can hope to derive enduring lessons about the start of the Russo-Ukrainian War. The historiography of major national security events unfolds as an evolving, multi-decade affair. The distance of time, growing availability of new sources, and interpretation of those sources advances and improves our understanding of such events — and reminds us of their complexity as we seek to learn enduring lessons from them. Though published eight decades after its subject, Takuma Melber’s history of Pearl Harbor is a useful contribution to our evolving understanding of the attack as an event and as a case study.

In the immediate aftermath of the Cuban Missile Crisis, the lesson that policymakers drew from the event as a case study seemed to be “firm resolve is the best approach.” After more became known, firm resolve was joined by “and hope you get lucky.” The Missile Crisis is an illustrative example of how historiography evolves following major events in national security. In its immediate aftermath, instant histories were limited largely to newspaper and magazine accounts. These were woefully incomplete compared with our modern understanding, not least because many details were either politically sensitive, formally classified, locked away in Soviet or Cuban files, or some combination of the three. Western accounts tended to repeat the official U.S. version of events: surprise Soviet aggression, determined U.S. response, Soviet capitulation. Correspondingly, lessons drawn from the crisis have shifted on the strength of new, more complete information. This was particularly true once more became known in the West about Soviet and Cuban leadership actions — and the presence of Soviet tactical nuclear weapons in and near Cuba. Robert Kennedy’s Thirteen Days claimed to offer the first truly comprehensive insider account of the political, military, and intelligence elements of the crisis just seven years on. Yet it would essentially serve as a key pillar of what Thomas Blanton calls the Cuban Missile Crisis “myth, midwifed by the Kennedy family and its hagiographers.” Various myths put forward in Thirteen Days and by other Kennedy administration insiders would sidestep, among other things, the direct quid pro quo agreement to remove U.S. missiles from Turkey and administration complicity in intelligence collection limits that forestalled American discovery of the missiles. Indeed, it would take (among others) Michael Dobbs’s One Minute to Midnight (2008) and David Barrett and Max Holland’s Blind Over Cuba (2012) to provide a thorough accounting for many of the omissions and errors of Thirteen Days.

The historiography of major national security events continues to evolve even after most primary source material has been uncovered. Any event will see newly uncovered primary sources, memoirs, and interviews in the years and decades that follow — but these eventually dwindle as the archives are thoroughly researched and protagonists pass away. There are likely not any narrative-shattering primary-source discoveries to be made regarding the Battle of Waterloo. Yet Waterloo’s story can be told better, more expansively, and more inclusively. Historiography evolves as previously unheard voices and perspectives are raised. Erik Larson’s 2015 Dead Wake, for example, did this for the story of the Lusitania. Few of the key facts or sources at the center of Larson’s work were fundamentally “new” — the majority were known to Lusitania historians and had surfaced in one venue or another in the century since the liner’s sinking. Yet Larson told the story in a new way — in his case, by constantly shifting perspectives among various participants (German submariners, Lusitania passengers, British signals analysts) as his chronology moved forward.

Always Something New

General histories of Pearl Harbor as an event have evolved significantly, from initial dramatic retelling of the event to focused study of the attack as a warning intelligence case study, to detailed, seemingly exhaustive histories drawn from the greatest breadth of archival materials, to highly readable, journalistic repackaging of the existing narratives 75 years on. The particular role of signals intelligence in this story has perhaps changed the most, as new sources have come to public light in just the past few decades, leading to serious reevaluation of initial assessments.

Melber, a lecturer at the University of Heidelberg, employs both his military history expertise and his Japanese language skills in this work. To be sure, if measured by quantity, the majority of Melber’s sources and data points are not presented here for the first time. Most of his historical narrative, verbatim quotes, and other facts and figures have appeared in one Pearl Harbor work or another over the past 80 years. Yet his work’s contribution to Pearl Harbor historiography is its folding of Japanese-language primary and secondary sources into an accessible, yet comprehensive, English-language narrative that weighs in at under 200 pages. (Melber published an earlier, German-language version in 2016.) In particular, Melber’s first 70 pages provide a fascinating look at the inner workings of Japanese political, military, and diplomatic circles. Drawing upon the Japanese-language memoirs of Japan’s ambassador to the United States, Nomura Kichisaburō, previously unpublished letters and diaries, and Japanese-language histories of the period, Melber paints a mosaic of hawks and doves, idealists and realists in Japanese circles, whose ultimate decisions were the result both of individual relationships and outside drivers.

Melber clearly outlines the outcomes of the actions on Dec. 7, 1941 as the result of large, geostrategic drivers: the complex (if not convoluted) inner workings of American and Japanese military, diplomatic, and political systems, as well as individual decisions made by individual actors that would have far-reaching consequences, especially in planning and executing the attack. Too much focus on any of these categories could lead a reader to under-appreciate the impact of the others. Pearl Harbor, like Larson’s Dead Wake, encourages readers to understand that no one category of action proceeded in a vacuum. The ultimate Japanese decision to attack, for example, was the simultaneous product of geostrategic realities (especially resource limits), previous political decision-making (the ongoing war in China), political upheaval in the Japanese government, military timetables (to successfully execute the necessary timeline of the plan for Pearl Harbor), and individual action (the bold planning of Isoroku Yamamoto and Minoru Genda).

Similarly, the failure of American intelligence to warn of the attack was the product of an institutional lack of focus on the Japanese threat compared to the war in Europe, a flawed American intelligence structure, and failings by individual analysts and commanders who should have been better postured against the threat of a Japanese air attack on Pearl Harbor. This kaleidoscope of drivers is not brand-new information — nor is it something that previous Pearl Harbor historians like Gordon Prange would challenge — but it is presented in a compelling, succinct, and well-sourced manner. Melber’s work reminds us that, as is so often the case, when we ask questions like “which was the most important reason for a major military attack?” or “which was the most important cause of a major intelligence failure?” the answer is correctly “yes.”

Melber’s work is not flawless. In recounting heightened tensions between the United States and Japan in the summer of 1941, he hints at a false equivalency between American and Japanese considerations of pre-emptive attacks, citing President Franklin Roosevelt’s authorization of sales of U.S. bomber and attack aircraft to China for use by Claire Chennault’s “Flying Tigers” American Volunteer Group to attack Japanese industrial targets. Melber frames this as “authorizing a military operation initiated by Chennault.” In point of fact, Roosevelt did no such thing — providing aircraft to the friendly Chinese government for use by the American Volunteer Group (regardless of what Roosevelt believed they might be used for) was not, as Melber puts it, “a pre-emptive American strike.” (Indeed, while not reflective of the larger character of Melber’s work, mischaracterizations like this illustrate the historiography challenge even decades on. General readers unfamiliar with the source material may be led to believe this is a widely accepted interpretation of the Roosevelt administration’s approach to possible preemptive attack — it is not, but may slightly bend the arc of Pearl Harbor’s evolving historiography in the wrong direction.) Later, in listing attack indications missed by U.S. intelligence, Melber notes a report from U.S. Ambassador Joseph Grew that a representative from the Peruvian embassy in Tokyo passed word that Japan’s opening attack in a future war with the U.S. would be a large-scale attack on Pearl Harbor. This report, widely addressed in existing Pearl Harbor literature, was rightfully ignored by U.S. intelligence: subsequent Office of Naval Intelligence research traced the source of the report to a rumor heard by a Japanese cook at the Peruvian embassy in December 1940, a month before Yamamoto had even proposed his attack plan to Japanese military leadership. The rumor, in turn, almost certainly originated from popular Japanese military fiction novels speculating about a future Pacific war rather than any insider knowledge of the attack. This cable from Grew has long fascinated Pearl Harbor historians, given what transpired nearly a year later — but, counter to Melber’s assertion that the War Department should be “reproached” for ignoring this report, U.S. intelligence was correct to discount it as having no clear basis in actual Japanese planning at the time.

One dynamic that Melber’s work helpfully illustrates is the elaborate, interwoven, interdependent nature of drivers when it comes to national policy as it moves forward in real time (rather than as we perceive it looking back). So many treatments of Pearl Harbor treat the Dec. 7 attack as an inevitable, singular conclusion toward which U.S. and Japanese foreign and military policy were marching together for months (if not years). Studies focused on the military and intelligence dynamics of the attack especially tend to start a clock running either in September 1940 (with the United States issuing major economic sanctions following Japan’s invasion of Indochina) or January 1941 (when Yamamoto secured approval to begin planning a carrier aviation strike on Pearl Harbor). Melber’s use of new Japanese primary sources and his book’s narrative focus on developments in the Japanese government in the summer and early autumn of 1941 make clear the terribly complex, often personal drivers behind Japan’s ultimate decision to move forward with the attack. Again, these dynamics have been addressed elsewhere — in general histories of World War II and the onset of the war between the United States and Japan — but Melber’s coupling of this deeper background to the specific attack on Pearl Harbor is what gives the book unique value.

A sub-element of these complex dynamics is the individual role played by each political, military, and diplomatic leader on both sides of the situation. While many individual details have appeared in other forums, Melber’s focused use of memoirs, individual correspondence, official government records, and sources previously unseen in English-language histories richly evokes the chaotic, incomplete, and confusing picture seen by individual diplomats and politicians. Just as Aleksandr Fursenko and Timothy Naftali’s One Hell Of A Gamble tells a breakneck-pace tale of suspicion, intrigue, and misestimation during the Cuban Missile Crisis, Melber’s work provides a similar service for the months and weeks preceding Pearl Harbor. As the book culminates in parallel narratives of final Japanese attack preparations — and ultimate American failure to detect and adequately posture against them — Melber’s narrative approach reinforces and succinctly recounts the intelligence lessons for both the United States and Japan put forward by Prange, Steve Twomey, and others. Both the flawed American intelligence system and individual poor decisions abetted warning failure at Pearl Harbor. But similar systemic and individual failings led Japan to fundamentally misestimate the prospects for long-term military victory following any surprise attack on the United States in the Pacific.

Conclusion

My father — a history professor and U.S. Air Force Reserve officer — was asked in 1978 to assemble a case study on the topic of warning intelligence for what is now the National Intelligence University. Some colleagues felt he should use a contemporary example to connect with students, who were mid-career warning intelligence specialists. He decided instead to reach back nearly four decades to Japan’s surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. The Tet Offensive (1968), Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia (1968), and 1973 October Surprise all seemed more fresh and relevant. As he and I have described elsewhere, however, Pearl Harbor avoided some of the deep emotions, bureaucratic biases, and source material limits that plagued the historiography of those other, more recent events. Pearl Harbor offered a better case for which more details were known — indeed, could be known — because of this distance of time, the resulting availability of primary sources, and the analysis and reanalysis of journalists, academics, and other observers that shaped, updated, and improved Pearl Harbor’s historiography. Looking back over the eight decades of Pearl Harbor historiography, while my father was correct about the relative historiographic viability of Pearl Harbor in 1978, he could not hope to have known just how much more we would learn — and how much perspectives would change — over the next four decades.

Historical examples and case studies form the bedrock of so much national security thinking. It is seen most often in the trope of comparative metaphors, usually grounded in one German city or another (e.g., is each new international crisis 1938 Munich or 1961 Berlin?) The historiography of events like Pearl Harbor offers a cautionary reminder of Francis Gavin’s recommendation to think historically: “many facts have to be collected, shaved down to look alike, then aggregated and analyzed to discover generalizable laws of the universe.” Our understanding of Pearl Harbor — and the lessons that we might reasonably draw from it — continues to evolve eight decades later. Given how much national security professionals and educators rely on such case studies as data and reference points for their work today, we all have a responsibility to stay current with the latest histories — and remind ourselves of their complexity as we seek to learn enduring lessons from them.
