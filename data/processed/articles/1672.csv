PARIS, Feb 26 (Reuters) - A decision to cut Russia off from the global SWIFT payment system will be taken in a matter of days, the governor of a central bank within the euro zone told Reuters on Saturday.

""SWIFT is just a matter of time, very short time, days,"" the central bank governor, who asked not to be named, said.

""Is it sufficient? No. Is it necessary? Absolutely. Sanctions only make sense if there are costs for both sides and this will be costly,"" the central banker added.

Sanger', 'Alan Rappeport', 'Matina Stevis-Gridneff']",2022-02-26,"Biden administration officials said on Saturday that there would be new restrictions by the United States and its allies against selling rubles to Russia, undercutting the country’s ability to support its currency in the face of new sanctions on its financial sector. That, in turn, could cause inflation — and while administration officials did not say so explicitly, they are clearly hoping that could fuel protests against Mr. Putin’s rule in Russia.

“We know that Russia has been taking steps since 2014 to sanctions-proof its economy, in part through the stockpiling of foreign exchange reserves,” said Emily Kilcrease, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. “The central bank sanctions will limit their ability to leverage this asset, along with constraining their ability to conduct monetary policy of any sort to manage the economic damage from other sanctions.”

The United States and its allies also announced steps to put pressure on Russia’s elites, including creating a task force that the White House said would “identify, hunt down and freeze the assets of sanctioned Russian companies and oligarchs — their yachts, their mansions and any other ill-gotten gains that we can find and freeze under the law.”

The idea is to strike those who are closest to Mr. Putin and undermine their ability to live in both Russia and the West. In another new move, the United States and its allies said they would seek to limit the sale of so-called golden passports that allow wealthy Russians who are connected to the Russian government to become citizens of Western nations and gain access to their financial systems.

While the steps are some of the harshest taken yet, the announcement falls short of a blanket cutoff of Russia from SWIFT, which some officials see as a nuclear option of sorts. Such a move would have essentially severed Russia from much of the global financial system.

And some experts say that it may only drive Russia to expand the alternative to the SWIFT system that it created several years ago when it began trying to “sanction-proof” its economy. But Russia’s equivalent system is primarily domestic; making it a competitor to SWIFT, officials say, would require teaming up with China.

The moves on Saturday came on the same day that Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, announced that his government was approving a transfer of antitank weapons to the Ukrainian military, ending his insistence on providing only nonlethal aid, such as helmets.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/26/us/politics/eu-us-swift-russia.html
9,7c86d2b1-5ed4-45d1-87a3-e31aaebdbce6,['Jane Clinton'],2022-02-26,"The US, Britain, the EU and Canada have moved to block Russia’s access to the Swift international banking payment system.

In a statement issued by the White House, the countries said they condemned “[Vladimir] Putin’s war of choice and attacks on the sovereign nation and people of Ukraine”.

It added: “We will hold Russia to account and collectively ensure that this war is a strategic failure for Putin.”

There had been mounting pressure for greater sanctions as Vladimir Putin continues his assault on Ukraine.

The UK and Spain were early supporters of the move to lock Russia out of Swift, the main secure messaging system that banks use to make rapid and secure cross-border payments, but the US was initially lukewarm and Germany was also reluctant.

On Saturday, however, Annalena Baerbock, Germany’s foreign minister, said the country was working on a “targeted and functional restriction” on Swift. Hours later, the joint statement by western allies, including Germany, was released, with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, also announcing the measure.

Von der Leyen said: “The European Union and its partners are working to cripple Putin’s ability to finance his war machine.”

Announcing the further sanctions she said that they would “commit to ensuring that a certain number of Russian banks are removed from Swift”. It is understood the final list of institutions is still being drawn up.

Von der Leyen added: “This will ensure that these banks are disconnected from the international financial system and harm their ability to operate globally … Cutting banks off will stop them from conducting most of their financial transactions worldwide and effectively block Russian exports and imports.”

The Swift international payments system said it was preparing to implement the new measures in coming days. “We are engaging with European authorities to understand the details of the entities that will be subject to the new measures and we are preparing to comply upon legal instruction,” it said in a statement.

Von der Leyen said there would also be measures put in place to “stop Putin using his war chest”.

“We will paralyse the assets of Russia’s central bank. This will freeze its transactions and it will make it impossible for the central bank to liquidate assets.”

She added: “And finally, we will work to prohibit Russian oligarchs from using their financial assets on our markets.”

The statement from the White House said this would mean limiting “the sale of citizenship – so-called golden passports – that let wealthy Russians connected to the Russian government become citizens of our countries and gain access to our financial systems”.

Von der Leyen said this latest raft of measures will “significantly harm Putin’s ability to finance his war”.

The statement from the White House also said that a “transatlantic taskforce” will be launched in the coming week that will “ensure the effective implementation of our financial sanctions by identifying and freezing the assets of sanctioned individuals and companies that exist within our jurisdictions”.

It continued: “We are committed to employing sanctions and other financial and enforcement measures on additional Russian officials and elites close to the Russian government, as well as their families, and their enablers to identify and freeze the assets they hold in our jurisdictions.

“We stand with the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian people in their heroic efforts to resist Russia’s invasion,” it said.

The prime minister of Ukraine, Denys Shmyhal, posted on Twitter: “Thanks to our friends … for the commitment to remove several Russian banks from SWIFT” and for “the paralysis of the assets of the central bank of Russia”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/26/us-uk-europe-and-canada-to-block-russian-access-to-swift
