A mass grave in the Ukrainian town of Bucha has been spotted from space.

Maxar Technologies' WorldView-3 satellite snapped photos of the mass grave, on the grounds of the Church of St. Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints, on March 31. The grave site includes a trench about 45 feet (14 meters) long, company representatives said in an emailed statement.

Local residents and the Kyiv Regional Police — Bucha is not far from the Ukrainian capital — said they believe at least 150 people are interred in the makeshift grave, CNN reported . And Bucha's mayor said the number could be twice that high, according to CNN, which stressed that it could not independently verify either figure.

Bucha residents said that excavation of the mass grave began not long after Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, CNN reported. A second newly released WorldView-3 photo shows some initial digging work being done in the churchyard on March 10.

The scale and scope of the devastation in Bucha, Kyiv and other towns and cities in northern Ukraine are just now coming to light as Russian forces retreat from the region. Bucha was hit particularly hard; Ukrainians coming back into the town ""are finding scores of bodies in yards and on the roads amid mounting evidence of intentional and indiscriminate killings of civilians"" by Russian soldiers, The New York Times wrote .

Such scenes have outraged many people around the world and spurred talk of tougher punishments against Russia for the invasion of Ukraine , which is ongoing.

Satellite images have revealed what appears to be a mass grave and the bodies of civilians scattered in the streets of the Ukrainian town of Bucha. The images implicate Russian troops in a massacre.

Many of the images were taken during the Russian occupation of Bucha by Maxar Technologies' WorldView-3 satellite. They show that the bodies — some of which were discovered by eyewitnesses with their hands bound and with gunshot wounds to the head — could have been in the streets for as long as three weeks.

Another, taken on March 31, shows what is likely a mass grave on the grounds of a church, which includes a trench that is roughly 45 feet (14 meters) long, according to Maxar , a satellite company that produces ""90% of the foundational geospatial intelligence used by the U.S. Government for national security and keeping troops safe on the ground,"" as well as the imagery for companies such as Google Earth and Google Maps. A previous Maxar satellite image, taken on March 10, shows what looks like the initial excavations of the grave.

The connection between Russian troops and the alleged massacre was documented over time thanks to the increasingly powerful satellite imagery available today. Maxar’s WorldView-3 satellite has a color image resolution of 12 inches (31 centimeters) according to Maxar’s website. That means that it can distinguish between patches of dark and light, and different colors, enough to pick out individual people, cars and other small objects. In contrast, earlier satellites, such as NASA's Landsat Imagers, have resolution down to 50 feet (15 meters) — enough to pick out environmental features such as lakes, forests and mountains, but not enough to identify people or small objects in an urban landscape, according to Maxar.

Maxar currently has four satellites in orbit, all of which are in sun synchronous orbits — a particular kind of polar orbit which enables an imaging satellite to orbit from pole to pole in a fixed position relative to the sun as Earth rotates beneath it. This lets the satellite constantly capture longitudinal slices of the parts of the planet where it is daytime.

Maxar’s WorldView-3 operates at an altitude of 383 miles (618 kilometers), and can also return to image the same patch of ground in less than a day. Its ability to revisit the same location effectively, however, is dependent on weather conditions, a Maxar spokesperson told Live Science in an email.

This ability to recapture images of the same places very frequently is what helped the satellites tie the massacre with the town’s occupation by Russian troops. Of nine images taken on March 18th, 19th and 31st and provided by Maxar to Reuters , four of them appear to show bodies lying on Yablonska Street, a road in the town. Maxar also provided a separate set of images to The New York Times, which, after analyzing the pictures, wrote that it could confirm that the locations of the bodies on the ground were as they had been imaged by the satellite.

""We found mass graves filled with civilians. We found people with their hands and with their legs tied up and with bullet holes at the back of their heads,"" Sergey Nikiforov, the spokesman for Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, told the BBC’s Sunday Morning show on April 3. ""They were clearly civilians and they were executed. We found half-burned bodies as if somebody tried to hide the crimes, but actually they didn’t have enough time to do it properly.""

Ukrainian forces say they discovered the bodies upon entering Bucha, which is just 18.6 miles (30 kilometers) northwest of Kyiv, on Friday (April 1) after last week’s withdrawal of Russian units from the area.

In a Telegram post made on Sunday (April 3), the Russian Ministry of Defense denied responsibility for the killings, suggesting that the bodies had been placed on the streets after Russian units withdrew from the town around March 30. But the images taken by Maxar contradict this claim, showing that the civilian bodies lying on the streets, and the first mass grave being dug in the grounds of a town church, seemed to appear weeks before Russian troops withdrew from the town.

Both the UN and Human Rights Watch have called for independent investigations into what happened in Bucha, and Michelle Bachelet, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a statement that she was horrified by the images.

""Reports emerging from this and other areas raise serious and disturbing questions about possible war crimes as well as grave breaches of international humanitarian law and serious violations of international human rights law,” Bachelet said. ""It is essential that all bodies are exhumed and identified so that victims’ families can be informed, and the exact causes of death established. All measures should be taken to preserve evidence.""

Human Rights Watch says that it has documented several cases of members of the Russian military committing ""laws-of-war violations"" in Ukraine, including rape and summary killings.

The latest satellite images by Maxar Technologies showed an approximately 45-foot-long trench dug into the grounds of a church in the Ukrainian town of Bucha where a mass grave was identified.



The images, captured on March 31, followed previous imagery from March 10 that show signs of excavation on the grounds of the Church of St. Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints, Maxar Technologies said.

According to Bucha's deputy mayor, Taras Shapravskyi, nearly 300 bodies of those killed during a month-long occupation by the Russian army had been buried in mass graves in the ruined Kyiv suburb

Despite Russian denial of targeting civilians, condemnation was swift, with Western leaders, NATO and the United Nations voicing horror at reports of civilian murders in Bucha and elsewhere.

Ukraine's foreign minister called on the International Criminal Court to collect evidence of what he called Russian war crimes. The foreign ministers of France and Britain said their countries would support any such probe.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was unsparing in his nightly video message, warning ""concentrated evil has come to our land"".

He described Russian troops as ""murderers, torturers, rapists, looters, who call themselves the army and who deserve only death after what they did.""

President Zelensky warned that the worst could be yet to come as Moscow refocuses its attention on the south and east of the country.

Russia, however, denied targeting civilians and said that all photographs and videos published by the Ukrainian authorities alleging ""crimes"" by Russian troops in Bucha were a ""provocation,"" and no resident of Bucha suffered violence at the hands of Russian troops.",https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ukraine-mass-grave-satellite-images-show-45-foot-long-trench-at-grave-site-in-ukraines-bucha-2861138

Olga Sukhenk, the mayor of Motyzhyn — a suburban village just outside the capital, Kyiv — and her family were believed to have been kidnapped by invading Russian troops on March 23, Ukrainian officials said.

The troops then “tortured and murdered the whole family of the village head,” said Anton Herashchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian interior ministry.

“The occupiers suspected they were collaborating with our military, giving us locations of where to target our artillery.

“These scum tortured, slaughtered and killed the whole family,” he said, naming Sukhenko, her husband, Ihor Sukhenko, and their son, Oleksandr.

A Reuters reporter saw the bodies in a shallow grave in a forest near a farm, which had been all but destroyed, just outside Motyzhyn.

A fourth body — an unidentified man who appeared to have been tied up — was seen in a well near the burned-out farm, where black burn marks climbed up its few remaining walls, the Reuters reporter said.

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk confirmed the mayor’s murder, saying she had been among 11 mayors and community heads taken into Russian captivity across Ukraine.

They were among the bodies of at least 410 civilians who have been removed from Kyiv-area towns in what President Volodymyr Zelensky called a “genocide.’’

On Monday, satellite images emerged of a 45-foot-long trench dug into the grounds of a Ukrainian church where a mass grave was found about 20 miles from Motyzhyn in the Kyiv suburb Bucha, where shocking scenes emerged of bodies left in the street.

The images were shared by Maxar Technologies, which collects and publishes satellite imagery of Ukraine.

The US company said the first signs of excavation for a mass grave at the Church of St. Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints were seen on March 10, soon growing to at least 45 feet.

Reuters journalists who visited Bucha also saw a mass grave at a local church, with hands and feet poking through the red clay heaped on top.

President Zelensky toured the area Monday, saying that “dead people have been found in barrels, basements, strangled, tortured.”

“What you see around, what they did to this modern town, is a characteristic of the Russian military, who treated people worse than animals. These are war crimes, and this will be recognized by the world as genocide,” Zelensky said, Ukrainian outlet UNIAN reported.

Zelensky said the disturbing discovery may impact peace talks to end the invasion.

“It’s very difficult to conduct negotiations when you see what they did here,” Zelensky said.

Zelensky insisted that “the longer the Russian Federation drags it out, the worse it will exacerbate its own situation and this war.”

“It’s very difficult to conduct negotiations when you see what they did here,” Zelensky said, adding that Russia’s leadership “needs to think faster if it has what to think with.”

Zelensky insisted that “the longer the Russian Federation drags it out, the worse it will exacerbate its own situation and this war.”

The sickening scenes led to other world leaders on Monday declaring it clear genocide.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez called for those responsible for the slayings in Bucha to be punished, saying they should “answer these alleged cases of crimes against humanity, war crimes and, why not say it, of genocide, too.”

Poland’s Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki described Russia as a “totalitarian-fascist state,” saying “the bloody massacres perpetrated by Russian soldiers deserve to be called by name: This is genocide.”

Estonia Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said the photos of bodies scattered in the city “recall the mass killings by Soviet and Nazi regimes.”

“This is not a battlefield, it’s a crime scene. Mass killings of Ukrainian civilians by #Russia are clear war crime,” Kallas said on Twitter and called for “a 5th round of strong EU sanctions as soon as possible.”

French President Emmanuel Macron also said Monday that there is “clear evidence of war crimes” in Bucha.

“What just happened in Bucha calls for a new round of sanctions and very clear measures,” he said on France-Inter radio. “We need to act.”

The United Nations’ top human rights official is calling for “independent and effective investigations” into what happened in the Ukrainian town of Bucha.

U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said in a statement Monday that she is “horrified by the images of civilians lying dead on the streets and in improvised graves.”

She added that “reports emerging from this and other areas raise serious and disturbing questions about possible war crimes, grave breaches of international humanitarian law and serious violations of international human rights law.”

Bucha's mayor indicated the number might be twice as high. But reports cautioned that neither figure could be independently verified.

The same CNN report also pointed out that residents in Bucha claim that excavation of the mass grave began soon after Russia entered Ukraine on Feb. 24. On Mar. 10, a second recently published WorldView-3 photo reveals some preliminary excavating activity in the churchyard.

As Russian soldiers withdraw from the region, the size and breadth of the damage in Bucha, Kyiv, and other towns and cities in northern Ukraine are just now becoming clear. The New York Times reported that Ukrainians returning to Bucha are ""discovering scores of dead in yards and on the roadways amid rising evidence of purposeful and indiscriminate executions of civilians"" by Russian forces.

Number of People Officially Buried in Mass Graves

According to AFP News Agency, Mayor Anatoly Fedoruk said officials in Bucha had already buried almost 300 individuals in mass graves despite indications that Russian soldiers are retreating from the town. The streets, reports added, are ""littered with bodies.""

When the invasion began on Feb. 24, Bucha, a city of around 28,000 people, became a battleground. The Kyiv Independent said the suburb of Kyiv was under Russian military control for weeks. After the town was retaken from departing Russian soldiers, the bodies of hundreds of slain Ukrainian residents were discovered.

HRW legal advisor 'pretty optimistic' war crimes cases will materialize

Human Rights Watch (HRW) senior legal advisor Aisling Reidy told DW that the organization, like several other international organs, was just beginning its investigation into what happened at Bucha and other Ukrainian communities during Russian occupation.

But Reidy said that while HRW did not have enough information to see the full scope of the events, they did have witnesses.

""We do know that there have been war crimes, that we've spoken to people who witnessed war crimes having been committed there,"" Reidy said.

""We were able to document one witness account of a woman who had you know, actually, eye witnessed a summary execution where men had been lined up in a row for them kneeling down, and one of them had their t-shirt pulled over their head and then was shot in the back of the head,"" she said.

Reidy said she believed it was ""quite likely"" that those responsible for the crimes could be found, given that a lot of information about the Russian military and its operations exists.

""I think there's going to be evidence there of who was operating where when different war crimes were committed. There's going to be, in some extent, you know, eyewitness testimony that may help narrow down who's responsible.""

Reidy said that the International Criminal Court would likely seek individuals who bear the most responsibility.

""[This] may not mean the person who pulled the trigger on the ground, but who is in charge of that particular operation, who was the commander and should have known what was going on, could have prevented it, fail to punish it, and that's known as command responsibility,"" she said.

Extraditing Russian soldiers or officials to international courts could prove rather more challenging, however.

Germany puts Gazprom Germania under state trusteeship

Economy Minister Robert Habeck said on Monday that he had appointed the German government's regulator for electricity, gas and other core industries in temporary control of the German subsidiary of Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom.

Gazprom had announced on Friday that it was separating from its Gazprom Germania subsidiary, having previously been the sole owner. It did not make clear whether the organization had been sold, or who it planned to leave in control.

Habeck said that the company controlled critical infrastructure in Germany and that the lack of clarity over its ownership led to the temporary step. The Bundesnetzagentur regulator is scheduled to control the company until the end of September.

""Ordering the trusteeship serves both the maintenance of public security and order and the maintenance of supply security,"" Habeck said. ""Gazprom Germania GmbH [plc] with its headquarters in Berlin is a domestic company.""

The company is primarily involved in gas trade, transportation and storage, and owns other companies in the German gas industry.

Merkel defends 2008 NATO decision on Ukraine membership

Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel has defended the decision not to admit Ukraine into NATO in 2008.

This follows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy calling out Merkel and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy by name late on Sunday when talking about the alleged killing of civilians in Bucha. Zelenskyy said France and Germany's reported resistance to a bid to fast track Ukraine's NATO membership had proven to be a failed policy.

""Former German Chancellor Dr Angela Merkel stands by her decisions in connection with the 2008 NATO summit in Bucharest,"" a spokesperson for Merkel told German news agency dpa.

The statement also said that, in light of the images from Bucha, international and German efforts to stop the conflict had Merkel's ""full support.""

Ukraine had requested NATO membership in 2008 at a summit in Romania, but the request was rejected by EU member states.

Germany's comparative closeness to Russia has come under scrutiny more generally in recent weeks, hitting both the country's major parties.

Social Democrat former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder has faced particular criticism for his post-politics ties to Russian oil and gas, but Ukraine's ambassador in Berlin on Sunday also singled out current President Frank-Walter Steinmeier as partly to blame, given his past as foreign minister.

Oligarch's superyacht seized by Spanish police

Spanish authorities on Monday impounded a superyacht belonging to Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg. The vessel which is valued at $99 million (€90 million euros) was seized in a shipyard in Mallorca at the request of US authorities.

Documents and storage devices were among the items seized.

Vekselberg's ship is the first Russian yacht seized by the US under sanctions imposed after the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine.

""It will not be the last.'' Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. ""Together, with our international partners, we will do everything possible to hold accountable any individual whose criminal acts enable the Russian government to continue its unjust war,'' he added.

Vekselberg, who was born in Ukraine, is not on the list of individuals sanctioned by the EU in response to the invasion of Ukraine. However, he was placed on a US sanctions list relating to allegations of interference in the 2016 US presidential elections, and is on a list of people close to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Vekselberg has a long history of ties to the US. In the past, he was a green card holder and had homes in New York and Connecticut.

Vekselberg has been a major player in aluminium. He ranks among the wealthiest people in Russia and owns the world's largest collection of Faberge eggs.

Viktor Vekselberg is among the wealthiest individuals and is considered to be in Russian President Vladimir Putin's inner circle

Radiological risks in Chernobyl exclusion zone overstated

In the past weeks, Ukrainian authorities have sounded the alarm about the radiological risks in the Chernobyl exclusion zone from wildfires and dust caused by Russian hostilities, heavy vehicles and trench-digging.

However, scientists have told DW that the facts have been misconstrued and the radiological risks from the exclusion zone have been overstated. Before Ukrainian forces retook Chernobyl, the country’s parliamentary Human Rights Commissioner Liudmyla Denisova claimed that 10,000 hectares of the Chernobyl exclusion zone were uncontrollably ablaze, causing risks of cross-border radioactive air pollution. The claims and warnings were repeated by Ukrainian parliamentarians and news outlets.

However, the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS), which detects and monitors wildfires from space, told DW that just 1,000 hectares had caught fire within 50 kilometers (31 miles) of Chernobyl and are no longer ablaze. These months usually have elevated fire risks anyway, due to agricultural practices.

Even if the whole area did catch fire, the radiological risks are low. Valery Kashparov, Director of Ukrainian Institute of Agricultural Radiology (UIAR), told DW that the supposed risks are “the opinion of incompetent people.” Kashparov said fires in the exclusion zone do not pose a radiological hazard to the population outside the Chernobyl zone or to firefighters.

He said claims of Russian soldiers receiving radiation poisoning were impossible, unless they were actually inside the destroyed fourth unit of the power plant or the radioactive waste storage facilities, of which there is no evidence.

Nikolaos Evangeliou, a scientist at the Norwegian Institute for Air Research who has studied Chernobyl and Fukushima extensively, told DW that modelling of fires in the exclusion zone found even catastrophic burning presented insignificant dangers for the European population.

Evangeliou said although the dust in the exclusion zone is radioactive, the muddy conditions in Ukraine at the moment mean it is unlikely that any dust will be thrown into the atmosphere. It may be a different story if the war continues into summer.

The most worrying scenario for Evangeliou, from a radiological standpoint, is the risk of a missile hitting a nuclear site. To this end, he has released daily models of possible cross-border outcomes from a major nuclear incident in Ukraine.

US seeks Russia's suspension from Human Rights Council

In response to Ukrainian accusations of war crimes carried out by Russian forces, the US has said that it will ask the UN General Assembly to suspend Russia from its position on the Human Rights Council.

""Russia's participation on the Human Rights Council is a farce,"" US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said during a visit to Romania. ""And it is wrong, which is why we believe it is time the UN General Assembly vote to remove them,"" she added.

Russia is in its second term out of three sitting in the Geneva-based council. A two-thirds majority vote can oust any member for systemic violations of human rights.

The UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet expressed her horror on Monday after seeing the images coming out of Bucha.

""I am horrified by the images of civilians lying dead on the streets and in improvised graves in the town of Bucha in Ukraine,"" she said in a statement.

""Reports emerging from this and other areas raise serious and disturbing questions about possible war crimes, grave breaches of international humanitarian law and serious violations of international human rights law,"" she added.

Germany condemns scenes from Bucha

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock joined the many voices condemning the mass killing of civilians in the town of Bucha outside Kyiv.

""The pictures out of Kyiv are unbearable,"" Baerbock wrote on Twitter. ""Putin's unrestrained violence is wiping out innocent families and knows no limits.""

She also called for those responsible to be brought to justice and for further sanctions against Moscow.

""Those who are responsible for these war crimes must be held to account. We will increase our sanctions against Russia and strengthen our support for Ukraine,"" she added.

Sumy towns free of Russian troops, governor says

The governor of the northern Ukrainian region of Sumy, Dmytro Zhivitsky, said on Monday that there were no longer any Russian troops in towns or villages in the region.

Sumy lies on the border with Belarus and parts of it had been occupied for almost a month. Zhivitsky said in a video message that the Russian forces had left behind lots of military equipment.

The news agency RBK Ukraina also said that the road between Kyiv and Chernihiv was once again open on Monday. The mayor of the city, which is 130 kilometers (80 miles) north of Kyiv, said that Russian shelling had destroyed 70% of the city.

Kremlin denies accusations of civilian killings

Moscow has again denied the accusations from Ukraine that Russian forces carried out mass killings in towns around the capital, Kyiv, while they were under Russian control.

""We categorically deny any accusations,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday.

He claimed that the footage of dead bodies in Bucha were ""fakes"" and said that Russia would push ahead with its call for a UN Security Council meeting over what it called ""Ukrainian provocations.""

Peskov also urged the international community not to draw any conclusions.

""The situation is undoubtedly serious and we would ask that many international leaders not rush with their statements, not rush with their baseless accusations, request information from different sources, and at least listen to our explanations.""

He did not say whether outrage over Bucha would hamper the talks planned for Monday between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators.

Spanish and Polish PMs denounce 'genocide'

The prime ministers of Spain and Poland have called the killings of civilians in the towns around Kyiv ""genocide.""

Polish leader Mateusz Morawiecki called for an international investigation into the claims made by Ukraine that Russian soldiers executed, raped and tortured civilians in the towns of Bucha and Irpin.

""These bloody massacres committed by Russians, by Russian soldiers, deserve to be called what they are. This is genocide and it must be judged,"" Morawiecki told reporters.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez also called for an investigation into Russian war crimes.

""We will do everything to ensure that those who have perpetrated these war crimes do not go unpunished, and therefore appear before the courts... to deal with these alleged cases of (crimes against) humanity, war crimes and why not say it too, genocide,"" he said.

EU considers urgent sanctions in wake of 'atrocities'

The European Union condemned the ""atrocities"" that have been reported in several towns that had been occupied by Russian forces and said it is planning on introducing new sanctions against Moscow.

The EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Monday that ""the Russian authorities are responsible for these atrocities, committed while they had effective control of the area. They are subject to the international law of occupation.""

He added that the ""haunting images of large numbers of civilian deaths and casualties, as well as destruction of civilian infrastructures show the true face of the brutal war of aggression Russia is waging against Ukraine and its people.""

As a result, the bloc ""will advance, as a matter of urgency, work on further sanctions against Russia.""

Red Cross: 'We've seen images of utter desolation and destruction'

Alyona Synenko, a Ukrainian working with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), spoke with DW about alleged atrocities committed by Russian soldiers in the Kyiv suburbs of Bucha and Irpin.

""The images that are circulating and that we saw are simply shocking. And it is at the core of the international humanitarian law that civilians and civilian infrastructure must be protected,"" she said of accusations that Moscow's troops had executed civilians and raped local women.

""If we don't work independently, we simply don't work because neutrality and independence are at the core principles of what we do that allow us to document violations of international humanitarian law and speak with warring parties to prevent those violations from happening,"" she said of the ICRC's need to work independently and in a non-partisan way.

""And this is what we are striving to do in Ukraine as well. Of course, the access has been extremely difficult to many places because of the heavy fighting, heavy shelling,"" she added.

Watch video 03:39 'People need just absolutely everything': ICRC

""We've seen images of utter desolation and destruction. Entire civilian neighborhoods are destroyed beyond repair. Streets are littered with unexploded remnants of war. There are still places that are heavily mined and are extremely dangerous to get to, which is a huge problem for us because we are trying to get more supplies into these places. And unfortunately, right now it is impossible to send trucks.""

Ukraine renews calls for German embargo of Russian fuel

The Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, called on the German government to reconsider its stance on sanctions against Russian fossil fuels following the accusations of mass killings in areas formerly occupied by Russian forces.

He addressed the German government in a tweet, saying: ""I recommend you read these reports about raped and murdered children in Bucha and Irpin before you start explaining to us again why an immediate embargo on Russian gas, oil and coal isn't feasible.""

""How will Germany live with this?"" he added.

Number of bodies in Bucha reaches 330 — report

The Ukrainian newspaper Ukrayinska Pravda reported that the number of bodies found in the city of Bucha has risen to 330-340, citing a local funeral service.

A worker told the paper that they did not have complete lists of those allegedly killed by the Russian troops, adding that a search for further victims is ongoing.

France calls for fresh sanctions after Bucha killings

French President Emmanuel Macron said on Monday that he was in favor of introducing new sanctions against Russia after Ukraine said that Russian forces had carried out mass killings of civilians in areas around Kyiv.

Macron told French Inter radio that there were ""clear indications"" of Russian war crimes in Bucha. ""What happened in Bucha demands a new round of sanctions and very clear measures,"" he added.

He also called for the individuals responsible to be held accountable. ""International justice must take care of this and those who committed these crimes will have to answer for them,"" Macron said.

He joined other European officials in tabling again the possibility of imposing sanctions against Russian fossil fuel exports. The EU is broadly dependent on Russian oil and gas while the Russian economy is dependent on its fossil fuel exports.

UK intelligence notes Russian consolidation in Donbas

Monday's intelligence update from the UK's Ministry of Defence stated that Russia is consolidating its position in the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine — parts of which have been under the control of Russian-backed separatists since 2014.

Zelenskyy accused Russians of committing atrocities against unarmed civilians in Bucha and other Ukrainian cities.

The Ukrainian leader also announced the creation of a special agency to investigate and litigate crimes committed by Russian forces.

""There is a common responsibility. For these killings, for this torture, for arms blown off by blasts... For the shots in the back of the head,"" Zelenskyy added.

Images from Bucha near Kyiv, where civilian corpses were found on the streets and mass graves were found after Russia's withdrawal, have prompted international outrage.

A mass grave has been discovered in the town of Bucha

Zelensky also took aim at former German Chancellor Angela Merkel and France's former President Nicolas Sarkozy, claiming their Russia policy contributed to the current crisis.

""I invite Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy to visit Bucha and see what a policy of concessions for 14 years has led to,"" he said.

In 2008, Germany, France and smaller NATO states withstood pressure from the US to offer Ukraine membership of the alliance, saying it wasn't ready and Russia could be antagonized.

The essence of this mechanism is the joint work of national and international experts: investigators, prosecutors and judges. This mechanism will help Ukraine and the world bring to concrete justice those who unleashed or in any way participated in this terrible war against the Ukrainian people and in crimes against our people.” Everyone guilty of such crimes will be included in a special Book of Torturers, will be found and punished.

And who deserve only death after what they did.” Ukraine’s President Zelenskiy vowed to investigate and prosecute all Russian “crimes” in Ukraine, saying he had created a “special mechanism” to do so.

Photograph: Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/Reuters Addressing the mothers of Russian soldiers, he added: I want every mother of every Russian soldier to see the bodies of the killed people in Bucha, in Irpin, in Hostomel. What did they do? Why were they killed? What did the man who was riding his bicycle down the street do? Why were ordinary civilians in an ordinary peaceful city tortured to death? Why were women strangled after their earrings were ripped out of their ears? How could women be raped and killed in front of children? How could their corpses be desecrated even after death? Why did they crush the bodies of people with tanks? What did the Ukrainian city of Bucha do to your Russia? How did all this become possible? Russian mothers! Even if you raised looters, how did they also become butchers? ... They killed deliberately and with pleasure.” Zelenskiy also placed the blame on Russian officials. I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being fulfilled. Such orders. Such a fulfilment. And joint responsibility. For these murders, for these tortures, for these arms torn off by explosions that lie on the streets. For shots in the back of the head of tied people.” “This is how the Russian state will now be perceived. This is your image,” he added. “Your culture and human appearance perished together with the Ukrainian men and women to whom you came.” Powerful address by Zelenskiy in Russian, to Russians.

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.
