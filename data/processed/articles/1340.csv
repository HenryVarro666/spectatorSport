The European Union agreed Sunday to provide some €500 million in arms and other aid to the Ukrainian military as it battles Russia’s invasion, in a move the bloc described as a “watershed moment” in its history.

The EU’s treaties bar the bloc from using its normal budget to fund operations with military or defense implications. Under the plans announced Sunday, as first reported by POLITICO, the EU will use an off-budget so-called “European Peace Facility” financing instrument with a ceiling of €5 billion that can be used to provide military aid.

“For the first time ever, the EU will finance the purchase and delivery of weapons and other equipment to a country that is under attack,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at a media appearance alongside the EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell. “This is a watershed moment,” she added.

The plan was agreed at an emergency videoconference of EU foreign affairs ministers on Sunday evening.

“Another taboo has fallen,” Borrell said. “The taboo that the EU was not providing arms in a war, yes we are doing it … This war requires our engagement in order to support the Ukrainian army.”

Borrell said the EU had agreed “to provide arms — lethal arms, lethal assistance — to the Ukrainian army for a value of [a] €450 million support package and €50 million more for the non-lethal supplies – [such as] fuel and protective equipment.”

The amount represents 10 percent of the €5 billion allocated to the European Peace Facility for the 2021-2027 budget cycle and “almost all what we can spend for this year,” one diplomat said.

The plans were announced a day after the German government said it would provide lethal weapons to Ukraine — a historic shift by a country that had long prohibited sending such arms into conflict zones.

Von der Leyen and Borrell said the proposal will also strengthen the EU’s previously announced package of measures designed to step up international support for Ukraine by imposing more financial sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, like removing “selected Russian banks” from the SWIFT international payments system.

The EU is also set to shut down its airspace for Russian planes — following similar moves made by most EU countries — and ban what von der Leyen called the Kremlin’s “media machine,” referring to state-owned outlets like Russia Today and Sputnik, as well as their subsidiaries.

Sanctions will also be strengthened against Belarus and Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, a close Russian ally, with restrictive measures affecting the country’s mineral, fuels, tobacco and steel sectors, and “those Belarusians helping the Russian war effort,” von der Leyen added.

The aid will be financed by the EU's European Peace Facility and will see the bloc supply arms to a country at war for the first time in its history.

Another 50 million euros will be provided for non-lethal purposes, Borrell said at a press conference in Brussels Sunday (Feb 27).

The EU's military aid package may include supplying fighter jets for the Ukrainian air force, Borrell said.

Borrell said the EU has already had discussions with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba about the type of jets the Ukrainian military needs and there are member states that are able to supply them.

Member states that don't want to be associated with contributing lethal weapons will be able to abstain or make a parallel contribution of non-lethal aid.

BRUSSELS, Feb 28 (Reuters) - The European Union has broken a ""taboo"" by agreeing for the first time to jointly finance weapons deliveries to a third country to help Ukraine fend off the Russian invasion, EU Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell has said.

European defence ministers met via video-conference on Monday to coordinate the deliveries of the arms, which began to arrive in Ukraine over the weekend.

* The EU will use a special fund, set up in March 2021, called the European Peace Facility (EPF) to pay for the arms. The Facility has a total of 5 billion euros ($5.59 billion) to be provided directly by EU countries proportionate to the size of their gross national income until 2027. It sits outside the EU budget.

* The EU will provide 450 million euros for weapons for Ukraine and 50 million euros for non-lethal equipment from the EPF.

* The EPF replaced the earlier ""Athena mechanism"" and the African Peace Facility that the EU had, broadening the scope of help the EU can provide globally. It allows the EU to provide military equipment and training.

* In the non-lethal category, the EU expects to pay for fuel, ballistic helmets, personal protective equipment and first aid kits. In the lethal weapons category it expects ammunition, munitions, air defence systems and anti-tank systems.

EU countries have pledged or provided the following so far:

* Germany - 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger surface-to-air missiles

* Luxembourg - 100 NLAW anti-tank weapons, jeeps and 15 military tents as well as air transport capacity

* Belgium - 2,000 machine guns, 3,800 tons of fuel

* Netherlands - 200 Stinger missiles

* Poland - 100 mortars, 8 drones, Javelin anti-tank weapons, Grot assault rifles, munitions

* Slovakia - 12,000 pieces of artillery ammunition (120mm), 10 million litres of fuel, 2.4 million litres of aviation fuel and 2 Bozena de-mining systems

* Estonia - Javelin anti-tank weapons (number not disclosed)

* Latvia - Stinger surface to air missiles (number not disclosed)

* Czech Republic - machine guns, assault rifles, other light weapons and ammunition worth 188 million crowns ($8.57 million)

“Another taboo has fallen these days – the taboo that the EU cannot use its resources to provide arms to a country that is being aggressed by another,” EU’s chief diplomat Josep Borrell said as EU foreign ministers met to green-light the unprecedented step.

EU treaties prohibit the bloc from using its regular multiannual budget to fund operations with military or defence implications.

That is why, under the unveiled plans, the EU will use an off-budget so-called ‘European Peace Facility’ (EPF) financing instrument with a ceiling of €5 billion that can be used to provide military aid.

The only recently created intergovernmental fund had opened the door for the bloc to deliver military aid to partner countries and finance the deployment of its military missions abroad.

Borrell said the EU had agreed “to provide arms — lethal arms, lethal assistance — to the Ukrainian army for a value of €450 million support package and €50 million more for the non-lethal supplies – fuel and protective equipment.”

The EPF would be used to coordinate shipments and other logistics.

EU defence ministers will meet virtually on Monday (28 January) to iron out the technical details of the mechanism.

The EU in December already decided to start providing security aid to Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova from this year under the instrument.

“For the first time ever, the EU will finance the purchase and delivery of weapons and other equipment to a country that is under attack,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Sunday (28 February).

“This is a watershed moment,” she added.

Yesterday, at a joint briefing, Borrell and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that for the first time, the EU would provide funds to arm a third country, “a country under attack”.

At an extraordinary online meeting, the foreign ministers of the member states unanimously agreed that the EU should send deadly weapons to Ukraine worth BGN 450 million, Borrell said.

The assistance will be funded by the EU's European Peace Instrument (EPF).

Strict International Sanctions against Russia and EU Arms Shipments for Ukraine

Another BGN 50 million will be used for non-lethal weapons. Member States that do not wish to be involved in the purchase of these weapons will opt for the second type of weapon.

According to him, the EU finance ministers will meet today to assess how to implement today's political decision to provide 450 million euros in military aid to Ukraine.

Poland has agreed to transport weapons across the country.

Borrell also said that Ukraine has requested and will receive from EU countries fighter jets that Ukrainian military pilots can use.

He described as “great irresponsibility” Putin's statement about bringing the nuclear forces into a ""special regime"".

Putin has Ordered the Deployment of Nuclear Deterrence Forces

“We live in a historical time. This definition is often misused, but today is the time because, for the first time since World War II, there has been an invasion of military power in another sovereign state in violation of international order. And because Europeans have reacted in a way that surprised many, especially the Russian side. Maybe today's crisis will help us move forward. This is a crucial hour in European history, the page is turning. It is time to act unitedly and quickly. We must be ready to defend peace in Europe.” Said Borrell.

Only some banks will be excluded from the SWIFT system, he said. Their exact number will become clear today. In other words, “Russia cannot be scissor-cut off the SWIFT system.”

Borrell said half of Russia's central bank assets would be frozen.

The Russian Ruble Collapsed by 30% against the Dollar

“We cannot block the assets of the Russian central bank, which are in Moscow or China. Over the years, Russia has directed its assets to banks in countries whose assets the EU cannot block. Russia has been preparing financially for a situation like this.”

He added that most of these reserves are not in dollars but in euros and yuan.
