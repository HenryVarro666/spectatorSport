0,ba7cdc31-2f8f-4c9e-abfa-3660becb42ed,[],2022-02-11 00:00:00,"The measure convening the General Assembly session was adopted by a vote of 11 in favor, with Russia voting against, and China, India and the United Arab Emirates abstaining.

Today’s request for urgent by the Assembly comes after Russia vetoed on Friday a US-led draft Security Council resolution that would have ‘deplored in the strongest terms the Russian Federation’s aggression against Ukraine’.

Since the text was procedural, none of the five permanent Council members – China France, Russia, United Kingdom and the United States – could use their vetoes. The measure needed only nine votes in favor to pass.

Uniting for Peace

Only 10 such emergency special sessions of the General Assembly have been convened since 1950, following the adoption of resolution 377A(V), widely known as ‘Uniting for Peace.’

That text gives the Assembly the power to take up matters of international peace and security when the Security Council is unable to act because of the lack of unanimity among its five veto-wielding permanent members.

Next steps

Following statements by countries in the emergency special session, the General Assembly is expected to vote on a resolution similar to the one taken up Friday by the Security Council. While Assembly resolutions are non-binding, they are considered to carry political weight as they express the will of the wider UN membership.

The Security Council’s latest steps to end the Ukraine crisis cap a week of activity at the United Nations seeking a diplomatic offramp to Russian military action in the country, including near daily press stakeouts by the Secretary-General, four emergency Council sessions, and one earlier meeting of General Assembly, which saw speaker after speaker call for de-escalation.

On Saturday, amid reports of casualties and people fleeing their homes to seek safety as Russian military operations in the country intensified, the Secretary-General announced that the UN will launch an appeal to fund its humanitarian operations in Ukraine.

A readout issued by a UN spokesperson said that UN chief António Guterres had spoken on the phone with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and conveyed “the... determination of the United Nations to enhance humanitarian assistance to the people of Ukraine.”

The Secretary-General's phone call and announcement of a humanitarian appeal followed his earlier decision to release $20 million from the UN emergency relief fund, known as CERF, to meet urgent needs in Ukraine.

In addition, the Secretary-General announced the appointment of Amin Awad as UN Crisis Coordinator for Ukraine to lead the coordination of all UN efforts, including its humanitarian response, on both sides of the contact line.

Accountability for a ‘war of choice’

Speaking after the vote, Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, of the United States, one of the countries that had requested the meeting, said the Security Council had today taken an important step towards holding Russia accountable for its aggression against Ukraine.

“By calling for an emergency special session of the General Assembly... [we] have recognized that this is no ordinary moment and that we need to take extraordinary steps to confront this threat to our international system,” she said, stressing that such a meeting of the wider UN membership was important to make their voices heard on “Russia’s war of choice.”

While noting that all UN Member States would have the ability to participate in the special emergency session, Ms. Thomas-Greenfield said that she understood that this would take courage for some.

But for inspiration and strength, they could look no further than the Ukrainian people, “who are standing bravely...to defend democracy, while continuing to express willingness to participate in negotiations. So let us do everything we can to help the people of Ukraine as they stand up for themselves, their sovereign country and their children.”

Ambassador Ferit Hoxha of Albania, which had also called for today’s meeting, said that while the vote had been purely procedural, the text itself was one of “historical proportions. One which would open the 'big doors' of the General Assembly, the place where all the world meets” and countries could speak out against an unprovoked war and in favour of the UN Charter, “including Russian citizens who need to listen to the world and hear what it is saying.”

“All Member States, including small ones like mine, must remember that the UN Charter is our best friend, our best army and best defense,” he said. Russia could at any moment come back to its senses, stop the war, pull back its troops and “go back to talks – real talks for peace, not for surrender and capitulation. But this needs lucidity, courage and wisdom, not threats for apocalypse.”

“As we said last Friday, this is not a time to stay idle or look away. It is time to stand up. Ukraine and Ukrainians are resisting,” he concluded.

French Ambassador Nicolas de Rivière, said that Russia had 'stood alone' Friday in blocking a resolution that would have called for an end to its aggression. “This [Assembly] special session is a necessary new step intended to defend the UN Charter and international law and put an end to the aggression against Ukraine,” he said.

He noted that President Emmanuel Macron had called for another meeting the Security Council on Monday at which France along with Mexico would submit a resolution to demand the end of hostilities, protection of civilians, a safe and unhindered humanitarian access to meet the urgent needs of the population. The international community had a duty to stand up for unity and the primacy of international law, he said.

Council’s failure to face the truth

Vasily Nebenzya, Ambassador of the Russian Federation, said that he had voted against the resolution because its authors would note that the Security Council had been unable to carry out its primary duty to maintain international peace and security.

“Yet, at the same time, we did not see even a hint of an attempt to find a constructive solution in the Council. After all, two days ago we blocked one text for the very reason that it was one-sided and unbalanced. We have not seen any new initiatives,” he stressed.

He also denounced attempts by the draft’s sponsors to use their position on the Security Council to push through decisions against other members. “That is why the Council provides for the right to block decisions for permanent members. This is not a privilege, but a tool to ensure the balance of interests so necessary for the whole world, and through it, global stability.”

“Now there is a need to focus on resolving the roots of the crisis with which we are grappling,” he continued, stressing that it was not the launch of the ‘special military operation', but the fact that the Council had for eight years turned a blind eye to the actions of Ukrainian nationalists in the Donbas.

He said that an “information war” was now being unleashed against Russia and that social networks were rife with lies about what was happening in Ukraine. “I urge our colleagues not to contribute to the spread of such misinformation, although I am afraid these calls will not be heard again.”

Air raids, aggression and ‘absurd claims’

Ukraine’s Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya expressed gratitude to those that had supported the request for an emergency special session of the Assembly. For those who had not supported the request, including Russia, he said they should know that the most frequently heard warning in Ukraine today was ‘Attention. Air raids. Please proceed to shelters.'

He also asked those that had not supported the text to please look at videos and pictures of the damage circulating in the media. The truth of what was happening on the ground due to Russia’s aggression could be found there.

He went on to say that Ukraine had issued an order to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to undertake provisional measures against Russia and was seeking an emergency hearing. The Court had jurisdiction to hear the case, owing to international obligations under the Convention on the Prevention of Genocide.

“The Genocide Convention is one of the most important international treaties, drafted in response to the horrors of World War II and the Holocaust. Russia, however, has twisted the concept of genocide, and perverted the solemn treaty obligation to prevent and punish genocide,” the Ambassador explained.

He went on to note that Russia had made an “absurd and unfounded claim” of alleged genocide as a justification and pretext for its own aggression against Ukraine and violation of the sovereignty and human rights of the Ukrainian People. “Ukraine’s case before the ICJ will establish that Russia’s aggression against Ukraine is based on a lie and a gross violation of international law and must be stopped.,” he declared.",https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/02/1112842

An affront to UN principles

Mr. Shahid cited the UN Charter, the Organization’s founding document, which outlines a world where countries settle disputes by peaceful means, without the threat or use of force.

“The ongoing military offensive is inconsistent with this. It is an affront to the founders of this Organization and everything it stands for,” he said.

“The violence must stop. Humanitarian law and international humanitarian law must be respected. And diplomacy and dialogue must prevail.”

Countries observed a minute of silence during the rare emergency special session, which followed a meeting by the Security Council on Sunday.

Council members voted in favour of the General Assembly convening after Russia vetoed a resolution on Friday that would have deplored the assault on Ukraine.

The General Assembly has only held 10 emergency sessions since 1950, in line with the adoption of resolution 377A(V), widely known as ‘Uniting for Peace’.

The resolution gives the Assembly power to take up matters of international peace and security when the Security Council is unable to act due to unanimity among its five permanent members – China, France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Russia – who have the power of veto.

Potential 'ray of hope'

“As we convene here in the General Assembly, negotiators from both sides are holding talks in Belarus,” Mr. Shahid told ambassadors.

“This offers a ray of hope. We pray that these talks will calm down tempers and pave way to peace.”

Addressing the UN membership, Secretary-General António Guterres stated that the fighting in Ukraine must stop.

The bombardment of cities such as the capital, Kyiv, has forced people to seek shelter, including in subway stations. Roughly half a million Ukrainians have also crossed the country’s borders.

See full remarks here

'Enough is enough'

Mr. Guterres said that although Russian strikes are reportedly largely targeting Ukrainian military facilities, “we have credible accounts of residential buildings, critical civilian infrastructure and other non-military targets sustaining heavy damage.”

Civilians, including children, have been killed in the violence.

“Enough is enough,” the Secretary-General said. “Soldiers need to move back to their barracks. Leaders need to move to peace. Civilians must be protected. International humanitarian and human rights law must be upheld.”

The world is facing what is a tragedy for Ukraine, he added, but also a major regional crisis with potentially disastrous implications for all.

""Yesterday, Russian nuclear forces were put on high alert. This is a chilling development. The mere idea of a nuclear conflict is simply inconceivable. Nothing can justify the use of nuclear weapons,"" he said.

Mr. Guterres underlined the UN’s commitment to Ukraine, reminding that last week he had allocated $20 million from a UN humanitarian fund to support emergency operations, in addition to appointing a Crisis Coordinator for the country.

“At the same time, we are bringing together partners, in and outside the country – and surging personnel into the country,” he continued.

Humanitarian appeals

The UN will also launch two coordinated emergency appeals for Ukraine and the region on Tuesday.

One will address escalating humanitarian needs inside the country, including rising internal displacement, while the other will respond to the needs of people who have fled elsewhere.

International peace at stake: Ukraine

Ukraine's Ambassador, Sergiy Kyslytsya, remarked that for the first time since the UN was established, a full-fledged war was unfolding in the centre of Europe.

Some 352 Ukrainians, including 16 children have been killed to date, he reported, while more than 2,000 were injured.

He said now is the time to help his country.

“If Ukraine does not survive, international peace will not survive,” Mr. Kyslytsya told the General Assembly.

“If Ukraine does not survive, the United Nations will not survive, have no illusions. If Ukraine does not survive, we cannot be surprised if democracy fails next,” he added.

Russian actions ‘distorted’: UN Ambassador

Speaking through an interpreter, Russian Ambassadsor Vasily Nebenzya said the actions of his country are being “distorted and thwarted”, with media and social networks proliferating what he called “these lies”.

The goal of the special military operation is to protect people in Luhansk and Donetsk, two regions in eastern Ukraine, “who for eight years were subject to torment and genocide by the Kyiv regime,” he said.

“To that end, there is a need to demilitarize and de-nazify Ukraine.”

Mr. Nebenzya said Russia believes the UN can play a role in addressing the Ukrainian crisis by helping “to bring stakeholder positions closer together and eradicate the causes of conflict.”

Vote on resolution expected

Some 100 countries are expected to address the General Assembly, which is scheduled to vote on a draft resolution on Ukraine, tentatively expected on Wednesday.

Although Assembly resolutions are non-binding, they are considered to carry political weight as they express the will of the wider UN membership.

UNITED NATIONS, Feb 27 (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council on Sunday called for a rare emergency special session of the 193-member General Assembly on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which will be held on Monday, as western allies step up a diplomatic campaign to isolate Moscow.

The vote by the 15-member council was procedural so Russia could not wield its veto. A resolution convening the General Assembly session was adopted with 11 yes votes. Russia voted no, while China, India and the United Arab Emirates abstained.

""The members of this council have laid bare Russia's diplomatic impotence. Russia again was isolated,"" Britain's U.N. Ambassador Barbara Woodward said. ""Russia cannot stop the world from coming together to condemn its invasion of Ukraine.""

The move is the latest in a flurry of diplomacy at the United Nations in New York. It follows a Russian veto on Friday of a draft council resolution that would have deplored Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

China, India and the United Arab Emirates abstained and the remaining 11 members voted yes. read more

The General Assembly is expected to vote on a similar resolution as soon as Wednesday, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said. No country has a veto in the General Assembly.

""Russia cannot veto our voices. Russia cannot veto the Ukrainian people. And Russia cannot veto the U.N. Charter. Russia cannot, and will not, veto accountability,"" said U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield.

While General Assembly resolutions are non-binding, they carry political weight. The United States and allies see action at the United Nations as a chance to show Russia is isolated because of its invasion of neighboring Ukraine.

They will be looking to improve on the 100 countries who voted in favor of a General Assembly resolution in March 2014 after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region. That resolution declared invalid a referendum on the status of Crimea.

The vote will be come at the end of the emergency special session. It will only be the 11th such General Assembly session convened since 1950.

Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said of the Security Council votes on Friday and Sunday: ""Any attempt to circumvent the position of a Russian Federation, any attempt to disregard it, undermines the very bedrock of the U.N. Charter.""

The Security Council is also set to meet again on Monday for a briefing on humanitarian needs of civilians in Ukraine. It will be the 5th council meeting on Ukraine in the past week.

French U.N. Ambassador Nicolas de Riviere said France would put forward a draft council resolution ""to demand the end of hostilities, protection of civilians, and safe and unhindered humanitarian access to meet the urgent needs of the population."" He said it could be voted on as early as Tuesday.

Russia would be in a position to block the move if it chooses. It is a council veto power along with the United States, France, Britain and China.

Thomas-Greenfield also called on the Kremlin to turn down its nuclear rhetoric, referencing Putin ordering Russian nuclear forces on high alert. She said earlier on Sunday on CBS’ “Face the Nation” that she wasn’t surprised by the Russian autocrat’s language “because Putin has tried every means possible to actually put fear in the world.”

The Ukrainian representative brought up Putin’s nuclear rhetoric at the Security Council meeting Sunday, saying, “The world must take this threat very seriously.”

The ambassador, Sergiy Kyslytsya, described the death and destruction in his country as a result of Russian aggression, saying he will work with UNICEF on the issue.

Kyslytsya switched to Russian at the end of his remarks, saying: “To conclude, I wish to turn personally to the ambassador of the Russian federation,” and asking him to stop defending Kremlin aggression.

“There is always place in life for choices. There are always options,” the Ukrainian ambassador said to end his speech. “For example, one can remain a human being, a person, or they can continue to defend evil. And this is a choice which lies with every individual, always.”

The Russian representative claimed in his remarks after the vote that “The Security Council failed to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.”

He continued ongoing Kremlin rhetoric that the attack was due to “crimes” propagated by Ukraine in Donbas, which the Russian government has claimed as an excuse for attacks. “We did not see even a hint of an attempt to reach a constructive solution of the council,” the representative said, calling the resolution “one-sided” and “imbalanced.”

There will be another emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Monday, after French President Emmanuel Macron requested it and Mexico joined on the resolution. The Mexican ambassador to the U.N. said the meeting will be used to analyze the humanitarian situation in Ukraine. “France will, alongside Mexico, submit a draft resolution in order to guarantee unfettered humanitarian access to meet the urgent needs of the people in Ukraine,” the French representative said.

Five countries (the U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France) have veto power in the Security Council, but since November 1950, any nation has been able to call for an emergency session of the General Assembly despite a no vote from one of the five. That measure was enacted during the Korean War, a time in which those five nations rarely agreed on anything.",https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/27/un-general-assembly-emergency-session-russian-invasion-00012155

UNEP partnered with Antigua & Barbuda, AOSIS, Belgium, Bhutan, Colombia, Costa Rica, EU, France, Gabon, UK, Vietnam, UNDP and others for this high-level event to showcase action to protect, conserve, sustainably use and restore nature and close the finance gap.

23 September, 2021 | UN Food Systems Summit

The event was held during the UN General Assembly in New York and took the form of a virtual event. The aim of the Summit was to deliver progress on all 17 of the SDGs through a food systems approach, leveraging the interconnectedness of food systems to global challenges such as hunger, climate change, poverty and inequality. More information about the 2021 UN Food Systems Summit and list of Advisory Committee and Scientific Group members can be found online: https://www.un.org/foodsystemssummit

24 September, 2021 | High Level Dialogue on Energy

The High-level Dialogue on Energy (HLDE) was the first global gathering on energy held under the auspices of the General Assembly since the 1981 UN Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy. This was a Heads of State / Government event about SDG7 on energy and its three goals of universal access to modern energy, renewable energy, and energy efficiency. UNEP has been involved since the beginning, assuming responsibility for preparing with IRENA and UNESCAP the Thematic Background Report on the Energy Transition (one of five thematic reports) and on organizing the ministerial level Energy Transition thematic day in June.

UNEP has pressed that expanded energy access to meet needs in unserved populations and climate change mitigation are not incompatible; and that the HLDE should support greater climate ambition at COP26. This link to the climate change COP is even more pressing given the IPCC report just released.

The U.S. and Albania requested a Sunday Security Council meeting to vote to convene the emergency General Assembly session, the first of its kind in 40 years and only the 11th such session in U.N. history.

The 15-member Security Council approved the General Assembly emergency session on Sunday with only Russia voting against it. Russia's no vote did not prevent the measure from being adopted, since it was a procedural vote. Russia's presidency of the Council — which alternates among Council members monthly — ends on Monday.

At the special session, leaders condemned Russia's military attacks on Ukraine. Switzerland, which traditionally stays neutral and has been known as a safe haven for global finance, announced that it will impose the same sanctions as the European Union and blocked the travel of five oligarchs close to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Switzerland's Ambassador to the U.N. Pascale Baeriswyl said that her country will also support the General Assembly draft resolution that condemns Russia.

""Each life lost is one too many, we express our solidarity with the people of Ukraine,"" she said.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who has been so outspoken that Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he was speaking out of turn, told diplomats on Monday that ""The guns are talking now, but the path of dialogue must always remain open, we need peace now.""

Ukraine's Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya was the most somber: ""Have no illusions. If Ukraine does not survive, we cannot be surprised if democracy fails next.""

Poland's U.N. Ambassador Krzysztof Szczerski said that he is most proud of his country's readiness to help Ukranians seeking to flee. ""Polish families are opening their homes to refugees,"" he said.

""Poland may not be a geopolitical superpower but we want to be a solidarity superpower,"" Szczerski said.

Russia's Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia repeated the Russian Federation position that Russia did not start the conflict. Nebenzia received a phone call during the press conference with the news that the U.S. Mission to the U.N. is expelling 12 diplomats from Russia's Mission to the U.N.

A spokesperson for the U.S. Mission said the 12 were expelled because they ""abused their privileges of residency in the U.S. by engaging in espionage activities that are adverse to our national security."" The spokesperson said the action ""has been in the works for several months.""

The meetings come after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian nuclear deterrent forces put on alert Sunday in response to what he called ""aggressive statements"" by leading NATO powers.

General Assembly action, which is unenforceable, is intended to show that the global community is shocked by the unprovoked attack by Russia on Ukraine, the U.K., France and the U.S. said.

On Sunday, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield commended the Security Council's decision to hold the emergency session.

""The Council members who supported this resolution recognize that this is no ordinary moment,"" Greenfield said. ""We need to take extraordinary actions to meet this threat to our international system and do everything we can to help Ukraine and its people. President Putin put Russia's nuclear forces on high alert, even though he is invading a country with no nuclear weapons and is under no threat from NATO.""

To Russian officers and soldiers, Thomas-Greenfield said: ""The world is watching.""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/united-nations-general-assembly-ukraine-russia-emergency-session/

The meeting will be convened on Monday, and is set to give all 193 members of the global body the opportunity to express their views on the invasion.

Russia voted against the resolution, but under UN regulations it did not have veto power to derail the referral of the war to the General Assembly.

The procedure is allowed under a 1950 resolution called ""Uniting for Peace.""

It allows for members of the Security Council to seize the General Assembly for a special session if the five permanent members -- Russia, the United States, Britain, France and China -- fail to agree among themselves to act together to maintain peace.

The move was sparked by Russia on Friday using its veto to block a Security Council resolution that condemned Moscow's invasion and called for the immediate withdrawal of its troops.

Only the support of nine of the council's 15 members is required to call an emergency special session of the General Assembly.

Eleven countries voted in favor. Russia opposed, while the United Arab Emirates, China and India abstained.

It will just be the 11th such session that the assembly has held, according to diplomats.

The discussion is expected to highlight the extent of Russia's isolation in the international community over the invasion of Ukraine.

""The council members who supported this resolution recognize that this is no ordinary moment,"" said US ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield.

""These are issues that affect all member states and now in the General Assembly they can all make their voices heard on Russia's war of choice,"" she added.

Monday's session is scheduled to start at 10:00 am in New York (1500 GMT) and is expected to last at least all day.

On Monday, the Security Council is scheduled to hold at 5:00 pm an emergency meeting on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine.

During the rare emergency special session — just the 11th the Assembly has held in the United Nations’ 77-year history — Russia defended its decision to invade its neighbor as member state after member state made a plea for peace.

“The fighting in Ukraine must stop,” warned UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, after the session began with a minute of silence for the victims of the conflict. “Enough is enough. Soldiers need to move back to their barracks. Leaders need to move to peace. Civilians must be protected,” he pleaded.

More than 100 countries were expected to speak as the global body decides if it will support the resolution that demands Russia immediately withdraws its troops from Ukraine. The resolution is non-binding, but will serve as a marker of how isolated Russia is.

A vote may not come until Tuesday. Its authors hope they may exceed 100 votes in favor, including Israel — though countries including Syria, China, Cuba and India are expected to either support Russia or abstain.

It will be seen as a barometer of democracy in a world where autocratic sentiment has been on the rise, diplomats said, pointing to such regimes in Myanmar, Sudan, Mali, Burkina Faso, Venezuela, Nicaragua — and, of course, Russia.

“If Ukraine does not survive, the United Nations will not survive. Have no illusions,” said Ukraine’s ambassador to the UN, Sergiy Kyslytsya, imploring countries to support the resolution. “We can save Ukraine, save the United Nations, save democracy and defend the values we believe in.”

Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia reiterated Moscow’s stance — flatly rejected by Kyiv and its Western allies — that its military operation was launched to protect residents of breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine.

“The hostilities were unleashed by Ukraine against its own residents,” he said from the podium. “Russia is seeking to end this war,” he added.

Assembly president Abdulla Shahid led all of the UN’s 193 members in the moment of meditation before calling for “an immediate ceasefire.”

“Nothing can justify the use of nuclear weapons. The guns are talking now, but the path of dialogue must always remain open,” he pleaded.

If Moscow wins in Ukraine, the international order could be “changed forever,” one senior diplomat told AFP on condition of anonymity, underscoring the gravity of the moment at the body charged with global peace and security.

Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24.

Since then Russia has become an international pariah as its forces do battle on the streets of Ukraine’s cities, facing a barrage of sanctions including a ban from Western airspace and key financial networks.

On Sunday, Putin ordered Russia’s nuclear “deterrence forces” onto high alert, prompting an international outcry, with the United States calling the order “totally unacceptable.”

Russia has pleaded “self-defense” under Article 51 of the UN Charter.

But that has been roundly rejected by Western countries and the UN, which accuse Moscow of violating Article 2 of the Charter, requiring its members to refrain from the threat or use of force to resolve a crisis.

‘No ordinary moment’

The move to hold the emergency session was sparked by Russia on Friday using its veto to block a Security Council resolution that condemned Moscow’s invasion and called for the immediate withdrawal of its troops.

Russia voted against the resolution, but it did not have veto power to derail the referral of the war to the General Assembly, allowed under a 1950 resolution called “Uniting for Peace.”

It allows for members of the Security Council to seize the General Assembly for a special session if the five permanent members — Russia, the US, Britain, France and China — fail to agree to act together to maintain peace.

Only the support of nine of the council’s 15 members is required to call an emergency special session of the General Assembly.

Eleven countries voted in favor. Russia opposed, while the United Arab Emirates, China and India abstained.

“The council members who supported this resolution recognize that this is no ordinary moment,” said US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield.

Separately Monday, the Security Council is scheduled to hold an emergency meeting on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, where up to seven million people are expected to flee the fighting.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/isolated-russia-faces-rare-un-emergency-session-on-its-invasion-of-ukraine/

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) -The United Nations Security Council on Sunday called for a rare emergency special session of the 193-member General Assembly on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which will be held on Monday, as western allies step up a diplomatic campaign to isolate Moscow.

The vote by the 15-member council was procedural so Russia could not wield its veto. A resolution convening the General Assembly session was adopted with 11 yes votes. Russia voted no, while China, India and the United Arab Emirates abstained.

""The members of this council have laid bare Russia's diplomatic impotence. Russia again was isolated,"" Britain's U.N. Ambassador Barbara Woodward said. ""Russia cannot stop the world from coming together to condemn its invasion of Ukraine.""

The move is the latest in a flurry of diplomacy at the United Nations in New York. It follows a Russian veto on Friday of a draft council resolution that would have deplored Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

China, India and the United Arab Emirates abstained and the remaining 11 members voted yes.

The General Assembly is expected to vote on a similar resolution as soon as Wednesday, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said. No country has a veto in the General Assembly.

""Russia cannot veto our voices. Russia cannot veto the Ukrainian people. And Russia cannot veto the U.N. Charter. Russia cannot, and will not, veto accountability,"" said U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield.

While General Assembly resolutions are non-binding, they carry political weight. The United States and allies see action at the United Nations as a chance to show Russia is isolated because of its invasion of neighboring Ukraine.

They will be looking to improve on the 100 countries who voted in favor of a General Assembly resolution in March 2014 after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region. That resolution declared invalid a referendum on the status of Crimea.

The vote will be come at the end of the emergency special session. It will only be the 11th such General Assembly session convened since 1950.

Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said of the Security Council votes on Friday and Sunday: ""Any attempt to circumvent the position of a Russian Federation, any attempt to disregard it, undermines the very bedrock of the U.N. Charter.""

The Security Council is also set to meet again on Monday for a briefing on humanitarian needs of civilians in Ukraine. It will be the 5th council meeting on Ukraine in the past week.

French U.N. Ambassador Nicolas de Riviere said France would put forward a draft council resolution ""to demand the end of hostilities, protection of civilians, and safe and unhindered humanitarian access to meet the urgent needs of the population."" He said it could be voted on as early as Tuesday.

Russia would be in a position to block the move if it chooses. It is a council veto power along with the United States, France, Britain and China.
