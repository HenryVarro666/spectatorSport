Russian air and missile attacks have all of Ukraine within range. Even in cities that are far from Ukraine's front lines, air raid sirens go off multiple times a day.

Residents take cover in churches, in the basements of buildings, and in underground metro stations. Sometimes, there isn't time, and they rush away from what they gamble might be seen as obvious targets.

2,2dbb1fd2-7a36-4fb0-9ec3-c26378c8eb57,[],,"KYIV, Ukraine (AFP) — It was hard to tell what scared the elderly women more: the piercing peal of air raid sirens or the terrified urgency of the Ukrainian soldier who ordered everyone to run for cover.

“Everyone! Immediately! Now!” the soldier screamed as he dashed in his heavy boots across a road scattered with the exploded remains of grenades and shells.

Behind him stood the charred skeleton of a Ukrainian military truck that was hit while ferrying ordnance to a flashpoint district of northern Kyiv.

Before him were elderly women with handbags and middle-aged men chatting about the war while blowing out cigarette smoke.

And above them — somewhere in the ominous distance — was the swooshing sound of either mortars or Grad missiles being fired in a barrage on Ukraine’s capital.

The passers-by all ran around the corner of a building and down a dark flight of stairs leading into a concrete basement.

Already waiting for them was a sheltering group of exhausted people who had come desperately close to getting out of Kyiv on the third day of Russia’s invasion of their country.

“We were trying to evacuate, but half-way down the road, they started shelling,” IT engineer Helga Tarasova said.

She had taken a bus to Kyiv train station with her young son and several friends. Their next stops were supposed to be the western Ukrainian city of Lviv and then — possibly — Poland.

“We only had 800 meters [half a mile] to go until the station,” the 36-year-old recalled, while bouncing her son on her knee. “But the national guard would not let us through. We were running with our bags and I think the bags scared them.”

The Ukrainian capital is under siege. It entered a weekend curfew on Saturday evening that is being enforced with shoot-on-sight orders.

Residents have started taping over exposed window panes and covering up street names, building numbers and other identifiable city markings to try to confuse the invading Russian force.

Long lines that run dozens of cars deep snake around the few functioning petrol stations. Grocery stores are either closed or packed with people staring at grimly bare shelves that are often out of bread and simple meats and cheese.

One soldier was digging a trench on the side of a highway that the Russian tanks are expected to use to push toward Kyiv’s Maidan Square and the government district.

“We were hoping that our generation would be the one that lives without war,” pensioner Tetyana Filonemko lamented, in the basement. “All the people can do in a war is hold on, be as one, support each other. That’s all we can do.”

Filonemko’s basement is split into three rooms connected by a narrow corridor and lit by incandescent bulbs hanging off black wires.

One man slept on a yoga mat arranged atop a few wooden planks. A bucket stood beside him on a wooden stool. Other men paced and some women whispered. The children seemed the least concerned in their play corner.

“All I can think about is the children,” said Nadezhda Tkachuk.

The 58-year-old had just walked up the stairs and popped her head out of the door for a quick breath of fresh air — and to try to hear how close the fighting had come. “Let them open a corridor, so that they don’t shoot at people, so that we can send the little kids out,” she said.

But Yulia Snitka has even more immediate concerns.

The 32-year-old’s belly bulged through her clothes on the eighth month of pregnancy and she is worried about being worried.

“I’m trying to stay as calm as possible to not cause a premature birth,” she said. “At night, for more than an hour, there were huge explosions. I hope this all ends in a few days.”",https://www.timesofisrael.com/immediately-now-terrified-citizens-rush-for-kyiv-basements-amid-air-raid-sirens/

KYIV, Feb 26 (Reuters) - An air raid siren was heard in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv at about 11:20 a.m. (0920 GMT), a Reuters correspondent reported.

Ukrainian authorities said earlier on Saturday that a residential building in the city had been hit by a missile.

Ukrainian media reported explosions and a gunfight in a nearby town.

According to Ukrainian news website Segodnya.ua, a bridge has been blown up near the town of Bucha west of Kyiv. It was unclear whether it had been bombed by Russian troops or destroyed by the Ukrainian side.

Anton Herashchenko, an advisor to Ukraine's interior minister, said fighting was under way in Bucha with Russian forces that were trying to advance towards Kyiv.

We had been told that an invasion of Ukraine by Russia was possible, but it had seemed fantastical.

A crazy move. An invasion of a European nation after years of posturing.

But here we are.

It started before dawn, but I didn't hear the first distant explosion, I was fast asleep. The rest of my team most certainly did though.

We made our way outside as Ukrainians started waking to massive explosions around the capital Kyiv - it was the same across the country.

Russia-Ukraine crisis: 'Full-scale invasion' - what do we know so far?

As we walked up the hill towards a beautiful church and viewpoint that was to be our live location for the next few hours, we saw people coming out of their homes, gazing in disbelief at what was happening.

It's fair to say explicit warnings that this invasion would happen had probably been taken with a pinch of salt by the local population.

Over the past few weeks many had told us that nothing would happen, that it was all a bluff by Russia - a bluff that Russia had played many times since this conflict first began in 2014 with a separatist uprising in eastern Ukraine.

Analysis: Inside the mind of Vladimir Putin - why is he invading and what does he want?

Despite the explosions and flashes in the sky, we could see commuters making their way into the capital as normal, across bridges and on motorways.

It was surreal. But it wasn't normal, and within hours that traffic had stopped.

People were suddenly aware of the magnitude of what was happening as air raid sirens blared out across the city.

Officials here said they were just testing the sirens, but nobody believed them.

Above the clouds a fighter jet soared over our heads - we couldn't see, so Russian or Ukrainian we don't know which. But the engines were deafeningly loud and unnerving.

How will the UK help in Ukraine's fight against Vladimir Putin?

Streets usually busy with people became suddenly thinned out and quiet, not deserted but fundamentally different to just 24 hours earlier when breakfast cafes, bars and restaurants were open and teeming with people.

You would not have known the war was about to start.

Within hours of the explosions that rocked the city at dawn, it started to become clear a mass exodus was underway.

One man and family told us they tried to get onto a train heading west but that he was giving up and going home. ""Without a car you're stuck,"" he told me.

The main roads heading out of Kyiv towards the west were jammed with traffic.

Miles and miles of queues.

People were getting out of their cars, trying to work out just how long the queue was. Others got out of buses for a break before carrying on.

We met two women who said they and everyone on the buses were heading to the west of the country and maybe then on to Poland hoping to find safety.

Nobody knows what the next few hours, let alone days, will bring here.

In a trendy district of Kyiv young men carrying flags, one with a huge flag attached to his bicycle, took the streets in an effort to support the nation and bolster morale.

They carried the blue and yellow Ukrainian flag with pride.

But in the face of the Russian army and this invasion, there's really not much more that they can do.
