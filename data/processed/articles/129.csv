A high-voltage power line to Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear plant was damaged by Russian forces just one day after electricity supplies were restored to the facility, said grid operator Ukrenergo on Monday.

Meanwhile, more than 160 civilian cars were able to drive out of the besieged southeastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol through a humanitarian corridor after repeated failed attempts at evacuation, the city authorities said on Monday.

The number of deaths in Mariupol, facing acute deprivation amid a prolonged siege, has topped 2,100, officials there said, with some authorities saying it is as high as 2,500 casualties.

While western Ukraine has largely been spared so far, Russian air strikes overnight Saturday into Sunday carried the war deep into the west, killing 35 people and wounding 134 at a military base near the city of Lviv -- which is dangerously close to the frontier with EU and NATO member Poland.

Further, on Monday, the capital Kyiv also saw shelling that killed two while a TV tower strike in western Ukraine reportedly killed nine. Two were also reported dead in Kharkiv.

Russia, on the other hand, claimed that an attack by Kyiv's forces on the separatist region of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine had left 23 people dead, with the military accusing Kyiv of committing a ""war crime"".

Washington and its EU allies have sent funds and military aid to Ukraine and imposed unprecedented economic sanctions on Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is also set to address the full US Congress on Wednesday regarding the war.

Mar 14, 2022 16:20 (IST) Deutsche Bank, London Stock Exchange turn their backs on Russia

Deutsche Bank reversed course and said it would pull out of Russia completely while the London Stock Exchange suspended all its services in the country as Western governments impose sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine.

Deutsche, which had faced stinging criticism from some investors and politicians for its ongoing ties to Russia, said late on Friday that it would wind down its business there.

The surprise move puts the German lender alongside major U.S. banks Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, which exited Russia after the Feb. 24 invasion, and will add to pressure on rivals to follow in severing ties.

Deutsche had argued that it needed to support multinational firms doing business in Russia. But on Friday evening in Frankfurt, the bank suddenly reversed course.

""We are in the process of winding down our remaining business in Russia while we help our non-Russian multinational clients in reducing their operations,"" Deutsche said.

""There won't be any new business in Russia.""

Mar 14, 2022 15:35 (IST) Russians stockpile electronics, pharmacy goods as crisis deepens

Russians rushed to buy electronics and pharmaceuticals and spent more on clothes and food in the first week of March, Promsvyazbank (PSB) said, stockpiling goods as the rouble plunged in value and Western sanctions cut off trade.

Prices for goods have increased across the board since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24, prompting sanctions that have isolated Russia economically and sent the currency to historic lows. Many of the world's top companies have suspended operations in the country and it is largely excluded from the international financial system.

An ordinary Russian spent 21% more in the first week of March compared to the average for February, driven both by inflation and a rush to stockpile, state bank PSB said in a note after analysing credit and debit card transactions.

""The highest number of victims are in the Kyiv, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kherson, Mykolayiv and Zhytomyr regions,"" it said in a statement.

Reuters could not immediately verify the information. Russia denies targeting civilians in what it calls a ""special operation"" to demilitarise and ""deNazify"" Ukraine.

Russia has asked China for military and economic aid for its war in Ukraine, US media reported Sunday, hours after the White House warned Beijing would face severe ""consequences"" if it helps Moscow evade sanctions.

US officials told media that Russia had requested military equipment and support from its key ally.

Moscow also asked Beijing for economic assistance against the crippling sanctions imposed against it by most of the Western world, the New York Times said, again citing anonymous officials.

The officials declined to explain exactly what Russia had requested, or whether China had responded, according to the reports.

Diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine were stepping up on Monday, with Ukrainian and Russian negotiators set to talk again after both sides cited progress, even after Russia attacked a base near the Polish border and fighting raged elsewhere.

A barrage of Russian missiles hit Ukraine's Yavoriv International Centre for Peacekeeping and Security, a base just 15 miles (25 km) from the Polish border that has previously hosted NATO military instructors, killing 35 people and wounding 134, a Ukrainian official said on Sunday.

Russia's defence ministry said up to 180 ""foreign mercenaries"" and a large number of foreign weapons were destroyed. Reuters could not independently verify the casualties reported by either side.

Thousands of people have died since Feb 24, when Russian President Vladimir Putin launched what he called a special military operation to rid Ukraine of dangerous nationalists and Nazis.

Mar 14, 2022 08:32 (IST) Ukraine Has Started Using Facial Recognition Technology During War



Ukraine's defense ministry on Saturday began using Clearview AI's facial recognition technology, the company's chief executive told Reuters, after the U.S. startup offered to uncover Russian assailants, combat misinformation and identify the dead.

Ukraine is receiving free access to Clearview AI's powerful search engine for faces, letting authorities potentially vet people of interest at checkpoints, among other uses, added Lee Wolosky, an adviser to Clearview and former diplomat under U.S. presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden.

The plans started forming after Russia invaded Ukraine and Clearview Chief Executive Hoan Ton-That sent a letter to Kyiv offering assistance, according to a copy seen by Reuters.

7,408e275b-f772-47c6-8a8b-424d28c8bca6,[],,"Former Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, in an interview with Israel’s Channel 13, thanks Israel and Prime Minister Bennett for mediation efforts between Ukraine and Russia.

“We thank your country and your prime minister… for putting yourselves forward as peacemakers. I very much want to believe in this. But at the same time, I am certain that Putin will not stop. He will go on to the end. He wants to win, and take military control of Ukraine, but I can tell you that he won’t achieve this. Ukraine will fight so that victory is ours,” Tymoshenko says.

She says, “I thank Israel for formally declaring today that it stands with Ukraine.”

Israel has not yet made such a formal declaration, however. Tymoshenko appears to be referring to comments yesterday from Foreign Minister Lapid, who said Israel “condemns the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and calls for an end to the fighting.”

“There is no justification for violating Ukraine’s territorial integrity, and there is no justification for attacks on a civilian population,” Lapid said. “Israel will not be a route to bypass sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States and other Western countries.”

Bennett has refrained from taking a side in the conflict, however.

Tymoshenko says, “Today is really a turning point. Today your foreign minister said clearly that Israel will not be a country that allows the aggressor state to evade the sanctions. Nobody can stand in opposition [to Ukraine’s cause]. You have to be without a conscience, heartless and soulless, devoid of any human emotion to see what is happening in Ukraine and not to stand with it.”

Tymoshenko, Ukraine’s only female prime minister, quotes Israel’s only female prime minister, Ukraine-born Golda Meir.

“Regarding negotiations, I want to quote Golda Meir, who was your prime minister and was born in Kyiv. She said, ‘If the enemy lays down his weapons, there will be peace. If we lay down our weapons, there’ll be war.’ We will not lay down our weapons. We will continue to fight. We’ll continue to defend our country. And if peace talks can contribute, and stop the bloodshed, we will rejoice. But we will permit any limitations and any compromises that threaten our independence and territorial integrity.”

“I thank you very much [in Israel] for defending Ukraine,” she says.

Tymoshenko currently serves as a Deputy of Ukraine. She had extensive dealings with Russian President Putin while she was prime minister in 2005, and from 2007-2010.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-march-15-2022/
8,408e275b-f772-47c6-8a8b-424d28c8bca6,[],,"Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba refused to hold a phone call with his Israeli counterpart Yair Lapid due to Israel's position on Ukraine's conflict with Russia, a Ukrainian government official said.

According to the official, Lapid's bureau tried to plan a call, but that Kuleba has not yet agreed to do so. ""He didn't say 'no,' he said that he was busy,"" the source said. He added that the last phone call between the two foreign ministers took place three months ago, long before the Russian invasion.

The official said that Lapid has not yet accepted an invitation to visit Kyiv, which was extended by Ukraine's deputy foreign minister about two weeks before the war.

An Israeli political source believes that the two will indeed speak in the coming days.

Lapid is the highest-ranking Israeli official to criticize the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and has done so at least four times in public declarations.

On Sunday, he took a more severe tone during a visit to Ukraine, saying that ""Israel, like Romania, condemns the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It is unjustifiable and we call on Russia to cease its fire and aggression and to solve its problems at the negotiating table.""
