World economy faces ‘the greatest supply shock since at least the early 1970s’

Ukraine’s GDP forecast to drop by 20 per cent in 2022, Russia’s by 10 percent

The war on Ukraine will have a severe effect on economies far beyond the immediate area of the conflict, according to new research from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).

In its first economic forecast since the war began, the EBRD has cut its growth forecast for 2022 for the regions where it operates by more than half – to 1.7 per cent, down by 2.5 per cent on its previous forecast.

It forecasts sturdier growth across its regions of 5 per cent in 2023.

Describing the effects of the war as ‘the greatest supply shock since at least the early 1970s,’ the Bank predicts that the increased cost for commodities such as food, oil, gas and metals will have a profound impact on economies, particularly those in lower income countries. Russia and Ukraine supply a disproportionately high share of commodities, including wheat, corn, fertiliser, titanium and nickel.

The EBRD works in many emerging economies, stretching across eastern, central and south-eastern Europe, Central Asia, Turkey and the southern and eastern Mediterranean. The new forecasts are based on a series of assumptions about events in the coming months, and therefore have a high degree of uncertainty.

Nevertheless, it is clear that many economies will be severely hit and that some will suffer more than others.

For example, the EBRD expects Ukraine’s GDP to fall by 20 per cent this year and Russia’s by 10 per cent. Ukraine’s GDP had been forecast to grow by 3.5 per cent this year, and Russia’s by 3 per cent.

The EBRD has not been doing new business in Russia since 2014, and earlier this week announced that it had closed its offices in Moscow as well as in Minsk, the capital of Belarus. The Bank has condemned the invasion of Ukraine and announced an initial €2 billion resilience package to support its economy and its affected neighbours.

Areas highlighted by the forecast include:

Economies in Central Asia badly hit by the fall in the value of the rouble and restrictions on its convertibility, as they are heavily dependent on remittances received from Russia.

North African economies and Lebanon greatly exposed to the reduced global supply of wheat, forcing up prices.

Economies in central Europe closely integrated into manufacturing supply chains in Ukraine, with a serious risk of disruption.

Pressures on currencies in the Caucasus and Central Asia as markets have been reassessing geo-political risks

And tourism is expected to take a hit in many countries including Armenia, Estonia, Georgia and Montenegro.

Beata Javorcik, Chief Economist of the EBRD, said: “The war on Ukraine has been having a profound impact on the economies in the EBRD regions as well as globally. Inflationary pressures were already exceptionally high and it seems certain they will now be worse, which will have a disproportionate affect on many of the lower income countries where we work.”

Europe has also seen the greatest force displacement of people since the Second World War, and the report examines the potential consequences of this migration.

Skilled workers from Ukraine may provide a boost to some economies in the longer term, particularly in countries with ageing populations. In the short-term, economies are facing fiscal pressures and administrative challenges as they scale up the provision of housing, healthcare and schooling.

A number of countries have also announced higher targets for military spending since the Russian Federation-led invasion of Ukraine.

The EBRD forecasts assume that a ceasefire is brokered within a couple of months, followed soon after by the start of a major reconstruction effort in Ukraine which will bring GDP by end-2023 back close to, but still below, pre-war levels.

Sanctions on Russia are expected to remain for the foreseeable future, condemning the Russian economy to stagnation in 2023 (after a sharp GDP drop in 2022), with negative spill overs for a number of neighbouring countries in eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia.

With so much uncertainty, the Bank intends to produce a further forecast in the next couple of months, taking into account further developments.

Before Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb 24, the London-based EBRD had predicted that Ukrainian gross domestic product (GDP) would grow by 3.5 per cent this year and that the Russian economy would expand by 3 per cent.

The EBRD said it was the first international financial institution to update growth forecasts since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine in February.

The latest prognoses ""assume that a ceasefire is brokered within a couple of months, followed soon after by the start of a major reconstruction effort in Ukraine"", it said.

Under such a scenario, Ukraine GDP should rebound by 23 per cent next year, while sanctions-hit Russia is set for zero growth.

The EBRD was founded in 1991 to help former Soviet bloc countries switch to free-market economies, but has since extended its reach, including to countries in the Middle East and North Africa.

The bank predicted that its investment zone, excluding Belarus and Russia, would grow by 1.7 per cent this year compared with an earlier growth forecast of 4.2 per cent last November.

Growth is then expected to pick up to 5 per cent in 2023.

""Projections are subject to an exceptionally high degree of uncertainty, including major downside risks should hostilities escalate or should exports of gas or other commodities from Russia become restricted,"" it cautioned.

The world economy faced ""the greatest supply shock since at least the early 1970s"", the lender added.

""The bank predicts that the increased cost for commodities such as food, oil, gas and metals will have a profound impact on economies, particularly those in lower-income countries,"" it noted.

Ukraine’s modern economy was developed as an integral part of the larger economy of the Soviet Union. While receiving a smaller share (16 percent in the 1980s) of the Soviet Union’s investment funds and producing a greater proportion of goods with a lower set price, Ukraine was able to produce a larger share of total output in the industrial (17 percent) and especially the agricultural (21 percent) sectors of the Soviet economy. In effect, a centrally directed transfer of wealth from Ukraine, amounting to one-fifth of its national income, helped to finance economic development in other parts of the Soviet Union, notably Russia and Kazakhstan.

By the late Soviet period, however, the Ukrainian economy was under severe strain, and it contracted sharply early in the independence era. A period of extreme currency inflation in the early 1990s brought great hardship to most of the population. Despite early hopes that Ukrainian economic independence—with the concomitant end to the transfer of funds and resources to other parts of the Soviet Union—would alleviate the declining economy and standard of living, Ukraine entered a period of severe economic decline. Daily life in Ukraine became a struggle, particularly for those living on fixed incomes, as prices rose sharply. Citizens compensated in a number of ways: more than half grew their own food, workers often held two or three jobs, and many acquired basic necessities through a flourishing barter economy. By 1996 Ukraine had achieved a measure of economic stability. Inflation dropped to manageable levels, and the economy’s decline slowed considerably.

At the turn of the 21st century the economy finally began to grow, at least partially as a result of increased ties with Russia. In the early 21st century many young Ukrainians, particularly residents of the country’s rural west, sought employment opportunities abroad. Although such migration sometimes led to localized labour shortages within Ukraine, remittances from the Ukrainian diaspora amounted to some 4 percent of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP).

The economy contracted sharply in 2014 as a result of the political crisis that toppled the government of pro-Russian Pres. Viktor Yanukovych. Russia responded to Yanukovych’s ouster by illegally annexing Crimea and fomenting an insurgency in southeastern Ukraine. A cease-fire between the Ukrainian government and Russian-backed forces in February 2015 created a state of frozen conflict, and the ongoing violence shattered daily life in what had been Ukraine’s most productive industrial region.",https://www.britannica.com/place/Ukraine/Economy

(Bloomberg) -- Ukraine’s economy will shrink by a fifth this year before bouncing back in 2023, according to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, under a scenario where a cease-fire is brokered in a couple of months.

The forecast is subject to major downside risks “should hostilities escalate or should exports of gas or other commodities from Russia become restricted,” the EBRD said in its biannual Regional Economic Update published on Thursday.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has created the greatest supply shock since at least the early 1970s, the EBRD said, snarling supply chains, upending the energy trade and threatening food exports due to both countries’ key agricultural sectors.

“Currently, the war is happening on territories that produce 60% of Ukrainian GDP,” the EBRD said in the report. About 30% of businesses have stopped production, and electricity consumption is estimated at 60% of pre-war levels, it added.

Russia’s economy is forecast to shrink by 10% this year and stagnate in 2023, according to the EBRD. Russia’s recession could be deeper if Europe joins a ban on its oil imports or severely reduces the use of Russian natural gas.
