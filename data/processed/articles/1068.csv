4,39c40a69-a7f0-471d-85df-3976fc0ac1cf,[],,"While Russia continues to apply pressure across the East Donbas front, territorial gains on the ground are not forthcoming.

Kramatorsk Station Missile Strike

A Russian missile strike at Kramatorsk railway station on Friday 8th April, 10:30am local time, appears to have killed many civilians, with the publicly announced death toll standing at 57 dead and 114 wounded.

Published casualty figures for earlier Russian missile strikes are widely believed to be underestimates, such as the attack against Yavoriv ‘Ukraine-NATO Partnership For Peace’ Military Base on 13th March (where international volunteers were receiving rudimentary training).

Kramatorsk is an important node in the infrastructure network connecting embattled Ukrainian forces in East Donbas to the rest of the country.

East Donbas, or, ‘The Leaky Cauldron’

From an early stage in the Russian invasion, Russia state-affiliated media has taken to identifying the East Donbas sector of the conflict as ‘the Cauldron’. Primarily this term emerged as part of the attempt to craft a positive narrative around Russia’s failure to secure large territorial gains in the war.

Reading the combat fronts was the wrong way to view Russia’s strategy, pundits declared. Russia’s aims were actually to destroy the Ukrainian Army, and one of the main areas this would be achieved was East Donbas.

The idea was that East Donbas was an area with a significant concentration of Ukrainian troops, and would be liable to being cut off from resupply. East Donbas is a strategic ‘salient’, or ‘bulge’, where the Russians should theoretically be able to bring more firepower to bear against the defenders and prosecute a successful attack over the long term. Having partially surrounded this ‘cauldron’, the Russians can ‘turn up the heat’.

The failure to properly disconnect the defenders in East Donbas from the rest of Ukraine has meant that if East Donbas is a cauldron, it has so far proved something of a leaky cauldron. Advances southward from Izyum appear to have been decisively stalled, with similar performance along the southern front of this sector. If Russia is to make progress in this war, they will need to achieve a major success in East Donbas over the coming weeks.

Explosions in Donetsk, probably due to Ukrainian shelling, took out an electrical substation on Bakhmetieva street. Russian shelling continues in the vicinity of Maryinka, East Donbas, as Vuhledar, Krasnohorivka, and Avdiivka are hit.

A Russian military convoy was recorded in Novozybkov, north of Ukraine, allegedly recycling to Donbas.

Satellite imagery near Kharkiv from April 8th showed a Russian military convoy moving south through Velykyi Burluk, en route to East Donbas.

A Russian ammunition warehouse near Luhansk was allegedly destroyed by Ukrainian bombardment. Another ammunition warehouse south of Velyka Novosilka was destroyed on Saturday 9th, 18:45 local time, according to drone footage.

On April 9th, 32 Su-35 ‘Flanker’ fighter jets were identified at Voronezh Malshevo airbase, 200km from the Ukrainian border.

A ‘high’ security threat has been declared in the Russian city of Kursk, in anticipation of Ukrainian military or sabotage operations.

Kherson-Mykolaiv Standoff

The combat front between Mykolaiv and Kherson has remained stable for many days, with both sides appearing to trade artillery fire across the 30 mile distance between the two cities.

The situation north of this region appears to be more fluid, with Ukrainian operations aiming to clear villages south of Kryviy Rih, while reports of Russian shelling and bombardment continue.

Mariupol Siege Ongoing

The siege of Mariupol continues. A fair amount of footage continues to emerge from Azov defenders, though there is a possibility that some of this material is from previous skirmishes (and released in small amounts in order to convey an impression of continued successes in the beleaguered city).

Russia has released footage claiming to show the destruction of a Ukrainian armoured vehicle by a Russian-made combat drone.

A recent claim by the Ukrainian Army that ‘around 40’ Russian vehicles were destroyed during a strike on a warehouse near Volnovakha, has been verified, with 35 vehicles destroyed.

It is possible that the vehicles were stored in such a dense concentration in order to hide them from aerial and satellite reconnaissance, decreasing the probability of a fatal airstrike — however, that same concentration resulted in a large toll of vehicles when the hidden unit was discovered and hit.

Missile Strikes and Air Defences

The Russian Ministry of Defence claims to have destroyed S-300 surface to air missile (SAM) systems at Chuhuiv airbase (near Kharkiv) and Starobohdanovka (near Mykolaiv), while also claiming the destruction of a National Guard base at Zvonetske south of Dnipro.

The mayor of Dnipro states that the ‘total destruction’ of Dnipro airport following repeated missile strikes. Fragments of a high-precision Russian missile were recovered near Huliaypole, north of Polohy, east of Zaporizhzhia.

On Friday 8th April, Slovakia transferred its S-300PMU SAM systems to Ukraine, according to local footage.

Kharkiv Bombardment Continues

Dozens of incidents of Russian shelling continue around Kharkiv on a daily basis, ranging from MLRS Grad and Smerch rockets, artillery, and ‘tanks’. According to the head of the regional administration, 66 such incidents took place within a 24 hour period.

Kiev

Footage has emerged showing previous combat operations around Kiev, which were abandoned by the Russians on 30th March.

Following the Russian withdrawal from Kiev and North Ukraine, thousands of foreign journalists have descended upon the capital to gather footage and make reports. One photo shows 6 journalists photographing a cat, while a hundred others swarm a column of burnt-out, rusting Russian vehicles (we do not publish these photos here since the copyrights to such media are owned by AP, AFP, Reuters, and other journalistic footage cartels, whose business activities revolve around reselling this footage in packets to wealthy mainstream news outlets).

1,222 Kiev residents were killed by the Russian Army during the five-week occupation of outlying districts, according to the Ukrainian Attorney General.

According to the World Bank, the economy of Ukraine is set to contract by 45.1% this year, with Russia’s contracting 11.2%. Over 10% of Ukraine’s pre-war population has already left the country as refugees, with the majority in Poland.

Kherson Misinformation

It has been claimed that during a protest against Russian occupation on 10th April (day 46), Russian troops opened fire to disperse protesters. However, the footage appears to be a badly edited version of a clip that emerged on 5th March, and was widely circulated in international media.",https://www.lotuseaters.com/ukraine-conflict-day-44-to-46

Note that this is the first round. If no one hits 50% in the first round (and that has never happened), a second round is scheduled between the two largest vote-getters.



There's a lot of discussion about why Macron's losing ground. One argument is that he's not losing ground: pre-invasion, his popularity stood at right where it is right now. Another argument is that France is angry (when isn't it angry, really?) and Le Pen is tapping into that anger. A third one is that the French rarely like to re-elect their presidents.



Personally, I think Macron's chances of being reelected are in the 50%-60% bracket. Better than even odds, but not much. Given that his opponent is most likely a slightly more polished and smarter version of Trump or Ron Johnson.... *shudder* Note that this is the first round.

The second round is the problem. In the last election, she made into the second round. Then basically everyone who didn't support FN said, ``Oh, God, no. Not her. Anyone but her.'' So she lost to M. Macron by a large margin. This time, if the surveys can be trusted, the vote in the second round may be much closer. In terms of why that is, the BBC's report says most voters consider the economy and large increase in the cost of living to be their main concern. That seems to be what the French voters are most concerned about, and that probably makes a position in favor of more sanctions against Russia less viable (since it probably means driving up energy costs in France.)



As a personal note, the second time I went to France (Nice, specifically) I woke up on the second morning to a FN rally right outside my hotel window. Since they were basically saying, ``we hate all foreigners'', I've never arrived in a foreign country feeling less welcome. Except perhaps for the time when I arrived in Portugal within an hour or so of the returning Portuguese national football team; the US team had just knocked them out of the elimination stage of the World Cup...

6,39c40a69-a7f0-471d-85df-3976fc0ac1cf,[],,"One of the most interesting small arms we’ve seen during the fighting in Ukraine is the Vulcan [Vulkan] or Malyuk bullpup. Available in 7.62x39mm and 5.45x39mm the weapon is built around the action of either an AKM or AK-74. Most frequently seen in the hand’s of Ukrainian special forces the weapon appears to be a well-designed adaptation of the proven AK platform.

Development of the weapon reportedly began in 2005, following efforts by Ukraine’s State Space Agency to adapt an AK-74 into a bullpup. This project began in the early 2000s and was known as the Vepr, not to be confused with the Russian shotgun, and resulted in a fairly basic, non-ambidextrous conversion, notable for its AR-15/M16 style front sight post.

The design and development of the Vulcan was undertaken by a company called InterProInvest (IPI). IPI market the weapon under the name Vulcan (Malyuk), as does Ukraine’s state export company SpetsTechnoExport. The weapon’s nickname ‘Malyuk’ translates into English as ‘baby’. Unlike conventional rifles bullpups place the breech and magazine behind the trigger and pistol grip. This has the advantage of creating a more compact package while maintaining a full-length barrel.

The weapons are manufactured at the ‘Krasyliv Aggregate Plant’ in Khmelnytskyi Oblast, western Ukraine. The Krasyliv Plant is part of Ukroboronprom, Ukraine’s state-owned defence industry enterprise. The plant produced a number of civilian and military products and also produces parts for the Stugna-P ATGM.

In an interview with Ukrainian Defence Review in 2015, IPI’s Vice CEO, Serhiy Luhovskoy, said that the prototype development of the weapon was “done under a contract that we got from Ukraine’s Security Service [SBU].” Following positive feedback from the SBU elements of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence became interested in around 2008.

The Malyuk was unveiled publicly in 2015 and was first evaluated by the Ukrainian Army in 2016. Ukroboronprom announced in late 2016 that the rifle had been accepted by the Ukrainian armed forces, stating it had successfully passed testing. It appears that a relatively small but significant number have been procured by Ukraine’s special forces.

The basic design of the weapon changed very little between 2015 and 2019, but refinements appear to have been made. The most significant external refinement is the removal of the AR-15/M16 type front sight (similar to that seen on the earlier Vepr) and fixed rear sight assembly in favour of a full length top rail and folding back up iron sights. With this change the latch for the upper assembly appears to have been moved from the side to over the top of the barrel.

As the weapon went into production continued improvements were made, in 2017 the weapon still used an AK-style selector lever but by 2019 this had been replaced by smaller selectors on either side of the receiver. The latest version of the Vulcan has a number of new features including an adjustable gas block which may suggest that the barrel and block are now of new manufacture (rather than repurposed from old AKs). There is also a new five position adjustable stock.

The 7.62x39mm and 5.45x39mm rifles appear to be made using a mixture of new and old parts. This has been confirmed by images of examples seen in the field. We know that the rifles are made using the barrels, trunnions, bolts and sections of the original AK-pattern rifle’s receiver. The receiver is cut down, the front sight assembly and rear sight block are removed and a new gas piston is installed in the bolt carrier. The recoil spring appears to be held captive in the upper receiver. When the upper is detached the spring and guide rod hang from the rear of the upper.

A 5.45x39mm chambered Vulcan (IPI)

The weapon can be fired from the left or right shoulder and has ambidextrous controls with selector levers on both sides at the rear of the receiver. The charging handle is non-reciprocating and can be swapped from left to right. The chassis has a large polymer brass deflector which protects the shooter when the weapon is being fired from the left shoulder. The magazine release is located directly behind the weapon’s trigger and can be operated when firing from either shoulder. The 7.62 and 5.45 rifles feed from standard pattern AK magazines. In addition to the magazine release behind the trigger there is a thumb release within the magazine housing at the rear of the magazine – the 5.56 version does not appear to have this feature. The 5.56 rifle appears to use an AK pattern magazine rather than a STANAG one. The housing is designed to allow the magazines to drop free under their own weight. The rifle has a push button safety located above the trigger which can be reached by the trigger finger.

The non-reciprocating charging handle is attached to a collar which sits around the gas piston system and acts on the bolt assembly without being attached to the piston or bolt itself. This allows it to be positioned ahead the trigger and pistol grip. An action bar projects back from the trigger, into the rifle’s receiver, to trip the sear.

The rifle consists of three major assemblies: the upper which is a polymer assembly which retains the weapon’s mainspring and provides a platform for optics mounting. The barrel and receiver assembly which consists of the barrel, firing mechanism and magazine well. And the lower, which is a polymer pistol grip and forend which slides onto the receiver assembly. The upper and lower are held in place by a locking lever and cross pin.

The Malyuk has a convection system within the stock chassis which IPI says allows air to flow through the hollow pistol grip and out above the barrel. IPI says this allows the enclosed barrel to cool and is claimed to extend barrel life.

IPI state the weapon’s empty weight as 3.8kg (8.38lb), its overall length is 712mm or 28 inches and its barrel length is 415mm (or 16in). The rifle has a rate of fire of 660RPM in fully automatic and feeds from standard AK and AK-74 pattern magazines (or STANAG if a variant chambered in 5.56x45mm).

Commercial, semi-automatic Malyuk K-01 (IPI)

Along side a pair of semi-automatic variants of the rifle, the Malyuk K-01 in 7.62x39mm and the K-02 in 5.56x45mm in 2019, IPI introduced the ‘Shepit’ or Whisper, designed for operations that require quiet, precision work. It has a longer 520mm or 20.4 inch barrel, a longer forend for mounting a bipod on and a longer, alternate suppressor design. It also has an adjustable length of pull with a butt piece which is able to extend up to 3 inches. The Whisper is chambered in either 7.62x39mm or 5.56x45mm. IPI’s website does not have a great deal of information on the weapon but lists its weight as 4kg with an overall length of 850mm.

Perhaps the most interesting member of the Vulcan family is the RIFF-P, an electronic anti-drone system which uses the Vulan’s bullpup chassis. IPI states that the RIFF-P has a range of up to 1.5km and weighs around 5kg.

Combat use of the Malyuk appears to have been widespread with not only members of Special Operations Forces units seen armed with them but also troops from Ukraine’s National Guard and even the Territorial Defence Force battalions. Ukrainian SSO (or Special Operations Forces) units which have been seen using the rifles include elements from the 73rd Maritime Special Operations Center, 3rd and 8th Special Purpose Regiments as well as the National Police’s Rapid Operational Response Unit (KORD). Elements of the Ukrainian National Guard including the 2nd Special Purpose Battalion and the Azov Special Operations Detachment in Mariupol have also been seen equipped with the rifles.

The Malyuk is often seen with a sizeable IPI-made suppressor. The barrel is threaded and can also accept an AK-74-style muzzle brake. Photos from in theatre show that the top Picatinny top rail is made from metal and is not a polymer moulded part. In terms of accessories along with the top rail there is also a section of rail at 6 o’clock on the polymer forend which allows the mounting of a front grip and smaller rail sections at 3 and 9 o’clock for the mounting of accessories like lights and lasers. The rifles are frequently seen in the field with Aimpoint CompM4s, red dot and magnifier combinations and occasionally variable power optics.
