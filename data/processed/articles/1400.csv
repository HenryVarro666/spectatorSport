Kramer', 'Azi Paybarah', 'Catherine Porter', 'Mauricio Lima']",2022-03-05 00:00:00,"Footage verified by The New York Times and interviews with residents point to the growing humanitarian crisis in a key port city in southern Ukraine.

Staggered by blasts pummeling the city, cut off from heat through freezing nights, and running low on food and water, the people of Mariupol, Ukraine, have been trapped by Russia’s siege.

In interviews, residents and local officials in Mariupol, a port on the Sea of Azov, described nightmarish conditions after five days of shelling by Russian forces around the city. On Sunday, city officials said they would attempt to resume an evacuation effort that was called off a day earlier because of Russian attacks.

“There’s no electricity, no heating, no telephone connection. It is absolute horror,” said Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the mayor of Mariupol. “People drink from puddles in the streets.”

The shelling has destroyed the city’s left bank district, he said, making it “unfit for human life.” The city had not been able to accurately count the dead or even help many of the wounded because of the barrage, he added.

“It just never stops,” he said. “Everyone who tries to go outside risks their life. That is why the mayor can’t ask people to do that, it would be like sending people to a certain death.”

Videos have shown explosions rocking Mariupol’s residential areas and starting fires, as well as the ruins of shops and cars around city.

“The shelling is constant and at random,” said a resident, Diana Berg. “When you’re on the street, at any moment, a rocket can land next to you.” She said that people were still braving the streets to make fires for warmth.

On Saturday, city leaders halted a planned evacuation because of the shelling, and accused Russian forces of violating a temporary cease-fire that was meant to allow some of the city’s nearly half-million residents to flee. President Vladimir V. Putin blamed Ukraine for sabotaging the humanitarian routes.

Mikhail Vershinin, the head of the Donetsk Regional Patrol Police, said that several hundred cars had planned to form convoys to leave the city through the humanitarian corridor.

“As soon as we sent the cars back home, the offensive attacks in that region began,” he said. The city, he said, was facing “a humanitarian catastrophe.”

Mr. Andryushchenko, the mayor’s adviser, said that city officials were wary of the Russian forces even as they gathered people for the planned evacuation, and could not send residents out because the route was too dangerous. “There was no cease-fire for the whole length of the corridor and Russian troops continued to attack our positions,” he said. “That is why we did not let the people board the buses.”

The city’s leaders had not given up, Mr. Andryushchenko said, and were trying to negotiate another evacuation attempt through the blockade. “It is literally our last hope,” he said.",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/03/05/world/russia-ukraine

>lack of manpower/equipment?

>logistics in getting troops where they can be formed into competent formations?

Mainly that they are launching a three-front war and they would have to sacrifice their reserves in Western Ukraine to avoid a loss (and their Western forces appear to be sitting on their asses deliberately either because of orders or because they are playing dumb).Yes. The ""shock and awe"" aspect of Russia's initial punitive invasion either knocked out a large portion of Ukraine's military airports or made them unable to access at full scale with full forces. Because of this they lack air power and are only barely managing to prevent Russian air superiority right now. think Chinese airforce vs Taiwanese airforce except spread out over a country the size and geography of Texas. Without air superiority they are having to rely on digging in and holding cities, which was working up until the Russians began to bring in heavy equipment yesterday and changed their no-civilian-casualties policy to ""burn it all"" policy for anywhere Ukrainian forces try to bunker down. Until yesterday the war was being fought by Russian conscripts using outdated late-soviet-era equipment which wore down the Ukrainian forces using brand new Western equipment. Now the Russians are sending in their more modern equipment and the results can be seen from the war maps two days ago in the heavily contested regions (Sumy, Kharkiv, Mariupol, Kherson) vs today and likely tomorrow's maps. The Ukrainians were had thinking they were dealing with the main Russian assault and thus going all-out on defense (admittedly taking out more Russians than I expected) when they were just dealing with the pre-assault forces. The real fun will begin probably this weekend.They are already formed into competent formations as mentioned in >>25993 the issue is that Ukraine is a corrupt shithole that didn't invest properly into military infrastructure over the last almost-decade and the troops can't really move from the locations they are at since they are getting pressed on all sides with Ukrainian military leadership seeming to be of the belief that death is better than routing your army to fight another day. Zelensky is pushing a war to the last drop of blood rather than bunkering down on the Western side of the river, so he's (unwisely) forcing his troops out East to die a dog's death to save his skin out West, and those Eastern troops are his veteran elite. The only comparable group are the specialist mountain brigades but if you take them out of the mountains you're royally fucked.",https://anon.cafe/k/res/25279.html
