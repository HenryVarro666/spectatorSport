The Ukrainian authorities announced that the Russian forces began to withdraw from the Sumy region, in the east of the country.

Yesterday, the Ukrainian Independent Information Agency quoted Dmytro Zyvitsky, head of the Sumy regional administration, as saying that despite this, it is too early to say that the region has been liberated.

He said that a large number of Russian forces had been spotted in the area during the past week, and there had been many attacks.

He added that Russian military vehicles that had entered the city through a corridor from Kyiv and Chernihiv returned towards Russia, indicating that many destroyed Russian tanks and military equipment could be seen.",https://globeecho.com/news/ukraine-russian-forces-began-withdrawing-from-sumy/

Russian troops began to “actively” withdraw from the city hours ago, Dmytro Zhyvytskyi said on Telegram.

The city has borne the brunt of Russian shelling since the start of the Ukraine invasion on Feb. 24.

“Last week, we saw a large accumulation of Russian troops from Bilopillia to Konotop, around Konotop…New columns came in, they dug in and terrorized the region,” Zhyvytskyi said, state-run news agency Ukrinform reported.

The official attributed the sudden accumulation of military equipment to Russians trying to cover the withdrawal of their forces from nearby areas.

He added that the columns were no longer there.

“We have seen a lot of equipment coming towards Russia, with our artillery chasing them. The armed forces of Ukraine and the territorial defense have driven them out through the entire Chernihiv region,” Zhyvytskyi said.

However, he added that some Russian forces still remained in the Sumy region.

The Ukrainian army claimed that Russia has lost some 18,000 soldiers, 644 tanks, 143 planes, 134 helicopters and many other weapons and equipment between Feb. 24 to Apr. 3. EFE int-rml/pd/ssk",https://www.laprensalatina.com/urakine-says-russian-troops-are-withdrawing-from-sumy/

""Further information is being clarified.""

A fuel depot was hit in Odesa early Sunday by Russian forces. Bratchuk said there were no casualties in that incident.

Some context: Odesa has been a place of relative calm during the Russian invasion and a haven for displaced Ukrainians from areas that have seen the worst fighting.

In a video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for an end to Russian “war crimes.”

His address came after reports of dozens of bodies found in the streets and mass graves in the Ukrainian city of Bucha.

“The world has already seen many war crimes. At different times. On different continents. But it is time to do everything possible to make the war crimes of the Russian military the last manifestation of such evil on earth,” Zelensky said.

Zelensky called on Russian leaders to be held accountable for the actions of the nation's military.

“I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being fulfilled. Such orders. Such a fulfillment. And joint responsibility. For these murders, for these tortures, for these arms torn off by explosions that lie on the streets. For shots in the back of the head of tied people. This is how the Russian state will now be perceived. This is your image,” Zelensky said.

In his address, Zelensky announced a “mechanism of justice” would be established to investigate crimes committed by Russian soldiers in Ukrainian territory. The mechanism would be supported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Office of the Prosecutor General, the National Police, the Security Service, the Intelligence Service and other government branches, he said.

“This mechanism will help Ukraine and the world bring to concrete justice those who unleashed or in any way participated in this terrible war against the Ukrainian people and in crimes against our people,” he said.

Zelensky said he will provide more information on the state of Ukrainian territory that was occupied by Russian forces.

“All partners of Ukraine will be informed in detail about what happened in the temporarily occupied territory of our state. War crimes in Bucha and other cities during the Russian occupation will also be considered by the UN Security Council on Tuesday,” he said.

He also noted efforts are underway to restore electricity and water to Bucha, as well as reestablishing medical institutions and infrastructure.

Zelensky once again invoked the need for stronger sanctions against Russia.

“There will definitely be a new package of sanctions against Russia. But I'm sure that's not enough. More conclusions are needed. Not only about Russia, but also about the political behavior that actually allowed this evil to come to our land,” he said.",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-04-04-22/h_14cefcb130fc0e172a7a501d15d2f582
