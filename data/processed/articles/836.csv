The 30-year old, who is doing apprenticeship in gastroenterology at a Kyiv hospital, had planned to return to India in March. But with Russia launching military operations on Thursday, flights have been suspended and he is unsure of what is in store. ""Did not expect this intensification. It is a full-scale military invasion. Never imagined this,"" the 2017 national rapid chess champion told PTI from Kyiv. At a media briefing on Thursday, India's Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla assured all Indian citizens in Ukraine that the government will take all steps to bring them back safely. He said there were around 20,000 Indians in Ukraine and of them, nearly 4,000 have returned to India in the last few days. Upadhyaya said he has seen turmoil in the country, recalling the student protests in 2013 against the then President Viktor Yanukovych's decision of not signing an agreement that would have brought Ukraine closer to the European Union. But he acknowledged that nothing compared to the chaos that has unfolded in the last few days. ""I was present during the Maidan Revolution which was bad but not this scary,"" Upadhyaya said, describing the current situation.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday told the leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) that the UK will ""imminently"" impose direct sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

Addressing a virtual meeting of NATO leaders, Johnson said his government will personally sanction the Russian leaders over their ""revanchist mission"" to overturn the post-Cold War order. He also called for ""immediate action"" to ban Russia from the SWIFT payment platform to ""inflict maximum pain"" on the Russian regime.

""The Prime Minister urged leaders to take immediate action against SWIFT to inflict maximum pain on President Putin and his regime. The UK would introduce sanctions against President Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov imminently, on top of the sanctions package the UK announced yesterday,"" he said, a Downing Street spokesperson said, with reference to the NATO meeting.

""The Prime Minister added that the world must make certain President Putin would fail in this act of aggression. Ukraine was showing strong resistance. He added that there could no normalisation of relations with Russia after this act,"" the spokesperson said.",https://www.newindianexpress.com/live/2022/feb/25/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-india-abstains-from-voting-at-unsc-on-ukraine-crisis-russia-vetoes-2423362.html

Russian forces have seized control of Chernobyl nuclear power plant after a 'fierce' battle, with the condition of nuclear storage facilities 'unknown', sparking fears of a radiation leak that could cause fallout in Europe.

Video revealed Russian tanks and armoured vehicles standing in front of the destroyed reactor, which sits just 60 miles north of the capital Kiev.

An official said Russian shelling hit a radioactive waste repository and an increase in radiation levels was reported, although this has not yet been corroborated.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said it is following the situation in Ukraine 'with grave concern' and appealed for maximum restraint to avoid any action that may put Ukraine's nuclear facilities at risk.

Ukrainian presidential advisor Myhailo Podolyak said: 'After the absolutely senseless attack of the Russians in this direction, it is impossible to say that the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is safe.'

Meanwhile Turkey reported that one of its ships had been hit by a 'bomb' off the coast of Odessa, where fighting is also going on. Turkey is a member of NATO, underlining fears that the war in Ukraine could quickly suck in other states and spark an all-out conflict in Europe.

Speaking after the latest developments, Joe Biden announced more sanctions against Russia but admitted that he had not expected previous threats of financial penalties to deter Vladimir Putin.

He also resisted calls to send in US troops to Ukraine, saying he has no plans to speak to the Russian leader who he accuses of trying to rebuild a Soviet empire.

The sanctions will target Russian banks, oligarchs, state-controlled companies and high-tech sectors, but Russian oil and natural gas were exempt in a bid to avoid disruption to global markets.

'Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences,' Biden said in remarks at the White House.

Elsewhere, Kiev ordered civilians into bomb shelters and declared a curfew amid concerns Russia is about to strike the capital as Ukrainian troops lost control of a key airfield around 15 miles away. Russian forces had attacked it with around two dozen attack helicopters earlier in the day, four of which are thought to have been shot down.

'They are going to bomb Kyiv now. Authorities told us to hide in shelters,' a source in the city told MailOnline as authorities said a hospital had been hit, killing four people.

The Ukrainian army was this afternoon fighting in almost every region of the country, battling the Russians for control of military bases, airports, cities and ports from Kharkiv to Kiev, and Donetsk to Odessa.

It came after Vladimir Putin personally gave the order to attack around 5am, unleashing a salvo of rocket fire that American intelligence said involved more than 100 short and medium-range ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and surface-to-air missiles, and 75 bombers that targeted military sites including barracks, warehouses and airfields in order to knock out the country's military command structure.

Russia said the strikes destroyed 74 Ukrainian military ground facilities, 11 airfields, three command posts and 18 radar stations controlling Kiev's anti-aircraft batteries.

That was followed by attacks from Crimea in the south towards the city of Kherson, a northern advance from Belarus to Kiev, and an eastern advance from Belgorod towards Kharkiv where the heaviest fighting is going on.

American officials said this was merely an 'initial phase' of the attack, and that the majority of Russia's 190,000 troops at the front remain in reserve. The goal of the attack is to 'take key population centres' and 'decapitate the Ukrainian government', the officials added.

Ukraine's health ministry said so far 57 people have been killed on the first day of conflict, while 169 have been wounded.

The port cities of Mariupol and Odessa, where Ukraine's main naval bases are located, were also attacked - though Odessa appeared to remain under Ukrainian control as of Thursday afternoon. Russian tankers blockaded the Kerch Strait, leading from the Back Sea to the Sea of Azov, cutting off Mariupol.

Ukraine has hit back, shooting down five Russian helicopters, destroying dozens of tanks and capturing Russian troops.

A Russian AN-26 military transport aircraft also crashed in the southern Voronezh region, killing its crew on board.

The accident could have been caused by a technical failure and has not inflicted any damage on the ground, Interfax said, citing a press office of Russia's western military district.

Volodymyr Zelensky, in an address to the nation on Thursday evening, described Russia as 'evil' and said Putin had attacked 'like a suicidal scoundrel... just as Fascist Germany did in World War II'.

'Ukraine will not surrender its freedom, whatever Moscow thinks,' he added. 'For Ukrainians independence and the right to live free on our land is the highest value.'

He had earlier called on all Ukrainian citizens willing to defend their homeland to step forward, saying guns will be issued to everyone who wants one. He also asked for civilians to give blood to help wounded troops. And he asked world leaders to impose the 'harshest sanctions possible' on Putin.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, addressing the nation at midday, said western allies are preparing a 'massive' package of sanctions against Russia and told the people of Ukraine: 'We cannot and will not just look away.' Johnson referred to Putin as a 'dictator' who would never 'subdue the national feeling of the Ukrainians'.

As the West prepared to cut off Russia financially, Vladimir Putin summoned his oligarchs to demand loyalty over his attack on Ukraine - perhaps fearing a rebellion from within after prominent Russian TV figures and celebrities spoke out to oppose the conflict.

Speaking in the Kremlin, he said that Russia had been 'forced' to take action over Ukraine and had 'no other choice' but to attack, saying the country remains 'part of the global economy' and that he 'will not hurt the system we belong to'. 'I want you to show solidarity with the government,' he told them.

World leaders react to Russia's war on Ukraine RUSSIA PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN 'I have decided to conduct a special military operation... to protect people who have been subjected to bullying and genocide... for the last eight years. 'And for this we will strive for the demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine. And to bring to court those who committed numerous bloody crimes against civilians, including against citizens of the Russian Federation.' UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELINSKIY 'Russia treacherously attacked our state in the morning, as Nazi Germany did in the WW2 years. 'As of today, our countries are on different sides of world history. Russia has embarked on a path of evil, but Ukraine is defending itself & won't give up its freedom no matter what Moscow thinks.' NATO SECRETARY-GENERAL JENS STOLTENBERG 'This is a deliberate, cold-blooded and long-planned invasion... 'Peace on our continent has been shattered Russia is using force to try to rewrite history, and deny Ukraine its free and independent path... 'We have no plans to send NATO troops in Ukraine. What we do is defensive.' U.S PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN 'President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering... 'I will be meeting with the leaders of the G7, and the United States and our allies and partners will be imposing severe sanctions on Russia.' EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT URSULA VON DER LEYEN 'President Putin is responsible for bringing war back to Europe... 'We will target strategic sectors of the Russian economy by blocking their access to key technologies and markets. We will weaken Russia's economic base and its capacity to modernise.' 'In addition, we will freeze Russian assets in the EU and stop the access of Russian banks to the European financial market.' EUROPEAN COMMISSION FOREIGN POLICY CHIEF JOSEP BORRELL 'These are among the darkest hours of Europe since the Second World War. 'The EU will respond in the strongest possible terms and agree on the harshest package of sanctions we have ever implemented.' GERMAN CHANCELLOR OLAF SCHOLZ 'Putin is bringing suffering and destruction to his direct neighbours, he is violating the sovereignty and borders of Ukraine. 'He is endangering the lives of countless innocent people (and)... the peace order on our continent. For all that there is no justification. This is Putin's war.' FRENCH PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON 'France strongly condemns the decision of Russia to start a war with Ukraine. Russia must immediately put an end to its military operations.' BRITISH PRIME MINISTER BORIS JOHNSON 'President Putin has chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction by launching this unprovoked attack on Ukraine... 'This is a catastrophe for our continent.' CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON HUA CHUNYING 'You are using a typical Western media question method of using the word invasion. 'China is closely monitoring the latest situation.

The options we can offer the government in support of the (NATO)alliance are extremely limited... 'We have all seen it coming but were not able to get through with our arguments to draw the consequences after (Russia's) annexation of Crimea. This does not feel good. I am fed up with it.' TURKISH FOREIGN MINISTRY 'This attack is a grave violation of international law and poses a serious threat to the security of our region and the world. 'We call on the Russian Federation to immediately end this unjust and unlawful act.' HUNGARIAN PRIME MINISTER VIKTOR ORBAN 'With our EU and NATO allies, we condemn Russia's military attack.'

It came after the Russian strongman gave an extraordinary address to the Russian nation - broadcast in the early hours during a UN meeting aimed at avoiding war - in which he declared a 'special military operation' to 'de-militarise' and 'de-Nazify' Ukraine in what amounted to a outright declaration of war. The video appeared to have been pre-recorded, around the same time as Putin's Monday address recognising Donbass as independent.

Putin also issued a chilling warning to any country thinking of coming to Ukraine's aid, vowing 'consequences greater than any you have faced in history'. 'I hope I have been heard,' he said.

The mood on the ground in Ukraine was mixed. Some showed incredible resolve - heading to work via train and road even as the bombs dropped. Elderly women in the city of Kharkiv, under heavy attack, gathered in the street to pray. But for others, the sight of Russian attack was too much. Highways out of Kiev clogged with cars as people fled, while refugees began crossing the borders into Poland and Slovakia.

One Ukrainian woman voiced the outrage of her nation today as she confronted heavily armed Russian soldiers and demanded to know what they were doing in her country.

The woman, wearing a headscarf, shouted at two of the invaders: 'What the f*** are you doing in our land?' while one of the embarrassed soldiers in Henichesk, a port city on the sea of Azov, tried to calm her.

She walked away, then called back: 'You should put sunflower seeds in your pockets so that they will grow on Ukranian land after you die.'

Speaking in an emergency White House press conference, Biden today called Putin a 'pariah' on the international stage and called on the West to stand up to the 'bully'.

But he insisted the US would not be helping Ukraine with troops.

He said: 'Our forces are not, and will not be, engaged in the conflict with Russia in Ukraine. Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our Nato allies and reassure those allies in the east.

'When the history of this era is written, Putin's choice to make a totally unjustifiable war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.

'He has much larger ambitions than Ukraine. He wants to, in fact, re-establish the former Soviet Union. That's what this is about.'

Meanwhile protesters in Moscow voiced their support for Ukraine as they chanted 'There is no war' outside Pushkinskaya Metro station in the Russian capital.

The invasion - a naked attempt to redraw the map of Europe by force - marks the most concerted attempt to up-end world order since the end of the Cold War, and risks sparking the bloodiest conflict in Europe since the end of the Second World War.

Underlining the gravity of the moment, Ukrainian Interior Ministry advisor Anton Herashchenko said: 'Starting today, the world has a new geopolitical reality. Either Ukraine and the world will stop the new Hitler now, or there will be a Third World War.'

Western leaders lined up to condemn Russia's actions in the early hours, with security councils convened the world over to mount a response. Heavy sanctions are expected to follow, along with more shipments of military equipment to Ukraine - provided they can find a route in.

But NATO and the US have made it clear that no troops will be sent, leaving Ukraine's military - far the inferior of Russia - to hold off the assault alone. Few expect it to emerge victorious from what is almost certain to be a prolonged, bloody, and vicious war.

NATO is expected to focus its efforts on stopping the war from spilling over into neighbouring countries. Poland, a member of the alliance, shares an extensive land border with Ukraine. The Baltic states - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, also NATO members - will now fear a Russian assault.

The alliance began moving its forces early Thursday, putting 100 warplanes on high alert in Europe whole moving more troops to the Baltics.

Moldova, where some Russian ground troops are already based, is also at risk of falling to Putin. From there, he could strike out at Romania - another former Soviet state.

Unconfirmed reports said that Russian forces had destroyed or rendered unusable the Ukrainian navy, and struck Boryspil Airport in Kiev. Access to the Black Sea and Azov Sea was cut off.

President Joe Biden will address the nation at noon on Thursday, and on Wednesday night he condemned Russia's 'unprovoked and unjustified attack.' He was speaking to Ukraine's president.

Biden said in a statement: 'President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering.

'Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable.'

Biden said he will be monitoring the situation from Washington, DC, and will continue to get regular updates from his national security team.

Putin justified it all in a televised address, asserting that the attack was needed to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine - a false claim the U.S. had predicted he would make as a pretext for an invasion.

He accused the U.S. and its allies of ignoring Russia's demands to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and for security guarantees. He also claimed that Russia does not intend to occupy Ukraine but will move to 'demilitarize' it and bring those who committed crimes to justice.

Biden in a written statement condemned the 'unprovoked and unjustified attack,' and he promised that the U.S. and its allies would 'hold Russia accountable.' The president said he planned to speak to Americans on Thursday after a meeting of the Group of Seven leaders. More sanctions against Russia were expected to be announced Thursday.

Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba described the assault as a 'full-scale invasion' and said Ukraine will 'defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now.'

In the capital, Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko advised residents to stay home unless they are involved in critical work and urged them to prepare go-bags with necessities and documents if they need to evacuate. An Associated Press photographer in Mariupol reported hearing explosions and seeing dozens of people with suitcases heading for their cars to leave the city.

'We are facing a war and horror. What could be worse?' 64-year-old Liudmila Gireyeva said in Kyiv. She planned to head to the western city of Lviv and then to try to move to Poland to join her daughter. Putin 'will be damned by history, and Ukrainians are damning him.'

The Russian claims about knocking out Ukrainian air defenses and Ukrainian claims to have shot down several Russian aircraft could not immediately be verified. The Ukrainian air defense system and air force date back to the Soviet era and are dwarfed by Russia's massive air power and its inventory of precision weapons.

The Russian Defense Ministry said it was not targeting cities, but using precision weapons and claimed that 'there is no threat to civilian population.'

Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister, said on Facebook that the Russian military had launched missile strikes on Ukrainian military command facilities, air bases and military depots in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Dnipro.

Biden announced he will join G7 counterparts on Thursday morning, and will address the country later on Thursday to 'announce the further consequences the United States and its Allies and partners will impose on Russia.'

'We will also coordinate with our NATO Allies to ensure a strong, united response that deters any aggression against the Alliance. Tonight, Jill and I are praying for the brave and proud people of Ukraine,' the statement added.

Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, tweeted early on Thursday: 'I am appalled by the horrific events in Ukraine and I have spoken to President Zelenskyy to discuss next steps. President Putin has chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction by launching this unprovoked attack on Ukraine. The UK and our allies will respond decisively.'

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has also signed restrictions prohibiting all scheduled Russian airlines from entering UK airspace or touching down on British soil.

Putin in his speech on Thursday told other countries not to get involved.

'To anyone who would consider interfering from the outside - if you do, you will face consequences greater than any you have faced in history,' he said in the television broadcast around 6am Moscow time.

The consequences of the conflict and resulting sanctions on Russia could reverberate throughout the world, upending geopolitical dynamics in Europe as well as affecting energy supplies in Europe and jolting global financial markets.

'An explosion made the ground beneath our feet tremble': NICK CRAVEN reports from Kiev Ukrainians woke to the sound of missiles and air strikes as their worst fears were realised, with explosions in Kiev causing the ground to tremble and windows shake. All across the country people ran to basement bomb shelters as Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade. Shortly after 5am the crumps of explosions shook the windows of my hotel room as myself and MailOnline photographer Simon Ashton donned the body armour and helmets that have weighed us down, unused in their bag for the last month. For an hour the night sky lit up in the distance to the north and east of the city as military targets were pounded by bombs, and we run to the basement for safety. Braver - or perhaps more foolish - souls headed in the other direction to the 11th floor roof bar in the Intercontinental Hotel where many international media have based themselves. At 6.36am there was by far the loudest explosion from our perspective, believed to be an air strike on a military airfield near Kyiv, which made the ground beneath our feet tremble. By dawn there was an eerie calm as an overcast drizzly day began, broken only by the cheerful chimes of the bells of St Michael's golden domed Monastery across the square from the hotel at 7am. At 7.05am the first air raid sirens rang out all across the city, though no blitz followed in the central area at least. Surreally, even as the dreaded noise of the sirens rent the air, a steady stream of headlights could be seen driving into the city as commuters came in to start the day. But the calm wasn't to last long as the full extent of the Russian invasion began to reveal itself, with troops attacking the border on three sides and air strikes right across the country, even as far west as Lviv, near the Polish border. By 8am local time, queues of people were seen at bank ATMs in the city, perhaps the first sign of panic, following the introduction of a state of emergency across the country from midnight last night. Police and soldiers stood on many of the street corners to keep order. Long lines also formed at gas stations around the city, but with so many places being pounded from the air, it wasn't obvious where would be the safest place to flee to. Having said that, although the streets were noticeably quieter than usual as the working day began, people were mostly calmly going about their business, perhaps still coming to terms with what might be next. When I first arrived in this country a month ago, few Ukrainians took Putin's sabre-rattling seriously. Most admitted that it was possible he might move into the Donbas to annexe the pro-Russian breakaway republics of Luhansk and Donetsk, but very few believed Russia would mount a full-scale invasion of their neighbour.

Asian stock markets plunged and oil prices surged as the attack began. Earlier, Wall Street's benchmark S&P 500 index fell 1.8% to an eight-month low after the Kremlin said rebels in eastern Ukraine asked for military assistance.

Anticipating international condemnation and countermeasures, Putin issued a stark warning to other countries not to meddle, saying, 'whoever tries to impede us, let alone create threats for our country and its people, must know that the Russian response will be immediate and lead to the consequences you have never seen in history.'

Putin urged Ukrainian servicemen to 'immediately put down arms and go home.'

In a stark reminder of Russia's nuclear power, Putin warned that 'no one should have any doubts that a direct attack on our country will lead to the destruction and horrible consequences for any potential aggressor.' He emphasized that Russia is 'one of the most potent nuclear powers and also has a certain edge in a range of state-of-the-art weapons.'

Though the U.S. on Tuesday announced the repositioning of forces around the Baltics, Biden has said he will not send in troops to fight Russia.

Putin announced the military operation after the Kremlin said rebels in eastern Ukraine asked Russia for military assistance to help fend off Ukrainian 'aggression,' an announcement that the White House said was a 'false flag' operation by Moscow to offer up a pretext for an invasion.

Putin's announcement came just hours after the Ukrainian president rejected Moscow's claims that his country poses a threat to Russia and made a passionate, last-minute plea for peace.

'The people of Ukraine and the government of Ukraine want peace,' Zelenskyy said in an emotional overnight address, speaking in Russian in a direct appeal to Russian citizens. 'But if we come under attack, if we face an attempt to take away our country, our freedom, our lives and lives of our children, we will defend ourselves. When you attack us, you will see our faces, not our backs.'

Zelenskyy said he asked to arrange a call with Putin late Wednesday, but the Kremlin did not respond.

In an apparent reference to Putin's move to authorize the deployment of the Russian military to 'maintain peace' in eastern Ukraine, Zelensky warned that 'this step could mark the start of a big war on the European continent.'

'Any provocation, any spark could trigger a blaze that will destroy everything,' he said.

He challenged the Russian propaganda claims, saying that 'you are told that this blaze will bring freedom to the people of Ukraine, but the Ukrainian people are free.'

At an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council called by Ukraine because of the imminent threat of a Russian invasion, members still unaware of Putin's announcement appealed to him to stop an attack. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres opened the meeting, just before the announcement, telling Putin: 'Stop your troops from attacking Ukraine. Give peace a chance. Too many people have already died.'

NATO Secretary-General Jen Stoltenberg issued a statement condemning 'Russia's reckless and unprovoked attack on Ukraine, which puts at risk countless civilian lives. Once again, despite our repeated warnings and tireless efforts to engage in diplomacy, Russia has chosen the path of aggression against a sovereign and independent country.'

European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen promised to hold the Kremlin accountable.

CNN's correspondent reporting live as Kiev attacked

CNN's correspondent in Kiev was live on air on Thursday morning as Russia's attack was launched. 'I just heard a big bang right here behind me. I've never heard anything like it,' said Matthew Chance, CNN's senior international correspondent. Chance quickly put on his flak jacket and helmet while he continued to report from a balcony in the Ukrainian capital. 'There are big explosions taking place. I can't see them or explain what they are,' he said. 'But I will tell you the U.S has warned the Ukrainian authorities there could be air strikes and ground attacks as well around the country, including the capital. 'I don't know if that's what's occurring now but it's a remarkable coincidence that the explosions come just minutes after Putin gave his speech,' Chance explained. 'This is the first time we've heard anything. It has been absolutely silent. This is the first time. It has to be more than just a coincidence. 'I think it's safe where I am. I have a flak jacket,' Chance remarked before ducking down to put on his protective gear. Advertisement

'In these dark hours, our thoughts are with Ukraine and the innocent women, men and children as they face this unprovoked attack and fear for their lives,' they said on Twitter.

Even before Putin's announcement, dozens of nations imposed sanctions on Russia, further squeezing Russian oligarchs and banks out of international markets.

The Russian Foreign Ministry has shrugged off the sanctions, saying that 'Russia has proven that, with all the costs of the sanctions, it is able to minimize the damage.'

The threat of war has already shredded Ukraine's economy and raised the specter of massive casualties, energy shortages across Europe and global economic chaos.

Across Ukraine, cruise and ballistic missiles were destroying military infrastructure and strategically important facilities, according to unofficial Russian sources.

Mariupol, on the Black Sea 50 miles from the Russian border, appeared to be under fierce attack. Taking this strategic location would give the Donbas republics access to the sea.

The moment Ukraine and the rest of Europe had dreaded for months finally came shortly after 4.35am local time when huge explosions were heard in Kiev and other cities across the country.

Terrified citizens rushed to bomb shelters, though no air raid warnings sounded in the capital – only the frequent muffled crump of missile or air strikes breaking through the pre-dawn stillness.

In Kiev, people were sheltering in basements as the sounds of distant explosions became a constant backdrop.

Within an hour Russians special force and airborne troops were reported to be on the ground at Kiev's Boryspil Airport, amid fierce fighting.

A woman in the Ukrainian capital said: 'I was woken by a friend.

'I am in the centre of Kiev.

'I hear the sound of distant explosions and ambulance sirens.'

At 7.05am the first air raid sirens were heard in central Kiev.

A CNN reporter in Kiev reported hearing blasts live on air in the early hours of Thursday morning.

'I just heard a big bang right here behind me. I've never heard anything like it,' said Matthew Chance, senior international correspondent for the network.

Donald Trump claims that the invasion was sparked by 'election fraud' in 2020 Donald Trump, speaking to Fox's Laura Ingraham on Wednesday night as the Kremlin's 'special military operation' began, claimed that the so-called 'Russia hoax' ruined his good relationships with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi, arguing he kept the two apart. Ingraham asked Trump about the continuing closeness between Putin and Xi. 'Well, I had a good relationship with both,' he said. 'It was hurt by the Russia hoax. You see what happened with Durham and those reports and other reports including Mueller. 'It was just a made up hoax and it really hurt our country but despite the hoax, I had a good relationship and with President Xi of China, other than the fact that I was tariff-ing and taxing the hell out of him. 'As a young man growing up, I always heard that the worst thing that could happen is drive those two countries together. 'It really started with Obama and energy. He drove them together because one needed the energy and the other needed the money,' Trump added. 'He drove them together and Biden - I kept them apart - and Biden now it's a great love fest and that's a very bad thing and I think you can probably add Iran into it too.' Earlier in the interview, in which Trump spoke over the phone with Ingraham, Trump bemoaned that this was happening at all. 'This should have never happened. This would not have happened during my administration. 'In fact, some people are saying why didn't this take place over the last four years?' Advertisement

Chance said that he heard between seven and eight explosions and quickly put on his flak jacket and headgear while he continued to report from a balcony in the Ukrainian capital.

'There are big explosions taking place.

'I can't see them or explain what they are.

'But I will tell you the U.S has warned the Ukrainian authorities there could be air strikes and ground attacks as well around the country, including the capital.

'I don't know if that's what's occurring now but it's a remarkable coincidence that the explosions come just minutes after Putin gave his speech,' Chance explained.

'This is the first time we've heard anything. It has been absolutely silent.

'This is the first time. It has to be more than just a coincidence.

'I think it's safe where I am. I have a flak jacket,' Chance remarked, before ducking down to put on his protective gear.

He suggested that the blasts he heard in the Ukrainian capital were still some distance away from the center.

'It was so quiet in Ukraine tonight up until those explosions,' Chance explained.

The blasts came within minutes of Putin saying Russia would conduct a military operation in eastern Ukraine.

Explosions could also be heard from Ukraine in the Russian city of Belgorod.

Putin told Russians: 'I have decided to conduct a special military operation.

'Russia cannot exist with a constant threat emanating from the territory of Ukraine.

'You and I have been left with no opportunity to protect our people other than the one we use today.'

It comes after explosions were also heard near the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, as fears mounted that shelling is underway.

Residents in the city, which is located in south eastern Ukraine, have been woken up at 3.30am by blasts 30 miles from the Russian border.

Video footage appeared to show clouds of smoke rising up into the night sky near Mariupol, but it was unconfirmed whether it was as a result of shelling.

Putin earlier this week said he wanted to take the major Azov Sea Port of Mariupol, which handles 50 percent Ukraine's steel and mineral exports.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Russia's actions were a 'grave breach of international law' and that allies would meet to address the 'renewed aggression'.

He said on Twitter: 'I strongly condemn #Russia's reckless attack on #Ukraine, which puts at risk countless civilian lives.

'This is a grave breach of international law & a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security. #NATO Allies will meet to address Russia's renewed aggression.'

The British foreign secretary Liz Truss tweeted her condemnation of the attack just after 4am local time.

'I strongly condemn the appalling, unprovoked attack President Putin has launched on the people of Ukraine,' she said.

'We stand with Ukraine and we will work with our international partners to respond to this terrible act of aggression.'

The explosions come just hours after the U.S. warned the Ukrainian government that Putin's troops are 'ready to go now' with an invasion of Ukraine, with 80 percent of Russian soldiers now assembled around the country in attack positions.

U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken issued a further stark warning and said, hours before the invasion, that he believed Russia would invade before the night is over.

Russia on Wednesday afternoon issued a notice to airmen (NOTAM) which closed the airspace along its northeastern border with Ukraine to all civilian air traffic.

Ukraine later said early on Thursday it had restricted civilian flights in its airspace due to 'potential hazard'.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed that the Ukrainian people will 'fight back' if Putin threatens their freedom and lives by launching a full-scale invasion.

President Zelenskyy made an emotional address to his nation after Moscow-backed rebel leaders in eastern Ukraine asked Putin for military assistance in fending off Ukrainian 'aggression'.

In an emotional televised address on Wednesday night, President Zelenskyy said: 'The people of Ukraine and the government of Ukraine want peace.

'But if we come under attack, if we face an attempt to take away our country, our freedom, our lives and lives of our children, we will defend ourselves.

'When you attack us, you will see our faces, not our backs.'

The Ukrainian president said he had tried to call Putin this evening, but there was 'no answer, only silence', adding that Moscow now has around 200,000 soldiers by Ukraine's borders.

The United Nations Security Council quickly scheduled an emergency meeting Wednesday night - the second in three days - at Ukraine's request.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called the separatists' request 'a further escalation of the security situation.'

Earlier on Wednesday, Ukraine was placed on a war footing: A state of emergency was declared and approved by parliament, 200,000 military reservists called up, border zones were restricted and three million Ukrainians told to leave Russia, with Kiev acknowledging for the first time that an attack could now take place anywhere, at any time.

Biden on Wednesday warned President Zelenskyy of an 'imminent' attack by Putin's troops in the next 48 hours - , just hours after Ukraine was hit by a 'massive' cyberattack targeting its government and banks.

But Blinken cut that time frame of a Russian invasion drastically and said on Wednesday night he expected Russia to invade Ukraine before the night was over.

U.S. intelligence chiefs knew Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, was at particular risk of being targeted in a Russian invasion as it is close to the Ukrainian-Russian border.

On Wednesday night, a huge military convoy of more than 100 trucks with soldiers were heading in the direction of the city.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10545389/BREAKING-NEWS-Explosions-heard-Ukraine-port-city-Mariupol.html

Ration for 1 week

Hiding since Feb 24

Many stuck at the borders

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Though India is leaving no stone unturned in its attempt to evacuate its nationals from Ukraine , there are still nearly 2,000 Indian students in Kyiv, out of the 15,000-odd Indians in Ukraine.""We are left with food for today only,"" 21-year-old Shana Shaji of Kerala said over the phone from Ukraine's Kharkiv city, hiding inside a metro bunker as the Russian military assault on the country rages on.Shaji, a medical student, and her friends had shifted to the metro station on Thursday when Russia launched its military offensive.Connected with the outside world with just their mobile phone, Shaji said they are unaware of what is happening outside the station.Thinking the situation has improved, they had tried to exit the metro station but ran back in after spotting military vehicles on the roads.The metro stations have turned into bunkers as people have taken shelter to escape bombardment amid the raging military conflict.People in these ""bunkers"" are becoming increasingly despondent as they are running out of food supplies, Shaji said.""When I entered the metro station. I thought I will be evacuated soon but it has been three days,"" the fourth-year medical student said in a heavy voice.""We don't have food supplies. What will we do now? No ATM is dispensing cash,"" Shaji added.Majority of the people in the metro station are Indian citizens, she said, adding they are sleeping on platforms and have used mattresses and blankets to prepare makeshift beds. They sleep in shifts to ensure the safety of the group.While several are stuck in bunkers, others chose to leave on foot to reach the land borders.With Ukraine closing its airspace after Russia launched the military operation, the Indian government sent teams to the land borders with Ukraine in Hungary, Poland, the Slovak Republic and Romania to assist in the evacuation of Indian nationals.India has positioned teams of officials at the Zahony border post in Hungary, Krakowiec as well as the Shehyni-Medyka land border points in Poland, Vysne Nemecke in the Slovak Republic and the Suceava transit point in Romania to coordinate the exit of Indian nationals from Ukraine.Shaji said that a few of her friends have left for Poland. ""I have lost contact with them. I have no idea where they are. My friend texted me that she is leaving for Poland. There was no further communication.""The situation, however, is calmer in several western cities, including Lviv.A first-year medical student, Kanishk, said panic gripped the city on the first day of the military invasion by Russian troops.""People were panic buying, supermarkets ran out of supplies. Foreign nationals faced more problems because ATMs were not dispensing cash,"" he said.Unlike other cities, the situation is slightly better there now, he added.Kharkiv, around 500 km north-east from Kyiv, is inhabited by several 100 Indian families. They have been living in the city for the past two to three decades. Most of them are engaged in trading or have big grocery shops in the embattled city.Dinesh Singh, a native of Shikohabad in Uttar Pradesh , is one of them. He has been living in Kharkiv for the last 25 years. He along with his wife and 12-year-old son moved into a bunker near his house. Two other Indian families have also taken shelter into the bunker like him.Singh said, ""We woke up with the sound of bombing on February 24 and were forced to take shelter in the nearby bunker. It is just 8x7 feet in size. Two other Indian families are also with us."" He also said that bombing is continuing on the outskirts of Kharkiv since Saturday morning.""The bunker is small for nine people and we often have to go upstairs to get a whiff of fresh air. The tiny shelter has only one bulb connection to illuminate the makeshift facility. We can't lie on the floor, so we are taking a nap only while sitting,"" he told IANS.Singh said that all shopping malls and grocery shops are closed now and they are left with ration that will sustain for a week or so.""We will see what happens after a week (about ration and other essential supplies). There was a big queue at ATMs and long traffic jams on highways because many people are fleeing to the Romanian border to get refuge in the neighbouring country, as the war seems to be unrelenting,"" Singh said.Aniket Banerjee, the first Indian to train to be a veterinary surgeon at Kyiv's National University of Life and Environmental Sciences, is scared but tries to sound confident as he speaks on the phone from his varsity's Soviet-era bunker built during the 'Cold War' against possible Nato attacks.The 22-year-old man from Santragachi in West Bengal's Howrah district, famous for a lake where migratory birds from Russia spend their winter, has been hiding in a bunker along with fellow students since Thursday, to save himself from the aerial bombardment the Russian air force has been carrying out in his vicinity.Banerjee and several thousands of Indians have decided on the option of staying put for a variety of reasons.""Last night, there were gun-fights between Russian and Ukrainian troops, and we heard sounds of aerial bombardments… but we are safe. Please convey that message. We don't want our parents to panic,"" Banerjee, who has been networking with the Indian embassy in his city as well as other students, told PTI over phone.Initially, there was fear and hunger as the sound of artillery grew nearer and food ran low, ""but we managed to stock up. We are good for another four days or so,"" he said.His university is to the south of the city centre and did not seem as yet to be a target for the war.The fighting, he said, is directed towards the centre of Kyiv city, ""where President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his top officials are holed up. We are told the Russians want to minimise damage to civilian areas and aim for the centre… but missiles and shrapnel are flying, especially at night.""""There are no instructions from the embassy as yet to leave this safe place… frankly the western border with Poland is far from here, nearly 600-700 km. Metros have stopped (train and bus services are uncertain if not totally shut down).""So, we students who have been talking to each other feel it is best to bunker down till our government manages to arrange Indian Air Force relief flights to Kyiv,"" said the trainee vet.Manogya Bora, 19, along with a group of friends, left the city of Lviv in western Ukraine to reach the Poland border.""So first, at 11 am yesterday (Friday) we reached Rava-Ruska, the first border crossing to Poland after the advisory from the Indian embassy. We walked for eight kilometres. Many people reached the border but they said they are not allowing people to cross. So we came back. We went to another city by walking 18-20 km. Then we stopped at some shelter. Now, we have reached the border,"" Bora, a medical student from Uttarakhand, said.When she reached the border, she said she was stunned to see the sea of people who were waiting with bags to cross.She shared several videos with PTI in which hundreds of people can be seen at the checkpoint, trying to cross the border into Poland. Several people were seen sobbing, with stress and lack of sleep clearly visible on their faces.Mothers were seen trying to calm their babies wailing continuously.""My situation is very bad. We are tired. I hope we can pass through this checkpoint,"" Bora said.Amid the chaos and confusion, 21-year-old medical student Mehul Rathore and his elder sister Meghna travelled in a bus for 200 kilometres from the Ukrainian city of Ternopil and walked for around 20 kilometres at night in freezing cold to reach the Ukraine-Poland border to seek safe shelter in Poland, but they have no option other than waiting in a long queue, that too in uncertainty.This is the situation of a few hundred others who are somehow reaching the Shehyni-Medyka border, only to face chaos and get stranded as they are not being allowed to cross the border, which is witnessing huge gatherings of people wanting safe shelter.At a distance of 630 kilometres from this border, Ayushi Vishnoi, her friends and many others are stuck in a hostel building in Kyiv, witnessing bombing, hearing frequent sirens and switching between the rooms and the underground bunkers, silently praying to god to keep them safe.""Many students have reached the Poland border, but there is no advisory for the students stuck in Kyiv. We want a safe passage to the border and the Indian embassy should arrange this. I have tried so many times but could not get through the helpline number provided by the embassy. I shared my details and explained the situation on a WhatsApp number. The message was seen, but there was no reply,"" the student of the National Medical University in Kyiv said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indians-still-in-ukraine-take-shelter-in-bunkers-running-low-on-cash-and-food/articleshow/89853836.cms
4,ece5916b-a857-44c9-ba7f-95ad10e96691,"['Https', 'Please Enter Your Name Here']",2022-02-25 00:00:00,"All Ukrainian border guards protecting a tiny island in the Black Sea from Russian invaders were killed yesterday after refusing to surrender to warmonger Vladimir Putin’s forces and defiantly telling a Kremlin warship: ‘Go f**k yourselves!’.

The small contingent of soldiers, reportedly 13 in number, were posted on Snake Island in the Odessa region near NATO ally Romania and were defending the territory after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine early Thursday morning.

In a radio message, the soldiers were told by a sailor on board the vessel: ‘This is Russian military warship. I suggest you lay down your weapons and surrender to avoid bloodshed and needless casualties. Otherwise, you will be bombed.’ However, the Ukrainian troops defiantly refused to give up the territory, and instead replied: ‘Go f**k yourselves!’.

The Russian soldiers on radio are heard muttering the curse back at the Ukrainians, before all the border guards were killed in an aerial bombardment. Their deaths were later acknowledged by Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky.

A video circulating on Twitter also appeared to show the moment that the island was shelled. It showed a Ukrainian soldier staring at a camera before a shell landed nearby.

On Thursday afternoon, Ukraine’s interior ministry had said Snake Island, which is also called Zmiinyi, had been attacked by Russian forces.

The island is ruled by Ukraine but sits just miles from the coast of Romania. Snake Island is strategically important because it will allow Russia to claim territorial waters stretching 12 nautical miles out to sea. They cover important shipping channels to the port cities of Odessa, Mykolaiv and Kherson.

After taking the island, Russia would have been able to cut off the shipping channels, isolating Ukraine from international markets and depriving its economy of vital trade revenues as it seeks to defend itself.

Fire fighters are seen responding to a blaze at a residential building in Kyiv in the early hours of Friday

The Kyiv apartment block is seen ablaze on Friday morning. It is unclear what caused the fire

Kyiv was ablaze in the early hours of Friday as the city came under attack from Russia. Ukrainian Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashenko shared footage on social media of a blaze in what he said was the Darnitsky district of Kyiv, in the southeast of the city on the left bank of the Dnipro river

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss kicks out Russian ambassador following ‘very grumpy meeting’ after summoning him to Whitehall over Ukrainian invasion Moscow’s ambassador to the UK was berated by Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who told him the invasion of Ukraine had made Russia an ‘international pariah’ that would suffer vast costs. Ms Truss was understood to have kicked out Andrei Kelin after he repeated the Kremlin’s propaganda during what was characterised as a ‘very grumpy meeting’ on Tuesday. The Foreign Office said Ms Truss told Mr Kelin to expect ‘severe sanctions’ against Russia as she accused the country he represents of having ‘repeatedly lied’. Mr Kelin had been summoned to Whitehall for a dressing down for the second time in a week after the Kremlin began an assault on Ukraine that is feared will amount to an all-out invasion. According to a Foreign Office statement, Ms Truss told him that Russia must expect a ‘long, protracted conflict that would inflict a huge human, economic and political cost on the Russian government’. ‘The Foreign Secretary said the Russian government had repeatedly lied about having no plans to invade Ukraine, and its unprovoked aggression had made it an international pariah,’ it added.

Ukraine’s capital was under bombardment in the early hours of Friday, with the skies ablaze as Putin’s tanks moved to within 20 miles of Kyiv.

Ukraine’s deputy defense ministry said that one missile was shot out of the sky by their anti-missile defense systems. Another missile struck a residential building in the city, the government said.

A Ukrainian jet, a SU-27, was shot down by a surface-to-air missile in a separate incident, the Ukrainian government said.

The country has 125 combat-capable aircraft, including 4th-generation fighter workhorses Sukhoi Su‑27 and Mikoyan MiG‑29, according to Military Balance 2021. Russia has more than 1,500 fighter jets.

Ukrainian Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashenko shared footage on social media of a blaze in what he said was the Darnitsky district of Kyiv, in the southeast of the city on the left bank of the Dnipro river.

It was unclear whether the Darnitsky fire was caused by the downed Ukrainian jet, or the Russian missiles.

Hours earlier, Zelensky raged at Western ‘cowards’ who failed to come to his aid, saying his country is being ‘left alone’ to face Russian troops. Officials warn that Kyiv will be seized this weekend.

In a video address to his nation after midnight, the president called his fallen compatriots ‘heroes’ after 137 were killed on the first day of fighting, and insisted he will stay until the bitter end.

He said: ‘They’re killing people and turning peaceful cities into military targets. It’s foul and will never be forgiven. We have been left alone to defend our state. Who is ready to fight alongside us? I don’t see anyone.

‘Who is ready to give Ukraine a guarantee of NATO membership? Everyone is afraid.’

He added that the enemy has already entered Kyiv and urged residents to be vigilant and observe curfew rules, acknowledging he was ‘target number one’.

The Ukrainian capital is expected to be surrounded by Russian forces this weekend and the country’s resistance effectively crippled, US security officials fear.

Troops are already closing in on the seat of Ukrainian power after taking control of the strategic Chernobyl nuclear power plant today, and will seize it within 96 hours, bringing a ‘new Iron Curtain’ down on Europe, Zelensky warned.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Putin plans to encircle Ukrainian forces in Kyiv and force them to either surrender or be destroyed, and the leadership of Ukraine could then fall in a week.

A former senior US intelligence officer told Newsweek: ‘After the air and artillery end and the ground war really starts, I think Kyiv falls in just a few days. The military may last slightly longer but this isn’t going to last long.’

EU blocks our bid to punish Russia: Anger as union refuses to kick Moscow out of global bank payment system while West imposes sanctions over Ukraine war The European Union faced an angry backlash last night after frustrating British efforts to kick Russia out of the world’s biggest financial payments system. In a call with G7 leaders yesterday, Boris Johnson pressed the case for suspending Russia from Swift, which is used to conduct about half of its international trade. But the move was kicked into the long grass because of opposition from a number of EU countries. Ukraine yesterday urged the West to trigger the move, with foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba warning that those who refused would have ‘blood on their hands’. Downing Street yesterday declined to comment on which countries had opposed the move. But Joe Biden last night indicated the opposition had come from EU states. Asked whether Russia should be cut off from Swift, the US President said: ‘It is always an option but right now that’s not a position that the rest of Europe wishes to take.’ The Belgian-based Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (Swift) is a mechanism for making secure payments overseas and is widely used in international trade.

A source close to the Ukrainian government said they agreed that Kyiv will be surrounded within 96 hours but believed the government will stay strong and not collapse.

In a bid to thwart the imminent capture of the city, Emmanuel Macron spoke to Putin on Thursday night, who gave the French leader an ‘exhaustive’ explanation of his justification for war.

The Kremlin said the call took place at Macron’s initiative, and he and Putin agreed to stay in contact.

Zelensky has also signed a decree on the general mobilisation of the population within 90 days, but men aged 18-60 are banned from leaving the country.

It comes after Russian forces seized control of Chernobyl nuclear power plant after a ‘fierce’ battle, with the condition of nuclear storage facilities ‘unknown’, sparking fears of a radiation leak that could cause fallout in Europe.

Video revealed Russian tanks and armoured vehicles standing in front of the destroyed reactor, which sits just 60 miles north of the capital Kyiv.

An official said Russian shelling hit a radioactive waste repository and an increase in radiation levels was reported, although this has not yet been corroborated.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said it is following the situation in Ukraine ‘with grave concern’ and appealed for maximum restraint to avoid any action that may put Ukraine’s nuclear facilities at risk.

Ukrainian presidential advisor Myhailo Podolyak said: ‘After the absolutely senseless attack of the Russians in this direction, it is impossible to say that the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is safe.’

Meanwhile Turkey reported that one of its ships had been hit by a ‘bomb’ off the coast of Odessa, where fighting is also going on. Turkey is a member of NATO, underlining fears that the war in Ukraine could quickly suck in other states and spark an all-out conflict in Europe.

Speaking after the latest developments, Joe Biden announced more sanctions against Russia but admitted that he had not expected previous threats of financial penalties to deter Putin.

He also resisted calls to send in US troops to Ukraine, saying he has no plans to speak to the Russian leader who he accuses of trying to rebuild a Soviet empire.

The sanctions will target Russian banks, oligarchs, state-controlled companies and high-tech sectors, but Russian oil and natural gas were exempt in a bid to avoid disruption to global markets.

‘Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences,’ Biden said in remarks at the White House.

Elsewhere, Kyiv ordered civilians into bomb shelters and declared a curfew amid concerns Russia is about to strike the capital as Ukrainian troops lost control of a key airfield around 15 miles away. Russian forces had attacked it with around two dozen attack helicopters earlier in the day, four of which are thought to have been shot down.

Biden warns Putin that the US will be ‘involved’ if he moves into NATO countries as Ukraine hands out 10,000 assault rifles to citizens: President still insists he won’t send American forces into Kyiv – but deploys 7,000 to Germany President Joe Biden on Thursday warned Vladimir Putin that U.S. forces will defend NATO territory if he broadens his assault beyond Ukraine, and said he was ordering more troops to Europe. Soon after he spoke the Pentagon said 7000 extra personnel and hardware were being deployed to Germany. In a White House speech, Biden slapped a new round of sanctions on Russia and promised that Putin’s country would bear the consequences of his aggression against Ukraine. He said American forces would not engage with Russian troops in Ukraine. ‘Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO allies and reassure those allies in the east,’ he said. ‘As I made crystal clear, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power.’ In a question-and-answer session with reporters, he was asked if that meant American soldiers would fight if Russia attacked NATO territory. ‘If he did move into NATO countries we will be involved,’ he said. ‘We will be involved.’

The Ukrainian army was yesterday fighting in almost every region of the country, battling the Russians for control of military bases, airports, cities and ports from Kharkiv to Kyiv, and Donetsk to Odessa.

Putin personally gave the order to attack around 5am on Thursday, unleashing a salvo of rocket fire that American intelligence said involved more than 100 short and medium-range ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and surface-to-air missiles, and 75 bombers that targeted military sites including barracks, warehouses and airfields in order to knock out the country’s military command structure.

Russia said the strikes destroyed 74 Ukrainian military ground facilities, 11 airfields, three command posts and 18 radar stations controlling Kyiv’s anti-aircraft batteries.

That was followed by attacks from Crimea in the south towards the city of Kherson, a northern advance from Belarus to Kyiv, and an eastern advance from Belgorod towards Kharkiv where the heaviest fighting is going on.

American officials said this was merely an ‘initial phase’ of the attack, and that the majority of Russia’s 190,000 troops at the front remain in reserve. The goal of the attack is to ‘take key population centres’ and ‘decapitate the Ukrainian government’, the officials added.

Ukraine’s health ministry said so far 137 people have been killed on the first day of conflict, while 300 have been wounded.

The port cities of Mariupol and Odessa, where Ukraine’s main naval bases are located, were also attacked – though Odessa appeared to remain under Ukrainian control as of Thursday afternoon. Russian tankers blockaded the Kerch Strait, leading from the Back Sea to the Sea of Azov, cutting off Mariupol.

Ukraine has hit back, shooting down five Russian helicopters, destroying dozens of tanks and capturing Russian troops.

A Russian AN-26 military transport aircraft also crashed in the southern Voronezh region, killing its crew on board.

The accident could have been caused by a technical failure and has not inflicted any damage on the ground, Interfax said, citing a press office of Russia’s western military district.

In the address to his nation, Zelensky also described Russia as ‘evil’ and said Putin had attacked ‘like a suicidal scoundrel… just as Fascist Germany did in World War II’.

He had earlier called on all Ukrainian citizens willing to defend their homeland to step forward, saying guns will be issued to everyone who wants one.

He also asked for civilians to give blood to help wounded troops. And he asked world leaders to impose the ‘harshest sanctions possible’ on Putin.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, addressing the nation at midday, said western allies are preparing a ‘massive’ package of sanctions against Russia and told the people of Ukraine: ‘We cannot and will not just look away.’ Johnson referred to Putin as a ‘dictator’ who would never ‘subdue the national feeling of the Ukrainians’.

As the West prepared to cut off Russia financially, Putin summoned his oligarchs to demand loyalty over his attack on Ukraine – perhaps fearing a rebellion from within after prominent Russian TV figures and celebrities spoke out to oppose the conflict.

Speaking in the Kremlin, he said that Russia had been ‘forced’ to take action over Ukraine and had ‘no other choice’ but to attack, saying the country remains ‘part of the global economy’ and that he ‘will not hurt the system we belong to’. ‘I want you to show solidarity with the government,’ he told them.",https://finnoexpert.com/2022/02/25/russian-warship-go-f-yourselves-final-words-of-ukrainian-border-guards-on-snake-island/

Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine is leading hacking groups worldwide to increase their activities — in some cases to support a side, or possibly just to capitalize on the chaos.

Since the invasion of Ukraine earlier this week, the Anonymous hacker collective, the Conti ransomware gang and a threat actor in Belarus are among those that appear to have gotten more active — or at least expressed intensions to be. Meanwhile, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a warning Thursday about a growing threat from an Iranian advanced persistent threat (APT) actor.

During the Cold War, “the superpowers fought many small wars by proxy,” said Sam Curry, CSO at Cybereason. “Today, we can expect a cyber proxy war to emerge.”

Anonymous

Anonymous has declared itself aligned with “Western allies” and said it would only target operations in Russia. The group has posted a number of claims on Twitter.

On Thursday, Anonymous claimed on Twitter that it brought down numerous websites associated with the Russian government. Those included a state news site, RT News, which reportedly confirmed that it had experienced a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.

Calling the news site “propaganda,” Anonymous said the DDoS attack was carried out “in response to Kremlin’s brutal invasion of #Ukraine.”

Then on Friday, Anonymous tweeted that it has “successfully breached and leaked the database of the Russian Ministry of Defence website,” and claimed to have posted “all private data of the Russian MOD.”

The group had earlier tweeted a video, featuring its signature Guy Fawkes-masked figure, saying that “if tensions continue to worsen in Ukraine, then we can take hostage industrial control systems.”

The involvement of Anonymous is not a surprise, since the group is “well-known for having a principled position on topics and then acting or retaliating via the Internet,” said Casey Ellis, founder and CTO at Bugcrowd.

Conti

Also unsurprisingly, Conti — believed to be a state-sponsored group operating out of Russia responsible for hundreds of ransomware attacks in recent years — threw its support behind the Russian side.

According to reports, Conti posted a message on its site on the dark web, saying that “the Conti Team is officially announcing a full support of Russian government.”

“If anybody will decide to organize a cyberattack or any war activities against Russia, we are going to use our all possible resources to strike back at the critical infrastructures of an enemy,” the message said, according to reports.

The statement “represents the first major cybercriminal group to publicly back the Russian war effort,” said Chris Morgan, senior cyber threat intelligence analyst at Digital Shadows.

It also comes after many warnings from U.S. officials, who’ve emphasized that “the risk from ransomware activity may escalate as sanctions impact Russia,” Morgan said.

Digital Shadows has identified Conti as the second most active ransomware group in 2021, by number of victims, and has attributed several attacks against critical national infrastructure to the group — including the crippling ransomware attack against Ireland’s health service in May 2021.

Conti’s position statement is “noteworthy in light of Russia’s recent crackdowns on cybercrime and ransomware,” Ellis said. “It signals to me that they are either acting independently as the other groups seem to be, or possibly operating with the Kremlin’s blessing.”

Meanwhile, in Ukraine, the country’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) blamed “UNC1151,” a hacking group whose “members are officers of the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Belarus,” for a wave of phishing attacks.

The attacks targeted Ukrainian military personnel, as well as “related individuals,” CERT said in a Facebook post.

MuddyWater

In the midst of the Russian attacks on Ukraine on Thursday, CISA posted a warning about MuddyWater, a state-sponsored Iranian APT. The group has been observed “conducting cyber espionage and other malicious cyber operations targeting a range of government and private-sector organizations across sectors—including telecommunications, defense, local government, and oil and natural gas—in Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America,” CISA wrote in a post.

The timing of the disclosure “is interesting with the Ukraine cyberattacks and conflict playing out in parallel,” said Drew Schmitt, principal threat intelligence analyst for GuidePoint Security.

The disclosure suggests the possibility “this could be Iran stepping up operations based on a distracted world view,” though that’s not definitive, Schmitt said.

In general, the development shows that as more nations are developing cyber capabilities, more are coming to play, according to John Bambenek, principal threat hunter at Netenrich. And “there is no better training ground for nation-state actors than playing in an active warzone,” Bambenek said.

Seizing the opportunity

Without a doubt, some groups — and nation-state actors — will use the Ukraine invasion as an opportunity to escalate their ongoing cyberattacks “amidst the global chaos,” said Richard Fleeman, vice president for penetration testing ops at Coalfire.

Looking ahead, “I believe we will see the continual escalation,” Fleeman said. “These groups thrive on sentiment and will likely continue to build momentum based on their objectives.”

Curry agreed, saying that more groups “will pile in, and in the confusion other actors will conduct operations with plausible deniability.”

“Let’s all hope that sanity prevails, but let’s prepare our policies and our preparations with the expectation that peace is probably further away that anyone would like,” he said.

Ellis said that one concern with the development is the relative difficulty of attribution in cyberattacks — as well as the possibility of incorrect attribution or “even an intentional false flag operation escalating the conflict internationally.”

‘Unprecedented’ situation

While all sectors of industry should be aware of the possible repercussions from the increased hacker group activity, certain sectors in the west may be more likely to be targeted, Morgan said.

The financial services sector and energy sector would be “at particular risk, should Russia-aligned threat groups target organizations they assess as equivalent to those impacted by western sanctions,” he said.

In many ways, this is uncharted territory, given that the world hasn’t had a war like this occur at a time when cyber capabilities were so advanced and widespread. It’s an “unprecedented” situation, said Danny Lopez, CEO of Glasswall — but it’s “not unexpected.”

“Cyber has joined land, sea and air to become the fourth conflict theatre,” Lopez said. And whether it’s state-sponsored groups or their proxies, “I think cyber is the new war frontier,” he said.
