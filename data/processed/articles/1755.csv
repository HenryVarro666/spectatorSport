Governments wary of rising energy prices

LUXEMBOURG, April 11 (Reuters) - The European Union's executive is drafting proposals for an EU oil embargo on Russia, the foreign ministers of Ireland, Lithuania and the Netherlands said on Monday, although there was no agreement to ban Russian crude.

Many of the ministers meeting in Luxembourg showed support for sanctions on Russian oil imports, the EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell said, but for others, such a ban would constitute an ""asymmetric shock"", he said. The bloc agreed, however, to intensify the delivery of weapons to Ukraine, Germany said.

""They are now working on ensuring that oil is part of the next sanctions package,"" Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said of the European Commission.

Targeting Russian oil, which makes up about a quarter of the EU's crude imports, is seen as the EU's next step as it seeks to pressure Russia to halt the shelling of Ukrainian cities following Moscow's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.

Galvanised by what Ukraine says are senseless killings of civilians by Russian troops since the invasion, the bloc last week approved a fifth round of sanctions on Russia that included an end to Russian coal imports.

Russia has denied targeting civilians in what it calls a ""special operation"" to ""denazify"" its southern neighbour.

""Nothing is off the table, including sanctions on oil and gas,"" Borrell said. He has previously said an embargo must happen ""sooner or later"". The European Parliament last week voted for an embargo, although its decision is not binding.

'COORDINATED PLAN'

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on April 5 that she was considering additional sanctions, including on oil imports, based in part on proposals from EU governments. Those ideas include imposing tariffs on Russian oil, or a ban on some oil products. Borrell said EU states were also working independently to reduce their dependency.

Any oil embargo rests on both the technical details of the scope and phase-in time of such a move and the support of the EU's 27 member states. Energy dependence varies across the bloc, with countries such as Bulgaria almost totally dependent on Russian oil. Hungary has said it cannot support an oil embargo.

Germany's position, as the EU's biggest economy, will be crucial. While offering Ukraine more weapons, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock called for a ""coordinated plan to completely phase out fossil fuels"" from Russia. EU diplomats said Berlin is not actively supporting an immediate embargo.

The United States and Britain have banned Russian oil, hoping to cut off a significant source of revenue for Moscow. The decision is harder for Europe's economy due to its dependency and could push up already high energy prices.

1,fda9f0da-2349-4ce1-b99f-9ac294bbf6a8,[],2022-04-12 00:00:00,"The European Union has dared to break a taboo that a few months ago would have been unthinkable: banning Russian fossil fuels, the precious supplies on which the bloc so heavily depends.

The radical measure came only after leaders were confronted with brutal images of indiscriminate killings in Bucha, a suburb near Kyiv. The massacre triggered an international outcry and raised the most serious accusations yet of war crimes levelled against Moscow, who vigorously denied any involvement.

Upon seeing the horrors of Bucha, member states decided to self-impose a 120-day deadline to completely phase out imports of Russian coal. The ground-breaking move was meant to complement previous rounds of sanctions and help cripple the Kremlin's war machine: the sale of fossil fuel represents Russia's main source of revenue, contributing to over 40% of the federal budget.

But while the announcement from Brussels received initial praise, it was quickly eclipsed by the inaction taken against Moscow's two most profitable exports: oil and gas.

Last year, EU purchases of Russian coal amounted to €5.16 billion, a figure that pales in comparison to the €71 billion spent on petroleum oils and the €16.3 spent on gas.

The power crunch that besets the continent since late summer has further inflated the hefty energy bill. According to Bruegel, a Brussels-based economics think tank, the EU is currently paying Russia €450 million for its oil and €400 million for its gas – on a daily basis.

Josep Borrell, the EU's foreign policy chief, denounced the staggering expenditure before the European Parliament, telling MEPs the bloc has spent €35 billion on Russian fossil fuels since the Ukraine war began and just €1 billion on foreign aid destined to the Kyiv authorities.

That same week, the parliament passed with overwhelming support a non-binding resolution calling for an ""immediate full embargo on Russian imports of oil, coal, nuclear fuel and gas.""

The appeal mirrored that of Poland and the Baltics, who have for weeks been leading the public campaign to abruptly slash Russian energy, arguing the stoppage is the only way to inflict real pain on President Vladimir Putin and force him to negotiate a ceasefire.

Although the Eastern camp has gained new followers in recent days, including Finland's Sanna Marin and France's Emmanuel Macron, the heated conversation is far from settled.

""We are supporting and actually financing Russia's war,"" Marin said last month.

On the other side of the table, Germany and Austria, who are heavily reliant on Russian fuels, have come forward with their concerns regarding a total embargo. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz warned a sudden cut-off would plunge ""all of Europe into a recession"" and his Austrian counterpart, Karl Nehammer, said sanctions are effective when they ""don’t weaken those imposing sanctions against the one who is conducting war.""

Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orbán upped the ante and vowed to veto any attempt to impose an energy embargo because, in his view, it would ""kill"" his country. (Hungary did vote in favour of the coal ban.)

But as Moscow shows no signs of giving up the invasion and reports exposing the war's brutality continue to emerge and outrage, the EU realises the pivotal debate can no longer be postponed. The extraordinary political unity achieved among the 27 member states to stand up to Putin's aggression faces now its greatest test.

Oil ban and the market's geopolitics

Russia is the world’s third largest oil producer behind the United States and Saudi Arabia, putting out about 10.1 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil.

Europe is by far its main client: the continent buys 2.4 million crude barrels every day, together with 1.4 million bpd in other refined products. Germany and the Netherlands alone consume 1.1 million bpd.

This makes Russia the EU's top oil supplier, making up over 25% of total imports and resulting in more than €70 billion spent in 2021.

The Druzhba pipeline, a massive conduit operated by Russia's state-controlled giant Transneft, brings over a million daily barrels directly to refineries in Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Austria and Germany, which then turn the black gold into diesel, naphtha, gasoline and lubricants.

The pipeline has been in place since the 1960s and has fostered a high degree of interdependency between the two sides, who rely on continued and regular supplies to keep business running.

But Druzhba, which ironically means ""friendship,"" is not the only door the EU has to welcome providers. The bloc receives the majority of oil imports through its ports, such as Rotterdam and La Havre, where tankers unload thousands of crude oil barrels and tonnes of refined products.

Should the EU decide to cut off Russian oil, these ports would be key to bypass the physical pipelines and guarantee supplies keep flowing after the embargo is introduced.

""There are a few refineries sitting on this [Druzhba] pipeline who should be the most exposed to a stopping in Russia flows,"" Ben McWilliams, a research analyst at Bruegel, told Euronews.

""Whereas some of the other refineries which are on ports will have an easier time replacing Russian oil imports because, rather than a ship carrying crude oil from Russia, you get a ship carrying crude oil from the Middle East. And with some constraints, you're able to replace crude oil in this way.""

The bloc would need to leverage its power as a wealthy single market to secure the necessary supplies from other oil-producing nations, including Norway, Algeria, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), to compensate for the huge loss of Russian oil.

Sealing these deals could prove difficult, as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), in conjunction with Moscow, has been limiting production since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, claiming global demand is still unstable and under pressure from the virus.

""So far, OPEC countries are not increasing supply at a higher rate than they were prior to the war, which is, from an economic perspective, quite strange given the prices are over $100 a barrel,"" McWilliams said.

""This is likely largely due to other geopolitical reasons and not great relations, particularly with America and the Saudis and the UAE, related to what goes on in the Yemen war, which means they're less likely to help out the US and its allies.""

OPEC has already warned an embargo on Russian oil would create a huge market shock comparable to the 1970s energy crisis, which prompted a long, painful period of stagflation in the West.

""We could potentially see the loss of more than seven million barrels per day of Russian oil and other liquids exports,"" OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo told EU officials in a recent meeting in Vienna, according to a copy of his speech seen by Reuters.

""Considering the current demand outlook, it would be nearly impossible to replace a loss in volumes of this magnitude.""

The challenging circumstances have given rise to intermediary ideas that fall short of a total embargo but that would nevertheless squeeze the Kremlin's war chest.

Among the latest proposals discussed by member states is the possibility of slapping an onerous tariff on Russian oil imports, a burden that would reduce demand across the bloc and force Russian companies to sell barrels at discounted prices. Another idea floated is the establishment of an escrow account into which the bloc would funnel some of its energy payments.

While the political debate remains stuck in an impasse, the private sector is taking matters into its own hands. Some of Europe's leading oil companies, such as Shell, BP, TotalEnergies and Neste, have started the process to wean themselves off Russian oil, fearing reputational damage and tit-for-tat retaliation for Western sanctions.

Gas ban and the limits of diversification

The daunting task of banning Russian oil and all its fearsome consequences are rapidly dwarfed by the greater dilemma of banning Russian gas.

Last year, the EU imported 155 billion cubic metres (bcm) of Russian gas, fulfilling about 40% of the bloc's consumption. Unlike oil, where cargos easily transport supply from port to port, the vast majority of Russian gas travels to the EU through a network of above-ground and underwater pipelines.

Many member states have grown accustomed to this large infrascture. In countries like Germany, Austria, Finland, Hungary and Bulgaria, Russia enjoys a dominant position as the prime or sole gas supplier. Germany has direct access to Nord Stream, a pipeline that brings over 55 bcm a year.

This entrenched dependency has pushed the EU towards a more expensive alternative, liquefied natural gas (LNG), which requires sophisticated terminals that transform the cooled-down liquid back into gas. The US, Qatar, Australia, Nigeria, Algeria, Malaysia, Indonesia and Russia are all major exporters.

As tensions ratcheted up along the Ukraine border in the weeks preceding the invasion, the bloc began to boost its LNG purchases, breaking all-time records in terms of volume. A recent political partnership between the EU and the US will provide the bloc with an extra 15 bcm of America-made LNG. The deal builds upon a separate roadmap unveiled by the European Commission that aims to buy 50 bcm by the end of 2022.

But these ambitious plans are designed to gradually decrease the EU's reliance on Russian gas, not to abolish it overnight. Distributing so much LNG across 27 countries could prove logistically arduous: the bloc's LNG terminals are unevenly distributed, with the majority concentred in coastal nations like Spain and Italy, leaving inland countries in Central and Eastern Europe detached from the system.

""Since the start of the war, the European gas market has been very tight,"" Zongqiang Luo, an analyst at consultancy Rystad Energy, told Euronews.

""All the regasification terminals in Europe are almost running at the full capacity. Especially for the last months, the rate was to the tune of 100% utilisation or close to 95% for the use of gas terminals.""

On top of a limited processing capacity, the EU has to deal with a fierce international demand for LNG. Whereas the bloc's consumption of pipeline gas accounts for over 75% of the global market, the share falls to 16% when it comes to LNG, according to the Commission.

Luo believes the EU could overcome this disadvantage if it offers a ""very high premium price"" that could convince Asian buyers to resell their supplies to their European competitors. However, the expert notes, it would still be ""really hard"" for the EU to meets its gas storage needs without any Russian pipeline gas.

""You can see the European Union is looking for other pipeline alternatives, like the African gas from Algeria and also the gas supplies from Azerbaijan and, of course, Norway,"" Luo said.

Norwegian energy operator Equinor and its partners have committed to bump supplies to EU countries, while Italy and Argelia have struck a deal to bring in an extra 9 bcm between 2023 and 2024.

But the sudden diversification push would be enough to make up for only half of the 155 bcm of gas the bloc gets from Russia, McWilliams warned. Governments would be therefore compelled to ""ask households to cooperate"" to bring consumer demand significantly down.

""It’s possible to save some gas by turning on the heating slightly and by being sensible with the use of energy. It's also going to involve speaking to industry and some industry will have to close down periods of time to manage this,"" he said, hinting some countries would have to rethink their nuclear phase-out.

The halt in production, which has already occurred in some sectors due to soaring electricity bills, would precipitate a dramatic economic slowdown and possibly a recession, the EU's third in the last two years.

Luxembourg (AFP) – Horrified by the devastation wreaked by Russian troops in Ukraine, EU foreign ministers launched discussions Monday on a sixth round of sanctions but a consensus was proving increasingly difficult.

""Discussing about Ukraine means certainly to discuss about the effectiveness of our sanctions,"" Josep Borrell, the European Union's top diplomat, told reporters in Luxembourg as he arrived for the foreign ministers' meeting.

While five rounds of sanctions have already been implemented since Russia's invasion of Ukraine on February 24 -- the last just last Friday -- ""certainly ministers will discuss which are the further steps,"" he said.

The European Union is now committed to what European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen says are ""rolling sanctions"" on Russia. But it has so far held back from those which would hit Moscow's coffers the hardest: a boycott of Russian oil and gas exports.

The fifth round of sanctions includes a ban on Russian coal imports into the EU -- an important first step towards what could become a broader prohibition on energy supplies.

Many ministers arriving for Monday's meeting were in favour of a maximalist approach that would entail banning Russian oil and gas.

But they also stressed the importance of maintaining EU consensus and unity.

One obstacle to widening energy sanctions is Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, an EU leader close with the Russian president who won re-election to a fourth term a week ago.

Orban has refused to take them further. EU sanctions require unanimity from all 27 member states.

Another is the dependence on Russian hydrocarbons by Germany, Austria, Bulgaria, Italy and some other EU countries.

Stop 'financing of war'

Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney acknowledged that the discussions around cutting access to Russian oil was ""very difficult for some member states.""

But, he told reporters, ""the European Union is spending hundreds of millions of euros on importing oil from Russia that is certainly contributing to financing this war"".

""In our view, we need to cut off that financing of war, even though it creates huge challenges and problems.""

Since the start of the war in Ukraine on February 24, the Kremlin has pocketed more than 35 billion euros ($38 billion) in gas, oil and coal sales to the EU, according to Borrell.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Berlin was not opposed to expanding the sanctions, but stressed the need for EU unity to facilitate their adoption.

""We have already made clear as the German federal government that there will be a complete withdrawal from fossil energy, starting with coal, then oil and gas,"" she told reporters.

""In order to implement this together in the European Union, we need a jointly agreed plan to phase out fossil energies completely in the European Union.""

'Toughest sanctions'

Some ministers did little to conceal their frustration with such reserves.

""What needs to happen (for the) EU to have an embargo on oil and gas and other commodities?"" asked Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky, adding that his country wanted to see the ""toughest sanctions we can implement on Russia"".

His Lithuanian counterpart Gabrielius Landsbergis agreed.

""Go to Bucha and see for yourselves why do we need to impose sanctions,"" he said, referring to the town near Kyiv where dozens of bodies were found strewn in the streets after the Russian forces withdrew.

Authorities say hundreds were killed, some with their hands bound, with the town becoming a symbol of the brutality allegedly inflicted under Russian occupation.

Landbergis meanwhile welcomed discussion around a sixth round of sanctions that, he said, included ""oil options"".

""That means that the work has already begun on bringing the consensus together, and I hope that this time it works.""

The ministers were also expected Monday to agree to release an additional 500 million euros ($550 million) to finance fresh weapons deliveries to Kyiv.

""Wars are won or lost on the battlefield,"" said Josep Borrell, head of European diplomacy, upon his arrival at a meeting of foreign ministers in Luxembourg on Monday, April 11. As Ukraine prepares to face a massive Russian offensive in the east of the country, the European Union (E.U) wants to focus on arms deliveries to Kyiv. The E.U also wants to continue to increase economic pressure on Russia and force President Vladimir Putin to retreat. However, on this point, the discussions did not lead to a political consensus on new sanctions, particularly on the question of a ban on Russian oil.

This avenue seems to have been explored more than the ban on gas imports from Russia, which is even more sensitive – the Union depends on it for 40% of its supplies. Doing without Russian oil, which accounts for 26% of their crude, would in theory be easier for Europeans. Not least because alternative suppliers and means of transporting barrels are more accessible than for gas, which arrives in the E.U via complex pipeline infrastructure or LNG carriers. Conversely, Moscow exports two-thirds of its oil to the E.U, which is therefore in a strong position. ""In 2021, the oil import bill (80 billion euros) was four times larger than that of gas (20 billion euros). It is important to start with oil,"" stressed Mr. Borrell.

Berlin, Germany – Some German power plant operators had been preparing for sanctions announced last week for several months already. It was because of suspicious Russian behaviour, they said.

Late on the evening of April 7, the European Union announced a fifth packet of sanctions against Russia because of its invasion of Ukraine. Besides sanctioning individuals and restricting shipping, the EU’s packet included a ban on Russian coal imports from August onwards.

“But we had actually been seeing delays in Russian coal deliveries since last September,” Alexander Bethe, chairperson of the German Association of Coal Importers, admitted on Friday.

His industry association, also known as the VDKi, represents the interests of the imported hard coal market there.

“First we thought it was due to COVID-19,” he told Al Jazeera. “That’s what our Russian partners told us.”

“Then,” added Stephan Riezler, a senior manager at STEAG Group, one of the largest power producers in Germany, “we started seeing pictures of the military build-up on Ukraine’s borders.”

And so some German coal importing companies started searching for alternative suppliers weeks ago.

Last week, a poll of VDKi members found that 79 percent say they would be able to manage without Russian coal.

Last year, Germany imported 41.1 million tons (37 million tonnes) of coal, according to the VDKi.

About half of the country’s hard coal (used for heating) and three-quarters of its steam coal (used for power production) come from Russia. In 2021, Germany paid Russia about 2.2 billion euros ($2.4bn). In total, Europe buys about 8 billion euros ($8bn) worth of coal from Russia annually.

Most of that will now be replaced by shipments from other countries such as Australia, South Africa and Indonesia. There will be higher prices and logistical hassles but coal from Russia could be replaced within a matter of months, a statement by the VDKi noted earlier in March.

But banning Russian coal is viewed as the easiest of the EU’s options on energy sanctions.

Although this fifth round of measures has broken a previous taboo around Russian energy bans, it has also come in for criticism – mainly because it does not touch upon the far larger quantities of gas and oil coming from Russia.

Europe buys about 20 million euros ($21.84m) worth of coal from Russia daily, but spends a further 850 million euros ($928m) a day on Russian oil and gas.

The EU has paid Russia 35 billion euros ($38bn) billion for energy since the beginning of the war and has only given 1 billion euros ($1.09bn) to fund Ukraine’s defence, Europe’s top diplomat Josep Borrell said last week.

Sooner or later, buying Russian oil and gas “will become morally and politically unjustifiable”, Piotr Buras, head of the European Council on Foreign Relations’ Polish office, wrote in an editorial last month.

The German government is in a particularly difficult position when it comes to banning Russian energy imports. Along with several other EU countries, including Hungary and Austria, Germany has been hesitant about imposing a total embargo.

Russian coal makes up about 4.5 percent of Germany’s primary energy inputs, Russian oil about 10.5 percent and Russian gas about 15 percent.

The German government has confirmed its willingness to phase out Russian energy altogether, but it might take a while, the federal economy ministry said in a statement last month.

By autumn, Germany says it wants to have done away with all Russian coal exports and by the end of this year, it will not be importing Russian oil any more; the EU has said it will look at restrictions on Russian oil next.

However, freedom from Russian gas will likely take until mid-2024. Unlike coal or oil, which can be shipped easily, it is harder to reroute natural gas.

“Gas cannot be substituted in the short term,” Germany’s finance minister Christian Lindner said recently. “We would inflict more damage on ourselves than on them.”

“It is still too early for an energy embargo,” the country’s economics minister, Robert Habeck, explained. “The economic and social consequences would still be too severe.”

How severe depends on who you talk to.

Over the past few weeks, there has been feverish debate in Germany about how much damage moving more quickly towards a total embargo could be seen.

German industry organisations and some of the largest companies in the world, like chemical firm BASF and engineering company Siemens, who are major users of Russian natural gas, have warned of “dramatic consequences” of a gas ban. There is the potential for tens of thousands of job losses and having to halt production, they say.

On the other side of the debate, local and foreign economic experts have suggested that, although Germans would face a recession in the event of a partial or total embargo, it would not be any worse than the first year of the COVID-9 pandemic. In 2020, Germany’s national income, or GDP, fell 4.5 percent.

The German economy would adapt, researchers behind one of those studies, a March policy brief produced jointly by the universities of Bonn and Cologne, argued.

“Whether you consider this new [fifth] package of sanctions good or bad, is a political judgement,” Moritz Kuhn, an economics professor at the University of Bonn and one of the co-authors of the brief, told Al Jazeera. “But from the point of view of economic impacts, I would say it [an energy embargo] is manageable.”

Even if there was an embargo tomorrow, Russia’s economy would not be immediately impacted, Simone Tagliapietra, a senior fellow at Brussels-based energy think-tank, Bruegel, pointed out, suggesting it would take several months for the ban to be felt.

There have been other more subtle suggestions made on countering European dependency on Russian energy. That includes an escrow account that withholds profits from Russia, or the setting of a high tariff on Russian energy imports. Working to reduce demand is also important, Tagliapietra added.

The German government is currently promoting energy-saving advice to households, noting that a fifth of gas demand could be reduced simply by changing habits.

A poll published in mid-March reported that 44 percent of Germans believed an immediate ban on Russian energy imports was a good idea. That feeling has grown, as more harrowing evidence of Russian war crimes emerged. More recently, 50 percent felt that way.

And really, that is “the ultimate question,” Tagliapietra told Al Jazeera. “How much are we willing to pay in order to seriously punish aggressions of the sort we are seeing? I think momentum is growing. But we need to be ready to pay the price.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/11/after-the-eus-russia-coal-ban-germany-grapples-with-oil-and-gas

Any oil embargo rests on both the technical details of the scope and phase-in time of such a move and the support of the EU's 27 member states. Energy dependence varies across the bloc, with countries such as Bulgaria almost totally dependent on Russian oil. Hungary has said it cannot support an oil embargo.

Germany's position, as the EU's biggest economy, will be crucial. While offering Ukraine more weapons, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock called for a ""coordinated plan to completely phase out fossil fuels"" from Russia. EU diplomats said Berlin is not actively supporting an immediate embargo.

""They are now working on ensuring that oil is part of the next sanctions package,"" Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said of the European Commission as he arrived for a meeting with his EU counterparts in Luxembourg. ""The European Union is spending hundreds of millions of euros on importing oil from Russia, which is certainly contributing to financing this war. We need to cut off that financing ... the sooner that can happen the better,"" Coveney added.

His Dutch and Lithuanian counterparts also said they were open to looking at ways at targeting Russian oil, which makes up about a quarter of the EU's crude imports, as a means to pressure Russia to halt the shelling of Ukrainian cities. ""We are looking at all other (sanctions), including energy,"" Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra said, a position echoed by EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, who has said an EU oil embargo must happen ""sooner or later"".

The European Parliament last week voted for an embargo, although its decision is not binding. NO CONSENSUS

Galvanized by what Ukraine says are senseless killings of civilians by Russian troops since Moscow's Feb. 24 invasion, the bloc last week approved the fifth round of sanctions on Russia that included an end to Russian coal imports. Russia has denied targeting civilians in what it calls a ""special operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" its southern neighbor.
