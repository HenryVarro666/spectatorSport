The President of Ukraine said on his Twitter page that his country needs “effective international assistance,” which he had discussed with Polish President Andrzej Duda.

He said that sanctions and pressure should be put on the aggressor, Russia.

The Bucharest Nine(B9), a group of the easternmost members of NATO, is meeting in Warsaw today, with President János Áder attending.

The B9 was launched in 2014 as a Polish-Romanian initiative aimed at coordinating positions and exchanging views in the field of security between the nine countries located across the Baltic and Black Sea regions. Its creation was mainly a result of the aggressive attitude shown by Russia following the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in the same year.

The Ukrainian president’s current request, however, may well fall on deaf ears, as Viktor Orbán has repeatedly stated in recent days that he will not allow Hungary to be plunged into war.

“Hungary must stay out of the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine,” Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said on Thursday in a video on Facebook. “What matters most to us is the security of the Hungarian people,” he added.

Orbán said this meant that sending either troops or military equipment to Ukraine was “out of the question, though we will, of course, provide humanitarian aid.”

In a video posted on Facebook early Friday morning, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán reiterated that Hungary will not be allowed to be dragged into this war. This suggests that the Hungarian side will not respond to the Ukrainian request.

Zelensky: Ukraine ‘left alone’

At the same time of his request, Ukraine’s president said Friday in a video address to the nation after midnight that his country had been left on its own to fight Russia.

“We have been left alone to defend our state. Who is ready to fight alongside us? I don’t see anyone. Who is ready to give Ukraine a guarantee of NATO membership? Everyone is afraid, no one answers,” Volodymyr Zelensky added.

The Ukrainian President also expressed his gratitude to those countries that are helping Ukraine not only with words but also with deeds in the midst of the Russian military operation.

Zelensky said that 137 “heroes,” including 10 military officers, had been killed and 316 people wounded. The dead included all border guards on the Zmiinyi Island in the Odessa region, which was taken over by Russians.

Zelensky also said that Russian “sabotage groups” had entered the capital Kyiv, and urged the city’s citizens to remain vigilant and observe a curfew.

Anton Herashchenko said the defenders of Kyiv were ready with anti-tank missiles supplied by foreign allies. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister also agreed with the assessment that Russian forces may enter areas just outside Kyiv today. The minister added that Ukrainian army units are defending positions on four fronts despite being outnumbered. A Ukrainian military official also said Ukrainian forces managed to repel Russian troops near Chernihiv.

This coincides with a report from Ukraine’s defence ministry which earlier said airborne assault troops have blown up a bridge over the Teteriv River at Ivankiv, located about 50km (31 miles) north of Kyiv, in an effort to prevent a Russian column of forces from advancing toward the capital. The ministry said the Russian advance was stopped. Київ↘️

25 Feb 2022 00.59 Peter Beaumont The Guardian’s Peter Beaumont in Ukraine’s western city of Lviv has given his report on the current crisis unfolding around Kyiv. On the second day of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it has become increasingly clear what the Kremlin’s military tactics are: which is very quickly to put pressure on the capital Kyiv. Kyiv is facing threats both from its eastern edges, from the west more generally since the capture of the Chernobyl nuclear plant site, and now, according to Ukrainian officials, from the threat of infiltration into the city. While it’s unclear whether the Russian military intends to capture the Ukrainian capital or force it’s capitulation, a combination of missile attacks, a rapid airborne advance using helicopters to the outskirts, and the continuing advance by Russian armour is putting Kyiv in an increasingly difficult position. The latest update from Ukraine’s General Staff claims that the key Hostomel air base, just outside Kyiv is controlled by Kyiv forces again, however heavy fighting is going on north west of the capital. There are also reports that the Ukrainian military has destroyed at least one bridge to slow the Russian advance, although we know that Russian forces have bridge laying companies. This morning, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the government had information that “subversive groups” were encroaching on the city, while US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Kyiv “could well be under siege” in what U.S. officials believe is a brazen attempt by Russian President Vladimir Putin to dismantle the government and replace it with his own regime. While Zelinskiy said this morning that Russian troops had been halted in most places but even if that is the case, which seems to contradict his comments on encroachment, the situation is serious. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told lawmakers on a phone call Thursday evening that Russian mechanised forces that entered from Belarus were about 20 miles from Kyiv. While there has been some focus on Russian losses inflicted by Ukrainian defenders – including helicopters, soldiers and armoured vehicles – it’s worth pointing out these are so far at the level the Russian military would have priced in for such a quick and aggressive advance and not evidence necessarily any sign so far that the Russian operation is struggling.

Russia launched a dawn offensive on its neighbour and a former member of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, on Thursday as the country woke up to air strikes, piercing air raid sirens and steadily advancing Russian ground forces. Russian forces are dangerously close to the capital Kyiv, which, according to experts, may fall in hours.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called for an ""anti-war coalition"", appealing to the Bucharest Nine - a nine-country bloc formed in 2015 as a result of a perceived aggressive attitude from Russia following the Crimea's annexation in 2014 - for defense aid, sanctions, pressure on the aggressor.
