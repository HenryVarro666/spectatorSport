Shear'],2022-03-22 00:00:00,"“The fact that Russia is generating a large trade and current account surplus because of energy exports means that Russia is generating a constant hard currency flow in euros and dollars,” said Robin Brooks, the chief economist at the Institute of International Finance. “If you’re looking at sanctions evasion or the effectiveness of sanctions, this was always a major loophole.”

The president is scheduled to depart Washington on Wednesday morning before summits on Thursday with NATO, the Group of 7 nations and the European Council, a meeting of all 27 leaders of European Union countries. On Friday, Mr. Biden will head to Poland, where he will discuss the Ukrainian refugees who have flooded into the country since the start of the war. He will also visit with American troops stationed in Poland as part of NATO forces.

Mr. Biden is expected to meet with President Andrzej Duda of Poland on Saturday before returning to the White House later that day.

White House officials said a key part of the announcements in Brussels would be new enforcement measures aimed at making sure Russia is not able to evade the intended impact of sanctions.

“That announcement will focus not just on adding new sanctions,” Mr. Sullivan said, “but on ensuring that there is a joint effort to crack down on evasion on sanctions-busting, on any attempt by any country to help Russia basically undermine, weaken or get around the sanctions.”

He added later, “So stay tuned for that.”

Sanctions experts have suggested that Western allies could allow Russian energy exports to continue but insist that payments be held in escrow accounts until Mr. Putin halts the invasion. That would borrow from the playbook the United States used with Iran, when it allowed some oil exports but required the revenue from those transactions to be held in accounts that could be used only to finance bilateral trade.

The United States and Europe could also broaden their sanctions on Russia’s financial sector and target its major energy companies, Gazprom and Rosneft, without banning oil and gas exports. Such a move would hamper future energy exploration projects and inflict longer-term damage on its production capacity, American officials have said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/22/us/politics/biden-ukraine-europe-trip.html

WASHINGTON—The Biden administration is preparing sanctions on most members of Russia’s State Duma, the lower house of parliament, as the U.S. continues its crackdown on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.

President Biden intends to announce the sanctions on more than 300 members of the Russian State Duma as soon as Thursday during his trip to Europe, where he will meet with allies from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to formulate their next steps, according to U.S. officials and internal documents viewed by The Wall Street Journal.

The sanctions will be announced in coordination with the European Union and members of the Group of Seven industrialized nations, U.S. officials said.

The National Security Council declined to comment.

Sanctions so far have failed to persuade Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and it can’t be determined what effect the action will have on Russian lawmakers.

Planned sanctions packages frequently are postponed, reworked or narrowed during the interagency review process before being finalized and published, an official said.

The upcoming sanctions package, which will also target a number of Russian elites, comes as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine enters its fourth week. The U.S. and European allies have imposed a range of sanctions on Russia, targeting most of its financial institutions, its energy sector and Russian elites.

Sanctions were imposed on Mr. Putin himself last month, as well as on a number of top officials within his government.

So far, Russia’s military progress has been slower than many anticipated and Ukraine’s resistance stronger, but Mr. Putin has shown little interest in de-escalating the crisis.

The Russian Federal Assembly consists of the 450-seat State Duma and a 170-seat upper chamber, the Federation Council.

The Duma, while far less powerful than the Russian president, has acquired expanded constitutional responsibilities in recent years, particularly regarding the country’s economic affairs. It also serves as a link between various segments of the population and the government, relaying grievances and concerns upward, and distributing state assistance to the public.

Last month, Russian lawmakers passed a direct appeal to Mr. Putin to recognize the Russian-controlled separatist states of Donetsk and Luhansk, a move that pre-empted Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

This month, a committee in the State Duma approved a law criminalizing the distribution of what it said was “false news” about Russia’s military operations against Ukraine. The bill included potential prison sentences of up to 15 years.

Biden will announce the new sanctions on 300 members of Russian parliament on Thursday from Brussels, where he will meet with allies from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to plot their next steps to address the war in Ukraine, officials told the Wall Street Journal.

The White House sanctioned Putin directly last month and has so far targeted a slew of political figures and elites that have propped up his regime and cut off Putin's access to banks and business to starve his war chest.

And though the Russian currency, the ruble, dropped down to being worth next to nothing and the nation was last week at risk of defaulting on its debt, sanctions have done little to change the Russian leader's posture.

This week, the ruble stabilized and Russia was able to make interest payments on $117 million due on two bonds denominated in U.S. dollars. And while about half of Russia's $640 billion in foreign reserves is frozen, it has been able to offset that by continued fuel sales to Europe amid a price spike in the cost of oil and gas.

Earlier National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that Biden would unveil the next round of sanctions on Russia and security aid for Ukraine during his trip.

Sullivan said the president would make new announcements about how to help European countries wean themselves off of Russian energy, which has already been banned in the U.S. Russia's oil and gas accounts for about a third of European energy supplies.

'From Brussels, President Biden will travel to Poland where he will engage with US troops, who are now helping to defend NATO territory, and he will meet with experts involved in the humanitarian response,' said Sullivan.

'He will also hold a bilateral meeting with President Duda of Poland.'

Poland has received an influx of more than 2 million Ukrainian refugees.

Duda has already asked for more help in coping with the humanitarian emergency and for military reinforcement.

'We feel that it is the right place for him to go to be able to see troops, to be able to see humanitarian experts and to be able to meet with a frontline and very vulnerable ally,' said Sullivan.

Polish leaders have also floated the prospect of a Western peacekeeping mission intervening in Ukraine, an idea that Washington rejects for fear it would escalate the conflict.

Biden's visit comes as the Russian invasion remains stalled - nearly a month into the war, Russian troops have failed to seize a single major city and their advance has been halted on nearly all fronts by staunch Ukrainian defense.

Now, Ukrainian forces are preparing to retake captured territory as Russian forces battle declining morale - according to the latest Pentagon assessments.

A senior U.S. defense official also said Russian morale was falling.

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

Ukrainian forces have been trying in the last few days to regain territory from the Russians, according to a senior US defense official, who described them as “able and willing” to do so.

Here's the situation on the ground:

Counterattacks near the capital: A Ukrainian counterattack north and west of Kyiv appeared to have made some headway, jeopardizing Russian efforts to encircle the capital and threatening the ability of Russian forces to resupply the forward units that are exposed to the north of the city.

Makariv: One such area is Makariv, a strategic town 30 miles (48 kilometers) west of Kyiv. After days of fighting, Ukrainian forces regained control of the town, the Armed Forces of Ukraine said in a Facebook post Tuesday. CNN could not confirm the claim. Makariv had sustained significant damage from ongoing Russian airstrikes, with video showing widespread devastation. If Ukrainian forces consolidate their control of Makariv, it would become more difficult for Russian forces to secure the western approaches to Kyiv and then push further south.

North of Kyiv: There are also indications that Russian forces have suffered setbacks to the north of Kyiv in areas they have held almost since the beginning of the invasion. A brief video geolocated by CNN showed Ukrainian troops walking in the town of Moschun, about 20 miles (35 kilometers) north of the capital. Ukrainian drone video geolocated during the weekend showed the destruction of Russian armor in the same area.

Flooding of Irpin River: Satellite images from Monday showed growing flooding from the Irpin River. CNN previously reported that a dam along the Dnieper River was flooding the Irpin River basin and its tributaries. The river is critical to the Russian advance toward Kyiv; if the Russians cannot cross it, they can't take Kyiv from the west. It's unclear how the dam began flooding: whether the gates were opened on purpose by the Ukrainians, or it was hit by a military strike.

Borodyanka: Some 12 miles (20 kilometers) north of Makariv is the town of Borodyanka, which has been held by Russian and Chechen forces since early in the campaign. If the Ukrainians were to take Borodyanka, forward Russian units could be cut off. The battlefield is fluid, and the Russians could reverse recent losses. But if the Ukrainians hold Makariv and extend their control over the area, Russian positions between the town and Kyiv would become vulnerable, further impeding their goal of pushing south beyond the main east-west highway to encircle the capital.

Kherson and Mykolaiv: A senior US defense official said Ukrainians are fighting to take back the southern city of Kherson, as well as pushing Russian forces from the northeast of Mykolaiv, forcing them to reposition south of the city. The official cautioned that the US cannot say whether these moves are part of a “larger operational plan” by the Ukrainians or not, but called the Ukrainian defense “nimble” and “agile.""",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-23-22/h_bd16d6b53487d3c44ab53679b8f2086f

The United States plans to sanction approximately 400 Russian individuals and entities, including more than 300 lawmakers from the Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, and Russian elites, a senior Biden administration official said Thursday.

As Russia's unprovoked and increasingly brutal invasion of Ukraine enters its second month Thursday, the G-7 group of major economies and the European Union will also announce new measures to crack down on Russian efforts to evade current sanctions, including those on its central bank.

The EU and G-7 will also inform international organizations that from this point forward, they are no longer to operate within Russia under ""business as usual"" standards, said the official, who requested anonymity in order to preview announcements that had not yet been made public.

""Our purpose here is to methodically remove the benefits and privileges Russia once enjoyed as a participant in the international economic order,"" said the official.

President Joe Biden will announce the measures during a speech before NATO on Thursday, the first of three major addresses he will deliver during his day in Brussels.

Biden will also announce a new set of American efforts to aid the Ukrainian people, said the senior White House aide.

Chief among them, the United States is ""prepared to provide more than $1 billion in new funding towards humanitarian assistance for those affected by Russia's war in Ukraine and its severe impacts around the world,"" said the official, without detailing how or when the money would be spent.

Biden will also announce a new commitment of funds to help protect global food security, which has been thrown into chaos by Russia's invasion because both Moscow and Kyiv are some of the world's largest exporters of grain.

Through the U.S. government's Feed the Future initiative, the Biden administration will provide $11 billion over the next five years to address threats to food security and prevent malnutrition, the official said.

The lion's share of Ukraine's grain exports currently go to Africa and Asia, and the American funds will be deployed to many of the countries where the population is especially vulnerable to a rise in food prices.",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/24/us-to-sanction-over-300-russian-elites-and-block-russian-central-bank-gold-.html

The news cites unnamed US Officials to hint that the announcements could come as soon as Thursday.

Also portraying the Ukraine-Russia tussles were the latest comments from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy who said, “Talks with Russia are difficult, at times confrontational.” Kyiv’s leader also adds, “100,000 people were living in the besieged city of Mariupol in inhuman conditions, without food, water or medicine.”

Furthermore, a leaders’ statement from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), shared by Nikkei, also highlight grim concerns. “The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has begun coordinating to express concern about cooperation between Russia and China in a joint statement to be finalized at the emergency summit on the 24th,” said the news.

Nikkei also mentioned, “If China supports Russia in military and economic terms, Russia's invasion of Ukraine will regain momentum, and the conflict with the United States and Europe may intensify.”

Welcome to The Daily 202! Tell your friends to sign up here. Via the Associated Press: On this day in 1933, the German Reichstag adopted the Enabling Act, effectively granting Adolf Hitler dictatorial powers. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The big idea Putin has escalated his efforts to smother dissent Since ordering the invasion of Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin has waged a domestic war on dissent that raises questions about whether he’s acting on authoritarian reflex or he actually harbors concerns about the firmness of what has been his stranglehold on power.

On Tuesday, the most prominent dissident voice against Putin, jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, was sentenced to nine more years in prison. His organizations were designated “extremist,” on a par with ISIS, meaning anyone who supports them could be incarcerated.

The new blow against Navalny — who now appears set to be imprisoned until Putin is in his late 70s — drew accusations of political manipulation from the West.

But the sentence was just the latest in a remarkable string of actions Putin has taken to silence dissent at home against his war in Ukraine, which has pulled thousands of Russians to protest in the streets and drawn overwhelming international condemnation abroad. Even China hasn’t endorsed Moscow’s actions.

Putin has:

In an escalation of his threats against domestic critics, Putin warned last week he would wipe out “scum and traitors” he accused of secretly working with the United States and its allies and undermining the war effort.

“Any people, and particularly the Russian people, will always be able to tell the patriots from the scum and traitors and spit them out like a midge that accidentally flew into their mouths,” Putin said. “I am convinced that this natural and necessary self-cleansing of society will only strengthen our country, our solidarity, cohesion and readiness to meet any challenge.”

Putin’s frustration has fed off the war inside Ukraine, which has not gone according to Moscow’s plan.

“Now Putin’s back is against the wall,” President Biden said Monday. “He wasn’t anticipating the extent or the strength of our unity. And the more his back is against the wall, the greater the severity of the tactics he may employ.”

Biden was talking about Russia’s tactics inside Ukraine. But one longtime student of Putin’s thinking told The Daily 202 that the former KGB officer worries — as he always has in his two decades in power — about popular or palace uprisings.

“He remains, as he should be now, very concerned about whether there will be a popular revolt,” former intelligence officer Angela Stent, the author of the prizewinning “Putin’s World: Russia Against the West and With the Rest,” said in an interview.

The answer to whether Putin is acting on authoritarian instinct or because he’s worried about fissures in his power is “yes.” You can’t separate one from the other.

“It’s an authoritarian instinct that’s been there all along. But it’s certainly been exacerbated. The war isn’t going well,” said Stent, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “He has to be concerned about the possibility of a palace coup.”

Two experiences shape Putin’s worldview.

He was a mid-level KGB officer in Dresden when the U.S.S.R. fell and East Germans surrounded the fearsome secret police’s headquarters there, forcing people inside to burn the files. “He’s afraid of the street,” Stent said.

And there was the 1996 St. Petersburg mayoral election in which the incumbent lost. Putin, then a deputy mayor, concluded “it’s not very good to have an election where you don’t know the outcome beforehand,” she said.

Officially, the White House isn’t offering a diagnosis of the Russian leader’s political health.

On Tuesday, Biden national security adviser Jake Sullivan sidestepped the question of whether Putin’s days in power are numbered. “From our perspective, what happens with respect to the Russian political system is something that will be worked out inside Russia,” Sullivan told reporters.

As GOP lawmakers push for more election fraud charges, prosecutors find few cases

“Across the country, officials are openly resisting calls from allies of former president Donald Trump for mass arrests of people they claim stole the presidential election for Joe Biden. In fact, in swing states targeted by Trump, officials have so far brought only a handful of fraud prosecutions,” Rosalind S. Helderman and Amy Gardner report.

What the numbers show: “There is no national tracking of voter fraud cases, and comprehensive surveys are difficult, given that cases are often undertaken by local prosecutors. But a Washington Post survey of attorneys general and large district attorney offices in the six swing states turned up just 39 cases of people charged with illegal activity related to the November 2020 election.”

The allegations: “Most were felons who are alleged to have registered to vote or cast ballots despite having lost the right to vote because of their criminal conviction. A few allegedly voted in the name of dead relatives.”

“The escalating warnings of a Russian cyberattack on the U.S. cut against one of the war’s most perplexing mysteries: Why has the Kremlin held back from unleashing its full hacking might against Ukraine?” Politico's Maggie Miller reports.

“Before Vladimir Putin launched his invasion a month ago, security experts warned that the coming conflict could redefine cyber warfare — both for Ukraine and for the United States. But so far, cyberattacks have been of limited importance in a war that Russia has waged using tanks, rockets, missiles and bombardments of civilians.”

Dissent is brewing in Russia

“In Russia, the slow going and the heavy toll of President Vladimir V. Putin’s war on Ukraine are setting off questions about his military’s planning capability, his confidence in his top spies and loyal defense minister, and the quality of the intelligence that reaches him. It also shows the pitfalls of Mr. Putin’s top-down governance, in which officials and military officers have little leeway to make their own decisions and adapt to developments in real time,” the New York Times's Anton Troianovski and Michael Schwirtz report.

“Biden, who during a videoconference Friday threatened President Xi Jinping with unspecified consequences should Beijing help Russia while it wages war in Ukraine, will discuss messaging on China during a North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit and also during a European Council meeting, [national security adviser Jake Sullivan] said Tuesday,” the WSJ’s Alex Leary reports.

A potential announcement expediting resettlement of some vulnerable Ukrainian refugees in U.S.

“The plan would allow vulnerable Ukrainians, specifically activists, journalists and those who are part of the LGBTQ community, to safely enter the U.S. at least temporarily. It would also expedite the reunification of Ukrainians with U.S.-based family members,” NBC News’s Julia Ainsley reports.

And beyond:

Biden promised billions for climate and equity initiatives. But that’s not his call.

“Biden’s inability to control how a large portion of the infrastructure money gets spent is largely due to legal constraints. About 75 percent of the infrastructure law will be distributed to states via a complicated formula set by existing statute, including the bulk of federal highway dollars,” Politico’s Zack Colman reports.

The president’s unappetizing options to tamp down gas prices

“Publicly, White House officials have said all options are on the table: a gasoline tax holiday or gas cards that would provide rebates to consumers; potential deals to remove sanctions on Iranian and Venezuelan crude exports; and possible relaxation of the Jones Act, a law requiring domestic cargo to be carried on American-made tankers using union labor,” Reuters’s Jarrett Renshaw reports.

But in private: “Officials say all the options are politically complicated and none of them may actually lower gas prices much, according to two sources familiar with the administration's thinking.”

Reuters/Ipsos poll: Biden’s approval rating drops to new low

“Biden's public approval rating fell to a new low of 40% this week, a clear warning sign for his Democratic Party as it seeks to retain control of Congress in the Nov. 8 election,” Reuters’s Andy Sullivan reports.

Some states are moving toward legalizing magic mushrooms

“For decades, psilocybin has been at the forefront of the movement to decriminalize psychedelic drugs. A growing body of research into the therapeutic potential of mushrooms and other psychedelics, particularly in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, and end-of-life distress, has helped destigmatize this class of drugs and bring them further into the scientific and cultural mainstream,” the Nation's Aída Chávez reports.

Striking a balance: “After more than 50 years of the War on Drugs, the politics of psychedelic reform are evolving at a remarkable speed, with many cities and states actively considering decriminalization or reform. But altered states of consciousness are no safe harbor from the pursuit of profit.”

Cruz, Hawley, Cotton and Blackburn are grilling Ketanji Brown Jackson. Are they running?

“In a Senate where committee meetings often go unattended and unnoticed, a Supreme Court hearing is still one of politicians’ biggest platforms. And the quartet of potential 2024 hopefuls knows it, all of them sitting together on a national stage more than a year before the presidential primaries begin,” Politico's Burgess Everett reports.

The lines of questioning: “Although most of the Republicans on the judicial panel considered future White House candidates warmly began questioning Jackson, they quickly descended into the usual antagonism that accompanies most questioning of a prospective Supreme Court justice by senators in the minority party.”

Today in Washington

Biden is scheduled to arrive in Brussels at 3:50 p.m. and meet with Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo at 4 p.m. (All times EST.)

HRC needs movie recommendations for isolation

Hillary Clinton announced via Twitter Tuesday that she has covid-19 but is “feeling fine.” (She said Bill is testing negative and quarantining elsewhere.) But Hillary wants to hear your movie recs. (White House press secretary Jen Psaki suggested the Netflix miniseries “Inventing Anna.”)

Bill tested negative and is feeling fine. He's quarantining until our household is fully in the clear. Movie recommendations appreciated! — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 22, 2022

Thanks for reading. See you tomorrow.
