Allegations against Russia regarding Bucha ‘ungrounded’: Russia’s UN ambassador

Russia’s ambassador to the UN Vassily Nebenzia in his remarks to Zelenskyy at the UN Security Council (UNSC) said Moscow places “on your conscience the ungrounded accusations against the Russian military, which are not confirmed by any eyewitnesses”.

Russia has claimed that images presented by Ukrainian authorities to show there had been a massacre in Bucha were fake, or that the deaths occurred after Russian soldiers pulled out of the areas.

“You only saw what they showed you. You couldn’t ignore the flagrant inconsistencies in the version of events which are being promoted by Ukrainian and Western media,” the ambassador told the UNSC.

Bucha killings can urge West to ‘do more’: Analyst

Melinda Haring of the Eurasia Center at the Atlantic Council told Al Jazeera that atrocities in Bucha are likely to persuade the West to take greater action against Russia.

“I think there is a lot of outrage. I think people are shocked. And this may motivate the West to actually do more,” she said from Washington, DC.

“So in Washington, there’s a lot of reluctance to send higher-end weapon systems. The White House is making this distinction between escalatory weapons and defensive weapons.”

“I think this distinction that might make sense in law school is going to go away and the US is going to finally start sending some of these weapons systems to the Ukrainians. On the justice side, I think it’s too early to say. Remember that Russia is on the Security Council, and it’s going to block every single attempt to bring justice to Ukraine,” Haring said.

He added there was “a long road ahead” in the UN’s effort to broker a ceasefire after what he described as a “frank” meeting with Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow on Monday.

“But it must be traveled, and … we will travel it,” Griffiths said, noting that he hoped to travel to Ukraine on Wednesday to hold discussions with officials there over a possible truce.

Griffiths also warned that “perilous conditions” were hampering the UN’s “efforts to access civilians” and called for non-combatants to be “allowed to move to safer areas without the fear of attacks.”

She said that claims that Ukrainian forces have used such weapons were also being investigated.

DiCarlo added that allegations of “conflict-related sexual violence perpetrated by Russian forces” had also emerged.

Ukraine’s president has accused Russian forces of committing the “most terrible war crimes” since World War II in his country.

Describing their alleged atrocities in Bucha, Zelenskyy said they had “killed entire families … and tried to burn the bodies”.

“There is not a single crime that they would not commit,” he said, adding he was speaking to the UNSC for the first time since Russia launched its invasion on behalf of the victims of Moscow’s troops.

He claimed civilians were shot in the town’s streets and in their own homes. He added others had been thrown into wells to die, or blown up by grenades. Some, Zelenskyy alleged, had been crushed by tanks “just for the pleasure” of the Russian soldiers.

UN chief says he will ‘never forget’ images of Bucha victims

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has told the UNSC he will “never forget” seeing images of dead civilians in Bucha, adding the war in Ukraine has led to a “senseless loss of life”.

Guterres said he was “equally shocked by the personal testimony of rapes and sexual violence” alleged to have been carried out by Russian forces that are now emerging.

He added that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine poses one of the greatest challenges ever to the international order “because of its nature, intensity, and consequences”.

Guterres said the war was heaping intense pressure on the developing world, with more than 1.2 billion people particularly vulnerable to spiking food, energy and fertiliser costs as a result of the conflict.

“We are already seeing some countries move from vulnerability into crisis,” he added.

Putin says possible nationalisation of Russian assets abroad is ‘a double-edged weapon’

President Vladimir Putin has said the possible nationalisation of Russian assets abroad is “a double-edged weapon” in a thinly-veiled warning that suggests Moscow may respond in kind to any such moves by foreign governments.

Putin’s remarks came a day after Germany said its energy regulator would take control of Gazprom Germania, a gas trading, storage and transmission business.

Russia’s state-owned energy giant Gazprom said last week that it was exiting the business in Germany amid a dispute between Moscow and Berlin over the Kremlin’s insistence that Russian gas exports must be paid for in roubles.

He added that the expulsions, which came after a wave of similar measures by other European nations, were also a response to “the terrible actions carried out in the past days in Ukraine, especially in Bucha.”

However, Albares said Spain would not expel the Russian ambassador, as Madrid wants to keep its own ambassador in Moscow and leave diplomatic channels open for talks with Russia to end the war.

Russia dismisses Ukrainian allegations of war crimes as ‘propaganda’

Russia has pushed back against allegations its soldiers have committed war crimes in Ukraine, casting such allegations as fake propaganda staged by Ukrainian special forces to besmirch Moscow.

Since Russian troops withdrew from towns and villages around the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, Ukrainian troops have been showing journalists corpses of what they say are civilians killed by Moscow’s forces.

“These are fakes that matured in the cynical imagination of Ukrainian propaganda,” Dmitry Medvedev, who served as president from 2008 to 2012 and is now deputy secretary of Russia’s Security Council, said on Telegram.

Meanwhile, Russia’s defence ministry said it had evidence that the 72nd Ukrainian Main Center for Psychological Operations had helped stage such propaganda in a village 23km (14 miles) northwest of Kyiv as well as in Sumy, Konotop, and other places.

“Soldiers of the 72nd Ukrainian Main Center for Psychological Operations conducted another staged filming of civilians allegedly killed by the violent actions of the Russian armed forces,” the ministry said. It gave no further details.

Low-level fighting is likely to continue in some of the recaptured areas, but taper off this week as the rest of the Russian forces withdraw, the ministry said in its latest intelligence update.

“Many Russian units withdrawing from northern Ukraine are likely to require significant re-equipping and refurbishment before being available to redeploy for operations in eastern Ukraine.”

Japan’s foreign minister has returned from Poland with 20 Ukrainian refugees.

“The government of Japan is committed to provide the maximum support to these 20 Ukrainians,” Hayashi told reporters in Poland shortly before he set off for Tokyo with the refugees.

US stops Russian bond payments

The US has stopped the Russian government from paying holders of its sovereign debt more than $600m from reserves held at American banks, a move meant to ratchet up pressure on Moscow and eat into its dollar holdings.

Under the sanctions on Russia, its central bank’s foreign currency reserves at US financial institutions were frozen but the US Department of Treasury had been allowing the use of those funds to make coupon payments on dollar-denominated sovereign debt.

On Monday, the largest payments came due – including a $552.4m principal payment on a maturing bond – and the US decided to cut off access to the funds, to force Moscow to decide whether it will use what dollars it does have to pay its debt or for other purposes, like its war effort, a spokesperson said.

Why Biden’s release of US oil reserves won’t end pain at the pump

When Biden announced that the US would release more than 180 million barrels of oil from its strategic petroleum reserve over the next six months, he hailed it as a historic move that would lower fuel prices in the US.

The price at the pump has surged amid Russia’s war on Ukraine, which has led the US and other nations to bar oil and gas imports from Moscow and driven concerns over global energy supplies with inventories low and new production capacity limited.

But while the Ukraine conflict pushes Biden and other world leaders to dip into their stockpiles, experts say the actual effect for consumers will be limited – and higher prices and more disruptions lie ahead.

EU proposes ban on Russian coal imports

The European Union’s executive branch has proposed a ban on coal imports from Russia in what would be the first sanctions targeting the country’s lucrative energy industry over its offensive in Ukraine.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that the EU needed to increase the pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin after what she described as the “heinous crimes” carried out around Kiev.

Von der Leyen said the ban on coal imports is worth $4.4 billion (4 billion euros) per year. She added that the EU has already started working on additional sanctions, including on oil imports.

Russia is waging a cruel, ruthless war, also against Ukraine’s civilian population.

Putin ally says Bucha killings are fake propaganda

One of Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin's closest allies has said that claims that Russian forces executed civilians in Bucha were fake products of Ukrainian and Western propaganda aimed at discrediting Russia.

""These are fakes that matured in the cynical imagination of Ukrainian propaganda,"" Dmitry Medvedev, who served as president from 2008 to 2012 and is now deputy secretary of Russia's Security Council, said.

""They were concocted for vast amounts of money,"" Medevedev said.

Britain says Ukraine forces have retaken the north

Ukrainian forces have retaken key northern terrain, forcing Russian forces to retreat from areas around the city of Chernihiv and north of the capital Kiev, British military intelligence said.

Low-level fighting is likely to continue in some of there captured areas, but reduce this week as the remainder of the Russian forces withdraw, the defence ministry said.

German president admits mistakes with Russia

Germany’s president has admitted mistakes in policy toward Russia in his previous job as foreign minister.

President Frank-Walter Steinmeier served twice as ex-Chancellor Angela Merkel’s foreign minister, most recently from 2013 to 2017, and before that as ex-Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder’s chief of staff.

In that time, Germany pursued dialogue with Russian President Vladimir Putin and cultivated close energy ties.

Ukraine: Situation in Mariupol much worse than Bucha

Ukraine has said that what happened in the city of Bucha is just the ""tip of the iceberg” and the situation in Mariupol is much worse.

""Ukraine won the battle for Kiev, but the war goes on,"" Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has said at a joint news conference in Warsaw with his British counterpart Liz Truss.

Noting that his country is preparing for a new large-scale offensive by Russia in eastern Ukraine, Kuleba said Russian forces will try to capture more territories in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions and will also try to take control of the city of Mariupol.

Russia urged not to use land mines

A top official in the global campaign against the use of land mines has urged Russia to halt the use in Ukraine of these weapons that too often kill and maim civilians.

Alicia Arango Olmos, Colombia’s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva and this year’s president of the state parties to the 1997 convention banning the production and use of land mines, expressed deep concern at media reports that Russia is using land mines in its attack in Ukraine.

She pointed to Human Rights Watch which said on March 29 that Ukrainian explosive ordnance disposal technician located banned ant-personnel mines in the eastern Kharkiv region a day earlier.

Zelenskyy to address UNSC

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will address the UN Security Council for the first time at a meeting on Tuesday that is certain to focus on what appear to be deliberate killings allegedly by the Russian forces in the town of Bucha on the outskirts of the capital Kiev.

The discovery after the withdrawal of Russian troops has sparked global outrage and vehement denials from the Russian government.

The United Kingdom holds the council presidency this month and announced that the Ukrainian leader will speak at the open meeting.

'No place for Russia on UN Human Rights Council'

Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has said he spoke with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres about events in Bucha in what appear to be deliberate killings in the town on the outskirts of the capital Kiev.

""No place for Russia on the UN Human Rights Council,"" Kuleba said on Twitter. ""Ukraine will use all available UN mechanisms to collect evidence and hold Russian war criminals to account.""

Videos and photos of streets in Bucha strewn with corpses of what appeared to be civilians, some with their hands tied behind their back, have led to global revulsion, calls for tougher sanctions, and Russia's suspension from the UN's premier human rights body, the Human Rights Council.

Russian ambassador to the UN claims Ukraine 'staged' Bucha atrocities

Russia is not responsible for the atrocities that Ukraine claims occurred in Bucha, the Russian Ambassador to the United Nations claimed in a press conference on Monday.

Ambassador Vasily Alekseevich Nebenzya claimed that experts who analyzed the video showing dead bodies on the street in Bucha and concluded the scene was staged, alleging that the people lying on the street showed signs of life and that it was clear the first stages of decomposition, which would have occurred in the days after Russian military forces had withdrawn, have not taken place.

To back his claims, Nebenzya played a video, purportedly filmed on Saturday after Russian forces left Bucha, and pointed out that there were no dead bodies on the streets.

Nebenzya also alleged that the Ukrainian military interviewed people in different locations throughout Bucha and there was no mention of a civilian massacre.

""Now the nationalists have a pretext to commit a real massacre"" Nebenzya said, claiming Ukraine would use Bucha as a false flag operation. ""We want the world to stay alert.""

Nebenzya added that the ""truth of what happened in Bucha will reveal itself"" and that he will present ""even more"" evidence to the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday.

US pushes to expel Russian diplomats from UN Human Rights Council

The U.S., in coordination with Ukraine and European allies, is pushing to expel Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield announced Monday.

The U.N. Human Rights Council is a body within the U.N. system where countries are elected for three-year terms. To suspend one of the body's 47 elected members requires a two-thirds majority in the U.N.'s main body -- the U.N. General Assembly.

During a press conference in Romania, Thomas-Greenfield told reporters the U.S. wants to have a vote this week.

""We cannot let a member state that is subverting every principle we hold dear to continue to sit on the U.N. Human Rights Council,"" she said. ""Russia should not have a position of authority in that body, nor should we allow Russia to use their role on the Council as a tool of propaganda to suggest they have a legitimate concern about human rights.""

Thomas-Greenfield called Moscow's participation a ""farce"" and added it ""hurts the credibility of the Council and the U.N. writ large -- and it is simply wrong.""

It is unclear whether the U.S. and its allies and partners have the votes to take this rare step, but two previous U.N. General Assembly votes condemning Russia's invasion have yielded 141 and 140 votes -- crossing the two-thirds threshold of the U.N.'s 193 member states.

Whether they can secure that same level of support for an expulsion, which some countries may see as an escalation, is an open question.

This would not be the first time the U.N. has suspended a country. In March 2011, it to suspend Libya from the Council because of Muammar Gaddafi's violence against protesters.

State Department spokesperson Ned Price indicated they believe they have the votes, saying the U.S. believes the General Assembly will ""stand up in clear contravention of what Russia is doing.""

""It's something that we'll continue to discuss,"" Price said. ""But, as we've heard, there's been widespread, strong condemnation of this conduct and this would be the next natural step.""

The U.N. Security Council will meet Tuesday to discuss Ukraine, with the atrocities reported out of Bucha and other Kyiv suburbs on the agenda.

""We will be prepared to confront them with the actual truth,"" Thomas-Greenfield said Monday when asked about that meeting. ""They of course will, as they always do, try to distract us with their lies, and we're prepared for that.""

US supports team of independent war crimes investigators

The United States is supporting a multinational team of independent war crimes investigators, including American experts, that are working with Ukraine's prosecutor-general on a probe of alleged Russian war crimes, U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said on Monday.

The team is working in Eastern Europe, but not in Ukraine itself, Price said. He said the team is collecting, preserving and analyzing evidence with a view toward prosecutions and other forms of holding Russia accountable, Price said.

The United States is also supporting the effort through funding for non-government organizations that are part of the effort, Price said. He said he could not provide further details, including how many Americans are involved or how much funding is being allocated.

At the start of his briefing on Monday, Price noted the horrific reports from Bucha, Ukraine, and other towns outside of the capital of Kyiv, describing reports of ""civilians, many with their hands tied, apparently executed in the streets, others in mass graves.""

""We are seeing credible reports of torture, rape and civilians executed alongside their families,"" Price said. ""There are reports and images of a nightmare litany of atrocities, including reports of land mines and booby traps left behind by Putin's forces to injure even more civilians and slow the stabilization and recovery of devastated communities after they failed in their objective and withdrew.""

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will discuss the reported atrocities with his NATO foreign minister counterparts during the Western military alliance's spring meeting this week, Price said.

President Joe Biden said earlier Monday that he is calling for more sanctions to be imposed on Russia in light of the reports from Bucha.

""We're continuously tightening sanctions and preparing for additional sanctions, jointly with our allies and partners,"" Price said.

Nearly 70% of Russian troops near Kyiv have withdrawn: US official

About two-thirds of the Russian forces that were arrayed against the capital of Ukraine have withdrawn toward Belarus, according to a senior U.S. defense official.

The number of Russian forces being pulled back from Kyiv is up from an estimated 20% late last week, the official said.

Russian Deputy Defense Minister Col. Gen. Alexander Fomin told reporters last week that Russia's military activity was being dramatically curtailed near Kyiv and in Chernihiv in northern Ukraine in an attempt to increase ""mutual trust and create conditions required"" for further peace talks with Ukrainian negotiators.

The United States has been skeptical of Russia's promise to scale back its military activity near Kyiv.

Before repositioning its forces, Russia had close to 20 battalion tactical groups (BTGs) bearing down on Kyiv from the north and northwest, with each group comprised of 700 to 900 troops. Roughly 13 of those BTGs are now either in Belarus or on their way there.

The Pentagon believes the withdrawing forces will be resupplied and possibly reinforced in the north before heading back into Ukraine to fight elsewhere, the official said.

""Our best assessment –- and it is only an assessment -– is that they will be applied in the eastern part of the country in the Donbas region,"" the official said of the two separatist areas, Donetsk and Luhansk, in eastern Ukraine that Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized as independent self-proclaimed people's republics prior to the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.

The United States has also seen some Russian troops leave the city of Sumy in northeast Ukraine and head north to the Russian border, according to the official.

Despite these movements, the official said the ""vast majority"" of the more than 125 BTGs that Russia committed to the invasion remain inside Ukraine.

Germany to expel a 'significant' number of Russian diplomats

Germany's foreign minister said Monday that her country is moving to expel a ""significant"" number of Russian diplomats following reports that Russian troops killed more than 400 civilians in the Ukraine city of Bucha.

""The pictures from Bucha bear witness to the unbelievable brutality of the Russian leadership and of those who follow its propaganda, to a will to annihilate that transcends all borders. We have to fear similar pictures from many other places that Russian troops have occupied in Ukraine,"" Germany's Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said in a statement.

Baerbock added that Germany is opposed to the inhumanity alleged in Bucha and must stand for freedom and be prepared to defend it. Baerbock said Germany, therefore, has decided to declare a significant number of the Russian diplomats persona non grata.

She said the Russian ambassador to Germany was informed of the decision on Monday afternoon.

Germany will also take further action against Russia together with allies, tightening existing sanctions, increasing support for Ukraine's armed forces and strengthening the NATO eastern flank.

The statement and corresponding tweet from Baerbock does not say how many diplomats will be expelled.

Biden to call for more sanctions against Russia over Bucha 'war crimes'

President Joe Biden said on Monday that he is seeking more sanctions against Russia after horrific images surfaced of dead civilians lying in the bombed-out streets of Bucha, Ukraine.

Upon his return to Washington from Ft. McNair, Biden said he will call for more sanctions but stopped short of accusing Russia of committing genocide in Ukraine.

""I'm seeking more sanctions, yes,"" Biden said, declining to offer specifics when pressed.

Biden described the situation in Bucha as ""outrageous"" and called Russian President Vladimir Putin ""brutal.""

""You may remember I got criticized for calling Putin a war criminal. Well, the truth of the matter -- you saw what happened in Bucha,"" Biden said. ""This warrants he is a war criminal. But we have to gather the information. We have to continue to provide Ukraine with weapons they need to continue the fight. And we have to gather all the details. So this could be an actual -- have a war-crime trial. This guy is brutal. And what's happening with Bucha is outrageous. And everyone sees it.""

Ukrainian officials accused Russian troops of committing genocide in Bucha, which was retaken by Ukrainian forces in recent days. Ukrainian leaders said 410 civilians were killed in the fighting in Bucha and that many were found with their hands bound and shot at close range.

Asked if he thought Russia was committing genocide, Biden replied, ""No, I think it is a war crime.""

Russia may launch major offensive in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region

The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said Monday it is monitoring large movements of Russian troops and reinforcements in eastern Ukraine.

The General Staff said it expects Russian forces to launch a possibly major offensive in the Donbas region within the next 24 hours, particularly against the city of Severodonetsk, which is the administrative center of the government-controlled areas of the Luhansk Oblast.

Meanwhile, Donetsk Oblast Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko has urged civilians to evacuate now, even from areas not close to the front lines.

Prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced his recognition of two breakaway areas of eastern Ukraine's Donbas region that share a border with Russia -- the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics. Russia-backed separatist forces have controlled these parts of Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhanks oblasts since 2014.

Russia accuses Ukraine of 'fake attack' in Bucha

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has accused Ukrainian forces of staging an attack in Bucha, northwest of Kyiv, where images have emerged showing bodies in civilian clothes lying in the streets and in mass graves.

""The other day, another fake attack was launched in the city of Bucha, Kyiv region, after Russian military personnel left from there in accordance with the plans and agreements reached,"" Lavrov told reporters in Moscow on Monday. ""A few days later, a staging was arranged there, which was dispersed through all channels and social networks by Ukrainian representatives and their Western patrons.""

According to Lavrov, Russian forces vacated the area on March 30.

“On March 31, the mayor [of Bucha] solemnly said that everything was fine there,"" he added. ""And two days later, we saw how the same production was organized on the streets, which they are now trying to use for anti-Russian purposes.""

Kremlin reacts to images of dead bodies in Bucha

Russia responded on Monday to accusations that its troops have deliberately killed civilians in Ukraine, after images emerged showing bodies in civilian clothes scattered in areas on the outskirts of the capital that were recently recaptured from Russian forces.

Ukrainian Prosecutor General Iryna Venedyktova said Sunday that 410 civilians were found dead in towns near Kyiv.

During a daily press briefing on Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia ""categorically dismiss[es] any accusations"" of its role in civilian killings and that Moscow does not trust the evidence in Bucha.

""This information should be seriously doubted,"" Peskov told reporters. ""From what we have seen, the video materials cannot be trusted to a large extent, as our specialists from the Defense Ministry have detected signs of video forgery and other kinds of fakes.""

The Kremlin demands that ""international leaders do not jump to conclusions, do not make hasty unsupported accusations but at least seek information from various sources and at least listen to our arguments,"" Peskov said.

""The facts, the chronology of events also do not speak in favor of the credibility of these claims,"" he added.

Russia will reiterate its calls to discuss the matter at the United Nations Security Council on Monday, according to Peskov.

""We believe that the issue should be discussed at the highest level, so we have proposed that it be discussed at the Security Council. We are aware that the initiative has been blocked,"" he said. ""Our diplomats will continue active efforts towards putting this item on the Security Council's agenda. This issue is too serious.""

""The initiative aimed to put the item on the Security Council agenda demonstrates that Russia wants and actually demands its discussion at the international level,"" he added.

""Concentrated evil has come to our land. Murderers. Torturers. Rapists. Looters. Who call themselves the army. And who deserve only death after what they did.""

""I want every mother of every Russian soldier to see the bodies of the killed people in Bucha, in Irpin, in Hostomel. What did they do? Why were they killed? What did the man who was riding his bicycle down the street do? Why were ordinary civilians in an ordinary peaceful city tortured to death? Why were women strangled after their earrings were ripped out of their ears? How could women be raped and killed in front of children? How could their corpses be desecrated even after death? Why did they crush the bodies of people with tanks? What did the Ukrainian city of Bucha do to your Russia? How did all this become possible?""

""All partners of Ukraine will be informed in detail about what happened in the temporarily occupied territory of our state. War crimes in Bucha and other cities during the Russian occupation will also be considered by the UN Security Council on Tuesday.""

Zelenslyy also invited former German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy to Ukraine to witness the carnage.

""We do not blame the West. We do not blame anyone but the specific Russian military who did this against our people,"" Zelenskyy, who has pleaded with the U.S. and NATO allies to create a no-fly zone over Ukraine, a measure so far, that President Joe Biden and other Western leaders have refused to do, said.

At least 3,376 people have been evacuated during the day on Monday from the towns of Mariupol and Berdyansk, from southeastern Ukraine to the Zaporizhia region, controlled by Ukrainian forces.

“405 people have traveled to Zaporiya by their own means from Mariupol and Berdyansk. 1,553 of them came from Mariupol. 805 people also came from other cities in the Zaporizhia region: Polohy, Vasylivka, Berdyansk, Melitopol”Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories Irina Vereshchuk celebrated in a Facebook post.

Likewise, a convoy of seven buses that has evacuated people from Mariúpol and that was traveling along the agreed route, accompanied by a delegation from the International Committee of the Red Cross, has been blocked in the town of Mangush, in the province of Donetsk.

In this context, in the Luhansk region, 971 people have been evacuated from the cities of Lisichansk, Severodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna and Horske.

“Despite the agreement, the Russian occupiers systematically violated the agreements during the evacuation in the Lugansk region. We are negotiating and, despite the resistance of the Russian Federation in the work of humanitarian corridors, we will not stop trying to save our people”Vereshchuk has sentenced.

Meanwhile, the president of Ukraine, Volodimir Zelensky has accused Russia of “distorting the facts” in the context of the Bucha massacre and has assured that “they will not be able to deceive the whole world”as there is “ample evidence” that Russian troops destroy cities and kidnap, torture and kill civilians.

“The time will come when all Russians will learn the whole truth about which of their fellow citizens they killed. Who gave orders. Who turned a blind eye to the murders”has highlighted in his usual evening speech, according to the official website of the Ukrainian Presidency.

Zelensky recalled that there are more than 300 people “murdered and tortured” in the city of Bucha, a number that, according to the Ukrainian president, “could be larger” when the entire city is thoroughly reviewed. “And this is just one city,” he added.

In this sense, he has said that Moscow “is already launching a false campaign to hide its guilt in the mass murders of civilians in Mariupol”, so “they will try to hide the traces of their crimes”, something they have not done when they have withdrawn from Bucha.

“They will do dozens of on-stage interviews, re-edit recordings, and specifically kill people to make it look like they were killed by someone else.”he pointed out, adding that “everything possible is being done to identify the Russian military involved in these crimes.”
