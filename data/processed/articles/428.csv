In Jackson, Biden delivers on a campaign promise to make the historic appointment and to further diversify a court that was made up entirely of white men for almost two centuries. He has chosen an attorney who would be the high court’s first former public defender, though she also possesses the elite legal background of other justices.

Jackson would be the current court’s second Black justice — Justice Clarence Thomas, a conservative, is the other — and just the third in history.

The news was confirmed by a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss it before the president’s official announcement later today.

She would also be only the sixth woman to serve on the court, and her confirmation would mean that for the first time four women would sit together on the nine-member court.

The current court includes three women, one of whom is the court’s first Latina, Justice Sonia Sotomayor.

Jackson would join the liberal minority of a conservative-dominated court that is weighing cutbacks to abortion rights and will be considering ending affirmative action in college admissions and restricting voting rights efforts to increase minority representation.

Biden is filling the seat that will be vacated by Justice Stephen Breyer, 83, who is retiring at the end of the term this summer.

Jackson, 51, once worked as one of Breyer’s law clerks early in her legal career. She attended Harvard as an undergraduate and for law school, and served on the US Sentencing Commission, the agency that develops federal sentencing policy, before becoming a federal judge in 2013.

Her nomination is subject to confirmation by the Senate, where Democrats hold the majority by a razor-thin 50-50 margin with Vice President Kamala Harris as the tie-breaker. Party leaders have promised swift but deliberate consideration of the president’s nominee.

The next justice will replace one of the more liberal justices, so she would not tip the balance of the court, which now leans 6-3 in favor of conservatives.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-february-25-2022/

Moscow said it had captured the Hostomel airfield northwest of the capital - a potential staging post for an assault on Kyiv that has been fought over since Russian paratroopers landed there in the first hours of the war. This could not be confirmed and the Ukrainian authorities reported heavy fighting there.

""Shots and explosions are ringing out in some neighbourhoods. Saboteurs have already entered Kyiv,"" said the mayor of the city of 3 million, former world heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko. ""The enemy wants to put the capital on its knees and destroy us.""

After weeks of warnings from Western leaders, Russian President Vladimir Putin unleashed a three-pronged invasion of Ukraine from the north, east and south before dawn on Thursday, in the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two.

Amid the chaos of war, a picture of what was happening on the ground was slow to emerge.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy tweeted that there had been heavy fighting with people killed at the entrance to the eastern cities of Chernihiv and Melitopol, as well as at Hostomel.

Witnesses said loud explosions and gunfire could also be heard near the airport in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second city, close to Russia's border, and air raid sirens sounded over Lviv in the west. Authorities reported heavy fighting in the eastern city of Sumy.

Britain's defence ministry said in an intelligence update that Russian armoured forces had opened a new route of advance towards the capital after failing to take Chernihiv, and most troops remained more than 50 km (30 miles) from Kyiv's city centre.

Ukraine said more than 1,000 Russian soldiers had been killed so far. Russia did not release casualty figures. The United Nations said 25 civilians had been killed and 102 wounded, figures that were likely to be a ""significant under-estimate"". None of the tolls could be independently verified.

SIRENS WAIL, AGAIN

Air raid sirens wailed over Kyiv for a second day, and some residents sheltered in underground metro stations.

Windows were blasted out of a 10-storey apartment block near the main airport. A two-metre crater showed where a shell had struck before dawn.

""How can we be living through this in our time? Putin should burn in hell along with his whole family,"" said Oxana Gulenko, sweeping broken glass from her room.

Hundreds crowded into a cramped bomb shelter beneath one building after a televised warning of air strikes.

""How can you wage a war against peaceful people?"" said Viktoria, 35, as her children aged 5 and 7 slept in their winter coats.

Alla, 40, said: ""The kids were scared, they were crying and asking 'Mom, will we all die?'.""

Thousands of people crowded Kyiv's railway station trying to force their way onto packed trains evacuating people westward to Lviv. When a train arrived, people rushed the doors, some screamed, and guards fired blanks to scare the crowd away.

Maria, 30, had been there since the morning with her child, husband and dog, trying and failing to board the trains.

""It's dangerous to break through the crowd with a kid. The dog is scared. Honestly, we're exhausted,"" she said.

But when a squad of soldiers marched through the station, people clapped and shouted the national military cry of ""Glory to Ukraine!"". The soldiers shouted back the traditional response: ""Glory to the heroes!""

Ukrainians were circulating an unverified recording on Friday of a Russian warship ordering a Ukrainian outpost on the tiny Black Sea island of Zmiinyi (Snake Island) to surrender.

The Ukrainians reply: ""Russian warship, go fuck yourself."" Zelenskiy said the 13 guards had been killed by a Russian strike and would receive posthumous honours.

'NUMBER ONE TARGET'

Envoys of the EU's 27 member states agreed to freeze any assets in the EU belonging to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, adding to a slew of sanctions backed by the leaders at an emergency summit on Thursday night.

Numerous Western countries have announced new sanctions on Russia, including blacklisting its banks and banning technology imports. But they have so far stopped short of forcing it out of the SWIFT system for international bank payments, drawing criticism from Kyiv which says there is no reason to hold back.

U.S. officials believe Russia's initial aim is to ""decapitate"" Zelenskiy's government. Zelenskiy said he knew he was ""the number one target"" but would stay in Kyiv.

An adviser to Zelenskiy said Ukraine was prepared for talks with Russia, including on staying neutral, one of Moscow's pre-war demands. The Kremlin said it had offered talks in the Belarusian capital Minsk, but that Ukraine had proposed Warsaw instead and there was now a ""pause"" in contacts.

Putin says Ukraine is an illegitimate state carved out of Russia, a view Ukrainians see as aimed at erasing their more than thousand-year history.

He says he does not plan a military occupation, only to disarm Ukraine and remove its leaders. But it is not clear how a pro-Russian leader could be installed unless troops control much of the country.

U.N. agencies said as many as 5 million people could try to flee abroad. Ukraine has banned men of fighting age from leaving, and at borders with Poland, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia, those crossing were mostly women and children.

Women cried as they bade goodbye to male loved ones and crossed into Romania.

Ukraine, a democratic nation of 44 million people, voted overwhelmingly for independence at the fall of the Soviet Union and hopes to join NATO and the EU - aspirations that infuriate Moscow.

Russia is one of the world's biggest energy producers and Europe's biggest gas supplier, and both it and Ukraine are among the top exporters of grain. War and sanctions will disrupt economies around the world.

Zelenskyy calls on EU to 'do more' after member states refuse to fast-track Ukraine's application to be a member

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivering a video address that was released on March 11, 2022. Volodymyr Zelenskyy

In a Friday video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy slammed European Union leaders for refusing to fast-track Ukraine's application to join the bloc and called on them to ""do more.""

Leaders of the 27 EU member states met in Versailles, France, on Thursday, and ultimately concluded that the bloc would not speed up Ukraine's application.

Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland were in favor, while France, Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands were not, The Guardian reported. Accession to the EU typically takes multiple years.

Zelenskyy said on Friday: ""A very important meeting of the leaders of the European Union took place yesterday ... We know what was said at this meeting. What all leaders said. Who specifically spoke. Who supported. Who remained silent.""

""How do we evaluate the decision made? It's very simple: it must be stronger. This is not what we expect.""

He said: ""The European Union must do more. It must do more for us, for Ukraine. And for itself.""

Notably, Zelenskyy could be seen outdoors in the video. Most of his video addresses were filmed indoors amid multiple reports suggesting he was the target of assassination attempts.

The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Addressing a virtual meeting of NATO leaders, Johnson said his government will personally sanction the Russian leaders over their ""revanchist mission"" to overturn the post-Cold War order. He also called for ""immediate action"" to ban Russia from the SWIFT payment platform to ""inflict maximum pain"" on the Russian regime.

""The Prime Minister urged leaders to take immediate action against SWIFT to inflict maximum pain on President Putin and his regime.

Ukrainian forces put up fierce resistance to slow the advance of the larger and more powerful Russian military closing in on the capital, as the U.S. and European Union rushed ammunition and weapons to Kyiv and announced powerful new financial sanctions aimed at further isolating Moscow.

Huge explosions lit up the predawn sky south of Kyiv early Sunday. President Volodymyr Zelensky's office said one of the blasts was near the Zhuliany airport. The mayor of Vasylkiv, about 40 kilometres south of the capital, said an oil depot was hit.

Zelensky's office also said Russian forces blew up a gas pipeline in Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city. The government warned that smoke from the huge explosion could cause an ""environmental catastrophe"" and advised people to cover their windows with damp cloth or gauze.

""We will fight for as long as needed to liberate our country,"" Zelensky vowed.

Terrified men, women and children sought safety inside and underground, and the government maintained a 39-hour curfew to keep people off the streets. More than 150,000 Ukrainians fled for Poland, Moldova and other neighbouring countries, and the United Nations warned the number could grow to four million if fighting escalates.

Russian President Vladimir Putin hasn't disclosed his ultimate plans, but Western officials believe he is determined to overthrow Ukraine's government and replace it with a regime of his own, redrawing the map of Europe and reviving Moscow's Cold War-era influence.

To aid Ukraine's ability to hold out, the U.S. pledged an additional $350 million US in military assistance to Ukraine, including anti-tank weapons, body armour and small arms. Germany said it would send missiles and anti-tank weapons to the besieged country and that it would close its airspace to Russian planes.

The Canadian government said it will match Canadians' donations to the Red Cross in aid of Ukraine, up to a maximum of $10 million Cdn. Ottawa said the matching donations are in addition to the $50 million in funding given to Ukraine for development and humanitarian aid, and the recently announced $620 million in sovereign loans that Canada has extended to Ukraine.

On Saturday, Canada, the U.S. and other allies agreed to block ""selected"" Russian banks from the SWIFT global financial messaging system, which moves money around more than 11,000 banks and other financial institutions worldwide, part of a new round of sanctions aiming to impose a severe cost on Moscow for the invasion. They also agreed to impose ""restrictive measures"" on Russia's central bank.

It was unclear how much territory Russian forces had seized or to what extent their advance had been stalled. Britain's Ministry of Defence said ""the speed of the Russian advance has temporarily slowed likely as a result of acute logistical difficulties and strong Ukrainian resistance.""

A senior U.S. defence official said more than half the Russian combat power that was massed along Ukraine's borders has entered the country and Moscow has had to commit more fuel supply and other support units inside Ukraine than originally anticipated. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal U.S. assessments.

The curfew forcing everyone in Kyiv inside was set to last through Monday morning. The relative quiet of the capital was sporadically broken by gunfire.

Fighting on the city's outskirts suggested that small Russian units were trying to clear a path for the main forces. Small groups of Russian troops were reported inside Kyiv, but Britain and the U.S. said the bulk of the forces were 30 kilometres from the city's centre as of the afternoon.

Russia claims its assault on Ukraine from the north, east and south is aimed only at military targets, but bridges, schools and residential neighbourhoods have been hit.

Ukraine's health minister reported Saturday that 198 people, including three children, had been killed and more than 1,000 others wounded during Europe's largest land war since the Second World War. It was unclear whether those figures included both military and civilian casualties.

A missile struck a highrise apartment building in Kyiv's southwestern outskirts near one of the city's two passenger airports, leaving a jagged hole of ravaged apartments over several floors. A rescue worker said six civilians were injured.

Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, said troops in Kyiv were fighting Russian ""sabotage groups."" Ukraine says some 200 Russian soldiers have been captured and thousands killed.

Markarova said Ukraine was gathering evidence of shelling of residential areas, kindergartens and hospitals to submit to The Hague as possible crimes against humanity.

Zelensky reiterated his openness to talks with Russia in a video message, saying he welcomed an offer from Turkey and Azerbaijan to organize diplomatic efforts, which so far have faltered.

The Kremlin confirmed a phone call between Putin and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev but gave no hint of restarting talks. A day earlier, Zelensky offered to negotiate a key Russian demand: abandoning ambitions of joining NATO.

Putin sent troops into Ukraine after denying for weeks that he intended to do so, all the while building up a force of almost 200,000 troops along the countries' borders. He claims the West has failed to take seriously Russia's security concerns about NATO, the Western military alliance that Ukraine aspires to join. But he has also expressed scorn about Ukraine's right to exist as an independent state.

Great costs on both sides

The effort was already coming at great cost to Ukraine, and apparently to Russian forces as well.

Ukraine's Infrastructure Ministry said a Russian missile was shot down before dawn Saturday as it headed for the dam of the sprawling reservoir that serves Kyiv. The government also said a Russian convoy was destroyed. Video images showed soldiers inspecting burned-out vehicles after Ukraine's 101st brigade reported destroying a column of two light vehicles, two trucks and a tank. The claim could not be verified.

Highways into Kyiv from the east were dotted with checkpoints manned by Ukrainian troops and young men in civilian clothes carrying automatic rifles. Low-flying planes patrolled the skies, though it was unclear if they were Russian or Ukrainian.

In addition to Kyiv, the Russian assault appeared to focus on Ukraine's economically vital coastal areas, from near the Black Sea port of Odesa in the west to beyond the Azov Sea port of Mariupol in the east.

Ukrainian soldiers in Mariupol guarded bridges and blocked people from the shoreline amid concerns the Russian navy could launch an assault from the sea.

""I don't care anymore who wins and who doesn't,"" said Ruzanna Zubenko, whose large family was forced from their home outside Mariupol after it was badly damaged by shelling. ""The only important thing is for our children to be able to grow up smiling and not crying.""

PHOTOS | Protests in support of Ukraine around the world:

Fighting also raged in two eastern territories controlled by pro-Russia separatists. Authorities in Donetsk said hot water supplies to the city of about 900,000 were suspended because of damage to the system by Ukrainian shelling.

The U.S. government urged Zelensky early Saturday to evacuate Kyiv but he turned down the offer, according to a senior American intelligence official with direct knowledge of the conversation. Zelensky issued a defiant video recorded on a downtown street, saying he remained in the city.

""We aren't going to lay down weapons. We will protect the country,"" he said. ""Our weapon is our truth, and our truth is that it's our land, our country, our children. And we will defend all of that.""

Refugees arrive in Hungary, Poland

Hungary and Poland both opened their borders to Ukrainians.

Refugees arriving in the Hungarian border town of Zahony said men between the ages of 18 and 60 were not being allowed to leave Ukraine.

""My son was not allowed to come. My heart is so sore, I'm shaking,"" said Vilma Sugar, 68.

'Binoculars and gunsights'

Officials in Kyiv urged residents to stay away from windows to avoid debris or bullets. Many hunkered down in basements, underground garages and subway stations, where families, some with pets, camped out on hard floors.

Shelves were sparsely stocked at grocery stores and pharmacies, and people worried how long food and medicine supplies might last.

The U.S. and its allies have beefed up forces on NATO's eastern flank but so far have ruled out deploying troops to fight Russia. Instead, the U.S., the European Union and other countries have slapped wide-ranging sanctions on Russia, freezing the assets of businesses and individuals including Putin and his foreign minister.

Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council, warned that Moscow could react by opting out of the last remaining nuclear arms pact, freezing Western assets and cutting diplomatic ties.

""There is no particular need in maintaining diplomatic relations,"" Medvedev said. ""We may look at each other in binoculars and gunsights.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ukraine-russia-attack-feb26-2022-1.6365758
