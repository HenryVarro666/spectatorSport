Biden signed the aid into law this week.

He said drones would be part of the package, “which demonstrates our commitment to sending our most cutting-edge systems to Ukraine for its defense.”

According to Politico, Texas Rep. Mike McCaul – the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee – said the U.S. is expected to send 100 Switchblade drones to Ukraine. U.S.-based AeroVironment manufacturer makes two models of the Switchblade, the 300 and the 600.

“Switchblade 300 delivers increased warfighter lethality with real-time GPS coordinates and video for precise targeting with low collateral effects,” said AeroVironment.

“Switchblade 600 represents the next generation of extended-range loitering missiles,” the manufacturer said of the other model.

NBC News described the “killer drones” as “explosives-laden” smart bombs. While the 300 is designed for pinpoint strikes on personnel, the larger 600 is meant to destroy tanks and other armored vehicles, said the outlet.

“They can be programmed to automatically strike targets miles away, and they can be steered around objectives until the time is right to strike,” said NBC News.

Biden said the U.S. is “going to provide unprecedented assistance to Ukraine,” including 800 antiaircraft systems and, at the request of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, is helping the country obtain longer-range antiaircraft systems.

And it will include drones, which demonstrates our commitment to sending our most cutting-edge systems to Ukraine for its defense. — President Biden (@POTUS) March 16, 2022

During a press briefing Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki noted that the U.S. is sending antiaircraft systems and stringer weapons to Ukraine. She said she would not go into specifics for security reasons, but that the weapons would be used to shoot down planes.

“This is all defensive equipment and materials,” Psaki added.

She said the Ukrainian military could use the weapons to fight off the “unprovoked and unjustified” Russian attack. However, she said that neither the U.S. nor North Atlantic Treaty Organization troops would be interested in shooting down Russian planes through a no-fly zone at this time.

“We are not interested in getting into World War III,” Psaki said.

Zelensky has asked for a no-fly zone to be put in place.

“I have a dream. These words are known to each of you today,” Zelensky said Wednesday during a speech. “I can say, I have a need. I need to protect our sky. I need your help.”

Psaki did not know Wednesday if Zelensky would be present at a NATO summit planned for next week. Although she said the U.S. is still open to a diplomatic end to the conflict, Psaki said there has been no sign of de-escalation from the Russian Federation or Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Over the past week, the U.S. has provided Ukraine with $1 billion in aid, and has given a total of $2 billion over the past year. At least 30 counties have provided security equipment to the war-torn country.

Use of the Switchblade drones in Ukraine would be “the most significant use of the weapon in combat to date,” said NBC News.

Previously, the U.S. military used the Switchblade in combat “under limited circumstances” in Afghanistan and elsewhere, and the U.K. is the only foreign country authorized to buy the equipment, according to outlet.

Biden, who has previously ruled out a no-fly zone, said that the package instead would include more anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles for the Ukrainian military as part of this ""unprecedented"" aid package.

Biden did not specify the type of drones that would be sent or the amount, but the ranking Republican congressman on the House Foreign Affairs Committee confirmed to Politico that it would include 100 Switchblades.

""We passed a bill to provide lethal weapons to [Zelensky] and the President has just signed it today to help the people of Ukraine defend themselves against Russian aggression,” Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas) said in a video statement on Twitter.

Unlike the typically larger armed drones used by the U.S. military like the MQ-9 Reaper, the Switchblade is a 5.5lb “tactical” drone that is small enough to be carried in a backpack and launched by a small unit.

The Switchblade, which has undergone testing across the armed forces since 2012, is what is known as a “loitering munition”. Compared to a normal armed drone, a loitering munition can hover above a target for a certain amount of time before guiding itself into a target once one is identified by the operator.

According to Defense News, the latest model of the Switchblade, known as the Switchblade 600, can hover for up to 40 minutes at a range of about 25 miles and can travel into a target at about 115mph.

Switchblades have been used by U.S. Special Forces against the Islamic State in Syria, but other models of loitering munitions have been used to devastating effect in the September 2020 war between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

This sale adds an additional degree of lethality to Ukraine’s military for use against Russia. To date, Ukrainian forces have racked up scores of destroyed Russian armored vehicles and helicopters using U.S.-provided Stinger and Javelin missiles.

A decision to provide more guided missiles on-top of Switchblades is bound to be castigated by Russia.

Republicans criticized President Joe Biden on Wednesday for moving too slowly in helping arm Ukrainian forces and demanded that he help deliver Polish MiG-29 fighter jets to bolster its defense against the Russian invasion.

They spoke after Biden called Vladimir Putin a 'war criminal' and unveiled an $800 million military package which includes 100 killer drones and thousands of anti-tank weapons.

And it followed an impassioned plea to Congress by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for a no-fly zone.

'Zelensky knows what he's asking for,' Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming told Fox News.

'He needs the mix. We have a bipartisan group that says: Give this man the aeroplanes that he needs. He needs the sky to be protected.

'Joe Biden's been slow on that to me. They're a game changer.'

Biden has been under pressure to do more to bolster Ukrainian forces, who have been using foreign Javelin anti-tank weapons and Stinger missiles to defend their cities.

'We’re going to give Ukraine the arms to fight and defend themselves through all the difficult days ahead,' he said as he laid out a comprehensive list of weapons on their way to the war.

They include 100 grenade launchers, 5,000 rifles, 1,000 pistols and more than 20 million rounds of ammunition.

But the most exciting addition is likely to be the 100 tactical unmanned aerial systems, reported to be 'Switchblade' drones which deliver their deadly payload by crashing into targets.

Even so, the package does not include the planes demanded by Zelensky nor will the Biden administration back calls for a no-fly zone.

Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma said it was a 'half measure' that failed to meet the moment.

'I've been clear that we should have been sending much more military aid to the Ukrainians, with more training, for more than a year,' he said.

'President Biden didn't do that, and now we're rushing to deliver aid just in time.'

In his appeal, Zelensky said defending the skies was crucial to defeating Russia.

'You know how much depends on the battlefield, on the ability to use aircraft, powerful, strong aviation to protect our people, our freedom, our land,' he said.

'Aircrafts that can help Ukraine help Europe and you know that they exist, and you have them, but they are on Earth, not in the Ukrainian sky.'

Last week Poland offered its 28 MiG-29s to Ukraine, but said it would hand them over to U.S. custody at Ramstein air base, in Germany, for delivery.

The announcement appeared to wrongfoot American officials, who eventually declined the offer.

They had been in talks to backfill Poland's air force with more modern F-16s, but were not prepared for a plan that involved such close involvement in the MiGs transfer to Ukraine.

At issue, is the danger of N.A.T.O. getting sucked into a war with Russia, and red lines laid down by Moscow.

The result has been growing pressure from lawmakers to help send the planes, while the Biden administration has at times got twisted up with multiple explanations about why the deal should not happen.

Biden himself ignored shouted questions about the MiGs during public appearances on Wednesday.

But last week, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Ukraine's air force remained largely intact, and Russian planes were avoiding exposure by launching missiles inside their own airspace.

'Therefore, we believe that the gain from transferring those MIG-29s is low,' he said.

'And finally, the intelligence community has assessed the transfer of MIG-29s to Ukraine may be mistaken as escalatory.

'And could result in significant Russian reaction that might increase the prospects of a military escalation with N.A.T.O.'

Biden has already ruled out a no-fly zone for fear of sparking World War Three with N.A.T.O. pilots going head to head with Russian flyers.

And delivering the planes could bring the same outcome. Polish or American pilots flying into Ukraine risks Russia accusing N.A.T.O. of entering the war.

Or if Ukrainian pilots travel to Poland to collect them, Moscow could accuse the Ukrainian air force of using foreign air fields - a potential 'casus belli' and grounds to attack Poland, according to a foreign diplomat familiar with discussions.

So how about towing them across the border - something the U.S. did in World War Two, when it gave planes to Canada before formally ending the conflict.

The White House has raised another distinction. Air defense systems, small arms and anti-tank weapons are defensive in nature, runs the argument, while Mig-29 fighter jets are offensive and capable of taking the fight to Russia.

'Again, I would note that the equipment that we've provided is defensive, as you know, not offensive and we see that as being a difference,' said White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Wednesday.

But with the addition of deadly drones - as well as grenade launchers, rifles and shotguns - on the list supplied to Ukraine, she faced repeated probing about what was so different about sending planes.

'Anybody that looks at that list of weapons that I just mentioned, they would say clearly, they're offensive,' said John Decker of Fox News Radio.

Psaki responded by saying: 'There is a difference between a plane, and planes, and massive military systems - I think anybody would recognise this.

'And what we were talking about, which is giving rifles and pistols to many of them farmers and people living in countrysides to defend themselves, I think there's a difference that most people recognize.'

After announcing $800 million in new military aid for Ukraine on Wednesday following Volodymyr Zelensky's impassioned address to Congress, Biden told reporters he believes Vladimir Putin is a 'war criminal'

Congress carries on calls for Biden to give jets to Ukraine over White House fears it could lead to escalation with Putin - while attacks on civilians continue

A number of lawmakers, including Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) on Wednesday, called on Biden to provide the planes, despite the administration's concern it could lead to escalation.

'This could be a long and difficult battle,' Biden predicted, as the invasion approached the end of its third week.

He denounced 'Putin’s immoral and unethical attacks,' and said the world was 'united in our abhorrence of Putin’s depraved onslaught.'

Biden also cited international efforts to put pressure on Russia's 'crumbling' economy, while 'isolating Putin' on the global stage. Zelensky also urged more action on that front, urging sanctions not only on Putin but on cronies deep within his government.

'That's our goal. Make Putin pay the price, weaken his position, while strengthening the hand of the Ukrainians on the battlefield and at the negotiating table. Together with our allies and partners, we’re going to stay the course. and we’re going to to push for to push for and end this tragic and unnecessary war,' Biden said, while flanked by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley.

Biden calling Putin a war criminal is not the first such denunciation by a world leader. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said earlier this month that Putin's targeting of civilians 'already fully qualifies as a war crime.'

Russia has so far denied deliberately targeting innocents, though reports from Ukraine paint a far more sinister picture.

New footage published by Ukrainian outlet Public appears to show Moscow's soldiers gunning down 10 civilians assembled in a bread line outside Chernihiv in northern Ukraine.

'This is not the first such incoming shell [in the city] nor is it the first shelling of civilians by the enemy. The Russians are shelling and destroying mostly civilian infrastructure in the city of Chernihiv and other cities in the region,' a local official named Vyacheslav Chaus said.

And drone video from last week shows Russian troops shooting and killing a Ukrainian civilian who held up his hands in surrender on a highway outside of Kyiv. A woman and child were pulled out of the car but it's not clear what their fates were.

The soldiers can be seen callously dragging the motorist's lifeless body to the side of the road and leaving it there.

Russian troops also bombarded the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia hours after roughly 20,000 civilians arrived there via humanitarian corridor.

They had come from Mariupol, where officials say thousands of civilians have perished as Russians surrounded the city and cut it off from power and supply lines.

Zelensky said last week that a young girl died of dehydration there, alone in the ruins of her home, after Moscow's shelling killed her mother. The report has not been verified by western media outlets.

The eastern Ukrainian city has also seen one of its maternity hospitals attacked. At least one pregnant woman and her baby died after the health facility was bombarded by Russian missiles.

Moscow had claimed the Mariupol hospital was being used by the Ukrainian military and that no civilians were present during the assault -- adding that images of wounded and bloody mothers were staged using crisis actors.

Russia has been accused of attacking humanitarian corridors where refugees are escaping several times, breaking agreed-upon ceasefires to slay civilians in cold blood.

The U.S. Senate unanimously voted to condemn Putin as a war criminal late on Tuesday, a rare show of unity in an otherwise highly divided Congress.

The resolution, introduced by Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), demands that the International Criminal Court in The Hague investigate the Russian military for war crimes, backing Ukraine's earlier request for the body to do so.

Canada also announced earlier this month that it would lend support to Kyiv by also referring Putin and his troops to the ICC.

On March 3 the ICC's chief prosecutor Karim Khan announced his intention to probe reports of Russian war crimes in Ukraine.

Biden is not the first world leader to accuse Putin of committing war crimes. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he carried out such atrocities in remarks earlier this month, as reports grew of Russian troops slaughtering civilians (pictured: Dead bodies are put into a mass grave on the outskirts of Mariupol, Ukraine, Wednesday, March 9)

The invasion has also created a refugee crisis, with the United Nations stating that more than 3 million people have fled Ukraine since Putin first ordered the attack on February 24 (pictured: Women rest as children play in a humanitarian aid tent, where refugees are coming to warm up and rest, after crossing from Ukraine into Poland at the Medyka border crossing, southeastern Poland on March 16)

Biden spoke at the White House shortly after Zelensky addressed American lawmakers in the first virtual address.

'I need to protect our skies. I need your help, which means the same you feel when you hear I have a dream,' he said.

'We need you right now,' Zelensky said, adding: 'I call on you to do more.'

Right as Kyiv's leader delivered his gut-wrenching address, Putin shared his own speech that was notably darker and more threatening.

In addition to the West, the autocrat also took aim at Russian oligarchs who have been increasingly opposed to the war.

He disparaged Moscow's elite who are frustrated at the West's targeted sanctions as 'traitors' as they find more and more of their assets in the U.S. and Europe seized by foreign authorities over their close ties to Putin.

'I do not judge those with villas in Miami or the French Riviera, or who can't get by without oysters or foie gras or so-called ""gender freedoms."" The problem is they mentally exist there, and not here, with our people, with Russia,' he said. 'The West will try to bet on the so-called fifth column, on traitors... to divide our society.. to provoke civil confrontation... to strive to achieve its aim. And there is one aim - the destruction of Russia.'

Putin claimed the West's sanctions were being levied only to prevent a 'strong and sovereign Russia.'

He added that Moscow was 'fighting for our sovereignty and the future of our children,' even as Ukrainian officials condemn him for slaughtering their own.

On Tuesday Biden signed a $13.6 billion package into law that provides military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine.

His speech followed reports the administration was considering providing U.S.-made kamikaze 'Switchblade' killer drones to Ukraine.

The small, lightweight and comparatively cheap 'kamikaze' weapons, which are effectively remote-controlled bombs, come in two versions which have been designed to take out tanks or artillery positions.

They are believed to be the same missiles that killed Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani under Donald Trump's administration in 2020.

U.S. military officials have noted the Ukrainians have been highly effective at using weapons to take out Russian tanks, trucks, and other armored vehicles.

Biden provided details on the deadly military equipment the U.S. was providing, which follows previous aid packages. He was joined by Secretary of State Antony Blinken (L), Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky issued a heartfelt plea for President Joe Biden and America to 'be the leader of the world' and help his country against Russian attacks in a speech where he appealed to U.S. heartstrings by comparing the crisis to the tragedies of 9/11 and Pearl Harbor and invoked Martin Luther King Jr. by saying: 'I have a dream... I have a need'

There have been reports of a rising death toll among Russian troops – as the staggering toll of civilian Ukrainian losses also rises.

The new aid package Biden just signs includes $6.5 billion to fund Pentagon troop deployments so the nation can bolster its presence in the region, plus $4 billion pays for humanitarian aid.

Although the aid package has been in the works for days, Biden set up his remarks to follow Zelensky's.

Zelensky concluded his speech with a personal appeal to Biden.

'I am addressing the President Biden. You are the leader of the nation, of your great nation. I wish you be the leader of the world. Being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace,' he said.

The two leaders spoke on a day when Russian President Vladimir Putin inveighed against 'scum' traitors and fifth columnists, after western officials have hoped openly that he might face an internal schism.

'I do not judge those with villas in Miami or the French Riviera. Or who can't get by without oysters or foie gras or so-called 'gender freedoms,' Putin said in a TV address. 'The problem is they mentally exist there, and not here, with our people, with Russia,' he said.

'The West will try to bet on the so-called fifth column, on traitors... to divide our society.. to provoke civil confrontation... to strive to achieve its aim.

Biden himself ignored shouted questions about the MiGs during public appearances on Wednesday.

But last week, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Ukraine’s air force remained largely intact, and Russian planes were avoiding exposure by launching missiles inside their own airspace.

‘Therefore, we believe that the gain from transferring those MIG-29s is low,’ he said.

‘And finally, the intelligence community has assessed the transfer of MIG-29s to Ukraine may be mistaken as escalatory.

‘And could result in significant Russian reaction that might increase the prospects of a military escalation with N.A.T.O.’

Biden has already ruled out a no-fly zone for fear of sparking World War Three with N.A.T.O. pilots going head to head with Russian flyers.

And delivering the planes could bring the same outcome. Polish or American pilots flying into Ukraine risks Russia accusing N.A.T.O. of entering the war.

Or if Ukrainian pilots travel to Poland to collect them, Moscow could accuse the Ukrainian air force of using foreign air fields – a potential ‘casus belli’ and grounds to attack Poland, according to a foreign diplomat familiar with discussions.

So how about towing them across the border – something the U.S. did in World War Two, when it gave planes to Canada before formally ending the conflict.

The White House has raised another distinction. Air defense systems, small arms and anti-tank weapons are defensive in nature, runs the argument, while Mig-29 fighter jets are offensive and capable of taking the fight to Russia.

‘Again, I would note that the equipment that we’ve provided is defensive, as you know, not offensive and we see that as being a difference,’ said White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Wednesday.

But with the addition of deadly drones – as well as grenade launchers, rifles and shotguns – on the list supplied to Ukraine, she faced repeated probing about what was so different about sending planes.

‘Anybody that looks at that list of weapons that I just mentioned, they would say clearly, they’re offensive,’ said John Decker of Fox News Radio.

Psaki responded by saying: ‘There is a difference between a plane, and planes, and massive military systems – I think anybody would recognise this.

‘And what we were talking about, which is giving rifles and pistols to many of them farmers and people living in countrysides to defend themselves, I think there’s a difference that most people recognize.’

After announcing $800 million in new military aid for Ukraine on Wednesday following Volodymyr Zelensky’s impassioned address to Congress, Biden told reporters he believes Vladimir Putin is a ‘war criminal’

Congress carries on calls for Biden to give jets to Ukraine over White House fears it could lead to escalation with Putin – while attacks on civilians continue

A number of lawmakers, including Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) on Wednesday, called on Biden to provide the planes, despite the administration’s concern it could lead to escalation.

‘This could be a long and difficult battle,’ Biden predicted, as the invasion approached the end of its third week.

He denounced ‘Putin’s immoral and unethical attacks,’ and said the world was ‘united in our abhorrence of Putin’s depraved onslaught.’

Biden also cited international efforts to put pressure on Russia’s ‘crumbling’ economy, while ‘isolating Putin’ on the global stage. Zelensky also urged more action on that front, urging sanctions not only on Putin but on cronies deep within his government.

‘That’s our goal. Make Putin pay the price, weaken his position, while strengthening the hand of the Ukrainians on the battlefield and at the negotiating table. Together with our allies and partners, we’re going to stay the course. and we’re going to to push for to push for and end this tragic and unnecessary war,’ Biden said, while flanked by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley.

Biden calling Putin a war criminal is not the first such denunciation by a world leader. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said earlier this month that Putin’s targeting of civilians ‘already fully qualifies as a war crime.’

Russia has so far denied deliberately targeting innocents, though reports from Ukraine paint a far more sinister picture.

New footage published by Ukrainian outlet Public appears to show Moscow’s soldiers gunning down 10 civilians assembled in a bread line outside Chernihiv in northern Ukraine.

‘This is not the first such incoming shell [in the city] nor is it the first shelling of civilians by the enemy. The Russians are shelling and destroying mostly civilian infrastructure in the city of Chernihiv and other cities in the region,’ a local official named Vyacheslav Chaus said.

And drone video from last week shows Russian troops shooting and killing a Ukrainian civilian who held up his hands in surrender on a highway outside of Kyiv. A woman and child were pulled out of the car but it’s not clear what their fates were.

The soldiers can be seen callously dragging the motorist’s lifeless body to the side of the road and leaving it there.

Russian troops also bombarded the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia hours after roughly 20,000 civilians arrived there via humanitarian corridor.

They had come from Mariupol, where officials say thousands of civilians have perished as Russians surrounded the city and cut it off from power and supply lines.

Zelensky said last week that a young girl died of dehydration there, alone in the ruins of her home, after Moscow’s shelling killed her mother. The report has not been verified by western media outlets.

The eastern Ukrainian city has also seen one of its maternity hospitals attacked. At least one pregnant woman and her baby died after the health facility was bombarded by Russian missiles.

Moscow had claimed the Mariupol hospital was being used by the Ukrainian military and that no civilians were present during the assault — adding that images of wounded and bloody mothers were staged using crisis actors.

Russia has been accused of attacking humanitarian corridors where refugees are escaping several times, breaking agreed-upon ceasefires to slay civilians in cold blood.

The U.S. Senate unanimously voted to condemn Putin as a war criminal late on Tuesday, a rare show of unity in an otherwise highly divided Congress.

The resolution, introduced by Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), demands that the International Criminal Court in The Hague investigate the Russian military for war crimes, backing Ukraine’s earlier request for the body to do so.

Canada also announced earlier this month that it would lend support to Kyiv by also referring Putin and his troops to the ICC.

On March 3 the ICC’s chief prosecutor Karim Khan announced his intention to probe reports of Russian war crimes in Ukraine.

Biden is not the first world leader to accuse Putin of committing war crimes. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he carried out such atrocities in remarks earlier this month, as reports grew of Russian troops slaughtering civilians (pictured: Dead bodies are put into a mass grave on the outskirts of Mariupol, Ukraine, Wednesday, March 9)

The invasion has also created a refugee crisis, with the United Nations stating that more than 3 million people have fled Ukraine since Putin first ordered the attack on February 24 (pictured: Women rest as children play in a humanitarian aid tent, where refugees are coming to warm up and rest, after crossing from Ukraine into Poland at the Medyka border crossing, southeastern Poland on March 16)

Biden spoke at the White House shortly after Zelensky addressed American lawmakers in the first virtual address.

‘I need to protect our skies. I need your help, which means the same you feel when you hear I have a dream,’ he said.

‘We need you right now,’ Zelensky said, adding: ‘I call on you to do more.’

Right as Kyiv’s leader delivered his gut-wrenching address, Putin shared his own speech that was notably darker and more threatening.

In addition to the West, the autocrat also took aim at Russian oligarchs who have been increasingly opposed to the war.

He disparaged Moscow’s elite who are frustrated at the West’s targeted sanctions as ‘traitors’ as they find more and more of their assets in the U.S. and Europe seized by foreign authorities over their close ties to Putin.

‘I do not judge those with villas in Miami or the French Riviera, or who can’t get by without oysters or foie gras or so-called “gender freedoms.” The problem is they mentally exist there, and not here, with our people, with Russia,’ he said. ‘The West will try to bet on the so-called fifth column, on traitors… to divide our society.. to provoke civil confrontation… to strive to achieve its aim. And there is one aim – the destruction of Russia.’

Putin claimed the West’s sanctions were being levied only to prevent a ‘strong and sovereign Russia.’

He added that Moscow was ‘fighting for our sovereignty and the future of our children,’ even as Ukrainian officials condemn him for slaughtering their own.

On Tuesday Biden signed a $13.6 billion package into law that provides military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine.

His speech followed reports the administration was considering providing U.S.-made kamikaze ‘Switchblade’ killer drones to Ukraine.

The small, lightweight and comparatively cheap ‘kamikaze’ weapons, which are effectively remote-controlled bombs, come in two versions which have been designed to take out tanks or artillery positions.

They are believed to be the same missiles that killed Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani under Donald Trump’s administration in 2020.

U.S. military officials have noted the Ukrainians have been highly effective at using weapons to take out Russian tanks, trucks, and other armored vehicles.

Biden provided details on the deadly military equipment the U.S. was providing, which follows previous aid packages. He was joined by Secretary of State Antony Blinken (L), Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky issued a heartfelt plea for President Joe Biden and America to ‘be the leader of the world’ and help his country against Russian attacks in a speech where he appealed to U.S. heartstrings by comparing the crisis to the tragedies of 9/11 and Pearl Harbor and invoked Martin Luther King Jr. by saying: ‘I have a dream… I have a need’

There have been reports of a rising death toll among Russian troops – as the staggering toll of civilian Ukrainian losses also rises.

The new aid package Biden just signs includes $6.5 billion to fund Pentagon troop deployments so the nation can bolster its presence in the region, plus $4 billion pays for humanitarian aid.

Although the aid package has been in the works for days, Biden set up his remarks to follow Zelensky’s.

Zelensky concluded his speech with a personal appeal to Biden.

‘I am addressing the President Biden. You are the leader of the nation, of your great nation. I wish you be the leader of the world. Being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace,’ he said.

The two leaders spoke on a day when Russian President Vladimir Putin inveighed against ‘scum’ traitors and fifth columnists, after western officials have hoped openly that he might face an internal schism.

‘I do not judge those with villas in Miami or the French Riviera. Or who can’t get by without oysters or foie gras or so-called ‘gender freedoms,’ Putin said in a TV address. ‘The problem is they mentally exist there, and not here, with our people, with Russia,’ he said.

‘The West will try to bet on the so-called fifth column, on traitors… to divide our society.. to provoke civil confrontation… to strive to achieve its aim. And there is one aim – the destruction of Russia,’ he claimed.",https://usmail24.com/republicans-say-bidens-new-ukraine-weapons-deal-is-not-enough-and-that-he-should-send-mig-fighters/
