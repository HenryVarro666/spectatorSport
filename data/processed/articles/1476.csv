Geneva (AFP) – More than 3.25 million refugees have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion, the United Nations said Friday, with more than two million crossing the Polish border.

UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, said 3,270,662 people had joined the exodus since the war began on February 24, or another 100,765 since Thursday's update.

""We have seen a general slowdown"" in flow since the early days of the conflict, said UNHCR spokesman Matthew Saltmarsh.

As for people still within Ukraine who have left their homes, ""It's safe to assume the number is considerably higher than two million"", he said.

However, ""the pace and magnitude of the internal displacement and refugee exodus from Ukraine, as well as resulting humanitarian needs, will only increase if the situation deteriorates.""

Some 90 percent of those who have fled are women and children, he added. Ukrainian men aged 18 to 60 are eligible for military call-up and cannot leave.

The UN's International Organization for Migration said that as of Wednesday, 162,000 third-country nationals had fled the country.

The UNHCR initially estimated that up to four million people could leave Ukraine, but last week admitted that figure might well be revised upwards.

Before the conflict, Ukraine had a population of 37 million in the regions under government control, excluding Russia-annexed Crimea and the pro-Russian separatist regions in the east.

Here is a breakdown of where Ukrainian refugees headed to, according to UNHCR:

Poland

Six in every 10 Ukrainian refugees crossed the Polish border, or 1,975,449 people so far, according to the UNHCR's latest figures.

But Poland's border guards said that by 0800 GMT on Friday, the total number of refugees crossing from Ukraine had exceeded two million.

Tens of thousands of people are also entering Ukraine from Poland -- mostly those returning to fight but also others seeking to care for elderly relatives or to bring their families out to Poland.

The data of arrivals into Ukraine's neighbouring countries which are in Europe's Schengen open-borders zone -- Poland, Hungary and Slovakia -- only represent border crossings into that country.

""We estimate that a large number of people have moved onwards to other countries,"" UNHCR said.

- Romania -

The UNHCR said more than half a million people had now made their way into Romania.

Some 508,692 have reached the country, including people who had crossed over from Moldova to reach the EU member state.

The UNHCR figures per neighbouring country are 281,563 higher than their overall total -- a difference which the agency says reflects the number of people who crossed between Moldova and Romania.

The vast majority are thought to have made their way onto other countries further into Europe.

Moldova

The UNHCR said 355,426 Ukrainians had crossed into the non-EU state wedged between Romania and Ukraine. It is the closest border to the major port city of Odessa.

Many Ukrainians fleeing the fighting transit through Moldova, a small nation of 2.6 million people and one of the poorest in Europe, en route westwards to Romania and other countries beyond.

Hungary

Ukrainian refugees who have crossed into Hungary number 291,230.

Hungary has five border posts with Ukraine and several frontier towns, including Zahony, where local authorities have turned public buildings into emergency centres for refugees.

Slovakia

A total of 234,738 refugees made it across Ukraine's shortest border into Slovakia.

Another 5,894 Ukrainians entered Slovakia on Thursday.

Russia

Some 184,563 refugees have sought shelter in Russia.

In addition, UNHCR said 50,000 people had crossed into Russia from the pro-Russian Donetsk and Lugansk regions of eastern Ukraine between February 21 and 23.

Belarus

And 2,127 refugees have made it to Belarus, the UNHCR says.

MICHALOWO, Poland — Her impulse was to welcome people in desperation, so Maria Ancipiuk made sure her border town was ready. As immigrants mostly from the Middle East started streaming into Poland last year from Belarus, she lobbied the mayor to offer up two empty town-owned apartments for anybody who might need them. Volunteers changed the wallpaper and renovated the flooring. Ancipiuk bought a refrigerator and a television.

Five months later, though, the apartments are empty.

Rather than being welcomed into Polish homes, the vast majority of people crossing from Belarus are being detained or pushed back by Polish authorities.

That stance, in effect just to the north of Poland’s border with Ukraine, means two different groups seeking the same thing — refuge — are arriving to find what amounts to two different versions of Europe.

Along one segment of Poland’s border, where 2.5 million Ukrainians have fled, border agents help carry duffel bags, push wheelchairs, hold tired children and escort to safety refugees who’ve been granted automatic European Union residency for up to three years.

On another segment of that border, Poland is trying to stop what it describes as “illegal” immigrants by using drones, infrared cameras and helicopters. It has dispatched 13,000 soldiers and border guards to patrol the forested boundary, while sealing off the area — under an emergency decree — to journalists and human rights groups. It is hurrying to finish a $380 million 116-mile steel wall that the government says will be “impenetrable.”

“I cannot stand the contrast,” said Ancipiuk, a 65-year-old town councilor and grandmother of six who now furtively provides aid to immigrants trying to move through the Polish forest at night. “Ukrainians are considered war refugees and Yemenis are considered migrants. Why? What is the difference?”

Poland’s approach is in line with the broader E.U. policy of forcefully deterring undocumented immigration — including from parts of the world where there are few legal options for reaching this continent. The E.U. has been funding the Libyan coast guard to thwart immigrants from crossing the Mediterranean to Italy. In Greece, security forces have been accused by immigrants and by Turkey of repelling would-be asylum seekers back into Turkish waters. And when Poland vowed to block people trying to cross from Belarus — a crisis orchestrated by authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko, who lured people to his country with the promise of access to Europe — E.U. leaders said Poland was justifiably responding to a “hybrid attack.”

Months later, though, Poland’s national human rights institution says the country is not living up to European ideals — and is also violating international law.

It is illegal for security authorities to expel foreign nationals without giving them a chance to claim asylum. Yet humanitarian groups have documented Polish border guards tracking down people in the woods and driving them back to the Belarusian border, a practice that Poland’s parliament has effectively legalized. Poland so thoroughly patrols the border that some immigrants say they’ve been pushed back to Belarus more than a half-dozen times. The Council of Europe’s human rights commissioner said one person who returned to Belarus had given birth only hours earlier.

Poland has garnered much praise for its willingness to accept so many refugees in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But the war also leaves Poland in a position where it is sending people back to a country that is serving as a staging ground for missiles launched into Ukraine.

“Poland should not be sending anybody back,” said Hanna Machinska, Poland’s deputy commissioner for human rights. “Belarus is not a safe country. There is no question about it.”

Belarus has one of the world’s most repressive governments, and its approach to immigrants is also harsh: Though it invited thousands of people, it appears to have no interest in hosting them; hundreds spent the winter in a warehouse, and when the facility was recently shuttered, the immigrants were taken to the Polish border and given instructions to leave.

For those crossing from Belarus who are fortunate enough not to be pushed back, the next stop is generally a closed detention center, including one where people are kept in rooms with 24 beds. Poland permits only a small subset to move into alternative facilities — like the homes Ancipiuk had prepared in Michalowo. Since January, as the overall flow from Belarus started to decline, the number of lucky few has been zero.

In mid-March, Ancipiuk received a call from a regional official, notifying her of funding incentives for towns that would host Ukrainians.

She asked if there were similar incentives for hosting people who’d crossed from Belarus.

“There was a bit of consternation on the line,” Ancipiuk said.

She never heard back with an answer but took the silence as a no. Her town is now offering the two apartments to refugees from Ukraine as well.

At Poland’s border agency headquarters in Warsaw, Lt. Anna Michalska said her country is responding as any should: by defending order and its own laws. Lukashenko had precipitated the emergency in a place where undocumented border-crossings had once been “practically zero,” she said, and she argued that the people who’d taken the offer to go to Belarus had the time and luxury to plan their journey. They booked tourist visas. Unlike Ukrainians, she said, they are not looking “for the first place to be safe.”

What they tend to want above all, she said, is a life in Germany.

She denied the widely documented accusation that Poland is pushing back people who request asylum. Most people don’t want to apply for protection, she said, knowing such a request triggers a mandatory stay in the country. She said there is no legal problem in returning people to Belarus.

“I don’t have information that there is war in Belarus,” she said. “We’re not a taxi service from Belarus to Berlin.”

So Poland is building its wall. The border agency granted two Washington Post journalists access to the restricted zone, providing them a meeting point five miles from Belarus, where a border guard van was waiting. In the exclusion zone, police worked checkpoints, and the road through villages and small farms was all but empty, aside from military vehicles. The border guards described a daily tension: immigrants who launch stones at security authorities, smugglers who run routes to and from Germany, activists who communicate with the immigrants and “incentivize” them to cross.

Then the van stopped at the wall.

It is partially completed, composed of 18-foot-high planks of vertical steel beams, with tiny spaces in between. The spaces provide visibility to the other side, and from afar, the wall has the look of a translucent silver strip running along the horizon, covering a territory where this year there have been more than 3,500 attempts to cross.

“Everything is going according to plan,” said Katarzyna Zdanowicz, a border guard spokeswoman who was on the tour. She said the wall would be completed in June.

She said the border guard over the past months has improved “a lot” in its efficiency in stopping people. While waiting for the wall to be completed, the agency has strung razor wire across the border, plowed new roads and purchased tear gas canisters.

As part of the tour, Zdanowicz walked over to a green-painted Toyota SUV, parked in a field, where two agents were patrolling the border with high-resolution cameras.

“We’re trying to show that this is not the way to come,” she said.

In villages near the border, some residents — sympathetic to the plight of immigrants — have taken to turning on green lights in their homes, a signal that they have a safe place to stay for someone on the run. Michalska, the border official in Warsaw, said it is permissible to provide housing for somebody coming from Belarus — on the condition that the host immediately alerts the border guards.

“Otherwise,” she said, “you’re offering help for an illegal stay in Poland.”

Activists and human rights officials say Poland is treating the immigrants coming through Belarus as universally undeserving of protection in Europe, when that is not always the case. Some come from countries, such as Cameroon, whose citizens rarely win asylum in Europe. But others come from countries such as Yemen, ravaged by war, or Syria, where towns have been decimated by Russian airstrikes.

For Ibrahim Al Maghribi, 27, a Syrian, seeing Poland’s response to Ukraine has made him feel all the more confounded about the inequities.

After being displaced from his home outside Damascus, all he wanted was safety and a “decent life,” he said in an interview conducted over WhatsApp, because he said he could be more articulate with written English.

To get that life, he booked a tour package to Belarus, where he was chauffeured by members of the Belarusian military to a spot along the Polish border they said was easy to cross. After walking miles overnight in the Polish forest, he was arrested by Polish border guards, who told him “this is not your land.” He was returned to Belarus, which denied him reentry as well, leaving him stuck briefly between two borders, before trying to enter Poland again. This time, he and some friends successfully reached the car of a smuggler and eventually wound up in Germany — a trip that cost him $5,000, paid to tour guides and drivers, as well as several nights of exhaustion and sleeplessness.

“It’s a horrible feeling to feel that you came from another planet,” said Al Maghribi, who is now applying for asylum and living in a public housing complex in Rieden, Germany. The same Polish authorities who welcome Ukrainians wouldn’t even “offer us a glass of water,” he said.

One consequence of Poland’s approach is that immigration along the Belarusian border has been pushed nearly out of view. Poland denied a request to visit the closed centers holding asylum seekers.

Activists say they have had to become more cautious after Poland last month arrested four volunteers on charges of organizing illegal immigration.

Even the number of immigrant deaths in Poland is disputed; the government says nine have died since the middle of last year, while activists put the number at more than two dozen. Among the unknowns is what happens to immigrants who are pushed back and don’t return — including two Kurdish families, both with infants, who were repelled several times after crossing into Poland and recently fell out of communication with activists.

“We can’t reach them,” said Monika Matus, an activist working with one of the main border activist groups. “This is the reason I’m having a hard time sleeping at night.”

Even at the height of the crisis, in November, the volume of people crossing was about 700 per day — compared with tens of thousands of Ukrainians. Now, the number arriving from Belarus has dropped even further; some days, as many as 130 try to cross, according to Polish government data. Other days, it’s only a few dozen. The decrease stems in part from pressure on international airlines and tour groups to discontinue the immigrant pipeline to Belarus. Some of those crossing now enter Belarus not directly but via Russia. Activists who used to be overwhelmed by middle-of-the-night SOS calls now go some days without a single alert.

For Poland, it’s a sign that its tactics are working.

For activists, it’s a sign that Poland’s response has been disproportionate.

“We’re spending so much money to create a fortress,” said Tomasz Thun-Janowski, a volunteer for the humanitarian aid group Fundacja Ocalenie, “when helping them would cost a fraction.”

Krakow, Poland – In four weeks of war, three million people have left war-ravaged Ukraine with the majority crossing into Poland.

While the welcome from the government and civil society has been open-armed, space is running out for the newcomers.

Krzysztof Chawrona, a 41-year-old entrepreneur from Krakow and founder of Nidaros, an organisation that supports Ukrainian nationals, is among those who have given up space in their own homes for refugees.

“My son is staying with his auntie because I gave my flat away to eight refugees,” Chawrona, father of four, told Al Jazeera. “In my second flat, which I used to rent out to one company, there are seven people in 40 square metres. And they are grateful that they have a place to stay.”

He said that on February 24, the first day of Russia’s invasion, cities across Poland became quickly stretched. In Krakow, people from Ukraine slept on the pavement in front of his foundation’s office.

And as each day passes, thousands more people arrive by train, seeking shelter in the main cities of Warsaw, Krakow and Wroclaw.

Chawrona opened his foundation four years ago to help Ukrainian migrant workers settle in and adapt to new realities while learning the language and getting paperwork done.

Many ended up being employed in his construction company.

But the organisation’s focus has now switched to supporting refugees.

When the war began, Chawrona’s first step was to evacuate the families of his Ukrainian employees to Poland.

The Nidaros office has also been converted into a 60-bed refugee shelter.

So far, the group has supported 1,200 people in finding accommodation in Krakow.

On weekends, Chawrona travels alone into Ukraine, taking medicine and other essential items for hospitals in Vinnytsia and Khmelnytskyi. A friend used to go with him but no longer takes the risk after coming under shelling.

However, the biggest challenge for his group is financing.

“We had 70,000 zloty [$16,600] in our budget,” he said. “We’re now out of cash.

“We only have two microwaves. We have dozens of beds and we have to change the sheets every day, but we only have one small washing machine. We cannot cope with all this financially. The city is doing a lot, but it’s nothing when we look at the actual needs.”

About 150,000 Ukrainians have so far travelled to Krakow.

Local authorities have turned every available space – sports halls, dormitories and hotels – into shelters, and it is currently near impossible to find a flat or an affordable hotel room in the city of 700,000.

The city council’s crisis response fund was 19 million zloty ($4.5m); it has already spent more than 16 million ($3.8m).

These days, Malgorzata Jantos, deputy of the Krakow City Council and a lecturer in philosophy, spends all her time trying to help refugees find a home.

While she sips morning coffee in her kitchen, her phone does not stop ringing.

“Krakow is stuck. All halls, dormitories are packed. So we have to find places out of the city. The situation is hard because Ukrainians don’t want to leave,” Jantos told Al Jazeera, explaining that Ukrainians prefer to stick to big cities, fearing that smaller towns and villages lack infrastructure and job opportunities.

Looking ahead, it will likely be difficult to convince people to go abroad.

Poland is close to Ukraine, where many hope to return, and a familiar place culturally.

“Last night, a train to Hanover [in Germany] had 400 places and only 100 people left. People are afraid of leaving. Here they can communicate and find a job. In other countries it’s more difficult. An older Ukrainian man approached me and cried that he does not imagine life in Germany. He only wants to survive five more years and die,” Jantos said.

Krakow has, in effect, turned into a large humanitarian organisation as locals mobilised en masse to support Ukrainians.

But many are calling for European Union assistance and demanding more from the government in Warsaw to deal with the crisis.

“The central government must have been informed by the US about the war coming, and yet they didn’t prepare for the crisis,” said Jantos.

According to experts, Poland should be preparing for months, if not years, of crisis.

“I think that per analogy with the Syrian conflict – although there are many differences – even [25 percent] of Ukrainian citizens might leave the country.

“It is about 10 million people and even half of them might want to stay close to home, including Poland,” said Konrad Pędziwiatr, professor at the department of international affairs at the Krakow University of Economics.

“Big cities have already exploited their absorption capacities … But we also know from other migrant crises, in other parts of the world, that cities have the capacity of enlarging themselves, even more than their governments would expect.

“What we need is to start thinking more creatively, which will allow us to accept even more refugees.”

But the higher the number of refugees, the lower the quality of reception, he said.

One solution might be found in relocating refugees within Poland.

Smaller towns and villages have not yet exploited their capacity when it comes to healthcare and childcare – important provisions given the high number of children arriving.

For that, observers said Poland needs a clear information campaign that highlights to refugees the benefits of settling in smaller towns. Otherwise, Polish cities will struggle to function.

“Many people sleep at train stations. I’m trying to find accommodation for them, we are all networked and the network is a blessing,” Jantos said. “But there are so many people that accommodating everyone will soon become impossible.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/18/polish-cities-running-out-of-capacity-to-help-ukraine-refugees

The influx has been one of the largest movements of refugees in European history and large numbers continue to arrive, with 52,500 people crossing into Poland yesterday and 59,000 the day before.

The Polish government estimates that around three quarters of those who have arrived in Poland remain there, including 300,000 currently being housed in Warsaw, whose population has increased by 17% as a result. Another 100,000 are estimated to be staying in Kraków.

The influx has been met with a mass mobilisation by Polish state institutions, businesses, religious organisations, and civil society to help the new arrivals, and a new poll indicates that almost 95% of the public supports accepting the refugees.

According to estimates by the UN’s refugee agency, UNHCR, more than 3.1 people have fled Ukraine since Russia’s invasion on 24 February. Millions more have been displaced internally.

Around two thirds of those who have left the country have crossed into Poland. Among them, around half are children, with women and the elderly making up most of the remainder. Previous reports have indicated that around 6% are not Ukrainian nationals.

Speaking two days ago, deputy interior minister Paweł Szefernaker told Radio Plus that, of the “almost two million refugees who arrived from Ukraine, about 1.5 million have stayed in Poland”. That figure would represent around 4% of Poland’s previous population.

The population of Warsaw has risen 17% due to the arrival of 300,000 refugees from Ukraine President Duda yesterday ""appealed to the entire international community"" for help with the refugee crisis. Otherwise ""we will be in a very difficult situation"" https://t.co/9JBDNfAoBv — Notes from Poland 🇵🇱 (@notesfrompoland) March 17, 2022

A new poll by CBOS published this week showed that 94% of the Polish public favour accepting the refugees with only 3% opposed. That matched polling earlier in the crisis, which also showed strong support for accepting refugees from Ukraine.

However, a number of large cities – including Warsaw and Kraków – have warned that they are reaching the limits of how many people they can help, and have called on the government to seek international support.

Those calls were backed by President Andrzej Duda this week, who “appealed to the international community to help Poland” deal with the refugee crisis.

Last week, a new law was introduced to support Ukrainian refugees, including legalising their stay in Poland and giving them access to work, healthcare, education and benefits. As of yesterday, 65,000 new Ukrainian children had started attending Polish schools since the Russian invasion, a figure that could rise to hundreds of thousands.

​Natalia Panowicz is the CEO of Codility, a software-as-a-service platform that evaluates the skills of software engineers. Codility is a global remote-first organization with part of the team residing in Warsaw, Poland, and helps companies build and grow high-performing engineering teams. Its core values are ""we're human, we think big, we take ownership and we're real.""



These values have made possible its immediate and comprehensive response to the war in Ukraine, which Panowicz described as ""an unprovoked invasion and aggression on behalf of Russia against their democratic neighbor."" She spoke to SHRM Online about the actions her company has taken.

What is it currently like in Warsaw and other parts of Poland, with people from Ukraine arriving and needing assistance?

Since the beginning of Russia's horrific war in Ukraine, almost 2 million refugees have made it to Poland. Poland borders Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, and prior to the war, there already was a vibrant community of more than 1 million Ukrainians working and living in Poland. This war feels very real and very close to anybody in Poland. The Polish authorities are providing immediate work permits, social security numbers, [and] universal health care for each refugee and support for their hosts. There's an unprecedented outburst of help from so many people in Poland who take refugees to their homes, make donations and prepare meals.



Are you assisting your own employees that have come from Ukraine and, if so, how? Are you helping provide assistance to others?

The Codility team is global and comprises people coming from 30 different countries. While we do not have operations in Ukraine, Belarus or Russia, we have team members coming from these countries with close [family and friends] in active war zones in Ukraine. We have team members from other countries whose former colleagues or close ones are there, too. Part of our global team resides in Warsaw. Together with our Warsaw-based colleagues, we have organized immediate support for close ones of our team members, engineering community and business community. We are currently sheltering in Warsaw over 90 people who managed to flee the war, and are prepared to help others.

We have pledged our engineering support to Ukrainian nongovernmental organizations as part of the Tech To The Rescue initiative and will be matched with projects and teams that will benefit from our engineering expertise.

Our Women Employee Resource Group (ERG) has donated their funds to humanitarian aid in Ukraine. Our People of Color ERG is in the process of donating theirs specifically to aid refugees of color. Many of our team members decided to pledge their Codility mental health support allowance to humanitarian aid. We continue to work with the team on various aid initiatives for Ukraine and victims of this war. One of Codility's key values is ""we're human,"" and I'm immensely proud of how our team demonstrates this through their actions.

What can those in the U.S. who would like to help do to assist those fleeing Ukraine?

Consider donating to organizations helping refugees, like the United Nations Refugee Agency, actively participate in civic actions in support of Ukraine and spread verified information about this war. We've seen how public pressure on politicians in the U.S. and Europe resulted in tangible support for Ukraine already, and there is more that countries can do to help stop this war.

How has your organization and others prioritized supporting colleagues in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus?

We do not have operations on the ground in these countries, but Ukrainian, Russian and Belarusian colleagues work with us in Poland, Germany and in the U.S. We're supporting them with help for their close ones who are making it out of Ukraine. One of our U.K. team members was in Russia when the war started. We're assisting this team member and their family in making it back to the U.K.

What challenges are some of your employees facing?

Our team members with close ones in the active war zones fear for their close ones' lives and are actively helping them, whatever decision on staying or fleeing they're making. Our Ukrainian colleagues are experiencing their country of origin under horrific invasion by Russia, who is committing war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine. Our Russian and Belarusian colleagues are processing the horrors of the war that their country is committing or complicit in. We have many other team members coming from other countries whose close ones are in Ukraine. For our Polish team members, this war is a strong emotional trigger. We have team members from current or former conflict zones in other countries for whom this is a trigger, too.

How is Russia's attack an emotional trigger for some employees in Poland?

Throughout many centuries of Poland's history, Russia has invaded and occupied Poland over and over again. Poland was invaded by both Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia during World War II, which took the lives of 20 percent of Poland's pre-war citizens: 6 million people, including 3 million Polish Jews. Warsaw, the capital of Poland, was completely destroyed by Nazi Germany after two months of the uprising and in-city fighting. Every family has war stories to tell. Russia's war in Ukraine feels eerily familiar to people in Poland, hence a strong emotional trigger.

What types of contingency plans are being made, and why are they being developed?

While we consider the war spilling over to Poland—which is both a NATO and European Union country—very unlikely, we prefer to be prepared and hope we won't ever need to trigger any contingency plans. We've established an emergency committee that is responsible for making sure that our people and their families will make it safely outside of the zones in danger.

What's the main takeaway for employers as they witness the invasion of Ukraine?

This is the biggest war in Europe since the end of World War II. It is changing the world order and will impact the global economy. Your employees may be coming from the region or have close ones in active war zones. As we're all navigating this war, strong values, adaptability and resilience will be key.

The Russian Defense Ministry on April 16 said it had cleared the Mariupol urban area of Ukrainian troops and had trapped a few remaining fighters in the Azovstal steel plant, according to Russian state-run media.

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

A Russian Defense Ministry spokesman was quoted by Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency as saying that Ukrainian forces have lost a total of 4,000 troops during the long fight for the city -- a battle that has caught the world’s attention for its brutality.

Casualty figures from both sides have proved impossible to independently confirm during the conflict, which began with Russia's unprovoked invasion on February 24.

Ukraine has not commented on the latest Russian claims but in recent days has indicated the situation in Mariupol was desperate, with deaths mounting among the trapped civilian population and many experts predicting the city would soon fall to the Russians.

In an interview published earlier on April 16 with Ukrayinska Pravda, Zelenskiy warned Russia against committing atrocities against Ukrainian soldiers in the city.

""The elimination of our troops, of our men [in Mariupol] will put an end to any negotiations,” he said.

""That will bring an impasse as we don't negotiate on either our territories or our people,"" he added.

Peace talks have taken place between the two sides since Russia's invasion began, with little or no progress.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Reports early on April 16 said heavy fighting continued in several parts of Mariupol as Ukrainian troops attempted to fend off Russian soldiers who have been bolstered by reinforcements in recent days.

""The situation is very difficult [in Mariupol],"" Zelenskiy said early in the day. ""Our soldiers are blocked, the wounded are blocked. There is a humanitarian crisis.... Nevertheless, the guys are defending themselves.""

As the battle for the ruins of Mariupol appeared to be near its bloody end, air-raid sirens could be heard in many other parts of Ukraine on April 16, including in Kyiv, after Russia said it would seek revenge on the capital for what it claimed, without evidence, was Ukrainian targeting of Russian border towns.

Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said at least one person was killed and several others wounded in early morning attacks.

""For those Kyivites who left and are already thinking of heading back to return to the capital, I ask you to refrain from this and stay in safer places,"" Klitschko said in a message on his Telegram channel.

Russian troops have faced tougher-than-expected resistance -- both from the Ukrainian military and from ordinary citizens -- forcing them to retreat from areas in the north and to focus on eastern and southern regions of Ukraine, including Mariupol.

In his nightly address to the nation, Zelenskiy said the success of Ukraine's military and that of international sanctions against Russia will determine how long the war will last.

""The success of our military on the battlefield has been really significant. Historically significant. But it's still not enough to clear our land from the invading forces,"" he said.

""The sanctions against Russia are very serious, economically painful. But it is not enough to starve Russia's military machine. We need to promote stronger, more destructive sanctions. This will determine how long this war will last,"" he added.

Russia's warning to inflict more damage on Ukraine came a day after it suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, the Moskva, which sank while being towed to port on April 14 after suffering heavy damage under circumstances that remain in dispute.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on the Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

The National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) has rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Kyiv did claim, however, to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Meanwhile, the United States and its Western allies continued to pile pressure on Moscow over its campaign.

The German government said on April 15 that it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.



The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Russia's Foreign Ministry on April 16 said it was banning British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Foreign Minister Liz Truss, and several other cabinet ministers over British measures aimed at isolating Moscow and crippling the country's economy.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

The UN refugee agency said as of April 16 that 4,836,445 million Ukrainians had left the country since the Russian invasion -- up by 40,200 from the previous day’s total.

Poland's government has promised refugees from neighboring Ukraine that they can stay in the country for up to 180 days and access the labor market, health care system and social benefits. Refugees need a PESEL number for that.

Polish authorities set up one of the biggest registration centers so refugees can apply for a PESEL number at the National Stadium in Warsaw. On Friday evening, a day before the center opened, long lines had already formed outside the building. Flasks full of hot tea were provided for the people waiting at the gate to the stadium.

""I will wait here as long as necessary. I need a work permit, I need to find work, and I need to do it as soon as possible,"" 24-year-old Viktoria told DW.

The IT specialist from Kyiv was allowed to go in at 9 a.m. the following day. During the night, she took turns standing in line with her friends and sleeping in a car in the stadium's parking lot. Viktoria's persistence paid off — she's hoping to get the PESEL number within a few days.

Others aren't so lucky. Anyone who got to the stadium after 7 a.m. had no chance of being served the same day. Volunteers had prepared purple wristbands and handed them out to those who were guaranteed to get their turn the next day.

Polish administration faces huge challenges

There are currently over 2 million Ukrainian refugees in Poland. Some 123,000 received PESEL numbers within the first two days of the registration drive.

Additional registration points — such as the one at the National Stadium — and registration buses that travel to refugee shelters should speed up the operation. City and municipal offices, which typically issue the national identity numbers, are overwhelmed.

In the Polish city of Przemysl, near the Ukrainian border, the city office is working at full speed, but with only four fingerprint machines and a total of seven officers, there are long waiting times here as well.

Oxana Kolesnyk used to work as a bank clerk in Ukraine.

""I don't speak Polish, and I expect it probably won't be possible to work at a bank,"" she told DW. ""But I need to find some kind of work quickly to secure a living for my son and me.""

Kokesnyk took her passport with her when she fled Ukraine, making the formalities easier. Those who escaped the war without proof of identity also receive refuge in Poland but registering and receiving an ID number takes longer.

Refugees face an uncertain future

A law recently passed by the Polish parliament ensures refugees' access to the labor market, health care and social benefits, including monthly child benefits of €110 ($121) per child.

New arrivals from Ukraine receive the equivalent of €70 in welcome money, after which they have to fend for themselves. The new law also guarantees Polish citizens who host Ukrainians the equivalent of €9 a day for expenses.

Alexandra Stefaniv from Lviv sits in the waiting room while her Polish relative Leon Bortnik helps fill out the application. The logistics entrepreneur from Przemysl is taking care of his Ukrainian relatives in a recently inherited apartment that had been empty.

""I suddenly got a call from my mother's sister from Ukraine. She asked me if I could host her and her immediate family. There is only one right answer to that,"" Bortnik tells DW.

He wants to help Stefaniv find a job and knows many people in the region. For Stefaniv, who is 46, her own future is highly uncertain.

""I'm confused. I have no idea what to do in Poland. Should I look for work? But I do hope that the war will be over soon and that I can return home,"" she says, adding that her husband stayed in Lviv, and she never planned to leave Ukraine.

Arrival of refugees a new phenomenon in Poland

Since the war started, 3.3 million Ukrainians have emigrated, many to Poland. Even before that, the country of 38 million people had more than a million Ukrainian migrants who left their country since the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014.

Refugees from Ukraine wait in line for aid in Krakow in Poland

In 2021, 90% of respondents in a survey by the University of Warsaw's Center for Prejudice Research said they accepted Ukrainians as colleagues and neighbors. In recent decades, migrants in Poland have accounted for a small fraction of society. Apart from Ukrainian emigrants since 2014, there is no other migrant group of comparable size.

Compared to other EU countries, Poland had closed itself off to migrants. The current arrival of refugees is a completely new phenomenon.

Leon Bortnik has been helping his relatives from Ukraine

After more than three weeks of an outpouring of solidarity during which Ukrainian war refugees were welcomed with open arms,questions are emerging in the media of how the already overburdened social and health care systems can serve millions more people. Concerns are also growing among some parent associations about the prospect of overcrowded school classes.

Polish society could feel overwhelmed

Agnieszka Lada-Konefal, deputy director of the German Poland Institute in Darmstadt, speaks of an enormous challenge for the administration and society that will irrevocably change the country.

""Poles will have to learn to live together with people who are somewhat different,” the political scientist told DW, adding it was an experience that many people already had with Ukrainians taking refuge in the country in recent years.

Schoolchildren will also have to learn to adapt to classmates with a different language and culture as well as difficult experiences of war, she said.

""Children and young people will have to cope with that,"" says Lada-Konefal.""They will have to learn to live with others, to open up. That is part of development.""

But parts of society may feel overwhelmed by the number of refugees, and more migration from Ukraine could also be used by populists to ""spread hatred and resentment,"" the political scientist said.

""If the costs are high and the crisis and the war drag on a for a long time, it's hard to say whether Polish society will be able to accept this and learn to live with it,"" Lada-Konefal adds.

8,daaca9f1-cc1f-4b1a-af61-41754c25c667,[],,"The Russia-Ukraine Crisis began on 24 February 2022. Since then, an estimated 3.2 million refugees, mainly women and children or elderly people have fled Ukraine, and there are an estimated 1.85 million internally displaced in Ukraine, heading west towards Dnipro, Kyiv and Lviv.

There are significant numbers of disabled or seriously ill children amongst those making it through, some of whom have been transferred for ongoing critical care soon after arriving in Poland.

Humanity First sent a first responder team from Germany to the Polish-Ukrainian border on 27 February, and since then they have been providing medical and food assistance to Ukrainian refugees with volunteers on rotation. HF is collaborating with UN agencies on the ground such as WHO, WFP, IOM and OCHA.

Most of the refugees in this part of Poland have been arriving via Lviv by car, coach or train and, having crossed the border, many have been able to get onward logistics and shelter arrangements through the excellent organisation by Polish authorities in Przemsyl, or further afield in Krakow and Warsaw.

Our medical volunteers have been working alongside Sauvetures Sans Frontieres (SSF). Due to the lengthy process of reaching the border and long queues of people waiting to be processed in the winter conditions, most patients have been presenting with a combination of fatigue, headache, sore throat and fever, and daily patient numbers have varied considerably. The main needs are primary care rather than trauma injuries on the Polish side. So far, our medical volunteers have treated 556 patients including a group of 50 orphans, and consulted hundreds more. Because HF has been providing medical services for a few weeks here, the team have been receiving donated medication and a defibrillator to a value of 7,000 EUR. Other doctors are also being directed to work with the HF team. Medication and resources have also been sent into Ukraine sufficient to treat at least 10,000 patients.

Humanity First also established a gazebo at the border at the Medyka camp being run by the Polish Red Cross. Every day, our team has been providing warm drinks and warm meals to those crossing into Poland. The queues on the Ukraine side have been lengthy and slow, so for the last week, HF has been providing hundreds of warm meals to those in the queues on the Ukrainian side. So far, HF has provided around 13,600 warm meals and more than 13,000 warm drinks of tea or coffee. We have even started providing fries for the children and provided 1,500 breakfast sandwiches. Refugees have been struggling to contact their loved ones, so our team has also handed out 800 free mobile SIM cards, and over 10,750 bags containing hygiene kits and high energy food.

HF has also set up a couple of buggies to help transport refugees and their luggage to the train station and this will increase for those moving on by rail rather than on the coaches.

A small response is also being started at the Moldova border. HF is setting up a system to support refugees at a number of camps near the border area.

Other HF branches across Europe have been supporting with resources, funds and volunteers. Medical volunteers with experience of working in emergency situations from North America and Europe are currently on standby to assist.

The team in Medyka are co-operating with local authorities and the Red Cross on a daily basis to improve processes around effectiveness, communications, safety and safeguarding at the camp. They have also been visited by many politicians and senior officials, as well as being interviewed by media outlets such as CNN, Asahi TV, VOI Radio and WELT. Communications to our team on the ground have improved since local authorities installed a mobile mast near the border camps.

Our assessment on the ground suggests there is no current need for HF to collect and send clothing, shoes or toys to the border areas. Most of the refugees have the belongings in a suitcase and do not have room to take additional items. Funds raised are being used to access resources locally based on the demand we are seeing from the refugees themselves.

Refugees from Ukraine have also been crossing the borders into Moldova, Hungary, Slovakia, Russia and Romania, and HF continues to assess needs at these other locations.",https://reliefweb.int/report/poland/ukraine-crisis-situation-update-03-19-march-2022
