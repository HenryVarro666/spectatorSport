He said a Ukrainian military helicopter and four drones had also been shot down.

The Russian military launched the much-anticipated invasion of Ukraine earlier on the same day, as President Vladimir Putin ignored international condemnation and sanctions and threatened other countries that any attempt to interfere would lead to ""consequences you have never seen.""

Big explosions were heard before dawn in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odesa as world leaders decried the start of a Russian invasion that could cause massive casualties and topple Ukraine’s democratically elected government. Russian military columns crossed the border into Ukraine toward Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Luhansk regions, Ukrainian border guard service said in what appears to be an assault along the entire border with Russia.

Seven soldiers died in Russian airstrikes in the first few hours of the invasion, Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said.

The head of the Ukrainian military said Thursday he had received orders from President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to repel the Russian invasion of his country.

""The supreme commander the Armed Forces of Ukraine gave orders to inflict maximum losses against the aggressor,"" Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Major General Valeriy Zaluzhny said.

Earlier on Thursday, Zelenskyy introduced martial law, saying Russia has targeted Ukraine’s military infrastructure and explosions are heard across the country. Zelenskyy said he had just spoken to President Joe Biden and the United States was rallying international support for Ukraine. He urged Ukrainians to stay home and not to panic.",https://www.dailysabah.com/world/europe/70-ukrainian-army-targets-including-11-airfields-destroyed-russia

Ukraine has reported dozens of casualties.

He said Russia destroyed 18 Ukrainian radar stations of the S-300 and Buk-M1 missile systems in addition to shooting down four Bayraktar TB-2 combat drones and one combat helicopter.

Eleven Ukrainian airfields, three command posts and a naval base have been “put out of operation,” Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said in a televised briefing.

Russia’s military said it has destroyed 74 Ukrainian military targets on the first day of its invasion into the pro-Western country Thursday amid conflicting reports over gains and losses inflicted on both sides.

Moscow’s Defense Ministry said that 14 Ukrainian soldiers have surrendered and will be released after they sign a renunciation of armed resistance.

Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, according to Konashenkov, ordered the Russian military to treat the captured troops “with respect” and create a safety corridor for their evacuation.

In the only admission of losses, Konashenkov said a Russian Sukhoi Su-25 attack aircraft crashed due to pilot error and the pilot catapulted to safety.

There was no immediate confirmation of Konashenkov’s figures.

Moscow and Kyiv have been racing to establish control over information in the fog of war.

Earlier in the day, Ukraine’s armed forces denied Russia’s claims of fleeing Ukrainian border guards and seized cities.

Ukraine’s military also said it used Javelin anti-tank missiles to “neutralize” 15 Russian T-72 tanks. It said earlier that it shot down at least seven warplane and two helicopters, destroyed five armored personnel carriers, killed around 50 and captured at least two Russian soldiers.

Russia’s Defense Ministry has dismissed Ukraine’s claims of downed warplanes and armored vehicles as a “lie.”

And Russia’s federal media regulator has threatened to block outlets that publish information from outside official Russian channels.

Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine before dawn Thursday, forcing residents to flee for their lives and leaving at least 40 Ukrainian soldiers and 10 civilians dead.

According to the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), Russia's armed forces amount to 900,000 troops, plus some 2 million reserves and more than half a million other forces.

Ukraine's forces meanwhile amount to barely more than the number of troops Russia had amassed around its borders, with a standing army of 14,000, 45,000 in the air force and 11,000 in the navy, according to the IISS. It has some 100,000 other forces and 900,000 reserve soldiers.

He further stated that a Ukrainian military helicopter and four drones had also been shot down. Meanwhile, Russian authorities warned anti-war sympathisers from gathering for protests after President Vladimir Putin launched an invasion of Ukraine.

The Investigative Committee, a government body that investigates major crimes, warned Russians of legal repercussions for joining unsanctioned protests related to ""the tense foreign political situation"". It said it was responding to social media calls to protest against Putin's decision to attack Ukraine. ""One should be aware of the negative legal consequences of these actions in the form of prosecution up to criminal liability,"" it said.

The Russian interior ministry said it will take ""all necessary measures to ensure public order."" Russia has strict protest laws and demonstrations often end in mass arrests.

Some Russians called on social media for people to take to the streets to protest against the Ukraine attack.

Independent rights monitor, OVD-info, said at least 27 people had been arrested throughout Russia for holding anti-war protests. Jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny said earlier on Thursday that he was against the invasion in a speech during his trial, held behind bars.



""I am against this war,"" Navalny was heard saying in a video published by independent news outlet Dozhd. ""This war between Russia and Ukraine was unleashed to cover up the theft from Russian citizens and divert their attention from problems that exist inside the country,"" Navalny said.
