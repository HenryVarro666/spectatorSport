The city is just 25 miles from the Russian border, but Ukrainian forces have thus far been able to prevent the advance of Russian ground troops. In retaliation, the Russians have spent the past weeks using artillery to bombard the city’s defenders and civilians. The residents of the most-targeted areas remain either trapped in their apartments, many without electricity and hot water, or have been sheltering in the city’s subway stations for weeks. A tour of Kharkiv last week made clear the city could be next to suffer a mass humanitarian crisis in a war that has already cost thousands of lives and displaced millions.

Most of this residential neighborhood feels abandoned. We are on the edge of the town, the frontier, where the fighting takes place. The Ukrainian military let us tour the area to see the destruction. Half of a 16-floor residential building, totally burned by the airstrike, looms over the street we are on. Personal belongings litter the pavement, including burned photo albums with the faces of the people who lived nearby, a stark reminder that this area was once full of life. Only rarely do the locals dare to venture out. I spot an old man in a doorway staring at me and my photographer. He looks scared.

“Why are you staying? Isn’t it dangerous?” I ask.

“I wish to leave,” he tells me. “I have been here for 18 days without electricity, the water in the pipes in my flat got frozen. I just do not know how to get out of here. I called some people. I wish to get to the train station.”

His name is Leonid Andriyovych, he is 72 and a grandfather. Even in these circumstances he is neatly dressed in suit trousers and clean shoes. He speaks in a soft voice. A journalist traveling with us suggests that we help the man right away. We tell him to get his documents. We need to get out of this dangerous area in a hurry, so he has to run upstairs to the ninth floor of the building he lives in to get his papers. The constant shelling continues.

“I saw you by accident,” Andriyovych tells me. “Most of the time I stay in my flat. Where else? There is this place in one of the basements where there was electricity to charge the mobile phone and boil hot water, so I went there now, but it’s better to be inside. Shrapnell killed a woman who was walking on the streets in front of my eyes.”

The elderly of Kharkiv suffer the most. Many, like Andriyovych, are stuck in their flats under heavy bombardment, the electricity in the suburban areas of town mostly doesn’t work; they are the least mobile and often have neither a place to go, nor the ability to easily get around the country.

Two or three minutes — that’s how much time Andriyovych has to grab the documents and flee from the flat he’s lived in for 30 years. He worked in one of the research institutes in Kharkiv — the largest scientific hub of Ukraine. His daughter and grandson managed to escape in the first hours of the war. He planned to make it later. But waiting even one day was too late.

As we drive away we pass a demolished kindergarten where Andriyovych’s grandson Oleh used to attend. “He will turn six at the end of March, he was going there till the first day of the invasion,” Andriyovych says. “I wonder when I will see him. But I am happy he is in a safe place in western Ukraine”.

On our way to the train station, Andriyovych asks, “Is Kharkiv still standing?” He’s been stuck inside his apartment building cowering in terror and is surprised to see parts of the city still function as we drive from the outskirts through an industrial part of town filled with warehouses, factories, and supermarkets. From time to time we see lines of people — mainly to the post offices, ATMs, or pharmacies. “I thought the whole city was like my area — burned, empty,” he says with some hope, “but here there are lines to the shops, people walking …”

We don’t show him downtown, so as not to disappoint him. In addition to the outskirts, the oldest, central part of Kharkiv was also bombed and is heavily damaged.

We ask the local volunteers to bring Andriyovych to the train station and to give him some hot food. The Ukrainian railroad has made all traveling free, and added trains to evacuate civilians. The station in Kharkiv — and every rail station all over the country — serves as a shelter offering warm food, relative safety, and a place to ​​charge your phone. Andriyovych says he’s going to stay with his sister in western Ukraine.

“We used to have a nice life here,” Andriyovych tells me as we say goodbye. “We didn’t have much trouble, things worked. I believe the war will be over soon. Don’t you think so too? It shouldn’t be like this, the world should find a solution. It can’t be otherwise.”

I nod. I didn’t want to disappoint him.

Many residents of Kharkiv believe that the brutality of the attacks on the city are Russian revenge for successfully resisting the invasion for so long. According to Putin, the fact that the majority of Kharkiv speaks Russian, and many have relatives over the border, the city would welcome the invaders. My friends and colleagues from Kharkiv had insisted to me this was not the case and they would resist. They were correct, but the city has paid a terrible toll.

I have friends who live on one of the most-damaged streets in the city. I visited them a month before the war. Today, everything lies in ruins. Their favorite wine store, the local bar, a boutique, the office building of a news agency are all destroyed, all that’s left is debris. Most of the buildings, windows blown out, are now covered with icicles. Mid-March has been unusually cold — hitting lows of -18 C, only adding to the misery .

“Doesn’t matter what, I will rebuild Kharkiv,” Anatolii, an architect tells me. “We possess all the drawings. I live here, I am Ukrainian, it’s my house. Unfortunately, now I am wounded.” He’s sitting on a bed in one of the city’s hospitals. (Rolling Stone has chosen not to reveal the specific location of the hospital at the request of sources, who all fear the Russians may deliberately target medical facilities.) A palm-size shell hit him in the leg. He wasn’t enlisted to the military and had stayed with his wife to take care of at least eight elderly people living in their apartment building.

“I went out to buy some groceries,” Anatolii recalls. “I was two minutes away from my home, just near the school, and felt insane pain. I started to crawl, then a man and a woman came to help me. My wife came down and managed to bind the wound, so I did not lose blood.” He’s worried that since he won’t be able to walk for a few months, he won’t be able to help the residents of his building.

The hospital is filled with wounded. Scores of new patients arrive 24 hours a day. The wounds from artillery shelling became the new norm. The doctors here are normally strict with the press, not wanting to violate their patients’ privacy. But since the war started and they are facing mass casualties every day, they have been allowing journalists into the emergency room “so the world can see,” one doctor tells me.

Stanislav, a middle-aged friendly man, volunteers at the hospital — cleaning, moving things around, anything to help. His son Dima’s life was recently saved here. Dima was in an apartment just a few minutes away from the Regional Administration in central Kharkiv when it was hit on March 1.

“He is an adult,” Stanislav tells me. “We call each other once a day. I received a call from an unknown person who said, ‘Dima is unconscious, he is bleeding at his home.’ I rushed there. It was not easy. The street was filled with debris, ambulances couldn’t get through easily. I saw him on the floor. I went down to the street to ask people there to help me to get him out.”

Three weeks after the incident, Dima can now talk. He has a hematoma in his head, and requires a complex operation. The last thing Dima remembers before waking in the hospital is the blast.

For the doctors, still reeling from the pandemic, the stress has been enormous. Maria Matvienko, an anaesthetist, describes the first week of the war as the hardest, because there were still too many civilians around. Up to 1.7 million people live in the city. Many Kharkiv residents refused to believe that a full-scale invasion was coming, but not because they were careless or naive. It was simply hard to accept that something like that was possible in the 21st century. Most expected that the Kremlin would just continue to meddle in Ukrainian politics or intensify fighting in eastern Ukraine, and would never bomb civilians.

The city authorities do not release the number of the casualties, but talk about there being about 1,200 wounded. The local police registered 250 deaths, but in many cases investigations have not been opened. The numbers of confirmed dead will almost certainly rise in the next weeks and months.

Matvienko herself now lives in the hospital with her husband and 11-year-old daughter, who wants to be useful, so, for instance, she entertains the younger patients. “A few doctors left, mainly those with small kids, but most stayed and we all live here in the facility,” Matvienko tells me. “It’s more convenient, as if something happens we can be ready within a moment. Kharkiv is my home. I love it. If we left, who would treat the people?”

The fiercest battles still take place in the villages outside the city, where the media have no access. On one of the first days of the war, Russian paratroopers managed to reach the middle of the town, but were pushed back. They hid in the school — one of the oldest in the town, which was badly damaged in the fight and set on fire. Firefighters were unable to put out the blaze. The paratroopers were reportedly all killed by Ukrainian troops. On the street I may see a burned military vehicle, but also packages of military rations marked “The Russian Army.”

Since the first days of the conflict, the Kharkiv subway system has served as a bomb shelter. One of the stations became an asylum for people who lost their houses or were afraid to go out. Some of them have stayed in the station for more than 18 days now.

“I thought Putin was a reasonable man, a smart person,” says Nina Maksymivna, 80. “Now I wish for him and also the Lavrov family, their kids, to suffer as much as we do. I don’t really know where to go. I have problems with my legs, I can’t move properly, so I just sit here all the time.” She was born in Kharkiv during World War II and didn’t expect to see another war in her lifetime.

There are volunteer groups that try to help evacuate the people, but the scale of the problem is too big. Even if half of the city has fled, almost a million remain. Currently, up to 600 people are camped on a subway platform and in trains. During the first bombardments, up to 2,000 people gathered there. Yulia, the head of the station, said the subway authorities made the decision to shut down the metro lines and let people walk along the tunnels to another station.

“Take your cups, hot borsch (the Ukrainian soup) is available,” the subway conductor who used to announce the next subway stop calls out.

To spend even three hours inside the station is difficult, and there are hundreds of old people who have been down here for weeks. Most of the people try to make the best of it. They read, talk, cry, play, laugh, and most of all, scroll through the news.

Every video statement from President Volodymyr Zelensky draws attention, and crowds huddle around phones. The president looks unshaved and tired. “This time he probably didn’t sleep,” someone near me says.

“I can imagine. I am responsible for about 2,000 people here, and after 18 days, we are drained; he bears responsibility for the whole country,” says Igor, a police officer who seems to be in charge of the subway station. He is 24, but looks way younger.

He’s a charismatic guy, and is followed around by the children in the station who treat Igor like a hero, asking him to give them orders to help. Igor graciously takes time to be their elder brother. He also addresses each grandma or anybody who asks anything, from what type of medicine to use to train schedules, but mostly he just hears people out and listens. His efforts help calm some of the people. Igor himself resides nearby. Before joining the police, he worked as an auto mechanic. He wants to go home to take a shower, but there is no hot water at his flat, the windows are broken, and it’s no longer habitable.

I ask why he is not wearing a uniform.

“My bosses were not happy about it,” Igor tells me. “But it’s more about security. Can you imagine if somebody wants to overtake the station or do something here? A person in uniform would be their primary target. But I would have at least five minutes to build a barricade, or start evacuating the people.”

What he says makes sense. A 24-year-old making calls that will mean life or death. Everyone here is in survival mode and preparing for the worst still to come.

As the end of Saturday nears in Ukraine, here's what you need to know.

Strikes in Lviv: There have been multiple strikes by Russia's military in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, according to local officials. There are reports of at least five people injured, according to Maksym Kozytsky, head of the Lviv regional military administration. So far, there have been no deaths at the first site of the missile strikes on Lviv, he said.

An industrial facility used for fuel storage was struck, with CNN's team on the ground observing a blazing fire and thick black smoke rising from the site.

Biden's speech: In neighboring Poland, US President Joe Biden declared forcefully in a speech that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""cannot remain in power,"" but the White House said afterward that it was not a call for regime change.

Biden also said that Russia has ""strangled democracy"" in its invasion of Ukraine and warned Putin to not ""even think about moving on one single inch of NATO territory.” He assured the Ukrainian people that he and the US ""stand with you.""

The US President also labeled Putin a ""butcher"" after visiting with Ukrainian refugees in Warsaw earlier in the day.

US and Ukrainian officials meet: Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said he feels ""cautious optimism"" following his meeting with US counterpart Lloyd Austin, Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Poland on Saturday. The United States has made assurances that there will be additional defense support for Ukraine, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said.

The US will provide “an additional $100 million in civilian security assistance"" to Ukraine, Blinken said in a statement later Saturday.

Russia signaled a possible recalibration of its war aims in Ukraine on Friday as the Kremlin faced spreading global ostracism for the brutal invasion, hardened Western economic punishments and a determined Ukrainian resistance that appeared to be making some gains on the ground.

A statement by Russia’s Defense Ministry said the goals of the “first stage of the operation” had been “mainly accomplished,” with Ukraine’s combat capabilities “significantly reduced,” and that it would now focus on securing Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, where Russia-backed separatists have been fighting for eight years.

The Defense Ministry statement was ambiguous about further possible Russian territorial ambitions in Ukraine, where its ground forces have been mostly stymied by the unexpectedly strong Ukrainian military response.

But on a day when President Biden was visiting U.S. soldiers in Poland near the Ukrainian border, the statement suggested the possibility that the Russians were looking for a way to salvage some kind of achievement before the costs of the war they launched a month ago became impossibly onerous.

While Russia “does not exclude” that its forces will storm major Ukrainian cities such as Chernihiv, Mykolaiv and the capital, Kyiv, the Defense Ministry statement said that taking them over was not the primary objective.

“As individual units carry out their tasks — and they are being solved successfully — our forces and means will be concentrated on the main thing: the complete liberation of the Donbas,” Col. Gen. Sergei Rudskoi, a senior Russian military commander, said in the statement, his first since Russia’s invasion on Feb. 24.

Whether General Rudskoi’s statement was sincere or simply strategic misdirection was difficult to assess. But the statement amounted to the most direct acknowledgment yet that Russia may be unable to take full control of Ukraine and would instead target the Donbas region, where Russia has recognized the independence of two Kremlin-backed separatist areas that it calls the “Donetsk People’s Republic” and the “Luhansk People’s Republic.”

Russia has also insisted that Ukraine recognize its control of Crimea, which President Vladimir V. Putin’s forces seized from Ukraine in 2014.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has ruled out ceding those regions to stop the war.

Pavel Luzin, a Russian military analyst, cautioned that the public pronouncements of Russian military commanders should be regarded skeptically. While Russia could indeed be narrowing its war aims, he said, General Rudskoi’s statement could also be a feint as Russia regroups for a new offensive.

“We could say that this is a signal that we’re no longer insisting on dismantling Ukrainian statehood,” Mr. Luzin said. “But I would rather see it as a distracting maneuver.”

General Rudskoi’s statement came as Ukraine acknowledged that Russian forces had been “partially successful” in achieving one of their key objectives — securing a land corridor from Russia to the Crimean Peninsula.

While Russia already controlled much of the area, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said the route allowed Russian troops and supplies to flow between Crimea and Russia.

But some Ukrainian officials said the significance of such a route might be overstated. Oleksandr Danylyuk, a former secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine under Mr. Zelensky, described the land bridge as a minor Russian victory and said the Kremlin was moving to secure Donetsk and Luhansk to “sell to the Russian public as a potential victory.”

In Moscow, Mr. Putin, who has made any criticism of the war a potential crime, used a televised videoconference with the winners of a presidential arts prize on Friday to deliver a diatribe about “cancel culture” that made no mention of the war in Ukraine.

In embracing a term that has become a favorite of the American political right to reprise his contention that the West is trying to erase Russian culture and history, Mr. Putin cited J.K. Rowling, author of the “Harry Potter” books, whose comments about transgender women have been criticized as transphobic.

“Not so long ago, the children’s writer J.K. Rowling was also ‘canceled’ for the fact that she — the author of books that have sold hundreds of millions of copies around the world — did not please fans of so-called gender freedoms,” Mr. Putin said.

Ms. Rowling responded on Twitter that, “Critiques of Western cancel culture are possibly not best made by those currently slaughtering civilians for the crime of resistance, or who jail and poison their critics.” She added the hashtag #IStandWithUkraine.

As Mr. Putin spoke, there were indications that Ukrainian forces were making some progress in the second week of their counteroffensive. A senior Pentagon official said that Russian forces no longer had full control of the southern port of Kherson and that the city, the first major urban center to be captured in the Russian invasion, was now “contested territory.”

The Pentagon assessment contradicted General Rudskoi’s claim on Friday that the Kherson region was “under full control.”

In another sign of the bloody stalemate in Ukraine, Russian soldiers have adopted “defensive positions” near Kyiv, the Pentagon official said, adding that Russia appeared to be “prioritizing” the fight in eastern Ukraine, as General Rudskoi had indicated.

“Clearly, they overestimated their ability to take Kyiv and overestimated their ability to take any population center,” the Pentagon official said.

Mr. Biden, on the second day of his three-day visit to Europe because of the Ukraine crisis, traveled to Rzeszow, Poland, about 50 miles from the Ukrainian border, where he met with members of the 82nd Airborne Division who are serving as part of NATO’s efforts to protect Poland and other member states from Russian aggression.

Greeting American service members who were eating pizza in a cafeteria, Mr. Biden called them “the finest fighting force in the history of the world,” and added, “I personally thank you for what you do.”

Later, Mr. Biden met with President Andrzej Duda of Poland and officials managing the humanitarian response to the more than two million Ukrainian refugees who have fled to Poland to escape the shelling and deprivation.

Mr. Biden also announced a deal to increase U.S. shipments of natural gas to help wean Europe off Russian energy. But it remained unclear exactly how the administration would achieve its goals.

The deal calls for the United States to send an additional 15 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas — roughly 10 to 12 percent of current annual U.S. exports to all countries. But it does not address the lack of port capacity to ship and receive more gas on both sides of the Atlantic.

Still, American gas executives welcomed a renewed emphasis on exports as a sign that the Biden administration was now seeking to promote the U.S. oil and gas industry rather than punish it for contributions to climate change.

“I have no idea how they are going to do this, but I don’t want to criticize them because for the first time they are trying to do the right thing,” said Charif Souki, executive chairman of Tellurian, a U.S. gas producer that is planning to build an export terminal in Louisiana.

Robert Habeck, the vice chancellor and economic minister of Germany, said his country expected to halve imports of Russian oil by midsummer and nearly end them by year’s end — sooner than many thought possible. He estimated that Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, could be free of Russian gas by mid-2024.

Images and videos from Ukraine that emerged on Friday underscored the escalating death toll and destruction.

Newly surfaced security camera footage, verified by The New York Times, showed an attack on people in line for emergency aid outside a post office and shopping center in the battered northeastern city of Kharkiv on Thursday. Oleg Sinegubov, the head of the regional government there, said that at least six civilians had been killed and 15 wounded.

Photographs out of Kharkiv on Friday also showed a large fireball and nearby cars and buildings on fire, as residents fled on foot and bicycle, carrying whatever belongings they could grab in the aftermath of the attack.

In the central city of Dnipro, Russian missile strikes on a military facility destroyed buildings late Thursday night, according to Ukrainian officials, who said that casualties were still being assessed.

And in Mariupol, the southern port savaged by Russian attacks, Ukrainian officials said that an estimated 300 people had been killed in a March 16 strike on a theater used as a bomb shelter.

It was unclear how officials had arrived at that estimate. Ukrainian officials have said that about 130 people were rescued from the theater, which was attacked even though “children” had been written in giant letters on the pavement on both sides of the building.

The United Nations said on Friday that more than 1,000 civilians have been killed, including 93 children, since Russia’s invasion began, many in what appeared to have been indiscriminate bombardments that could constitute war crimes.

The United Nations cautioned that it had not been able to verify the death toll in areas of intense conflict, including Mariupol, and said the actual number of injured and dead was likely to be considerably higher.

In a sign that diplomatic efforts were struggling, Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, rejected comments by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, who had suggested that Ukraine was open to concessions in four key areas.

In an interview released Friday, Mr. Erdogan, who is hosting talks between Ukrainian and Russian delegations, said that Ukraine was willing to drop its bid for NATO membership, accept Russian as an official language, make “certain concessions” about disarmament and agree to “collective security.”

But Mr. Kuleba said the negotiations had proved “very difficult” and that Ukraine had “taken a strong position and does not relinquish its demands.”

“We insist, first of all, on a cease-fire, security guarantees and territorial integrity of Ukraine,” he said, adding that there was “no consensus with Russia on the four points mentioned by the president of Turkey.”

“In particular,” he said, “the Ukrainian language is and will be the only one state language in Ukraine.”

As Russians continue to carry out strikes on Ukrainian cities, the country's residents are evacuating their homes and taking cover in subway cars, basements and bomb shelters.

The displacement of millions across Ukraine a little over a month into the invasion is evident in photos of sliced-open apartment buildings, dogs in arms and children's belongings left behind.

STORYLINE:

On April 23rd 2014 commanding officer Jan-Kjetil Folland gives the order for ""battle stations"" on board the Norwegian NATO flagship the Valkyrien.

An alarm sounds and gunfire from a .50 calibre machine gun echoes over the waters of the Baltic Sea.

April 23rd's simulated ""battle stations"" exercises are part of a ""show of strength"" deployment for eastern members of the alliance.

Five battleships took part in the exercises, and crew members fired weapons off the deck of the Valkyrien - the flagship of the Standing NATO Mine Counter-Measures Group ONE.

Lieutenant Commander Dave Benham, NATO's chief public affairs officer, said that the group's deployment is ""one of those measures designed to assure our allies in the Baltic of NATO's resolve and solidarity and preparedness to meet any challenge"".

The exercises come amid the West's ongoing dispute with Russia over Ukraine.

Ukraine's ousted president, Viktor Yanukovych, said on April 2nd that he was ""wrong"" to invite Russian troops into Crimea, and vowed to try to persuade Russia to return the Black Sea peninsula.

In his first interview since fleeing to Russia in February 2014, Yanukovych told The Associated Press and Russia's state NTV television that he still hopes to negotiate with Russian President Vladimir Putin to get back the coveted region.

Russia annexed Crimea in March following a hastily called referendum held after Russian troops took control of the region.

Ukraine and the West have rejected the move as illegal.

""Crimea is a tragedy. It is a great tragedy,"" Yanukovych told The AP, insisting that Russia's takeover of Crimea wouldn't have happened if he had stayed in power.

He fled Ukraine after three months of anti-government protests against his rule.

The 63-year-old said he has personally met with Putin since he arrived and hopes to have more meetings with the Russian leader to negotiate Crimea's return.

On April 7th Pro-Russian protesters set tyres and plastic barriers on fire in front of the regional assembly building in Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine.

The building was seized by separatists after demonstrations on Sunday but the Ukrainian police have since regained control.

Earlier on April 7th pro-Russia and pro-Ukraine demonstrators clashed in front of the regional assembly building and police struggled to keep the two groups apart as sticks and stones were thrown by protesters on both sides.

Eastern Ukraine was the heartland of support for President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Russia after months of protests.

About half of the region's residents are ethnic Russians, many of whom say Ukraine's acting authorities are nationalists who will oppress Russians.

***

On April 16th tension was high in the eastern Ukrainian city of Slovyansk as pro-Russia armed militia patrolled the streets.

One man was seen being punched and kicked by unidentified assailants. He was later led away by members of the pro-Russia militia.

Dozens of masked gunmen, backed with at least six armoured vehicles waving Russian flags, surrounded the main administrative building in Slovyansk.

The troops were enthusiastically greeted in the largely pro-Russian city.

""We've managed to defeat fascism back in 1945 and they wanted us to forget about this triumph. But we don't want to forgive or forget,"" said one man.

He said they came from Crimea to help the people of Donbas region, where Slovyansk is located.

Armed men in Slovyansk have seized the local police headquarters and the administration building, demanding broader autonomy for their eastern Ukraine region and closer ties with Russia.

Their actions have been repeated in at least eight other cities in eastern Ukraine.

Eastern Ukraine was the support base for ousted President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Russia after months of protests over his decision to back away from closer relations with the European Union and turn toward Russia.

Opponents of the government that replaced him allege the new authorities will repress eastern Ukraine's large Russian-speaking population.

On April 17th the Prime Minister of Ukraine accused Russia of orchestrating unrest in eastern Ukraine.

Arseniy Yatsenyuk was addressing journalists following a meeting between Ukrainian ministers and business representatives in Kiev.

""There is only one person in the world who believes that Russian troops are not present in the east of Ukraine. This person is Vladimir Putin,"" Yatsenyuk said.

He added that despite admitting that Russian troops had been involved in a military intervention in Crimea, Putin was denying that ""saboteurs"" who had ""created a terrorist network on Ukraine territory"" were following his orders.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on April 17th rejected claims that Russian special forces are fomenting unrest in eastern Ukraine, but recognised for the first time that the troops in unmarked uniforms who overtook Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula before its annexation by Moscow were Russian soldiers.

The well-armed, Moscow-backed insurgency sowing chaos in eastern Ukraine scored a new victory on Wednesday, seizing armoured vehicles and weapons from underequipped government forces, then rolling through two cities to a hero's welcome.

Meanwhile, officials from the US, Russia, Ukraine and the European Union were meeting in Geneva on Thursday for negotiations aimed at persuading Russia to back off in Ukraine following its annexation of Crimea.

Yatsenyuk said he did not have ""exaggerated expectations"" of the Geneva talks.

On May 2nd pro-Russians clashed with Ukrainian government supporters in the Black Sea port city of Odessa.

Supporters of the government in Kiev armed themselves with rocks and other projectiles.

Police tried to separate both sets of demonstrators.

Police said one person died from gunshot fire and another was wounded.

Odessa is some 550 kilometres (330 miles) from the turmoil in Ukraine's east.

It has remained largely untroubled by unrest since the February toppling of pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych, which ignited tensions in the east.

***

On May 11th almost 90 percent of voters in a key industrial region in eastern Ukraine voted in favour of sovereignty, according to pro-Russian separatists as they announced preliminary results of a twin referendum that is certain to deepen the turmoil in the country.

Roman Lyagin, election chief of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, said around 75 percent of the Donetsk region's 3 million or so voters cast ballots, and the vast majority backed sovereignty.

With no international election monitors in place, it was all but impossible to verify the claims.

Lyagin said they understood the outcome would fall on deaf ears, but that the people of Donetsk have spoken.

""European organisations and international governments will not recognise it, but through this referendum we want everyone to listen to us and the power of the people.""

The preliminary vote count was announced just two hours after the polls closed in an election conducted via paper ballots.

A second referendum that was also organised by pro-Russian separatists was held in eastern Ukraine's industrial Luhansk region, but no immediate results were released.

Ukraine's central government and the West had condemned the balloting as a sham and a violation of international law.

They have accused Moscow of orchestrating the unrest in a possible attempt to grab another piece of the country weeks after the annexation of Crimea.

The results of the two referendums could hasten the break-up of the country and worsen what is already the gravest crisis between the West and Russia since the end of the Cold War.

On May 22nd at least eleven Ukrainian troops were killed and about 30 others were wounded when pro-Russian insurgents attacked a military checkpoint, the deadliest raid in weeks of fighting in eastern Ukraine.

AP journalists saw 11 bodies scattered around the checkpoint on the edge of the village of Blahodatne, about 30 kilometres (20 miles) south of the city of Donetsk.

Witnesses said that more than 30 Ukrainian troops were wounded when the insurgents attacked the checkpoint, and some of them were in grave condition.

""Three of my friends have fallen, and I cannot even collect their bodies. Their combat unit has been lying there in the field for over 30 minutes already,"" said one Ukrainian soldier standing just metres away from the scene.

The attack came three days before the country's presidential vote.

Three charred Ukrainian armoured infantry vehicles, their turrets blown away by powerful explosions, and several burned trucks stood at the site of the combat area. A military helicopter landed on the site, carrying officials who inspected the scene.

The Ukrainian Defence Ministry confirmed the attack, but wouldn't comment on casualties. There was no report of casualties on the insurgent side.

""At first the vehicles came and cleared (destroyed) the scene. After that, the helicopters cleaned what was left of the place"", said a paramedic, standing outside the local Volnovakha hospital.

The Volnovakha hospital was closed to the media, as Ukrainian soldiers rushed in and out, and guarded the entrances.

In the town of Horlivka, a rebel commander claimed responsibility for the raid and produced an array of weapons they said they had seized.

Scores have been killed in fighting between pro-Russian insurgents, who have seized government buildings and engaged in clashes with government troops in eastern Ukraine.

May 22nd's carnage cast a shadow over Ukraine's presidential vote on May 25th, which insurgents in the east have pledged to derail.

US President Barack Obama said on June 4th that the Ukrainian people had made a ""wise selection"" in electing their new leader.

Obama was speaking during a meeting with Ukraine's President-elect Petro Poroshenko in Warsaw, Poland.

He said he had been ""deeply impressed"" with Poroshenko's vision, and called on the international community to support Poroshenko in his efforts.

Obama described recent events in Ukraine as an ""incredible outpouring of democracy in the face of actions by Russia, as well as armed militias in certain portions of the East"" and said the US was committed to standing behind Ukraine.

In tandem with June 4th's meeting, the US announced it would send Kiev an additional 5 million US dollars in equipment, as Ukraine's military continues to suffer casualties in its confrontation with pro-Russian insurgents, especially in the country's east.

More significant than the dollar amount was the nature of the new aid, with the White House saying for the first time that the assistance would include body armour and night vision goggles: tools that could directly help Ukraine's troops as they battle separatists.

Until now, the US has only provided other nonlethal forms of aid such as clothes, food and radios.

On June 7th Ukraine's new president attended a ceremony in central Kiev after taking the oath of office at Ukraine's parliament in the morning.

Petro Poroshenko was greeted by an honour guard at St Sophia Square in the capital as crowds waved national flags and cheered for their new leader.

The 48-year-old Poroshenko replaces an interim leader who had been in office since Russia-friendly president Viktor Yanukovych fled the country in February.

Poroshenko assumed power a day after meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin at D-Day commemoration ceremonies in France.

On June 13th Ukrainian government troops, reinforced by volunteers from a paramilitary battalion, fought pro-Russia separatists in the southern port of Mariupol, Ukraine's interior minister said.

Arsen Avakov said that four government troops were wounded as forces retook buildings occupied by the rebels in the centre of the city and that troops destroyed a light armoured vehicle used by the separatists.

About a hundred members of the Azov Battalion militia forces, controlled by Kiev were seen at the scene of clashes, singing the national anthem, cheering and shouting ""Azov, Azov"", as they were leaving the scene in military trucks.

Remnants of a destroyed and burned out military truck and APC were seen at the spot where the heaviest fight took place.

The APC had DNR sprayed on it, which is the abbreviation for the Donetsk People's Republic in Russian.

The renewed fighting came as rebel leaders confirmed they have three tanks.

Ukrainian officials have said the tanks crossed from the Russian side of the porous border and were attacked by Ukrainian troops, but there has been no independent confirmation the tanks came from Russia.

As a shaky cease-fire in the east entered its final hours on June 26th, thousands of Ukrainians in cars stuffed with their belongings lined up at the border to cross into Russia, some vowing never to return.

Many of them queued at the Izvaryne crossing, their cars laden with household items, including refrigerators.

One local commander at a rebel-controlled border post outside the city of Luhansk said 5,000 people had left by evening, joining a stream that has continued unabated during the weeklong truce that has failed to end the gunfire and shelling.

""It's scary. We are afraid for the kid,"" said a young woman called Anastasia, who had come to the border with her husband and small child.

Russia says tens of thousands of Ukrainians have arrived in the two and a half months since Ukraine's government began fighting separatists in the east, a heavily industrial region with a large population of ethnic Russians, many of whom feel strong ties to Moscow.

Air strikes and artillery attacks by the Ukrainian military have killed more than 400 people since mid-April, according to a United Nations estimate.

The fleeing Ukrainians who talked to the Associated Press did not indicate whether or not they supported the armed separatists, who have seized government buildings, declared independence and asked Russia to annex the region.

""We don't have any relatives in Russia, only friends. We are going to claim refugee status and then it depends on how the Russian Federation treats us,"" said Dimitriy, who was waiting in his car to cross into Russia.

Russia's migration service said last week that it had registered the arrival of 90,000 Ukrainians, but few asked for refugee status, which would oblige them to stay in Russia at least six months.",http://www.aparchive.com/clipbin/AB29CD4CB135B1343137B3AC4903320D8D4D0CCD8C01
