According to the US officials, the decoys possess the ability to use two kinds of countermeasures to missile defense: a jammer that disrupts radar-frequency and a strong heat source to spoof infrared-guided interceptors.

A Russian military spokesperson claimed that up to 180 “foreign mercenaries and a large consignment of foreign weapons” were destroyed in the attack.

The Drive: With Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine going far from as was expected, statements made today by Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister, Sergey Ryabkov, have officially put the U.S. and its allies on notice that any weapons shipments into Ukraine will be viewed as legitimate targets and potentially attacked as such. “We warned the United States that the orchestrated pumping of weapons from a number of countries is not just a dangerous move, it is a move that turns these convoys into legitimate targets,” Ryabkov told state television. He went on, warning “about the consequences of the thoughtless transfer to Ukraine of weapons like man-portable air defense systems, anti-tank missile systems, and so on.” So far, arms shipments into Ukraine have gone on without much interference. It is understood that they occur almost exclusively over land, but it appears Ukrainian airlifters have been involved, as well, at least earlier in the war. U.S. officials and President Zelensky had commented in the past that these supply lines have remained open, which have been a critical lifeline for Ukraine’s defense. In recent days, shipments have sped up, with the U.S., in particular, pushing as much materiel into the country as it can, likely out of concern that Russia could soon move to more actively interdict the shipments.

US News: Russian President Vladimir Putin has now committed nearly all the forces he had amassed on the borders of Ukraine in the lead-up to Russia’s invasion, but a lack of advance on the ground in recent days has led to increased bombardment of several Ukrainian cities from the air. Beyond southern areas of Ukraine, the Russian troops have not made “a lot of progress, at least over the course of the last couple of days,” a senior U.S. defense official told reporters on background Monday. Even so, Russia has now launched more than 625 missiles at Ukraine – with cities such as Kharkiv and the capital of Kyiv getting hit especially hard, according to the Pentagon. “It appears as though the Russians are increasing their use of long-range fires to supplement or to make up for the lack of ground movements that they have had and the lack of air superiority that they don’t enjoy,” the official added, noting that the air space above Ukraine is still contested.

Associated Press: The humanitarian crisis in Ukraine deepened Monday as Russian forces intensified their shelling and food, water, heat and medicine grew increasingly scarce, in what the country condemned as a medieval-style siege by Moscow to batter it into submission. A third round of talks between the two sides ended with a top Ukrainian official saying there had been minor, unspecified progress toward establishing safe corridors that would allow civilians to escape the fighting. Russia’s chief negotiator said he expects those corridors to start operating Tuesday. But that remained to be seen, given the failure of previous attempts to lead civilians to safety amid the biggest ground war in Europe since World War II.

The Week: Since the start of its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, Russia has fired 600 missiles, a senior U.S. defense official told CNN on Sunday. About 95 percent of Russia’s amassed combat power is now inside Ukraine, the official said, with Russian troops fighting Ukrainian forces in Kherson and Mykolaiv and attempting to encircle Kyiv, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, and Mariupol. At this time, the official added, it’s believed that “the Ukrainian people in most parts of the country still have means of communication, access to internet and the media.” The official also told CNN the skies above Kyiv are contested and there are no indications that an amphibious assault near Odessa is imminent. When asked about claims that Russian forces are firing on protesters in Kyiv, the official said they could not corroborate the reports.

Politico: Russian forces intensified shelling of cities in Ukraine’s center, north and south, a Ukrainian official said, as a second attempt to evacuate besieged civilians collapsed. With the Ukrainian leader urging his people to take to the streets to fight, Russian President Vladimir Putin shifted blame for the invasion, saying Moscow’s attacks could be halted “only if Kyiv ceases hostilities.” The outskirts of Kyiv, Chernihiv in the north, Mykolaiv in the south, and Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city, faced stepped-up shelling late Sunday, presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovich said. Heavy artillery hit residential areas in Kharkiv and shelling damaged a television tower, according to local officials. The attacks dashed hopes that more people could escape the fighting in Ukraine, where Russia’s plan to quickly overrun the country has been stymied by fierce resistance. Russia has made significant advances in southern Ukraine and along the coast, but many of its efforts have become stalled, including an immense military convoy that has been almost motionless for days north of Kyiv.
