OCHAKIV, Ukraine — Two explosions rocked the port of Ochakiv around 7 a.m. on Thursday, as Russian forces unleashed a fierce assault on a Ukrainian naval base President Vladimir Putin had personally griped about as a symbol of NATO’s encroachment into Moscow’s historic sphere of influence.

Within minutes, the waterfront area was blanketed in thick smoke and Base А2637, the naval installation and radar station, was engulfed in flames. At least four soldiers were seriously wounded in the blasts, the regional governor, Vitaliy Kim, said. He added that the number of casualties was certain to rise.

Ochakiv has been an important, strategic naval base for centuries — known for being the site of a major battle of the Russo-Turkish war that began in May 1788. The city, then held by the Turks, was called Özi Kuşatması.

Russian forces led by Prince Grigory Potemkin and General Alexander Suvorov laid siege to the city. They ultimately conquered it with the help of the Scottish-American naval commander, John Paul Jones, who had accepted a commission as an admiral from Empress Catherine II.

On Monday, some 234 years later, in his rambling, paranoid and gripe-laden speech recognizing two breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine as independent, Putin claimed that Ochakiv was key to United States and NATO plans to turn Ukraine into a staging ground for attacks against Russia.

“The United States and NATO have begun the shameless development of the territory of Ukraine as a theater of potential military operations,” Putin said. “Regular joint exercises have a clear anti-Russian focus.”

“With the appearance of weapons of mass destruction in Ukraine, the situation in the world, in Europe, especially for us, for Russia, will change in the most radical way,” Putin added, though Ukraine surrendered its nuclear arsenal to Russia in 1994.

Later, he turned his attention to Ochakiv, a city of fewer than 14,000 about an hour’s drive from the regional capital of Mykolayiv, whose population has been declining for years.

“I will add that the Naval Operations Center in Ochakov, built by the Americans, makes it possible to ensure the actions of NATO ships, including the use of high-precision weapons by them against the Russian Black Sea Fleet and our infrastructure along the entire Black Sea coast,” Putin said, using the Russian name for the city. He also complained that the Ochakiv base would be used to monitor Russian military forces stationed in Crimea, the annexed Ukrainian peninsula located fewer than 100 kilometers away.

But what Putin described as if it was a highly sophisticated naval complex, was in fact — like most Ukrainian military outposts following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 — badly depleted and dilapidated, according to the local commander. It had undergone only a modest upgrade with U.S. financial help, mainly to house five small Willard-model military speed boats and to accommodate NATO vessels participating in joint Black Sea exercises.

“It’s absolutely not a NATO base,” the commander, Captain Vitaliy Kharchenko, said in a brief interview outside his headquarters on Wednesday.

Kharchenko confirmed the widely available public information that “U.S. forces built several buildings here.” Among them are the so-called Maritime Operations Center, which he described as “a small building of 10 meters by 30 meters,” a boat maintenance facility and a building to store the five Willards, which Ukrainian media described as intended for use by special forces on stealthy missions.

Kharchenko noted that his base would be no match for Russia’s enormous military arsenal. On Thursday morning, the base felt the force of that arsenal, becoming one of the opening targets in the first wide-scale military invasion on the European continent since World War II.

Other navy, army and air force bases were similarly attacked all across Ukraine, including in the Western part of the country, far from the eastern Donbass region where Ukrainian forces have spent years clashing with Russian-backed separatists.

Kharchenko, like many Ukrainians, said he believed that Putin was a madman.

“If someone is schizophrenic, he can even use nuclear weapons,” the captain said. “Nobody can stop him.”

Asked what the West might do to help, Kharchenko suggested supplying more weapons given Ukraine’s limited manufacturing capabilities. “We need more time to develop our own weapons,” he said.

On the day before the start of the war, life proceeded as normal in downtown Ochakiv.

Military personnel, who make up as much as one-third of the local population, could be seen throughout the city, strolling in uniform. The local market, redolent of smoked fish, was open for business, with stalls selling everything from vegetables to fishing gear as well as underwear and other apparel.

“Everybody of course is afraid of war,” said Nataliya Pishuk, the editor of Black Sea Star, which is now the only local newspaper left in Ochakiv. “We’re a military town.” Pishuk said residents were also concerned about the economic situation, which has deteriorated throughout the coronavirus pandemic.

Anna Belaya, the local librarian, said she took note of the Americans who arrived in town two summers ago to help work on the base. “There were 10 or 12, maybe 15 of them,” she said. “Builders, young guys. They were running every morning. Every day I saw them. They were physically fit.”

She said they did not appear to be military men, but construction workers. In addition to their work by the port, they had also helped renovate a children’s playground, a local school and a kindergarten.

“They didn’t have any conflicts,” Belaya said. “They had good contacts with residents of the city.”

Belaya dismissed the allegations that they had constructed a NATO base, and said it had been years since she had seen any Americans in town. “It’s nonsense,” she said. “If there would be a base, we will see the military.”

Nonsense or not, Russia has been complaining about NATO’s increased activity in and around Ochakiv for at least five years, as the U.S. Naval Institute, a think tank noted in a 2019 blog post. In 2017, for example, the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies published an article about Ukraine’s military aspirations titled: “Ukraine’s ‘Funny Fleet’ Goes to NATO Standards.”

Putin, his military advisers and his close associates weren’t laughing, however.

“We’ll drown you there, in the Black Sea, and we will destroy the Kyiv government; this is Russian land — Ochakiv,” Vladimir Zhirinovsky, an ultra-right-wing politician said in an August 2017 speech to the State Duma, Russia’s lower house of parliament.

“Your Americans will die, we will destroy them all, shoot them and hang you all. You vile creatures,” added Zhirinovsky, who has run for president several times as part of Russia’s “loyal opposition.” In December, Zhirinovsky predicted the invasion of Ukraine, practically to the hour, saying that the world would change on February 22 at 4 a.m. In fact, it turned out to be February 24, shortly after 4 a.m. Moscow time.

Putin, in his speech on Monday, reached all the way back to the Siege of Ochakov in 1788 to lay claim to the city. He said the U.S. had wanted to establish a similar naval center in Crimea but that this was blocked by Russia’s invasion and annexation of the peninsula in 2014.

“The Crimeans and Sevastopol thwarted these plans; we will always remember this,” Putin said, while also insisting that the plans were recreated at the new center in Ochakiv.

“I repeat, today such a center has been deployed, it has already been deployed in Ochakov,” he said, before offering a history lesson. “Let me remind you that in the 18th century the soldiers of Alexander Suvorov fought for this city. Thanks to their courage, it became part of Russia.”

“Now,” he added, “they are trying to consign these milestones of history to oblivion, as well as the names of state military figures of the Russian Empire, without whose work modern Ukraine would not have many large cities and even the very exit to the Black Sea.”

Putin continued: “Recently, a monument to Alexander Suvorov was demolished in Poltava. What can you say? Renounce your own past? From the so-called colonial heritage of the Russian Empire?”



“Training missions of NATO countries are deployed in Ukraine,” Putin said. “These, in fact, are already foreign military bases.”

But it takes only a day-long visit to Ochakiv to find that Putin’s revanchist fantasies are not only dangerous but historically inaccurate. Although the residents are predominantly Russian-speaking, they self-identify as citizens of Ukraine, and ethnically the population is mixed. Asked if she considered herself Ukrainian or Russian, a woman working at the local history museum laughed. “I’m Moldovan,” said.

Andrei Kurkov, an acclaimed Ukrainian novelist who writes in Russian and whose books include “The Gardener from Ochakov,” said that the city had enjoyed a rich, colorful backstory, as well as shared in the suffering common throughout the former Soviet Union.

“In fact, if you are trying to tune to radio, even FM, first of all, you will listen to Romanian and Moldovan music and radio stations,” Kurkov said in a telephone interview from Kyiv, where he lives. “They reach very easily the Ochakov peninsula.”

“On the coastline and in the south, it’s a mixture of ethnic groups and nationalities,” he said.

Ochakiv’s fate, like that of all of Ukraine, is now uncertain. Residents on Thursday reported continued explosions. “We hear things falling,” said one resident, who was too frightened to give her name. Like every military town, the residents are terrified both for their homes and their loved ones in uniform.

Turkish, Russian or Ukrainian, it has been a military town for centuries.

“For me, it’s a magic town with lots of stories,” Kurkov said. “In Soviet times, it was a very happy place that nobody could enter without permission because it was a secret town with an army base and a navy base.”

Once the Soviet Union collapsed, he said: “The town immediately became very poor, shabby and forgotten, with lots of people with strong nostalgia for the Soviet past.”

“It’s still a shabby state,” he added. “They were dreaming of reviving the resort and making it popular again, but they didn’t have enough money to turn the Soviet rest houses into something more modern.”

“I think,” the Ukraine author who writes in Russian said in English: “The nostalgia is gone for many years.”

Russian forces have seized control of Chernobyl nuclear power plant after a 'fierce' battle, with the condition of nuclear storage facilities 'unknown', sparking fears of a radiation leak that could cause fallout in Europe.

Video revealed Russian tanks and armoured vehicles standing in front of the destroyed reactor, which sits just 60 miles north of the capital Kiev.

An official said Russian shelling hit a radioactive waste repository and an increase in radiation levels was reported, although this has not yet been corroborated.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said it is following the situation in Ukraine 'with grave concern' and appealed for maximum restraint to avoid any action that may put Ukraine's nuclear facilities at risk.

Ukrainian presidential advisor Myhailo Podolyak said: 'After the absolutely senseless attack of the Russians in this direction, it is impossible to say that the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is safe.'

Meanwhile Turkey reported that one of its ships had been hit by a 'bomb' off the coast of Odessa, where fighting is also going on. Turkey is a member of NATO, underlining fears that the war in Ukraine could quickly suck in other states and spark an all-out conflict in Europe.

Speaking after the latest developments, Joe Biden announced more sanctions against Russia but admitted that he had not expected previous threats of financial penalties to deter Vladimir Putin.

He also resisted calls to send in US troops to Ukraine, saying he has no plans to speak to the Russian leader who he accuses of trying to rebuild a Soviet empire.

The sanctions will target Russian banks, oligarchs, state-controlled companies and high-tech sectors, but Russian oil and natural gas were exempt in a bid to avoid disruption to global markets.

'Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences,' Biden said in remarks at the White House.

Elsewhere, Kiev ordered civilians into bomb shelters and declared a curfew amid concerns Russia is about to strike the capital as Ukrainian troops lost control of a key airfield around 15 miles away. Russian forces had attacked it with around two dozen attack helicopters earlier in the day, four of which are thought to have been shot down.

'They are going to bomb Kyiv now. Authorities told us to hide in shelters,' a source in the city told MailOnline as authorities said a hospital had been hit, killing four people.

The Ukrainian army was this afternoon fighting in almost every region of the country, battling the Russians for control of military bases, airports, cities and ports from Kharkiv to Kiev, and Donetsk to Odessa.

It came after Vladimir Putin personally gave the order to attack around 5am, unleashing a salvo of rocket fire that American intelligence said involved more than 100 short and medium-range ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and surface-to-air missiles, and 75 bombers that targeted military sites including barracks, warehouses and airfields in order to knock out the country's military command structure.

Russia said the strikes destroyed 74 Ukrainian military ground facilities, 11 airfields, three command posts and 18 radar stations controlling Kiev's anti-aircraft batteries.

That was followed by attacks from Crimea in the south towards the city of Kherson, a northern advance from Belarus to Kiev, and an eastern advance from Belgorod towards Kharkiv where the heaviest fighting is going on.

American officials said this was merely an 'initial phase' of the attack, and that the majority of Russia's 190,000 troops at the front remain in reserve. The goal of the attack is to 'take key population centres' and 'decapitate the Ukrainian government', the officials added.

Ukraine's health ministry said so far 57 people have been killed on the first day of conflict, while 169 have been wounded.

The port cities of Mariupol and Odessa, where Ukraine's main naval bases are located, were also attacked - though Odessa appeared to remain under Ukrainian control as of Thursday afternoon. Russian tankers blockaded the Kerch Strait, leading from the Back Sea to the Sea of Azov, cutting off Mariupol.

Ukraine has hit back, shooting down five Russian helicopters, destroying dozens of tanks and capturing Russian troops.

A Russian AN-26 military transport aircraft also crashed in the southern Voronezh region, killing its crew on board.

The accident could have been caused by a technical failure and has not inflicted any damage on the ground, Interfax said, citing a press office of Russia's western military district.

Volodymyr Zelensky, in an address to the nation on Thursday evening, described Russia as 'evil' and said Putin had attacked 'like a suicidal scoundrel... just as Fascist Germany did in World War II'.

'Ukraine will not surrender its freedom, whatever Moscow thinks,' he added. 'For Ukrainians independence and the right to live free on our land is the highest value.'

He had earlier called on all Ukrainian citizens willing to defend their homeland to step forward, saying guns will be issued to everyone who wants one. He also asked for civilians to give blood to help wounded troops. And he asked world leaders to impose the 'harshest sanctions possible' on Putin.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, addressing the nation at midday, said western allies are preparing a 'massive' package of sanctions against Russia and told the people of Ukraine: 'We cannot and will not just look away.' Johnson referred to Putin as a 'dictator' who would never 'subdue the national feeling of the Ukrainians'.

As the West prepared to cut off Russia financially, Vladimir Putin summoned his oligarchs to demand loyalty over his attack on Ukraine - perhaps fearing a rebellion from within after prominent Russian TV figures and celebrities spoke out to oppose the conflict.

Speaking in the Kremlin, he said that Russia had been 'forced' to take action over Ukraine and had 'no other choice' but to attack, saying the country remains 'part of the global economy' and that he 'will not hurt the system we belong to'. 'I want you to show solidarity with the government,' he told them.

The attack has come to Ukraine on all fronts with bombs and missiles dropped on targets across the country in the early hours, followed by troop attacks from Crimea, the Donbass, Belgorod and Belarus as well as helicopter landings in Kiev and at power plants on the Dnieper River. Chernobyl nuclear power plant has also fallen to Russian forces

UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELINSKIY 'Russia treacherously attacked our state in the morning, as Nazi Germany did in the WW2 years. 'As of today, our countries are on different sides of world history. Russia has embarked on a path of evil, but Ukraine is defending itself & won't give up its freedom no matter what Moscow thinks.' NATO SECRETARY-GENERAL JENS STOLTENBERG 'This is a deliberate, cold-blooded and long-planned invasion...

EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT URSULA VON DER LEYEN 'President Putin is responsible for bringing war back to Europe... 'We will target strategic sectors of the Russian economy by blocking their access to key technologies and markets. We will weaken Russia's economic base and its capacity to modernise.' 'In addition, we will freeze Russian assets in the EU and stop the access of Russian banks to the European financial market.' EUROPEAN COMMISSION FOREIGN POLICY CHIEF JOSEP BORRELL 'These are among the darkest hours of Europe since the Second World War. 'The EU will respond in the strongest possible terms and agree on the harshest package of sanctions we have ever implemented.' GERMAN CHANCELLOR OLAF SCHOLZ 'Putin is bringing suffering and destruction to his direct neighbours, he is violating the sovereignty and borders of Ukraine. 'He is endangering the lives of countless innocent people (and)... the peace order on our continent. For all that there is no justification. This is Putin's war.' FRENCH PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON 'France strongly condemns the decision of Russia to start a war with Ukraine. Russia must immediately put an end to its military operations.' BRITISH PRIME MINISTER BORIS JOHNSON 'President Putin has chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction by launching this unprovoked attack on Ukraine... 'This is a catastrophe for our continent.'

The options we can offer the government in support of the (NATO)alliance are extremely limited... 'We have all seen it coming but were not able to get through with our arguments to draw the consequences after (Russia's) annexation of Crimea. This does not feel good. I am fed up with it.' TURKISH FOREIGN MINISTRY 'This attack is a grave violation of international law and poses a serious threat to the security of our region and the world.

It came after the Russian strongman gave an extraordinary address to the Russian nation - broadcast in the early hours during a UN meeting aimed at avoiding war - in which he declared a 'special military operation' to 'de-militarise' and 'de-Nazify' Ukraine in what amounted to a outright declaration of war. The video appeared to have been pre-recorded, around the same time as Putin's Monday address recognising Donbass as independent.

Putin also issued a chilling warning to any country thinking of coming to Ukraine's aid, vowing 'consequences greater than any you have faced in history'. 'I hope I have been heard,' he said.

The mood on the ground in Ukraine was mixed. Some showed incredible resolve - heading to work via train and road even as the bombs dropped. Elderly women in the city of Kharkiv, under heavy attack, gathered in the street to pray. But for others, the sight of Russian attack was too much. Highways out of Kiev clogged with cars as people fled, while refugees began crossing the borders into Poland and Slovakia.

One Ukrainian woman voiced the outrage of her nation today as she confronted heavily armed Russian soldiers and demanded to know what they were doing in her country.

The woman, wearing a headscarf, shouted at two of the invaders: 'What the f*** are you doing in our land?' while one of the embarrassed soldiers in Henichesk, a port city on the sea of Azov, tried to calm her.

She walked away, then called back: 'You should put sunflower seeds in your pockets so that they will grow on Ukranian land after you die.'

Speaking in an emergency White House press conference, Biden today called Putin a 'pariah' on the international stage and called on the West to stand up to the 'bully'.

But he insisted the US would not be helping Ukraine with troops.

He said: 'Our forces are not, and will not be, engaged in the conflict with Russia in Ukraine. Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our Nato allies and reassure those allies in the east.

'When the history of this era is written, Putin's choice to make a totally unjustifiable war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.

'He has much larger ambitions than Ukraine. He wants to, in fact, re-establish the former Soviet Union. That's what this is about.'

Meanwhile protesters in Moscow voiced their support for Ukraine as they chanted 'There is no war' outside Pushkinskaya Metro station in the Russian capital.

The invasion - a naked attempt to redraw the map of Europe by force - marks the most concerted attempt to up-end world order since the end of the Cold War, and risks sparking the bloodiest conflict in Europe since the end of the Second World War.

Underlining the gravity of the moment, Ukrainian Interior Ministry advisor Anton Herashchenko said: 'Starting today, the world has a new geopolitical reality. Either Ukraine and the world will stop the new Hitler now, or there will be a Third World War.'

Western leaders lined up to condemn Russia's actions in the early hours, with security councils convened the world over to mount a response. Heavy sanctions are expected to follow, along with more shipments of military equipment to Ukraine - provided they can find a route in.

But NATO and the US have made it clear that no troops will be sent, leaving Ukraine's military - far the inferior of Russia - to hold off the assault alone. Few expect it to emerge victorious from what is almost certain to be a prolonged, bloody, and vicious war.

NATO is expected to focus its efforts on stopping the war from spilling over into neighbouring countries. Poland, a member of the alliance, shares an extensive land border with Ukraine. The Baltic states - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, also NATO members - will now fear a Russian assault.

The alliance began moving its forces early Thursday, putting 100 warplanes on high alert in Europe whole moving more troops to the Baltics.

Moldova, where some Russian ground troops are already based, is also at risk of falling to Putin. From there, he could strike out at Romania - another former Soviet state.

Unconfirmed reports said that Russian forces had destroyed or rendered unusable the Ukrainian navy, and struck Boryspil Airport in Kiev. Access to the Black Sea and Azov Sea was cut off.

President Joe Biden will address the nation at noon on Thursday, and on Wednesday night he condemned Russia's 'unprovoked and unjustified attack.' He was speaking to Ukraine's president.

Biden said in a statement: 'President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering.

'Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable.'

Biden said he will be monitoring the situation from Washington, DC, and will continue to get regular updates from his national security team.

Putin justified it all in a televised address, asserting that the attack was needed to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine - a false claim the U.S. had predicted he would make as a pretext for an invasion.

He accused the U.S. and its allies of ignoring Russia's demands to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and for security guarantees. He also claimed that Russia does not intend to occupy Ukraine but will move to 'demilitarize' it and bring those who committed crimes to justice.

Biden in a written statement condemned the 'unprovoked and unjustified attack,' and he promised that the U.S. and its allies would 'hold Russia accountable.' The president said he planned to speak to Americans on Thursday after a meeting of the Group of Seven leaders. More sanctions against Russia were expected to be announced Thursday.

Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba described the assault as a 'full-scale invasion' and said Ukraine will 'defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now.'

In the capital, Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko advised residents to stay home unless they are involved in critical work and urged them to prepare go-bags with necessities and documents if they need to evacuate. An Associated Press photographer in Mariupol reported hearing explosions and seeing dozens of people with suitcases heading for their cars to leave the city.

'We are facing a war and horror. What could be worse?' 64-year-old Liudmila Gireyeva said in Kyiv. She planned to head to the western city of Lviv and then to try to move to Poland to join her daughter. Putin 'will be damned by history, and Ukrainians are damning him.'

The Russian claims about knocking out Ukrainian air defenses and Ukrainian claims to have shot down several Russian aircraft could not immediately be verified. The Ukrainian air defense system and air force date back to the Soviet era and are dwarfed by Russia's massive air power and its inventory of precision weapons.

The Russian Defense Ministry said it was not targeting cities, but using precision weapons and claimed that 'there is no threat to civilian population.'

Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister, said on Facebook that the Russian military had launched missile strikes on Ukrainian military command facilities, air bases and military depots in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Dnipro.

Biden announced he will join G7 counterparts on Thursday morning, and will address the country later on Thursday to 'announce the further consequences the United States and its Allies and partners will impose on Russia.'

'We will also coordinate with our NATO Allies to ensure a strong, united response that deters any aggression against the Alliance. Tonight, Jill and I are praying for the brave and proud people of Ukraine,' the statement added.

Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, tweeted early on Thursday: 'I am appalled by the horrific events in Ukraine and I have spoken to President Zelenskyy to discuss next steps. President Putin has chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction by launching this unprovoked attack on Ukraine. The UK and our allies will respond decisively.'

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has also signed restrictions prohibiting all scheduled Russian airlines from entering UK airspace or touching down on British soil.

Putin in his speech on Thursday told other countries not to get involved.

'To anyone who would consider interfering from the outside - if you do, you will face consequences greater than any you have faced in history,' he said in the television broadcast around 6am Moscow time.

The consequences of the conflict and resulting sanctions on Russia could reverberate throughout the world, upending geopolitical dynamics in Europe as well as affecting energy supplies in Europe and jolting global financial markets.

'An explosion made the ground beneath our feet tremble': NICK CRAVEN reports from Kiev Ukrainians woke to the sound of missiles and air strikes as their worst fears were realised, with explosions in Kiev causing the ground to tremble and windows shake. All across the country people ran to basement bomb shelters as Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade. Shortly after 5am the crumps of explosions shook the windows of my hotel room as myself and MailOnline photographer Simon Ashton donned the body armour and helmets that have weighed us down, unused in their bag for the last month. For an hour the night sky lit up in the distance to the north and east of the city as military targets were pounded by bombs, and we run to the basement for safety. Braver - or perhaps more foolish - souls headed in the other direction to the 11th floor roof bar in the Intercontinental Hotel where many international media have based themselves. At 6.36am there was by far the loudest explosion from our perspective, believed to be an air strike on a military airfield near Kyiv, which made the ground beneath our feet tremble. By dawn there was an eerie calm as an overcast drizzly day began, broken only by the cheerful chimes of the bells of St Michael's golden domed Monastery across the square from the hotel at 7am. At 7.05am the first air raid sirens rang out all across the city, though no blitz followed in the central area at least. Surreally, even as the dreaded noise of the sirens rent the air, a steady stream of headlights could be seen driving into the city as commuters came in to start the day. But the calm wasn't to last long as the full extent of the Russian invasion began to reveal itself, with troops attacking the border on three sides and air strikes right across the country, even as far west as Lviv, near the Polish border. By 8am local time, queues of people were seen at bank ATMs in the city, perhaps the first sign of panic, following the introduction of a state of emergency across the country from midnight last night. Police and soldiers stood on many of the street corners to keep order. Long lines also formed at gas stations around the city, but with so many places being pounded from the air, it wasn't obvious where would be the safest place to flee to. Having said that, although the streets were noticeably quieter than usual as the working day began, people were mostly calmly going about their business, perhaps still coming to terms with what might be next. When I first arrived in this country a month ago, few Ukrainians took Putin's sabre-rattling seriously. Most admitted that it was possible he might move into the Donbas to annexe the pro-Russian breakaway republics of Luhansk and Donetsk, but very few believed Russia would mount a full-scale invasion of their neighbour.

Asian stock markets plunged and oil prices surged as the attack began. Earlier, Wall Street's benchmark S&P 500 index fell 1.8% to an eight-month low after the Kremlin said rebels in eastern Ukraine asked for military assistance.

Anticipating international condemnation and countermeasures, Putin issued a stark warning to other countries not to meddle, saying, 'whoever tries to impede us, let alone create threats for our country and its people, must know that the Russian response will be immediate and lead to the consequences you have never seen in history.'

Putin urged Ukrainian servicemen to 'immediately put down arms and go home.'

In a stark reminder of Russia's nuclear power, Putin warned that 'no one should have any doubts that a direct attack on our country will lead to the destruction and horrible consequences for any potential aggressor.' He emphasized that Russia is 'one of the most potent nuclear powers and also has a certain edge in a range of state-of-the-art weapons.'

Though the U.S. on Tuesday announced the repositioning of forces around the Baltics, Biden has said he will not send in troops to fight Russia.

Putin announced the military operation after the Kremlin said rebels in eastern Ukraine asked Russia for military assistance to help fend off Ukrainian 'aggression,' an announcement that the White House said was a 'false flag' operation by Moscow to offer up a pretext for an invasion.

Putin's announcement came just hours after the Ukrainian president rejected Moscow's claims that his country poses a threat to Russia and made a passionate, last-minute plea for peace.

'The people of Ukraine and the government of Ukraine want peace,' Zelenskyy said in an emotional overnight address, speaking in Russian in a direct appeal to Russian citizens. 'But if we come under attack, if we face an attempt to take away our country, our freedom, our lives and lives of our children, we will defend ourselves. When you attack us, you will see our faces, not our backs.'

Zelenskyy said he asked to arrange a call with Putin late Wednesday, but the Kremlin did not respond.

In an apparent reference to Putin's move to authorize the deployment of the Russian military to 'maintain peace' in eastern Ukraine, Zelensky warned that 'this step could mark the start of a big war on the European continent.'

'Any provocation, any spark could trigger a blaze that will destroy everything,' he said.

He challenged the Russian propaganda claims, saying that 'you are told that this blaze will bring freedom to the people of Ukraine, but the Ukrainian people are free.'

At an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council called by Ukraine because of the imminent threat of a Russian invasion, members still unaware of Putin's announcement appealed to him to stop an attack. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres opened the meeting, just before the announcement, telling Putin: 'Stop your troops from attacking Ukraine. Give peace a chance. Too many people have already died.'

NATO Secretary-General Jen Stoltenberg issued a statement condemning 'Russia's reckless and unprovoked attack on Ukraine, which puts at risk countless civilian lives. Once again, despite our repeated warnings and tireless efforts to engage in diplomacy, Russia has chosen the path of aggression against a sovereign and independent country.'

European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen promised to hold the Kremlin accountable.

CNN's correspondent reporting live as Kiev attacked

CNN's correspondent in Kiev was live on air on Thursday morning as Russia's attack was launched. 'I just heard a big bang right here behind me. I've never heard anything like it,' said Matthew Chance, CNN's senior international correspondent. Chance quickly put on his flak jacket and helmet while he continued to report from a balcony in the Ukrainian capital. 'There are big explosions taking place. I can't see them or explain what they are,' he said. 'But I will tell you the U.S has warned the Ukrainian authorities there could be air strikes and ground attacks as well around the country, including the capital. 'I don't know if that's what's occurring now but it's a remarkable coincidence that the explosions come just minutes after Putin gave his speech,' Chance explained. 'This is the first time we've heard anything. It has been absolutely silent. This is the first time. It has to be more than just a coincidence. 'I think it's safe where I am. I have a flak jacket,' Chance remarked before ducking down to put on his protective gear. Advertisement

'In these dark hours, our thoughts are with Ukraine and the innocent women, men and children as they face this unprovoked attack and fear for their lives,' they said on Twitter.

Even before Putin's announcement, dozens of nations imposed sanctions on Russia, further squeezing Russian oligarchs and banks out of international markets.

The Russian Foreign Ministry has shrugged off the sanctions, saying that 'Russia has proven that, with all the costs of the sanctions, it is able to minimize the damage.'

The threat of war has already shredded Ukraine's economy and raised the specter of massive casualties, energy shortages across Europe and global economic chaos.

Across Ukraine, cruise and ballistic missiles were destroying military infrastructure and strategically important facilities, according to unofficial Russian sources.

Mariupol, on the Black Sea 50 miles from the Russian border, appeared to be under fierce attack. Taking this strategic location would give the Donbas republics access to the sea.

The moment Ukraine and the rest of Europe had dreaded for months finally came shortly after 4.35am local time when huge explosions were heard in Kiev and other cities across the country.

Terrified citizens rushed to bomb shelters, though no air raid warnings sounded in the capital – only the frequent muffled crump of missile or air strikes breaking through the pre-dawn stillness.

In Kiev, people were sheltering in basements as the sounds of distant explosions became a constant backdrop.

Within an hour Russians special force and airborne troops were reported to be on the ground at Kiev's Boryspil Airport, amid fierce fighting.

A woman in the Ukrainian capital said: 'I was woken by a friend.

'I am in the centre of Kiev.

'I hear the sound of distant explosions and ambulance sirens.'

At 7.05am the first air raid sirens were heard in central Kiev.

A CNN reporter in Kiev reported hearing blasts live on air in the early hours of Thursday morning.

'I just heard a big bang right here behind me. I've never heard anything like it,' said Matthew Chance, senior international correspondent for the network.

Donald Trump claims that the invasion was sparked by 'election fraud' in 2020 Donald Trump, speaking to Fox's Laura Ingraham on Wednesday night as the Kremlin's 'special military operation' began, claimed that the so-called 'Russia hoax' ruined his good relationships with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi, arguing he kept the two apart. Ingraham asked Trump about the continuing closeness between Putin and Xi. 'Well, I had a good relationship with both,' he said. 'It was hurt by the Russia hoax. You see what happened with Durham and those reports and other reports including Mueller. 'It was just a made up hoax and it really hurt our country but despite the hoax, I had a good relationship and with President Xi of China, other than the fact that I was tariff-ing and taxing the hell out of him. 'As a young man growing up, I always heard that the worst thing that could happen is drive those two countries together. 'It really started with Obama and energy. He drove them together because one needed the energy and the other needed the money,' Trump added. 'He drove them together and Biden - I kept them apart - and Biden now it's a great love fest and that's a very bad thing and I think you can probably add Iran into it too.' Earlier in the interview, in which Trump spoke over the phone with Ingraham, Trump bemoaned that this was happening at all. 'This should have never happened. This would not have happened during my administration. 'In fact, some people are saying why didn't this take place over the last four years?' Advertisement

Chance said that he heard between seven and eight explosions and quickly put on his flak jacket and headgear while he continued to report from a balcony in the Ukrainian capital.

'There are big explosions taking place.

'I can't see them or explain what they are.

'But I will tell you the U.S has warned the Ukrainian authorities there could be air strikes and ground attacks as well around the country, including the capital.

'I don't know if that's what's occurring now but it's a remarkable coincidence that the explosions come just minutes after Putin gave his speech,' Chance explained.

'This is the first time we've heard anything. It has been absolutely silent.

'This is the first time. It has to be more than just a coincidence.

'I think it's safe where I am. I have a flak jacket,' Chance remarked, before ducking down to put on his protective gear.

He suggested that the blasts he heard in the Ukrainian capital were still some distance away from the center.

'It was so quiet in Ukraine tonight up until those explosions,' Chance explained.

The blasts came within minutes of Putin saying Russia would conduct a military operation in eastern Ukraine.

Explosions could also be heard from Ukraine in the Russian city of Belgorod.

Putin told Russians: 'I have decided to conduct a special military operation.

'Russia cannot exist with a constant threat emanating from the territory of Ukraine.

'You and I have been left with no opportunity to protect our people other than the one we use today.'

It comes after explosions were also heard near the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, as fears mounted that shelling is underway.

Residents in the city, which is located in south eastern Ukraine, have been woken up at 3.30am by blasts 30 miles from the Russian border.

Video footage appeared to show clouds of smoke rising up into the night sky near Mariupol, but it was unconfirmed whether it was as a result of shelling.

Putin earlier this week said he wanted to take the major Azov Sea Port of Mariupol, which handles 50 percent Ukraine's steel and mineral exports.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Russia's actions were a 'grave breach of international law' and that allies would meet to address the 'renewed aggression'.

He said on Twitter: 'I strongly condemn #Russia's reckless attack on #Ukraine, which puts at risk countless civilian lives.

'This is a grave breach of international law & a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security. #NATO Allies will meet to address Russia's renewed aggression.'

The British foreign secretary Liz Truss tweeted her condemnation of the attack just after 4am local time.

'I strongly condemn the appalling, unprovoked attack President Putin has launched on the people of Ukraine,' she said.

The explosions come just hours after the U.S. warned the Ukrainian government that Putin's troops are 'ready to go now' with an invasion of Ukraine, with 80 percent of Russian soldiers now assembled around the country in attack positions.

U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken issued a further stark warning and said, hours before the invasion, that he believed Russia would invade before the night is over.

Russia on Wednesday afternoon issued a notice to airmen (NOTAM) which closed the airspace along its northeastern border with Ukraine to all civilian air traffic.

Ukraine later said early on Thursday it had restricted civilian flights in its airspace due to 'potential hazard'.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed that the Ukrainian people will 'fight back' if Putin threatens their freedom and lives by launching a full-scale invasion.

President Zelenskyy made an emotional address to his nation after Moscow-backed rebel leaders in eastern Ukraine asked Putin for military assistance in fending off Ukrainian 'aggression'.

In an emotional televised address on Wednesday night, President Zelenskyy said: 'The people of Ukraine and the government of Ukraine want peace.

'But if we come under attack, if we face an attempt to take away our country, our freedom, our lives and lives of our children, we will defend ourselves.

'When you attack us, you will see our faces, not our backs.'

The Ukrainian president said he had tried to call Putin this evening, but there was 'no answer, only silence', adding that Moscow now has around 200,000 soldiers by Ukraine's borders.

The United Nations Security Council quickly scheduled an emergency meeting Wednesday night - the second in three days - at Ukraine's request.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called the separatists' request 'a further escalation of the security situation.'

Earlier on Wednesday, Ukraine was placed on a war footing: A state of emergency was declared and approved by parliament, 200,000 military reservists called up, border zones were restricted and three million Ukrainians told to leave Russia, with Kiev acknowledging for the first time that an attack could now take place anywhere, at any time.

Biden on Wednesday warned President Zelenskyy of an 'imminent' attack by Putin's troops in the next 48 hours - , just hours after Ukraine was hit by a 'massive' cyberattack targeting its government and banks.

But Blinken cut that time frame of a Russian invasion drastically and said on Wednesday night he expected Russia to invade Ukraine before the night was over.

U.S. intelligence chiefs knew Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, was at particular risk of being targeted in a Russian invasion as it is close to the Ukrainian-Russian border.

On Thursday, Ukraine said Vladimir Putin had launched a “full-scale invasion”, following the Russian president announcing a “special military operation” in the east of the country. After his televised address, explosions were reported in the outskirts of the cities of Kharkiv, Kramatorsk, Mariupol, as well as the capital Kiev.

Footage and pictures show smoke rising in areas across Ukraine.

Twitter account @gt_lozt posed a video showing smoke rising following an explosion at Ochakiv Port in Mykolaiv Oblast.

A video posted by BNO News showed an apartment complex near Ukraine's Kharkiv hit by an airstrike, causing an unknown number of casualties.

Explosions were also seen and heard in Kiev and Kharkiv regions because of missile strikes by Russia.

Russian-backed separatists say they now control two towns in the Luhansk region of Ukraine, according to a report from RIA news agency. This report was confirmed by Ukraine police who later said two villages in Luhansk region seized. Russia’s defence ministry said it has taken out military infrastructure at Ukrainian airbases and degraded Ukraine’s air defences, Russian news agencies reported. The Russian ministry denied reports that one of its aircraft had been downed over Ukraine.

In the chilling footage, a missile is seen flying across the cloudy sky before hitting the airport, resulting in a massive explosion.

It's unknown whether there were any casualties.

Russia has launched a wide-ranging attack on the country, hitting cities and bases with air strikes or shelling, as civilians piled into trains and cars to flee.

Ukraine’s government said Russian tanks and troops rolled across the border in what it called a “full-scale war” that could rewrite the geopolitical order and whose fallout has already reverberated around the globe.

In announcing a major military operation, Russian President Vladimir Putin deflected global condemnation and cascading new sanctions – and chillingly referred to his country’s nuclear arsenal as he threatened any foreign country attempting to interfere with “consequences you have never seen”.

NATO's chief said the “brutal act of war” shattered peace on the European continent, as the US-led alliance mobilised more troops to move towards eastern Europe.

Sirens rang out in Ukraine’s capital Kyiv and people massed in train stations and took to roads, as the government said the former Soviet republic was seeing a long-anticipated invasion from the east, north and south and reported more than 40 soldiers had been killed and dozens wounded.

“A full-scale war in Europe has begun,” Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said.

“Russia is not only attacking Ukraine, but the rules of normal life in the modern world.”

Boris Johnson addressed the nation today, stressing on the importance of freedom as Putin unleashes ""war"" against Ukraine.

The Prime Minister vowed that Britain “cannot and will not just look away” from Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and pledged to unite with allies to respond with a massive package of sanctions designed to “hobble the Russian economy”.

In a televised statement at midday on Thursday, he said the world cannot stand by and allow the freedom of Ukraine to be “snuffed out”, as Moscow hit its neighbour with a wide-ranging attack, targeting cities and bases with air strikes or shelling.

“This act of wanton and reckless aggression is an attack not just on Ukraine, it’s an attack on democracy and freedom in eastern Europe and around the world,” Mr Johnson said from Downing Street.

The Prime Minister criticised the Russian president for having “unleashed war in our European continent”, attacking Ukraine “without any provocation and without any credible excuse”.

Mr Johnson, who earlier chaired an emergency meeting of the Cobra committee, said: “Innumerable missiles and bombs have been raining down on an entirely innocent population.

“A vast invasion is under way by land, by sea and by air.

“We, and the world, cannot allow that freedom just to be snuffed out. We cannot and will not just look away.

“Today in concert with our allies we will agree a massive package of economic sanctions designed in time to hobble the Russian economy.

“Diplomatically, politically, economically, and eventually, militarily, this hideous and barbaric venture of Vladimir Putin must end in failure.”

Mr Johnson warned of the prospect of “grim” months to come before echoing an earlier address from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in speaking directly to the Russian public.

“I cannot believe this is being done in your name or that you really want the pariah status it will bring to the Putin regime,” the Prime Minister said.",https://www.gbnews.uk/news/russian-missiles-strike-airport-in-ukraine-as-putin-ramps-up-war-move-watch-video/234150

Mr Johnson said: ""Shortly after 4 o’ clock this morning I spoke to president Zelenskyy of Ukraine to offer the continued support of the UK because our worst fears have now come true and all our warnings have proved tragically accurate.

""President Putin of Russia has unleashed war in our European continent. He has attacked a friendly country without any provocation and without any credible excuse.

""Innumerable missiles and bombs have been raining down on an entirely innocent population. A vast invasion is underway by land by sea and by air.

""And this is not in the infamous phrase some faraway country of which we know little We have Ukrainian friends in this country; neighbours, co-workers.

""Ukraine is a country that for decades has enjoyed freedom and democracy and the right to choose its own destiny We – and the world – cannot allow that freedom just to be snuffed out. We cannot and will not just look away.

""It is because we have been so alarmed in recent months at the Russian intimidation that the UK became one of the first countries in Europe to send defensive weaponry to help the Ukrainians.

""Other allies have now done the same and we will do what more we can in the days ahead Today in concert with our allies we will agree a massive package of economic sanctions designed in time to hobble the Russian economy.

""And to that end we must also collectively cease the dependence on Russian oil and gas that for too long has given Putin his grip on western politics.



""Our mission is clear. Diplomatically, politically, economically – and eventually, militarily – this hideous and barbaric venture of Vladimir Putin must end in failure.



""And so I say to the people of Russia, whose president has just authorised a tidal wave of violence against a fellow Slavic people.



""The parents of Russian soldiers who will lose their lives. I cannot believe this is being done in your name or that you really want the pariah status it will bring to the Putin regime.



""And I say to the Ukrainians in this moment of agony.



""We are with you we are praying for you and your families and we are on your side And if the months ahead are grim, and the flame of freedom burns low.



""I know that it will blaze bright again in Ukraine because for all his bombs and tanks and missiles I don’t believe that the Russian dictator will ever subdue the national feeling of the Ukrainians and their passionate belief that their country should be free, and I say to the British people and all who have heard the threats from Putin against those who stand with Ukraine.



""We will of course do everything to keep our country safe. We are joined in our outrage by friends and allies around the world.



""We will work with them – for however long it takes – to ensure that the sovereignty and independence of Ukraine is restored because this act of wanton and reckless aggression is an attack not just on Ukraine.



""It is an attack on democracy and freedom in East Europe and around the world This crisis is about the right of a free, sovereign independent European people to choose their own future and that is a right that the UK will always defend.""



Earlier, Mr Johnson said Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is a “catastrophe for our continent”, as he called on world leaders to meet and plan a response.

Putin issued a warning last night ahead of what has been dubbed a ""full-scale invasion"" by Ukraine's foreign minister.

In his address, Putin warned anyone “who might be tempted to meddle in the ongoing events: whoever tries to stand in our way or create threats for our country … people should know Russia’s response will be immediate and lead you to consequences you have never encountered in your history"".

The Prime Minister tweeted his remarks after chairing an urgent Cobra emergency committee meeting this morning, which took place in response to Russia's move.

He is due to speak in the Commons in the evening.

The Prime Minister said: “This is a catastrophe for our continent.

“I will make an address to the nation this morning on the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

“I will also speak to fellow G7 leaders and I am calling for an urgent meeting of all Nato leaders as soon as possible.”

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss summoned Russian ambassador to the UK Andrei Kelin, for the second time this week, to explain the “illegal, unprovoked invasion of Ukraine”.

Ms Truss said: “We will be imposing severe sanctions and rallying countries in support of Ukraine.”

It came as Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared martial law and urged people to stay indoors, amid reports of missile strikes and explosions across the country.

Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, accused Mr Putin of “bringing war back to Europe”.

Zelenskyy called on Ukrainian nationals to volunteer for the resistance effort.

He said: “We will give weapons to anyone who wants to defend the country. Be ready to support Ukraine in the squares of our cities.

“We will lift sanctions on all citizens of Ukraine who are ready to defend our country as part of territorial defence with weapons in hands.

Ukraine’s capital was under bombardment in the early hours of Friday, with the skies ablaze as Vladimir Putin’s tanks moved to within 20 miles of Kyiv.

Ukraine’s deputy defense ministry said that one missile was shot out of the sky by their anti-missile defense systems.

Another missile struck a residential building in the city, the government said.

A Ukrainian jet, a SU-27, was shot down by a surface-to-air missile in a separate incident, the Ukrainian government said.

The country has 125 combat-capable aircraft, including 4th-generation fighter workhorses Sukhoi Su‑27 and Mikoyan MiG‑29, according to Military Balance 2021. Russia has more than 1,500 fighter jets.

Ukrainian Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashenko shared footage on social media of a blaze in what he said was the Darnitsky district of Kyiv, in the southeast of the city on the left bank of the Dnipro river.

It was unclear whether the Darnitsky fire was caused by the downed Ukrainian jet, or the Russian missiles.

Hours earlier, President Volodymyr Zelensky raged at Western cowards who failed to come to his aid, saying his country is being ‘left alone’ to face Russian troops.

Officials warn that Kyiv will be seized this weekend.

In a video address to his nation after midnight, the president called his fallen compatriots ‘heroes’ after 137 were killed on the first day of fighting, and insisted he will stay until the bitter end.

He said: ‘They’re killing people and turning peaceful cities into military targets. It’s foul and will never be forgiven.

‘We have been left alone to defend our state. Who is ready to fight alongside us? I don’t see anyone.

‘Who is ready to give Ukraine a guarantee of NATO membership? Everyone is afraid.’

He added that the enemy has already entered Kyiv and urged residents to be vigilant and observe curfew rules, acknowledging he was ‘target number one’.

The Ukrainian capital is expected to be surrounded by Russian forces this weekend and the country’s resistance effectively crippled, US security officials fear.

Troops are already closing in on the seat of Ukrainian power after taking control of the strategic Chernobyl nuclear power plant today, and will seize it within 96 hours, bringing a ‘new Iron Curtain’ down on Europe, Zelensky warned.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Vladimir Putin plans to encircle Ukrainian forces in Kyiv and force them to either surrender or be destroyed, and the leadership of Ukraine could then fall in a week.

A former senior US intelligence officer told Newsweek: ‘After the air and artillery end and the ground war really starts, I think Kyiv falls in just a few days.

‘The military may last slightly longer but this isn’t going to last long.’

A source close to the Ukrainian government said they agreed that Kyiv will be surrounded within 96 hours but believed the government will stay strong and not collapse.

In a bid to thwart the imminent capture of the city, Emmanuel Macron spoke to Vladimir Putin on Thursday night, who gave the French leader an ‘exhaustive’ explanation of his justification for war.

The Kremlin said the call took place at Macron’s initiative, and he and Putin agreed to stay in contact.

Zelensky has also signed a decree on the general mobilisation of the population within 90 days, but men aged 18-60 are banned from leaving the country.

It comes after Russian forces seized control of Chernobyl nuclear power plant after a ‘fierce’ battle, with the condition of nuclear storage facilities ‘unknown’, sparking fears of a radiation leak that could cause fallout in Europe.

Video revealed Russian tanks and armoured vehicles standing in front of the destroyed reactor, which sits just 60 miles north of the capital Kyiv.

An official said Russian shelling hit a radioactive waste repository and an increase in radiation levels was reported, although this has not yet been corroborated.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said it is following the situation in Ukraine ‘with grave concern’ and appealed for maximum restraint to avoid any action that may put Ukraine’s nuclear facilities at risk.

Ukrainian presidential advisor Myhailo Podolyak said: ‘After the absolutely senseless attack of the Russians in this direction, it is impossible to say that the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is safe.’

Meanwhile Turkey reported that one of its ships had been hit by a ‘bomb’ off the coast of Odessa, where fighting is also going on. Turkey is a member of NATO, underlining fears that the war in Ukraine could quickly suck in other states and spark an all-out conflict in Europe.

Speaking after the latest developments, Joe Biden announced more sanctions against Russia but admitted that he had not expected previous threats of financial penalties to deter Vladimir Putin.

He also resisted calls to send in US troops to Ukraine, saying he has no plans to speak to the Russian leader who he accuses of trying to rebuild a Soviet empire.

The sanctions will target Russian banks, oligarchs, state-controlled companies and high-tech sectors, but Russian oil and natural gas were exempt in a bid to avoid disruption to global markets.

‘Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences,’ Biden said in remarks at the White House.

Elsewhere, Kyiv ordered civilians into bomb shelters and declared a curfew amid concerns Russia is about to strike the capital as Ukrainian troops lost control of a key airfield around 15 miles away. Russian forces had attacked it with around two dozen attack helicopters earlier in the day, four of which are thought to have been shot down.

‘They are going to bomb Kyiv now. Authorities told us to hide in shelters,’ a source in the city told MailOnline as authorities said a hospital had been hit, killing four people.

The Ukrainian army was this afternoon fighting in almost every region of the country, battling the Russians for control of military bases, airports, cities and ports from Kharkiv to Kyiv, and Donetsk to Odessa.

It came after Vladimir Putin personally gave the order to attack around 5am on Thursday, unleashing a salvo of rocket fire that American intelligence said involved more than 100 short and medium-range ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and surface-to-air missiles, and 75 bombers that targeted military sites including barracks, warehouses and airfields in order to knock out the country’s military command structure.

Russia said the strikes destroyed 74 Ukrainian military ground facilities, 11 airfields, three command posts and 18 radar stations controlling Kyiv’s anti-aircraft batteries.

That was followed by attacks from Crimea in the south towards the city of Kherson, a northern advance from Belarus to Kyiv, and an eastern advance from Belgorod towards Kharkiv where the heaviest fighting is going on.

American officials said this was merely an ‘initial phase’ of the attack, and that the majority of Russia’s 190,000 troops at the front remain in reserve. The goal of the attack is to ‘take key population centres’ and ‘decapitate the Ukrainian government’, the officials added.

Ukraine’s health ministry said so far 137 people have been killed on the first day of conflict, while 300 have been wounded.

The port cities of Mariupol and Odessa, where Ukraine’s main naval bases are located, were also attacked – though Odessa appeared to remain under Ukrainian control as of Thursday afternoon. Russian tankers blockaded the Kerch Strait, leading from the Back Sea to the Sea of Azov, cutting off Mariupol.

Ukraine has hit back, shooting down five Russian helicopters, destroying dozens of tanks and capturing Russian troops.

A Russian AN-26 military transport aircraft also crashed in the southern Voronezh region, killing its crew on board.

The accident could have been caused by a technical failure and has not inflicted any damage on the ground, Interfax said, citing a press office of Russia’s western military district.

In the address to his nation, Zelensky also described Russia as ‘evil’ and said Putin had attacked ‘like a suicidal scoundrel… just as Fascist Germany did in World War II’.

‘Ukraine will not surrender its freedom, whatever Moscow thinks,’ he added. ‘For Ukrainians independence and the right to live free on our land is the highest value.’

He had earlier called on all Ukrainian citizens willing to defend their homeland to step forward, saying guns will be issued to everyone who wants one. He also asked for civilians to give blood to help wounded troops. And he asked world leaders to impose the ‘harshest sanctions possible’ on Putin.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, addressing the nation at midday, said western allies are preparing a ‘massive’ package of sanctions against Russia and told the people of Ukraine: ‘We cannot and will not just look away.’ Johnson referred to Putin as a ‘dictator’ who would never ‘subdue the national feeling of the Ukrainians’.

As the West prepared to cut off Russia financially, Vladimir Putin summoned his oligarchs to demand loyalty over his attack on Ukraine – perhaps fearing a rebellion from within after prominent Russian TV figures and celebrities spoke out to oppose the conflict.

Speaking in the Kremlin, he said that Russia had been ‘forced’ to take action over Ukraine and had ‘no other choice’ but to attack, saying the country remains ‘part of the global economy’ and that he ‘will not hurt the system we belong to’. ‘I want you to show solidarity with the government,’ he told them.

World leaders react to Russia’s war on Ukraine RUSSIA PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN ‘I have decided to conduct a special military operation… to protect people who have been subjected to bullying and genocide… for the last eight years. ‘And for this we will strive for the demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine. And to bring to court those who committed numerous bloody crimes against civilians, including against citizens of the Russian Federation.’ UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY ‘Russia treacherously attacked our state in the morning, as Nazi Germany did in the WW2 years. ‘As of today, our countries are on different sides of world history. Russia has embarked on a path of evil, but Ukraine is defending itself & won’t give up its freedom no matter what Moscow thinks.’ NATO SECRETARY-GENERAL JENS STOLTENBERG ‘This is a deliberate, cold-blooded and long-planned invasion… ‘Peace on our continent has been shattered Russia is using force to try to rewrite history, and deny Ukraine its free and independent path… ‘We have no plans to send NATO troops in Ukraine. What we do is defensive.’ U.S PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN ‘President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering… ‘I will be meeting with the leaders of the G7, and the United States and our allies and partners will be imposing severe sanctions on Russia.’ EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT URSULA VON DER LEYEN ‘President Putin is responsible for bringing war back to Europe… ‘We will target strategic sectors of the Russian economy by blocking their access to key technologies and markets. We will weaken Russia’s economic base and its capacity to modernise.’ ‘In addition, we will freeze Russian assets in the EU and stop the access of Russian banks to the European financial market.’ EUROPEAN COMMISSION FOREIGN POLICY CHIEF JOSEP BORRELL ‘These are among the darkest hours of Europe since the Second World War. ‘The EU will respond in the strongest possible terms and agree on the harshest package of sanctions we have ever implemented.’ GERMAN CHANCELLOR OLAF SCHOLZ ‘Putin is bringing suffering and destruction to his direct neighbours, he is violating the sovereignty and borders of Ukraine. ‘He is endangering the lives of countless innocent people (and)… the peace order on our continent. For all that there is no justification. This is Putin’s war.’ FRENCH PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON ‘France strongly condemns the decision of Russia to start a war with Ukraine. Russia must immediately put an end to its military operations.’ BRITISH PRIME MINISTER BORIS JOHNSON ‘President Putin has chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction by launching this unprovoked attack on Ukraine… ‘This is a catastrophe for our continent.’ CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON HUA CHUNYING ‘You are using a typical Western media question method of using the word invasion. ‘China is closely monitoring the latest situation. We call on all sides to exercise restraint to prevent the situation from getting out of control.’ GERMAN ARMY CHIEF LIEUTENANT GENERAL ALFONS MAIS ‘In my 41th year of peace-time service, I would not have thought that I would have to experience a war. ‘And the Bundeswehr, the army which I have the honour to command, is standing there more or less empty-handed. The options we can offer the government in support of the (NATO)alliance are extremely limited… ‘We have all seen it coming but were not able to get through with our arguments to draw the consequences after (Russia’s) annexation of Crimea. This does not feel good. I am fed up with it.’ TURKISH FOREIGN MINISTRY ‘This attack is a grave violation of international law and poses a serious threat to the security of our region and the world. ‘We call on the Russian Federation to immediately end this unjust and unlawful act.’ HUNGARIAN PRIME MINISTER VIKTOR ORBAN ‘With our EU and NATO allies, we condemn Russia’s military attack.’ PORTUGUESE PRIME MINISTER ANTONIO COSTA ‘The answer to this crisis should be a diplomatic solution… NATO will not intervene or act in Ukraine. ‘Ukrainian citizens who have family, friends and acquaintances here are welcome in Portugal.’ ISRAELI FOREIGN MINISTER YAIR LAPID ‘Russia’s attack on Ukraine is a grave breach of international order. Israel condemns the attack.’ RUSSIAN EX-OIL TYCOON AND ARCH KREMLIN CRITIC MIKHAIL KHODORKOVSKY ‘It is Putin and his entourage who started the war in order to hold on to their power – not the Russian people. ‘Unleashing a war of aggression and using the armed forces for personal gain signifies that a junta led by Putin has seized power in Russia.’ EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK POLICYMAKER YANNIS STOURNARAS ‘In my view it is going to have a short-term inflationary effect â that is prices will increase due to higher energy costs. ‘But in the medium to long term I think that the consequences will be deflationary through adverse trade effects.’

It came after Putin gave an extraordinary address to the Russian nation – broadcast in the early hours during a UN meeting aimed at avoiding war – in which he declared a ‘special military operation’ to ‘de-militarise’ and ‘de-Nazify’ Ukraine in what amounted to a outright declaration of war.

The video appeared to have been pre-recorded, around the same time as Putin’s Monday address recognising Donbass as independent.

Putin also issued a chilling warning to any country thinking of coming to Ukraine’s aid, vowing ‘consequences greater than any you have faced in history’.

He added: ‘I hope I have been heard.’

The mood on the ground in Ukraine was mixed. Some showed incredible resolve – heading to work via train and road even as the bombs dropped. Elderly women in the city of Kharkiv, under heavy attack, gathered in the street to pray.

But for others, the sight of Russian attack was too much. Highways out of Kyiv clogged with cars as people fled, while refugees began crossing the borders into Poland and Slovakia.

One Ukrainian woman voiced the outrage of her nation on Thursday as she confronted heavily-armed Russian soldiers and demanded to know what they were doing in her country.

The woman, wearing a headscarf, shouted at two of the invaders: ‘What the f*** are you doing in our land?’ while one of the embarrassed soldiers in Henichesk, a port city on the sea of Azov, tried to calm her.

She walked away, then called back: ‘You should put sunflower seeds in your pockets so that they will grow on Ukrainian land after you die.’

Speaking in an emergency White House press conference, Biden called Putin a ‘pariah’ on the international stage and called on the West to stand up to the ‘bully’.

But he insisted the US would not be helping Ukraine with troops.

He said: ‘Our forces are not, and will not be, engaged in the conflict with Russia in Ukraine. Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our Nato allies and reassure those allies in the east.

‘When the history of this era is written, Putin’s choice to make a totally unjustifiable war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.

‘He has much larger ambitions than Ukraine. He wants to, in fact, re-establish the former Soviet Union. That’s what this is about.’

Meanwhile protesters in Moscow voiced their support for Ukraine as they chanted ‘There is no war’ outside Pushkinskaya Metro station in the Russian capital.

The invasion – a naked attempt to redraw the map of Europe by force – marks the most concerted attempt to up-end world order since the end of the Cold War, and risks sparking the bloodiest conflict in Europe since the end of the Second World War.

Underlining the gravity of the moment, Ukrainian Interior Ministry advisor Anton Herashchenko said: ‘Starting today, the world has a new geopolitical reality. Either Ukraine and the world will stop the new Hitler now, or there will be a Third World War.’

Western leaders lined up to condemn Russia’s actions in the early hours, with security councils convened the world over to mount a response. Heavy sanctions are expected to follow, along with more shipments of military equipment to Ukraine – provided they can find a route in.

But NATO and the US have made it clear that no troops will be sent, leaving Ukraine’s military – far the inferior of Russia – to hold off the assault alone. Few expect it to emerge victorious from what is almost certain to be a prolonged, bloody, and vicious war.

NATO is expected to focus its efforts on stopping the war from spilling over into neighbouring countries. Poland, a member of the alliance, shares an extensive land border with Ukraine. The Baltic states – Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, also NATO members – will now fear a Russian assault.

The alliance began moving its forces early Thursday, putting 100 warplanes on high alert in Europe whole moving more troops to the Baltics.

Moldova, where some Russian ground troops are already based, is also at risk of falling to Putin. From there, he could strike out at Romania – another former Soviet state.

Unconfirmed reports said that Russian forces had destroyed or rendered unusable the Ukrainian navy, and struck Boryspil Airport in Kyiv. Access to the Black Sea and Azov Sea was cut off.

Biden said in a statement: ‘President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering.

‘Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable.’

Biden said he will be monitoring the situation from Washington, DC, and will continue to get regular updates from his national security team.

Putin justified it all in a televised address, asserting that the attack was needed to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine – a false claim the U.S. had predicted he would make as a pretext for an invasion.

He accused the U.S. and its allies of ignoring Russia’s demands to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and for security guarantees. He also claimed that Russia does not intend to occupy Ukraine but will move to ‘demilitarize’ it and bring those who committed crimes to justice.

Biden in a written statement condemned the ‘unprovoked and unjustified attack,’ and he promised that the U.S. and its allies would ‘hold Russia accountable.’

Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba described the assault as a ‘full-scale invasion’ and said Ukraine will ‘defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now.’

In the capital, Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko advised residents to stay home unless they are involved in critical work and urged them to prepare go-bags with necessities and documents if they need to evacuate. An Associated Press photographer in Mariupol reported hearing explosions and seeing dozens of people with suitcases heading for their cars to leave the city.

‘We are facing a war and horror. What could be worse?’ 64-year-old Liudmila Gireyeva said in Kyiv. She planned to head to the western city of Lviv and then to try to move to Poland to join her daughter. Putin ‘will be damned by history, and Ukrainians are damning him.’

The Russian claims about knocking out Ukrainian air defenses and Ukrainian claims to have shot down several Russian aircraft could not immediately be verified. The Ukrainian air defense system and air force date back to the Soviet era and are dwarfed by Russia’s massive air power and its inventory of precision weapons.

The Russian Defense Ministry said it was not targeting cities, but using precision weapons and claimed that ‘there is no threat to civilian population.’

Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, said on Facebook that the Russian military had launched missile strikes on Ukrainian military command facilities, air bases and military depots in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Dnipro.

Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, tweeted early on Thursday: ‘I am appalled by the horrific events in Ukraine and I have spoken to President Zelensky to discuss next steps. President Putin has chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction by launching this unprovoked attack on Ukraine. The UK and our allies will respond decisively.’

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has also signed restrictions prohibiting all scheduled Russian airlines from entering UK airspace or touching down on British soil.

Putin in his speech on Thursday told other countries not to get involved.

‘To anyone who would consider interfering from the outside – if you do, you will face consequences greater than any you have faced in history,’ he said in the television broadcast around 6am Moscow time.

The consequences of the conflict and resulting sanctions on Russia could reverberate throughout the world, upending geopolitical dynamics in Europe as well as affecting energy supplies in Europe and jolting global financial markets.

‘An explosion made the ground beneath our feet tremble’: NICK CRAVEN reports from Kyiv Ukrainians woke to the sound of missiles and air strikes as their worst fears were realised, with explosions in Kyiv causing the ground to tremble and windows shake. All across the country people ran to basement bomb shelters as Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade. Shortly after 5am the crumps of explosions shook the windows of my hotel room as myself and MailOnline photographer Simon Ashton donned the body armour and helmets that have weighed us down, unused in their bag for the last month. For an hour the night sky lit up in the distance to the north and east of the city as military targets were pounded by bombs, and we run to the basement for safety. Braver – or perhaps more foolish – souls headed in the other direction to the 11th floor roof bar in the Intercontinental Hotel where many international media have based themselves. At 6.36am there was by far the loudest explosion from our perspective, believed to be an air strike on a military airfield near Kyiv, which made the ground beneath our feet tremble. By dawn there was an eerie calm as an overcast drizzly day began, broken only by the cheerful chimes of the bells of St Michael’s golden domed Monastery across the square from the hotel at 7am. At 7.05am the first air raid sirens rang out all across the city, though no blitz followed in the central area at least. Surreally, even as the dreaded noise of the sirens rent the air, a steady stream of headlights could be seen driving into the city as commuters came in to start the day. But the calm wasn’t to last long as the full extent of the Russian invasion began to reveal itself, with troops attacking the border on three sides and air strikes right across the country, even as far west as Lviv, near the Polish border. By 8am local time, queues of people were seen at bank ATMs in the city, perhaps the first sign of panic, following the introduction of a state of emergency across the country from midnight last night. Police and soldiers stood on many of the street corners to keep order. Long lines also formed at gas stations around the city, but with so many places being pounded from the air, it wasn’t obvious where would be the safest place to flee to. Having said that, although the streets were noticeably quieter than usual as the working day began, people were mostly calmly going about their business, perhaps still coming to terms with what might be next. When I first arrived in this country a month ago, few Ukrainians took Putin’s sabre-rattling seriously. Most admitted that it was possible he might move into the Donbas to annexe the pro-Russian breakaway republics of Luhansk and Donetsk, but very few believed Russia would mount a full-scale invasion of their neighbour.

Asian stock markets plunged and oil prices surged as the attack began. Earlier, Wall Street’s benchmark S&P 500 index fell 1.8% to an eight-month low after the Kremlin said rebels in eastern Ukraine asked for military assistance.

Anticipating international condemnation and countermeasures, Putin issued a stark warning to other countries not to meddle, saying, ‘whoever tries to impede us, let alone create threats for our country and its people, must know that the Russian response will be immediate and lead to the consequences you have never seen in history.’

Putin urged Ukrainian servicemen to ‘immediately put down arms and go home.’

In a stark reminder of Russia’s nuclear power, Putin warned that ‘no one should have any doubts that a direct attack on our country will lead to the destruction and horrible consequences for any potential aggressor.’

He emphasized that Russia is ‘one of the most potent nuclear powers and also has a certain edge in a range of state-of-the-art weapons.’

Though the U.S. on Tuesday announced the repositioning of forces around the Baltics, Biden has said he will not send in troops to fight Russia.

Putin announced the military operation after the Kremlin said rebels in eastern Ukraine asked Russia for military assistance to help fend off Ukrainian ‘aggression,’ an announcement that the White House said was a ‘false flag’ operation by Moscow to offer up a pretext for an invasion.

Putin’s announcement came just hours after the Ukrainian president rejected Moscow’s claims that his country poses a threat to Russia and made a passionate, last-minute plea for peace.

‘The people of Ukraine and the government of Ukraine want peace,’ Zelensky said in an emotional overnight address, speaking in Russian in a direct appeal to Russian citizens.

‘But if we come under attack, if we face an attempt to take away our country, our freedom, our lives and lives of our children, we will defend ourselves. When you attack us, you will see our faces, not our backs.’

Zelensky said he asked to arrange a call with Putin late Wednesday, but the Kremlin did not respond.

In an apparent reference to Putin’s move to authorize the deployment of the Russian military to ‘maintain peace’ in eastern Ukraine, Zelensky warned that ‘this step could mark the start of a big war on the European continent.’

‘Any provocation, any spark could trigger a blaze that will destroy everything,’ he said.

He challenged the Russian propaganda claims, saying that ‘you are told that this blaze will bring freedom to the people of Ukraine, but the Ukrainian people are free.’

At an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council called by Ukraine because of the imminent threat of a Russian invasion, members still unaware of Putin’s announcement appealed to him to stop an attack.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres opened the meeting, just before the announcement, telling Putin: ‘Stop your troops from attacking Ukraine. Give peace a chance. Too many people have already died.’

NATO Secretary-General Jen Stoltenberg issued a statement condemning ‘Russia’s reckless and unprovoked attack on Ukraine, which puts at risk countless civilian lives.

‘Once again, despite our repeated warnings and tireless efforts to engage in diplomacy, Russia has chosen the path of aggression against a sovereign and independent country.’

European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen promised to hold the Kremlin accountable.

CNN’s correspondent reporting live as Kyiv attacked CNN’s correspondent in Kyiv was live on air on Thursday morning as Russia’s attack was launched. ‘I just heard a big bang right here behind me. I’ve never heard anything like it,’ said Matthew Chance, CNN’s senior international correspondent. Chance quickly put on his flak jacket and helmet while he continued to report from a balcony in the Ukrainian capital. ‘There are big explosions taking place. I can’t see them or explain what they are,’ he said. ‘But I will tell you the U.S has warned the Ukrainian authorities there could be air strikes and ground attacks as well around the country, including the capital. ‘I don’t know if that’s what’s occurring now but it’s a remarkable coincidence that the explosions come just minutes after Putin gave his speech,’ Chance explained. ‘This is the first time we’ve heard anything. It has been absolutely silent. This is the first time. It has to be more than just a coincidence. ‘I think it’s safe where I am. I have a flak jacket,’ Chance remarked before ducking down to put on his protective gear.

‘In these dark hours, our thoughts are with Ukraine and the innocent women, men and children as they face this unprovoked attack and fear for their lives,’ they said on Twitter.

Even before Putin’s announcement, dozens of nations imposed sanctions on Russia, further squeezing Russian oligarchs and banks out of international markets.

The Russian Foreign Ministry has shrugged off the sanctions, saying that ‘Russia has proven that, with all the costs of the sanctions, it is able to minimize the damage.’

The threat of war has already shredded Ukraine’s economy and raised the specter of massive casualties, energy shortages across Europe and global economic chaos.

Across Ukraine, cruise and ballistic missiles were destroying military infrastructure and strategically important facilities, according to unofficial Russian sources.

Mariupol, on the Black Sea 50 miles from the Russian border, appeared to be under fierce attack. Taking this strategic location would give the Donbas republics access to the sea.

The moment Ukraine and the rest of Europe had dreaded for months finally came shortly after 4.35am local time on Thursday when huge explosions were heard in Kyiv and other cities across the country.

Terrified citizens rushed to bomb shelters, though no air raid warnings sounded in the capital – only the frequent muffled crump of missile or air strikes breaking through the pre-dawn stillness.

In Kyiv, people were sheltering in basements as the sounds of distant explosions became a constant backdrop.

Within an hour Russians special force and airborne troops were reported to be on the ground at Kyiv’s Boryspil Airport, amid fierce fighting.

A woman in the Ukrainian capital said: ‘I was woken by a friend.

‘I am in the centre of Kyiv.

‘I hear the sound of distant explosions and ambulance sirens.’

At 7.05am the first air raid sirens were heard in central Kyiv.

A CNN reporter in Kyiv reported hearing blasts live on air in the early hours of Thursday morning.

‘I just heard a big bang right here behind me. I’ve never heard anything like it,’ said Matthew Chance, senior international correspondent for the network.

Donald Trump claims that the invasion was sparked by ‘election fraud’ in 2020 Donald Trump, speaking to Fox’s Laura Ingraham on Wednesday night as the Kremlin’s ‘special military operation’ began, claimed that the so-called ‘Russia hoax’ ruined his good relationships with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi, arguing he kept the two apart. Ingraham asked Trump about the continuing closeness between Putin and Xi. ‘Well, I had a good relationship with both,’ he said. ‘It was hurt by the Russia hoax. You see what happened with Durham and those reports and other reports including Mueller. ‘It was just a made up hoax and it really hurt our country but despite the hoax, I had a good relationship and with President Xi of China, other than the fact that I was tariff-ing and taxing the hell out of him. ‘As a young man growing up, I always heard that the worst thing that could happen is drive those two countries together. ‘It really started with Obama and energy. He drove them together because one needed the energy and the other needed the money,’ Trump added. ‘He drove them together and Biden – I kept them apart – and Biden now it’s a great love fest and that’s a very bad thing and I think you can probably add Iran into it too.’ Earlier in the interview, in which Trump spoke over the phone with Ingraham, Trump bemoaned that this was happening at all. ‘This should have never happened. This would not have happened during my administration. ‘In fact, some people are saying why didn’t this take place over the last four years?’

Chance said that he heard between seven and eight explosions and quickly put on his flak jacket and headgear while he continued to report from a balcony in the Ukrainian capital.

‘There are big explosions taking place.

‘I can’t see them or explain what they are.

‘But I will tell you the U.S has warned the Ukrainian authorities there could be air strikes and ground attacks as well around the country, including the capital.

‘I don’t know if that’s what’s occurring now but it’s a remarkable coincidence that the explosions come just minutes after Putin gave his speech,’ Chance explained.

‘This is the first time we’ve heard anything. It has been absolutely silent.

‘This is the first time. It has to be more than just a coincidence.

‘I think it’s safe where I am. I have a flak jacket,’ Chance remarked, before ducking down to put on his protective gear.

He suggested that the blasts he heard in the Ukrainian capital were still some distance away from the center.

‘It was so quiet in Ukraine tonight up until those explosions,’ Chance explained.

The blasts came within minutes of Putin saying Russia would conduct a military operation in eastern Ukraine.

Explosions could also be heard from Ukraine in the Russian city of Belgorod.

Putin told Russians: ‘I have decided to conduct a special military operation.

‘Russia cannot exist with a constant threat emanating from the territory of Ukraine.

‘You and I have been left with no opportunity to protect our people other than the one we use today.’

It comes after explosions were also heard near the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, as fears mounted that shelling is underway.

Residents in the city, which is located in south eastern Ukraine, have been woken up at 3.30am by blasts 30 miles from the Russian border.

Video footage appeared to show clouds of smoke rising up into the night sky near Mariupol, but it was unconfirmed whether it was as a result of shelling.

Putin earlier this week said he wanted to take the major Azov Sea Port of Mariupol, which handles 50 percent Ukraine’s steel and mineral exports.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Russia’s actions were a ‘grave breach of international law’ and that allies would meet to address the ‘renewed aggression’.

He said on Twitter: ‘I strongly condemn #Russia’s reckless attack on #Ukraine, which puts at risk countless civilian lives.

‘This is a grave breach of international law & a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security. #NATO Allies will meet to address Russia’s renewed aggression.’

The British foreign secretary Liz Truss tweeted her condemnation of the attack just after 4am local time.

‘I strongly condemn the appalling, unprovoked attack President Putin has launched on the people of Ukraine,’ she said.

‘We stand with Ukraine and we will work with our international partners to respond to this terrible act of aggression.’

The explosions come just hours after the U.S. warned the Ukrainian government that Putin’s troops are ‘ready to go now’ with an invasion of Ukraine, with 80 percent of Russian soldiers now assembled around the country in attack positions. .

Russia on Wednesday afternoon issued a notice to airmen (NOTAM) which closed the airspace along its northeastern border with Ukraine to all civilian air traffic.

Ukraine later said early on Thursday it had restricted civilian flights in its airspace due to ‘potential hazard’.

On Wednesday, Ukraine was placed on a war footing: A state of emergency was declared and approved by parliament, 200,000 military reservists called up, border zones were restricted and three million Ukrainians told to leave Russia, with Kyiv acknowledging for the first time that an attack could now take place anywhere, at any time.

Biden on Wednesday warned President Zelensky of an ‘imminent’ attack by Putin’s troops in the next 48 hours – , just hours after Ukraine was hit by a ‘massive’ cyberattack targeting its government and banks.

But Blinken cut that time frame of a Russian invasion drastically and said on Wednesday night he expected Russia to invade Ukraine before the night was over.

U.S. intelligence chiefs knew Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, was at particular risk of being targeted in a Russian invasion as it is close to the Ukrainian-Russian border.

On Wednesday night, a huge military convoy of more than 100 trucks with soldiers were heading in the direction of the city.",https://newswwc.com/world/united-kingdom/kyiv-comes-under-heavy-attack-as-putins-tanks-move-to-within-20-miles-of-the-ukrainian-capital/

(This is a developing story, more to come) The Belarusian military men are also participating in the aggression.

At about 6 am Minsk time, Russian aggression against Ukraine began. Russia launched missile strikes on airports, military depots, and other strategic targets.

The blows were delivered also from the territory of Belarus. The Russian equipment crossed the border. The Ukrainian military are giving the invaders a rebuff.

The website Charter97.org covered today’s events live:

Ukraine 24 TV channel, special broadcast

14:22 The address of Ukraine’s Defense Minister:

“Everyone who is ready to hold weapons, join the ranks of the Territorial Defense Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

We have simplified all procedures. Take only your passport. Only the passport. We give weapons to all patriots who are ready without hesitation to use it against the enemy! Keep tranquility! Hold the line! Believe in the AFU! Glory to united Ukraine!

14:21 The destroyed tank of the occupants near Kharkiv. Attention, 18+ video.

14:19 Coordinator of the European Belarus civil campaign Dzmitry Bandarenka:

“It can be unequivocally said that Lukashenka has turned into Motorola, into this already deceased gangster leader. The situation is wild, from the Belarusian territory strikes are being made on Ukraine. This is confirmed by the military and border guards of Ukraine. Vehicles entered, unmarked helicopters. And the kolkhoz boss (I mean Lukashenka) is still silent and pretends to be an innocent lamb.

The situation is really terrible, millions of Belarusians have become hostages of two dictators. Because it is clear that if it were not for Putin, then Lukashenka would not have stayed in power in 2020. And it is understandable why Belarusian organizations were destroyed with such bestial cruelty and Belarusian leaders, as well as thousands of Belarusian patriots, were thrown into prison. But Lukashenka is facing the fate of Motorola, Givi and other war criminals.”

14:15 Russian tanks near Kharkiv were destroyed by 18-year-old conscripts of the National Guard of Ukraine.

Oleksiy Arestovych, Advisor to the Office of the President, spoke about this at a briefing:

“Near Kharkiv, fighting is going on 4-5 km from the city limits on the north side. Conscripts of the National Guard of Ukraine, soldiers who have not studied the conduct of combined arms combat and are 18-year-old guys, knocked out four tanks of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. Which is generally a feat by military standards.

14:12 A battle with 20 aggressor helicopters in underway over Hostomel, which is located near Kyiv.

14:09 The Russian occupiers went to break through the Kyiv region from the territory of Belarus. The Belarusian dictator takes an active part in the aggression of the Russian Federation.

14:02 The first Russian soldiers taken prisoner.

13:58 A video of the destruction of the occupants' helicopter has appeared.

13:51 Another helicopter of the invaders goes to the landfill!

13:49 The General Staff of Ukraine reports that a plane of the RF Armed Forces was shot down over the Luhansk region. This is the seventh aircraft shot down by Ukrainian air defense units.

13:45 Here is NATO’s urgent statement on the situation in Ukraine:

— The North Atlantic Alliance called Russia's actions threatening Euro-Atlantic security;

— NATO is deploying additional defensive ground and air forces in the eastern part of the alliance;

— The North Atlantic Council strongly condemns the Russian military operation in Ukraine;

— Increase the readiness of forces to respond to all unforeseen circumstances.

13:39 A powerful video of Ukrainian soldiers who are on the front line has appeared.

13:30 Leader of the workers Siarhei Dyleuski addressed Belarusians:

“Guys, friends, comrades-in-arms, I urge everyone to fight Lukashists and Putin's nits. I call on everyone who is currently at work to stop working, to demand a complete cessation of hostilities on the territory of Ukraine. Because this war has already touched us. Because this war was started with the consent of the same Lukashenka. The troops were brought in from the territory of the Republic of Belarus. This means that an invader has come from the territory of Belarus and the Ukrainians can fight back. Lukashenka dragged us into the war. And we cannot deny this.

I call on all caring citizens: stop being silent. We have been silent for too long. Now it’s time to start fighting.

Long Live Belarus! Glory to Ukraine!”

13:27 In the near future, the European Parliament will consider a proposal to nullify all valid Russian visas.

13:22 Oleksiy Arestovych: The second wave of Russian air strikes against Ukraine has begun, but it will not be worse than it was in the morning.

13:18 Russia strikes with cruise missiles at a military facility in Brovary (near Kyiv). This was announced by the adviser to the head of the MFA Anton Herashchenko.

13:14 Advisor to the Office of the President of Ukraine Arestovych about the battles on the front line: We fought them very well there.

13:11 Ukrainian troops shot down the seventh Russian plane. The attack on Zmiyiny Island was repulsed.

13:10 Czech President Zeman, who was often accused of being pro-Russian, called to disconnect Russia from SWIFT.

13:00 Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Zaluzhny: Fighting is underway in the Kherson direction.

12:58 A video of the destruction of the Russian Su-24 bomber has appeared.

12:51 Ukraine has closed all border crossings on the border with Belarus.

12:46 Adviser to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Oleksiy Arestovich at a press briefing told how Ukrainians are repelling attacks from the Belarusian direction:

“The Belarusian direction: there were separate detachments of 2-3 tanks, 2-3 infantry fighting vehicles, 50 military personnel who were trying to enter our territory — they met a rebuff and retreated immediately. That is, this is an entrance-exit, we cannot say that they are advancing, the military forces are monitoring the situation there. Now the line of defense is being deployed.

12:44 Photo of the results of shelling by Russian troops of the city of Chohuev in the Kharkiv region.

12:38 The Ukrainian military repelled attacks from the Belarusian direction. Heavy fighting is going on in the Kharkiv direction.

Mariupol and Schyastya remain under the control of Ukraine.

12:34 Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the Ukrainians. Here are the main theses:

— Ukraine breaks diplomatic relations with Russia;

— Russia vilely attacked in the morning, as Nazi Germany did;

— Ukraine is already giving out weapons and will be giving more to defend the land;

— He called on the Russians to go to anti-war rallies.

12:30 Recruitment to the Belarus Tactical Group has been announced.

Taking into account that the dictator of the Russian Federation has unleashed a war against Ukraine, the Supraciu movement is starting to deploy the Belarus Tactical Group.

This is also reported by the Busly Liaciac Telegram channel:

The unit will carry out tasks to counter the aggression of the Russian Federation together with Ukrainian volunteers in the operational subordination of the command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

12:25 Ukrainian soldiers on the front line addressed the Russian occupiers:

“We will fight to the last bullet, and when they run out, we will fight with our bare hands, we will fight on the ground and on the water, and under the ground, and in the sky! None of you will return from here alive. You will all die, and our country will be prosperous and free. Glory to Ukraine!”

12:20 Destroyed Russian tanks near Kharkiv. The invaders are receiving a worthy rebuff.

12:18 Ukrainian diplomat, foreign and security policy expert of the Maidan of Foreign Affairs Foundation, former adviser to the Ukrainian Embassy in Canada and Kenya Oleh Bilokolos told Charter97.org what is happening in Ukraine now:

“Everything is more or less calm in Kyiv now. There are queues at ATMs, in supermarkets people try to take groceries for a couple of days in advance. But everything works, there is no panic. Troops adequately beat off attacks.

From the civilized world we expect not only condemnation. It is clear that missiles cannot be stopped by sanctions. We expect effective support from the whole world. First of all, help our armed forces. We hope that friends will help us protect our skies. This is the most pressing right now.

There are no reports of active actions from Belarus yet. But given the recent adoption of a joint doctrine, the threat to Ukraine's national security exists from this direction, and it is also high.

12:10 AFU soldier: Mariupol is under the control of the Ukrainian army. Don't believe fakes.

12:04 Shocking photos of the victims of the shelling of the Russian occupiers.

12:01 A shell exploded in the center of the city of Uman. Attention, video 18+

11:57 Russia is shelling Ukraine from the territory of Transnistria. The Belarusian territory is also used for aggression against Ukraine.

11:56 The State Border Service of Ukraine reports that “two unidentified targets” have approached Zmeyiny Island. The border guards are on the defensive.

11:51 Lithuania and Moldova declared a state of emergency due to the Russian aggression against Ukraine.

11:39 The Ukrainian army destroyed four tanks of invaders near Kharkiv.

11:36 From the side of Belarus, an unmarked helicopter fired at the bridge in front of the Slavutych checkpoint

This was reported by the State Border Service of Ukraine.

11:33 Ukrainian diplomat and politician, former Ukrainian ambassador to Minsk Roman Bessmertny commented on Russia's aggression against Ukraine in a comment to Charter97.org:

“Almost along the entire perimeter of the border, at the crossings, there are battles. There are fights on the front line, there are fights on the eastern border, there are fights on the border with Belarus, in the Chernihiv region. Virtually everywhere, Ukrainian troops are holding back an attack.

In the area of the front line: 5 planes, two tanks, one helo have already been shot down.

As for the night shelling: the air defense system is working, it shoots down drones and missiles over Kyiv, Dnipro, Kharkiv. Some hit the target. Airfields, air defense systems, military units, and army bases are being shelled. But the personnel of the units were brought to combat positions. Mostly communications, buildings are hit, but not everywhere.

Subversive groups are working in some cities; it is clear that they are blowing up ammunition depots. It can be seen that signalmen, sabotage groups are working. But so far, the army and air defense systems are coping with the situation.

The Verkhovna Rada decided to introduce martial law. At the moment, classes are suspended in schools and universities, they work online. During the pandemic, people have learned this.

Now the air attacks have subsided, it’s getting more or less calmly. But I say it again, there are fights practically along the entire perimeter. Now it is important for the media to look at the sources when submitting news, because there is a lot of unreliable information.”

11:26 The Ukrainian army has reported that the sixth Russian aircraft was destroyed near Kramatorsk.

11:05 Ukrainian border guards report that the Russian tanks, invading the settlements of the Luhansk region, put cars with OSCE symbols in front of their military equipment.

10:49 An explosion in the warehouses with supplies in Kalynovka, Vinnytsia region.

10:38 The Ukrainian army recaptured the city of Schastya in the Donetsk region. Enemy equipment and more than 50 invaders were destroyed.

10:36 Editor-in-Chief of the Vladometr and Historical Truth projects, Ukrainian journalist Vakhtang Kipiani, commented for the Charter97.org website on the situation in Kyiv after the start of the Russian aggression:

“There is a very powerful mobilization of society in support of independence, sovereignty, and the armed forces. Very powerful. A huge number of people are already in the military enlistment offices or waiting outside them. Volunteer organizations and foundations that support specific military units receive more support.

If we talk about Kyiv, where I am now, money can be withdrawn from ATMs, there are groceries in stores.

This morning's events brought everyone into the right tone. And even if someone leaves by car, people say: “Well, I'm taking away the kids and then I'm coming back”. We can say that it is calm in Kyiv.

Yes, there have been some unclear pats. They explained to us that it was our air defense forces that were shooting down drones and repelling attacks from the air. There have been attempts to attack some infrastructure facilities, but at the moment there is no damage, no deaths.

We now have such an attitude: not to spread fakes, but to distribute reliable information from the Ministry of Defense and the authorities responsible for what they are doing.

Of course, there is an understanding that an attack on Ukraine from the territory of Belarus is not only unfriendly, it is a criminal act. And the Belarusian elites, starting with Lukashenka and ending with the military, will be punished for this. Or according to the laws of war, or in some other order. Of course, no one will forgive them for this.

We understand that Belarusians live in a semi-fascist regime, but we expect them to find the strength to help us in various ways. For example, information about the movement of the Russian and Belarusian troops. There is no need for everyone there to throw a grenade in front of a Russian tank, but you can report to the media you trust the movement of the Russian and Belarusian occupation corps.

I think it's a matter of honor. Even if this does not happen, then I think that the attitude towards Belarusians will be the same as towards the Russians — contemptuous.

The whole civilized world is already helping us.

10:27 Meanwhile, columns of equipment of Lukashenka's troops are moving towards the border with Ukraine. A video from the Brest region.

10:21 The first information about the dead in Brovary, Mariupol, Odesa and Mykolaiv regions of Ukraine has appeared.

9:44 Editor-in-Chief of the Charter97.org website Natallia Radzina has appealed to the Belarusian officers:

“Putin and Lukashenka are international criminals. The Belarusian military men who followed their orders today and attacked our fraternal Ukraine are military criminals.

If among the Belarusian military there still are officers and people with honor — do the right thing, as your conscience tells you. You know what to do. There will probably be no second chance for you.”

9:37 Ukrainian journalist, Editor-in-Chief of the censor.net website Yuriy Butusov commented to the website Charter97.org on the beginning of Russia's aggression against Ukraine:

“There is an attack from all sides. Russia is attacking our borders. All the words had already been spoken before the start of hostilities. Therefore, we are now waiting for their implementation, realization.

Russia, a nuclear power, unleashed a war in Europe in defiance of all norms of international law and the protests of the civilized world. This has not happened before. Naturally, we are counting on sanctions that will simply exclude Russia from the civilized world, from the society of civilized states.

This is a complete break in trade, a full blockade of the movement of citizens, a break in all contacts. And that's the only way to stop it. Moreover, both in relation to Russia and in relation to the Belarusian regime, which is an accomplice in the aggression against Ukraine.

9:31 AFU reports two Russian tanks destroyed in the Shchastya area in the Donbas. The invaders are being rebuffed.

9:27 Biden spoke with Zelensky and promised to impose tough sanctions against Russia. The President of Ukraine appealed to world leaders to create an anti-Putin coalition.

9:13 The Ukrainian Rada voted for martial law throughout the country.

The speaker of the Ukrainian parliament Stefanchuk forbade the deputies to leave Kyiv: “Whoever leaves is a traitor”.

9:10 The Western leaders react to Putin's attack on Ukraine:

US President Joe Biden: President Putin deliberately chose a war that will lead to catastrophic losses and human suffering.

Only Russia will be to blame for the destruction and death that this attack will bring. The US and its allies will respond in a united and decisive way.

The world will call Russia to account.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson: President Putin has chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction by launching this unprovoked attack on Ukraine.

The UK and our allies will respond decisively.

9:04 The Ukrainian military reports that five Russian planes and a helicopter have already been shot down. The occupiers are suffering losses.

• In the city of Tulchyn and the village of Bokhan in the Vynnitsa region, military units are on fire.

• A military unit near the city of Brovary, Kyiv region, is on fire.

9:00 Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov addressed the Ukrainians. He urged citizens to remain calm, the Ukrainian army is on the defensive and repelling the Russian troops.

8:57 The Ukrainian air defense is responding to air attacks.

8:52 The Ukrainian military reported that they had shot down a Russian Su.

“The enemy is suffering losses. Hold on!” they said at the headquarters of the Joint Forces Operation.

8:49 One of the leaders of the Belarusian opposition, coordinator of the European Belarus civil campaign, presidential candidate in the 2010 elections Andrei Sannikov supported the people of Ukraine:

“Tonight, Russia crossed the line of fate and launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The entire responsibility for this crazy decision lies with Putin. No one should have any doubts: a terrible crime against humanity has been committed. Russia launched an aggressive war against Ukraine, fraught with huge casualties, including among the civilian population.

In this difficult time, I would like to express the unconditional support of Belarusians to the people and government of Ukraine. The world is on your side, you will definitely defeat the aggressor and defend your right to freedom and independence.”

Glory to Ukraine!

Long Live Belarus!

8:47 CNN showed a video of tanks crossing the Belarusian-Ukrainian border.

8:41 A Russian drone was shot down over Kyiv.

8:33 Editor-in-Chief of the Charter97.org website, Belarusian journalist Natallia Radzina addressed the Ukrainians in connection with the Russian aggression:

“Ukrainian brothers and sisters, we are with you!

In these difficult times of the war, Belarusians are on your side. We are confident that victory will be yours.

War leaves no choices. We are ready to help you with all our might. We will fight together for our countries, for freedom, for life.

And let Putin and Lukashenka be damned.

Glory to Ukraine! Long Live Belarus!”
