In Melitopol, Kherson and other Ukrainian locales now under Russian control, the Kremlin’s occupation plan is going as badly as Vladimir Putin’s plan for quick military conquest.

In seizing or surrounding urban centers, especially in the traditionally Russian-speaking southeast, the Russian president had hoped to largely rerun his 2014 invasion of Crimea, in which the local Ukrainian parliament quickly sided with Russia and helped carry out an annexation.

Glimmers of that same post-invasion playbook have been on display in recent days. Russian forces have kidnapped local politicians, created councils loyal to Russia and promised economic benefits for residents, including lower household utility rates.

But unlike in Crimea, which had little support from a central government in disarray, Ukrainians are now fighting back, quickly drawing attention to abductions and disinformation, rejecting the overtures of aid as obvious bait on a deadly hook, and undermining the ability of Moscow to create even a facade of public support.

The pushback by Ukrainians has not only upended the occupation script but shattered illusions about the Kremlin’s mastery of political manipulation, much as the Ukrainian military’s unlikely successes have shattered the image of Russia as overwhelming military power. It is also confronting Putin with an uncomfortable reality: Even if he prevails militarily, long-term political defeat is virtually certain. Unlike Russians, who have tolerated authoritarianism for decades, Ukrainians took to the streets for pro-democracy revolutions in 2004 and 2013 and, no doubt, would do so again.

Ukrainian and Western intelligence analysts have long predicted that Russia’s post-war strategy would follow a pattern set in Crimea, as well as in Donetsk and Luhansk, two Ukrainian regions where pro-Russian separatists brutalized the local populations, sowed chaos and destruction, and formed corrupt puppet regimes to govern the so-called People’s Republics.

“I know their political plan; it’s very obvious for me,” said Oleksandra Matviichuk, a Kyiv-based human rights lawyer and director of the Center for Civil Liberties, which documents war crimes.

“Their plan is to occupy territories, physically liquidate active people, find people they can appoint as local representatives and control them,” she added. “We saw this in 2014, when the war started, how they work. Nothing changed. They repeat these tactics; it’s deliberate policy of political persecution and intimidation of the local population.”

Matviichuk said that Russia’s top targets were local politicians, religious leaders, civil and human rights advocates, artists, journalists — basically “any active people who are supposed to have ability to organize or coordinate some resistance.”

In Melitopol, for instance, the occupying Russian forces kidnapped the mayor, Ivan Fedorov, and named a replacement, Galina Danilchenko, a city council member from the Opposition Bloc party, which succeeded the pro-Russian Party of Regions, the party of ex-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.

Russian forces also captured the local broadcasting tower and Danilchenko appeared in a video on local television urging local residents to refrain from provocations and to cooperate with the occupying authorities.

“Our main task is to adjust all the mechanisms to the new reality in order to start living in a new way as soon as possible,” Danilchenko said. She also announced the creation of a “committee of people’s deputies” — precisely the type of sham local council Russia has used in the past to help dispatch with Ukraine’s existing government structures.

On Wednesday, however, Fedorov was freed in a prisoner exchange. He then spoke by telephone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and issued a defiant video message vowing to return to his city and raise the Ukrainian flag over the central square.

“I want to thank everyone in Melitopol, who are not afraid of being locked up, who are not afraid of repression, who are not afraid to stand their ground,” he said. “We are free people. We are Ukrainians. We are Melitopolers.”

He signed off: “Glory to Ukraine.”

Much of Putin’s overarching occupation plan relied heavily on the success of a military strategy that envisioned capturing Kyiv, the national capital, within a matter of days.

The U.S. shared intelligence with Zelenskyy about how Russia planned to topple his government, arrest national officials, dissolve the national parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, and install a sham administration that would call new elections. Based on that intelligence, the U.S. developed plans to help evacuate Zelenskyy from Kyiv. Some analysts said Putin even hoped to temporarily restore Yanukovych to his old job. Others pointed to Yuriy Boiko, a former deputy prime minister and leader of the Opposition Bloc party.

Russia’s military may yet overrun Ukraine, allowing Putin to take control of the country. But for now, none of this has happened. Instead, Ukrainian forces led by Zelenskyy have held Kyiv and other major cities. And if the Kremlin counted on local populations, especially in the southeast, to quickly embrace Russian soldiers, it was a terrible miscalculation.

In Kherson, a strategically vital city where the Dnieper River meets the Black Sea, unarmed local residents took to the streets with Ukrainian flags to protest the Russian invasion, cursing at the invaders and denouncing them as “occupants.”

The Russian forces tried to set up a Telegram channel calling for the establishment of a Kherson People’s Republic — modeled after the breakaway People’s Republics in Donetsk and Luhansk — but it was quickly reported and taken down.

Ukraine’s Center for Counteracting Disinformation also issued swift warnings that invaders were planning to stage a pro-Russian rally in the city, warning residents: “Don’t be fooled! Don’t come close to this crowd! Don’t believe the fakes!”

With residents showing fierce resistance, going out to demonstrate even amid tanks and gunfire, Russian troops mostly retreated to positions surrounding the city, leaving it in a stranglehold. Local officials said they thought Russian agents were trying to organize a referendum but public opposition appears to have derailed those plans.

Ukrainian forces, meanwhile, continue to fight back from within Kherson, mounting a bombing campaign this week that destroyed numerous Russian helicopters parked on the Kherson airfield.

While residents of these occupied or surrounded cities and towns are facing acute shortages of food and other essentials, they have refused to accept the “humanitarian aid” Russia is trucking in from Crimea.

In Melitopol, the replacement mayor, Danilchenko, publicly thanked Chechen strongman leader Ramzan Kadyrov for assistance coming to the city after the Putin loyalist took credit for it.

“Life in Melitopol, liberated from Ukrainian nationalists, is gradually getting better,” Kadyrov proclaimed on his Telegram channel. “Law enforcement and administrative bodies begin to function, public order is established. The only problem for the locals was the lack of medicines.”

Kadyrov claimed his charitable foundation had sent 20 tons of medicines on top of 100 tons of food.

Infuriated local residents, however, only heaped scorn on the gestures. The local news outlet Melitopolskiye Vedomosti pointed out that Danilchenko had previously sworn an oath of office expressing fealty to Ukraine’s constitution.

Danilchenko, wrote local journalist Alexander Ilchenko, “promised to faithfully serve the community and people of Ukraine. It would be interesting to know what the oath sounds like … before becoming acting mayor.”

Given such resistance, and the failure of Russia to achieve many of its military objectives, core components of the Kremlin’s occupation plan now seem like a pipe dream.

Russia is nowhere close, for instance, to seizing control of the Ukrainian National Bank and halting all payments on the country’s billions in foreign debt. Nor will it be able to soon absorb Ukraine into Russia’s Eurasian customs union, a paltry imitation of the EU’s single market that Moscow maintains with Belarus and former Soviet states in Central Asia.

Other Kremlin goals are only tethered to a mythological Ukraine manufactured by Kremlin propagandists, such as a desire to promote the Russian language — a language Ukrainians already speak regularly.

In Ukraine, Russian soldiers are routinely cursed out by local residents in their shared native tongue. And Ukrainian officials from Zelenskyy on down have constantly trolled Russian officials — in Russian.

The fear now is that Russian forces, prevented from carrying out the Kremlin’s political master plan, will simply destroy cities they can’t control. Take Mariupol, for example, where according to one Western analysis, 80 percent of housing is no longer suitable for living. And in Izyum, a town in the Kharkiv region, water, electricity and heat have been cut off for two weeks.

At the same time, human rights activists say Russia’s brutality also persists in territory that it occupies, and kidnappings of local officials are continuing.

On Tuesday in Bucha, a small city in the Kyiv region, Russian forces attacked the city council building and seized six city staff members and volunteers. And on Wednesday morning, the Russian military abducted Oleksandr Yakovlev, mayor of Skadovsk, a town along the Black Sea, and Yuri Palyukh, a member of the town’s city council.

Throughout the occupied and besieged areas, residents are reporting brutal oppression that is fueling a mounting humanitarian catastrophe as they run short of food and medicine, and local services begin to fail.

Matviichuk, the Kyiv human rights lawyer for the Center for Civil Liberties, has helped her organization compile lists of Ukrainians killed, kidnapped or missing in occupied regions. They are also working with Ruslana Lyzhychko, the singer and Eurovision winner known as the Voice of Maidan, who read out the list of names on a video broadcast Tuesday on Facebook.

Matviichuk is also drawing attention to cases of abuse of ordinary citizens who are stopped by Russian forces at checkpoints and forced, for example, to make pro-Russian statements.

Dmitry Orlov, the mayor of Enerhodar, home to Ukraine’s largest nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia, has reported Russian occupiers driving around the city during the day — checking cars, breaking windshields and confiscating mobile telephones.

In a telephone interview with POLITICO, one resident of Kakhovka, a town located not far from an important hydroelectric plant in the Kherson region adjacent to Crimea, said that a 6 p.m. curfew is now in place. And even during the day, it is virtually impossible to move around because of checkpoints where Russian soldiers inspect identity documents, conduct strip searches and confiscate mobile phones.

This resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the risk to her life from criticizing the Russians publicly, said that efforts to create pro-Russian propaganda in the regional capital had failed.

“We had many demonstrations with Ukrainian flags,” she said. “They couldn’t even film a story for the television saying we are pro-Russian in the region.”

But desperation is growing.

“We don’t have a lot of food in the supermarkets now. And many people cannot get groceries, no one will take their humanitarian aid,” the Kakhovka resident said. “There are many villages here and people can survive on some things they grew throughout the year. But, for example, my mother needs the thyroid hormones, which are, you know, and many people need them here. Or anti-cancer treatments, which are not being delivered.”

“It feels like, like prison,” she said. “I can’t even bring myself to go outside because I’m so scared.”",https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-fights-back-kremlin-russia-blueprint/

Life for 290,000 residents changed overnight, and food supplies are quickly disappearing.

A 20-year-old man told Insider about trying to survive in the occupied city.

Hunger has descended upon Kherson, Ukraine, and with it, desperation.

Food warehouses in the Ukrainian city are nearly depleted and looters are beaten in the street.

The first thing 20-year-old Igor does each morning is look for food. The grocery stores are near empty now, but he continues to search.

When Russian troops invaded Kherson earlier this month, life for the young student, along with the city's 290,000 residents, changed overnight.

Just days earlier, Igor was preparing for university exams at his local maritime academy. Now, he finds himself responsible for his entire family amid a brutal occupation. With his father abroad and unable to return home because of the war, Igor is tasked with protecting and providing for his mother, younger brother, and two grandparents — an increasingly difficult job as the realities of war sink in for Kherson's residents.

Igor, whose full name is known by Insider and is being identified by only his first name to protect his safety, spoke about the everyday horrors people in Kherson are experiencing under Russian occupation as Russian leader Vladimir Putin continues to wage war across Ukraine.

Early-morning explosions

Igor has spent his entire life in Kherson, which is located 200 kilometers east of Odesa. He told Insider that his city, located strategically near the Black Sea, was once a typical Ukrainian port, known for its famous sea academy, which graduates a cohort of international sailors each year.

The city's people enjoyed their lives, Igor said. They had ""enough of everything.""

But in the early hours of Thursday, February 24, Igor woke to the news that Russia was invading his country. For weeks, Ukrainians had received intelligence that such an attack was possible, but nobody wanted to believe it could really happen, Igor said.

Despite the initial shock, he managed to stay calm. The first thing Igor did that morning was go to the store to secure food for his family — a task that would soon become a daily necessity.

Over the next few days, Russian troops moved to surround Kherson. Then, they entered the city.

As high-level explosions targeted Kherson, Igor took his family to the basement of their home; everyone carrying emergency backpacks previously prepared with small amounts of food, water, and official documents. The family sheltered together for hours that night until there was a reprieve.

In the first moment of calm, Igor said he went outside to have a smoke and talk with a neighbor. But those small acts of normalcy failed to hide the truth: Kherson — and Igor's life along with it — was forever changed.

By Wednesday, March 3, less than one week after Russian forces first rolled into Ukrainian territory, Kherson was fully occupied; the first major city to fall to Russia.

Burnt bodies in the street

As Igor stepped onto his balcony to smoke on that first day of Kherson's occupation by Russian forces, a projectile hit nearby, he said. Then, a second one.

""A man got torn to pieces,"" he told Insider. ""The entire store is splattered with what's left of him.""

Graphic photos reviewed by Insider show the mangled remains of the man's body lying bloody in the street beside a Russian tank. The gruesome site is located close to Igor's residence and a photo of an ID Igor found near the body suggests the dead man was a 38-year-old Russian soldier.

Igor believes the mounting Ukrainian and Russian corpses in Kherson — a result of ongoing fights and attacks throughout the city — are now being collected by city-appointed cars. Family members and friends of the Ukrainian dead are also collecting their loved ones.

In the immediate aftermath of Russia's invasion, Kherson's mayor, Ihor Kolykhaiev, told The New York Times that Russia's weapons left many of the city's dead unrecognizable, forcing volunteers to bury them in mass graves.

""Many of the bodies have been blown apart,"" the mayor told the outlet. ""If we can make a photograph it makes sense to try to identify them, but if not we put them into bags and bury them that way.""

On one of his daily walks earlier this month, Igor came across the charred remains of Kherson's main shopping center. After the building was bombed by Russian troops, Igor said ""black snow"" appeared to fall upon the remnants as it ""melted into plastic."" Now, Igor and his family keep a heavy-duty gas mask among their emergency supplies.

The sound of explosions and the sight of burnt bodies — once jarring to the citizens of Kherson — have quickly become commonplace.

""Now people don't pay so much attention to these attacks,"" Igor said. ""People are already used to explosions.""

Russian attacks persist throughout the city still. Igor and his family retreat to the basement during the assaults and venture above ground only when the skies grow quiet. When he walks through the streets of his hometown, Igor said he regularly sees corpses.

I doubt that when this is all over, we will be what we used to be before this war. Igor

""At first it was quite challenging,"" he said of witnessing the human toll. ""But at this point, you get completely indifferent to it; no more and no less than when you see a dead rat or cat on the street.""

""I doubt that when this is all over, we will be what we used to be before this war,"" he added.

Kherson's mayor estimated that as many as 300 Ukrainian civilians and fighters were dead in the aftermath of Russia's initial invasion, The Times reported. Reliable death counts in the days since have been nearly nonexistent.

But Igor doesn't like to think about the horrors. Instead, he keeps himself busy, seeking out ways to help his family and others. And there are plenty of problems to solve — the most urgent being the city's rapidly-declining food supply.

Dwindling food and desperation

Kherson has been completely cut off from supplies, Igor said, who added that no humanitarian assistance is being allowed in. Ukrainian officials earlier this month said the same, accusing Russia of not allowing previously-agreed upon humanitarian corridors within the city.

Life in Kherson is now all about securing food. Each day Igor starts his morning by trying to gather cash or food to feed his family and others who are stuck in the city.

Igor has become the man of the family, so the work falls to him. Kherson's women are terrified to leave their homes, he said, citing rumors of rapes and murders since Russian forces invaded.

While out on the streets, Igor talks to people about where to find food, seeking out warehouses or certain stores rumored to have supplies left. The lines at such locations are long — he said sometimes as many as 200 people have gathered to wait for limited amounts of food.

But on Friday, March 11, the last food warehouse in the city closed, Igor said. And people have become desperate.

Some citizens have tried to buy large amounts of food that they sell to people in need. Others have turned to looting.

One video shared with Insider shows a man duct-taped to a tree in Kherson as people assault him, slapping and kicking him on his bare bottom as his pants sit around his ankles.

The man in the video, Igor said, was a security guard who got caught trying to steal food from a store nearby. People in the streets took him and tied him to the tree last week as punishment.

Insider could not independently verify this account, but an additional source told Insider that she's heard of the tactic being used in response to accused looters across Ukraine. Igor said it is because there is no longer a police presence to respond to low-level crimes.

""There is no one to punish them,"" Igor said of the accused looters. ""This [punishment] is done by ordinary citizens.""

Igor said he isn't sure how the accused thieves free themselves from the displays of vigilante justice. He hasn't seen anyone stuck outside for longer than a day and posited that compassionate passersby eventually un-tape them from their posts, or family members come to rescue them.

But long hours trapped outside can turn dangerous in the below-freezing temperatures that are currently plaguing Kherson.

Average temperatures, both day and night, fall below freezing, Igor said, which makes standing in long lines for food that may never materialize particularly challenging.

Desperation among hungry civilians, already in full swing, is likely to intensify in the coming days. Igor estimated on Friday, March 11, 2022, that there was enough food left in the city to last one more week; perhaps only days for those who no longer have cash to spend.

Kherson's mayor echoed Igor's estimates, telling NBC News on March 10 that the city had only one week of food left.

Food in in Kherson is mostly gone. Courtesy of Ukrainian sources.

Once his family's reserves run out, Igor said he plans to visit nearby rivers to fish.

""We still have fishermen,"" he said. ""There are absolutely no authorities in the city, and no one forbids fishing.""

Gas and medicine have become scarce in the city, as well. Igor said he's witnessed lines at gas stations that are hundreds of cars long. He said a taxi driver told him that he waited eight hours to get only 20 liters of gas at twice the normal cost.

In a video posted to Facebook on Sunday, Kherson's mayor said the city is running out of gas, medications, and food.

Defiant demonstrations

Since the city was seized, scores of Ukrainians have taken to the streets daily to protest the Russian occupation. Earlier this month, the city's mayor estimated that nearly 2,000 people attended a protest in Liberty Square.

Over the weekend, hundreds of demonstrators gathered to protest against rumors that Russia intends to turn the Kherson region into a breakaway republic. A senior Ukrainian official in the area said the Russians are aiming to create the People's Republic of Kherson that's independent from Ukraine, according to CNN.

Igor said he knows several people who have attended the public gatherings to demonstrate Ukrainian solidarity. He posited that the wide-scale protests serve a dual purpose, with Ukrainians taking to the streets in an attempt to prevent the Russians from filming propaganda in Kherson.

Igor accused the Russians of staging fake, pro-Russia demonstrations to give the impression that Ukrainian people are eager to be a part of the country currently invading them, bringing in Crimeans to act the part of grateful civilians. In 2014, Russia invaded and annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine, and continues to occupy the peninsula.

The Russians, Igor said, prominently distribute food to these alleged interlopers to try and entice Ukrainians to join them.

It puts Kherson's residents in an impossible position. Because of the Russian presence in the city, which has Kherson occupied on all continental sides, the only way out of Ukraine for the city's residents is to go to Russia via Crimea — a Faustian bargain that Igor said few are likely to make.

Hopes for ""green corridors,"" or a humanitarian path for civilian evacuees and assistance, have disappeared. The demilitarized zones are meant to offer safe passage for humanitarian assistance to enter besieged cities and for fleeing refugees to leave.

Russia has also attacked Kherson's telecom towers, bringing the city to its knees by controlling what information is disseminated and isolating it from the rest of the world.

Igor, like many other Ukrainians, uses the messaging app Telegram — considered a more secure option than some other messaging apps — to communicate with his cousin in New York each day; a last link to the outside world.

His cousin waits anxiously for updates from her many family members stuck in the country. She told Insider she feels helpless watching the war unfold from thousands of miles away.

Burying childhood friends

Igor's current goal, he said, is to get his family to safety, and soon; perhaps to Poland, the Czech Republic, or even the US.

He told Insider his biggest fear is losing his family.

""There is no greater fear,"" he said.

Even if he can get his loved ones out, Igor said he may stay behind in Ukraine, taking care of his family's remaining business and continuing to help others who are in need.

In the last week, the 20-year-old told Insider he's buried seven of his friends, many of whom he'd known since childhood, but said he did not want to discuss the details of their deaths.

""I just want their sacrifices not to be in vain,"" he said.

Frustrations in Kherson are growing as residents decry the lack of attention on their grim circumstances. Accounts out of the embattled Mariupol and a still-resilient Kyiv lead nightly news coverage across the globe. But reports of life in Kherson have been far more scarce.

Igor said it sometimes feels as though the world has forgotten about his city.

But while food — and hope — continue to dwindle in Kherson, the defiant Ukrainian spirit persists. The city's mayor on Sunday said the Ukrainian flag still flies outside his city office.

""What hope can there be?"" Igor said.

""We will win anyway. Nobody doubts it.""

IRPIN, Ukraine — The bodies of Russian soldiers were scattered by the wreckage of charred military vehicles and shelled buildings. Twenty feet away, behind tanker trucks, Ukrainian volunteers stood watch, their eyes on a cement mixer about 500 yards away. Behind it were Russian troops on the edges of Bucha, the next town over.

This front line in Irpin, on Kyiv’s northwest outskirts, had not moved in two weeks despite the Russian military superiority. That itself was a victory for Commander Casper and his fighters.

“The Russians were trying to push forward,” said the short, burly unit leader who did not give his full name for security reasons but goes by a nom de guerre. “But they didn’t expect that the Ukrainians were waiting for them.”

When Russian forces seized control of a military airport in Hostomel, a few miles north of Irpin, on the first day of the war, many military observers expected a rapid takeover of Kyiv. But more than two weeks later, Russian troops have struggled to advance.

A visit to two active front lines — Irpin and near Brovary, northeast of the capital’s center — offered insights into the strategies, tactics and capabilities of Ukrainian forces defending Kyiv as well as apparent Russian tactical errors and miscalculations about Ukraine’s resistance.

On Tuesday, Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, announced a citywide curfew until early Thursday in what he called a “difficult and dangerous moment” as Russian forces intensify attacks.

The United States and as many as 20 other nations, mostly NATO and European Union members, have pledged to send Ukrainian forces significant shipments of weaponry, including Javelin antitank missiles, Stinger surface-to-air missiles, machine guns and sniper rifles. It’s unclear how many of these additional arms have reached Ukrainian forces in Kyiv, leaving them to rely on the arsenal at hand and adapt their tactics in the field.

“The Russians were not ready for unconventional warfare,” said Rob Lee, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute and an expert on Russian defense policy. “They were not ready for unconventional tactics. They are not sure how to deal with this insurgency, guerilla-warfare-type situation.”

To be sure, most military analysts and Western officials still predict that Russian forces will eventually encircle Kyiv and push into the capital, possibly aided by airstrikes. While this could prove true, it’s far from clear whether Russia will prevail.

For the Ukrainian forces, this war is one of attrition. They appear to be trying to slow and wear down the Russian military, creating conditions for a stalemate on the outer boundaries of Kyiv. That would buy the Ukrainians time for other pressures on Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Off the battlefield, these include tightening international sanctions on Russia and diplomatic efforts for Russian concessions. On the fronts, Putin’s forces face more Western heavy weaponry delivered to Ukraine, and growing global outrage for killing civilians and bombing residential areas and hospitals — acts that could be war crimes.

In interviews, Ukrainian soldiers also said they capitalize on the Russians’ own flaws, including the use of predictable strategies, a lack of knowledge of local terrain and even a surprising unpreparedness for a grinding conflict. Reports have surfaced on social media and on battlefields of Russian soldiers running out of food, water and fuel for their vehicles. Some have reportedly surrendered after getting lost or losing morale. Russian military convoys have slowed down or halted because of mechanical failures.

“Ukraine’s main game is a game for time,” said Michael Kofman, director of Russian studies at the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) in Arlington, Va. “To try to do something else is going to waste a lot of military potential they have available. Are they in a position to drive Russian forces out of Ukraine? No. Are they in a position to win the war? Yes.”

Across the country, Ukrainian forces have fallen back to the cities, refusing to engage with Russian forces in rural areas, out in the open. While Moscow has gained control of southern cities such as Kherson and Melitopol, it is struggling to take over nearby Mariupol and other hubs across Ukraine, such as Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Sumy.

That is also the case in the southern city of Mykolaiv, where, for more than a week now, Ukrainian forces have prevented a major Russian advance west toward the strategic port of Odessa.

In Kyiv, the seat of government, the stakes could not be higher.

So far, Ukraine’s defenders have blocked Russia’s primary effort: encircle and seize the capital, using the airfield in Hostomel as an air bridge for more tanks, armored vehicles and other weaponry. Ukrainian forces have shot down several Russian helicopters and so far have prevented a major Russian armored column from pressing into the capital. Meanwhile, a solid air-defense system has been mobilized against airstrikes and missile attacks.

“The biggest problem is that [Russia] didn’t organize a proper military operation,” Kofman said. “They thought they were just going to drive in and they weren’t going to get a fight. That led to a lot of disasters because they didn’t plan.”

Seesaw battles have unfolded in the areas of Hostomel, Bucha and Irpin — a possible harbinger of the street-by-street urban warfare that could envelop the capital if Russian forces break through.

On Saturday, large plumes of black smoke rose above the town of Bucha amid the incessant thuds of shells landing. “We have planted antitank mines everywhere,” Casper said with a laugh.

Battle for Brovary

Roughly 40 miles away, on the other side of the capital, Russian forces tried to push into Kyiv from the northeast. A column of tanks moved down a main highway toward the town of Brovary. As they passed a cluster of houses, the Ukrainian forces saw an opportunity.

They pummeled the convoy with artillery shells and antitank missiles, destroying or disabling several tanks and armored personnel carriers. Russian soldiers fled their vehicles and ran into the woods, according to videos posted on social media by Ukraine’s military. One tank slowly rolled to a halt, engulfed in flames. (The videos could not be independently verified but fit with descriptions of the battle provided by Ukrainian fighters and doctors treating the wounded.)

The ambush unveiled the Russians’ ineffective and, at times, inexplicable tactics, military analysts said.

The tanks and other military vehicles were crawling slowly on the open highway, making them an easy target. They also were bunched up close to each other, which allowed a single artillery shell to knock out multiple vehicles. There were also no dismounted infantry troops moving parallel in the woods or alongside the column to detect potential ambushes.

What was also surprising, analysts said, is that some of the tanks were generations old and not well-equipped, including the T-72, a Soviet-era tank that first entered production more than 50 years ago.

“It’s kind of bizarre seeing this,” said Lee of the Foreign Policy Research Institute. “Kyiv is the decisive mission, the decisive objective, and yet they are sending in some very old units to take it.”

The ambush also led to civilian casualties. The Russian soldiers who fled the convoy hid in nearby villages and shot anyone they deemed suspicious. Over the following two days, 23 civilians and soldiers arrived at the Brovary Central District Hospital, many with bullet wounds, said Valentin Baganyuk, the hospital’s director.

They included members of a family shot after they left their house. As the father drove, bullets hit his hand, blowing three fingers off, and wounded him in the head as well. His 14-year-old daughter was also struck. The father managed to drive to safety.

“The Russians targeted them as they tried to escape from their village,” Baganyuk said.

‘Line to defend’

Tucked inside the forests on the northwestern edges of Kyiv, Ukrainian artillery batteries have battered Russian positions inside Irpin and Bucha in attempts to slow a possible advance. The bridge connecting the capital to Irpin was demolished by Ukrainian forces to stop Russian armored vehicles from crossing.

As an added precaution, the road from the destroyed bridge into Kyiv’s center has been barricaded every 100 yards with large concrete blocks, tanker trucks, tires and sandbags.

On the other side of the bridge, at the entrance to Irpin’s center, volunteer armed groups have dug trenches on a hill with a commanding vantage point to strike Russian forces or attempt to ambush them.

In front of the hill, Ukrainian fighters wearing camouflage were positioned behind trees. Other fighters were inside buildings. They looked out on streets that Russians would need to use to move toward Kyiv.

“They have their own line to defend, and we have to keep our position,” said Igor Zadorozhny, 30, a former army officer now defending the city in an armed unit set up by Irpin’s mayor. “Right now, there is a stalemate.”

The conflict is a jumble of small confrontations, often at Ukrainian checkpoints, tit-for-tat artillery shelling and moments of heavy street battles.

“They attack our posts,” said Artiem, 34, a realtor-turned-soldier. “Then we attack them, and they run back.” Like all Ukrainian fighters interviewed by The Washington Post along the front lines, he declined to give his full name for security reasons.

He said Russian forces don’t know Irpin’s geography. At times, they make wrong turns or end up getting stuck on small streets in their tanks and armored vehicles. That has allowed Ukrainian fighters inside buildings to strike them.

The Russians “are disoriented in the city,” Artiem said.

Clutching a rifle, Zadorozhny, the former army officer, said Ukrainian forces were waiting for civilians to evacuate Irpin before “we start to clear the city” of Russians.

“They don’t have enough provisions, food, water,” he said, recounting reports from residents of Russian soldiers looting houses and stores. “They don’t have a lot of gasoline. They will get tired. And then we will go and drive them out.”

Local knowledge of the urban terrain was a major asset for Kyiv’s defenders, Zadorozhny said. “Everything, every stone, every tree is for us,” he said.

Another fighter, 32-year-old Roman, said residents have been providing intelligence to help target the Russians in areas where there is still cellphone reception.

“They are trying to take Kyiv, but they won’t,” Roman said. “Everything is helping us.”

‘Defend our positions’

With Russian ground forces slowed down, another question grows: Will Moscow escalate bombing Kyiv to pressure the government to surrender or flee? So far, the capital has largely escaped the intense barrage of airstrikes and shelling that have hammered cities such as Kharkiv and Chernihiv.

At Casper’s checkpoint, Russian forces have stepped up their attacks. Tanks fired between 20 to 25 shells, demolishing a large blue house next to the Ukrainians’ base on Friday. The Ukrainians didn’t fire back.

“Our goal is to defend our positions, not to attack the Russians,” Casper said.

Such a tactic is smart, military analysts said.

Ukraine’s military cannot compete with the might of Russian weaponry and needs to conserve a much smaller arsenal rather than waste resources on counteroffensives. Casper said they also wanted to keep the road from Bucha open to allow more civilians to flee. Firing back could turn the road into a battle zone, he said.

The Russians, he added, have sent teams to explode Ukrainian mines. But what if Russian tanks do roll down the road toward his checkpoint one day?

Casper smiled and walked to a warehouse. He came out with a British-supplied NLAW antitank missile and a rocket-propelled grenade.

“We know how to greet them,” he said, holding the weapons in his hands. “We have everything right here.”

Kherson under dispute: The Russian military claimed it controls the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson in southern Ukraine, bordering Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014.

Ukraine maintains control of Kyiv: Russian forces are about 10 miles away from the city center. The mayor has put a curfew in place from Tuesday evening through Thursday morning.

The images Tuesday at the dual-use airfield show thick black smoke rising overhead from the blazes. At least three helicopters appeared to be on fire, as well as several vehicles. At a pad further away, other helicopters appeared damaged from an earlier strike.

The Ukrainian president's office said that fighting had continued at Kherson airport on Tuesday, with “powerful blasts” rocking the area during the course of the day. They said they were assessing damage in the area, without elaborating.

Kherson is about 450 kilometers (275 miles) southeast of Ukraine's capital, Kyiv.

Meanwhile, satellite images Tuesday of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Enerhodar, Ukraine, showed no damage to the site's six reactors after Russian forces engaged in a firefight to seize the facility. Zaporizhzhia is Europe's largest nuclear power plant and the fighting raised fears about safety there.

Zaporizhzhia is about the same distance and direction as Kherson from Kyiv. Residents in the region are building barricades and setting up firing positions.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office said some 4,000 vehicles left Mariupol in the first major evacuation from the besieged southern city, but most of the convoy spent the night on the road out toward Zaporizhzhia.

HERE ARE TODAY'S KEY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR:

— Russia has stepped up its bombardment of Kyiv, as a series of strikes hit a residential neighborhood in the capital city.

— Ukraine's president is preparing to make a direct appeal to the US Congress for more help.

— Ukraine sees possible room for compromise in talks with Russia despite new assaults on Mariupol.

— US President Joe Biden will travel to Europe next week for face-to-face talks with European leaders about Russia's invasion.

HERE'S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING TODAY:

NEW YORK — Russia's Defense Ministry reported fighting near the separatist-held eastern regions Wednesday but did not comment on Russian military activity elsewhere.

Defense Ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov claimed Russian forces have destroyed 111 Ukrainian aircraft, 160 drones and more than 1,000 tanks or other military vehicles since the start of what Russia calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine.

The Russian military's daily public statements on the war focus almost exclusively on fighting in the separatist-held Donetsk and Luhansk regions, and on Ukrainian military targets, without acknowledging attacks on civilians.

KHARKIV, Ukraine — Hospital workers in Ukraine's second-largest city find themselves on two frontlines, battling COVID-19 in intensive care units as war rages outside.

The Kharkiv Regional Clinical Infectious Diseases Hospital, the city's leading facility for treating virus patients throughout the pandemic, has barricaded its windows and is adapting every day.

Hospital director Dr. Pavel Nartov said air raid sirens go off multiple times daily, forcing fragile patients into the hospital's makeshift bomb shelter.

Handling ICU patients on ventilators is the most difficult and dangerous part of the process, but also the most crucial, given the dangers of exposing oxygen tanks to bombings and shrapnel, he said.

“Bombing takes place from morning into night. Thank God a bomb has not yet hit our hospital. But it could hit at any time,” he told The Associated Press.

Kharkiv has been under sustained fire from Russian forces since the outbreak of the war, with shelling hitting residential buildings and sending masses of people fleeing.

Ukraine's official daily COVID-19 cases reached record highs in February but have declined since Russia invaded amid the chaos of war. COVID-19 concerns have fallen by the wayside as people focus on fleeing the fighting.

TOKYO — US Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel praised Japan Wednesday for standing with the US and other Western nations in announcing its latest sanctions to oppose Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Emanuel noted Japan's ban on the exports of about 300 goods to Russia and Belarus, including semiconductors and communications equipment, as well as its stripping Russia of its most favoured nation trade status.

“Japan's actions demonstrate its steadfast commitment to stand in unity with the United States, our allies and partners in Europe and around the world, and the Ukrainian people,” he said.

The US also welcomed Japan's recent decision to freeze the assets of 17 more Russian politicians, tycoons and their relatives. The number of Russians targeted by Japan's sanctions that freezes their assets now totals 61.

KYIV, Ukraine — A plume of smoke was seen rising up over western Kyiv on Wednesday morning after shrapnel from an artillery shell slammed into a 12-story apartment building in central Kyiv, obliterating the top floor and igniting a fire, according to a statement and images released by the Kyiv emergencies agency.

The neighboring building was also damaged. The agency reported two victims, without elaborating.

Russian forces have intensified fighting in Kyiv suburbs, notably around the town of Bucha in the northwest and the highway leading west toward Zhytomyr, the head of the Kyiv region Oleksiy Kuleba said Wednesday.

He said Russian troops are trying to cut off the capital from transport arteries and destroy logistical capabilities even as they plan a wide-ranging attack to seize Kyiv.

Twelve towns around Kyiv are without water and six without heat.

Russia has occupied the city of Ivankiv, 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of Kyiv, and controls the surrounding region on the border with Belarus, Kuleba said.

Across the Kyiv region, he said, “Kindergartens, museums, churches, residential blocks and engineering infrastructure are suffering from the endless firing.”

LVIV, Ukraine — Russian warships around midnight fired missiles and artillery at the Ukrainian sea coast near Tuzla, to the south of Odesa, Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko said.

“They fired a huge amount of ammunition from a great distance,” he said on Facebook.

Gerashchenko said Russia wanted to test Ukraine's coastal defense system.

He said there was no attempt to land troops. He didn't say whether any of the shelling hit anything.

LVIV, Ukraine — Ukraine said a fourth Russian general has been killed in the fighting.

Maj. Gen. Oleg Mityaev died Tuesday during the storming of Mariupol, said Ukrainian Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko, who published a photo on Telegram of what he said was the dead officer.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported the death of another Russian general in his nighttime address but didn't name him.

Mityaev, 46, commanded the 150th motorized rifle division and had fought in Syria, Gerashchenko said.

There was no confirmation of the death from Russia.

NEW YORK — The Russian state television employee who was arrested after interrupting a live news program by protesting the war in Ukraine said she was not allowed to sleep in police custody and was interrogated for 14 hours.

“These were very difficult days of my life because I literally went two full days without sleep, the interrogation lasted for more than 14 hours and they didn't allow me to contact my family and close friends, didn't provide any legal support,” Marina Ovsyannikova said after she was released.

Ovsyannikova, an employee of Channel 1, walked into the studio during Monday's evening news show with a poster saying “stop the war, don't believe the propaganda, they are lying to you here.”

In English, it said “no war” at the top of the poster and “Russians against the war” at the bottom.

In a video recorded before her action, she urged Russians to join anti-war protests and said that “Russia is the aggressor country and one person, Vladimir Putin, solely bears responsibility for that aggression.”

She was fined 30,000 rubles (about $270) on charges of organizing unsanctioned actions for her call to take part in demonstrations against the war.

The state news agency Tass said Ovsyannikova was fined for the video, not for her appearance during the news show.

She remains under investigation for that on-air protest, Tass said, citing a law enforcement source.

Tass said Ovsyannikova is being investigated under a new law against the dissemination of “deliberately false information” about the use of Russian armed forces, which carries a prison sentence of up to 15 years.",https://www.outlookindia.com/international/ukraine-russia-updates-suspected-strike-on-russian-held-airport-news-187099
