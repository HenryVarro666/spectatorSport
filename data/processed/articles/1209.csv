It is to be mentioned that the US is monitoring the situation along with the Department of Defense, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the White House. While Russia has now stopped its shelling on Europe's largest nuclear power plant after it caught fire, Russian President Vladimir Putin's troops drew global backlash over the incident which took place on day 9 of the Russia-Ukraine war.

Meanwhile, the Mayor of Energodar Dmytro Orlov said that shelling at Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant (NPP) has now stopped. The Ministry of Emergency Situations of Ukraine has said 40 people and 10 vehicles are involved in extinguishing the fire at Zaporizhzhya. Orlov also said that some suffered injuries as Zaporizhzhya NPP caught fire due to Russian shelling.

Earlier, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on Friday warned that if Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant ""blows up, it will be 10 times larger than Chornobyl"". Calling for an immediate ceasefire, Kuleba said that Russian forces were shelling on Europe's largest nuclear power plant from ""all sides"". After the facility caught fire as a result of Russian forces' attacks, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) also raised concerns over the grim developments on day 9 of the Russia-Ukraine war. The explosion at Chernobyl in 1986 was a nuclear accident which is considered the worst nuclear disaster in history both in cost and casualties.

Russian army is firing from all sides upon Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Fire has already broke out. If it blows up, it will be 10 times larger than Chornobyl! Russians must IMMEDIATELY cease the fire, allow firefighters, establish a security zone! — Dmytro Kuleba (@DmytroKuleba) March 4, 2022

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke to US counterpart Joe Biden after the nuclear power plant caught fire. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian Foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba had discussions with US Secretary of state Antony Blinken.

Australia raises concerns over fire at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant

Expressing concerns about reports of shelling & fire at Zaporizhzhia NPP, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said the dangers of Russian President Vladimir Putin's war are demonstrated by the direct threat and risks Russia is posing to critical infrastructure in Ukraine, including nuclear power facilities.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said that Ukraine informed it today a large number of Russian tanks and infantry “broke through the block-post” to the town of Enerhodar, near the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.

The Ukraine regulatory authority told IAEA that Russian infantry troops were moving directly toward the plant. “The battle is going on in the town of Enerhodar and on the road to the ZNPP (Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant) site,” the letter said, adding that the situation was “critical.”

“Russian army has opened fire on Zaporizhzhia NPP. No state except Russia has ever opened fire at nuclear power units,” said Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a statement tweeted by the country’s foreign ministry. “For the first time in human history, a terrorist state has resorted to nuclear terror. Only immediate European action can stop Russian troops.”

“Russian army is firing from all sides upon Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Fire has already broke out,” tweeted Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. “If it blows up, it will be 10 times larger than Chornobyl! Russians must IMMEDIATELY cease the fire, allow firefighters, establish a security zone!” Ukrainian emergency services officials later said the fire broke out in a training building beyond the plant perimeter.

The White House said President Biden spoke with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine this evening to receive an update on the fire. “President Biden joined President Zelenskyy in urging Russia to cease its military activities in the area and allow firefighters and emergency responders to access the site,” the statement said.

Biden also spoke this evening with Under Secretary for Nuclear Security of the U.S. Department of Energy and Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Jill Hruby to receive an update on the situation.

Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm tweeted that she spoke with Ukraine’s energy minister about the situation and the department activated its Nuclear Incident Response Team, which is monitoring events in consultation with the Defense Department and Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

“We have seen no elevated radiation readings near the facility,” Granholm said. “The plant’s reactors are protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down.”",https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/u-s-nuclear-incident-response-team-activated-after-russia-attacks-zaporizhzhia-plant/

U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said she had spoken with Ukraine’s energy minister and that the U.S. Department of Energy has “activated its Nuclear Incident Response Team” in coordination with the Department of Defense, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the White House. She added there was no indication of elevated radiation levels at the Zaporizhzhia plant, which supplies more than a fifth of the electricity in Ukraine.

“The plant’s reactors are protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down,” she wrote.

Black-and-white video footage, some of which was said to be live, circulated across social media early Thursday evening showcasing grainy images of what purported to show smoke and fire coming from buildings at the site.

President Joe Biden spoke with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky about the situation at the plant.

“President Biden joined President Zelenskiy in urging Russia to cease its military activities in the area and allow firefighters and emergency responders to access the site,” the White House said, according to Reuters.

“Russian army is firing from all sides upon Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe,” Ukraine’s minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter on Friday. “Fire has already broke out. If it blows up, it will be 10 times larger than Chornobyl! Russians must IMMEDIATELY cease the fire, allow firefighters, establish a security zone!”

The International Atomic Energy Agency said it was aware of “shelling” at the plant and wrote that it was in contact with Ukrainian authorities. The agency wrote on Twitter that the fire at the site “has not affected ‘essential’ equipment, plant personnel taking mitigatory actions.” IAEA said its Incident and Emergency Centre was in “response mode due to the serious situation.”

Just over a week after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, and the sentiment against Russia’s unprovoked attacks mount, including recent crackdowns on Russian oligarchs.

US President Joe Biden on Thursday urged Russia to stop its military activities at a Ukrainian nuclear power plant and to allow in emergency services.

Biden joined Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ""in urging Russia to cease its military activities in the area and allow firefighters and emergency responders to access the site,"" a White House readout of a call between the two leaders said.

Russian troops attacked the Ukrainian nuclear plant -- Europe's largest -- early Friday local time, with images on a live feed showing blasts lighting up the night sky and sending up plumes of smoke.

A senior US official said the latest information ""shows no indications of elevated levels of radiation, and we're monitoring closely.""

US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm tweeted that she had spoken with her Ukrainian counterpart and said that the site's reactors are protected by ""robust containment structures"" and ""are being safely shut down.""

""Russian military operations near the plant are reckless and must cease,"" she said, adding that her department had activated its Nuclear Incident Response Team.

Russia's attack on the plant drew swift international outcry, with the UN's atomic watchdog warning of ""severe danger"" if the reactors were hit and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson accusing Russian President Vladimir Putin of endangering all of Europe.
