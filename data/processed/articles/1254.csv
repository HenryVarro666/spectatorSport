04:04 am: Moscow warns of ‘symmetrical’ response to Western countries’ expulsion of Russian diplomats

Russia will respond proportionately to the expulsion of its diplomats from a number of Western countries, Russian ex-president and deputy head of security council Dmitry Medvedev said late on Monday.

“Everyone knows the answer: it will be symmetrical and destructive for bilateral relations,” Medvedev said in a posting on his Telegram channel.

“Who have they punished? First of all, themselves.”

On Monday, France said it would expel 35 Russian diplomats over Moscow’s actions in Ukraine and Germany declared “significant number” of Russian diplomats as undesirable.

“If this continues, it will be fitting, as I wrote back on 26th February – to slam shut the door on Western embassies,” Medvedev said. “It will be cheaper for everyone. And then we will end up just looking at each other in no other way than through gunsights.”

Baerbock said the Bucha images also reveal the “unbelievable brutality of the Russian leadership and those who follow its propaganda.”

The German top diplomat said “we must fear similar images from many other places occupied by Russian troops in Ukraine” and that “we must counter this inhumanity with the strength of our freedom and our humanity.”

05:59pm: Merkel defends 2008 decision to block Ukraine from NATO

Former German chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday defended her 2008 decision to block Ukraine from immediately joining NATO, rejecting President Volodymyr Zelensky's criticism as Russia's invasion clouds her 16-year legacy.

""I invite Ms Merkel and Mr (Nicolas) Sarkozy to visit Bucha and see what the policy of concessions to Russia has led to in 14 years,"" he said, referring to the alleged atrocities against Ukrainian civilians by Russian troops that world powers have described as ""war crimes"".

The Ukrainian president also accused the European leaders of seeking to appease Russia with their stance then.

07:40am: Russia says footage in Ukraine's Bucha was 'ordered' to blame Russia

Russia's foreign ministry said that footage of dead civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha had been ""ordered"" by the United States as part of a plot to blame Russia.

""Who are the masters of provocation? Of course the United States and NATO,"" ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in an interview on state television late on Sunday.

Zakharova said the immediate Western outcry over the images of dead civilians indicated the story had been part of a plan to sully Russia's reputation.

""In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements (about Russia) were made in the first minutes after these materials appeared leaves no doubt as to who 'ordered' this story.""

7:00am: UK says Russian forces continue to refocus their offensive into the Donbas region

There has been outrage across Europe over killings in the town of Bucha near the capital where dozens of bodies were found in mass graves or littering the streets near Kyiv over the weekend.

The Kremlin has rejected Western accusations that Russian forces were responsible.

EU, US prepare new sanctions against Moscow

The United States and Europe are planning new sanctions on Tuesday to punish Moscow over civilian killings in Ukraine, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy warning that more deaths were likely to be uncovered in areas seized from Russian forces.

Zelensky is due to address the U.N. Security Council later this Tuesday over growing evidence of what he call Russia's campaign of ""genocide"".

Russian soldiers withdrew from towns north of the capital Kyiv last week as the Kremlin turns its assault to Ukraine's south and east.

U.S. President Joe Biden called for a war crimes trial against Russia's President Vladimir Putin and the United States will ask the U.N. General Assembly to suspend Russia from the Human Rights Council.

Russia says it will present ""empirical evidence"" to a meeting of the United Nations Security Council this Tuesday proving its forces were not involved.

Ukraine vows to hold war criminals to account

Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said he spoke with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres about the Bucha massacre and stressed ""that Ukraine will use all available UN mechanisms to collect evidence and hold Russian war criminals to account.""

Meawwhile, Kuleba also spoke with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in a phone call on Monday, with Beijing again calling for talks to end the conflict in Ukraine.

The call, which Beijing said was made at Ukraine's request, was the first reported high-level conversation between the countries since 1 March, when Kuleba asked China to use its ties with Moscow to stop Russia's invasion.

The German government is declaring 40 Russian diplomats “undesirable persons”, foreign minister Annalena Baerbock has said, an act that is tantamount to expulsion from the country.

The announcement on Monday follows similar moves by European partners in recent days as a reaction to Russia’s war in Ukraine.

Shortly after the German announcement, France said it would expel 35 Russian diplomats as part of a joint European action. Earlier on Monday, Lithuania threw out its Russian ambassador.

Speaking as Russia faced growing global criticism over allegations that its forces had committed atrocities in Bucha, a town near Kyiv, Germany’s Baerbock said the move was a response to the “unbelievable brutality” the Kremlin had unleashed in Ukraine.

“The images from Bucha speak to unbelievable brutality by the Russian leadership and by those who follow its propaganda with a boundless will to exterminate,” Baerbock said.

Moscow said the German decision to expel a number of Russian diplomats was “unfriendly” and would worsen ties.

“The unfounded reduction in the number of diplomatic staff at Russian missions in Germany will narrow the space for maintaining dialogue between our countries, which will lead to a further deterioration in Russian-German relations,” the Russian embassy in Berlin said in a statement posted on Telegram.

Later on Monday, France announced it would expel dozens of Russian diplomats.

“France decided this evening to expel a number of Russian personnel with diplomatic status stationed in France whose activities are against our security interests,” the French foreign ministry said in a statement.

Dozens of bodies were found in mass graves or littering the streets following the withdrawal of Russian forces from Bucha.

The Kremlin has denied Western allegations that Russian forces were responsible for killing civilians in Bucha.

However, Baerbock said “similar images” were to be feared “in other places that Russian troops have occupied”.

She said it was essential to “stand up for our freedom and be prepared to defend it”.

“That is why the German government has decided to declare a significant number of staff of the Russian embassy, who have worked every day here in Germany against our freedom, against the cohesion of our society, as persona non grata,” she said.

Diplomats a ‘threat’

Baerbock described the diplomats’ presence “as a threat” to the more than 300,000 Ukrainians “who have sought protection here” since the invasion began.

“We will no longer tolerate that, we communicated that to the Russian ambassador this afternoon,” she said.

Baerbock said Germany would take further steps “with our partners” including “imposing harsher sanctions on Russia, decisively expanding support for Ukraine’s fighting forces and bolstering NATO’s eastern flank”.

Earlier, Lithuania said it was expelling the Russian ambassador and would close Russia’s consulate in the port city of Klaipeda. It said its envoy to Moscow “would return in the near future”.

“Lithuania stands in full solidarity with Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, who are victims of Russia’s unprecedented aggression,” foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said in a statement.

“The war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by the Russian armed forces in Ukraine will not be forgotten,” he added.

Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said the evidence of civilian killings from Bucha was just the “tip of the iceberg” and showed the need for tougher sanctions on Moscow.

“Half measures are not enough any more. I demand most severe sanctions this week, this is the plea of the victims of the rapes and killings. If you have doubts about sanctions go to Bucha first,” he said during a press conference with British foreign minister Liz Truss.

US President Joe Biden on Monday repeated his accusation that Putin was a war criminal and he called for a war crimes trial. Putin “is brutal. And what’s happening in Bucha is outrageous, and everyone’s seen it,” Biden told reporters.

The US and its allies have sought to punish Russia for the invasion by imposing sweeping sanctions but fear further harm to the global economy, which is still recovering from the pandemic. Europe is in a particular bind, since it gets 40 percent of its gas and 25 percent of its oil from Russia.

Putin’s February 24 invasion has left thousands of people dead, according to Ukrainian authorities, and forced more than 4 million Ukrainians to flee their country.

Putin has said the attack is aimed at eliminating a security threat and has demanded that Ukraine drop its bid to join NATO. Kyiv and its allies say the invasion is a war of aggression.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/4/germany-expelling-substantial-russian-diplomats-minister
