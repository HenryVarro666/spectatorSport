“Russia has no right under international law, as confirmed most recently by the International Court of Justice, to use unilateral force on the territory of a third country and thus bears full responsibility for these acts of military aggression and all the destruction and loss of life it causes. The perpetrators of these serious violations and war crimes, as well as the responsible government officials and military leaders will be held accountable.” said High Representative Josep Borrell in a statement on 17 March.

The European Union condemns in the strongest possible terms the Russian Armed Forces and their proxies continued targeting of Ukraine’s civilian population and civilian infrastructure, detaining, abducting or kidnapping Ukrainian journalists, civil society activists, local officials and other civilians in Ukrainian territories temporarily under the illegal and illegitimate control by the Russian Armed Forces, as well as their siege of the city of Mariupol.

Such deliberate attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure are shameful, reprehensible and totally unacceptable. They constitute serious violations of international humanitarian law. The EU reiterates its call on Russia to establish unhindered humanitarian access to Ukraine immediately.

On 17 March, the G7 Foreign Ministers demanded that the Russian leadership immediately complies with the order of the International Court of Justice to stop the assault on Ukraine, its population and civilian infrastructures, including hospitals and schools, and to immediately withdraw its military forces.

On 20 March, President Charles Michel of the European Council, talking to Italian press, reiterated the need to defend the international law. He reminded that “[The war in Ukraine] is not a confrontation between Russia and, on the other side, NATO and the EU. A very broad international coalition supports the defence of international law. We must use the means at our disposal to stop this conflict.”

Both leaders agreed on the importance of continued close cooperation and a united UK-EU response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Prime Minister thanked the President of the European Council for his work on this to date.

They also condemned the barbaric attacks on civilians, including in Mariupol over the weekend, and agreed that Putin posed a grave threat to wider European security and must be stopped.

Ahead of this week’s NATO and G7 meetings, both the Prime Minister and the President of the European Council noted the importance of maintaining pressure on the Putin regime through sanctions and providing further financial assistance to the Ukrainian government.

The Prime Minister also stressed the need to step-up efforts to supply additional defensive military support to Ukraine and continue to reduce the West’s reliance on Russian hydrocarbons.

In this regard, they are coordinating ahead of a virtual summit with the Asian giant at the beginning of April.

US President Joe Biden will discuss the issue with European leaders in Brussels on Thursday. Bloomberg, a financial news agency, added that the president hopes to ""send a joint message"" to Beijing. China's stance on the conflict in Ukraine is in the spotlight, and relations with the EU are at a key moment.

The bloc wants to encourage China to take a responsible stance, highlighting the important role it plays in international defence. The Russian invasion will be the focus of talks between Ursula von der Leyen, leader of the European Commission, and Xi Jinping, China's ruler.

Asian Prime Minister Li Keqiang and Charles Michel, President of the European Council, will also be present at the meeting. Most member states want a non-threatening approach to the issue ""as they do not want to isolate Beijing"".

A European diplomat said the EU wanted to maintain its own approach rather than repeat Washington's approach. So far, China has taken a neutral stance on the Moscow-Kiev war to avoid angering the Kremlin. However, several senior officials have defended Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Members of Biden's administration have expressed frustration with the EU's refusal to alert the East on its behaviour. Europe's economy relies heavily on exports and is concerned about the possible repercussions of its public criticism of Xi Jinping's neutrality.

Washington expects Brussels to send a similar message, as a spokesman for the US National Security Council said. A conditioning factor for this to happen is the repetition of Russian conspiracy theories regarding the alleged use of Ukrainian biological laboratories by the US territory.

For its part, the UN argues that there is no evidence to support such a claim and does not rule out Russian President Vladimir Putin taking the opportunity to use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine and accuse others.

China, too, has adopted the Kremlin's anti-NATO narrative, and Xi Jinping, in a joint statement with Russia, opposed 'further expansion of the Alliance'. Its diplomats blame the US for the confrontation as a result of the Atlantic Alliance's growth.

Bloomberg noted that Beijing has tried not to adopt the same relations with Europe that it has with Joe Biden. EU ambassadors were informed that the Asian nation is not circumventing sanctions imposed by the bloc on Moscow. Numerous companies have temporarily suspended their operations in Russia.

There are also fears that Eastern companies will fill the vacuum left by Western firms that have ceased operations on Russian territory. Brussels' position on the virtual dialogue with the Chinese leader differs from that of the last summit two years ago.

The two sides reached an investment agreement in December 2020. It is currently frozen after China imposed sanctions on European lawmakers following the bloc's actions over alleged human rights violations in Xinjiang, in the northwest of the country.

Since then, the EU has stepped up its actions against Chinese government support for economic sectors. And it ""lodged a complaint with the World Trade Organisation over Beijing's coercive practices against Lithuania"".

Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel are to express their support for the Lithuanian region and it is known that state parties have been asked to report on the recommendation to lift the sanctions imposed on Vilnius.

An invitation was not forthcoming on Monday following a conversation between Johnson and European Council President Charles Michel. The two leaders “agreed on the importance of continued close cooperation and a united UK-EU response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine”, according to a readout of the meeting.

Foreign minister Liz Truss has attended an EU ministerial meeting on the Ukraine crisis, the only UK minister to have since Brexit. Johnson’s officials told reporters that he was open to taking part in the summit, which will be dominated by Europe’s response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and will be attended by US President Joe Biden.

Johnson will be in Brussels on Thursday for a NATO meeting.

However, the UK premier’s comparison of Ukraine’s resistance against the Russian army with Brexit in a speech to the Conservative Party’s spring conference at the weekend, prompted an angry backlash from politicians and diplomats across Europe.

“I know that it’s the instinct of the people of this country, like the people of Ukraine, to choose freedom, every time. I can give you a couple of famous recent examples,” Johnson told delegates.

“When the British people voted for Brexit in such large, large numbers, I don’t believe it was because they were remotely hostile to foreigners,” he added.

“It’s because they wanted to be free to do things differently and for this country to be able to run itself.”

Sweden, for instance, has not provided military aid to a country at war since shortly after the Soviet Union invaded Finland in 1939. Germany has similarly had a policy of providing only nonlethal aid to conflict zones. Both countries are now aiding Ukraine with military weapons.

As some observers have noted, Western countries are quick to condemn armed resistance when it happens elsewhere in the world. But European countries did not react by providing support in 2008, when Russia attacked Georgia. Nor in 2014, when Russia invaded eastern Ukraine and annexed Crimea.

Something is different this time as many European countries have not only promised but also delivered arms to Ukraine.

Cultural identity

As a scholar of identity and social movements, I see the current rise of European support for Ukraine as the result of a campaign waged by Ukrainians in recent years to shift Ukraine’s identity away from Russia and toward the European Union, or EU, the group of 27 European nations that share military defense, trade and the Euro, the common currency.

In addition to Sweden and Germany, Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, France, the Czech Republic and Slovakia decided it was legitimate to provide weapons to Ukraine to resist the Russian invasion. In turn, the European Union jointly decided to further support Ukraine with military weapons.

These measures can be contrasted with how controversial the issue of supplying weapons to conflict zones in other parts of the world usually is for European nations.

Many of the countries that have now been quick to promise arms to Ukraine have strict regulations against arms exports to countries in conflict. In addition to national regulations, the European Union also has its own restrictions on arms exports.

Europe and the Russian threat

Given Russia’s military capabilities and geographical proximity, Russian aggression is of particular concern to European Union states. Indeed, neutral countries like Sweden have long considered Russia the main military threat, suspecting the Soviet Union and then the Russian Federation for submarine incursions into its territorial waters.

When I served in the Swedish army in the 1990s, there was no question that we were training for guerrilla warfare against an invader from the East – no one expected an attack from NATO in the West.

In Sweden, the sense of threat from Russia has heightened significantly in recent years with incidents of Russian military planes crossing into Swedish airspace. Many suspected that unidentified surveillance drones deployed in January 2022 over Swedish nuclear power plants and government buildings had originated in Russia.

What is noteworthy is the extent throughout Europe to which Ukraine is framed as a distinctly “European” country, whereas Russia remains the threatening “other.”

Who is European?

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that Ukraine is “one of us and we want them in the European Union.”

Russia, she explained, seeks to target “stability in Europe and the whole international rules-based order.”

European identity is determined by more than geographical location. Not long ago, European identity decidedly excluded Central and Eastern European states.

When Poland and Hungary joined the EU in the 2000s, for instance, the inclusion of them as true Europeans was tenuous at best.

The prejudice against them was exacerbated during the days of Brexit in 2020 when the U.K. was deciding whether to exit the European Union. Poles and other eastern Europeans living in Britain feared attacks from extremists groups. A spike in hate crimes occurred shortly after the U.K. decided to leave.

In July 2020 alone, more than 5,000 hates crimes were reported, an increase of 40% from the same period the previous year. The vast majority of them were directed against citizens from eastern European countries, with more attacks against Poles than against all other nationalities put together.

Clearly, something has shifted in the European understanding of who counts as “European” in only the last few years.

This shift, I argue, can be traced to the Maidan protests in Ukraine of 2013-2014. Civil unrest and street demonstrations broke out shortly after Ukraine’s then-president Viktor Yanukovych refused to sign an agreement to further integrate the country with the EU.

Some 25,000 people camped out in Maidan, Kyiv’s central square, where they were beaten and shot at by police and government security forces. Dozens of activists were killed. Ultimately, the protests resulted in Yanukovych fleeing the country and new elections were held.

Since the country’s independence in 1991, Ukrainian governments have waged a conscious campaign that has been described by some as “declarative Europeanization.”

The Zelenskyy government’s ambitions to join the EU and NATO reflect longstanding goals of segments of Ukrainian society.

Social movements do more than change political systems and laws – they change and create identities.

For Ukraine, the Euromaidan protests are often cited by experts as a watershed moment in the post-independence identity struggle between those who felt kinship with Russia, and those who leaned toward Europe.

‘We are European’

The subsequent efforts for increased integration with the EU and, eventually, membership has also led Ukraine to promote its “Europeanness” inside the EU.

At the 2020 EU-Ukraine Summit, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made that clear.

“Ukrainians are quintessentially European in terms of the values we believe in,” Zelenskyy said. “We are European in our instinctive embrace of freedom and in our deeply felt democratic principles.”

In short, the overwhelming and emotional European support for Ukraine is not simply a result of the greater scale of Russian aggression compared to 2014.

It is also related to the growing perception inside the EU that Ukraine is, indeed, European.

The Ukrainian government is well aware of the importance of this perception and makes sure to emphasize that the invasion is taking place on European soil. “Russian army is firing from all sides upon Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe,” Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, tweeted on March 3.

On March 8, Olena Zelenska, Ukraine’s First Lady, wrote an impassioned plea to the European states on President Zelenskyy’s official website.

“This is a war in Europe, close to the EU borders,” Zelenska wrote. “Ukraine is stopping the force that may aggressively enter your cities tomorrow under the pretext of saving civilians.”

The European response

EU officials themselves have until very recently been resistant to the idea of Ukrainian membership, but the Russian invasion has pushed them in the opposite direction.

A member of the People’s Party in the Spanish Congress of Deputies summed it up: “This is the West against the bad guys, the illiberal regimes, and we should be on the right side of history.”

European right-wing parties have long used rhetoric that claims superiority of European civilization. In Western Europe, right-wing groups have until recently employed it against Central and Eastern Europeans as well as non-Europeans. But they did not invent this discourse – it is firmly rooted in old European stereotypes of civilized Europe and the barbaric hinterlands.

With its latest invasion of a European country, Russia continues to be seen as barbaric while at the same time Ukraine is swiftly being embraced as part of the civilized European community, valiantly defending its independence on the frontlines against Russia, once again.

If Ukraine prevails and exists as an independent country when this conflict is over, Vladimir Putin may well have unintentionally pushed Ukraine firmly into the arms of Western Europe.",https://theconversation.com/defending-europe-how-cultural-identity-shapes-support-for-ukraine-and-armed-resistance-against-russia-178226

Leaders from the 27-nation bloc meet in Brussels on Thursday for a two-day summit focused on dealing with the fallout from the Kremlin’s assault on its pro-Western neighbour.

“Bearing in mind the destruction and enormous losses brought upon Ukraine by Russia’s military aggression, the European Union is committed to provide support to the Ukrainian Government for its immediate needs and, once the Russian onslaught has ceased, for the reconstruction of a democratic Ukraine,” the draft conclusions for the meeting said.

“To that end, the European Council agrees to set up a Ukraine Solidarity Trust Fund and calls for preparations to start without delay.”

The draft, still under negotiation, gave no further details on the planned size or working of the fund.

It called for “an international conference to be organised in due time to raise funding under the Ukraine Solidarity Trust Fund”.

EU chief Charles Michel first mooted the fund in a call with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky last Friday.

Michel said it would “help provide basic services and meet citizens’ immediate needs” and would “give liquidity for continued support to authorities and in the longer term serve as backbone for reconstruction”.

US President Joe Biden will also attend the EU summit on Thursday during a visit to Europe intended to underscore transatlantic unity in the face of Russia’s aggression and bolster support for Ukraine.

The EU has already agreed 1.2 billion euros ($1.3 billion) in emergency funding to help the Ukrainian authorities.

The bloc has imposed a barrage of sanctions that have battered Russia’s economy and also agreed one billion euros in financing for weapons for Ukraine’s forces.

EU nations are split over a next round of sanctions. Some are pushing to ban Moscow’s key energy exports, while others say they remain too reliant on Russian fossil fuels to cut the cord immediately.

The draft statement said only that the bloc “remains ready to move quickly with further coordinated sanctions” against Moscow and its ally Belarus.",https://guardian.ng/news/eu-eyes-trust-fund-for-war-torn-ukraine/
