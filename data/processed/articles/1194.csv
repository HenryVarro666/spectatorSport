A temporary ceasefire agreed between Russia and Ukraine to let citizens leave two embattled cities looks increasingly fragile, with Ukrainian officials saying that shelling has continued. Iryna Vereshchuk, deputy prime minister of Ukraine, said Saturday that Russia has violated the ceasefire agreement, which covered the cities of Mariupol and Volnovakha. In a video posted to Telegram, she said Russian forces had started shelling Volnovakha with heavy weapons around midday local time. ""I hereby state that Russia has violated [the ceasefire] agreement, failed to fulfill its duty and shells the town of Volnovaksha,"" she said, according to an NBC News translation. ""Moreover, there has been fighting in the direction between Mariupol and Zaporizhia.""

Evacuation suspended

Ukraine and Russia agreed the partial ceasefire Saturday in order to allow civilians to leave the cities of Mariupol and Volnovakha. The fighting was due to stop at 10 a.m. Moscow time (2 a.m. ET) Saturday, but there have been multiple reports of continued attacks after this time. Ukraine's Parliament said that Russia was ""thwarting"" the evacuation of civilians from Mariupol. ""The Russian military does not adhere to the [ceasefire] and continues the shelling of Mariupol and its environs. The evacuation of civilians is suspended for security reasons,"" it said. Mariupol City Council also said that shelling by Russian forces continued, and confirmed that it had postponed its evacuation of residents. ""Due to the fact that the Russian side does not adhere to the ceasefire and continued shelling both Mariupol and its environs, for security reasons, THE EVACUATION OF THE POPULATION IS POSTPONED,"" the council said on Telegram. It told residents to return to a place of safety. ""Negotiations are currently underway with the Russian Federation to establish a [ceasefire] and ensure a secure humanitarian corridor."" The council had expected the ceasefire to last from 9 a.m. until 4 p.m. local time and was planning to evacuate residents to Zaporizhzhia, a city to the west, on municipal buses.

Pronouns', 'She Her.']",2022-03-07 07:08:23.744000+00:00,"As key cities in his country were encircled by Russian troops early Monday, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy criticized world leaders for what he called silence over Russia's announced plan to open the week with a new offensive.

While it celebrated holding control of the county on the 11th day of Russian attacks, Ukraine's military acknowledged the invaders' constricting force around the capital of Kyiv and other cities including Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mykolayiv.

“The invaders did not achieve the ultimate goal of eleven days of occupation,” it said.

After being accused of violating a temporary cease-fire over the weekend, Russia said early Monday that it would propose to hold its fire beginning at 10 a.m. to allow civilians to evacuate. The announcement did not specify an end time.

The announcement, made via state-run TASS, said the the cease-fire would cover Kyiv, Kharkiv, Sumy and Mariupol. It warns Ukraine against attempts to deceive Russia, presumably during the cease-fire.

Sunday's attempt to evacuate civilians from the besieged city of Mariupol was halted for the second day in a row after Ukraine said Russian forces violated a temporary cease-fire with a barrage of shelling.

Russian-backed separatist “Donetsk People’s Republic” told Russia's RIA state news agency that the Ukrainian side had refused to guarantee the cease-fire.

Russian troops on Sunday created a ""land corridor"" from Crimea to Mariupol in southeastern Ukraine, Ukraine's Chief of the General Staff said in a statement.

Zelenskyy smarted Sunday over what he said was silence from world leaders after Russia's Defense Ministry on Sunday announced plans to strike defense industry targets.

“Just think about it, the feeling of impunity,"" he said in a translation of a video he posted to multiple platforms. ""They are announcing these atrocities ahead of time. Why? Because there is no reaction. Because there is silence.""

“The Russians began to regroup their forces,” the Mariupol City Council said on its Telegram channel, adding that “heavy shelling of the city” had resumed.

“It is extremely dangerous to evacuate people in such conditions,” the council said.

Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian interior ministry, also accused Russia of shelling the city in a post on his personal Telegram channel.

However, an official from the Russian-backed separatist “Donetsk People’s Republic” told Russia's RIA state news agency that the Ukrainian side refused to guarantee the cease-fire. The same official had earlier confirmed that a humanitarian corridor out of Mariupol had been set to take place Sunday.

Russia has consistently denied targeting civilians.

The International Committee of the Red Cross blamed both Ukrainian and Russian forces in a news release for failing to agree on the details of the safe passage. It estimated that 200,000 people had been preparing to leave the city.

Latest developments on Ukraine

For the second day in a row, a limited cease-fire is announced to let civilians leave the besieged city of Mariupol.

Officials in the key port city say no evacuations took place and accuse Russian forces of shelling the area.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warns that Russian forces could be planning an attack on the key port city of Odessa.

The U.S. begins talks with Poland about a deal to send fighter jets to Ukraine.

The World Health Organization sounds the alarm about attacks on Ukraine’s health care infrastructure.

American Express, TikTok and Netflix suspend business operations in Russia.

Officials in Mariupol, population 400,000, have sounded the alarm about a “humanitarian catastrophe,” saying Russian shelling has hit critical infrastructure and left the city without water, heat or electricity.

Attempts to move civilians out of Mariupol and the smaller nearby city of Volnovakha were aborted shortly after they began Saturday. Each side blamed the other.

However, more than 1.5 million people have now fled Ukraine to neighboring countries, Filippo Grandi, the head of the U.N. refugee agency, tweeted Sunday.

Grandi called it “the fastest growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.”

Pope Francis appealed for a cease-fire and peace negotiations in a speech Sunday, saying, ""Rivers of blood and tears are flowing in Ukraine.""

""The need for humanitarian assistance in that troubled country is growing dramatically by the hour,"" the pope said. ""I make a heartfelt appeal for humanitarian corridors to be genuinely secured and for aid to be guaranteed and access facilitated to the besieged areas in order to offer vital relief to our brothers and sisters oppressed by bombs and fear.""

Ukrainian and Russian officials agreed to create humanitarian corridors for civilians in a second round of talks last week, although no progress was made on a broader halt to Russia’s attack on Ukraine. A third round of talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators is expected Monday.

Since Russia launched its offensive Feb. 24, the progress of President Vladimir Putin’s military progress has been slowed by logistical issues and Ukrainian resistance on the ground. Russia is moving increasingly to bombard cities and towns from the air.

In a phone call Sunday with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Putin said his campaign in Ukraine was going to plan, according to the Kremlin’s readout of the call.

He said it would not end until Kyiv stops fighting and Russia's “well-known demands” are met.

Putin has previously called for “demilitarization” and “denazification” of Ukraine and insisted that the country should not be allowed to join NATO. He has also called for Crimea to be recognized as part of Russia and for separatist regions in eastern Ukraine to be recognized as independent states.

French President Emmanuel Macron pushed Putin in a call Sunday to ensure the safety of nuclear power sites and to help guarantee clear passage of humanitarian aid to Ukrainians, according to an Élysée Palace source with knowledge of the call.

Putin denied allegations that his army is targeting civilian sites and laid the responsibility of evacuating civilians on Ukrainian leaders, even though Macron reminded him that it is the Russians who are on the offensive, the source said.

Putin also told Macron it is “not his intention target nuclear centers,” according to the source. He reiterated his demands to Macron as a condition of ending the attacks on Ukraine.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told CNN that there needs to be a ""strong and clear investigation"" into potential war crimes by Russians.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken also told CNN that U.S. intelligence has seen ""very credible reports of deliberate attacks on civilians.""

""We’ve seen very credible reports about the use of certain weapons, and what we’re doing right now is documenting all of this, putting it all together, looking at it and making sure that as people and the appropriate organizations and institutions investigate whether war crimes have been or are being committed that we can support whatever they’re doing,” Blinken said.

Blinken said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that the U.S. is in talks with European allies about potentially banning imports of Russian oil.

“I spoke to the president and the leading members of the Cabinet about this just yesterday from Europe, and we are now in very active discussions with our European partners about banning the import of Russian oil to our countries, while of course at the same time maintaining a steady global supply of oil,” he said.

Asked whether the U.S. would ban Russian oil “unilaterally,” Blinken said: “A hallmark of everything we’ve done to date has been this coordination with allies and partners. We are much more effective across the board.”

Also Sunday, American Express, Netflix and TikTok announced that they were suspending operations in Russia.

""In light of Russia’s ongoing, unjustified attack on the people of Ukraine, American Express is suspending all operations in Russia. As a result, globally issued American Express cards will no longer work at merchants or ATMs in Russia,"" the company said in a statement. ""Additionally, cards issued locally in Russia by Russian banks will no longer work outside of the country on the American Express global network.""

Visa and Mastercard announced Saturday that they were suspending operations in Russia.

A spokesperson for Netflix confirmed Sunday, “Given the circumstances on the ground, we have decided to suspend our service in Russia.”

Zelenskyy said in video posted to his social media channels earlier Sunday that rocket fire had destroyed a civilian airport in the central city of Vinnytsia on Sunday.

In another video, he said Russia could be preparing another attack, this one in Odessa, which has a population of more than 1 million people. Capturing Odessa, a key strategic port on the southern coast, could largely shut Ukraine off from international shipping.

Appealing to the Russian people directly, Zelenskyy said Ukrainians wanted peace.

“This is a fight for your country, as well,” he said.

Thousands of Russians have taken to the streets to protest the invasion. Almost 3,000 people were detained Sunday at anti-war demonstrations in 49 cities across Russia, according to the independent Russia-based protest monitor OVD-Info.

Seeking to clamp down on such protests, Russia’s Parliament passed a bill introducing sentences of up to 15 years in prison for intentionally spreading “fake” information about the Russian army on Friday.

Zelenskyy also praised President Joe Biden, whom he spoke with for 30 minutes Saturday evening, and thanked him for his decisiveness and for preparing more sanctions.

Zelenskyy spoke with Biden by telephone after he spoke Saturday with about 300 members of Congress, to whom he argued the case for establishing a no-fly zone over Ukrainian airspace.

The U.S. and its Western allies have said creating a no-fly zone would be likely to put them on course for a direct military confrontation with Russia and risk a wider war.

A White House spokesperson said Saturday that the Biden administration was in talks with Poland about a deal that would involve the country’s donating its old Russian-made MiG fighters to Ukraine and replacing them with the purchase of U.S.-made F-16 jets.

Putin warned Saturday that any move to create a no-fly zone above Ukraine would be viewed as “participation” in the conflict.

He also likened crippling Western sanctions that have sent Russia’s economy spiraling to a declaration of war. That did not stop Visa and Mastercard from joining a host of other companies in announcing that they would suspend operations in Russia.

Israel Prime Minister Naftali Bennett met with Putin in Moscow on Saturday. Bennett, who told his Cabinet on Sunday that he tried to “assist the dialogue between all the sides,” revealed no details.

Israel is one of the few countries that have good working relations with both Russia and Ukraine; Bennett's office said he also spoke on the phone Sunday with Zelenskyy.

Meanwhile, the civilian casualties continue to mount. Aid agencies have warned of a humanitarian disaster across the country as food, water and medical supplies run short.

The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Sunday that 351 civilians have been killed and acknowledged that the figure would most likely be much higher.

The World Health Organization also said Sunday that it had verified six attacks on Ukraine’s health care facilities, transportation and personnel.

“Even in times of conflict, we must protect the sanctity and safety of health care, a fundamental human right,” the WHO said in a tweet.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-invasion-putin-mariupol-evacuation-temporary-ceasefire-rcna18878

As people from several countries are stuck amid the war situation in the region, the world is showing empathy towards the people of Ukraine. Russia on Saturday announced a ceasefire in two cities -- Mariupol and Volnovakha -- in order to create easy and safe passage for people who are trying to move out of the war zone.

Further, Russia on Monday allowed civilians, students, and foreign nationals to leave Ukraine's capital city, Kyiv, and three other cities - Mariupol, Kharkiv, and Sumy. Let's understand in a layman's language what its ceasefire is and what its conditions are.

What is a ceasefire?

The ceasefire is an agreement which is between two parties to stop the fight so as to discuss peace.

According to the UN, a cease-fire, a total cessation of armed hostilities, is regulated by the same general principles as that governing armistice. In contemporary diplomatic usage, the term implies that the belligerents are too far apart in their negotiating positions to permit the conclusion of a formal armistice agreement.

Maintaining geographical boundaries in ceasefire

According to peacemaker.un.org, ceasefire agreements typically hinge on specified geographical markers upon which the obligations of respective parties are centered. These may include:

Lines of disengagement;

Lines from which or to which forces are required to withdraw or deploy;

Assembly points or districts or regions within which forces are required to be confined;

Demilitarized zones on either side of lines of disengagement or confinement, or elsewhere;

The position of monitors.

Time table of ceasefire

Time plays a significant role in the ceasefire agreement. The parties have to inform about the specific time of activities and specify what is permissible and what isn't.

It is especially necessary to specify whether or when disarmament or decommissioning will take place - and how

Verification in ceasefire

Seizing arms is also one of the important factors in the ceasefire. ""A verification mechanism would normally be called into operation in regard to verifying disarmament, destruction of the ordinance, or verifying a mutually agreed downsizing, etc,"" said the UN peacemaker website.

""The purpose of a verification team is to provide a mutually agreeable neutral instrument of verification where the parties would be unwilling to allow their enemy to perform that task,"" it added.

Ceasefire violations complaints

Ceasefire violations are catered under the segment of the complaint machinery. Whether the finding should be made public or not is a matter for the agreement to specify. What is critical is that the complaints machinery should be capable of expeditious action.

Humanitarian matters in ceasefire

Demining & Civilian Protection Generally

Most ceasefires should include an obligation on both forces to remove any sources of danger to the local civilian population which they have themselves caused. Following are the factors that come under humanitarian matters:

Identifying (to the extent that it is possible) exactly where mines have been laid.

Free access by humanitarian agencies to civilians

Similarly, there could be an obligation to destroy booby troops, chemical weapons, and similar hazards.

Free movement of goods, people, and aid

Failure to secure or ensure freedom of movement can erode public support for the ceasefire, more especially the support of local communities.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Evgeniy Maloletka/AP Evgeniy Maloletka/AP

The southeast Ukraine city of Mariupol has been battered by Russian airstrikes in recent weeks. Among the buildings hit have been a maternity hospital, a theater and an arts school. At least 2,000 civilians have died and some 80% of homes have been destroyed, according to city officials. Some 7,000 people were evacuated by convoy from Mariupol on Tuesday.

The result is a harrowing humanitarian crisis as Ukrainians shelter in basements, and safe passage out of the city for civilians is limited and sporadic.

Why is this city so important? There are several reasons — for the Russian military and for the people of Ukraine.

For Russia, Mariupol is a major port city in a key location

1. The city is in a strategic place militarily.

Mariupol is located between Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, and the region of Eastern Ukraine called Donbas, much of which was already controlled by Russian-backed separatists.

Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized the ""independence"" of two enclaves there prior to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Those are the two areas — so-called Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics — that have faced Russian aggression since 2014.

""Mariupol is right in between them. So taking Mariupol is part of the campaign in the south and the southeast to connect the Russian-held areas, essentially,"" Rita Konaev, an expert on the Russian military at Georgetown University, tells NPR.

By controlling Mariupol, Russia could potentially create a land bridge to Crimea and control the entire north shore of the Sea of Azov.

Russia hopes to hem in Ukrainian forces in the east and southeast of the country, a senior U.S. defense official said in a call with reporters on Tuesday. This could prevent the Ukrainian troops there from going to help in other parts of the country, particularly Kyiv, the official said.

2. As a port city, Mariupol is important economically.

Mariupol has long been an important industrial port city. In peacetime, it is a major site for exporting Ukrainian steel and grain.

That status has already been altered by war, says Liam Collins, a retired colonel with U.S. Army Special Forces who has trained Ukrainian forces. With Mariupol under siege, it's not able to currently produce for the war effort, he tells NPR.

The major impact would come if a negotiated settlement partitions off part of Ukraine, says Collins: ""Ukraine's not going to want to do that after 2014 and 2015 [when Russia essentially took part of Eastern Ukraine], but it's always a possibility.""

If Russia effectively cuts off Mariupol for the long term, and with it access to the Sea of Azov, it will damage Ukraine's finances and economic sustainability, hindering the country's ability to sell and ship its products.

""It's part of a broader effort to effectively cut Ukraine off from access to the sea, which is a really important part of Ukrainian economy and trade,"" Konaev says.

3. Taking Mariupol would be a boon to Russian morale.

If Russia succeeds in controlling Mariupol, it would be a major morale boost for Russia.

That's because, according to Konaev, the campaign in Ukraine ""has not been going in any way that Russia has imagined and they've encountered significant military challenges. And they haven't had a real victory since they've taken Kherson, which is nearby, and even there, it remains contested.""

""So at this point, they feel that it is effectively necessary to take Mariupol in order to maintain morale and keep the campaign going,"" Konaev says.

Collins says capturing Mariupol would be notable for Russia — it not only ""shows that you're having success, but it shows that you control a larger city.""

There's also the possibility that Russian President Vladimir Putin could capitalize on taking Mariupol with specific propaganda. The Azov Regiment, a unit with neo-Nazi origins that has been folded into Ukraine's National Guard, is present in Mariupol. Because Putin has repeatedly and incorrectly framed his invasion of Ukraine as a denazification effort, winning Mariupol could provide new fodder for his false narrative.

4. If negotiations happen, new boundaries could be drawn.

At some point down the road, there could be negotiations — perhaps to achieve a cease-fire — in which new boundary lines are drawn.

Which areas are held by Russian forces could shape where a theoretical new line could be drawn. And if Mariupol falls to Russia, new lines could mean that it ends up as part of a Donbas that is controlled by Russia or as an independent republic, recognized by Russia.

But this isn't a war that Russia will win by conquering a certain amount of territory, Collins says. ""There are no winners in this. It's war. Both nations are going to lose regardless of the outcome. It's just a matter of which one loses more.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Evgeniy Maloletka/AP Evgeniy Maloletka/AP

For Ukraine, Mariupol has been inspiring — and losing it could make the war effort harder.

1. The Ukrainian army's resistance there has been a fuel for the Ukrainian people.

The Russian bombs have been terrifying and brutal for the people of Mariupol. And the grit that the city's residents have shown has been a source of inspiration to other Ukrainians. ""Right now Mariupol is this legendary stronghold of resistance,"" says Konaev, ""and I think it's fueling resistance everywhere else.""

If Ukraine's military is able to hold on to Mariupol, it could set the tone for the rest of the country.

""That would just really amplify that David and Goliath story and could feel like a turning point,"" she says. While that might not be the decisive factor in a protracted campaign, she says it could be important in shaping the narrative around the war.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Anadolu Agency via Getty Images Anadolu Agency via Getty Images

2. The humanitarian disaster could get worse if Russia takes the city.

Losing Mariupol to Russia would likely add further misery and devastation for the city's residents.

The city had already become home to many internally displaced Ukrainians who fled the fighting in Donetsk and Luhansk in 2014. ""That secondary displacement is very difficult on people,"" says Konaev.

More than 41,000 people have fled the city in recent days, according to Mariupol city officials. But humanitarian corridors remain tenuous, and safe passage is far from certain.

3. It's not clear what Russia ""owning"" Mariupol would look like.

What would it look like for Russian troops to take — and control — Mariupol? It's likely, says Collins, that low-grade fighting would continue for a long time.

""Even if Russia gets to the point of so-called 'owning' it,"" says Collins, ""they most likely will come under significant attack from the various volunteers that are in the city.""

But Konaev doesn't think Russia needs to physically occupy Mariupol and other cities to achieve its aims.

""I don't think that they intend to occupy these cities,"" she says. ""I think they intend to make some of them unlivable, so they can declare victory. And then use that as leverage to get whatever they want in the negotiations.""",https://www.npr.org/2022/03/23/1088113318/what-mariupol-means-ukraine-russia-military-campaign

March 5 (Reuters) - A partial ceasefire by Russian forces around the Ukrainian city of Mariupol will allow civilians to leave the city during a five-hour period from Saturday morning, the city authorities said.

Civilians will be allowed to leave Mariupol between noon and 5 p.m. Moscow time (0900 - 1400 GMT), Russia's RIA news agency quoted city authorities as saying.

Russia said earlier on Saturday its troops, which have encircled the Azov Sea port city in Ukraine's south, would stop firing and allow civilians to pass. Russia also plans a partial ceasefire to allow a humanitarian corridor out of Volnovakha.

In a statement, the city council asked residents to return to shelters in the city and await further information on evacuation.

In a televised broadcast, Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said Russia was not observing an agreed ceasefire in some areas, preventing a joint plan to allow civilians to evacuate.

Meanwhile, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, accused the Nato alliance of bending to Russian pressure and said it was not the force that Ukrainians had previously imagined. Speaking on Ukrainian television, he said he was open to talks with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, but only if they were “meaningful”.

The Russian defence ministry said its units had opened humanitarian corridors near Mariupol and Volnovakha, a smaller city 40 miles (65km) to the north, on Saturday morning. Evacuations from Mariupol had been due to begin at 11am local time (0900 GMT).

01:13 Footage shows devastated town of Volnovakha, Ukraine – video

Located on the Sea of Azov, the city of 450,000 people has become the scene of growing misery amid days of shelling that has knocked out power and most phone service and raised the prospect of food and water shortages for hundreds of thousands of people in freezing weather. The city represents a potential strategic advantage for Moscow’s invasion, connecting it to the Russian forces coming from annexed Crimea, as well as to the troops in the Donbas.

In Volnovakha, the attack is still so intense that dead bodies lie uncollected, those hiding in shelters are running out of food, and about 90% of the city has been damaged by bombing, local MP Dmytro Lubinets said.

Before the postponement, the Ukrainian government said the plan was to evacuate about 200,000 people from Mariupol and 15,000 from Volnovakha, and that the Red Cross would act as the ceasefire’s guarantor. An adviser to Ukraine’s interior ministry said there would be agreements on humanitarian corridors for other cities.

Turkey said the humanitarian ceasefires declared by Russia should be countrywide and lasting. The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, said evacuation and aid shipment corridors must be opened across the country and that it was working to evacuate its citizens in Ukraine by bus and train.

The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, was due to speak to Vladimir Putin by phone on Sunday. A spokesperson said Turkey was ready to help resolve the crisis.

Putin said on Saturday that western sanctions on Russia were akin to a declaration of war and warned that any attempt to impose a no-fly zone in Ukraine would lead to catastrophic consequences for the world.

Putin reiterated that his aims were to defend Russian-speaking communities through the “demilitarisation and de-nazification” of the country so that Russia’s former Soviet neighbour becomes neutral and no longer threatens Russia.

Ukraine and western countries have dismissed this as a baseless pretext for the invasion he launched on 24 February and imposed a sweeping range of sanctions aimed at isolating Moscow.

“These sanctions that are being imposed are akin to a declaration of war, but thank God it has not come to that,” Putin said, speaking to a group of flight attendants at an Aeroflot training centre near Moscow.

Mariupol and Volnovakha are just two of many cities across Ukraine left reeling by a devastating campaign of shelling and artillery from Russian forces. The Russian defence ministry said on Saturday a broad offensive would continue elsewhere in Ukraine.

Ukraine said Russian forces were trying to encircle the capital, Kyiv, and Kharkiv, the country’s second biggest city, while attempting to set up a land bridge to Crimea.

Authorities in Sumy, about 190 miles east of Kyiv, reportedly urged residents to stay inside shelters, warning there could be fighting in the city’s streets.

Russian forces have taken control of a psychiatric hospital in the town of Borodyanka in Ukraine’s Kyiv region, with 670 people inside, the regional governor Oleksiy Kuleba told local media on Saturday.

“Today we do not understand how to evacuate these people, how to help them,” Kuleba said. “They are running out of water and medicines,” he said. “These are people with certain special needs, they need constant help … Many of them have been bedridden for years.”

The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, made a “desperate plea” for eastern Europe to provide Russian-made aircraft to Ukraine during a call with US senators on Saturday, said the chamber’s majority leader, Chuck Schumer. “These planes are very much needed. And I will do all I can to help the administration to facilitate their transfer,” Schumer said in a statement.

On Friday night Zelenskiy had lashed out at Nato for ruling out a no-fly zone, saying it gave a “green light for further bombing of Ukrainian cities and villages”.

“All the people who die from this day forward will also die because of you, because of your weakness, because of your lack of unity,” the Ukrainian president said in an emotional address, in which he praised the bravery of the Ukrainian resistance.

Nato said on Friday that a no-fly zone could provoke full-fledged war in Europe with nuclear-armed Russia, causing far greater loss of life.

As people flee the crisis, a humanitarian disaster is unfolding, with more than 1.3 million people seeking refuge in western Ukraine and neighbouring countries. The UN security council will hold an emergency meeting Monday on the humanitarian crisis triggered by the invasion, diplomats said on Friday.

In Russia, Putin’s crackdown on independent and critical voices has intensified, as the government moves to silence dissent and tighten its grip on the flow of information. The Russian president introduced new laws and regulations cracking down on the free press and social media sites, prompting an exodus of broadcasters and publishers from the country.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/05/zelenskiy-lashes-out-at-nato-over-no-fly-zone-as-russian-attacks-intensify
