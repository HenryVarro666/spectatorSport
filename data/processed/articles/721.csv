Russia brutally bombs school where 400 women, kids and elderly people were sheltering

Russian forces brutally bombed a school where 400 women, children and elderly were sheltering in stricken Mariupol today.

The art school was reduced to rubble and rescuers are trying to pull out people trapped under the debris- as the community is still trying to rescue victims of the earlier theatre bombing.

So far only 130 people out of more than 1,000 feared trapped under the Mariupol theatre last Wednesday have been rescued.

Ukraine officials believe 2,300 people have died in the Mariupol siege and those remaining are starving and suffering a lack of water.

There was no news tonight on the fate of those trapped in the school bombing.

And there is increasing alarm over the fate of those locals who manage to escape the hell of Mariupol.

The city council revealed Russian troops are kidnapping civilians, possibly as many as 5,000 so far, and processing them into Russia, confiscating their passports.

Officials revealed in a statement: ""Over the past week, several thousand Mariupol residents were deported onto the Russian territory.”

Russian news agencies have said buses have carried several hundred people Moscow calls refugees from Mariupol to Russia in recent days.

Meanwhile in the eastern city of Kharkiv, officials say at least five civilians have been killed in renewed Russian shelling.

In the capital Kyiv a large plume of smoke rose above the capital after enormous explosions were - possibly the interception of an incoming missile by ground defence systems.

Air raid sirens sounded across Ukrainian cities on Sunday and Russia confirmed cruise missiles were launched from ships in the Black Sea and Caspian Sea, as well as hypersonic missiles from Crimean airspace.

The hypersonic missiles travel faster than five times the speed of sound and their speed, manoeuvrability and altitude make them difficult to track and intercept.

They were deployed by Russia for the first time in Ukraine on Saturday. Russia's Interfax news agency reported, in a strike which Moscow said destroyed a large underground depot for missiles and aircraft ammunition.

A Daily Mirror team which visited Delyatyn, where the missile hit a Soviet-era ammo dump, saw no evidence of the strike on Friday.

But today Russia said it had fired a second hypersonic Kinzhal missile on “military targets.”

Russia’s ministry of defence said: “A Kinzhal attack on a fuel and lubricants base from which fuel for Ukrainian armoured vehicles was launched from airspace over Crimea.”

A spokesperson for the Ukrainian Air Force Command confirmed the Friday attack in the western Ivano-Frankivsk region.

And all over the country Ukraine’s security service and troops were hunting down Russian saboteurs and spies trying to infiltrate society and spark mayhem or call in airstrikes.

Ukraine’s border guards seized two Russian spies in Kharkiv who had apparently been sent on a sabotage mission.

Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said seven humanitarian corridors would open on Sunday to enable civilians to leave frontline areas. Ukraine has so far evacuated a total of 190,000 people.

According to Ukraine official figures Russia’s military has lost almost 15,000 troops in 25 days of fierce fighting and failing to gain a single city during the invasion. It also claims Moscow has lost 96 warplanes - plus well-over 400 tanks.

Today Moscow lost another top commander, Black Sea Captain Andrey Paliy, 51- the first senior Russian navy officer killed. He was shot dead in fighting and it is believed he was among a number of Russian marines trying to storm Mariupol.

Paliy was born in Kyiv but in 1993 refused to take the Ukrainian military oath and joined the Russian forces instead.

So far Russia has seen five of its generals killed in the 25 day invasion.

Desperate Moscow leaders have signed off a decree to send adolescents to war after defence minister Sergei Shoigu ordered it.

Both he and Putin are preparing to allow 17-18 year-olds from a Russian youth movement to be called up to the frontline to join the fighting.

And Russian troops frustrated by their lack of progress are increasingly resorting to single acts of ruthless violence against civilian Ukrainians.

In Luhansk officials claimed a Russian tank opened fire on a care home killing 56.

In the community of Trostyanets, in the Sumy region Russian troops hurled a grenade at passers-by, killing two men, local prosecutors reported.

Not far away in the same region Russian soldiers shot dead a family delivering bread by car, according to Sumy military-civil administration chief Dmitry Zhyvytskyi.

Impoverished locals in the Krasnopil community refused to accept offers of food and aid from Russian forces.

Zhyvytskyi added: “I personally talked to a wounded woman at a hospital and the Russian military stitched her with a machine gun.”",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russia-brutally-bombs-school-400-26514600

It is the 26th day of the war.

Having failed all plans to occupy Ukraine, the Russian aggressor resorted to outright genocide of the civilian population of Ukraine.

In the last two days alone, the enemy has bombed from air the House of Arts in Mariupol. They opened direct fire from tanks at a nursing home in Luhansk region. In Trostyanets, Sumy region, the occupiers threw a live grenade at civilians. In Kyiv, a shopping center where civilian population were hiding was attacked from the air.

As a result of the war, millions of Ukrainians were forced to flee their homes. Millions were left homeless. This is our reality that the entire civilized world can already see.

President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced a substantial program to help Ukrainians who were forced to escape from their war-torn towns.

The Government has embarked on implementation of this program.

Money, jobs, housing are the three main directions covered by this program.

***

First. Money. The state will pay each displaced in Ukraine a minimum monthly allowance of 2,000 hryvnias. Simply, through the Diia, to the bank account. No extra documents. Avoiding bureaucracy. For all the citizens who moved from areas of active hostilities.

Also, a 3,000 hryvnias resource will be paid for each child who was forced to move to safer regions because of the war and all those atrocities.

***

Second. Jobs. We are launching an employment program for all the displaced persons. To do this, the state commences payment of benefits to those employers who hire IDPs from the affected regions.

A 6,500 hryvnias sum for each employee. These funds will be spent by employers on the salaries for such employees.

I will appeal to entrepreneurs again.

The state supports you in your desire to continue working where it is safe. Complete deregulation of business, simplification of the tax system, affordable loans.

Now the Government bears part of the resources for paying wages to those people who need work. Hence, let's get work! I urge everyone to start working, to admit people, to provide them with work.

***

Third. Housing. A week ago, the Government adopted a decision on a mechanism to reimburse utility costs to communities that provide free shelter to IDPs in schools, kindergartens, cultural centers and municipal institutions.

We are now working to supplement the program so that families receiving displaced persons in their homes can also get compensation for utility bills.

All those who responded to the hardship the IDPs face, provided them with shelter for free, will receive 450 UAH per month for each of those whom they helped to compensate while paying for utilities.

***

All the three programs have already been approved by the Government of Ukraine. Their implementation triggers today, March 21, with the registration of temporary displaced persons by territorial communities and CASPs.

Registration through the Diia will be available starting March 30.

***

And after the war ends we will rebuild everything. Every building, every apartment, every facility. And everyone will have a chance to return home.

But everyone who today has found shelter, work and everything necessary for life in this time of trials will forever keep in their hearts the memory of and gratitude to those hospitable communities and people.

***

We will never forget that either.
