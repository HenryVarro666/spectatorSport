And when Biden traveled to Europe last week — his first visit there since the invasion began — he announced an additional $1 billion in humanitarian assistance and pledged that the United States would accept up to 100,000 refugees fleeing Ukraine.

The Biden administration’s budget plan, released on Monday, also calls for an additional $682 million for Ukraine, “to counter Russian malign influence and to meet emerging needs related to security, energy, cybersecurity issues, disinformation, macroeconomic stabilization, and civil society resilience.”

In their call on Wednesday, Biden and Zelenskyy discussed “how the United States is working around the clock to fulfill the main security assistance requests by Ukraine, the critical effects those weapons have had on the conflict, and continued efforts by the United States with allies and partners to identify additional capabilities to help the Ukrainian military defend its country,” according to the White House readout.

Zelenskyy, in his own summary of the roughly hourlong conversation, tweeted that he shared with Biden his “assessment of the situation on the battlefield and at the negotiating table.” The leaders also discussed “specific defensive support, a new package of enhanced sanctions, [and] macro-financial and humanitarian aid,” according to Zelenskyy.",https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/30/biden-additional-aid-ukraine-zelenskyy-00021700

Biden and Zelenskyy held a call Wednesday in which the funds were discussed, according to a White House readout of the call.

The U.S. president said America ""intends to provide the Ukrainian government with $500 million in direct budgetary aid.""

Last week, the U.S. announced a package of new sanctions against Russia on more than 400 Russians and Russian entities, including the Duma and more than 300 of its members, along with more than 40 defense companies.

The White House also announced it would allow as many as 100,000 Ukrainian refugees to enter the U.S., with a focus on those who are most vulnerable. The administration is also prepared to offer more than $1 billion in additional funding toward humanitarian assistance and $11 billion over the next five years to address worldwide food security threats after the disruptions to the Russian and the Ukrainian agricultural industries.

Biden and Zelensky spoke over the phone for nearly an hour, the latest communication between the two leaders about the response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The two talked about U.S. efforts to provide military, economic and humanitarian assistance, according to a White House readout.

“The leaders discussed how the United States is working around the clock to fulfill the main security assistance requests by Ukraine, the critical effects those weapons have had on the conflict, and continued efforts by the United States with allies and partners to identify additional capabilities to help the Ukrainian military defend its country,” the White House said in its statement.

He also reviewed the additional sanctions and humanitarian assistance announced last week. President Zelenskyy updated President Biden on the status of Ukraine’s negotiations with Russia.”

The budgetary aid intends to keep the Ukrainian government and economy stable as the invasion enters its second month.

Biden was in Europe last week, where he announced the U.S. would provide an additional $1 billion in humanitarian aid to assist with the millions of refugees who have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded more than one month ago.

The U.S. has also provided a total of $1 billion in military aid since the invasion began, supplying Ukraine with anti-tank and anti-aircraft defense systems, small arms and other weapons to defend itself against Russia.

Zelensky has asked Western nations for additional support, and the White House readout indicated the Biden administration may provide more defense systems in the days to come.

The White House later clarified to Fox News that the $500 million was new funding. It comes in addition to the $800 million in security assistance announced by the White House on March 16, which brought the total committed to Ukraine in that past week alone to $1 billion.

According to the White House, Biden spoke to Zelenskyy ""about the ongoing work by the United States and its allies and partners to deliver military, economic and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and to impose severe costs on Russia for its brutal aggression against Ukraine.""

""The leaders discussed how the United States is working around the clock to fulfill the main security assistance requests by Ukraine, the critical effects those weapons have had on the conflict and continued efforts by the United States with allies and partners to identify additional capabilities to help the Ukrainian military defend its country,"" a White House readout said.

Zelenskyy tweeted that he finished the call, revealing that he ""shared assessment of the situation on the battlefield and at the negotiating table"" and ""talked about specific defensive support, a new package of enhanced sanctions, macro-financial and humanitarian aid.""

The call came after Ukrainian and Russian delegations met in Istanbul, Turkey Tuesday for the first in-person discussion in nearly three weeks as the situation on the ground changed to a war of attrition.

Russia’ deputy minister of defense told reporters in Moscow Tuesday that Russian forces would withdraw from Kyiv and Chernihiv to establish goodwill during the talks, but defense experts warned Fox News that Moscow was simply buying time to reorganize its troops. Russian forces continued their shelling overnight of several Ukrainian cities. By Wednesday, the defense ministry announced it would ""resume"" offensive operations, meaning forward movement on the ground.

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Wednesday that Russian units have been ""repositioning"" around Kyiv in the past 24 hours and also have been moving north into Belarus, noting that the Russians themselves have said they are going to prioritize eastern Ukraine in the Donbas region.

Kirby also spoke about U.S. European Command Commander Gen. Tod Walters’ testimony before Congress Tuesday, saying that some 100 kamikaze switchblade drones promised by Biden have been delayed. In an interview with Stuart Varney, Kirby blamed ""inventory"" and ""modality"" issues, saying he’s expecting shipments of the tactical unmanned systems to arrive in Ukraine ""relatively soon.""

The announcement comes after Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that the Biden administration was considering providing Ukraine with the $500 million in aid and pushing European allies to match its contribution. Reuters reported that the United States and its allies were discussing providing as much as $500 million collectively.

The United States has rolled out several rounds of aid to Ukraine in recent weeks, as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s assault on the country has dragged on for more than a month and Ukrainian forces have remained largely successful in repelling the Russian invaders.

Following Zelenskyy’s impassioned address to Congress earlier this month, the administration announced an additional $800 million in security assistance to Ukraine, bringing the total amount of U.S. contributions to Ukraine since the start of the Biden administration to roughly $2 billion.

US President Joe Biden told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a 55 minute call Wednesday that the additional aid was on its way.

The leaders also reviewed security aid already delivered to Ukraine and the effects that weaponry has had on the war, according to the White House.

Zelenskyy has pressed the Biden administration and other Western allies to provide Ukraine with military jets.

The US and other NATO countries have thus far been unwilling to accommodate that request out of concern it could lead to Russia broadening the war beyond Ukraine's borders.

Prior to Wednesday's announcement of $500 million in aid, the Biden administration had sent Ukraine about $2 billion in humanitarian and security assistance since the start of the war last month.

That's all part of the $13.6 billion that Congress approved earlier this month for Ukraine as part of a broader spending bill.
