WASHINGTON, March 9 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund's executive board on Wednesday approved $1.4 billion in emergency financing for Ukraine to help meet urgent spending needs and mitigate the economic impact of Russia's military invasion, the IMF said.

The global lender said Ukrainian authorities had canceled an existing stand-by lending arrangement with the IMF, but would work with the fund to design an appropriate economic program focused on rehabilitation and growth when conditions permit.

""The Russian military invasion of Ukraine has been responsible for a massive humanitarian and economic crisis,"" IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said in a statement after the meeting, predicting a deep recession in Ukraine this year.

""Financing needs are large, urgent, and could rise significantly as the war continues,"" she said. Once the war was over, Ukraine was likely to need additional ""large support.""

Vladyslav Rashkovan, Ukraine's alternate executive director at the fund, gave an emotional and deeply personal speech at the board meeting about the devastation caused by the war and its impact on its people, a source familiar with the meeting said.

His remarks were met with spontaneous applause, a rare event at such meetings. In its statement on the new funding, the board also expressed its ""strong support for the Ukrainian people.""

Russian Executive Director Aleksei Mozhin, who is the board's most senior member and serves as its honorary dean, spoke only briefly, telling board members: ""I pray for peace,"" the source said.

The IMF said the war had already resulted in very serious consequences, citing the flight of over 2 million people from the country in 13 days and large-scale destruction of key infrastructure.

Russia calls the assault a ""special military operation.""

The disbursement under the IMF's Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI), equivalent to 50% of Ukraine's quota in the IMF, will help fund urgent spending needs in the short term, while helping to catalyze financing from other partners, the IMF said.

The RFI provides rapid funding to IMF member countries without the need for a full-fledged program. Members can tap the RFI repeatedly within any three-year period if the balance of payments need is caused by an exogenous shock, according to the IMF website.

It comes on top of $700 million disbursed to Ukraine by the IMF in December, and $2.7 billion in IMF Special Drawing Rights, or emergency reserves, that Ukraine received as part of an IMF allocation in August.

The World Bank's executive board on Monday approved a $723 million package of loans and grants for Ukraine. read more

Amidst the worsening conflict in Ukraine, Ukrainian activists and international allies have called for the country’s unsustainable debts to be written off – including those owed to multilateral institutions such as the IMF and World Bank.

Ukraine’s external debt stood at $56.7 billion at the end of 2020, according to the IMF. Jubilee USA executive director Eric LeCompte noted in a 8 March article in Barron’s magazine that Ukraine owed $22 billion to international finance institutions (IFIs), stating: “The IMF holds more than a half of that…debt at $13.4 billion with $2 billion in debt payments owed this year…. Since Ukraine will most likely default on these payments, the IMF should act quickly to restructure the payments.”

The Fund’s executive board subsequently approved a $1.4 billion loan to Ukraine on 9 March via its Rapid Financing Instrument, while the World Bank also released a $723 million financing package on 7 March, including $589 million in new loans. While this financing provides much needed emergency support, it increases Ukraine’s substantial debt load further.

Ukraine is also being charged significant surcharges on its loans by the IMF, as a result of its borrowing being in excess of its IMF quota allowance (see Observer Spring 2022, Winter 2021). According to Belgium-based civil society network Eurodad, Ukraine is projected to pay $178 million in surcharges in 2022 alone.

“It just doesn’t make sense for countries like Ukraine to send tens of millions of dollars every month to fund the IMF in Washington as they confront war, pandemic, and economic crisis,” said US Congressman Jesús “Chuy” García, in a March press release announcing a new bill aimed at getting the US Treasury to support a suspension of IMF surcharges, pending a review.",https://www.brettonwoodsproject.org/2022/04/calls-for-ukraine-debt-relief-grow-as-imf-and-world-bank-provide-fresh-loans-amidst-crisis/

Today, its membership embraces 190 countries, with staff drawn from 150 nations. The IMF is governed by and accountable to those 190 countries that make up its near-global membership.

How We Are Organized At the top of its organizational structure is the Board of Governors. The day-to-day work of the IMF is overseen by its 24-member Executive Board, which represents the entire membership and supported by IMF staff. The Managing Director is the head of the IMF staff and Chair of the Executive Board. S/he is assisted by four Deputy Managing Directors. Learn more

How We Are Financed The IMF's resources mainly come from the money that countries pay as their capital subscription (quotas) when they become members. Each member of the IMF is assigned a quota, based broadly on its relative position in the world economy. Countries can then borrow from this pool when they fall into financial difficulty. Learn more

Lending The IMF provides loans—including emergency loans—to member countries experiencing actual or potential balance of payments problems. The aim is to help them rebuild their international reserves, stabilize their currencies, continue paying for imports, and restore conditions for strong economic growth, while correcting underlying problems.

Surveillance The IMF monitors the international monetary system and global economic developments to identify risks and recommend policies for growth and financial stability. The Fund also undertakes a regular health check of the economic and financial policies of its 190 member countries. In addition, the IMF identifies possible risks to the economic stability of its member countries and advises their governments on possible policy adjustments. Learn how the IMF helped Vietnam.

Washington, DC : The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a disbursement of US$1.4 billion (SDR 1,005.9 million) under the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) to help meet urgent financing needs and mitigate the economic impact of the war.

The Executive Board expressed its strong support for the Ukrainian people.

The war in Ukraine is resulting in tragic loss of life and human suffering. While the outlook is subject to extraordinary uncertainty, the economic consequences are already very serious, with refugee flows of over 2 million persons in just 13 days and large-scale destruction of key infrastructure in Ukraine. This disbursement under the RFI, equivalent to 50 percent of Ukraine’s quota in the IMF, will help meet urgent balance of payment needs arising from the impacts of the ongoing war and will provide critical support in the short term while playing a catalytic role for financing from other partners.

The Ukrainian authorities have canceled the Stand-by Arrangement and the authorities have expressed their intent to work with the IMF to design an appropriate economic program aimed at rehabilitation and growth, when conditions permit. The authorities intend to remain in close consultation with staff as they continue to design and implement effective crisis mitigation measures.

Following the Executive Board discussion, Ms. Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director and Chair, made the following statement:

The Russian military invasion of Ukraine has been responsible for a massive humanitarian and economic crisis. The tragic loss of life, huge refugee flows, and immense destruction of infrastructure and productive capacity is causing severe human suffering and will lead to a deep recession this year. Financing needs are large, urgent, and could rise significantly as the war continues.

The emergency policy response of the Ukrainian authorities has been remarkable. Administrative and capital controls have been introduced to preserve the availability of foreign exchange reserves and reduce uncertainty regarding the exchange rate. To further support financial stability, the National Bank of Ukraine has established a new liquidity facility and introduced regulatory forbearance measures. While cash withdrawal limits have been imposed, cashless transactions have not been limited. Fiscal policy has focused on ensuring priority payments. Ukraine has stayed current on all debt obligations.

Against this extraordinary background, the IMF has approved critical financial support. This should be instrumental in catalyzing the large-scale mobilization of additional concessional financing that will be required to help fill the financing gap and mitigate the economic impacts of the war. Once the war is over and a proper damage assessment can be performed, additional large support is likely to be needed to support reconstruction efforts.

The Fund expresses its deepest sympathy to the Ukrainian people in these extraordinarily difficult times and will remain closely engaged with the Ukrainian authorities.",https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2022/03/09/pr2269-ukraine-imf-executive-board-approves-usd-billion-in-emergency-financing-support-to-ukraine
