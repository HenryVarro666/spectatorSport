0,880e115d-8f21-495d-9559-6906a19cb8ca,['Sky Uk Limited'],,"Children have been buried under rubble after a Russian airstrike hit a hospital in Mariupol, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said.

The president tweeted that children were among people ""under the wreckage"", calling the strike an ""atrocity"".

A six-year-old child is among three people killed in the attack yesterday, the deputy mayor of Mariupol has told the BBC.

He added that 17 people were injured in the attack.

Sergei Orlov said ""The last information that we have about victims is that most of the visitors were in a bomb shelter.

""That's why we have information about 17 injured people - and that's mostly pregnant women and doctors who work in this hospital.""

Mariupol's city council said the maternity and children's hospital had been destroyed, adding that ""the destruction is colossal"".

The governor of Donetsk claimed that the airstrike happened during an agreed ceasefire period to allow civilians to safely escape.

And video footage from the hospital shows bloodied pregnant women being brought out on stretchers.

In the grounds there is a huge crater, estimated to be about 20ft deep and 30ft wide. According to former senior RAF Office Air Marshall Edward Stringer, the crater seems to be evidence of a large, general-purpose bomb of at least 1,000lbs - probably 2,000lbs.

He told Sky News this was not likely to be a cluster bomb and is more likely to have been a sophisticated missile.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has condemned the attack as ""depraved"" and said the UK is exploring ""more support” for Ukraine to defend itself, adding: ""We will hold Putin to account for his terrible crimes.""

The Ukrainian government said 1,170 civilians have been killed in Mariupol since Russia began its invasion, citing the city's deputy mayor. The city council has put the figure at 1,207 civilians.

People in the city have been forced to get water from melting snow, while some bodies lay in the street from intense bombardment.

Mariupol's mayor Vadim Boychenko said: ""I am sure that the time will come when all these occupiers will sit in the dock in The Hague. And this war crime will be punished, and the perpetrators will burn in hell.""

The city council said it has endured nine days of genocide, adding: ""We will never forgive. We will never forget. Hold on, Mariupol.""

Yesterday a six-year-old girl named Tanya died alone from dehydration in the ruins of her home in the city after her mother was killed in shelling by Russian forces, Ukrainian authorities said.

New ceasefires were announced on Wednesday morning to allow thousands of civilians to escape from towns around Kyiv as well as the southern cities of Mariupol, Enerhodar and Volnovakha, Izyum in the east and Sumy in the northeast.

Previous attempts to establish safe evacuation corridors largely failed because of what the Ukrainians said were Russian attacks.

But Russian President Vladimir Putin, in a telephone call with Germany's chancellor, accused militant Ukrainian nationalists of hampering the evacuations.",https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-children-buried-under-rubble-after-russian-airstrike-hit-hospital-in-mariupol-president-zelenskyy-says-12561747

“Direct strike of Russian troops at the maternity hospital. People, children are under the wreckage. Atrocity! How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror?,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted.

Footage shared by the country’s Ministry of Defense, and verified by the BBC and The New York Times, showed smoke rising from the destroyed building and pregnant women being taken out on stretchers. The city council wrote on Facebook that the destruction was “colossal.”

Ukrainian MP Dmitry Gurin initially told BBC anchor Yalda Hakim that there were “a lot of dead and wounded women” in the building, which holds both maternity and children’s hospitals. But Donetsk military administration chairman Pavel Kirilenko later said there were no casualties among mothers and children. He said at least 17 people were wounded, mainly medical staff, Ukrainian news outlet Hromadske reported.

It’s unclear how much of the damage to the hospital was sustained in the previous airstrikes that have hammered Mariupol for days.

In an apparent effort to maintain Moscow’s dubious claims that it is not targeting civilians in the war, a spokesperson for Russia’s Foreign Ministry claimed in a YouTube video on Wednesday that Ukrainian forces had been launching attacks from the hospital site before the bombing took place.

The hospital said last week that it had moved patients down to a basement transformed into a bomb shelter, leaving a glimmer of hope that injuries would not be catastrophic. It’s also unclear how many people were still in the facility after Russian forces cut the city’s water and power supply a week ago.

Mariupol had been under heavy attack for almost the entirety of the invasion, with Russian forces all but encircling the city, according to Britain’s Defense Ministry.

More than 1,000 deaths have been recorded in the city of 430,000 and the Associated Press’ correspondents reported earlier Wednesday that the scene was extremely grim. “Corpses lie in the streets... Hungry people break into stores in search of food and melt snow for water. Thousands huddle in basements, trembling at the sound of Russian shells pounding this strategic port city,” the outlet reported.

One city official told The New York Times he’d seen people “drink from puddles in the streets” and Deputy Mayor Sergiy Orlov described the situation as “medieval.”

Russia had initially promised to recognize a safe evacuation corridor for Mariupol’s civilians but Ukrainian officials reported that Russian attacks prevented a convoy of rescuers from reaching the city.

Ukrainian officials said on Tuesday that a six-year-old girl had died of dehydration as a result and civilians were being held “hostage.”",https://www.thedailybeast.com/russia-has-bombed-a-maternity-hospital-in-mariupol-ukraine-officials-say
2,880e115d-8f21-495d-9559-6906a19cb8ca,[],,"At least 17 people were injured in an airstrike at a paediatric and maternity hospital in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol as part of Russia's military operations.

""Today is the day that defines everything. It defines who is on which side. Russian bombs fell on a children's hospital and maternity hospital in Mariupol. As of now, 17 people are injured. Rescuers are still going through the debris,"" the Ukrainian media outlet said quoting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

""Dropping a bomb on a maternity hospital -- it's the ultimate proof that what is happening is genocide of Ukrainians. Europeans, you can't say you didn't see what is happening. You have to tighten the sanctions until can't continue their savage war,"" Zelenskyy said further.

According to United Nations data, at least 1,335 civilians have been confirmed injured or killed - 474 killed and 861 injured.

Videos posted by the regional chief and the city authorities showed the evacuation of the hospital.

Meanwhile, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has sent F-35B Lightning aircraft to Amari airbase in Estonia to provide air policing of NATO airspace.

This comes at a time when Russian aggression in continues and NATO is aiming to further strengthen and defend its eastern flank.

As the Western nations continue to work out plans to target Russia's economy, European Union on Wednesday announced new sanctions against and Belarus targeting Russian leaders, oligarchs, their family members, and the maritime sector.

President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed the hospital suffered a ""direct strike"" and children were left buried under the rubble on Wednesday afternoon, branding the attack as an act of ""genocide"".

Women waiting to give birth were wounded in the strike, while children were buried in the rubble.

A bleeding woman with a swollen belly was seen being carried on a stretcher past burned and mangled cars.

The explosion was so powerful that the ground shook more than a mile away from the blast.

Pictures show an enormous crater left by the shelling, as explosions blew out windows and destroyed much of the front of the building.

Officials were last night racing to rescue trapped survivors as temperatures plunge to minus four degrees Celsius (24.8 degrees Fahrenheit).

In a statement, the Mariupol city government said on Telegram: ""Today it is known that after the terrorist bombing of a children's hospital in Mariupol by Russian planes, 17 people were injured (children, women, doctors), three died, including one child - a girl.

""Russian troops are purposefully and ruthlessly destroying the civilian population of Mariupol,"" the statement went on.

""The whole world should know about Russia's crime against humanity, against Ukraine and against the people of Mariupol!""

Mariupol's deputy mayor Sergei Orlov said the child killed in the hospital strike is a six-year-old girl.

""The last information that we have about victims is that most of the visitors were in a bomb shelter,"" he said.

""That's why we have information about 17 injured people - and that's mostly pregnant women and doctors who work in this hospital.""

The World Health Organisation has confirmed 18 attacks on Ukrainian medical facilities since the start of the Russian invasion two weeks ago.

Orlov went on: ""We had three buildings there, maternity hospital, children's hospital and children's therapy.

""It's good most of the visitors were in bomb shelters. We have more victims of this awful crime, so we transferred all of the suffered people and injured people to other hospitals, but this hospital was destroyed by Russian bombing for the last 5 days.

""We don't know where to put our injured people. We can confirm only the numbers (dead) the day before yesterday, so we have 1,207 civilians killed in Mariupol.

""There are only bodies we can collect on the street and it's not possible to bury them in private graves out of the city, that's why we only have one possibility to bury them in mass graves and unfortunately, we cannot identify them all.""

Wednesday's airstrike was carried out during an agreed ceasefire period that was meant to allow the evacuation of civilians from the besieged southern city, said regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko.

""Europeans, you can't say you didn't see what is happening. You have to tighten the sanctions until Russia can't continue their savage war,"" Zelensky said.

""What kind of country bombs hospitals? Is afraid of hospitals? Of a maternity ward?""

The Ukraine president has repeatedly urged the US and other Nato nations to impose a no-fly zone to protect his citizens against bombing, rocket attacks and advancing Russian troops.

But Nato members warned a no-fly zone could lead to direct clashes between Russian and Nato forces.

Boris Johnson slammed the ""depraved"" airstrike in Mariupol which targeted ""vulnerable and defenceless"" mums and babies.

""There are few things more depraved than targeting the vulnerable and defenceless,"" the PM said.

""The UK is exploring more support for Ukraine to defend against airstrikes and we will hold Putin to account for his terrible crimes.""

Ukrainian MP Dmytro Gurin claimed ""many"" women had been killed or wounded in the Russian bombardment.

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the attack was “abhorrent”.

Meanwhile, British security services fear Russia could use chemical weapons as Putin “tightens the noose” on Ukraine.

Western officials fear Mad Vlad will use non-conventional weapons such as weaponised sarin, chlorine and mustard gas.

One said: “We’ve got good reason to be concerned about possible use of non-conventional weapons.

""Partly because we've seen what has happened in other theatres for example in Syria... so it's a serious concern for us.""

Days of shelling in Mariupol have cut residents off from the outside world and forced them to scavenge for food and water.

Mariupol's deputy mayor said 1,170 civilians have been killed in the city since the start of the Russian invasion.

Serhiy Orlov was quoted as saying: ""At least 1,170 people have been killed and 47 were buried in a mass grave today.

""People are without water, heat, electricity, gas, residents are melting snow to drink.""

On Tuesday, a girl, eight, died of dehydration after Russian attacks left her without access to water, power, or heating.

And a Red Cross aid mission was allegedly hit by a Russian bomb in the city, amid reports victims of shelling are being buried in mass graves.

Two bombs were dropped in the attack on the International and the Ukrainian Committees of the Red Cross, according to unverified reports.

The Red Cross described conditions inside the city as ""apocalyptic"", with residents sheltering underground from relentless bombardment.

Despite Russian and Ukrainian officials agreeing to establish ""humanitarian corridors"" to allow civilians out of some cities, Russia has been accused of shelling evacuation routes.

The Ukrainian defence ministry said Russian forces ""launched an attack right at the humanitarian corridor"" and ""did not let children, women and elderly people leave the city"".

Earlier Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Russia had broken the ceasefire around the southern port - which lies between Russian-backed separatist areas of eastern Ukraine and Crimea.

He said: ""Russia continues holding hostage over 400,000 people in Mariupol, blocks humanitarian aid and evacuation. Indiscriminate shelling continues.

""Almost 3,000 newborn babies lack medicine and food.""

Thousands of people are thought to have been killed in Ukraine - both civilians and soldiers - in two weeks of fighting since Putin's forces stormed the country.

The UN said more than two million people have now fled the country - the biggest exodus of refugees in Europe since the end of World War Two.

Authorities announced a new ceasefire yesterday to allow civilians to escape from towns around Kyiv, as well as Mariupol, Enerhodar, Volnovakha, Izyum and Sumy.

Ukraine has blamed Russia for violating ceasefire agreements, although the Russian military denies firing on civilian convoys.

US defence officials estimate that Russia has fired more than 600 missiles from inside or at Ukraine since February 24.

It comes as Russia's stranded troops are facing freezing to death in their tanks as Putin's military becomes bogged down in the mud and an unwinnable war in Ukraine.

A 40-mile long convoy of tanks and armoured vehicles remains trapped outside Kyiv - more than a week after launching their assault on the Ukrainian capital.

As a sudden cold snap sends temperatures in Eastern Europe plunging to -10C overnight - or -20C including windchill - Russian troops are trapped in what one ex-soldier called ""40-ton iron freezers"".

Icy conditions are also set to make life even harder for Putin's invaders, who have been stuck around 20 miles from Kyiv for days amid mechanical problems, fuel supply issues, and solid Ukrainian resistance.

Aerial satellite images taken on Wednesday morning show the traffic jam of Russian military vehicle close to Antonov Airport, just a few miles northwest of the outskirts of Kyiv.

Former British Army Major Kevin Price told the Mail Online that Russia's tanks will become nothing more than ""40-ton freezers"" as temperatures plummet, and said that the bitter conditions will further dampen the morale of the Russian military.

Already, reports are coming in of demoralised Russian troops complaining about the war in intercepted phone calls to comrades and loved ones.

In the calls, Putin's troops claim the war could drag on for ""months"" and say they are being ""massacred"" in Ukraine.

Russian soldiers are reportedly ""deserting their posts"" after ""large-scale losses"", including the deaths of top generals.

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said that Russian troops are having ""morale problems"".

He said: ""They are having supply problems. They are having fuel problems. They're having food problems.

""They are meeting a very stiff and determined Ukrainian resistance. And we still maintain that they are several days behind what they probably thought they were going to be in terms of their progress.""

Earlier this week, President Zelensky warned the international community would be responsible for a mass ""humanitarian catastrophe"" if it doesn't agree to a no-fly zone.

He also warned the country is at maximum threat level.

""Russia uses missiles, aircraft and helicopters against us, against civilians, against our cities, against our infrastructure. It is the humanitarian duty of the world to respond,"" he said in his daily televised address.

He also warned the country is at maximum threat level.

""Russia uses missiles, aircraft and helicopters against us, against civilians, against our cities, against our infrastructure. It is the humanitarian duty of the world to respond,"" he said in his daily televised address.

Three people, including a six-year-old girl, have been confirmed dead after Russian warplanes bombed a maternity hospital in Ukraine yesterday as pregnant women gave birth in the basement in what President Zelensky described as an 'atrocity', a 'war crime' and 'the ultimate proof of genocide against Ukrainians.'

The hospital, in the besieged city of Mariupol, was hit 'several times' by high-explosive Russian bombs - one of which missed the building by yards and left a crater two-stories deep, officials said. Other bombs scored 'direct hits', according to President Zelensky, wounding at least 17 people.

Sergei Orlov, deputy mayor of Mariupol, said he is 'absolutely sure' the Russians knew they were bombing a hospital when they launched the attack late yesterday - adding 'this is the third hospital they have destroyed' after a 300-bed Covid unit and blood bank were targeted on Tuesday.

Many of the pregnant women present at the hospital were hiding the the basement at the time of the strike on the orders of hospital authorities - a move indicative of the harsh bombardment suffered by Mariupol's citizens over the past week, and one which likely saved many lives.

Zelensky himself posted a video showing the badly damaged hospital buildings, filmed inside a destroyed ward room with its windows blown out and ceiling partially collapsed. More footage showed a car park covered in rubble and the smoldering wrecks of vehicles as injured families staggered into the freezing air while snow fell.

'Direct strike of Russian troops at the maternity hospital. People, children are under the wreckage. Atrocity! How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror? Close the sky right now! Stop the killings! You have power but you seem to be losing humanity,' the President tweeted.

He then took to Telegram, where he released a video statement from the presidential palace in Kyiv in which he said the hospital strike 'is the ultimate proof that what is happening is the genocide of Ukrainians'.

'Europeans, you can't say you didn't see what is happening. You have to tighten the sanctions until Russia can't continue their savage war,' he said.

'What kind of country bombs hospitals? Is afraid of hospitals? Of a maternity ward?

'Was someone insulting Russians? Were pregnant women shooting in direction of Rostov? Was it the ''denazification'' of a hospital? What the Russians did at Mariupol was beyond savagery.'

In a separate interview with Sky News, Zelensky added that Russian invaders want Ukrainians 'to feel like animals' by preventing them from accessing food or water, and implored NATO and the West to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine.

'They want us to feel like animals because they blocked our cities... because they don't want our people to get some food or water.

'Don't wait for me to ask you several times, a million times, to close the sky. You have to phone us, to our people who lost their children, and say ''sorry we didn't do it yesterday.''

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson meanwhile condemned the strike as 'depraved' and vowed to step up support to the beleaguered Ukrainian military.

'There are few things more depraved than targeting the vulnerable and defenceless,' the Prime Minister declared.

'The UK is exploring more support for Ukraine to defend against airstrikes and we will hold Putin to account for his terrible crimes,' he added.

Mr Johnson later on Wednesday committed to enacting the 'maximum economic cost' on Russia in wake of the bombing, while Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is expected to say aggression like Vladimir Putin's must 'never again' be allowed to 'grow unchecked' in her speech tomorrow in Washington.

Ms Truss will make comparisons between the Russian president's actions and the World Trade Centre terror attack in 2001, and will urge the international community to change its approach to dealing with antagonistic world leaders.

The White House press secretary Jen Psaki also commented: 'As a mother - I know a number of you are mothers - it is horrifying to see the barbaric use of military force to go after innocent civilians in a sovereign country.'

Mariupol's city council said the hospital had suffered 'colossal' damage but did not immediately give a figure of the wounded and dead.

The deputy head of Mr Zelensky's office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, said authorities are trying to establish the number of victims.

Ukrainian MP Dmitry Gurin told the BBC: 'There are a lot of dead and wounded women. We don't know about children or newborns yet.'

The Kremlin said on Thursday that it would ask Russian military for details about the hospital strike, saying they did not have 'clear information' about what happened.

'We will certainly ask our military about this, since we don't have clear information about what happened there. Without fail, the military will provide some kind of information,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, as Moscow's advance into Ukraine entered its third week.

Video footage from the aftermath of the attack showed that large parts of the hospital had completely collapsed, while blood soaked mattresses were pictured lying in hallways.

'Russia committed a huge crime,' said Volodymir Nikulin, a top regional police official, standing in the ruins. 'It is a war crime without any justification.'

Mariupol has been under heavy Russian bombardment for more than a week, with food, water and electricity cut off several days ago - with the Red Cross describing conditions there as 'apocalyptic'.

The head of the Ukrainian Red Cross said yesterday's strike will likely cause a complete collapse of paediatric care in Mariupol, as much of the hospital's equipment and the paediatric care wards were reduced to ashes.

Ukrainian citizens are pictured on the outskirts of Mariupol dropping bodies into a mass grave as the city's inhabitants work to remove the dead amid brutal shelling from Russian troops

Ukraine has rejected most Russian evacuation routes because they lead to Russian soil or that of its ally, Belarus, while routes that Ukraine has proposed have come under bombardment. The only successful evacuation to take place so far has been from Sumy to Poltava (in green)

Local official Pavlo Kyrylenko confirmed the fears in a post on Facebook: The maternity ward in the city centre, the children's ward and the therapy ward at the hospital - all destroyed in the Russian air raid.'

Just hours before the hospital was hit, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba warned that 3,000 babies were without food or medicines and begged for a humanitarian corridor to allow them to flee.

Moscow had promised a ceasefire in the city today so civilians could be evacuated, but failed for the fourth time to keep its word - a move Kyrylenko said 'crossed the line of humanity' before declaring Russians should 'stop calling yourselves human beings.'

Residents of Mariupol were pictured on Wednesday dumping bodies into mass graves dug on the outskirts of the city in a desperate attempt to remove the dead amid the sustained Russian bombardment.

It is not the first time that Russian airstrikes have targeted hospitals. While fighting alongside Bashar al-Assad in Syria in 2016, Putin's generals were accused of 'deliberately and systematically' blowing up hospitals as a way of weakening the city of Aleppo ahead of a ground assault.

Observers have suggested that Russia is now using a Syria-style battleplan against Ukraine after its early precision strikes failed.

The Ukrainian Healthcare Center, a think-tank based in the country, says that between the outbreak of fighting on February 24 and yesterday, their team documented 42 cases of Russian forces attacking either healthcare facilities or medics in order to deliberately provoke a 'humanitarian crisis'.

Hospitals had been struck in every theatre where Russian forces were operating, the think-tank said, including Donetsk, Luhansk, Mariupol, Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Sumy, Zhytomyr, Zaporizhzhia and Mykolaiv.

'The humanitarian catastrophe is a part of Russia's hybrid war. [It] intends to spread panic, create a flow of refugees at the borders and force the Ukrainian government to surrender,' said Pavlo Kovtonyuk, co-founder of the think-tank.

The bombing took place during what was supposed to be a ceasefire in Mariupol so that civilians could evacuate. It marks the fourth time a so-called 'humanitarian corridor' out of the city has failed because Russian forces opened fire.

The mayor of Izyum, to the east of Kharkiv, said evacuations that were supposed to be underway there yesterday also had to stop because Russians were bombing the escape route. But in Sumy, a short distance away, some civilians had managed to make it out. Successful evacuations also took place in Enerhodar, in the south, with women and children able to leave.

It is feared the evacuations are simply a precursor to Russia stepping up its bombardment of the cities to wear down dogged Ukrainian defenders before rolling in troops and tanks to capture them. CIA Director William Burns, briefing Congress on Putin's state of mind Tuesday, warned the 'angry and frustrated' despot is 'likely to double down and try to grind down the Ukrainian military with no regard for civilian casualties.'

Giving an update on the military situation yesterday afternoon, Ukrainian commanders said Russian units continue to try and surround the capital Kyiv with attacks taking place to the west and north-east of the city, with several highways blocked.

New footage released on Wednesday purported to show Russian armour just 13 miles from Kyiv as the invaders pushed through the town of Irpin.

Fighting also raged close to the city of Sumy in an attempt to surround Ukraine's second-largest city of Kharkiv, commanders said. Battles also broke out around the city of Mykolaiv in the south, as Russians attempted to push out from Kherson towards Odessa but were turned back.

Ukrainian commanders also said Russian military police had rounded up 400 activists protesting against the invasion in the occupied city of Kherson - as the long arm of Vladimir Putin's police state reached across the border to grab people on foreign soil.

Russia's defence ministry meanwhile acknowledged for the first time on Wednesday that some conscripts had been sent to fight on the frontlines in Ukraine, just days after Putin promised that only professional soldiers would be sent in.

Some associations of soldiers' mothers in Russia had raised concerns about a number of conscripts going incommunicado at the start of what Kremlin calls a 'special military operation' in Ukraine, suggesting they could have been sent to fight despite a lack of adequate training.

The revelation comes just one week after Russia's parliament passed a law imposing a prison term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally 'fake' news about the military.

'Unfortunately, we have discovered several facts of the presence of conscripts in units taking part in the special military operation in Ukraine. Practically all such soldiers have been pulled out to Russia,' the defence ministry said, promising to prevent such situations in the future.

Liz Truss described the hospital attack as 'absolutely abhorrent', but continued to reject Ukraine's request for a no-fly zone to be imposed over its skies.

Speaking in Washington, she said: 'The best way we can protect the skies is through anti-air weaponry which the UK is now going to be supplying to Ukraine.

'Of course the attack on the hospital is absolutely abhorrent, reckless and appalling.'

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said US involvement in a no-fly zone could 'prolong' the conflict, making it 'even deadlier'.

'Our goal is to end the war, not to expand it, including potentially expanding it to Nato territory,' he said.

'We want to make sure it is not prolonged, to the best of our ability. Otherwise, it is going to turn even deadlier, involve more people and I think potentially even make things harder to resolve in Ukraine itself.'

Earlier, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told the MPs that the Ministry of Defence was looking at whether they could supply anti-aircraft missiles as well as more anti-tank weapons.

Putin meets his 'children's rights commissioner' in Moscow as rockets destroy kid's hospital Vladimir Putin has met with his 'children's rights commissioner' in Moscow at the same time as shelling a maternity hospital in Mariupol in his latest vile display of hypocrisy. The Russian leader spoke with Maria Lvova-Belova at the Kremlin today after overseeing a savage two-week campaign in Ukraine which has seen children killed, orphaned or forced to flee their homes. Putin held the meeting to discuss changes to the law which will allow Russians to adopt Ukrainian orphans, after his forces killed their parents. The changes will mean children from Donetsk and Luhansk who do not have Russian citizenship will qualify for adoption. Putin said in the meeting: 'These are extraordinary circumstances and it seems to me that we need to think not about bureaucratic delays, but about the interests of children. 'I will make proposals, we will change the legislation. We will appeal to the State Duma, I am sure that the deputies will support you.' Lvova-Belova said 1,090 orphans have been evacuated to Russia from the two republics. An estimated one million children have been forced to flee Ukraine since the barbaric invasion was launched.

'We can all see the horrific devastation inflicted on civilian areas by Russian artillery and air strikes, indiscriminate and murderous,' he said.

'It is vital, therefore, that Ukraine maintains its ability to fly and to suppress Russian air attack.'

Mr Wallace said that 'in response to a Ukrainian request' the Government was exploring the donation of Starstreak high-velocity man-portable anti-air missiles.

He also confirmed that 3,615 Nlaw anti-tank weapons had been supplied - up from the previously-announced figure of 2,000 - and 'small consignments' of the Javelin system would also be sent to Ukraine.

Other Western officials expressed concern that Putin could next resort to the use of 'non-conventional weapons' such as chemical weapons, in the conflict.

One official speaking on condition of anonymity said: 'I think we've got good reason to be concerned about possible use of non-conventional weapons, partly because of what we've seen has happened in other theatres.

'As I've mentioned before, for example, what we've seen in Syria, partly because we've seen a bit of setting the scene for that in the false flag claims that are coming out, and other indications as well.'

Before the rocket attack took place, Mariupol's deputy mayor spoke about the dire situation in the besieged city - saying residents had been forced to use melted snow as drinking water, as it runs dangerously low on supplies.

Serhiy Orlov admitted that he didn't know how long the blockaded urban centre would be able to continue under siege as he spoke to CNN's John Berman about the devastating bombings on Wednesday.

Orlov said today was their fifth attempt to provide a humanitarian corridor to get supplies and transport into Mariupol, but he added that by 3pm local time, the buses had not made it anywhere near the city.

He said many residents are unable to leave as Mariupol is being bombed 'each second', after Russian forces have broken their ceasefire agreement despite agreeing to open 'humanitarian corridors' allowing citizens to flee.

'There is no ceasefire, any ceasefire in Mariupol, Mariupol is under continuous shelling from the artillery and bombing. Each hour, each minute, each second,' he added.

Mariupol, which has been under blockage for eight days, is one of the Ukrainian cities worst hit since the invasion began, with Russian forces bringing widespread destruction to residential and administrative centres.

Speaking about the devastation across the city, Orlov said Russian forces had destroyed their biggest steel planter as he warned that the situation is 'unmanageable'.

He praised the bravery of the Ukrainian army, but warned that it is the humanitarian crisis is also worsening, adding: 'We are not able to protect our lives.'

President Volodymyr Zelensky yesterday warned that the port city was running dangerously low on food, water and medicine.

Ukrainian territorial defence forces have been able to deliver vital supplies to some residents, but many more remain isolated and unable to access lifesaving rations.

Reiterating Zelensky's stark warning, Orlov said there is no more electricity, heating, gas or water supplies in Mariupol, adding that residents have had to resort to collecting wood to make fires for warmth and using melted snow as drinking water.

'It's an awful situation and I cannot imagine in my mind that it's possible in the 21st century, but it is true,' he said.

When asked how long the city might be able to continue under siege, Orlov admitted he 'didn't know' as he claimed there are at least 3,000 infants who are currently without food.

American talk show host Berman also asked the deputy mayor whether his own family are safe, after he previously spoken about being unable to reach his parents.

In response, a devastated Orlov said the district where his parents lived has been completely destroyed, saying it 'does not exist anymore', as he admitted he doesn't know if they are alive.

He added: 'The district where they live is flattened and I'm not sure that I can see them anymore. But I hope and pray they are alive.'

Ukrainian commanders said today that Russia's attack on the country has 'slowed significantly' with no major gains in any sector while its forces were bolstering defenses in key cities and 'holding the line.'

In the northern city of Chernihiv, Russian forces are placing military equipment among residential buildings and on farms, the Ukrainian general staff said. And in the south, it said Russians dressed in civilian clothes are advancing on the city of Mykolaiv. It did not provide any details of new fighting.

In Kyiv, back-to-back air alerts Wednesday morning urged residents to get to bomb shelters as quickly as possible over fears of incoming Russian missiles. Soon after an all-clear was given for the first alert, a second alert followed.

Such alerts are common, though irregular, keeping people on edge. Kyiv has been relatively quiet in recent days, though Russian artillery has pounded the outskirts.

Kyiv regional administration head Oleksiy Kuleba said the crisis for civilians was growing in the capital, with the situation particularly critical in the city's suburbs.

'Russia is artificially creating a humanitarian crisis in the Kyiv region, frustrating the evacuation of people and continuing shelling and bombing small communities,' he said.

Meanwhile, Boris Johnson continued to resist calls to drop visa requirements for Ukrainians fleeing the violence, insisting the security checks were vital to prevent President Putin infiltrating agents into the UK.

The Prime Minister said a thousand visas had been granted under the scheme allowing relatives of people in Britain to flee the war zone to join their families and he promised another programme allowing individuals to offer a home to Ukrainians would be set out in 'the next few days'.

More than 2 million people have now fled Ukraine, according to the United Nations.

'We know how unscrupulous Putin can be in his methods, it would not be right to expose this country to unnecessary security risk and we will not do it,' he said.

'We are going to be as generous as we can possibly be, but we must have checks.'

His comments in the Commons followed a call from Ukraine's ambassador to the UK to temporarily drop the visa requirement.

Vadym Prystaiko hit out at the bureaucracy of the British system, telling MPs: 'I don't want to see these pictures of people banging at the doors in Calais and scratching the doors which are quite sealed.'

It came as Russia warned the West that it is working on a broad response to sanctions that would be swift and felt in the West's most sensitive areas, after the US announced a ban on gas and oil imports - with the UK also banning Russian oil and the EU presenting a plan to wean itself off Russian gas by 2030.

'Russia's reaction will be swift, thoughtful and sensitive for those it addresses,' Dmitry Birichevsky, the director of the foreign ministry's department for economic cooperation, was quoted as saying by the RIA news agency.

Meanwhile China, which has been attempting to pacify both sides in the conflict, warned that moves by 'US-led NATO' have pushed Russia-Ukraine tensions to 'breaking point'.

As Moscow's forces have laid siege to Ukrainian cities, the fighting has thwarted attempts to create corridors to safely evacuate civilians.

One evacuation did appear successful, with Ukrainian authorities saying Tuesday that 5,000 civilians, including 1,700 foreign students, had been brought out via a safe corridor from Sumy, an embattled northeastern city of a quarter-million people.

That corridor was to reopen for 12 hours on Wednesday, with the buses that brought people southwest to the city of Poltava the day before returning to pick up more refugees, regional administration chief Dmytro Zhyvytskyy said.

Priority was being given to pregnant women, women with children, the elderly and the disabled.

In the south, Russian troops have advanced deep along Ukraine's coastline in what could establish a land bridge to Crimea, which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014.

The city of Mariupol has been surrounded by Russian soldiers for days and a humanitarian crisis is unfolding in the encircled city of 430,000.

Corpses lie in the streets of the city, which sits on the Asov Sea. Hungry people break into stores in search of food and melt snow for water. Thousands huddle in basements, trembling at the sound of Russian shells pounding this strategic port city.

'Why shouldn't I cry?' Goma Janna demanded as she wept by the light of an oil lamp below ground, surrounded by women and children. 'I want my home, I want my job. I'm so sad about people and about the city, the children.'

Tuesday brought no relief: An attempt to evacuate civilians and deliver badly needed food, water and medicine through a designated safe corridor failed, with Ukrainian officials saying Russian forces had fired on the convoy before it reached the city.

Mariupol, said Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk, is in a 'catastrophic situation.'

Natalia Mudrenko, the highest-ranking woman at Ukraine's U.N. Mission, told the Security Council that the people of Mariupol have 'been effectively taken hostage,' by the siege. Her voice shook with emotion as she described how a 6-year-old died shortly after her mother was killed by Russian shelling. 'She was alone in the last moments of her life,' she said.

Authorities in Mariupol planned to start digging mass graves for all the dead. The shelling has shattered buildings, and the city has no water, heat, working sewage systems or phone service.

Theft has become widespread for food, clothes, even furniture, with locals referring to the practice as 'getting a discount.' Some residents are reduced to scooping water from streams.

With the electricity out, many people are relying on their car radios for information, picking up news from stations broadcast from areas controlled by Russian forces or Russian-backed separatists.

Ludmila Amelkina, who was walking along an alley strewn with rubble and walls pocked by gunfire, said the destruction had been devastating.

'We don't have electricity, we don't have anything to eat, we don't have medicine. We've got nothing,' she said, looking skyward.

The deputy mayor of Mariupol cast doubt on the evacuations, telling the BBC that Russian forces continued to pound areas where people were trying to gather ahead of being taken out. He said some roads were blocked, while others were mined.

'So we cannot establish sustainable ceasefire and safety route at the moment,' Serhiy Orlov said. 'So we still have... a city in blockade.'

The city is without water, heat, working sewage systems or phone service. Residents have been getting water from streams or by melting snow.

Corpses lay in the streets and authorities planned to start digging mass graves.

With the electricity out, many people are relying on car radios for information, picking up news from stations broadcast from areas controlled by Russian forces or Russian-backed separatists.

The fighting has caused global economic turmoil, with energy prices surging worldwide and stocks plummeting. It also threatens the food supply of millions around the globe who rely on crops farmed in the Black Sea region.

Western countries have rushed weapons to Ukraine and moved to slap Vladimir Putin's Russia with sanctions.

In a further effort to punish Russia, US President Joe Biden announced a ban on Russian oil imports, and Shell announced it will stop buying oil and gas from Russia.

Ukraine's military said its forces continued defence operations in the Mariupol suburbs.

The military said 'demoralised' Russian forces were looting, commandeering civilian buildings and setting up firing positions in populated areas.

The battle for Mariupol is crucial because its capture could allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to Crimea, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014.

Late on Tuesday, Mr Zelensky released a video showing him standing near the presidential offices in Kyiv. Behind him were piles of sandbags, a snow-dusted tree and a few cars.

It was the second video in 24 hours showing him near the country's seat of power, apparently made to dispel any doubts about whether he had fled the city.

The airstrike wounded women waiting to give birth and buried children in the rubble as Russian forces intensified their siege of Ukrainian cities.

Ukrainian officials said the attack at a medical complex in Mariupol wounded at least 17 people.

The ground shook more than a mile away when the series of blasts hit. Explosions blew out windows and ripped away much of the front of one building. Police and soldiers rushed to the scene to evacuate victims, carrying a bleeding woman with a swollen belly on a stretcher past burning and mangled cars.

Another woman wailed as she clutched her child. In the courtyard, a blast crater extended at least two stories deep.

“Today Russia committed a huge crime,” said Volodymir Nikulin, a top regional police official, standing in the ruins. “It is a war crime without any justification.”

In Zhytomyr, a city of 260,000 to the west of Kyiv, bombs fell on two hospitals, one of them a children’s hospital, mayor Serhii Sukhomlyn said on Facebook. He said there were no injuries.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said the attack was a “war crime” and “final proof... that the genocide of Ukrainians is taking place.”

In an overnight video address, Mr Zelensky said: “What kind of country is this - the Russian Federation, which is afraid of hospitals and maternity hospitals and destroys them?

“Did someone in the maternity hospital abuse Russian-speakers? What was that? Was it the ‘denazification’ of the hospital?

“It is beyond atrocities already. Everything that the invaders are doing to Mariupol is beyond atrocities already.

“Today, we must be united in condemning this war crime of Russia, which reflects all the evil that the invaders brought to our land.”

Earlier, Mr Zelensky spoke of the horror of the attack as he said children were hidden underneath the wreckage after the “direct strike by Russian troops”.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson led the condemnation of the attack on social media, his words echoed by the Foreign Secretary Liz Truss.

Devastating footage posted on Twitter showed a building destroyed and emergency services on the scene.

Mariupol City Council said the destruction at the maternity hospital was “collossal”. It added: “The Russian occupying forces have dropped several bombs on the children’s hospital. The destruction is colossal.”

Mr Zelensky tweeted: “People, children are under the wreckage. Atrocity! How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror?

“Close the sky right now! Stop the killings! You have power but you seem to be losing humanity.”

In an interview with Sky News, Mr Zelensky said the Russian attackers want the Ukrainians to feel “like animals” without food or water.

He said: “They want us to feel like animals because they blocked our cities... because they don’t want our people to get some food or water.

“We can’t stop all of this alone. Only if the world will unite around Ukraine. Don’t wait for me to ask you several times, a million times, to close the sky. You have to phone us, to our people who lost their children, and say ‘sorry we didn’t do it yesterday’.”

Mariupol, in the south of Ukraine, has been bombarded by Russian attacks since Putin launched an invasion of the country on February 24.

The city has been surrounded by Russian forces for days.

Mr Johnson condemned the attack on the maternity hospital and he vowed to hold Putin to account for his “terrible crimes”.

He wrote on Twitter: “There are few things more depraved than targeting the vulnerable and defenceless. The UK is exploring more support for Ukraine to defend against airstrikes and we will hold Putin to account for his terrible crimes.”

The Foreign Secretary later said the Russian attack on a hospital is “absolutely abhorrent” during a press briefing.

The Red Cross has described conditions in Mariupol as “apocalyptic” as residents run out of essential supplies, including water and electricity.

There are multiple reports of bodies being left lying in the street uncollected.

Previous attempts to establish safe evacuation corridors in the city have largely failed due to attacks by Russian forces.

An attempt to evacuate civilians and deliver badly needed food, water and medicine failed on Tuesday as Ukrainian officials said Russian forces fired on a convoy before it reached the city.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba accused Russia on Wednesday of holding the city’s 400,000 residents hostage by shelling it despite efforts to create a safe evacuation corridor.

""Almost 3,000 newborn babies lack medicine and food,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""Russia continues holding hostage over 400,000 people in Mariupol, blocks humanitarian aid and evacuation. Indiscriminate shelling continues.""

Defence secretary Ben Wallace on Wednesday confirmed the UK had supplied Ukraine with over 3,600 javelin anti-tank missiles.

The Cabinet minister told MPs the Government would continue to provide weapons to Ukraine to bolster its defence against the Russian invasion.

Mr Wallace said that a total of 3,615 anti-tank missiles had been given to the Ukrainian army so far, with a further shipment of Starstreak portable anti-air missiles to be delivered.",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/mariupol-children-hospital-bombed-russian-army-b987044.html

Kyiv: At least 17 people were injured in an airstrike at a paediatric and maternity hospital in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol as part of Russia’s military operations.

“Today is the day that defines everything. It defines who is on which side. Russian bombs fell on a children’s hospital and maternity hospital in Mariupol. As of now, 17 people are injured. Rescuers are still going through the debris,” the Ukrainian media outlet said quoting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. “Dropping a bomb on a maternity hospital — it’s the ultimate proof that what is happening is genocide of Ukrainians. Europeans, you can’t say you didn’t see what is happening. You have to tighten the sanctions until Russia can’t continue their savage war,” Zelenskyy said further.

According to United Nations data, at least 1,335 civilians have been confirmed injured or killed – 474 killed and 861 injured.

Videos posted by the regional chief and the city authorities showed the evacuation of the hospital.

Meanwhile, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has sent F-35B Lightning aircraft to Amari airbase in Estonia to provide air policing of NATO airspace.

This comes at a time when Russian aggression in Ukraine continues and NATO is aiming to further strengthen and defend its eastern flank.

As the Western nations continue to work out plans to target Russia’s economy, European Union on Wednesday announced new sanctions against Russia and Belarus targeting Russian leaders, oligarchs, their family members, and the maritime sector.",https://newsroompost.com/world/russia-ukraine-war-air-strike-injures-17-people-at-childrens-hospital-in-mariupol/5071308.html

Ukraine also accused its northern neighbour, Belarus, of helping Russia with fuel and lubricants, and also allowing Moscow to use the country's railways and airfields.
