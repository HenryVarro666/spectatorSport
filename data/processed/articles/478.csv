Representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom – amongst others – rebuked Russia for requesting a Security Council meeting on Friday for the purpose of discussing its claims. Last week, the Security Council also held a session at Russia’s request to hear similar allegations.

US ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield likened the Russian account of biological weapons in Ukraine to internet-spurred conspiracy theories.

“President Biden has a word for this kind of talk: malarkey,” Thomas-Greenfield told the council.

“As I said, one week ago, Ukraine does not have a biological weapon programme. There are no Ukrainian biological weapons laboratories, not near Russia’s border, not anywhere.”

Russia’s envoy Vasily Nebenzya claimed that components of biological weapons were created in Ukraine, saying that there are documents that prove “direct funding and supervision of the Pentagon” to Ukrainian bio laboratories.

On Friday, Izumi Nakamitsu, the UN high representative for disarmament affairs, told the 15-member council that the United Nations is “not aware of any such biological weapons programme”. Nakamitsu made the same assertion at last week’s meeting.

US officials have previously explained that Ukraine has biological labs for public health research, and that Washington provides funding to different countries to strengthen biosafety.

For its part, China urged dialogue on Friday, while calling on “the relevant parties” to address Russia’s questions around claims of a biological weapons programme in Ukraine.

“We support the United Nations and all parties in ramping up the mediation efforts, and hope that all parties can do more things that are conducive to promoting peace talks, rather than adding fuel to the fire,” Chinese ambassador Zhang Jun told the Security Council.

The Security Council meeting coincided with a call between US President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping as Washington continues to warn Beijing against coming to Moscow’s aid in Ukraine.

After Friday’s session, UK envoy Barbara Woodward called Russia’s allegations “disinformation of the desperate”, stressing Western accounts that the Russian invasion of Ukraine is stalling amid military and logistical setbacks.

“This is a perversion of the Security Council’s purpose,” Woodward said of the Russian-requested meeting.

“The only thing this council needs to hear is that Russia’s troops are leaving Ukraine,” she had said in the council session.

Later on Friday, a joint statement by Albania, France, Ireland, Norway, the UK and the US accused Russia of subverting the United Nations’ mission.

“This meeting, and these lies, are designed for one purpose: to deflect responsibility for Russia’s war of choice and the humanitarian catastrophe it has caused,” the statement said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin launched an all-out invasion of Ukraine on February 24 after a months-long standoff that saw Moscow amass troops near the Ukrainian border as it demanded an end to NATO expansion into former Soviet republics.

The war has killed more than 800 civilians, including dozens of children, and pushed more than 3.2 million people to leave Ukraine as Russian forces continue to bombard and besiege Ukrainian towns and cities.

On Thursday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused Russia of committing “war crimes” in Ukraine, after Biden had called Putin a “war criminal” and a “pure thug”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/18/unsc-west-dismisses-russian-claims-of-bioweapons-in-ukraine

UNITED NATIONS, March 17 (Reuters) - The U.N. Security Council will no longer vote on Friday on a Russian-drafted call for aid access and civilian protection in Ukraine as Russia's U.N. envoy accused Western countries of a campaign of ""unprecedented pressure"" against the measure.

Diplomats said the Russian move would have failed with most of the 15-member council likely to abstain from a vote on the draft resolution because it did not address accountability or acknowledge Russia's invasion of its neighbor nor did it push for an end to the fighting or a withdrawal of Russian troops. read more

""Many colleagues from many delegations tell us about unprecedented pressure by Western partners, that their arms are being twisted, including blackmail and threats,"" Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said on Thursday.

Speaking at a council meeting on Ukraine's humanitarian situation, requested by Western council members, Nebenzia said: ""We do understand how difficult it is for those countries to withstand this kind of onslaught.""

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield told Reuters after the meeting: ""The only people who do arm-twisting around here are the Russians and they have to if they want to get anybody to support them.""

Nebenzia said that Russia had instead requested the council meet on Friday - when the vote had been scheduled - to discuss ""U.S. bio-laboratories in Ukraine using the new documents we obtained in the course of the special military operation.""

At a U.N. Security Council meeting on the same issue last week, also requested by Russia, Thomas Greenfield said the there are no Ukrainian biological weapons laboratories supported by the United States. The United Nations also said it had no evidence Ukraine had a biological weapons program. read more

Russia refers to its invasion of Ukraine as a ""special military operation"" targeting Ukraine's military infrastructure. Moscow denies attacking civilians.

The U.N. human rights agency has recorded 726 deaths, including 52 children, and 1,174 people injured, including 63 children, between Feb. 24 and March 15, U.N. political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo told the Security Council on Thursday. The ""actual number is likely much higher,"" she said, without specifying who was to blame.

""Most of these casualties were caused by the use in populated areas of explosive weapons with a wide impact area. Hundreds of residential buildings have been damaged or destroyed, as have hospitals and schools,"" DiCarlo said.

""The magnitude of civilian casualties and the destruction of civilian infrastructure in Ukraine cannot be denied. This demands a thorough investigation and accountability,"" she said.

The World Health Organization has verified 43 attacks on healthcare in Ukraine that have killed 12 people and injured dozens more, including health workers, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the Security Council.

""In any conflict, attacks on healthcare are a violation of international humanitarian law,"" Tedros told the council, without specifying who was to blame.

2,7173e526-a5c8-4b18-bd15-23a35d44e16c,"['Edith M. Lederer', 'The Associated Press']",2022-03-18 00:00:00,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Six Western nations accused Russia of using the U.N. Security Council to launder disinformation, spread propaganda and justify an unprovoked attack on Ukraine on Friday, and the United States again warned that Moscow’s claim the U.S. has biological warfare laboratories in Ukraine “is really a potential false flag effort in action.”

The meeting was originally intended for a vote on Russia’s draft resolution on humanitarian relief for Ukraine, which has been widely criticized for making no mention of Moscow’s invasion of its neighbor. But Russia canceled the vote Thursday and announced it would use the meeting instead to raise what it called new allegations of U.S. involvement in biological warfare activities. Those have been repeatedly denied by both the United States and Ukraine.

The six Western nations -- U.S., UK, France, Albania, Ireland and Norway -- delivered a joint statement just before the session saying: “This meeting and these lies are designed for one purpose, to deflect responsibility for Russia’s war of choice and the humanitarian catastrophe it has caused.”

They said that Russia, not Ukraine, has long maintained a biological weapons program in violation of international law and has a well-documented history of using chemical weapons.

And they accused Russia of abusing its responsibilities and privileges as a permanent member of the Security Council and subverting the council’s mandate to ensure international peace and security, calling its “horrific campaign of violence against the Ukrainian people ... deeply shameful.”

U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, who read the joint statement, later told the Security Council not to forget why they were meeting — “because Russia knew its cynical ploy to pass an exculpatory resolution had failed” and it had to cancel Friday’s vote.

The resolution would have needed at least nine “yes” votes in the 15-member council and no veto by a permanent member to be approved. Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia indicated it didn’t have the votes, accusing the West, and especially the U.S. and Albania, on Thursday of using “unprecedented pressure” on U.N. member nations to oppose the measure.

On Friday, Thomas-Greenfield reiterated what she told the council at a March 11 session called by Russia on its original bioweapons allegations: “Ukraine does not have a biological weapons program. There are no Ukrainian biological weapons laboratories -- not near Russia’s border, not anywhere.”

Ukraine only has public health facilities supported by the United States, the World Health Organization, and other governments and international institutions, she said.

Reiterating the Biden administration’s concern about a potential false flag effort, Thomas-Greenfield said, “We continue to believe it is possible that Russia may be planning to use chemical or biological agents against the Ukrainian people.”

Nebenzia responded by calling accusations that Russia intends to deploy biological and chemical weapons against Ukraine “real cynicism.”

“We’ve already warned about the fact that we know, and we officially warned ... about Ukrainian nationalists using chemical agents in some regions to carry out a provocation and then accuse Russia of having done it,” he said. “This is a false flag operation.”

Last week, Nebenzia said Russia’s Defense Ministry has documents charging that Ukraine has at least 30 biological laboratories carrying out “very dangerous biological experiments” involving pathogens, and the work “is being done and funded and supervised by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency of the United States.”

He circulated a 69-page document to council members at Friday’s meeting and claimed that the Ministry of Defense had received new details over the last week “which allow us to state that the components for biological weapons were being created on the territory of Ukraine” to implement a 2005 American-Ukrainian agreement.

“Put simply the Ukraine authorities gave the Pentagon carte blanche on the territory of Ukraine to carry out dangerous biological experiments there,” Nebenzia asserted.

Ukraine does own and operate a network of biological labs that have gotten funding and research support from the U.S. They are part of an initiative called the Biological Threat Reduction Program that aims to reduce the likelihood of deadly outbreaks, whether natural or manmade. The U.S. efforts date back to work in the 1990s to dismantle the former Soviet Union’s program for weapons of mass destruction.

“The labs are not secret,” Filippa Lentzos, a senior lecturer in science and international security at King’s College London, said in an email to The Associated Press last week. “They are not being used in relation to bioweapons. This is all disinformation.”

Britain’s U.N. Ambassador Barbara Woodward, referring to the March 11 meeting called by Russia, said Friday: “It was nonsense then, and it is nonsense now.”

U.N. disarmament chief Izumi Nakamitsu reiterated what she told the council last week: The United Nations is not aware of any such biological weapons program“ and has no mandate to investigate the Russian claims.

Russia’s Nebenzia called the material it released on March 11 and on Friday “only the tip of the iceberg.”

He said the Ministry of Defense is receiving and analyzing more new material and will continue to keep the Security Council and the international community informed “about the unlawful activity carried out by the Pentagon on Ukrainian territory.”

Russia presented its draft humanitarian resolution on Tuesday, a day after France and Mexico announced that their own humanitarian resolution on Ukraine was being moved from the Security Council, where it was certain to face a Russian veto, to the 193-member General Assembly, where there are no vetoes.

The France-Mexico draft resolution would demand “an immediate cessation of hostilities” and deplore “the dire humanitarian consequences of the hostilities against Ukraine,” provisions not in the Russian resolution.

French Ambassador Nicolas De Riviere told reporters Thursday the resolution will be presented to the General Assembly next week. Britain’s Woodward expressed hope that it would get more than the 141 votes received by a March 2 resolution demanding an immediate halt to Moscow’s offensive against Ukraine and withdrawal of all Russian troops.

The draft resolution, seen by Reuters, also does not address accountability or acknowledge Russia’s invasion of its neighbour.

Britain’s UN Ambassador Barbara Woodward described these as “glaring omissions” in a video posted on Twitter on Tuesday and said Russia was “game playing.” She said Britain would not vote for Russia’s draft text.

“Their resolution calls for parties to respect international humanitarian law, but leaves out the fact that Russia is committing war crimes,” she said. “It is their invasion and their actions driving this unfolding humanitarian crisis.”

A Security Council resolution needs at least nine votes in favour and no vetoes by Russia, China, Britain, France or the United States to be adopted. Diplomats said the Russian move would fail because most of the 15 members would likely abstain.

“We are not going to lend credence to Russia’s effort to evade accountability, responsibility and culpability for their unprovoked aggression,” said Olivia Dalton, spokesperson for the US mission to the United Nations.

Russia put forward the text after France and Mexico withdrew their own push for a council resolution on Ukraine’s humanitarian situation because they said it would have been vetoed by Moscow. They instead plan to put it to a vote in the 193-member General Assembly where no country wields a veto.

“We said from the very beginning that we would be prepared to adopt a humanitarian resolution on the situation in Ukraine, provided that this is not a disguise to blame and shame Russia again,” Russia’s UN envoy Vassily Nebenzia said on Tuesday.

The Russian-drafted Security Council resolution “demands that civilians, including humanitarian personnel and persons in vulnerable situations, including women and children are fully protected.” It also calls for safe and unhindered aid access and for the safe passage of people out of Ukraine. Ukraine and its Western allies have accused Moscow of attacking civilians indiscriminately.

Thousands of people have been killed during Russia’s invasion, which began on February 24, and several million have been displaced.Russia has called its military actions in Ukraine a “special operation”. It denies attacking civilians and says its air strikes, ground and sea offensive are intended to destroy Ukraine’s military infrastructure.

The UN Security Council will also meet on Thursday to be briefed on Ukraine, diplomats said, at the request of the United States, Albania, Britain, France, Ireland and Norway.",https://indianexpress.com/article/world/un-security-council-russia-ukraine-7823644/
4,7173e526-a5c8-4b18-bd15-23a35d44e16c,['Sky Uk Limited'],,"The Kremlin's ambassador to the United Nations has told Sky News that a theatre, reportedly full of hundreds of civilians, which was ripped apart in the besieged city of Mariupol was not bombed by Russia.

But the denial has been dismissed by UK defence minister James Heappey, who questioned how the envoy ""sleeps at night"".

Some survivors have apparently been pulled from the rubble by rescue teams following Wednesday's airstrike which Ukrainian officials said was carried out by President Vladimir Putin's forces.

Up to 1,000 men, women and children were thought to have been sheltering in the theatre's basement for safety after their homes were destroyed during the invasion.

And the word ""children"" had reportedly been displayed in large letters at the site, prior to the attack, warning warplanes about those inside.

But the Russian ambassador, Vasily Nebenzya, denied his country played any part in the incident and said there was ""an information war taking place on a larger scale than the battlefield"".

He told Sky's US correspondent Martha Kelner: ""The theatre in Mariupol was not bombed by Russia.""

Mr Nebenzya added: ""I have seen so many fakes. We have this information war which is raging on a much greater scale than on the battlefield, and I will not be surprised at anything because who wins the information war - the one who wins the war.""

But Mr Heappey told Sky News: ""I don't know how the Russian ambassador sleeps at night.

""It is clear as day what's happening in Mariupol, the Russians are indiscriminately using artillery and missile strikes to destroy a city that they were unable to take militarily.

""The resistance that remains in there is courageous.

""Mariupol is probably the worst, it's the one that we're most concerned about, but actually there's not dissimilar things happening in Kharkiv as well and other places.

Meanwhile in a joint statement, the foreign ministers of the Group of Seven leading economies have accused President Putin of conducting an ""unprovoked and shameful war"".

And they called on Russia to comply with the International Court of Justice's order to stop its attack and withdraw its forces.

Speaking at the UN Security Council, Mr Nebenzya claimed people who had left Mariupol said on 13 March that the Azov Battalion, a far-right Ukrainian militia, had been holding a ""huge number of people"" in the building and was ""preparing a bloody provocation"".

Image: Up to 1,000 civilians were believed to have been sheltering in the basement of the theatre before the attack

Theatre 'never a target', says ambassador

In his speech in New York, he acknowledged the ""children"" word outside the theatre, said Russian armed forces were ""informed of the situation"" and the building ""was never considered as a target for a strike"".

The shelter is believed to have stood firm in the bombing, and rescuers have been clearing rubble blocking the entrance to the basement.

Mariupol has suffered the worst humanitarian catastrophe of the three-week war, with hundreds of thousands of civilians trapped in basements with no food, water or power.

Mr Nebenzya said the southeastern city had previously had an ""infamous jail and torture centre"" at the airport which he compared to ""neo-Nazism"".

And he claimed ""Ukrainian radicals"" were ""clinging to the city"" and ""covering up maybe proof of their crimes… and they understand they will have to be held accountable"".

""That's why they stand ready to drag into the grave almost the entire population of Mariupol,"" he said.

Mr Nebenzya alleged the authorities in Mariupol ""use people as human shields, they do not allow them to evacuate and they place right next to residential buildings heavy weaponry in violation of humanitarian law"".

Russia accused of 'complete disinformation'

But the UK's ambassador to the UN, Barbara Woodward, has said the Security Council meetings play an important role in exposing Russian disinformation.

""What we're trying to do is isolate Russia and keep pressure on Russia to end the war,"" she told Sky News. ""We saw that with the attack on the theatre - Russia say they're attacking military targets, they're actually attacking children who are sheltering.

""This war is characterised by Russian disinformation. They said they weren't going to invade, they said they weren't going to target civilian targets. For the Russians this is a war of complete disinformation, it's hard to distinguish the truth.""

There has been an escalation in rhetoric from the US about President Putin in recent days.

US President Joe Biden called Mr Putin a war criminal and a ""murderous dictator,"" while the US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said that he personally also believes that Mr Putin is a war criminal.

""We're certainly agreeing there are war crimes being committed in Ukraine,"" Ambassador Woodward said. ""They have to be investigated by the relevant international legal authorities.

""But really the main thing we have to do now is stop the war, get Russian boots off the ground and return Ukraine to peace.""

The Kremlin has insisted Russia does not target civilians in what President Putin calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.

Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for Russia's foreign ministry, said Kyiv was trying to frame Russia for the Mariupol incident.

""The Kyiv regime immediately tried to blame the Russian military, who, in its view, allegedly dropped a bomb from the air on the theatre,"" she said.

""Of course, this is a lie. It is well known to everyone that the Russian armed forces do not bomb cities. No matter how many videos are doctored by NATO structures and how many video clips and photo fakes are pumped out, the truth will come out.""

Russia's resolution did not mention stopping its attack on Ukraine, and did not respond to the General Assembly resolution that overwhelmingly called for Russian forces to withdraw.

The U.S., U.K., France, and other nations had all spoken out against Russia's resolution, with Albania's ambassador calling it a ""mockery"" on Thursday.

Instead, Russia's Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said at an emergency United Nations Security Council meeting that Russia would have a meeting of the Council on Friday to discuss what he said was ""new evidence"" of U.S.-supported biological and chemical laboratories in Ukraine. The U.S. has flatly denied those allegations, and has warned the rhetoric could signal that Russia plans to use those types of weapons in Ukraine.

Biden's U.N. envoy, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, celebrated the decision not to vote on what she called a ""farcical humanitarian resolution which was doomed to fail."" But Thomas-Greenfield said Russia's decision to pull the vote says nothing about its commitment to ending the humanitarian crisis.

""We know if Russia really truly cared about humanitarian crises, the one that it created, it could simply stop its attacks on the people of Ukraine,"" she said. ""But instead, they want to call for another Security Council meeting to use this Council as a venue for its disinformation and for promoting its propaganda.""

Albania's Ambassador Ferit Hoxha said that during the Friday meeting, he expects ""Russia will try to make its narrative, we'll try to establish facts.""

When asked by CBS News if he thought the meeting would be a pretext for Russia using chemical weapons, Hoxha replied, ""I hope not. But that is the fear.""

The Russian ambassador's remarks came after U.N. agencies and the U.S. shared gripping accounts of what several Council members called ""war crimes"" that intentionally targeted civilians.

Thomas-Greenfield pledged that ""Russia will be held accountable for its atrocities.""

""There is only one way – one way — to end this madness,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. ""President Putin: Stop the killings. Withdraw your forces. Leave Ukraine once and for all.""

At the meeting, Thomas-Greenfield recounted reports of a mass grave in the southern port city of Mariupol, which she described as ""a narrow trench filled with the bodies of children.""

On Monday, aerial video showed the once-thriving city in ruins, with charred remains of buildings and reports of more than 2,000 civilians killed.

Thomas-Greenfield condemned Russia's weeks-long offensive, telling diplomats that ""Ukraine will never be a victory for Putin — no matter what advances he makes, no matter whom he kills or what cities he destroys.""

On Wednesday, Ukrainian officials accused Russia of striking and completely annihilating a theater in Mariupol, marked with the word ""children"" in large Russian writing, where ""hundreds"" of civilians were sheltering. There is hope that many of those in the theater's bomb shelter survived.

Russia's ambassador to the U.N. denied that Russia was responsible for the theater attack at the Thursday meeting.

China's U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun called for a re-upping of support for a diplomatic solution, but made it clear that China is opposed to the sanctions that the U.S. and Europe have placed on the Russian Federation and on Russian nationals, warning that sanctions can spark ""new humanitarian consequences.""

""Given the sluggish recovery in the global economy, ever-escalating sanctions are undermining the stability of the international industrial chain and supply chain, thus exacerbating food and energy crises, damaging people's livelihood in all countries, developing countries in particular, and triggering new humanitarian consequences,"" Zhang said.

But despite widespread hope for a diplomatic solution, U.N. officials said civilians are still being attacked and aid deliveries are being blocked.

""Daily attacks continue to batter Ukrainian cities. Many are reportedly indiscriminate, resulting in civilian casualties,"" Undersecretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo told the Council. DiCarlo said the U.N. Development agency ""projects that 90% of the Ukrainian population could be facing poverty and extreme economic vulnerability should the war continue, setting the country – and the region – back decades, and leaving deep social and economic scars.""

The Security Council also heard from World Health Organization Director General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who said that his agency ""has verified 43 attacks"" on health care facilities.

""The war in Ukraine is having devastating consequences for the health of Ukraine's people, consequences that will reverberate for years or decades to come,"" he said.

Ghebreyesus said that some desperately-needed medical supplies cannot be delivered because of the fighting. He said the organization has sent approximately 100 metric tons of supplies — including oxygen, insulin, surgical supplies, anesthetics, and blood transfusion kits — and that while the WHO has established supply lines from Lviv to many cities in Ukraine, ""challenges with access remain.""

""We have critical supplies ready for U.N. joint convoys to enter difficult areas, but so far we have not been successful,"" Ghebreyesus said. ""Today, for example, the U.N. convoy to Sumy that included a WHO truck carrying critical medical supplies was unable to enter.""

""Loads ready for Mariupol remain in staging areas and cannot proceed,"" he added.

The U.K.'s Ambassador to the U.N., Barbara Woodward, said Russian forces ""are making no distinction between military targets and women and children.""

Woodward also criticized Russia for ""cynically — almost obscenely"" proposing a resolution that calls for a ""negotiated ceasefire"" while still ""committing war crimes.""

Though other parts of the U.N. have been working in Ukraine to help citizens and refugees, the Security Council has not been able to enact any enforceable measures due to Russia's veto-wielding power.

LVIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Russian forces are blockading Ukraine’s largest cities to create a “humanitarian catastrophe” with the aim of persuading Ukrainians to cooperate with them.

He says Russians are preventing supplies from reaching surrounded cities in the center and southeast of the country.

“This is a totally deliberate tactic,” Zelenskyy said in his nighttime video address to the nation, filmed outside in Kyiv, with the presidential office in the lamplight behind him.

He said more than 9,000 people were able to leave besieged Mariupol in the past day, and in all more than 180,000 people have been able to flee to safety through humanitarian corridors.

He again appealed to Russian President Vladimir Putin to hold talks with him directly. “It’s time to meet, time to speak,” he said. “I want to be heard by everyone, especially in Moscow.”

He noted that the 200,000 people Putin gathered in and around a Moscow stadium on Friday for a flag-waving rally was about the same number of Russian troops sent into Ukraine three weeks ago.

Zelenskyy then asked his audience to picture the stadium filled with the thousands of Russians who have been killed, wounded or maimed in the fighting.

The men were the first new arrivals on the space station since the start of the Russian war in Ukraine last month.

Video of one of the cosmonauts taken as the capsule prepared to dock with the space station showed him wearing a blue flight suit. It was unclear what, if any, message the yellow uniforms they changed into were intended to send.

Oleg Artemyev was asked about the yellow flight suits when the newly arrived cosmonauts were able to talk to family back on Earth.

He said every crew chooses its own flight suits, so that they are not all the same.

“It became our turn to pick a color. But in fact, we had accumulated a lot of yellow material so we needed to use it. So that’s why we had to wear yellow,” he said.

Artemyev, Denis Matveyev and Sergey Korsakov blasted off successfully from the Russia-leased Baikonur launch facility in Kazakhstan in their Soyuz MS-21 spacecraft at 8:55 p.m. Friday (11:55 a.m. EDT). They smoothly docked at the station just over three hours later, joining two Russians, four Americans and a German on the orbiting outpost.

LVIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine lost access to the Azov Sea during Russia’s siege of the southern port city of Mariupol, the Ukrainian General Staff said late Friday.

Mariupol is the key commercial port on the Azov Sea, which is connected to the much larger Black Sea by a narrow strait.

The General Staff said the Russian forces were still trying to storm Mariupol and the fighting was ongoing. It was unclear from its statement whether the Russians have seized the city.

KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine’s interior minister said Friday that it will take years to defuse unexploded ordnances after the Russian invasion.

Speaking to The Associated Press in the besieged Ukrainian capital, Denys Monastyrsky said that the country will need Western assistance to cope with the massive task once the war is over.

“A huge number of shells and mines have been fired at Ukraine and a large part haven’t exploded, they remain under the rubble and pose a real threat,” Monastyrsky said. “It will take years, not months, to defuse them.”

In addition to the unexploded Russian ordnances, the Ukrainian troops also have planted land mines at bridges, airports and other key infrastructure to prevent Russians from using them.

“We won’t be able to remove the mines from all that territory, so I asked our international partners and colleagues from the European Union and the United States to prepare groups of experts to demine the areas of combat and facilities that came under shelling,” Monastyrsky told the AP.

He noted that another top challenge is dealing with fires caused by the relentless Russian barrages. He said there’s a desperate shortage of personnel and equipment to deal with the fires amid the constant shelling.

UNITED NATIONS — Russia’s first deputy U.N. ambassador says Twitter has blocked his account, accusing him of “abuse and harassment,” due to a tweet about the maternity hospital in the besieged southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol.

“This is very deplorable,” Dmitry Polyansky told reporters after a U.N. Security Council meeting Friday, “and this clearly illustrates how much alternative view and free press, and free information is valued by Twitter and in this country.”

Polyansky, who had more than 22,000 followers and was a prolific Twitter user, said he received a message earlier Friday from Twitter’s cloud service saying he was violating Twitter’s rules and was “engaged in abuse and harassment.”

He said Twitter referred to his warning in a tweet on March 7 “that the hospital in Mariupol had been turned into a military object by radicals. Very disturbing that UN spreads disinformation without verification.”

Associated Press journalists, who have been reporting from inside blockaded Mariupol since early in the war, documented the March 10 attack on the maternity hospital and saw the victims and damage firsthand. They shot video and photos of several bloodstained, pregnant mothers fleeing the blown-out maternity ward as medical workers shouted and children cried.

PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday asked Russian President Vladimir Putin to lift the siege of Mariupol, allow humanitarian access and order an immediate cease-fire, Macron’s office said.

Macron spoke with the Russian leader on the phone for 70 minutes. Earlier in the day, Putin had a conversation with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who also pressed for an immediate cease-fire.

Macron, who has spoken numerous times with Putin, revisited complaints over repeated attacks on civilians and Russia’s failure to respect human rights in Ukraine, the presidential Elysee Palace said.

It said that Putin, in turn, laid the blame for the war on Ukraine.

Macron, who is campaigning to renew his mandate in April elections, said during a town hall-style meeting shortly before the call that he talks to Putin because he believes there is a way toward peace, between the Ukrainian resistance, tough Western sanctions and diplomatic pressure. “We must do everything to find it,” he said.

KYIV, Ukraine — A Ukrainian officer in charge of defending the region around the country’s capital says his forces are well positioned to defend the city.

Maj. Gen. Oleksandr Pavlyuk said in an interview with The Associated Press that “the enemy is halted,” adding that “we are improving this system of defensive lines” to make Kyiv “inapproachable for the enemy.”

Despite three weeks of Russian bombardment, Ukraine has kept up a stiff defense of its cities. Fighting continued in Kyiv’s suburbs, depriving thousands of heat and clean water.

“From time to time, the enemy tests our defenses,” said Pavlyuk, a battle-hardened officer who earned his rank by leading Ukrainian troops in the conflict with Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine that erupted in 2014. “But our boys are strong in their positions and also play an active role in preventing the enemy to fulfill their plans.”

Pavlyuk, who has been put in charge of Kyiv’s defenses earlier this week, said that the Russians are using the same tactics as they used in the east to target civilian structures to try to break Ukraine’s resistance.

“That’s why now that war has been transformed into killing civilians, destroying civilian infrastructure, to frighten our people to the maximum,” he said. “But we will never give up. We will fight until the end. To the last breath and to the last bullet.”

UNITED NATIONS — Six Western nations have accused Russia of using the U.N. Security Council to launder disinformation, spread propaganda, and justify its unprovoked attack on Ukraine. And the U.S. is again warning that Moscow’s claim that the U.S. has biological warfare laboratories in Ukraine “is really a potential false flag effort in action.”

Friday’s council meeting was supposed to be for a vote on Russia’s draft resolution on humanitarian relief for Ukraine which has been widely criticized for making no mention of Moscow’s invasion of its neighbor. Russia instead raised allegations again of U.S. involvement in biological warfare activities, which have been repeatedly denied by both the United States and Ukraine.

The six Western nations — U.S., U.K., France, Albania, Ireland and Norway — delivered a joint statement just before the council session, saying: “This meeting and these lies are designed for one purpose, to deflect responsibility for Russia’s war of choice and the humanitarian catastrophe it has caused.”

They stressed that Russia has long maintained a biological weapons program in violation of international law and has a well-documented history of using chemical weapons — not Ukraine.

“There are no Ukrainian biological weapons laboratories — not near Russia’s border, not anywhere,” U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said.

Reiterating the Biden administration’s serious concern of a potential false flag effort, the U.S. envoy said, “We continue to believe it is possible that Russia may be planning to use chemical or biological agents against the Ukrainian people.”

MOSCOW — The head of the Russian delegation in talks with Ukrainian officials says the parties have come closer to an agreement on a neutral status for Ukraine.

Vladimir Medinsky, who led the Russian negotiators in several rounds of talks with Ukraine, including this week, said Friday that the sides have narrowed their differences on the issue of Ukraine dropping its bid to join NATO and adopting a neutral status.

“The issue of neutral status and no NATO membership for Ukraine is one of the key issues in talks, and that is the issue where the parties have made their positions maximally close,” Medinsky said in remarks carried by Russian news agencies.

He added that the sides are now “half-way” on issues regarding the demilitarization of Ukraine. Medinsky noted that while Kyiv insists that Russia-backed separatist regions in Ukraine’s east must be brought back into the fold, Russia believes that people of the regions must be allowed to determine their fate themselves.

Medinsky noted that a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is possible after the negotiators finalize a draft treaty to end the hostilities and it receives a preliminary approval by the countries’ governments.

Medinsky also bristled at a recent statement by Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Zelenskyy, who called for disrupting railway links to supply Russian troops in Ukraine, saying it could undermine the talks.

LVIV, Ukraine — The president of Belarus, who has allowed Russia to use his country’s territory to invade Ukraine, says he has no intention to host Russian nuclear weapons.

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has beefed up military ties with Moscow after Western sanctions over his crackdown on protests after his reelection to a sixth term in an August 2020 vote that the opposition and the West rejected as rigged. He has

Lukashenko had previously offered to host Russian nuclear weapons, but in an interview with Japanese broadcaster TBS released by his office on Friday, he said he has no such plans.

“I’m not planning to deploy nuclear weapons here, produce nuclear weapons here, create and use nuclear weapons against anyone,” he said, dismissing the allegations of such plans as an “invention by the West.”

Lukashenko said that he had made an earlier statement about a possible deployment of Russian nuclear weapons to Belarus in response to the talk in the West about a possible redeployment of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons from Germany to Poland.

The Belarusian leader noted that the constitutional amendments approved in a vote last month that shed Belarus’ neutral status has no relation to nuclear weapons.

GENEVA — The U.N. migration agency estimates that nearly 6.5 million people have now been displaced inside Ukraine, on top of the 3.2 million refugees who have already fled the country.

The estimates from the International Organization for Migration suggests Ukraine is fast on a course in just three weeks toward the levels of displacement from Syria’s devastating war – which has driven about 13 million people from their homes both in the country and abroad.

The findings come in a paper issued Friday by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. It cited the IOM figures as “a good representation of the scale of internal displacement in Ukraine — calculated to stand at 6.48 million internally displaced persons in Ukraine as of March 16.”

WASHINGTON — There have been no indications that Russia is moving troops out of Syria to bolster its forces in Ukraine, or that any more than a few Syrian fighters have been recruited to join the war, the top U.S. commander for the Middle East said Friday.

Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie told reporters that he has seen little change in Russian military activities in Syria. And he added that the U.S. military still has and uses a deconfliction phone line with the Russians in Syria, in contrast to the mixed success the U.S. has had in maintaining such contact in connection with the Ukraine war.

“We can always contact them if we have a problem. They’ll always pick up the phone, and we feel that we respond in kind to them,” said McKenzie about the Russians, whose forces in Syria support the regime of President Bashar Assad. “That relationship has been very, very professional.”

McKenzie, who is retiring after three years at the head of U.S. Central Command, said he also has seen no indication that Russia is moving any troops or assets from Syria or central Asian countries such as Tajikistan, to Ukraine. And he said he also has seen no evidence that “the temperature is rising” between Russia and the U.S. in Syria as a result of the Ukraine war.

LONDON — Britain’s defense intelligence chief says Russia is shifting to a ”strategy of attrition” after failing to reach its goals in the invasion of Ukraine.

Chief of Defense Intelligence Lt. Gen. Jim Hockenhull says Russian forces have changed their approach after failing to take major Ukrainian cities during the three-week invasion.

He said Friday that the battle of attrition “will involve the reckless and indiscriminate use of firepower. This will result in increased civilian casualties, destruction of Ukrainian infrastructure and intensify the humanitarian crisis.”

Western officials say Russian forces have enough artillery ammunition to keep up the bombardments for weeks or even longer.

Despite the fact that there have been thousands of Ukrainian civilian casualties, Russia denies targeting civilians during what it calls a special military operation in Ukraine.

ROME — For the second time this week, Italy’s financial police have carried out measures to freeze luxurious assets of Russian magnates being sanctioned by the European Union for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The latest action on Friday involved the seaside villa, valued at some 105 million euros ($116 million) and located in the Sardinian town of Portisco, belonging to Alexei Mordaschov, a steel baron, the Italian government said.

Just a few days earlier, a sprawling real estate complex on Sardinia’s coast belonging to Petr Aven, a close associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was sequestered. A yacht moored off the Italian Riviera and belonging to Mordaschov was sequestered earlier this month by Italian authorities. That vessel is valued at 27 million euros ($30 million).

ATLANTA — NASA Administrator Bill Nelson on Friday played down recent comments by the head of Russia’s space agency that the United States would have to use broomsticks to fly to space after Russia said it would stop supplying rocket engines to U.S. companies.

“That’s just Dmitry Rogozin. He spouts off every now and then. But at the end of the day, he’s worked with us,” Nelson told The Associated Press. “The other people that work in the Russian civilian space program, they’re professional. They don’t miss a beat with us, American astronauts and American mission control.”

The war has resulted in canceled spacecraft launches and broken contracts, and many worry Rogozin is putting decades of a peaceful off-planet partnership at risk, most notably at the International Space Station.

NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei is due to leave the International Space Station with two Russians aboard a Soyuz capsule for a touchdown in Kazakhstan on March 30.

NASA has said Vande Hei’s homecoming plans remain unchanged.

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden and China’s Xi Jinping spoke Friday for nearly two hours via a video call as the White House looks to deter Beijing from providing military or economic assistance for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

China’s Foreign Ministry was the first to issue a readout of the conversation, deploring “conflict and confrontation” as “not in anyone’s interest,” without assigning any blame to Russia.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying in a Twitter message called the U.S. position “overbearing.”

Ahead of the call, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden would question Xi about Beijing’s “rhetorical support” of Putin and an “absence of denunciation” of Russia’s invasion.

LVIV, Ukraine — Satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press show the Russian strike on the Lviv airport Friday destroyed the repair hangar just to the west of the north end of its runway. Firetrucks stood parked amid the rubble.

A row of fighter jets near the hangar appeared intact, though an apparent impact crater sat right in front of them. Two other buildings nearby the hangar also appear to have taken direct hits in the strike, with debris littered around them.

The early morning attack on Lviv’s edge was the closest strike yet to the center of the city, which has become a crossroads for people fleeing from other parts of Ukraine and for others entering to deliver aid or fight. The war has swelled Lviv’s population by some 200,000.

BERLIN — Switzerland is adopting the latest round of European Union sanctions against Russia targeting luxury goods and banning rating agencies from working with Russian clients.

The Swiss government said Friday that it will echo the EU’s fourth package of sanctions imposed on Russia following its attack on Ukraine.

It said that “the ban on the export of luxury goods contained in the new sanctions affects only a small portion of Switzerland’s global exports of such goods.”

However, it said that “specific companies could be seriously affected,” without naming them.

Unlike the EU and the United States, Switzerland has not yet decided whether to remove Russia from its list of “most favored” trading partners.

MARIUPOL, Ukraine — Officials say 130 people have been rescued from the ruins of a theater that served as a shelter when it was blasted by a Russian airstrike Wednesday in the besieged southern city of Mariupol.

Ludmyla Denisova, the Ukrainian parliament’s human rights commissioner, said Friday that 130 people had survived the theater bombing.

“As of now, we know that 130 people have been evacuated, but according to our data, there are still more than 1,300 people in these basements, in this bomb shelter,” Denisova told Ukrainian television. “We pray that they will all be alive, but so far there is no information about them.”

ATHENS, Greece — Greece’s prime minister is offering to rebuild the maternity hospital in Mariupol that was bombed by Russian forces last week .

Kyriakos Mitsotakis tweeted Friday that “Greece is ready to rebuild the maternity hospital in Mariupol, the center of the Greek minority in Ukraine.”

Some 100,000 people of Greek origin were living in the besieged city before the Russian invasion.

Mitsotakis called Mariupol “a city dear to our hearts and symbol of the barbarity of the war.”

Associated Press journalists documented the attack and saw the victims and damage firsthand. They shot video and photos of several bloodstained, pregnant mothers fleeing the blown-out maternity ward as medical workers shouted and children cried.

COPENHAGEN, Denmark — The Finnish government has begun posting information in Russian about the invasion of Ukraine.

“We ... want to provide Russian speakers with fact-based information from the authorities,” the Finnish government tweeted Friday.

The move comes in the face of a Russian propaganda and disinformation campaign that aims to strengthen domestic support for the invasion and undermine the resolve of Ukrainians.

The website of the Finnish government is available in Finnish and Swedish — the Nordic country’s two official languages — and in English.

President Vladimir Putin appeared at a huge patriotic rally Friday at a Moscow stadium on the eighth anniversary of the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine.

Putin, speaking to a crowd of tens of thousands of people waving Russian flags at the Luzhniki Stadium, praised the Russian military for its actions in Ukraine.

“Shoulder to shoulder, they help and support each other,” Putin said in a rare public appearance. “We have not had unity like this for a long time,” he added to cheers from the crowd.

Before Putin spoke, bands played patriotic Soviet songs about national identity and speakers praised Putin as fighting “Nazism” in Ukraine, a claim flatly rejected by leaders across the globe.

Some people, including presenters at the event, wore T-shirts or jackets with a “Z” — a symbol seen on Russian tanks and military vehicles in Ukraine and embraced by supporters of the war.

ROME — Pope Francis has denounced the “perverse abuse of power” on display in Russia’s war in Ukraine. He is calling for aid to Ukrainians who he said had been attacked in their “identity, history and tradition” and were “defending their land.”

Francis’ comments, in a message Friday to a gathering of European Catholic representatives, marked some of his strongest yet in asserting Ukraine’s right to exist as a sovereign state and to defend itself against Russia’s invasion.

It came just days after Francis told the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, that the concept of a “just war” was obsolete since wars are never justifiable and that pastors must preach peace, not politics.",https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-covid-health-business-europe-c9a22012d500295c67fd75048a05587b

Nebenzya's remarks come after six member states at the UNSC requested an open session on Russia's ""humanitarian"" decree on Thursday. Refusing to elaborate on the statements made at the said meeting, Nebenzya highlighted ""that was another exercise in anti-Russian rhetoric, which we have had the last couple of weeks."" He also called out Ukraine, accusing them of ""cynicism and hypocrisy"" over killings in Donetsk. ""Due to the extreme hypocrisy and cynicism of our partners, who are advocating for an immediate solution of the difficult, somewhat dire humanitarian situation in Ukraine, they refused to discuss our draft,"" Nebenzya said. He further defended the proposed resolution saying, ""Our draft resolution was basically just based on their draft, but it was made humanitarian instead of political.""

Russia's UNSC resolution

Russia on Tuesday circulated a draft resolution calling for the protection of civilians ""in a vulnerable situation"" in Ukraine. The said proposal included a request for safe passage and humanitarian aid for those seeking to leave the country. It also endorsed UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' call for dialogue and negotiations for a ceasefire to rapidly evacuate those stranded in war zones. Expressing grave concern at the deteriorating situation in Ukraine, the proposition underscored the need for ""all parties concerned"" to agree on diplomacy, however, failed to identify ""the parties concerned.""

The said resolution was supposed to be voted on Friday, Nebenzya had informed earlier. Although owing to the lack of mention of the aggressor in the act of war, Russia faced heavy criticism for forwarding the resolution. UK ambassador to the UN, Barbara Woodward on Tuesday took to Twitter and lambasted Russia for making ""few glaring omissions"" in the draft. ""For example, the fact that Russia is the aggressor here, and it is Russia's invasion driving the humanitarian crisis"" has not been identified, she wrote.

Emergency meet on US biolabs

Amid the escalating Russia-Ukraine war, earlier this month, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova on Wednesday accused Ukraine of conducting military bio-activities with support of the West, mainly the US. Her long-standing claims were echoed by the Russian First Deputy Permanent ambassador to the UN Dmitry Polyanskiy. The accusation has repeatedly been denied by both the US and Russia. Calling Zakharova's remarks ""preposterous"", White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki accused Moscow of waging bio-weapons to annihilate its ex-Soviet neighbour. At the last UN Security Council (UNSC) meeting held in the context, US permanent representative to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield refuted all allegations saying Russia is ""lying and spreading misinformation.""

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on Thursday has blamed NATO for the war in Ukraine.

""The war could have been avoided if NATO had heeded the warnings from amongst its own leaders and officials over the years that its eastward expansion would lead to greater, not less, instability in the region,"" Ramaphosa said.

Ramaphosa did, however, say South Africa ""cannot condone the use of force and violation of international law"", an apparent reference to the Feb 24 invasion of Ukraine.

The Russian air force didn’t target theater in Ukraine’s Mariupol - Russian UN envoy

Azov battalion

The Russian air force didn’t consider the Mariupol theater in Ukraine as a target, Russia’s UN envoy Vasily Nebenzya said at a UN Security Council meeting on Thursday.

Nebenzya said Russia’s alleged strike at a theater in Mariupol was one of the fakes that are being spread by Western countries.

""In fact, private persons as early as March 13 released information, which was obtained from Mariupol residents that had miraculously escaped from the city, that the Azov [nationalist battalion] was holding a huge number of people in that building and preparing a bloody provocation,"" he said. ""The Russian armed forces were informed about the situation, and originally the theater building wasn’t designated as a target for an air strike anyway."".

Mexico calls for UN ceasefire to allow humanitarian aid to Ukraine

Mexico raised Thursday before the United Nations (UN) Security Council that it is ""imperative"" to guarantee ""safe and unrestricted"" access for humanitarian and health personnel to provide basic services to the civilian population in Ukraine.

NATO understands Zelensky’s ‘frustration, desperation’ - Secretary-General

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Thursday he understands the ""frustration and desperation"" of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky and promised to continue arms shipment to Ukraine.

""I fully understand the frustration and the desperation that President Zelensky and the Ukrainian people feel, because they are in an extremely difficult situation,"" Stoltenberg said during the joint press conference with German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock. ""They see civilian casualties and destruction every day.""

""This is why NATO allies have stepped up their support, also delivering advanced weapon systems, air and missile defense and anti-tank weapons, fuel and ammunition,"" Stoltenberg said, underscoring that the alliance intends to continue these shipments.

He also underscored that NATO has been actively assisting in the development of the Ukrainian army since 2014, that the alliance has ""trained tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops which are now on the front line.""

Earlier in Berlin, Stoltenberg reiterated that NATO has no intention to take part in the conflict in Ukraine, emphasizing that NATO has an obligation to protect its own territory.

UN welcomes talks between Russia and Ukraine - Under-Secretary-General

Ukraine, Russia may agree on peace deal within week and half: Ukrainian presidential advisor

Ukrainian Presidential Advisor Mykhailo Podolyak said on Thursday it would take between a few days and a week and a half for Ukraine and Russia to reach a peace agreement, the Ukrainian online media outlet Liga.net reported.



Kiev wants to fix in detail a specific plan for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine in the peace deal, said Podolyak, who is also a member of the Ukrainian delegation to the peace talks with Russia.



If the agreement is inked, it would allow Ukraine and Russia to end the acute phase of the conflict, he added.



On Wednesday, Podolyak said that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky may hold talks with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in the coming days.

US Congress lower house backs legislation to strip Russia of most favored nation status

The US House of Representatives on Thursday backed legislation to remove the ‘most favored nation’ trade status for Russia and Belarus. The voting is broadcast online on the site of the lower house.

The U.S. confirms that NATO will not close Ukraine's airspace. During a visit to Slovakia on Thursday, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin once again ruled out the possibility of NATO closing airspace over Ukraine.

""If we closed the airspace, it would lead to a fight situation with Russia, and as we have said, we don't want to get to that,"" Austin acknowledged, explaining that ""there is no 'light' version of closing the airspace or a situation of 'light' war with Russia.""

""US forces are not going to fight in Ukraine and at the same time we will do everything possible to help Ukraine defend its country,"" he added, mentioning that Washington prefers to continue supporting Ukraine's defense with the delivery of armed drones and medium or short-range missiles.

Sanctions are ""unlikely"" to succeed in achieving political aims. ""The United States and the EU are very energetic in the imposition of sanctions, trade barriers, technology barriers, and financial barriers towards Russia... I do not agree with this,"" said Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University and a senior United Nations advisor.

Perceiving sanctions as Washington's widely used instrument, Sachs said, ""the rampant use of extra-territorial sanctions and secondary sanctions is unlikely to succeed in their political aims (of the U.S. government), but do cause considerable damage.""

On Wednesday, President Putin pointed out that Western sanctions “have backfired in Europe and in the United States where prices of gasoline, energy and food have shot up, and jobs in the industries associated with the Russian market have been cut.""

""Imposing sanctions is the logical continuation and the distillation of the irresponsible and short-sighted policy of the U.S. and EU countries' governments and central banks,"" he added, recalling that they have driven up global inflation in recent years and caused rising global poverty and greater inequality across the world.

Russia says British information on peace plan is ""incorrect"". Referring to an article published by the Financial Times outlet, the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov described as ""incorrect"" the information on the 15-point peace plan that Russia would negotiate with Ukraine for a ceasefire, troop withdrawals, and a Kyiv's neutral status with respect to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).

The British newspaper had reported that the negotiators of both countries on Monday discussed a draft agreement, which would imply that Ukraine renounces joining NATO and hosting foreign military bases in exchange for receiving the protection of countries such as the United States, Turkey, or the United Kingdom.

Although the Kremlin spokesman said that the Financial Times article presents some data that ""are right"", he explained that the negotiations are still developing and there is no definitive agreement yet. Adviser to the Ukrainian Presidency Mykhailo Podolyak also expressed his disagreement with the published information, arguing that the draft agreement only represents Russian demands in the negotiations.

""The Ukrainian side has its own positions,"" he said, adding that a resolution of the conflict requires a direct dialogue between presidents Volodymyr Zelensky and Vladimir Putin.

The Kremlin rejected the decision of the International Court of Justice (ICJ). On Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that his Russia cannot ""take into account"" the ICJ's decision, which ordered his country to immediately suspend its military operations in Ukraine. The Russian official explained that Russia and Ukraine must agree so that such an eventuality can be implemented.

Ukrainian President listed six priorities during peace talks. ""My priorities in the negotiations are absolutely clear: the end of the war, security guarantees, sovereignty, restoration of territorial integrity, real guarantees for our country, real protection for our country,"" Zelensky said while addressing the nation on Thursday.",https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/LIVE-A-No-Fly-Zone-Means-Conflict-with-Russia-Lloyd-Austin-20220317-0007.html

The draft resolution, seen by Reuters, also does not address accountability or acknowledge Russia's invasion of its neighbour.

British Ambassador to the United Nations Barbara Woodward described this as a ""flagrant omission"" in a video posted on Twitter on Tuesday, saying Russia was playing a game. He said Britain would not vote for the Russian text draft.

""Their resolution calls for the parties to respect international humanitarian law, but ignores the fact that Russia committed war crimes,"" he said.

""It is their invasion and actions that are driving this ongoing humanitarian crisis,"" he said.

A Security Council resolution requires at least nine votes in favor and no vetoes by Russia, China, Britain, France or the United States for adoption. Diplomats say Russia's move will fail as most of the 15 members are likely to abstain.

""We will not place any trust in Russia's efforts to evade accountability, responsibility and blame for their unwarranted aggression,"" said Olivia Dalton, spokeswoman for the US mission to the United Nations.

Russia submitted the text after France and Mexico withdrew their own push for a council resolution on Ukraine's humanitarian situation because they said it would be vetoed by Moscow.

They instead plan to put it to a vote in the 193-member General Assembly, in which no country has a veto.

""We said from the start that we would be ready to adopt a humanitarian resolution on the situation in Ukraine, provided this is not a disguise to blame and humiliate Russia again,"" Russia's envoy to the United Nations Vassily Nebenzia said.

The Russian-drafted Security Council resolution ""demands that civilians, including humanitarian personnel and persons in vulnerable situations, including women and children are fully protected."" It also calls for safe and unhindered access to aid and for the safe passage of people out of Ukraine.

Ukraine and its Western allies accuse Moscow of attacking civilians indiscriminately. Thousands of people have died during Russia's invasion, which began on February 24, while more than three million have been displaced.

It is known, Russia calls its military action in Ukraine as a special military operation. He denies attacking civilians and says the air, land and sea strikes are meant to destroy Ukraine's military infrastructure.

The UN Security Council will also meet on Thursday to be briefed on Ukraine, diplomats said, at the request of the United States, Albania, Britain, France, Ireland and Norway.
