Shear']",2022-03-16 00:00:00,"“A few minutes ago, President Zelensky reminded us that the United States is indeed the leader of the free world,” Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the minority leader, said in a speech from the Senate floor. “So it’s time we acted like it.”

Congress last week approved the nearly $14 billion aid package for Ukraine, more than doubling the Biden administration’s original price tag in an unusually swift and bipartisan display. But faced with Mr. Zelensky’s emotional descriptions of a terrorized nation, lawmakers on Wednesday emerged from his presentation showing no qualms about sending him even more aid, in what is likely to become a messy debate that splinters along party lines.

While members of Congress generally agree that the United States should send more weaponry to Ukraine, deep disagreements remain over what exactly would be appropriate to provide.

Some of Mr. Zelensky’s requests, such as the imposition of a no-fly zone, have been ruled out by the Biden administration and NATO allies. Others are being more seriously considered by Republicans and Democrats in Congress, including providing Ukraine with advanced antimissile systems and drones.

And several lawmakers in both parties continue to call for the United States to help transfer MIG fighter jets to Ukraine, despite questions about whether the country’s air force could even fly the planes and whether Russia would view the transfer as an escalatory move.

“They need more Javelins, they need more ammo, they need more Stingers, they need more surface-to-air missiles, they need more airplanes, they need more of everything,” said Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, referring to Javelin antitank missiles and Stinger antiaircraft missiles.

“Zelensky has the courage of his convictions,” Mr. Sasse added. “The question he asked the Congress and the United States government is: Will we have the courage of ours? We’re a superpower. We should act like it.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/16/us/politics/zelensky-biden-ukraine-aid.html

Sanger']",2022-03-16 00:00:00,"ODESSA, Ukraine — Ukrainian forces carried out counter-offensives against Russian positions on Wednesday, seeking to inflict what one official called “maximum losses,” even as the invading Russian military stepped up its lethal attacks on cities.

In Mariupol, an airstrike destroyed a theater where about 1,000 people had taken shelter, according to city and regional administrators, and photos and videos posted online showed the burning wreckage of the building.

Officials in Mariupol, the besieged southern city that has suffered the most intense bombardment, said they could not yet estimate the number of casualties among civilians, who might have been in a bomb shelter beneath the theater. The strike came as 11,000 residents evacuated the city on Wednesday, according to its City Council.

In a video address to Ukrainians early Thursday morning, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine called for more sanctions against Russia and said it was a “terrorist state.”

“Our hearts are broken by what Russia is doing to our people,” he said, “to our Mariupol.”

After falling back under a relentless pounding over the war’s first weeks, Ukrainian troops tried to gain some momentum with counterattacks on Russian positions outside of Kyiv and in the Russian-occupied city of Kherson, in Ukraine’s south, a senior Ukrainian military official said.

Rather than seek to regain lost territory, Ukrainian forces tried to cause as much destruction and death as possible, attacking Russian troops and equipment with tanks, fighter jets and artillery, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military information.

“In the task of inflicting maximum losses, we’ve done excellently,” the official said.

American intelligence officials said their conservative estimate of Russian troop deaths was at least 7,000, a staggering number that carries implications for both combat effectiveness and morale. Western defense and intelligence agencies estimate that Ukraine also has suffered thousands of combatants killed.

Mr. Zelensky addressed Congress via video link on Wednesday, asking for more aid, and President Biden promised more weaponry. The administration plans to provide Ukraine with high-tech defensive weapons that are easily portable and require little training or logistical support to use, according to U.S. and European officials.

Meanwhile, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia falsely accused Ukraine of seeking weapons of mass destruction and asserted that what he called an “economic blitzkrieg” by the West, aimed at destroying Russia, had failed.

Mr. Putin also sneered at Russians who oppose the war, saying the Russian people could distinguish “true patriots from the scum and the traitors, and just to spit them out like a midge that accidentally flew into their mouths.”

In a televised videoconference with top officials, he once again falsely described the government in Kyiv, led by a Jewish president and prime minister, as being “pro-Nazi” and on its way to acquiring nuclear weapons. “Their aim, of course, would have been Russia,” he said.

And then he went deeper into unreality, accusing the government in Kyiv of disregard for the suffering of the Ukrainian people that his own forces were bombing every day.

“The fact that people are dying, that hundreds of thousands, millions have become refugees, that there is a real humanitarian catastrophe in cities held by neo-Nazis and armed criminals,” he said. “They’re indifferent.”

Ukrainian and Russian negotiators held a third consecutive day of talks on a possible settlement to the conflict, and in typical fashion, the Kremlin left a muddy picture of its intentions. Mr. Putin’s bellicose, often false statements, larded with World War II references, clashed with more conciliatory comments from his underlings.

But little appeared to have changed on the battlefield. The war in Ukraine, about to enter its fourth week, has become a grinding daily slog with little evidence of significant gains for either side.

Details of the Ukrainian offensive could not be fully established independently, though several top Ukrainian officials, including key aides to Mr. Zelensky, confirmed that the counterattacks were underway.

In Kyiv, missile strikes and heavy artillery sounded overnight and in the early morning on Wednesday in exchanges in the outlying suburbs that were notably heavier and louder than in previous days. Two people were wounded and a residential building was damaged in a strike that landed near the city zoo, the second time in two days that shells have landed close to the city center.

Satellite pictures from Tuesday showed heavy black smoke above the Kherson airport, where the senior military official said Ukrainian forces had targeted parked Russian military aircraft.

Kherson was the first (and so far, only) major city to be fully taken over by Russian forces, which have turned it into a forward military base from which they have launched attacks on surrounding cities and villages, according to Ukrainian officials. On Tuesday, the Russian Defense Ministry announced that it had taken control of the entire Kherson region, giving Russian forces a significant foothold in southern Ukraine that Ukraine’s military will have difficulty dislodging.

Even so, neither side can be said to have made much progress militarily. The Institute for the Study of War, which has been tracking developments closely, noted in a Tuesday evening assessment that, for nearly two weeks, Russian forces have not been conducting extensive simultaneous attacks that would allow them to seize control of multiple areas at once in Ukraine. And they are unlikely to do so in the next week, it said.

In the absence of significant military gains, Russian forces on Wednesday continued a campaign of terror against Ukrainian civilians.

At least 10 people were killed when a Russian strike hit a bread line in Chernihiv, a city north of Kyiv that has been subject to intense shelling by Russian troops seeking to move on the capital. Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office said in a statement that the attack occurred at about 10 a.m. as people were lined up at a grocery store. Photos released by the prosecutor’s office showed several bodies scattered around a dirt yard.

Using heavy artillery, cruise missiles and fighter jets, Russian forces have systematically targeted civilian areas with no military presence, striking apartment buildings, schools and hospitals in cities and villages all over a broad front in the north, east and south of Ukraine. The attacks may have killed thousands of civilians, though reaching a precise count of the dead has been impossible.

Saying it was “profoundly concerned” by Russia’s use of force, the International Court of Justice ordered Russia on Wednesday to suspend its military operations immediately, pending its full review of a case submitted by Ukraine last month. However, the order was not expected to lead to any immediate cessation in the onslaught.

According to the United Nations, at least 726 civilians have been killed, including 64 children, since the invasion began on Feb. 24, though its figures do not include areas where fighting has been heaviest, like Kharkiv and Mariupol. In Mariupol alone, which has been turned into a hellscape of burning and decimated buildings, local authorities say at least 2,400 have been killed, and probably far more.

In Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, the municipal emergency services agency first reported on Wednesday that 500 civilians had been killed since the war began, but then revised that number to 100 later in the day. In any case, the agency said in a statement on Facebook, the true number of deaths could be much higher, noting that emergency workers were continuing to scour the rubble of residential neighborhoods for more bodies, often under fire.

Mr. Zelensky’s appeal to Congress on Wednesday was in part a desperate effort to obtain the weaponry and defenses capable of fending off such attacks. Central to this appeal was a call for a no-fly zone to be imposed over Ukraine, aimed at preventing Russian fighter jets, which cause severe destruction, from operating over Ukrainian territory. “Close the sky” has become a rallying cry for Ukrainian officials and regular citizens.

“Russia has turned the Ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people,” Mr. Zelensky said.

Knowing that the request had little chance of being approved, given that it would thrust American pilots into direct confrontation with the Russians, Mr. Zelensky quickly pivoted to something to which Republicans and Democrats have been far more receptive: asking for more weapons to enable his people to keep up the fight themselves.

Mr. Biden announced $800 million in new military aid to Ukraine, including antiaircraft and antitank missiles, body armor, vehicles, drones and small arms, bringing to $2 billion the amount delivered or pledged since early last year. But as expected, he did not offer to deliver warplanes or enforce a no-fly zone.

The United States and its allies have relied primarily on financial sanctions that are already devastating the Russian economy.

Russian officials close to the talks said Wednesday there had been signs of progress, though even there, the picture was unclear. They said the idea of a neutral Ukraine, with a status like that of Sweden or Austria, was on the table, which their Ukrainian counterparts disputed.

Sergey V. Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, told a Russian television network that the status of the Russian language and Russian news outlets in Ukraine were under discussion, and that “there are concrete formulas that are close to being agreed on.”

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Ukrainian and Russian negotiators discussed the proposed deal in full for the first time on Monday, said two of the people. The 15-point draft considered that day would involve Kyiv renouncing its ambitions to join Nato and promising not to host foreign military bases or weaponry in exchange for protection from allies such as the US, UK and Turkey, the people said.

However, the nature of western guarantees for Ukrainian security — and their acceptability to Moscow — could prove to be a big obstacle to any deal, as could the status of the country’s territories seized by Russia and its proxies in 2014. A 1994 agreement underpinning Ukrainian security failed to prevent the Kremlin’s aggression against its neighbour.

Although Moscow and Kyiv both said they had made progress on the terms of a deal, Ukrainian officials are sceptical Russia’s President Vladimir Putin is fully committed to peace and worry that Moscow could be buying time to regroup its forces and resume its offensive.

“There’s a likelihood this is trickery and illusion. They lie about everything — Crimea, the build-up of troops on the border, and the ‘hysteria’ over the invasion,” said a Ukrainian source briefed on the talks.

“We need to put pressure on them until they have no other choice” but to agree a peace deal, the person added.

Putin showed no sign of compromise on Wednesday, vowing Moscow would achieve all of its war aims in Ukraine. “We will never allow Ukraine to become a stronghold of aggressive actions against our country,” he said.

But a Russian source briefed on the talks said the proposed settlement, if agreed, could give both sides a credible way to declare victory in the war.

“Every side needs a win,” the person said. “He needs to be able to sell it to the people. Putin can say that we wanted to stop Ukraine joining Nato and putting foreign bases and missiles in its territory. If they do that, he can say, ‘I got it.’”

Israel’s Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has been the primary international mediator on the talks, three people familiar with the matter said, following a surprise visit to Moscow on March 5, with back-to-back talks with both leaders as recently as two days ago.

Recep Tayyip Erdogan, president of Turkey, also spoke by phone with Ukraine’s leader Volodymyr Zelensky as he and his top officials intensified their efforts to help broker a peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow.

Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to Zelensky, told the Financial Times that any deal would involve “the troops of the Russian Federation in any case leaving the territory of Ukraine” captured since the invasion began on February 24 — namely southern regions along the Azov and Black seas, as well as territory to the east and north of Kyiv.

Ukraine would maintain its armed forces but would be obliged to stay outside military alliances such as Nato and refrain from hosting foreign military bases on its territory.

Putin’s press secretary Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday that neutrality for Ukraine based on the status of Austria or Sweden was a possibility.

“This option is really being discussed now, and is one that can be considered neutral,” said Peskov.

Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, said that “absolutely specific wordings” were “close to being agreed” in the negotiations.

On Wednesday Ned Price, the US state department spokesperson, told reporters that Washington welcomed the expressions of hope and optimism about the diplomatic talks between Russian and Ukraine. But he said the US wanted to see “de-escalation” from Russia and there was no “tangible indication” that Putin was “changing course”.

Despite the progress in peace talks, Ukraine’s cities came under heavy shelling for a third consecutive night while Kyiv said it was launching a counter-offensive against Russian invaders.

Local officials in the besieged city of Mariupol said Russian troops bombed and destroyed a theatre, where hundreds of people had taken shelter.

Though Ukraine’s constitution commits it to seek membership of Nato, Zelensky and his aides have increasingly played down the country’s chances of joining the transatlantic military alliance, a prospect that Russia sees as a provocation.

“There is no effective system of European security now, which would be moderated by Nato. As soon as a serious war began in Europe, Nato quickly stepped aside,” Podolyak said.

“We propose a ‘Ukrainian model of security guarantees’, which implies the immediate and legally verified participation of a number of guarantor countries in the conflict on the side of Ukraine, if someone again encroaches on its territorial integrity,” he added.

Ukraine, Podolyak added, would as part of any deal “definitely retain its own army”. He also played down the significance of a ban on foreign bases in Ukraine, saying that was already precluded by Ukrainian law.

Two of the people said the putative deal also included provisions on enshrining rights for the Russian language in Ukraine, where it is widely spoken though Ukrainian is the only official language. Russia has framed its invasion as an attempt to protect Russian speakers in Ukraine from what it claims is “genocide” by “neo-Nazis”.

The biggest sticking point remains Russia’s demand that Ukraine recognise its 2014 annexation of Crimea and the independence of two separatist statelets in the eastern Donbas border region.

Ukraine has refused but was willing to compartmentalise the issue, Podolyak said.

US president Joe Biden has approved a package of new military aid for Ukraine including anti-aircraft weapons and drones in order to bolster the country’s defences against Russia’s invasion.

Biden’s move followed a gut-wrenching appeal earlier on Wednesday from Zelensky for members of Congress and Biden to help his country as it fights back against Russia’s assault.

While Biden has refused to entertain US troops on the ground, or enforcing a no-fly zone over Ukraine, he signed an $800mn security aid package on Wednesday that sharply increased the military help for Kyiv.

“We’re going to give Ukraine the army to fight and defend themselves through all the difficult days ahead,” he said.

The new package includes drones — which the president said showed America’s “commitment to send in our most cutting-edge systems to Ukraine for its defence”.

Zelensky has been on a tour of Western governing bodies. He invoked Winston Churchill in a virtual address to the UK parliament. His translator choked up with emotion when he addressed the European Union parliament. Zelensky used the Canadian prime minister’s first name, Justin, to plead for more direct help before the Canadian parliament .

As NATO member countries refuse to get directly involved in the conflict, Zelensky proposed a new international security organization and asked President Joe Biden to be the leader not only of the US, but also of the world. Watch key moments of the speech .

Under siege in Kyiv, his country invaded by Russia and in desperate need of help, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky implored American lawmakers for more — more lethal aid, a no-fly zone over his country and more sanctions on Russians.

As delivered via interpreter

Thank you very much. Madam Speaker, members of the Congress, ladies and gentlemen, Americans, friends, I’m proud to greet you from Ukraine, from our capital city of Kyiv, a city that is under missile and airstrikes from Russian troops every day. But it doesn’t give up, and we have not even thought about it for a second.

Zelensky is speaking to the US Congress from a war zone. Rather than convene in the ornate and formal House chamber, senators and congressional members are gathered in an auditorium in the Capitol complex.

Just like many other cities and communities in our beautiful country which found themselves in the worst war since World War II. I have the honor to greet you on behalf of the Ukrainian people, brave and freedom-loving people who for eight years have been resisting the Russian aggression.

Russia annexed the Ukrainian territory of Crimea in 2014 and fomented a separatist rebellion in the east of the country. Ukraine’s then-President Petro Poroshenko addressed a joint session of Congress in person and asked US lawmakers for more direct aid to stand up to Russia. The Obama administration granted security assistance but not lethal aid. The conflict simmered on, leaving some 14,000 people dead in the years leading up to Russia’s full invasion of Ukraine in February.

Those who give their best sons and daughters to stop this full-scale Russian invasion. Right now the destiny of our country is being decided. The destiny of our people, whether Ukrainians will be free, whether they will be able to preserve their democracy. Russia has attacked not just us, not just our land, not just our cities; it went on a brutal offensive against our values, basic human values. It threw tanks and planes against our freedom, against our right to live freely in our own country choosing our own future.

These words speak directly to the fundamentals of American government — life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness and the ability of people to choose their government.

Against our desire for happiness, against our national dreams, just like the same dreams you have, you Americans. Just like anyone else in the United States. I remember your national memorial in [Mount] Rushmore, the faces of your prominent presidents, those who laid the foundation of the United States of America as it is today — democracy, independence, freedom and care for everyone, for every person, for everyone who works diligently, who lives honestly, who respects the law.

We in Ukraine want the same for our people. All that is a normal part of your own life. Ladies and gentlemen, friends, Americans, in your great history, you have pages that would allow you to understand Ukrainians, understand us now when you need it right now. When we need you right now.

Here, Zelensky is essentially saying, “Help us and our democracy. Help us emulate you.”

Remember Pearl Harbor. Terrible morning of December 7, 1941, when your sky was black from the planes attacking you. Just remember it. Remember September 11th, a terrible day in 2001 when evil tried to turn your cities, independent territories in battlefields. When innocent people were attacked from air, yes. Just like nobody else expected it, you could not stop it.

December 7, a day that President Franklin D. Roosevelt said would “live in infamy” in an address to Congress. September 11, a day that led the US to ask NATO allies for help. These are also days in which the US was attacked from the sky. Today, Zelensky wants a no-fly zone over Ukraine.

Our country experienced the same every day. Right now, at this moment, every night for three weeks now, various Ukrainian cities: Odesa … [names long list of Ukrainian cities], Russia has turned the Ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people. Russian troops have already fired nearly 1,000 missiles at Ukraine, countless bombs, they use drones to kill us with precision. This is a terror that Europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for our life for an answer to this terror from the whole world.

Is this a lot to ask for, to create a no-fly zone over Ukraine to save people? Is this too much to ask? Humanitary, no-fly zone, something that Russia will not be able to terrorize our free cities.

The Biden administration has repeatedly rejected Zelensky’s calls for NATO to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine — or transfer fighter jets to Ukraine — arguing it would draw the US into an active war with Russia and is a recipe for World War III. Military experts have questioned whether a no-fly zone would stop the attacks.

If this is too much to ask, we offer an alternative. You know what kind of defense systems we need, S-300 and other similar systems. You know how much depends on the battlefield, on the ability to use aircraft, powerful, strong aviation to protect our people, our freedom, our land. Aircrafts that can help Ukraine, help Europe and you know that they exist and you have them but they are on Earth, not in Ukraine — in the Ukrainian sky. They do not defend our people.

Zelensky asks for alternative types of help — direct help that is less than a no-fly zone, including Soviet-made S-300 air defense missile systems, which could be provided by other countries. But Biden has also rejected proposals to give Ukraine US fighter jets and also to give Poland American jets so that country could offload its Soviet-era jets to Ukraine.

I have a dream, these words are known to each of you today. I can say, I have a need. I need to protect our sky. I need your decision, your help, which means exactly the same, the same you feel when you hear the words, “I have a dream.”

Zelensky has spoken to the EU parliament, the UK parliament and the Canadian parliament, each time with a tailored message. Here he invokes statements made by American civil rights hero Martin Luther King Jr., much as he did with famous statements by Churchill before the UK parliament.

Ladies and gentlemen, friends, Ukraine is grateful to the United States for its overwhelming support, for everything that your government and your people have done for us, for weapons and ammunition for training, for finances, for leadership in the free world, which helps us to pressure the aggressor economically.

The US approved $13.6 billion for Ukraine as part of a massive spending bill that was signed into law this week.

I’m grateful to President Biden for his personal involvement, for his sincere commitment to the defense of Ukraine and democracy all over the world. I am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all those who commit crimes against Ukraine, against the Ukrainian people as war criminals. However, now, it is true in the darkest time for our country, for the whole Europe, I call on you to do more. New packages of sanctions are needed, constantly, every week until the Russian military machine stops.

Zelensky has repeatedly expressed his gratitude for US and NATO support, while repeatedly calling on the West to supply more aid and apply more pressure on Russia.

Restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based. We propose that the United States sanctions all politicians in the Russian Federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against Ukraine, from state Dumas members to the last official who has lack of moral to break this state terror. All [American companies] must leave Russia from their market, leave their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood. Ladies and gentlemen, members of Congress, please take the lead if you have companies in your district who finance the Russian military machine leaving business in Russia, you should put pressure. I’m asking to make sure that the Russians do not receive a single penny that they use to destroy people in Ukraine. The destruction of our country, the destruction of Europe. All American ports should be closed for Russian goods. We’re — peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world.

The severity of sanctions by the US and the West has been nothing short of remarkable. Russia is set to default on foreign loans as soon as this week. But Zelensky wants more to be done. Sanction all Russian politicians, not just specific ones, he argues. Require US companies to leave Russian markets. By saying “peace is more important than income,” Zelensky is suggesting that some things — the defense of democracy and the international rules-based order — are more important than the damage that sanctions will do to the global economy.

We already became part of the anti-war coalition, a big anti-war coalition that unites many countries, dozens of countries, those who reacted in principle to President Putin’s decision to invade our country, but we need to move on and do more. We need to create new tools to respond quickly and stop the war, the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began on February 24th. And it would be fair if it ended in a day, that in 24 hours, that evil would be punished immediately. Today the world does not have such tools. The war of the past have prompted our predecessors to create institutions that should protect us from war, but they unfortunately don’t work. We see it, you see it, so we need new ones, new institutions, new alliances and we offer them.

If Russia were to attack a NATO member, NATO allies would be compelled to come to that country’s defense under Article 5 of the organization’s charter. But Ukraine is not a member of the alliance, and Biden and other NATO leaders have said they have no plans to send troops into the country.

We propose to create an association U-24 united for peace, a union of responsible countries that have the strength and consciousness to stop conflicts immediately, provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours, if necessary, even weapons if necessary, sanctions, humanitarian support, political support, finances, everything you need to keep the peace and quickly save the world, save lives.

This is an interesting idea — a new international agreement that sounds like an alternative to NATO, of which Ukraine is not a member, and the United Nations, where Russia has the ability to veto most things as a permanent member of the Security Council. Zelensky may also be seeking to signal less of a desire for Ukraine to join NATO, a red line for Putin.

In addition, such association, such union would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters, man-made disasters, who fell victims to humanitarian crisis or epidemic. Remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things, just to give vaccines, vaccines against Covid to save lives, to prevent new strains. The world spent months, years doing things like that much faster, to make sure there are no human losses, no victims.

The world is still very far behind in giving access to Covid-19 vaccines to developing nations. Zelensky also seems to nod to climate change here, which experts say will become the major worldwide threat.

Ladies and gentlemen, Americans, if such alliance would exist today, that is U-24, we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country. In many countries of the world, those who need peace, those who suffer inhumane destruction. I ask you to watch one video, video of what the Russian troops did in our country, in our land. We have to stop it. We must prevent it, preventably destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations.

Please watch the video.

The video is graphic and hard to watch. It shows children killed and wounded. Russian forces have increasingly targeted civilian areas, a violation of international law.

[IN ENGLISH] And in the end, to sum it up, today, today it is not enough to be the leader of the nation. Today takes to be the leader of the world. Being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace. Peace in your country doesn’t depend anymore only on you and your people. It depends on those next to you, on those who are strong. Strong doesn’t mean weak. Strong is brave and ready to fight for the life of his citizens and citizens of the world. For human rights, for freedom, for the right to live decently, and to die when your time comes. And not when it’s wanted by someone else. By your neighbor.

Zelensky switches to English here and delivers a direct plea to Biden, the US President who also aspires to be the leader of the free world. What’s happening to people in Ukraine, Zelensky says, affects every democracy.

[IN ENGLISH] Today the Ukrainian people are defending not only Ukraine, we are fighting for the values of Europe and the world, [inaudible] in the name of the future. That’s why today the American people are helping not just Ukraine, but Europe and the world, to keep the planet alive, to keep justice in history. Now I’m almost 45 years old. Today my age stopped when the heart of more than 100 children stopped beating.

I see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths. And this is my main issue as the leader of my people, great Ukrainians, and as the leader of my nation, I am addressing the President Biden, you are the leader of the nation, of your great nation. I wish you to be the leader of the world. Being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace.

This is a direct message to Biden, who has tried to make his presidency about defending democracy from autocracies, but has also refused to tempt World War III by doing more for Ukraine.

Thank you.

As Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky prepares to ask Congress for further military aid to his country, the US and its NATO allies are already sending several surface-to-air missiles systems to Ukraine to aid in its defense.

According to a senior US official, these additional systems include the Soviet-era SA-8, SA-10, SA-12 and SA-14 mobile air defense systems.

These systems have a lower altitude range than the S-300 system, which Ukraine has requested. However, they have a range higher than the Stinger shoulder-fired missiles previously supplied to Ukraine, giving them the capability to hit cruise missiles.

The systems have been sourced from NATO partner nations and are “on the way,” according to this senior US official.

If large numbers of civilians were inside in the building — shown by satellite imagery earlier in the week to have the word “children” marked in large letters on the ground in front and at the back of it — it could prove one of the worst atrocities of the 3-week-old conflict.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba posted before-and-after photos of the stately, white-columned Drama Theater in the heart of the Russian-encircled city, saying that “hundreds of innocent civilians were hiding” within its walls. Mariupol, under heavy bombardment, was already the venue for some of the war’s most harrowing reports of suffering.

Writing on Twitter, Kuleba called the theater attack a “horrendous war crime,” but he did not say whether those who had taken refuge were thought to have been inside when the building was hit or had managed to flee. Earlier, the Mariupol City Council said in a post on the messaging app Telegram that it was “still impossible to estimate the scale of this horrific and inhumane act.”

Russia’s Defense Ministry denied involvement and sought to cast blame on a right-wing Ukrainian militia, the state-run RIA news agency reported.

Earlier, an around-the-clock curfew brought the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, to a standstill and Russian forces stepped up fierce attacks on civilian areas across the country Wednesday. Casualties and damage were reported in Kyiv, Kharkiv and other Ukrainian cities.

President Biden on Wednesday echoed growing international condemnation of the wholesale leveling of civilian areas by Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces. “I think he’s a war criminal,” Biden said of the Russian leader, the first time he had publicly made such a characterization.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Biden was “speaking from his heart” about televised scenes of “barbaric actions,” but did not specify a particular incident that had prompted the president’s remark. The Kremlin called the accusation “unacceptable.”

With a spiraling humanitarian and refugee crisis arising from the fighting, Putin sought to bat aside assessments by Western military officials and analysts that his forces had become bogged down in their attempt to speedily subdue Ukraine. At a televised government meeting, he insisted that what Russia calls its “special military operation” was going successfully and according to plan.

At the same time, the U.S. and Russia engaged in their highest-level encounter since Russia invaded its neighbor on Feb. 24. Jake Sullivan, the White House national security advisor, talked by phone Wednesday with Gen. Nikolai Patrushev, head of Russia’s security council, and a spokeswoman said Sullivan warned against any Russian use of chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, meanwhile, kept up his string of appeals to allies around the world for more forceful action and more weaponry. In a video speech to the U.S. Congress, he requested additional military aid and heavier sanctions on Russia, and repeated his request for a no-fly zone over Ukraine — an appeal rejected again Wednesday by NATO’s chief.

After a meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization defense ministers in Brussels, the alliance’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said a no-fly zone would risk sparking a wider war.

“NATO should not deploy forces on the ground or in the airspace over Ukraine because we have a responsibility to ensure that this conflict, this war, doesn’t escalate beyond Ukraine,” he said.

In Kyiv, plumes of smoke rose Wednesday from a 12-story apartment building in the Shevchenkivskyi district, just a few miles northwest of the city center, after Russian shelling left at least two people injured in a predawn attack. Several floors became engulfed in flames, and the top floor was destroyed.

In the northeastern city of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest, two people were found dead and four were injured after artillery destroyed two residential buildings, Ukrainian officials said. Part of a school building was also damaged early Wednesday.

In Chernihiv, about 80 miles northeast of the capital, 10 people were shot and killed while standing in line for bread, the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv said on Twitter.

The assaults took place as a third day of negotiations was set to begin between Ukraine and Russia, the latest attempt to broker peace after the two sides failed to reach agreement during multiple rounds of previous talks.

In an early-morning video, Zelensky said that the demands of both nations were sounding “more realistic.” But he said that “time is still needed for the decisions to be in the interests of Ukraine.”

In Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov agreed that a “business-like spirit” had begun to mark the talks. He told Russian channel RBK TV that “a neutral status [for Ukraine] is being seriously discussed in connection with security guarantees,” but there was no confirmation of that from Kyiv.

It’s unclear how much an outpouring of U.S. and Western assistance will help Ukraine, which has impressed the world by fending off a bigger, more militarily advanced enemy, but also suffered hundreds of deaths and severe losses of territory, especially in the east and south. Outside Mariupol, desperately needed aid convoys have been blocked in recent days.

In Washington, a senior Defense official said that the Pentagon has “reason to believe the Russians are considering their resupply and manning options,” but added that there was “no evidence” of Russian efforts to bring in additional supplies.

While he tries to rally more international support, Zelensky has appeared to shift on the key issue of NATO membership for Ukraine, pursuit of which is enshrined in the country’s constitution. On Tuesday, he said he accepted that his nation would not join the transatlantic alliance.

“It is clear that Ukraine is not a member of NATO — we understand this,” Zelensky said in a speech to the Joint Expeditionary Force, a British-led group of 10 northern European countries committed to rapid crisis response. “For years we heard about the apparently open door but have already also heard that we will not enter there, and these are truths and must be acknowledged.”

Putin has demanded that Ukraine never join the alliance and cited Kyiv’s desire to do so as a sign of Western aggression toward Russia.

On Wednesday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he agreed with Zelensky. There’s “no way Ukraine is going to join NATO anytime soon,” Johnson said during a visit to Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates.

Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to Zelensky who is taking part in negotiations, tweeted Wednesday that “our position at the negotiations is quite specific,” saying Ukraine needed “legally verified security guarantees; cease-fire; withdrawal of Russian troops.”

He also suggested that Russians were more likely to negotiate because of Ukrainian counteroffensives. In a “PBS NewsHour” interview, Podolyak said Russia was making “adjustments” to its demands because “they see the war is not going according to their plans.”

“They were planning to move in their troops, capture as much territory as possible in three days and basically have a blitzkrieg,” he said in the interview. “They did not do that, and they will not do that. They are stuck fighting in their current positions.... Therefore, we have much confidence that we will have a cease-fire in coming days.”

In Kyiv, residents said it felt like the danger was getting closer even though Russian troops haven’t made deep inroads into the city, and routes in and out remained open.

Maria Zhartovska, a 31-year-old journalist who works for the news website Babel.ua, said she awoke “to the sounds of explosions” for the second day in a row. She lives near the Lukyanivska subway station, which is three miles from Zelensky’s office and was shut down after Russian shelling damaged it Tuesday.

“By morning, we heard the air raid sirens five times,” Zhartovska said.

As afternoon came, a series of loud explosions rumbled through the city center, where the occasional car still drove on streets devoid of pedestrians.

The city’s curfew, imposed Tuesday evening because of what Mayor Vitali Klitschko described as a “dangerous moment” in the capital, is to end Thursday.

President Joe Biden announced Wednesday that an additional $800 million in military aid will be sent to Ukraine, just hours after President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's address to the U.S. Congress, a speech Biden called ""convincing.""

Biden said the U.S. is adding to its assistance, which now totals $1 billion just this week, to help ""fend off Russia's assault.""

""America is leading this effort, together with our allies and partners, providing enormous levels of security and humanitarian assistance that we're adding to today, and we're going to do more in the days and weeks ahead,"" he said, adding the fight is ""about the right of people to determine their own future, about making sure Ukraine never will be a victory for Putin, no matter what advances he makes on the battlefield.""

Biden, speaking for just over seven minutes early Wednesday afternoon, said the war in Ukraine is “a struggle that pits the appetites of an autocrat against humankind’s desire to be free.”

On a day when he called Russian President Vladimir Putin a ""war criminal'' for the first time publicly, Biden also stressed the U.S. will not get involved militarily, but added that it will help Ukraine for as long as it takes.

""We're going to stay the course,"" he said, while warning, ""This could be a long and difficult battle.''

Earlier Wednesday, Zelenskyy gave an impassioned address to an overwhelmingly supportive Congress, pleading for more military support, a ""no-fly"" zone over his country and even tougher sanctions on Russia. Zelenskyy's presentation included a gripping video showing graphic images of the brutal human and property damage inflicted by the Russians as the invading forces continued their relentless attack.

In his virtual address — three weeks into his nation's fierce struggle to repel invading Russian troops — Zelenskyy drew parallels to horrific moments in American history to explain his country's plight and called on the U.S. to ramp up its aid to Ukraine.

""Right now, the destiny of our country is being decided, the destiny of our people,"" said Zelenskyy, who drew a standing ovation from Congress at the start of his speech from Kyiv. ""Whether Ukrainians will be free, whether they will be able to preserve their democracy.""

Latest developments:

►Ukrainian military forces have hit the airport in Kherson, which Russian troops had seized early in the war, the General Staff said late Wednesday. It said the Russians were trying to remove any surviving military equipment.

Biden calls Putin ‘a war criminal’ for the first time

For the first time in public, President Joe Biden on Wednesday called Russian President Vladimir Putin “a war criminal” for his continued assault on Ukraine, which has killed hundreds of civilians.

“I think he is a war criminal,” Biden said in response to a question from a reporter after delivering remarks at the White House on the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.

Earlier in the afternoon, Biden authorized an additional $800 million in military aid for Ukraine. He vowed that the American people will be “steadfast in our support of the people of Ukraine in the face of Putin's immoral, unethical attacks on civilian populations.”

“We are united in our abhorrence of Putin's depraved onslaught,” he said.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the president was “speaking from his heart and speaking from what you’ve seen on television, which is barbaric actions by a brutal dictator through his invasion of a foreign country.”

The State Department has said it is reviewing Russia's actions for potential war crimes, a legal process Psaki said is ongoing.

Missile strike destroys theater that served as shelter in besieged Mariupol

The fate of hundreds of Ukrainians hung in the air Wednesday as the Mariupol theater where they were sheltering was destroyed by Russian forces, Ukrainian authorities said.

There was no immediate word on deaths or injuries in what the Mariupol city council said was an airstrike on the theater. The word “children” in Russian was written in large white letters in front of and behind the theater, as shown by an image taken Monday by the Maxar space technology company, in what appeared to be an attempt to dissuade the Russians from targeting the theater.

Mariupol, a southern port city of 430,000, has been the site of some of the fiercest attacks since the invasion began Feb. 24. Local officials say missile strikes and shelling have killed more than 2,300 people, and a siege that has lasted more than two weeks has left people struggling for food, water, heat and medicine.

Local authorities said Russian forces took hundreds of people hostage at a Mariupol hospital and were using them as human shields.

In central Kyiv, a 12-story apartment building burst into flames after being hit by shrapnel. And in the northern city of Chernihiv, 10 people were killed while standing in line for bread, the Ukrainian General Prosecutor’s Office said.

Presidential adviser warns Russia not to deploy chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine

President Joe Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, warned a Russian counterpart against the use of chemical and biological weapons in Ukraine, the White House said Wednesday.

Sullivan ""warned General (Nikolay) Patrushev about the consequences and implications of any possible Russian decision to use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine,"" said a White House readout of a phone call with Nikolay Patrushev, secretary of the Russian Security Council.

Biden did not mention Russian threats of chemical and biological weapons during his remarks on U.S. assistance to Ukraine on Wednesday.

In the call, Sullivan repeated ""the United States’ firm and clear opposition to Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine,"" the readout said.

It added: ""Mr. Sullivan clearly laid out the United States’ commitment to continue imposing costs on Russia, to support the defense of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to reinforce NATO’s eastern flank, in continued full coordination with our Allies and partners.""

Russia ponders how to replenish; Odesa now in its sights

Russian commanders are deliberating how to replace troops, equipment and aircraft they’ve lost in their invasion of Ukraine, a senior Defense Department official said Wednesday.

The losses mount daily due to spirited resistance from Ukrainian forces, said the official, who discussed intelligence assessments on condition of anonymity. However, the Russians still have the majority of the combat forces they deployed for the invasion.

The Russian advance on Ukraine’s major cities, including Kyiv, remains largely stalled. In the south, Russian naval vessels have begun shelling towns around the port city of Odesa, possibly in advance of an attack by ground forces, the official said.

Meantime, the United States and its allies continue to send weapons to Ukraine on a daily basis, the official said. The latest shipment of war materiel, announced Wednesday by President Joe Biden, includes 100 drones. The official indicated the drones will be armed, saying they will “deliver a punch.”

U.S. Defense officials are working with other European countries to provide Ukraine with air defense systems. Among those systems are S-300 surface-to-air missiles launchers, according to a congressional source.

Biden: We're providing up to $1 billion in new military assistance

President Joe Biden on Wednesday emphasized the strength of the new military assistance, anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons aimed at helping Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.

Biden said the $800 million package, combined with a previous appropriation, adds up to $1 billion ""just this week."" In total, the administration has committed $2 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since Biden took office.

The new package includes:

800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems

2,000 Javelin, 1,000 light anti-armor weapons, and 6,000 AT-4 anti-armor systems

100 Tactical Unmanned Aerial Systems

100 grenade launchers, 5,000 rifles, 1,000 pistols, 400 machine guns and 400 shotguns

Over 20 million rounds of small arms ammunition and grenade launcher and mortar rounds

25,000 sets of body armor

25,000 helmets

""More will be coming,"" Biden said.

Biden: Humanitarian aid will continue to flow

President Joe Biden on Wednesday spelled out the $300 million in humanitarian assistance – “tens of thousands of tons of food, water, medicine and other basic supplies” – that the U.S. has provided both to Ukraine and the neighboring countries that have harbored their refugees. He said that aid, which is separate from the $800 million announced Wednesday in security assistance, would not stop.

“We're going to continue to mobilize humanitarian relief to support people within Ukraine and those who have been forced to flee Ukraine,” he said. “Our experts on the ground in Poland and Moldova and other neighboring countries are there to make real-time assessments of a rapidly evolving crisis to get urgently needed humanitarian supplies to the people in need when they need it.”

“And we will support Ukraine's economy with direct financial assistance as well,” Biden said, though he did not provided specifics.

Putin: The West ‘underestimates’ Russia, laments losses on battlefield

In a speech aired on Russian TV, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia’s so-called “special operation” in Ukraine is going according to plan, again declining to call it an invasion.

“The West thinks we will step back,” Putin said, according to a translation from Meduza, a Latvia-based media outlet. “The West does not understand Russia.”

Putin repeated a number of false claims about the invasion, including the conspiracy theory that Ukraine was developing “weapons of mass destruction” like nuclear and bioweapons. There is no evidence, though Russia watchers note the argument may be a reference to Putin’s continued anger over the U.S. invasion of Iraq.

Putin said that in enacting sanctions, the West is trying to “cancel” Russia and that measures targeting Russia’s Central Bank showed that foreign currency reserves can be “stolen.”

Signaling an even greater crackdown on Russian civil liberties at home, Putin called for a purge of “traitors” by “patriots,” arguing that “such a natural and necessary self-purification of the society will only strengthen our country.""

McConnell: US not doing enough, says it’s ‘depressing’ to compare Biden to Zelenskyy

After listening to Zelenskyy’s speech, Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell said President Joe Biden needs to “step up his game.”

“Were not doing enough, quickly enough to help the Ukrainians. And I think comparing Zelenskyy (to Biden) is depressing. President Biden needs to step up his game – right now – before it’s too late.”

The Kentucky Republican said he agrees with the president on one point: the U.S. shouldn’t be creating a no-fly zone over Ukraine due to concerns that it could potentially escalate a direct confrontation with Russia.

Lindsey Graham's resolution would pressure Biden on jets for Ukraine

South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham is planning to bring a resolution to the Senate floor Wednesday afternoon that would put pressure on the Biden administration to reverse course and accept Poland's proposal to provide up to 28 Soviet-built MiG-29 fighter jets to the U.S. to give to Ukraine.

Zelenskyy has asked the U.S. for more air power and Graham believes there’s enough bipartisan support to pass the nonbinding resolution calling for the administration to deliver the planes and change the trajectory of the war.

“Control of the skies is the missing link,” Graham told reporters on Capitol Hill shortly after listening to Zelenskyy's address to Congressional lawmakers. “It’s the biggest advantage the Russians have.”

NATO chief: Efforts aimed at stopping war between allies, Russia

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said his alliance’s main goal with the invasion of Ukraine is to keep it from escalating into “full-fledged war between NATO and Russia.”

Stoltenberg told CNN that he understands Zelenskyy’s desperation and pleas for help, noting that NATO has provided “significant support” to Ukraine.

“NATO's core responsibility, main responsibility is to protect 1 billion people living 30 NATO allied countries,” he said, adding that the alliance has “implemented the biggest reinforcements on collective defense since the end of the Cold War” to prevent Russian attacks from spilling over Ukraine’s borders.

Stoltenberg declined to give specifics on what military aid is being sent to Ukraine beyond describing “advanced systems also to protect them in the air, air defense systems, drones and other means to also deal with attacks that are faced within the airspace.” He said he welcomed President Joe Biden’s announcement on increased military aid from the U.S.

Russian assault continues as Zelenskyy pleads US for more help

As Zelenskyy spoke to Congress, Kyiv residents huddled in homes and shelters amid a citywide curfew while Russian troops shelled neighborhoods, homes and businesses.

In central Kyiv, shrapnel from an artillery shell slammed into a 12-story apartment building, obliterating the top floor and igniting a fire, according to a statement and images released by the Kyiv emergency agency. The neighboring building was also damaged. The agency reported two victims, without elaborating.

Russian forces also have intensified fighting in Kyiv suburbs, notably around the town of Bucha in the northwest and a highway leading west, said Oleksiy Kuleba, head of the Kyiv region.

To the south, Russian forces also continued pounding beleaguered Mariupol, a seaport city of 430,000 that has faced three weeks of siege, leaving people struggling for essentials including food, water and heat. It has also has forced the digging of mass graves.

Zelenskyy speech draws rave reviews from Congress

Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said Zelenskyy’s address to Congress differed from his past remarks in that it was “not a more desperate ask, but a more resolved ask.”

“Zelenskyy was very firm, very clear in what he needed,” Murkowski said. “And if his words were not enough, if you did not look at that video and feel that there is an obligation for not only the United States, but for countries of the world to come together in support for Ukraine, you had your eyes closed.”

Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said the U.S. needs to do more, specifically mentioned MIG-29’s, anti-aircraft and anti-missile systems and armed drones.

""There’s a powerful message that came out of that video,"" Portman said. ""For all that we’ve done, it’s not enough to protect innocent lives.""

“We need to do more and specifically we need to provide them the armaments they need at a minimum to be able to protect themselves,” he added.

Sen. Murphy questions public US debate over military support

Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., a member of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, said he doesn’t think it’s wise for Congress and the Biden administration to broadcast disagreements over the best military support for Ukraine.

“I'm open to increasing our level of military commitment to Ukraine, I just don't think it is wise policy for all of those debates to play out in public in the United States Congress,” Murphy said.

“This is a bit of a strange way to prosecute a war to have daily, open, public debates about exactly which weapons and exactly which planes we're sending,” Murphy said. “Russia is not doing that, Russia is not having a public debate about how many planes they send in Ukraine and exactly what weapons systems they send in.”

Europe's human rights group expels Russia

The Council of Europe's ministers has decided to exclude Russia as a member following its invasion of Ukraine. The council, focused on human rights and democracy, was founded after World War II and Russia joined in 1996, following the Soviet Union's collapse.

A day after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the group began to assess Russia's membership. On Tuesday, Russia informed the council it would be withdrawing and the ministers formally expelled Russia on Wednesday.

“As leaders of the Council of Europe we expressed on several occasions our firm condemnation of the Russian Federation’s aggression against Ukraine,"" the council said in a statement. ""This unjustified and unprovoked aggression led to the decision of the Committee of Ministers and the Parliamentary Assembly to initiate the procedure of expulsion.""

Ukraine terrain adds to Russian military struggles

Russia’s invading troops are struggling with Ukrainian terrain, forcing them to remain on roads where Ukrainian forces have slowed their progress, according to British Defense Ministry assessment. The Russians have been reluctant to drive off-road in Ukraine, and Ukrainians have further stalled their advance by blowing up bridges, British defense attache Mick Smeath said in a statement Wednesday morning.

Russian warplanes have failed to control Ukrainian airspace, according to the British and U.S. military, further limiting the invaders’ ability to protect its ground forces.

“The tactics of the Ukrainian Armed Forces have adeptly exploited Russia’s lack of maneuver, frustrating the Russian advance and inflicting heavy losses on the invading forces,” Smeath said in the statement.

Zelenskyy asks US companies to pull out of Russia

Saying Russia is “flooded with our blood,” Zelenskyy called on U.S. companies to abandon their operations in Russia.

As he made his address to a joint session of Congress, the Ukrainian president asked for more U.S. sanctions against the Kremlin and to establish a no-fly zone in Ukraine.

“We propose that the United States sanctions all politicians in the Russian federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against Ukraine,” Zelenskyy said.

Blinken: Russia, Ukraine peace deal must be 'irreversible'

Secretary of State Antony Blinken stressed that a diplomatic solution ending Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine will require “irreversible” moves on Moscow’s part should global backlash to the conflict end.

“We will want to make sure, (the Ukrainians) will want to make sure, that anything that’s done is in effect irreversible. That this can’t happen again,” Blinken said during an interview with NPR’s Steve Inskeep.

Blinken left the door open to lifting crippling Western sanctions on Russia’s economy should the invasion end while cautioning that the moves are already making global business and finance hesitant of investing in Russia in the long term.

“If the war ends, Ukraine’s independence, territorial integrity, sovereignty are restored then many of the tools that we’re using to get to that result — of course, that’s the purpose of them, they’re not designed to be permanent,” Blinken said.

Blinken declined to say whether the U.S. is in active communication with the Kremlin over Putin's invasion but said “there are always ways of communicating” should it be necessary.

Mom who fled Ukraine now worries about life in US: 'I don't know what to do'

Last week, single mom Olga Kovalchuk was hunkered down in a Ukraine basement with her children in a basement while bombs and missiles rained over Cherkasy, a city of 278,000 on the Dnieper River.

This week, they are in a foreign land – San Diego – where Kovalchuk has no place to live, no relatives, no job. But her kids are safe.

Like more than 3 million other Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion, the 37-year-old says she is simultaneously looking back and ahead. In Ukraine, a career as an interpreter allowed Kovalchuk to work mostly from home, looking after the children. Now, the kids will need to find schools, learn English, adapt to a new culture.

“I was very angry. I didn’t want to leave. I’m a patriot,"" she says, adding that she had to go ""to save the lives of our children. Still, sometimes I feel shame because I left."" Read more here.

International students trapped at Ukraine university finally get home

International students who had been studying at Ukraine's Sumy State University have finally returned to their home countries after being trapped in the school's six hostels for two weeks with little food and water as the war raged.

The students — from India, Nigeria, Turkey and South Africa, among other countries — eventually found their way home over the course of last week and weekend after many days of travel by bus, train and plane throughout Ukraine and across borders.

Students had turned to social media to plead for help, using the hashtag “SaveSumyStudents.” But with limited access to electricity, calling attention to their plight was also difficult.

""We never had a plan, and every method of communication was lost, I couldn't communicate with my parents,"" said Samuel Olaniyan, a fourth-year student who returned to Nigeria a few days ago. ""It was very, very scary."" Read more here.

Ukraine’s military says it hit Kherson airport LVIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian military forces have dealt a punishing blow to the airport in Kherson, which Russian troops had seized early in the war, the General Staff said late Wednesday. It said the Russians were trying to remove any surviving military equipment. Ukraine’s military said it hit the airport on Tuesday. Satellite photos taken afterward by Planet Labs PBC and analyzed by The Associated Press show helicopters and vehicles on fire at the air base. Russia seized the southern port city without a fight in the first days of the war. Control over Kherson allows Russia to restore fresh water supplies to Crimea; Ukraine cut off the water after Russia annexed the peninsula in 2014.

U.S. seeing increased Russian naval activity near Odesa, defense official says The U.S. is seeing increased Russian naval activity in the area around the Ukrainian port city of Odesa, a senior U.S. defense official said Wednesday. The naval force in the northern Black Sea around Odesa includes Russian LSTs — landing ships and surface combatant ships, the official said, adding that Russian ships have been shelling some cities outside Odesa. It’s not clear if the movements are a precursor to a larger amphibious assault, the official continued, characterizing the activity as ""a change to maritime environment."" Citizens in the city, one of the largest in Ukraine, have been girding for an assault by Russian forces, including by filling and moving over 400,000 sandbags, sometimes while breaking out in song. Odesa is home to the country's National Academic Opera and Ballet Theater, and despite the threat of a Russian attack, its orchestra performed an open-air concert on Saturday to support Zelenskyy's call for a no-fly zone over Ukraine.

New Zelenskyy video suggests kidnapped Melitopol mayor has been rescued In a video uploaded to Telegram on Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appears to speak with Ivan Fyodorov, the Melitopol mayor who was kidnapped by Russian soldiers nearly a week ago — suggesting the mayor has been released. In the video, Zelenskyy appears to congratulate Fyodorov on his rescue and reassures him that Ukraine does not leave its people behind. In what seemed to be a tongue-in-cheek exchange, the mayor then says he needs a day or two before he returns to work. In response, Zelenskyy says he cannot promise two days but encourages the mayor to rest. The video was posted by the deputy head of Zelenskyy's office. The deputy head of the president's office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, said in a separate post that the rescue was a special operation. Share this -







Biden announces $800M in new defense assistance for Ukraine, including anti-aircraft systems President Joe Biden announced Wednesday that he is authorizing $800 million in U.S. assistance to Ukraine, bringing the total of announced new security aid for the country to $1 billion just this week. ""These are direct transfers of equipment from our Department of Defense to the Ukrainian military, to help them as they fight against this invasion,"" Biden said in remarks from the White House, flanked by top officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley. Biden said the new package includes: 800 anti-aircraft systems

Additional longer-range anti-aircraft systems and their munitions

9,000 anti-armor systems, which he said are ""portable high-accuracy shoulder mounted missiles""

7,000 small arms, including machine guns, shotguns and grenade launchers

20 million rounds of ammunition, artillery and mortars for small arms

Drones ""The United States and our allies and partners are fully committed to surge the weapons of assistance to the Ukrainians, and more will be coming as we source additional stocks of equipment,"" Biden said, adding bluntly: ""Now, I want to be honest. This could be a long and difficult battle. But the American people will be steadfast in our support of the people of Ukraine in the face of Putin's immoral, unethical attacks on civilian populations."" Biden said the U.S. has provided $300 million in humanitarian assistance in the last few weeks to people in Ukraine and in neighboring countries where Ukrainians are finding refuge. This assistance has included food, medicine and basic supplies, he said. When the invasion began in late February, Biden said, the U.S. rushed $350 million in additional aid, including anti-tank weapons, transport helicopters, armed patrol boats, unmanned drones, secure communications equipment, tactical gear, other high-mobility vehicles and radar systems that help track incoming artillery. He also said the administration started sending assistance to Ukraine a year ago. ""We took the threat of Putin invading very seriously. We acted on it. We sent Ukraine more security systems last year — $650 million in weapons, including anti-air and anti-armor equipment — before the invasion, more than we had ever provided before.""

Ukrainians fleeing Russian invasion mourn what was left behind MEDYKA, Poland — Parents, spouses, children, grandchildren, sweethearts, friends, careers and homes: That’s just a short list of all that was left behind by so many fleeing war in their homeland. The immensity of what remains in Ukraine contrasts starkly with the meager possessions these sudden refugees were able to bring with them. All that they own now is crammed into shopping bags and wheeled suitcases that squeak and rattle as they cross into this small red-brick village surrounded by fields. With shock, grief and relief hanging in the bright, cold air, Alexander Federov greets the new arrivals in Poland with a broad smile and some hearty Ukrainian warmth: “Vse bude dobre” — “Everything will be fine.” About 3 million Ukrainians have fled since Russia invaded their country — the majority to neighboring Poland — in the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II. Thousands of them have crossed through Medyka. Read the full story here. Share this -







Ukraine news website hacked, used to post Zelenskyy deepfake The website of a Ukrainian news outlet was hacked Wednesday and used to push a fake video in which someone who appears to be Zelenskyy tells citizens to surrender to Russia, one of the most high-profile uses of ""deepfake"" technology to date. The live TV broadcast from the media outlet, Ukraine 24, also showed a chyron that repeated what the fake Zelenskyy video said. Disinformation experts have long warned that deepfakes, computer-generated videos of a real person saying or doing things they didn't actually say or do, could be used for malicious political purposes, and Ukrainian government officials have warned for weeks that Russia may try to convince people of false news of surrender. The simulation was of low quality, with the fake Zelenskyy's mouth moving unnaturally, his head appearing somewhat detached from his body. Last week, Ukraine provincial government websites were hacked to make similar claims, leading national government officials to rush to debunk it. Channel 24's website was down as of midday Wednesday, but its Telegram channel warned about the hack and said that the message of surrender was fake. Share this -

In essence, they were creating biological weapons in close proximity to Russian borders."" He also accused Ukraine of planning to attack Donbas and Crimea in an ""ethnic cleansing."" Putin suggested he was forced to authorize the invasion because Russia was ""left with no choice for peaceful resolution of problems that we are not to blame for.""

Biden to commit new military aid to Ukraine following Zelenskyy speech Biden is expected to detail an additional $800 million in military support Wednesday after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pleaded with Congress to do more to help Ukraine defend itself against the military onslaught from Russia. Biden is expected to outline in more detail the types of security assistance the U.S. is providing, including anti-armor and air defense systems, a White House official said ahead of the remarks.

Spam campaigns look to capitalize on Ukraine donations Online scammers are trying to capitalize on the Ukraine crisis by sending a massive amount of email spam, researchers say. Many appear to try to take advantage of the fact that the Ukrainian government has taken the novel and successful step of soliciting cryptocurrency donations from the public. That's led to scammers flooding email addresses with their own crypto addresses, falsely claiming to be the Ukrainian government or working for Ukrainian refugees, according to Andrew Brandt, principal researcher at the cybersecurity company Sophos. Despite the dramatic spike in such emails, they may not be working. None of the scammers' cryptocurrency addresses that Sophos has monitored have received any funds, Brandt said. Share this -

War could contribute to biggest oil supply crisis in decades, International Energy Agency warns The International Energy Agency has cut its 2022 forecast for global oil demand amid the disruption to Russian oil production which threatens a “global oil supply shock.” “The implications of a potential loss of Russian oil exports to global markets cannot be understated,” it said in a monthly report released Wednesday. “Faced with what could turn into the biggest supply crisis in decades, global energy markets are at a crossroads,” it said. As the world’s largest oil exporter, Russia continues to send oil due to deals made before the invasion, but new business has “all but dried up,” it said. According to the report, after the exports are shunned, only the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia hold the spare capacity to offset the Russian shortfall. “Indeed, today’s alignment of energy security and economic factors could well accelerate the transition away from oil,” the agency said.
