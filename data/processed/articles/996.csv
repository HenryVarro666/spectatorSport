According to the official, the troops that have left the area around Kyiv are ""heading north,"" and ""consolidating in Belarus.""

""What we continue to believe is that they're going to be refit, resupplied, perhaps maybe even reinforced with additional manpower, and then sent back into Ukraine to continue fighting elsewhere,"" he added.

The US ""assessment"" is that these troops will be ""applied in the eastern party of the country, in the Donbas region,"" to fight there, the official said.

""Our best assessment, and it is only an assessment, is that they will be applied in the eastern part of the country in the Donbas region, but that is an assessment only,"" the official said.

A ""bitter fight"" continues over Mariupol, but ""there are no indications that the Russians have made any progress"" in taking the city, the official said.

He also assessed the situation around Kherson. ""We assess that in the Kherson area, as we've been talking about for the last few days, the Russians have kind of gotten pinched between Kherson and Mykolaiv. We now assess that they've shifted much more to a defensive posture around Kherson,"" he added.

(Metin Aktas/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)

Ukrainian officials showed international media the removal of five bodies from a basement in Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv recently retaken by Ukrainian forces.

A CNN team visited the basement and saw the bodies before removal. They were in advanced stage of decomposition.

Five men had been tortured and executed by Russian soldiers, an adviser to the Ukrainian interior minister, Anton Gerashchenko, told CNN on the ground. CNN cannot independently verify Gerashchenko’s claims.

The men were found in an area held by the Russian military until a few days ago. Several foxholes, trenches and positions for armored vehicles were still visible around the site, as were leftover Russian rations. Several ""V"" letters — informal symbols for the Russian military campaign — were also painted at the entrance to the territory.

The dead men had their hands tied behind their back and most of them had several gunshot wounds, not just to the head, but also to the lower limbs. There were several cartridge casings on the floor next to the bodies.

Volunteers removed the bodies and placed them in body bags, which were later taken away.

A volunteer told CNN they have been recovering bodies in large numbers, saying, “it’s in the hundreds, not dozens.” The volunteer and his unit showed CNN the body bags of at least 30 people who had been recovered on Sunday, plus an additional nine on Monday, including the five found in the basement.

That unit is one of several operating in the outskirts of Kyiv.",https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-04-04-22/h_6ae41ea2a3cd3ef832b8c009a8c51793

With evidence mounting of atrocities in the Kyiv suburbs, and Russian forces preparing for a new offensive farther east, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine delivered a scathing speech to the United Nations on Tuesday, accusing Russia of a litany of horrors and questioning whether a world body that takes no action to stop a war serves any purpose.

Speaking via video link to the U.N. Security Council, he compared Russian forces to the Islamic State, called for a Nuremberg-like war crimes tribunal and vented his bitter frustration, knowing that the council — where Russia is one of five permanent members with veto power — would do nothing but talk.

“Where is the security that the Security Council needs to guarantee?” Mr. Zelensky said, raising the question of whether Russia deserved to keep its seat on the council. “Are you ready to close the U.N.? Do you think that the time of international law is gone? If your answer is no, then you need to act immediately.”

The chamber fell silent as a short video provided by Mr. Zelensky’s government played, showing some of the hundreds of corpses found strewn around the city of Bucha, northwest of Kyiv, after Russian forces retreated last week — bloated, charred bodies of civilians, including children. Some victims, their hands bound, had been shot in the head.

Mr. Zelensky said that in Bucha, “they killed entire families, adults and children, and they tried to burn the bodies.” Civilians “were crushed by tanks while sitting in their cars in the middle of the road,” he added, asserting that “women were raped and killed in front of their children; their tongues were pulled out.”

China refrained from criticizing Russia in Tuesday’s session, saying that the Security Council should wait until investigations establish the facts in Ukraine. A rising global power, China has drawn closer to Russia in recent years, united by a shared antipathy to the United States. The divisions on the war appeared essentially unchanged since Feb. 26, when 11 of 15 Security Council members voted for a resolution condemning Russia’s invasion, Russia vetoed the measure, and three others abstained — China, India and the United Arab Emirates.

Russia’s U.N. ambassador, Vasily Nebenzya, reiterated his government’s claims — rebutted by ample evidence — that atrocities in Bucha had been faked, or had not occurred when Russians held the city. He made a number of other unsupported claims, including stating falsely that in Ukraine — where the freely elected president is a Jew who lost family members in the Holocaust — Nazis are “running the show.”

After President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia launched the war on Ukraine on Feb. 24, his military became bogged down on several fronts in the face of logistical failures and unexpectedly fierce Ukrainian resistance. Russian forces spent weeks shelling and occupying cities and towns in northern Ukraine, where they took heavy losses as they failed to capture Kyiv, the capital. Last week they pulled back from that part of the country, preparing for what Russian officials and foreign analysts said would be a shift in focus toward eastern Ukraine.

“The next pivotal battle of the war” is likely to be for the eastern city of Sloviansk, according to a report released on Tuesday by the Institute for the Study of War, based in Washington.

Revulsion over the apparent executions discovered in Bucha deepened Russia’s economic isolation, despite its denials of responsibility.

The United States has started blocking Russia from making debt payments using dollars held in American banks, a move designed to deplete its international currency reserves and potentially push Russia toward its first foreign currency debt default in a century.

And as early as Wednesday, the Biden administration is expected to announce additional sanctions against Russia for the killings of Ukrainian citizens, according to a person familiar with the plans who was not authorized to detail them publicly. The administration will expand existing sanctions against Sberbank, the largest financial institution in Russia, and implement sanctions against Alfa Bank, one of the country’s largest private lenders. The administration also plans to announce sanctions against adult children of Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president.

The Biden administration has also authorized an additional shipment of up to $100 million in military supplies that will be taken from existing Defense Department stockpiles, the Pentagon announced in an email sent to reporters Tuesday night. This comes days after an additional $300 million in defense aid was announced April 1.

And the European Union took a significant step toward overcoming resistance to curbing fuel imports from Russia, on which its member nations rely heavily. The European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, proposed cutting off imports of Russian coal — oil and natural gas remain hotly debated — and barring Russian vessels from E.U. ports as part of a new round of sanctions.

The measures, which require unanimous approval, are expected to go to a vote of E.U. ambassadors on Wednesday. Diplomats said the sanctions package would target, among others, two daughters of Mr. Putin. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and the chief E.U. diplomat, Josep Borrell Fontelles, announced plans to visit Kyiv this week and meet with Mr. Zelensky.

The Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office said that it, along with the Kyiv police, had discovered what it called a Bucha “torture chamber,” where Russian forces had left behind the bodies of five men, their hands tied, who had been tortured and killed.

Mr. Zelensky reinforced a point that U.N. officials have made repeatedly: The true extent of Ukraine’s destruction and casualties is unknown but far greater than what has been documented, because outside observers have been unable to reach some of the most devastated areas. “Now the world can see what Russia did in Bucha, but the world has yet to see what it has done in other parts of our country,” Mr. Zelensky said.

New York Times journalists on Tuesday were able for the first time to reach the town of Borodyanka, northwest of Kyiv, battered by Russian rockets and airstrikes, where the mayor estimated 200 dead lay beneath the rubble. In the besieged port of Mariupol, local officials have put the death toll in the thousands.

Fierce fighting continues along Ukraine’s southern coast, where Mariupol, largely reduced to ruins by Russian bombardment, is “the center of hell,” said Martin Griffiths, the U.N. chief of humanitarian relief.

More than 250 miles west of Mariupol, explosions shuddered through the port of Mykolaiv, a day after the mayor said Russian strikes had killed 10 people and wounded 46. He said that Russians had hit residential buildings, schools, a hospital and an orphanage in his city since the war began, and had used cluster munitions. Soldiers defending the city said that increasingly, Russian forces were hitting civilian targets.

After four consecutive days of trying and failing to send an aid convoy into Mariupol, where people are desperately short of food, water, power, heat and medicines, the International Committee of the Red Cross decided against another attempt on Tuesday.

Ukrainian officials say the Russians have prevented crucial supplies from reaching the city. Mr. Nebenzya, the Russian U.N. ambassador, said the Ukrainians had blocked the convoy, and he claimed that Russian forces had evacuated 123,500 people from Mariupol.

The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said that in fact, tens of thousands of Ukrainians, including from Mariupol, had been taken to “filtration camps” in Russia, where family members were separated and people were stripped of passports and cellphones. “I do not need to spell out what these so-called filtration camps are reminiscent of,” she said. “It’s chilling, and we cannot look away.”

Rosemary A. DiCarlo, a U.N. under secretary general, said there was credible evidence that Russia had used cluster munitions — shells that burst open to spew many smaller bomblets over a wide area — at least 24 times in populated areas of Ukraine. Most countries have signed a treaty banning cluster munitions as indiscriminate weapons with a high risk of civilian casualties, but Russia, like the United States, has not.

More than 11 million Ukrainians — about one in four — have fled their homes because of the war, including more than 4 million who have left the country, according to the United Nations, creating Europe’s largest and fastest-growing refugee crisis since World War II.

Russian forces recently captured the eastern city of Izyum, and Western analysts say they are preparing for a drive to the south and southeast, to bolster efforts to seize more of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, where Russia-backed separatists have been fighting for eight years. Many of Ukraine’s best-equipped and most experienced military units have been concentrated in that area, known as Donbas.

“Russian forces continue to make little to no progress in frontal assaults” on the portions of Donbas still held by Ukraine, the Institute for the Study of War reported.

Whether the Russians aim simply to reinforce their units in Donbas, or are planning a more ambitious effort to encircle the Ukrainian forces, capturing Sloviansk is crucial, the institute said.

In the Luhansk region on Tuesday, an attack that Ukrainians blamed on Russian forces hit a storage tank containing nitric acid, releasing a toxic cloud and prompting the regional administrator to urge people to stay inside and close their windows.

The Russian units that withdrew from the region around Kyiv, having suffered heavy casualties, extensive equipment losses and poor morale, the institute said, “are highly unlikely to be effectively deployed elsewhere in Ukraine and are likely a spent force.”

An intelligence assessment released by the British defense ministry was less definitive, but said that any Russian forces redeploying from the north would first need considerable time to repair and replace equipment, and to make up for casualties.

Blinken says US supporting Ukraine to increase pressure on Moscow

The United States wants to see the war in Ukraine “come to an end as quickly as possible” and is supporting Ukraine to increase pressure on Russia, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said.

“That’s exactly why we’re making sure that we’re doing everything we can to support Ukraine and to give them the assistance that they need to put pressure … on Russia,” Blinken said.

Blinken said he believed Ukraine can also win the war because “success” and victory is “holding on to the sovereignty and independence of their country”.

“The problem is it may take time, and in the meantime, tremendous death and destruction. But what is so powerful here is that the Ukrainians have made it very clear that they will not subjugate themselves to Vladimir Putin’s will.”

Italy’s Draghi says halting Russian gas imports ‘not on the table”‘

He said that if gas flows from Moscow were suspended Italy still had reserves to cover its needs until late October.

Italy is heavily dependent on Russia for its gas supplies, but Draghi said if a consensus emerges at the EU level to block gas imports, “we will be perfectly happy to comply”.

Zhirinovsky, 75, was admitted to hospital earlier this year after contracting COVID-19, according to Russian media, and was too ill to speak out publicly on the war in Ukraine. He had for decades aired anti-Western grievances that found an echo in President Vladimir Putin’s increasingly bitter rhetoric in the run-up to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Mariupol mayor accuses Russia of ‘burning’ corpses to try and cover up civilian killings

Mariupol’s mayor has accused Russia of attempting to cover up what he said was the killing of possibly “tens of thousands of civilians” in the city by using mobile crematoriums to burn corpses.

“One week ago, cautious estimates put the death toll at 5,000. But given the size of the city, catastrophic destruction, the duration of the blockade and fierce resistance, tens of thousands of civilians from Mariupol could have fallen victim to the occupiers,” Vadym Boychenko said in a post on Telegram.

“The world has not seen the scale of the tragedy in Mariupol since the Nazi concentration camps,” Boychenko said, accusing Russia of turning the city into a “death camp”.

Satellite images of Ukrainian civilians slaughtered in Bucha show bodies lining the streets more than two weeks ago, debunking Russian claims that the massacre was staged by Kyiv in order to frame its troops for war crimes.

Images taken of Bucha, a commuter city on the outskirts of Kyiv, on March 19 show dark objects strewn along a road - which match the exact positions where the rotting corpses of civilians were found by Ukrainian soldiers who recaptured the area from Russian forces at the weekend.

Russian forces were in control of the city at the time, strongly suggesting that it was Putin's men - and not Kyiv's - who carried out the killings. Kyiv now says at least 410 civilians were massacred in and around Bucha by the Russians while others were tortured and raped in what President Volodymyr Zelensky has described as 'genocide'.

Zelensky, who appeared shattered on a visit to the area yesterday, will today address the UN Security Council where he is expected to push world leaders to impose tougher sanctions on Russia over the atrocities, send more weapons for his armed forces, and for a war crimes probe to punish the Russian commanders responsible.

In a nightly address to the Ukrainian nation on Tuesday, he said that Western sanctions on Russia 'must finally be powerful' - adding: 'Did hundreds of our people have to die in agony for some European leaders to finally understand that the Russian state deserves the most severe pressure?'

He was also critical of the amount of military aid sent to Ukraine so-far, saying more equipment could have helped save civilian lives. 'I do not blame you - I blame only the Russian military,' he said. 'But you could have helped.'

Ukraine's allies have called the killings in Bucha war crimes, with the EU offering to send investigators to gather evidence. '(Russian President Vladimir Putin) is a war criminal,' US President Biden told reporters at the White House. 'What's happening to Bucha is outrageous and everyone's seen it.'

The White House said it would announce fresh sanctions on Moscow 'this week' with France suggesting new measures could target Russian oil and coal exports. But Germany warned it was too soon to cut off Russian gas.

'We have to cut all economic relationship to Russia, but at the moment, it's not possible to cut the gas supplies. We need some time,' German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said.

Elsewhere, the United States and Britain said they would seek Russia's suspension from the UN Human Rights Council - a move Moscow branded 'unbelievable'.

Russia has cynically asked for the Security Council to convene to discuss what it describes as Ukrainian attempts to stage a massacre in order to frame its troops, but Britain - which currently chairs the council - has refused.

The full nature of the killings in Bucha and other areas from which Russian troops have withdrawn is still being pieced together.

On Monday, the bodies of five men were found in a children's sanatorium basement in Bucha. The Ukrainian prosecutor general's office said they were unarmed civilians, who had been bound, beaten and killed by Russian troops.

And in Motyzhyn, west of Kyiv, Ukrainian police showed AFP journalists the bodies of five civilians with their hands tied, including those of the village's mayor, her husband and son.

Ukrainian officials say over 400 civilian bodies have been recovered from the Kyiv region, many of whom have been laid to rest in mass graves.

But Zelensky has warned that the deaths in Bucha could be only the tip of the iceberg, saying he had information even more people had been killed in places like nearby Borodianka.

AFP reporters who briefly visited the area saw no bodies in the streets, but locals reported many deaths.

'I know five civilians were killed,' said 58-year-old Rafik Azimov. 'But we don't know how many more are left in the basements of the ruined buildings after the bombardments.'

'I buried six people,' another resident, Volodymyr Nahornyi, said. 'More people are under the ruins.'

The Russian withdrawal from Kyiv has been seen as a pivot to a renewed offensive in the country's east and south, where Moscow wants to consolidate territory around occupied Crimea and the separatist statelets of Donetsk and Lugansk.

The Ukrainian government has warned Moscow is preparing a ""full-scale"" attack in the country's east and regional officials urged civilians to evacuate Lugansk fearing a major Russian attack.

The Pentagon estimates Russia has withdrawn about two thirds of the troops it had around Kyiv and will redeploy them to the east and south, with the White House warning the war's ""next phase could be measured in months or longer.""

Even where troops have withdrawn, fears remain, with Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko telling residents to wait before returning, citing the danger of continued shelling and the danger of unexploded munitions.

Overnight, air raid sirens rang out across much of the country, from Lviv in the west to southern Mykolaiv, where officials said Monday that Russian strikes killed 10 civilians and wounded 46.

Elsewhere in the south, concerns remain about civilians trapped in the besieged city of Mariupol.

Authorities say at least 5,000 people have been killed in the city, 90 percent of which has been destroyed, according to mayor Vadim Boichenko.

Around 130,000 residents are still trapped inside, and efforts to evacuate them are now on hold because of ""incessant"" bombing, he said.

The Red Cross said Monday a team it sent to help get civilians out of Mariupol was being held by police in Russian-controlled territory.

Europe's worst conflict in decades, sparked by Russia's invasion on February 24, has killed as many as 20,000 people, according to Ukrainian estimates.

More than 4.2 million Ukrainians have fled the country and about 6.5 million have been internally displaced, UN agencies say.

Britain's UN ambassador says a previously planned UN Security Council meeting Tuesday is certain to focus 'front and center' on the killing of large numbers of civilians in Ukraine.

Some of the dead were found with their hands tied behind their backs after Russian troops left the Ukrainian town of Bucha on the outskirts of the capital Kyiv.

The UK holds the council presidency in April, and Ambassador Barbara Woodward said Britain didn't grant Russia's request for a meeting on the situation in Bucha on Monday because 'we didn't see a good reason to have two meetings back to back on Ukraine.'

She told reporters that the Security Council will be briefed Tuesday by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths and UN political chief Rosemary DiCarlo.

Woodward said that 'the images that we saw coming out of Bucha over the weekend were harrowing, appalling, probable evidence of war crimes and possibly a genocide.'

Meanwhile, a Russian law enforcement agency has said it has launched its own investigation into allegations that Ukrainian civilians were massacred, focusing on what it calls 'false information' about Russian forces.

The Investigative Committee claims Ukrainian authorities made the allegations 'with the aim of discrediting Russian troops' and that those involved should be investigated over possible breaches of a new Russian law banning what the government deems to be false information about its forces.

Russian law enforcement has launched several investigations since Russian troops entered Ukraine, typically into incidents such as the shelling of areas held by Russia-backed separatists.

Moscow faced global revulsion and accusations of war crimes Monday after the Russian pullout from the outskirts of Kyiv revealed streets strewn with corpses of what appeared to be civilians, some of whom had seemingly been killed at close range.

The grisly images of battered bodies left out in the open or hastily buried led to calls for tougher sanctions against the Kremlin, namely a cutoff of fuel imports from Russia.

Germany and France reacted by expelling dozens of Russian diplomats, suggesting they were spies, and US President Joe Biden said Russian leader Vladimir Putin should be tried for war crimes.

On Monday, Biden called for a trial, adding to the global outcry over civilian killings in the Ukrainian town of Bucha as more graphic images of their deaths emerged.

'Obviously responsible': Pentagon spokesman John Kirby (pictured) speaks during a media briefing at the Pentagon, April 4

Meanwhile, the Pentagon said Russian forces are obviously responsible for the atrocities in Bucha, even as it acknowledged it was not yet sure precisely which units were operating in the area.

'I think it's fairly obvious, not just to us but to the world, that Russian forces are responsible for the atrocities in Bucha,' Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told a news briefing.

'Now exactly who - what units, whether they're contractors or Chechens - I don't think we're able to say right now. But we're certainly not refuting that these atrocities occurred and occurred at the hands of Russians.'

The Kremlin categorically denied any accusations relating to the murder of civilians, including in Bucha, where it said the graves and corpses had been staged by Ukraine to tarnish Russia.

Asked at a news conference about Biden's comments, Lavrov said the West should first consider its own actions in Iraq and Libya.

'Not all is well with the conscience... of American politicians,' he said.

Speaking in a broadcast last night, Vladimir Soloviev, a prominent pro-Putin personality who supports the invasion, added: 'The war against Russia entered a new phase today. Very soon we will be blamed of genocide.'

He alleged the plot was masterminded by Britain as he praised the 'true patriots' in Donbas as other sources have accused Kyiv of staging the horrifying scenes in Bucha.

Soloviev also brought up allegations of Russian troops raping young women in front of their families, at one point saying he 'doesn't even want to comment' on the topic.

It comes as the Russian defence ministry rejected the allegations and claimed that 'not a single civilian suffered from violence when the town was controlled by the Russian Armed Forces'.

Russian ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov said: 'I would like to point out that Russian troops left Bucha on March 30.

'The Ukrainian authorities remained silent all these days, and now they have suddenly posted sensational footage in order to tarnish Russia's image and make Russia defend itself.

'I would like to emphasise with full responsibility that not a single civilian suffered from violence when the town was controlled by the Russian Armed Forces.

Solviev (above), who is a pro-Putin personality, saidd: 'It's obvious people will try to blame us as a people behind genocide'

'On the contrary, our troops delivered 452 tonnes of humanitarian aid for civilians.

'Meanwhile, the fact that the Ukrainian Armed Forces shelled the town of Bucha right after Russian troops had left was deliberately ignored in the US.

'This is what could have caused civilian casualties. That said, the Kyiv regime is clearly trying to blame its atrocities on Russia.'

Konstantin Kosachev, deputy speaker of the Russian upper house of parliament, said: 'There are no doubts that it is a staging organised by Kyiv authorities.

'And the fact that the West has picked it up and is hyping it makes it an accomplice of this cynical and immoral crime.'

Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed Kyiv colluded with the West in seeking to blame Russia.

'I think that the very fact that these statements were made minutes after these materials were released leaves no doubts as for who has contracted this story,' she told state-run Rossiya-1 television channel.

She claimed the West decided immediately Russia was to blame 'based on the videos, seconds-long videos and several photos. And they are ready to pour accusations.

'No expert work done, no information from the other side throwing light on what is going on...'

She also alleged the massacres were 'a provocation staged by the Ukrainian military and radical nationalists' to disrupt peace talks.

Meanwhile the Telegram channel War on Fakes, which has been accused of spreading misinformation about the invasion, shared posts discrediting the atrocities pictured and filmed in Bucha and said it was part of a 'planned media campaign'.

One post said: 'Fake: The Russian military left Bucha, having previously left huge casualties among the civilian population.

'Truth: Notes about Bucha appeared in several foreign publications at once - it looks like a planned media campaign.

'Given that the troops left the city on March 30, where were these footage for 4 days? Their absence only confirms the fake.

'The video with the bodies is puzzling: here, at 12 seconds, the 'corpse' on the right moves its hand.

'At 30 seconds in the rearview mirror, the 'corpse' sits down. The bodies in the video seem to have been deliberately laid out in order to create a more dramatic picture.'

'This is clearly seen if you play video at a speed of 0.25 of normal.'

This was shared by the Russian Ministry of Defence Telegram channel.

Meanwhile the Kremlin today said that it categorically denied any accusations related to the murder of civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, adding that Ukrainian allegations on the matter should be treated with doubt.

Yesterday Ukrainian authorities said they were investigating possible crimes by Russian forces after finding hundreds of bodies strewn around towns outside Kyiv following Russian withdrawal from the area.

'This information must be seriously questioned,' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call.

'From what we have seen, our experts have identified signs of video falsification and other fakes.'

Peskov said that the facts and chronology of the events in Bucha did not support Ukraine's version of events and urged international leaders not to rush to judgment.

'We categorically deny any accusations,' said Peskov.

'The situation is undoubtedly serious and we would ask that many international leaders not rush with their statements, not rush with their baseless accusations, request information from different sources, and at least listen to our explanations.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10686855/Ukraine-war-Zelensky-address-Bucha-genocide.html

At the time of Joe Biden’s assumption of power, the former president had bluntly declared Vladimir Putin a “killer” to the enragement of Russians. Here we have listed the countries supporting Russia & Ukraine.

Countries Supporting Russia & Ukraine

Some or all of these organizations would rush to President Putin’s aid if Russia invaded Ukraine, despite the organization’s reluctance to deal with internal issues.

Azerbaijan (not a CSTO member) is also expected to ignore any calls for rising against Russia during a conflict. Russia’s president brokered a truce between Armenia and Azerbaijan, raging in Nagorno-Karabakh.

A ceasefire pact was only achieved after Putin’s intervention, despite the entire world calling for the war to end. A subsequent Russian deployment aimed at preventing a new ethnic conflict was placed around the disputed area. Even if Azerbaijan does not openly support Russia, it is almost sure that it won’t join forces against it.

Iranian support for Russia would go further towards the Middle East. The Iranian leadership consistently courted Russia for a rejoinder after the Nuclear Deal fell apart.

Russia has supplied arms to Iran and has cooperated with it during the Syrian war, amid rising tensions between the US and its allies on the one hand and Iran on the other.

After Qasem Soleimani’s assassination, Washington and Tehran’s relations thawed. Moscow condemned the attack without ambiguity. Iran is expected to support Russia wholeheartedly as it continues to be subjected to sanctions by the US.

However, one of the most critical factors is that the world’s largest economy, the so-called ‘Asian Dragon’ – China, is one of Russia’s major trading partners. Over the past few years, Moscow has strengthened its partnership with Beijing as tensions between the West and China have continued to escalate.

It is a known fact that both Russia and China are partners on a multi-dimensional basis, with a wide range of cooperation from business to the military to space. According to the Chinese government, the US should set aside the mentality of the Cold War and take seriously the security concerns that Russia holds. China would not hesitate to support Russia in the event of a conflict.

Countries Supporting Russia in War with Ukraine

In the article we published today, we covered the countries supporting Russia.

In this conflict, countries that were once part of the Soviet Union, including Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kyrgyzstan, will stand by Russia.

Also extending its support to Putin was Cuba, a close ally of the Russians.

Due to its good relations with the Russian Federation and Ukraine, India has maintained a neutral position as a non-aligned state.

China aims to take diplomatic measures and strike a balance between western countries and Russia. On the other side, the Chinese president Xi Jinping is eager to boost the nation’s ties with Russia, so it cannot endorse the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. Beijing’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, pleaded with all parties to be restrained.

Countries Supporting Ukraine

There is full support among NATO countries – Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It is the cause of the most massive support for Ukraine from the United States and the United Kingdom.

Germany and France made a hurried visit to Moscow recently to defuse the controversy that has newly erupted. The United States and Canada halted approval of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline after President Putin recognized two breakaway regions of Ukraine as independent nations and sent Russian troops there.

As a result of Russia’s recognition of the two Ukrainian provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk as independent countries, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and Canada are all supporting Ukraine.",https://dmerharyana.org/countries-supporting-russia-ukraine/
