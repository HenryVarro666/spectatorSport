A video widely shared on social media purportedly showed how the people of the village, identified as Nova Basan, were overwhelmed with joy to greet their country‚Äôs servicemen and women.

The village, located in the Chernihiv region, is about 55 miles east of Kyiv.

Radio Free Liberty reported that the Ukrainian General Staff of the Armed Forces identified Nova Basan as liberated from the Russians on Friday morning.

‚ÄúAfter the departure of the enemy, units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine took control of the settlements of Rudnya, Shevchenkove, Bobryk, Stara Basan, Nova Basan, Makeyevka, Pogreby, Bazhanivka, Volodymyrivka, Shnyakivka, Salne, Sofiivka, Gavrylivka,‚Äù the high command of the Ukrainian military in a statement.

The village was recaptured as Ukrainian forces advanced through the Chernihiv region following a Russian retreat in the area, according to Reuters.

The outlet reported that Ukrainian officials said the towns of Bucha, Ivankiv and Borodyanka in the northern Kyiv region also had been retaken, although it said it was ‚Äúunable to verify immediately the information.‚Äù

In the Nova Basan video, residents ‚Äî seemingly traumatized by a brief experience of Russian occupation ‚Äî greeted the Ukrainian soldiers with fruits and gifts.

A Twitter user provided a translation of the words exchanged between Ukrainian troops and civilians.

One civilian said his house had been hit with machine-gun fire during the occupation, according to the translation.

A Ukrainian soldier confirmed that the forces were entering the town for the first time and that fighting against Russian forces in the region hadn‚Äôt yet concluded.

Russian authorities announced they were pulling back troops from the Chernihiv and Kyiv regions following fierce resistance from Ukrainians to defend their nation‚Äôs capital.

According to some accounts on Twitter, Ukrainian troops claimed to have captured several armored vehicles in the offensive liberating Nova Basan, including Russian T-72 tanks and personnel carriers.

The footage, collected by a drone and published by a Ukrainian volunteer unit on Telegram, shows what appears to be a single well-positioned Ukrainian T-64 tank ambushing a convoy of Russian BTR-82A armoured vehicles on a road in Nova Basan, west of the capital.

Thanks to brilliant positioning, the tank was able to fire several rounds at the invaders‚Äô convoy, threading the gap between other structures from a concealed location behind a house.

One BTR was quickly set ablaze in the attack, prompting the remaining armoured vehicles to fire back, seemingly aiming at other targets off-camera as yellow flashes of fire were seen streaking across the fields surrounding the road.

But the T-64 appeared unsighted and continued to pound the convoy with shells as it outsmarted the Russian troops until further artillery reinforcements arrived.

The second half of the video cuts to later footage of Ukrainian artillery strikes raining down on the convoy as it attempts to flee, before zooming in on the wreckage of a Russian tank still on fire alongside several corpses.

Fantastic drone footage has emerged showing the remarkable courage and tactics of a single Ukrainian tank, which successfully ambushed a whole column of Russian armoured vehicles

The convoy fired rounds into nearby buildings and also directed fire across neighbouring fields, seemingly at targets off camera, but the lone Ukrainian tank remained hidden as it continued to pound the invaders with shells, ultimately destroying two vehicles

The date of the ambush was not given, but it is thought to have taken place last week, given that the majority of Russian forces retreated from towns and villages around Kyiv late last week and over the weekend.

Geolocation shows the ambush took place along the HO7 highway which runs through Nova Basan, connecting Kyiv with the Western cities of Sumy and Kharkiv.

Meanwhile, images published on April 1 showed Ukrainian soldiers inspecting a series of burnt-out Russian tanks and BTRs in Nova Basan, which may well have been the remnants of the effective ambush.

The Ukrainian tank managed to operate incredibly effectively against the Russian armour, despite the considerable discrepancy in their technology.

The T-64 is a Soviet-era machine, first deployed as early as the 1960s, and Ukraine inherited thousands of the vehicles when the Soviet Union collapsed.

Armoured vehicle technology has since moved on massively ‚Äì the Russian BTRs that were destroyed in the clip only entered service a decade ago ‚Äì but Ukraine still relies heavily on the ageing tanks as the bulk of its military might.

Images published in January less than a month prior to the Russian invasion showed scores of T-64 tanks left out in the snow, waiting to be retrofitted with upgraded armour and weapons at a tank repair plant in Kharkiv.

The footage of the daring ambush emerged as Ukrainian authorities claim Russia‚Äôs death toll in the war is nearing 20,000.

Ukraine‚Äôs armed forces are continuing to push back invading Kremlin troops and retake ‚Äòkey terrain‚Äô around the capital and other eastern cities, while Putin‚Äôs forces retreat to refocus their efforts on the Donbas.

In an intelligence update posted yesterday, Britain‚Äôs MoD said that due to the scale of the damage, many of Russian units ‚Äòare likely to require significant re-equipping and refurbishment before being available to redeploy for operations in eastern Ukraine.‚Äô

However, Russian forces are continuing to conduct brutal bombing campaigns in cities like Mariupol where the civilian death toll has risen to 5,000.

Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said that even though Ukraine is taking back the capital, he urged civilians not to return for ‚Äòat least another week‚Äô, with explosives left around the city, and described the situation in east of Ukraine as ‚Äòcritical‚Äô.

Elsewhere, Ukraine‚Äôs general staff said Russia has again used banned cluster munitions in Mykolaiv, targeting civilian buildings including a children hospital in a horrific attack which has killed 11 and wounded 61.",https://expressdigest.com/incredible-moment-single-ukrainian-tank-takes-on-entire-russian-convoy-near-kyiv/
3,4884972d-7ad5-4de1-b4bc-b7bce4280032,[],,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russian forces have established a deployment cite at a church northwest of Kyiv and are using it as a staging ground as part of their assault on the Ukrainian capital, a senior U.S. administration official said on Friday.

""Military personnel are situated both on the grounds of the church and the surrounding residential area,"" the official said on condition of anonymity and without citing evidence. The official said the information was based on declassified intelligence.

""We believe the Russian military is using this staging point as part of its assault on Kyiv,"" the official said.

After failing to capture a single major Ukrainian city in five weeks of war, Russia says it is pulling back from northern Ukraine and shifting its focus to the southeast, including Mariupol.

Russia has painted its draw-down in the north of Ukraine as goodwill gesture for peace talks. Ukraine and its allies say the Russian forces have been forced to regroup after sustaining heavy losses due to poor logistics and tough Ukrainian resistance.

Over the past 10 days, Ukrainian forces have recaptured suburbs near Kyiv, broken the siege of Sumy in the east and driven back Russian forces advancing on Mykolaiv in the south.

The big news for now: Check out NASA FIRMS satellite imagery, designed to spot forest fires, but also great at tracking the front lines of a war. This is Kyiv and Chernihiv today:

What we‚Äôre seeing there is a whole lot of ‚Ä¶ nothing. The artillery has stopped. For comparison, here is imagery from a few days ago:

Russia actually pulled out. Its surrender in the Battle for Kyiv is complete.

While we still don‚Äôt have visual confirmation, this was reported earlier today:

Hostomel is just north of Bucha, the site of some of the most vicious fighting in this war. You might recall in the early days of the war, when Russia kept air-dropping airborne VDV forces at the airport, while still surrounded by enemy territory, costing Russia hundreds of dead paratroopers. Eventually, Russia‚Äôs land forces reached the airport and Bucha, and that‚Äôs where the assault was stopped, on the Irpin River, at the city of Irpin. (Rivers have been key to Ukraine‚Äôs survival during this war.)

Russia paid handsomely for Hostomel in blood, equipment, and treasure. Thousands are likely dead, including some of their most elite soldiers. And now? They‚Äôre walking away from it, defeated. It was either that or be wiped out as Ukrainian forces tightened their grip on the Bucha salient, and were close to completely cutting it off from its supply lines.

Russia‚Äôs attempt to save face is ludicrous on its face. They‚Äôve claimed the retreat is a gesture of peace and goodwill, as negotiations go nowhere. They claim Kyiv was never a goal, but a diversion to make gains in the Donbas region.

If true, this would be the most inept and failed diversion in military history. Diversions aren‚Äôt supposed to tie up your best troops and cost thousands of lives while the main force remains bogged down in trench warfare. Yes, Russia made gains in other fronts, but they are being rolled back in the south and northeast, while Russia‚Äôs gains in the eastern Donbas front remain scant.

x Putin's War - The Daily Brief - March 31

5 weeks ago, Russia invaded Ukraine. After some initial gains, their progress rapidly slowed. Now, every day for the past week, Ukraine has retaken more territory than it's lost.

See this thread for a series of maps and downloadable data. pic.twitter.com/MhsWKfrCDk ‚Äî Nathan Ruser (@Nrg8000) March 31, 2022

Look at all that yellow‚Äîterritory Ukraine has recaptured from Russia. And the map above is already out of date, missing liberated towns south of Chernihiv. Ukraine has even clawed back some of Russia‚Äôs gains in that eastern front. So truly, if the Kyiv front was a diversion, it was an utter failure at ‚Ä¶ everything. It failed as an attack on Kyiv, it failed to tie down enough Ukrainian forces to prevent their successful defense of the war‚Äôs other fronts, and it failed to give Russia the major eastern victories that they now claim were their main focus of the war.

So what now? Russia will apparently move those elite Russian Airborne Forces (known as VDV) units from the Kyiv front to the Donbas front to face off against Ukrainians in trenches. Maybe they‚Äôll send them to Izyum, which they hope to break to begin the encirclement of Ukraine‚Äôs army in Eastern Ukraine. Maybe they‚Äôll go down to Mariupol, which still hasn‚Äôt fallen to Russia despite five weeks of encirclement and 95% destruction. Meanwhile, Ukraine will leave the defense of Kyiv to capable territorial defense forces, and also shift its regular army forces to other fronts.

Indeed, given the importance of Kyiv to the Ukrainian government, there was likely an outsized military defensive presence in the city. Freeing up those units may prove a net-positive for Ukraine when the final accounting of the war is tallied.

One of the soldiers then shoots the man three times. After the second shot, the man keeps moving but stops after the third bullet.

There appear to be at least three other Russian soldiers dead lying near the latest victim, all wearing camouflage and three with white arm bands typically worn by Russian military units.

The video was taken from a road just north of Dmytrivka, about seven miles southwest of Bucha, where survivors from the month-long occupation of the town have just begun to describe their gruesome treatment at the hands of Putin‚Äôs invading troops, after area was liberated by Ukrainian forces this week.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian soldiers have also used one of Moscow‚Äôs captured thermobaric weapons against Russian troops.

They fired the feared ‚Äòblazing sun‚Äô TOS-1A rocket launcher near Izyum in eastern Ukraine. The ‚Äòvacuum bombs‚Äô suck in oxygen from the target area, creating a blast that can destroy internal organs. They are illegal to use against civilians, but are lawful against military targets

Despite the heroics of the Ukrainian army, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg today warned the war in Ukraine could last ‚Äòmonths, even years‚Äô as there is no sign Vladimir Putin has lost ‚Äòhis ambition to control the whole country‚Äô.

Ukrainian authorities urged civilians in the country‚Äôs east to flee ‚Äònow‚Äô or ‚Äòrisk death‚Äô as Russian forces regroup ahead of what is expected to be a fresh offensive in the Donbas region.

Stoltenberg, speaking ahead of a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels, said the international community should be ‚Äòrealistic‚Äô about Moscow‚Äôs intentions and ‚Äòrealise that this may last for a long time‚Äô as the war entered its 41st day.

‚ÄòWe need also to be prepared for the long haul, both when it comes to supporting Ukraine, sustaining sanctions and strengthening our defences,‚Äô he added.

Victims ‚Äòblown up with a grenade‚Äô, a father shot dead in front of his 14-year-old son and troops who ‚Äòexecuted all men under 50‚Äô: Horrifying details emerge of Russian atrocities in Bucha By Jack Newman and Chris Pleasance for MailOnline Charred body parts lay scattered over the streets of Bucha for days after a man was killed with a grenade, while men were stripped naked, tied up and summarily executed by Russians, traumatised civilians have revealed as vile stories emerge from the Ukrainian town. Survivors from the month-long occupation of the town in Kyiv oblast have started to describe their gruesome treatment at the hands of Putin‚Äôs invading troops after area was liberated. Mykola, a 53-year-old resident, spent a month hiding in the cold and dark cellar of his apartment building with his wife after witnessing callous executions on the streets of his hometown. He told ABC that when the Russians arrived, they killed all men aged under 50 and then ordered him to bury his friends within 20 minutes. Two of his friends were shot in front of him and another was hit by a grenade, blowing his body to pieces, which lay untouched for days until Mykola was allowed to quickly gather his parts in a bag and bury them in a shallow grave to ward off the dogs. Vanya Skyba told The Economist how Russians rounded up a group of builders, ordered them to strip naked and lie face down on the floor while their bodies and phones were searched for evidence of military tattoos or anti-Russian sentiment. One of the men was killed as an example to make the group talk, forcing one of the men to admit he had been a member of Ukraine‚Äôs territorial defence who had served in the Donbas, prompting the Kremlin thugs to execute him too. The others were beaten and tortured until an order to kill was issued by a Russian saying: ‚ÄòF***ing do them in.‚Äô They were led to the side of the building and each shot, and Skyba took a bullet in the side which went through his body. He played dead on the concrete floor until he heard silence when he fled over a fence to a nearby home. He was later found there by Russians from a different unit who believed his cover story he was the owner of the home, but they led him back to the cellar where he had been shot where he sheltered with a dozens woman and children until they were freed. After the savage killings, locals said Putin‚Äôs army occupied the dead civilians‚Äô homes, drinking their alcohol, partying and stealing their belongings.

Members of the trans-Atlantic alliance had until today given Ukraine only anti-tank and anti-craft missiles, small arms and protective equipment, but not offered heavy armour or fighter jets.

Several BVP-1 infantry fighting vehicles, howitzer artillery pieces and more than a dozen T-72 tanks were yesterday loaded on a train bound for Slovakia where they are expected to head on to Ukraine, footage run by public broadcaster Czech Television showed.

The Czech delivery has been funded by Prague as well as private donors who have contributed to a crowdsourced fundraising campaign to supply arms to Kyiv.

Ukraine burns through in a single day the same amount of weaponry it receives in a week, according to a senior Polish official, and Kyiv‚Äôs eastern neighbours are concerned with keeping up with demand.

Prague, and neighbouring Slovakia which has no tanks to give, are also considering helping repair and refit damaged Ukrainian military equipment. Germany will send several dozen infantry fighting vehicles to Kyiv and the UK has approved the delivery of 20 ambulances.

The United States has agreed to provide an additional $100 million in assistance to Ukraine, including Javelin anti-armour systems, the Pentagon said on Tuesday. US chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) said it had suspended business operations in Russia, joining a growing list of companies leaving the country.

NATO has already supplied fuel, ammunition, helmets, protective gear and medical supplies to Ukraine, Stoltenberg said yesterday.

President Joe Biden has in recent weeks ordered more US troops to NATO‚Äôs eastern flank to reassure edgy allies and pledged to protect the bloc‚Äôs territory if Russian forces stray over more borders.

Ukraine‚Äôs deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk today said in a message on Telegram that residents of the country‚Äôs eastern regions should evacuate ‚Äònow‚Äô or ‚Äòrisk death‚Äô due to a feared Russian attack.

‚ÄòThe governors of the Kharkiv, Lugansk and Donetsk regions are calling on the population to leave these territories and are doing everything to ensure that the evacuations take place in an organised manner,‚Äô she said.

The call for urgent evacuations comes as Ukraine says Russian forces are regrouping to launch a fresh offensive in the country‚Äôs east after retreating from the Kyiv region.

Vereshchuk asked residents to cooperate with authorities, saying Kyiv will ‚Äònot be able to help‚Äô them after an attack.

‚ÄòIt has to be done now because later people will be under fire and face the threat of death. There is nothing they will be able to do about it, nor will we be able to help,‚Äô she said.

‚ÄòIt is necessary to evacuate as long as this possibility exists. For now, it still exists,‚Äô she added.

Russian forces last week pulled back from positions outside Kyiv and shifted the focus of their assault away from the capital, and Ukraine‚Äôs general staff said the northeastern city of Kharkiv, the country‚Äôs second-largest, also remained under attack.

Authorities in the eastern region of Luhansk on Wednesday urged residents to get out ‚Äòwhile it is safe‚Äô from an area that Ukraine also expects to be the target of a new offensive.

The Kremlin has declared that Ukraine‚Äôs Donbas is now a priority for the Russian army. NATO believes Moscow aims to take control of the whole Donbas region in eastern Ukraine with the aim of creating a corridor from Russia to annexed Crimea.
