Abramovich's superyachts docked in Turkish resorts

ISTANBUL, March 29 (Reuters) - Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, who is sanctioned by the West over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, made a surprise appearance in Istanbul on Tuesday at the first direct peace talks in weeks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators.

The two teams sat facing each other at a long table in the presidential office on an Ottoman palace grounds. The Russian oligarch sat in the front row of observers wearing a blue suit, a Turkish presidential video showed.

In the most tangible sign yet of progress towards ending the war, Russia emerged from the talks promising to scale down military operations around Kyiv and the country's north, and Ukraine proposed adopting a neutral status. read more

For Abramovich, signals have emerged since the war began that he has sought to encourage negotiations, and he has travelled to Ukraine, Russia, Turkey and Israel in March. Two of his superyachts are docked at Turkish resorts.

His presence initially baffled at least one Ukrainian diplomat, while Moscow said he was not formally negotiating but rather there as a go-between and had approval from the Ukrainian side. read more

A spokesman for Abramovich did not respond to a request for comment. Abramovich showed no signs of a reported suspected poisoning early this month.

The Wall Street Journal and investigative outlet Bellingcat, citing people familiar with the matter, said Abramovich and Ukrainian negotiators suffered symptoms of suspected poisoning after a meeting in Kyiv. read more

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the poisoning reports as untrue and part of an ""information war"".

NATO member Turkey shares a maritime border with Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea, has good ties with both and has offered to mediate the conflict. While calling Moscow's invasion unacceptable, Ankara has also opposed the Western sanctions.

In a speech ahead of the talks by the Bosphorus strait, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan told the delegations the time had come for concrete results and that progress would pave the way for a meeting of the countries' two leaders.

""It is up to the sides to stop this tragedy. Achieving a ceasefire and peace as soon as possible is to the benefit of everyone,"" he said.

Footage released by Kyiv showed Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov being warmly greeted by his Turkish counterpart ahead of the talks at the Dolmabahce palace grounds.

Reznikov, who was not wearing a face mask, joked with Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar that Ukraine had scrapped COVID-19 precautions when Russia invaded.

Russian forces invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. Putin called it a ""special military operation"" to demilitarize Ukraine. Ukraine and the West say Putin launched an unprovoked war of aggression.

SUPERYACHTS IN TURKEY

Commenting on Abramovich's presence, Ukrainian ambassador to Britain Vadym Prystaiko told the BBC: ""I have no idea what Mr Abramovich is claiming or doing. He is not a part of the negotiation team.""

Peskov told reporters on a conference call Abramovich was not an official member of the Russian delegation at the talks, but acknowledged his presence there to ""enable certain contacts"" between sides. read more

The Kremlin has said he played an early role in talks but the process was now up to negotiating teams. TV video showed he sat next to Erdogan's spokesman and adjusted his headphones to listen to the president's speech. read more

The West has imposed heavy sanctions on Abramovich and other Russian billionaires, Russian companies and officials, in a bid to force Putin to withdraw from Ukraine.

Abramovich had sought to sell his English soccer club Chelsea, a process that was taken out of his hands by the British government when it blacklisted him.

Superyachts linked to him, together worth an estimated $1.2 billion, have been docked at Bodrum and Marmaris in southwest Turkey since last week. Sources have said he and other wealthy Russians were looking to invest in Turkey given sanctions elsewhere. read more

Its potential as a safe haven for Russian investment raises risks for Turkey's government, banks and businesses that could face penalties if the United States and others pressure Moscow with broader ""secondary"" sanctions. read more

In a speech he delivered at the start of negotiations, Erdogan said progress in the talks could pave the way for a meeting between the leaders of the two countries.

“We believe that there will be no losers in a just peace. Prolonging the conflict is not in anyone’s interest,” he said. “As members of the delegations you have taken on a historic responsibility. The whole world is awaiting the good news that will come from you.”

“The two parties have legitimate concerns, it’s possible to reach a solution acceptable to the international community,” Erdogan said. “It’s up to the two parties to put an end to this tragedy,” he insisted, adding that the “extension of the conflict is in no one’s interest.”

It is the first time that the two countries’ delegations, which arrived in Turkey on Monday, met after several rounds of talks by videoconference.

The delegations are scheduled to hold two days of talks in a government building adjacent to the 19th-century Ottoman palace, Dolmabahce, on the shores of the Bosporus.

Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu was also due to meet the Ukrainian and Russian delegations on Tuesday.

Earlier talks between the sides, held in person in Belarus or by video, failed to make progress on ending the monthlong war that has killed thousands and driven more than 10 million Ukrainians from their homes — including almost 4 million from their country.

Turkey previously hosted on March 10 a first meeting between the Ukrainian and Russian foreign ministers following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24. Those talks in the southern city of Antalya failed to produce a ceasefire or make any other visible progress.

Turkey, which shares a Black Sea coast with both Russia and Ukraine, is seeking to maintain good relations with both and has offered to mediate since the start of the war.

Ankara is a traditional ally of Kyiv’s and has supplied the country with Bayraktar drones, which Ukraine has deployed in the conflict.

But it is also seeking to stay on good terms with Russia, on which Turkey relies heavily for gas imports and tourism revenues.

Turkey is also working with France and Greece on a “humanitarian operation” to evacuate people from the devastated Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, which has been pounded by Russian forces.

Ahead of the current talks in Istanbul, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country was prepared to declare its neutrality, as Moscow has demanded, in comments that might lend momentum to negotiations.

Zelensky said over the weekend that compromise might be possible over “the complex issue of Donbas,” the hotly contested region in the country’s east. It’s unclear how that might be reconciled with his stance that “Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are beyond doubt.”

Russia has long demanded that Ukraine drop any hope of joining NATO, which Moscow sees as a threat. Zelensky, for his part, has stressed that Ukraine needs security guarantees of its own as part of any deal.

As fighting raged throughout the country, the mayor of Irpin, which has been the scene of some of the heaviest fighting, said late Monday that the city had been “liberated” from Russian forces.

A senior US defense official said the US believes the Ukrainians have also retaken the town of Trostyanets, south of Sumy, in the east.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss US intelligence assessments, said Russian forces largely remained in defensive positions near the capital, Kyiv, and were making little forward progress elsewhere in the country.

The official said Russia appeared to be deemphasizing ground operations near Kyiv and concentrating more on the Donbas, the predominantly Russian-speaking region where Moscow-backed rebels have been waging a separatist war for eight years.

Late last week, with its forces bogged down in parts of the country, Russia seemed to scale back its war aims, saying its main goal was gaining control of the Donbas.

The possible face-saving exit strategy for Russian President Vladimir Putin has raised Ukrainian fears the Kremlin aims to split the country, forcing it to surrender a swath of its territory.

In recent days, Ukrainian troops have pushed the Russians back in other sectors.

In the city of Makariv, near a strategic highway west of the capital, Associated Press reporters saw the carcass of a Russian rocket launcher, a burned Russian truck, the body of a Russian soldier and a destroyed Ukrainian tank after fighting there a few days ago.

In the nearby village of Yasnohorodka, the AP witnessed positions abandoned by Ukrainian soldiers who had moved farther west, but no sign of Russian troops.

Russia has destroyed more than 60 religious buildings across the country in just over a month of war, with most of the damage concentrated near Kyiv and in the east, Ukraine’s military said in a post on Tuesday.

It said the Orthodox church – the country’s majority religion – was the most affected but that mosques, synagogues, Protestant churches and religious schools were also destroyed.

A cyberattack knocked Ukraine’s national telecommunications provider Ukrtelecom almost completely offline on Monday. The chief of Ukraine’s state service for special communication, Yurii Shchyhol, blamed “the enemy” without specifically naming Russia and said most customers were cut off from telephone, internet and mobile service to ensure coverage for Ukraine’s military.

Also Monday, an oil depot in western Ukraine’s Rivne region was hit by a missile, the governor said, in the second attack on oil facilities in the region near the Polish border.

In other developments, Ukraine’s prosecutor general said at least 144 children have died in the war so far, most in Kyiv. The tally did not give a number for the besieged eastern city of Mariupol.

Meanwhile, Bloomberg News said it has suspended its operations in Russia and Belarus. Customers in both countries won’t be able to access any Bloomberg financial products and trading functions for Russian securities were disabled in line with international sanctions, it said. Bloomberg Philanthropies pledged $40 million, meanwhile, in support of Ukrainians and refugees.

Also, The Group of Seven major economies rejected a Kremlin demand that some countries pay in rubles for Russia’s natural gas. That demand appeared designed to support the Russian currency, which is under pressure from Western sanctions.

Putin’s ground forces have become bogged down because of stronger-than-expected Ukrainian resistance, combined with what Western officials say are Russian tactical missteps, poor morale, shortages of food, fuel and cold weather gear, and other problems. Moscow has resorted to pummeling Ukrainian cities with artillery and airstrikes.

The Pentagon may have to ask Congress for additional money to support Ukraine’s battle against Russia’s invasion, including replenishing America’s arsenal for weapons sent to Kyiv, officials said Monday.

Rolling out the Defense Department’s $773 billion request for fiscal 2023, Pentagon leaders said the budget was finalized before the invasion so it has no specific money for the war. Congress approved a $13.5 billion emergency funding package in early March.

The leaders said it was too early to predict how quickly Ukrainian forces will use up the weapons and ammunition already being provided, and how much the US will need to replace what it sends to Ukraine, such as Stinger and Javelin missiles or body armor and other equipment.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/as-ukraine-russia-peace-talks-kick-off-in-istanbul-erdogan-urges-end-to-tragedy/

Ukrainian and Russian Negotiators Meet in Turkey

Diplomats from Ukraine and Russia are meeting in Istanbul today for another round of negotiations. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened the talks by calling for an immediate cease-fire and saying that “we should expect solid outcomes.”

Although major breakthroughs aren’t expected, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed his willingness to discuss some of the Kremlin’s demands: declaring neutrality, staying out of NATO, and pledging not to develop its own nuclear arsenal. Even so, Zelensky has said that a potential deal would need to be determined in a national referendum and would require security guarantees and the removal of Russian forces.

“Security guarantees and neutrality, the non-nuclear status of our state—we’re ready to do that,” Zelensky said on Sunday. “That’s the most important point … they started the war because of it.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, is reportedly no longer pushing to “de-Nazify” Ukraine and is now willing to allow Kyiv to join the European Union as long as it practices military nonalignment, according to the Financial Times.

But officials and Russia experts remain skeptical of whether Putin is actually seeking a diplomatic resolution to the war, especially as Russian forces continue to intensify their missile strikes on Ukrainian cities, worsening the war’s humanitarian fallout.

“The Russians are still looking for a battlefield victory, and Ukrainians are not willing to cave,” Daniel Fried, a distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council and former U.S. ambassador to Poland, told Foreign Policy.

If negotiations fail to produce diplomatic breakthroughs, as many experts expect, what could come next? After consulting more than a dozen Western officials, military analysts, and regional experts, my colleagues Amy Mackinnon, Jack Detsch, and Robbie Gramer have outlined five broad outcomes that could emerge from the war: a bloody stalemate, the partition of Ukraine, a decisive victory, a peace agreement, or a black swan event like a Russian nuclear attack or Putin’s fall from power.

Until then, they write, many analysts fear that the conflict will only deepen as Putin continues his assault on Ukrainian cities and civilian targets—and shows little signs of giving in.

“I’m encouraged by the fact that there’s negotiations,” said Paul Stronski, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. But as long as the fighting intensifies and the shelling of civilian areas continues, he said, “I don’t have high hopes.”

“I think the worst could still be ahead of us,” he added.

What We’re Following Today

Shanghai’s sweeping lockdown. As cases of the omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus surge in China, the country has imposed a lockdown in half of Shanghai—its biggest since the pandemic first began two years ago. Shanghai has been grappling with a staggering spike in largely asymptomatic COVID-19 cases: On Sunday, the city reported 3,500 new cases, 50 of which were symptomatic.

To curb the spread of the virus, the city—home to 25 million people—will implement a two-phase lockdown based around the Huangpu River, which divides the city. From Monday to Friday, the eastern side of the river will be under lockdown; those west of the river will face the same restrictions in the four days after.

El Salvador cracks down on gang violence. After El Salvador was rocked by a severe wave of gang violence—at least 62 people were killed on Saturday, the country’s deadliest day in three decades—the government has declared a 30-day state of emergency. Under this order, the government can suspend several constitutional guarantees and lift certain arrest restrictions, while prisons are locked down.

“All the cells locked 24/7, nobody goes out even to the yard,” El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele tweeted on Sunday. “Message to the gangs: Because of your actions, now your ‘homeboys’ won’t be able to see a ray of sunshine.”

Historic security summit. Top diplomats from the United States, Israel, Bahrain, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and Morocco convened in a historic security summit in Israel on Monday. At the summit—the first such meeting to be held in Israel—the participants worked to coordinate efforts against Iran, while also urging Israel to revive talks with Palestinian leaders. “We have to be clear that these regional peace agreements are not a substitute for progress between Palestinians and Israelis,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.

Keep an Eye On

Indian workers strike. Since Monday, millions of workers across India have been taking part in a two-day nationwide strike to demand greater rights and protest the government’s economic policies, which they say hurt workers and farmers. With both public and private sector workers marching, their demonstrations have blocked roads, highways, and railway tracks across states.

Massacre in Mexico. Armed gunmen attacked an illegal cockfighting arena in western Mexico on Sunday night, killing 20 people. Although it’s still unclear who was behind the attack—or what their motive was—witnesses report seeing a massacre in which gunmen equipped with assault rifles opened fire late on Sunday night. Outside, two parked trucks blocked the highway to the cockfighting pit.

Odds and Ends

Four Chinese badminton players have been charged with a peculiar crime: failing to play their best during a doubles match at the 2018 Fuzhou Open.

During the match, observing Danish players told the referee they didn’t believe the players—a world-ranked No. 2 pair and a No. 17-ranked pair—were playing seriously. After the referee stepped in and asked all of the players to try their best during the second game, the match’s intensity improved—but they were ultimately charged after the No. 17 pair won.

In March, a Badminton World Federation disciplinary panel announced that the players were found guilty of failing to try their best. As a punishment, all will face temporary bans and have to hand over their prize money from the competition.",https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/03/29/russia-ukraine-turkey-erdogan-war-peace-talks-negotiations-diplomacy/

Addressing the Russian and Ukrainian delegations who are in Istanbul for peace talks, Erdoğan sounded optimistic that progress can be made and said Turkey would be pleased to host a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, both of whom he referred to as ""valuable friends.""

""We hope the meetings will be beneficial for both countries and the region, as Turkey is deeply worried about the conflict,"" he said.

The president said the negotiation process between Russia and Ukraine has increased hopes for peace and that ensuring a cease-fire as soon as possible would benefit all parties. He congratulated the delegations from both sides for exerting great efforts and said that they have the prerogative to end the tragedy, which has killed thousands of Ukrainians and destroyed cities.

Stressing that Turkey has been displaying a fair stance that emphasizes the rights of both sides, Erdoğan said it is about time that the talks start producing results. He also noted that Turkey has not hesitated to undertake responsibility for peace and stability in the region.

“We believe that there will be no loser in a fair peace deal,” the president said, adding that the world is awaiting good news from Istanbul.

Erdoğan said he will be leaving for the Uzbek capital Tashkent but Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu will stay in Turkey for the remainder of the meetings and is prepared to provide assistance if needed.

""I know that you will not hesitate to take the initiative to re-facilitate peace,"" he said.

The Russian and Ukrainian delegations arrived in Istanbul on Monday.

They met at the Dolmabahçe working office in Istanbul’s Beşiktaş district.

""I can express that the phone calls we've maintained with (Russian President) Mr. (Vladimir) Putin and (Ukrainian President) Mr. (Volodymyr) Zelenskyy are heading in a favorable direction,"" Erdoğan said at a news conference after a cabinet meeting at the presidential complex in the capital Ankara a day earlier.

""Today, we are the country that makes the most effort towards peace, and the only country in which both sides trust its fairness, sincerity, and friendship,"" he said.

Security guarantees and organizing a cease-fire to resolve humanitarian problems were being discussed at talks in Turkey between Ukraine and Russia on Tuesday, an adviser to Zelenskyy said.

""Intensive consultations are underway right now on some important issues, the most important of which is agreement on international security guarantees for Ukraine, because with this agreement we will be able to end the war as Ukraine needs,"" said political adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on national television.

""The second issue is a cease-fire to solve all the humanitarian problems that have accumulated,"" he said.

He said another problem was the ""escalation of the war"" including what he said, without giving details, was the ""violation of the rules of war.""

On Monday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said his country’s most ambitious goal at talks with Russia in Turkey this week is to agree on a cease-fire.

“The minimum program will be humanitarian questions, and the maximum program is reaching an agreement on a cease-fire,” he said on national television when asked about the scope of the latest round of peace negotiations. He noted that security guarantees would have to be followed by a referendum in Ukraine. Kuleba noted that the issue of holding a referendum will not be discussed in the negotiations in Turkey and that this is an internal matter of Ukraine.

After holding a phone call with Çavuşoğlu, Kuleba said he is grateful for Turkey hosting the next round of talks.

""I hope that under Turkish mediation leadership these negotiations will bring results serving the interests of peace in Ukraine and our security,"" he said on Twitter.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also said they hope to have successful results in the peace talks.

""So far we cannot state any significant achievements or breakthroughs,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters, adding that it was ""important"" that it had been decided to continue the talks in person.

Lavrov also said that a meeting between President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy should happen once the two sides are closer to agreeing on key issues.

Earlier peace talks between the sides held both via video and in-person failed to make progress.

Zelenskyy hinted that Ukraine is prepared to declare its neutrality and consider a compromise on contested areas in the country’s east to secure peace – but he said only a face-to-face meeting with Putin can end the war. A meeting like that hasn't happened yet. He said late that he will insist on assurances that his country's sovereignty and territorial integrity will be respected at the meeting.

""Our priorities in the negotiations are known: sovereignty, territorial integrity of Ukraine are beyond doubt,"" Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address. ""Effective guarantees of security are a must. Obviously, our goal is peace and return to normal life in our country as soon as possible.""

“We must come to an agreement with the president of the Russian Federation, and in order to reach an agreement, he needs to get out of there on his own feet ... and come to meet me,"" Zelenskyy said in an interview that Russia barred its media from publishing.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Monday that the two presidents could meet, but only after the key elements of a potential deal are negotiated.

“The meeting is necessary once we have clarity regarding solutions on all key issues,” Lavrov said in an interview with Serbian media. He accused Ukraine of only wanting to “imitate talks,” and said Russia needs concrete results.

In an overnight video address to his nation, Zelenskyy said Ukraine is seeking peace “without delay” in the talks.

While saying “Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are beyond doubt,” Zelenskyy also suggested compromise might be possible over Donbas, the predominantly Russian-speaking eastern region of Ukraine where Moscow-backed rebels have been fighting a separatist war for the past eight years. With its forces bogged down elsewhere, Moscow recently said its focus is now on securing the Donbas.

Ankara hosted the foreign ministers of Russia and Ukraine in Antalya earlier this month. Foreign Ministers Lavrov of Russia and Kuleba of Ukraine met for talks in the Turkish resort town of Antalya, which Çavuşoğlu also attended. The talks were largely inconclusive, but Ankara considers the fact that they took place at all a success.

Maintaining its neutral and balanced stance, Turkey continues its diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the Ukraine conflict, urging all sides to exercise restraint. While Ankara has opposed international sanctions designed to isolate Moscow, it also closed its straits to prevent some Russian vessels from crossing through them.

NATO ally Turkey borders Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea and has good ties with both. Since the beginning of the conflict, Ankara has offered to mediate between the two sides and host peace talks, underlining its support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty. Having recently called Russia’s invasion an unacceptable violation of international law, Turkey has carefully formulated its rhetoric not to offend Moscow, with which it has close energy, defense and tourism ties.

While forging close ties with Russia in a number of areas and relying heavily on Russian tourists, Turkey has sold drones to Ukraine, which angered Moscow. Turkey also opposes Russian policies in Syria and Libya, as well as Moscow's annexation of Crimea. President Erdoğan has repeatedly said Turkey will not abandon its relations with Russia or Ukraine, underlining that Ankara's ability to speak to both sides is an asset.

The Russia-Ukraine war, which started on Feb. 24, has met international outrage with the EU, United States and the United Kingdom, among others, imposing tough financial sanctions on Moscow.",https://www.dailysabah.com/politics/diplomacy/progress-at-peace-talks-in-turkey-to-allow-putin-zelenskyy-meeting
