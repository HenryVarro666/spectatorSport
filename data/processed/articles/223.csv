The United States and Ukraine have been partners since Ukraine declared its independence from the Soviet Union more than 30 years ago. After Russia invaded and partially occupied Ukraine in 2014, the United States intensified efforts to help Ukraine deter further Russian aggression, and, if needed, to defend itself from additional attacks. Last fall, as the present threat against Ukraine from Russia developed, under authority delegated by the President, I authorized the Department of Defense to provide $60 million in immediate military assistance to Ukraine. In December, as that threat materialized, I authorized a further drawdown worth $200 million. Today, as Ukraine fights with courage and pride against Russia’s brutal and unprovoked assault, I have authorized, pursuant to a delegation by the President, an unprecedented third Presidential Drawdown of up to $350 million for immediate support to Ukraine’s defense. This brings the total security assistance the United States has committed to Ukraine over the past year to more than $1 billion.

This package will include further lethal defensive assistance to help Ukraine address the armored, airborne, and other threats it is now facing. It is another clear signal that the United States stands with the people of Ukraine as they defend their sovereign, courageous, and proud nation.",https://www.state.gov/additional-military-assistance-for-ukraine/

Volunteer fighters were seen as national heroes in 2014, when the Russian-backed separatist war began in Donbas and the military was unprepared for the challenges it faced in eastern Ukraine. However, some analysts worried that those volunteer forces posed a threat to domestic governance and security.

In the expanded war with Russia now unfolding, will the government’s call for volunteers pose similar risks? My research finds that extensive changes have helped boost the military’s expertise, improved the government’s ability to control its forces, and limit opportunities for volunteer formations to defy Kyiv’s political authority — all of which suggest Ukraine’s volunteers in 2022 pose less of a risk.

Volunteer battalions didn’t always fall in line

In March 2014, the Ukrainian government called on volunteers to defend the country. Legally, volunteer formations were supposed to operate under the Ministry of Defense (MoD) and the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MoIA). In reality, many independently funded formations had extensive operational and political autonomy, and their own political goals. High levels of motivation and relative independence made these volunteers capable defenders of Ukraine — but also enabled them to challenge the government.

Here are some examples. In February 2015, representatives of 17 battalions initiated the creation of an alternative General Staff, separate from the UAF, to coordinate the actions of the volunteers. In December 2016, the leaders of the “Donbas” and “Aidar” battalions announced an economic blockade of the separatist Donetsk and Luhansk “people’s republics,” something Kyiv had not ordered. Ukraine’s government then had no choice but to adopt the blockade as its official policy.

And in the fall of 2019, the former commander of the “Azov” battalion brought about 100 veteran fighters to Zolote, in Luhansk oblast, to block the president’s decision to begin disengaging troops, in compliance with the Minsk Protocol.

Moves like this raised concerns about the power and intention of Ukraine’s volunteer forces. However, my research indicates that the factors that enabled the battalions to intervene in politics after 2014 are not present today, making the emergence of new challengers unlikely. Here’s what has changed.

Ukraine’s military is ready to tackle the threat

In April 2014, Kyiv identified the threat in eastern Ukraine as “separatism and the use of weapons against your own […] state.” Since dealing with internal threats was beyond the UAF’s expertise, the military was unprepared for the challenge. On April 17, 2014, in Kramatorsk, Donetsk oblast, the 25th Airborne Brigade surrendered to a crowd of local people. The officers and soldiers explained that no one trained them to deal with civilians or fight within the cities. A series of similar events set the stage for volunteer battalions eager to fight the nonuniformed separatists, rather than the military taking the lead.

By contrast, in 2022, a more professionalized UAF has been trained to address a broad range of contingencies related to Russian aggression. The first few days of fighting in Ukraine showed the UAF’s ability to reverse the advancement of Russia’s superior forces, take down aircraft and resist diversionary groups in Ukrainian cities. This closer alignment between the nature of the threat and the redefined UAF’s expertise means that in 2022, the volunteers will assist the military and not replace it.

Kyiv now controls the use of force

Kyiv’s attempts to mobilize troops in the spring of 2014 exposed the government’s inability to control a military that was both highly bureaucratized and not combat-ready. Before 2014, the UAF resembled an extensive bureaucracy more than a capable military. Experts I interviewed in Kyiv noted that the UAF’s expertise was not fighting but managing paperwork, which earned it a pejorative nickname — the Ukrainian Paper Army.

At the time, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said that about 30 percent of the UAF conscripts abandoned their positions as the war in Donbas broke out. Many who remained tried to avoid fighting by reporting their equipment lost in combat — and secretly providing it to the volunteer battalions, against the government’s direct orders. At the outset of the fighting, the lack of civilian control over the military allowed some volunteer battalions to maintain significant autonomy and build a heroic image, in contrast to what many Ukrainians saw as incompetent political elites and an impotent military.

Professionalization of the UAF since 2014 has made it subordinate to Kyiv’s policies. In fall 2019, when battalion veterans tried to prevent the planned disengagement, the UAF worked with law enforcement to overcome volunteers’ opposition. Military experts I interviewed in Kyiv in December 2019 noted that since the start of the Donbas conflict, conscripts and politically motivated volunteers alike had largely been replaced by professional contract soldiers. Having a reliable military allowed President Volodymyr Zelensky to confront the renegade battalions and proceed with his preferred policy option.

Kyiv has also managed to bring most volunteers under civilian control within the MoD and MoIA structures. Most recently, a new law in January declared the president of Ukraine the supreme commander in chief over the volunteers through the MoD and UAF structures in a top-down manner.

So far, the early days of war suggest that this mechanism is working. This improved civilian control over the use of force decreases the chances that volunteers will challenge Ukraine’s democracy and security in the future.

Under the current conditions, Kyiv’s control over a professional and capable military is essential for defending Ukraine from the Russian aggression. It is also essential for mitigating any risks that armed volunteers would become a challenge to Ukraine’s security and democracy in the future.

Gen. Igor Konashenkov claimed Friday that Russian forces staged a ""successful landing operation"" to capture Hostomel airfield on the outskirts of Kyiv.

""More than 200 Russian helicopters were involved in the operation,"" according to the statement. ""The success of the landing was ensured by the suppression of the entire air defense system in the landing area, the complete isolation of the combat area from the air and the active conduct of electronic warfare.""

Konashenkov claimed that Russian forces killed more than 200 of the opposing forces and that there were no casualties among in the Russian Armed Forces.

CNN could not immediately corroborate those claims, but a CNN team on the ground witnessed Russian airborne troops taking positions at the airfield Thursday.

The Russian statement claimed — without evidence — that US military and intelligence advisers have instructed Ukrainian military leaders to place rocket artillery systems in residential areas to provoke return fire on local residents, echoing propaganda claims that the Russian military has made in Syria to counter allegations of civilian casualties caused by Russian strikes.

""I appeal to Ukrainian citizens,"" Konashenkov said. ""Your nationalist leadership uses the same methods as the terrorists. They want to use you as a human shield. The Russian Armed Forces will not inflict any strikes on residential areas of the Ukrainian capital.""

More context: Two residential buildings in Kyiv suffered damage in the early hours of Friday, but it's not clear if they were intentionally struck or hit by debris, or if anyone was injured.

Ukrainian Deputy Interior Minister Evgeny Yenin told CNN a Ukrainian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jet was shot down over Kyiv. Photos tweeted by the emergency forces appear to show a fire at a two-story private house with debris from what appears to be a plane nearby.

When asked by NBC's Lester Holt if Russia could directly threaten NATO countries, Blinken reiterated U.S. commitment to Article Five of NATO's founding treaty. A cornerstone of the 30-member alliance is the principle of collective defense, known as Article 5, which states that an attack on one NATO country is an attack on all allies.

Holt also asked about the new round of White House sanctions that President Joe Biden said would ""exceed anything that's ever been done.""

Blinken responded, ""If President Putin decided to pursue the path of diplomacy and dialogue, we were ready for that and prepared to engage on that, but equally if he pursued the path of aggression, which tragically is exactly what he's done, we're prepared on that too and as a result, we have responded in a united way, swiftly and with real consequence to impose very severe costs on Russia for the aggression it's committing on Ukraine.""

“The next 48 hours will be decisive.”

That’s what OLENA SOTNYK, an adviser to Ukraine's deputy prime minister, told a Twitter Space audience organized by the German Marshall Fund in Washington, D.C., today. NatSec Daily was on the call, and for the first time we heard not just frustration with events — particularly the West’s anemic response to Russia’s war on Ukraine, in her view — but a hint of resignation about her outgunned nation’s prospects in the war.

Should Russia deploy more of its military power, it is “almost not possible” for Ukraine to win, she said in a response to NatSec Daily’s question. “It will be very hard to defend against that,” which is why she called on the United States and its partners to immediately send weapons alongside humanitarian and economic aid. “We are on our territory. That’s why we are telling you we’re ready to fight.”

The Ukrainian resistance has proved more formidable than many — namely those in the Kremlin — initially anticipated. Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense has claimed that its forces killed around 3,000 Russians and took out many of its air and ground assets.

While it's too early to make any large strategic assessments, it's clear the situation grew more dire over the last 24 hours.

Russian troops pushed their way into Kyiv as bullets and explosions rang out in the northern part of the capital. Missiles and rockets continued to pockmark buildings and roads throughout the city. Satellite imagery showed 90 Russian helicopters have lined up in rural Belarus, just under 100 miles away from Kyiv. Ukrainian President VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY released a video on his official Telegram channel to prove he had not fled the country, despite the fact that he is a top target for Russia’s forces.

“Their objective is to encircle the capital, to secure control of the population and change the regime,"" Sir JIM HOCKENHULL, the British chief of defense intelligence, told reporters today.

For the moment, some Ukrainian officials continue to project confidence. “Kyiv is fully under control,” Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S., OKSANA MARKAROVA, said during a press conference today. “We are going to win for sure!” Ukrainian Defense Minister OLEKSII REZNIKOV said in a statement posted to Facebook.

But officials that NatSecDaily and our colleagues spoke with didn’t echo that sentiment.

White House press secretary JEN PSAKI during her Friday news conference said ""Kyiv falling is a real possibility."" Russia has only sent about a third of the troops it amassed outside Ukraine into the country thus far, a senior U.S. defense official said, implying that there’s much more Russian President VLADIMIR PUTIN can throw at the Ukrainians. A European official told us to expect the “rapid” fall of the capital and alluded to a situation where Ukraine could split in a manner reminiscent of Yugoslavia’s dissolution

Asked specifically if Kyiv would hold, NATO Secretary General JENS STOLTENBERG declined to answer except to say, ""I will pay my respect to the Ukrainian armed forces, which are really proving their bravery and their courage by fighting and standing up against the much larger invading Russian force."" He did, however, announce that alliance members will send more air-defense assets and weapons to Ukraine and that elements of the NATO Response Force would soon deploy to the bloc’s eastern front.

But even that is too little, too late for Sotnyk. She was asking — pleading — for the West to send more materiel, help impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine and cut off Russia from the global financial system.

If all of that doesn’t happen within the next two days, Sotnyk fears the country she loves and is fighting for could fall into Putin’s hands. “Ukraine is now a test for the whole world,” she said. “We have not too much time.”

PUTIN CALLS FOR REGIME CHANGE IN UKRAINE: For a brief moment it looked like the leaders of Russia and Ukraine might negotiate an end to this war — before Putin told the world his real ambition.

Zelenskyy offered to “sit at the negotiating table to stop the death of people” during a late-night address. But Putin responded by calling on Ukraine’s military to overthrow the Ukrainian government before engaging in any talks.

“Take power into your own hands,” Putin said in an opening video statement. It would be easier for Russia “to come to an agreement than with this gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis, who occupied Kyiv and took the entire Ukrainian people hostage.” To be explicit, that was Putin openly and brazenly calling for regime change in Ukraine.

SERGEY LAVROV, Russia’s longtime foreign minister, weighed in by saying Moscow won’t talk to Kyiv until Zelenskyy’s administration surrenders.

The Guardian’s ANDREW ROTH surmised, claiming that Ukrainian forces deposed the government in Kyiv “may be how [Putin] explains Zelensky’s eventual overthrow, if Russia achieves its goals.” A spokesperson for Zelenskyy told reporters that Kyiv and Moscow are discussing where and how to hold talks. Earlier in the day, Zelenskyy appealed to Israel to both host and mediate a potential discussion.



U.S. AND EU FREEZE PUTIN AND LAVROV’S ASSETS: In a symbolic but no-less-serious move, the U.S. joined the European Union in freezing Putin and Lavrov’s assets but didn’t ban them from traveling to and within the bloc.

""In alignment with the decision by our European allies, the United States will join them in sanctioning President Putin and Foreign Minister Lavrov and members of the Russian national security team,” Psaki said. The White House said further details on the sanctions would be forthcoming.

""This is an important step,"" the EU’s foreign affairs chief JOSEP BORRELL said in brief remarks, noting that the only other world leaders under similar sanctions are BASHAR ASSAD in Syria and ALEXANDER LUKASHENKO in Belarus.

That won’t be enough to placate the Ukrainians, though, who are calling for the West to kick Russia out of SWIFT and impose even harder penalties on the country.

U.S. URGED CHINA TO STOP RUSSIA: The Biden administration held multiple meetings with Chinese officials urging them to pressure Russia into pulling back from invading Ukraine, The New York Times’ EDWARD WONG reported.

“Each time, the Chinese officials, including the foreign minister and the ambassador to the United States, rebuffed the Americans, saying they did not think an invasion was in the works. After one diplomatic exchange in December, U.S. officials got intelligence showing Beijing had shared the information with Moscow, telling the Russians that the United States was trying to sow discord — and that China would not try to impede Russian plans and actions, the officials said,” Wong wrote.

With Russia increasingly cut off from the Western world, Beijing has turned into more of a lifeline for Moscow. China has tried to walk a fine line between neither showing support for, nor inclination against, Putin’s war on Ukraine. In a call reported by Chinese state-run media, Chinese leader XI JINPING told Putin that the Russian should seek a negotiated end to the fighting.

However, China can’t replace what Russia will lose from its severed economic ties to the West, namely the number of semiconductors that will no longer flow into Russia. And there are already reports of Chinese state banks restricting financing for Russian commodities.

Still, China had a choice to speak loudly and openly against a Russian invasion of Ukraine. It didn’t.

BIDEN ADMIN DEBATES ARMING UKRAINE: Foreign Policy’s JACK DETSCH and ROBBIE GRAMER report on a Biden administration fight over whether to further arm Ukraine now that the war with Russia has begun.

“The administration’s internal debate, described by three officials and congressional aides, has heated up, with some officials expressing caution that arming Ukrainian resistance could make the United States legally a co-combatant to a wider war with Russia and escalate tensions between the two nuclear powers,” they wrote. “The debate partly centers on the legal basis of a U.S. president’s war power authorities and underscores how concerned U.S. national security planners are that Ukraine’s government could swiftly fall.”

If Russia attempts to overthrow Kyiv, which Putin all but said, “some aides on Capitol Hill believe Biden should seek approval from Congress before sending weapons and other military aid to Ukrainian forces. Some international law experts believe that delivering such arms during an active war could allow Russia to make the case that the United States is legally a party to the conflict.”

On Tuesday, we reported on a bipartisan effort to push Biden to seek congressional approval for sending troops to Ukraine, which the president to date has repeatedly taken off the table.

SPORTS AND ENTERTAINMENT WORLD OSTRACIZES RUSSIA: Formula 1 won’t hold the Russian Grand Prix. The Champions League final, one of world soccer’s premier events, won’t take place in St. Petersburg, Putin’s hometown. And a Russian contestant won’t participate at the next Eurovision Song Contest.

These are major money-making and prestige-giving events. Russia’s ban from hosting them, or participating in them, will isolate Moscow from global culture along with the global community.

Authoritarian regimes like using popular events — say, the Olympics — to bolster and whitewash their reputations. Russia won’t soon get the chance to rebuild its image in the eyes of the world.



Keystrokes

UKRAINE HAS FENDED OFF WORST CYBER PREDICTIONS: Two days into Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the besieged nation seems to have escaped some of the more damaging cyberattacks predicted by officials, such as turning out the lights and cutting other essential services. But there could be a more practical and malicious reason that Moscow has so far avoided unleashing the full extent of its cyber capabilities, our own MAGGIE MILLER writes in.

“Usually Russian doctrine is to go after telecom, electricity and government services as a precursor to an invasion,” said JAMES LEWIS, the director of the Strategic Technologies Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “I’m a little surprised, normally they would do something, but the bad news is you don’t attack peoples’ electrical grid if you think you’re going to own it in a few days.”

The decision not to disrupt power grids, pipelines and other critical infrastructure could also be a decision not to unduly disrupt the lives of Ukrainian civilians in the event of a long Russian occupation. MARK MONTGOMERY, senior director at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said that while Russia may not care as much about fixing systems, keeping the lights on could help them stay in control of Ukraine.

“I imagine they are not that interested in permanently damaging electrical power grids,” Montgomery said. “If you break it you’ve got to fix it, but if they break it they have got to occupy it and that is going to create a problem for them and make them even less popular with the Ukrainian citizenry.”

While critical infrastructure has mostly been spared by hackers so far, Ukraine has not been immune against attacks. Massive distributed denial of service attacks were launched twice in the last week against Ukrainian government and banking websites, with the Biden administration blaming the first attack on Russian government hackers. Ukraine’s Computer Emergency Response Team warned in a Facebook post Friday that a Belarus-based hacking group known as “UNC1151” is carrying out a campaign to target Ukrainian military personnel and related individuals with malicious phishing emails.

Given the previous attacks, there is still a high likelihood that Ukraine will see some level of cyberattacks on critical infrastructure.

“I don’t think their intent is to destroy infrastructure, but rather to disrupt it while they maneuver their forces,” Montgomery said.



The Complex

LCS SETBACK: Our friends at Morning Defense (for Pros!) note that the Littoral Combat Ship just received some even more bad news — a damning report by the Government Accountability Office.

The fleet of coastal vessels, built by Lockheed Martin and Austal USA, “has not demonstrated the operational capabilities it needs to perform its mission,” GAO concluded. “Operational testing has found several significant challenges, including the ship’s ability to defend itself if attacked and failure rates of mission-essential equipment.”

The vessels are considered central to the Navy’s vision for a larger fleet. “LCS is in that mix,” Chief of Naval Operations Adm. MIKE GILDAY said last week in sketching out his vision for a 500-ship Navy.

The congressional auditors said the Navy has pursued most of the recommendations they have made over the years to try to salvage LCS. But lingering challenges remain on maintaining the ships, including “how to obtain technical data” needed to keep the vessels operating.

AIA MIA?: Major defense contractors like Boeing, Lockheed Martin and BAE Systems are withholding their annual dues from the Aerospace Industries Association “over what they consider a lack of leadership from ERIC FANNING, the group’s CEO and president,” our own LEE HUDSON and DANIEL LIPPMAN wrote based on emails they obtained.

“In a February email to AIA Chief Operating Officer PETER PROWITT, representatives from the three companies wrote that they were not receiving an adequate return on investment from the trade association to tackle industry-wide problems, and instead are relying on other groups such as the National Defense Industrial Association and Professional Services Council to better represent their interests,” the two reported. Three industry officials Hudson and Lippman spoke to “claim that Fanning hasn’t effectively voiced concerns on behalf of industry to members of the Congress and the administration.”

An AIA spokesperson said in a statement: “AIA has a strong track record of meeting the priorities of our industry CEOs who set our strategy,” adding “whether it is one company or a handful of members, we are committed to addressing and resolving their questions or concerns when they arise.""



On the Hill

EYES ON UKRAINE AID: Congress is gearing up to provide more funding to help Ukraine's military fend off the Russian invasion, but it may be too late for any new cash to make a difference, our colleagues ANDREW DESIDERIO, CONNOR O'BRIEN and JENNIFER SCHOLTES report.

Biden hasn't formally requested more money to respond to the crisis yet, but Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill have vowed to craft supplemental funding legislation that bolsters Ukraine and countries on NATO's eastern edge. That effort, which comes as lawmakers also aim to wrap up a full-year funding package for the Pentagon, could amount to billions in new funding.

""If we are not doing everything possible, we are not doing enough,"" said Sen. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-S.C.), who said he told the administration an emergency spending bill would win bipartisan support. ""Time is not on our side.""

Some lawmakers are skeptical more weapons will tip the balance as Russian forces close in on Kyiv. Furnishing the Ukrainian military with more weapons and equipment may only go so far, House Armed Services Chair ADAM SMITH (D-Wash.) cautioned.

“I don’t think it’s realistic to think that we’re going to be able to reinforce them enough in the short-term to repel the invasion,” Smith said Thursday on CNN. “We do need to try and help them as much as possible, and it is quite possible that what we’re looking at here is a more long-term insurgency.”

Sen. CHRIS COONS (D-Del.) — a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and chair of the Appropriations subcommittee that controls diplomatic funding and foreign assistance programs — predicts a supplemental would likely exceed $10 billion, with most of the emergency cash going toward humanitarian efforts to address an impending refugee crisis in Europe.



WHO WILL REPLACE INHOFE? Morning Defense also wrote about the race to take over retiring Oklahoma Sen. JIM INHOFE’s place as the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee.

Inhofe’s decision “puts Sen. ROGER WICKER of Mississippi, a leading shipbuilding advocate, in the pole position to become the next ranking member of the SASC — and possibly chair. If he’s not the one, the new top R could be nuclear enterprise champion Sen. DEB FISCHER” of Nebraska.

“If Wicker gets the job, expect him to continue his push to expand the size of the Navy.

Mississippi is home to shipyards that build destroyers and amphibious ships and he has backed the Navy's yearslong goal of reaching over 355 hulls,” Morning D wrote. If it’s not Wicker, “the post would likely fall to Fischer, who would be the first woman to chair the panel.

Fischer has her own parochial defense interests. Nebraska hosts the headquarters of U.S. Strategic Command, which oversees U.S. nuclear weapons. She supports overhauling the arsenal and maintaining the land-based ICBMs and has opposed changes in U.S. nuclear policy, such as declaring a no-first use policy.”

The 87-year-old Inhofe will announce his retirement next week but will stay in his seat until the end of the year.



Broadsides

SASSE WANTS INTEL SHARED WITH UKRAINE: Sen. BEN SASSE (R-Neb.), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Friday on MSNBC’s ""Morning Joe"" that the U.S. should send “tactical, actionable intelligence to the Ukrainians on the ground so they can kill the Russian invaders.”

“We need to be arming them to the teeth,” Sasse also recommended, urging Biden to ask Congress for emergency supplemental defense spending and cut off Russia’s access to the SWIFT banking system.

It’s clear he’s pushing the administration to do more, but it’s not a partisan point at this moment since Democrats are saying the same things.

“As we seek to impose maximum costs on Putin, there is more that we can and should do. Congress and the Biden administration must not shy away from any options — including sanctioning the Russian Central Bank, removing Russian banks from the SWIFT payment system, crippling Russia’s key industries, sanctioning Putin personally, and taking all steps to deprive Putin and his inner circle of their assets,” Sen. BOB MENENDEZ (D-N.J.), chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement yesterday.

6,0a87e12f-f1df-4f04-8278-eabde77b47d0,[],,"US President Joe Biden will nominate federal appeals court Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court, according to a person familiar with the matter, making her the first Black woman selected to serve on a court that once declared her race unworthy of citizenship and endorsed segregation.

In Jackson, Biden delivers on a campaign promise to make the historic appointment and to further diversify a court that was made up entirely of white men for almost two centuries. He has chosen an attorney who would be the high court’s first former public defender, though she also possesses the elite legal background of other justices.

Jackson would be the current court’s second Black justice — Justice Clarence Thomas, a conservative, is the other — and just the third in history.

The news was confirmed by a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss it before the president’s official announcement later today.

She would also be only the sixth woman to serve on the court, and her confirmation would mean that for the first time four women would sit together on the nine-member court.

The current court includes three women, one of whom is the court’s first Latina, Justice Sonia Sotomayor.

Jackson would join the liberal minority of a conservative-dominated court that is weighing cutbacks to abortion rights and will be considering ending affirmative action in college admissions and restricting voting rights efforts to increase minority representation.

Biden is filling the seat that will be vacated by Justice Stephen Breyer, 83, who is retiring at the end of the term this summer.

Jackson, 51, once worked as one of Breyer’s law clerks early in her legal career. She attended Harvard as an undergraduate and for law school, and served on the US Sentencing Commission, the agency that develops federal sentencing policy, before becoming a federal judge in 2013.

Her nomination is subject to confirmation by the Senate, where Democrats hold the majority by a razor-thin 50-50 margin with Vice President Kamala Harris as the tie-breaker. Party leaders have promised swift but deliberate consideration of the president’s nominee.

The next justice will replace one of the more liberal justices, so she would not tip the balance of the court, which now leans 6-3 in favor of conservatives.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-february-25-2022/
