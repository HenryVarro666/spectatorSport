19 Mar 2022 00.42 Years of tension between Moscow and US-based Facebook and Twitter erupted into confrontation after the invasion of Ukraine, with the platforms targeting state-tied media and then finding themselves restricted in Russia, reports Associated Press.

How likely is Russia to block chat platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram? Here’s some analysis from AP.

Messaging apps have gotten a pass so far in part because Meta-owned WhatsApp is less suited for mass communication, while Telegram’s ability to blast information to large groups has made it useful both for independent media and the Kremlin. “I think it’s unlikely Russia will ban Telegram because they are so short on platforms where they can operate,” said Sergey Sanovich, a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University, who noted that authorities in 2020 aborted efforts to block the service. Telegram, criticized as having a lax content policing policy, offers a forum for Russian authorities to promote narratives friendly to their internationally condemned war. Russia still operates accounts on platforms like Facebook, despite blocking the service at home, but this week the Silicon Valley giant took down posts from Moscow’s pages that contained misinformation about its deadly offensive. Telegram has become an essential exchange for news on the war, with its growth accelerating after the Kremlin’s latest crackdown on independent media and the lock-out of apps like Facebook and Instagram. An average of 2.5 million new users joined Telegram daily in the last three weeks, the firm said, about a 25 percent jump from the weeks prior. But experts highlighted a risk to Telegram and its users due to a lack of default, end-to-end encryption that potentially leaves the company susceptible to government pressure to turn over information. Alp Toker, director of web monitoring group NetBlocks, noted WhatsApp has put in place firestops that offer insulation against that sort of pressure. “By improving their security and adopting end-to-end encryption technology, they have essentially protected their own platform from legal risk and potential demands for content access requests,” Toker added. WhatsApp’s use for one-on-one or group chats make it less of a target for Russian authorities for now, but that could change if it became known as a key platform for protests against the war.



19 Mar 2022 23.32 Zelenskiy video address - key points In the early hours of Saturday, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy released a video address in which he told Moscow that now was the time for urgent peace talks, warning that Russian losses will otherwise be so huge it will take generations to recover. Here are some of the key points from his speech: Russia has continued to block the supply of aid to besieged cities “in most areas”

Zelenskiy said that on Friday there were seven humanitarian corridors in Ukraine. Six in the Sumy region, one in the Donetsk region.

More than 9,000 people were evacuated from the besieged Mariupol, he said, and hundreds of tons of essential products were delivered. But he added: “The occupiers continue to block the supply of humanitarian aid to the besieged cities in most areas. This is a totally deliberate tactic. They have a clear order to do absolutely everything to make the humanitarian catastrophe in Ukrainian cities an ‘argument’ for Ukrainians to cooperate with the occupiers. This is a war crime.” No new information on fatalities following a Russian airstrike on a theatre in Mariupol

Zelenskiy said people were being rescued from the rubble, and that more than 130 people had been rescued so far. “Some of them are seriously wounded. But at the moment there is no information about the dead,” he said. Hundreds of civilians were sheltering in the theatre.

He thanked those defending Mariupol, saying the city was experiencing “the greatest ordeal in its history, in the history of Ukraine.” Russian forces had been stopped “in almost all directions”

Zelenskiy said Russian forces were halted across many areas of the country. He said there was heavy fighting in the Kharkiv region, especially near Izyum, but that Russian troops were unprepared.

(There is more analysis on the state of the conflict, from Institute of the Study of War, in an earlier post) “Meaningful, fair” negotiations were urgently needed.

Zelenskiy told Moscow: “It’s time to meet. Time to talk. It is time to restore territorial integrity and justice for Ukraine. Otherwise Russia’s losses will be so huge that several generations will not be enough to rebound.” He said: “Negotiations on peace, on security for us, for Ukraine - meaningful, fair and without delay - are the only chance for Russia to reduce the damage from its own mistakes.” On the international response:

Zelenskiy said he would continue to appeal to world leaders to call for peace in Ukraine, with plans to address Switzerland, Italy, Israel and Japan. He has spoken with Ukrainian ambassadors around the world “to intensify the supply of humanitarian goods” for displaced people in Ukraine. A coordination headquarters has also been set up to oversee the delivery of humanitarian aid to Ukraine, he said.

19 Mar 2022 23.07 Ukraine’s defence ministry said late on Friday it lost access to the Sea of Azov “temporarily” as invading Russian forces were tightening their grip around the Sea’s major port of Mariupol, Reuters reports.

More from Reuters: “The occupiers have partially succeeded in the Donetsk operational district, temporarily depriving Ukraine of access to the Sea of Azov,” Ukraine’s defence ministry said in a statement.



The ministry did not specify in its statement whether Ukraine’s forces have regained access to the Sea.



Russia said on Friday its forces were “tightening the noose” around Mariupol, where an estimated 80% of the city’s homes had been damaged more some 1,000 people may still be trapped in makeshift bomb shelters beneath a destroyed theatre.



Mariupol, with its strategic location on the coast of the Sea of Azov, has been a target since the start of the war on Feb. 24 when Russian President Vladimir Putin launched what he called a “special military operation”.



The city lies on the route between the Russian-annexed peninsula of Crimea to the west, and the Donetsk region to the east, which is partially controlled by pro-Russian separatists.



Russia claimed as early as March 1 that its forces had cut off the Ukrainian military from the Sea of Azov.



19 Mar 2022 22.41 Three Russian cosmonauts arrived at the International Space Station on Friday wearing yellow flight suits with blue accents, colours that appeared to match the Ukrainian flag, Associated Press reports.



Here is some further detail from AP: The men were the first new arrivals on the space station since the start of the Russian war in Ukraine last month.



Russian space corporation Roscosmos cosmonauts Oleg Artemyev, Denis Matveyev and Sergey Korsakov blasted off successfully from the Russia-leased Baikonur launch facility in Kazakhstan in their Soyuz MS-21 spacecraft at 8:55 p.m. Friday (11:55 a.m. EDT). They smoothly docked at the station just over three hours later, joining two Russians, four Americans and a German on the orbiting outpost.



Video of Artemyev taken as the spacecraft prepared to dock with the space station showed him wearing a blue flight suit. It was unclear what, if any, message the yellow uniforms they changed into were intended to send.



When the cosmonauts were able to talk to family back on Earth, Artemyev was asked about the suits. He said every crew chooses their own.

“It became our turn to pick a colour. But in fact, we had accumulated a lot of yellow material so we needed to use it. So that’s why we had to wear yellow,” he said.



Since the war started, many people have used the Ukrainian flag and its colours to show solidarity with the country.



The war has resulted in canceled spacecraft launches and broken contracts.



19 Mar 2022 21.53 Samantha Power, who leads the US Agency for International Development (USAid), has said Ukraine and Moldova have successfully synchronised with the European electric grid, stabilising power supplies.

Ukraine & Moldova have successfully synchronized w/ the European electric grid. This move will improve the stability of electric power to critical facilities amidst continuing war. @USAID supported this effort for years; grateful that Europe agreed to accelerate this process. — Samantha Power (@PowerUSAID) March 19, 2022 The development was announced by the European Commission earlier this week, which said the work would keep “homes warm and lights on during these dark times.”



19 Mar 2022 21.32 Ukrainian forces conducted a major successful counterattack around Mykolayiv, in southern Ukraine, over the past several days, according to the Institute of the Study of War, a US thinktank tracking the fighting. In a recent update, ISW said that Russian forces continued to secure territorial gains only around Mariupol on Friday and that Russian forces face growing morale and supply problems. This includes growing reports of self-mutilation among Russian troops to avoid deployment to Ukraine and shortages of key guided munitions.

The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces “continue step by step to liberate the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine in all directions” on Friday, the first Ukrainian mention of conducting counterattacks “in all directions”, according to ISW. #Russian forces face growing morale and supply problems, including growing reports of self-mutilation among Russian troops to avoid deployment to #Ukraine and shortages of key guided munitions.

19 Mar 2022 21.23 Belgium on Friday delayed by a decade a plan to scrap nuclear energy in 2025, spooked by the huge rise in energy prices due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, reports AFP.

Here is some more detail from AFP’s report:

The push to 2035 comes as calls are rising that neighbouring Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, should also rethink its nuclear energy exit, but ministers in Berlin last week doubled down on their country’s no atom pledge despite the price shock. Europe is scrambling to find ways to wean itself off its energy dependency on Russia, which provides 40% of Europe’s gas needs, mainly to Germany, Italy and several central European countries. Prices have skyrocketed for Europeans since the invasion by Russia of Ukraine and EU leaders will meet next week to agree on fresh emergency measures to soften the blow for consumers and businesses.



19 Mar 2022 20.59 A US military aircraft with four people on board has crashed in northern Norway, reports Reuters.



The MV-22B Osprey aircraft belonging to the US Marine Corps was taking part in a NATO military exercise called Cold Response when it was reported missing at 1826 CET (1726 GMT), according to Norway’s Joint Rescue Coordination Centres (JRCC).

Here is some more detail from Reuters:

A rescue helicopter and a Norwegian military Orion plane searching the area spotted the wreckage from the air at 2017 GMT after receiving an emergency signal.

“We’ve discovered an aircraft that has crashed. We’ve seen no sign of life,” Nordland police chief of staff Bent Eilertsen told Reuters.

“We’ve been told it’s an American aircraft with four Americans on board,” he said.

Because of the bad weather, the rescue aircraft could not land. Instead, police and rescue services were trying to reach the site by land, but it was unclear how long this could take.

“It’s dark, the weather conditions are bad and there is a risk of avalanches,” Eilertsen said.

The plane was on a training exercise and had been due to land at around 1800 CET (1700 GMT). Weather was bad in the area, with conditions worsening.





19 Mar 2022 20.53 Two former US presidents, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, showed their support for Ukraine on Friday, by placing bouquets of sunflowers, the country’s national emblem, outside a church in Chicago.

They wore blue and yellow ribbons in the colours of Ukraine’s flag, and placed the flowers in front of the Catholic Church of Saints Volodymyr and Olha. America stands united with the people of Ukraine in their fight for freedom and against oppression. pic.twitter.com/O7INc9S1tq — Bill Clinton (@BillClinton) March 18, 2022 A video of the gesture was shared on Clinton’s Twitter account, alongside a post that said: “America stands united with the people of Ukraine in their fight for freedom and against oppression.”

It sets the former presidents apart from Donald Trump, writes AFP. It reports: “[Trump] just before the invasion described Vladimir Putin’s strategy of amassing troops on Russia’s border with Ukraine and then recognizing the independence of two pro-Russian separatist territories as a stroke of ‘genius.’”





19 Mar 2022 20.36 Tess McClure As Russia’s devastating war on Ukraine drags on, the question of whether to keep buying and selling Russian diamonds is a quandary for jewellers, diamond companies and the industry bodies set up to regulate them – many of which depend on the country’s state-controlled diamond sector for supply.



Industry insiders say US sanctions will do little or nothing to stop the flow of diamonds from Alrosa, Russia’s enormous state-backed mining monopoly, to the west.

19 Mar 2022 20.33 It is time for meaningful talks with Moscow, says Zelenskiy Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has released a video address saying the time has come for peace talks, warning it will otherwise take generations for Russia to recover from losses suffered during the war. Reuters has released the following summary of his speech: Zelenskiy said Ukraine had always offered solutions for peace and wanted meaningful and honest negotiations on peace and security, without delay.

“I want everyone to hear me now, especially in Moscow. The time has come for a meeting, it is time to talk,” he said in a video address released in the early hours of Saturday.

“The time has come to restore territorial integrity and justice for Ukraine. Otherwise, Russia’s losses will be such that it will take you several generations to recover.”

The two sides have been involved in talks for weeks with no sign of a breakthrough.

Zelenskiy said Russian forces were deliberately blocking the supply of humanitarian supplies to cities under attack.

“This is a deliberate tactic ... This is a war crime and they will answer for it, 100%,” he said.

Zelenskiy said there was no information about how many people had died after a theatre in the city of Mariupol, where hundreds of people had been sheltering, was struck on Wednesday. More than 130 people had been rescued so far, he said.



19 Mar 2022 20.16 A teenager was overwhelmed when Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy shook her hand and gave her flowers during a visit to people wounded by Russian attacks at a Kyiv hospital on Thursday. Sixteen-year-old Katya Vlasenko, who was wounded when the car her family was travelling in came under fire, told the president he was a hero on social media platform TikTok, to which Zelenskiy responded: “Oh yes? So we have occupied TikTok?” Katya’s family was trying to escape fighting in the area north-west of the capital Kyiv when their car came under fire near Hostomel. 0 Hospitalised teen becomes emotional meeting Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy – video It’s Rebecca Ratcliffe here in Bangkok, I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments on the war in Ukraine today.

War in Ukraine: The bombing continues, Biden warns China against helping Russia

French President Emmanuel Macron said he was “extremely concerned” over the fate of Ukraine's city of Mariupol during a lengthy phone call Friday with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin. Earlier, US President Joe Biden spoke to China's Xi Jinping in which Biden aimed to persuade Xi to join Western pressure on Russia, the White House said. The high-stakes calls took place as Russia expanded its offensive and the war entered its fourth week.",https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20220318-live-ukraine-updates-western-leaders-accuse-russia-of-war-crimes-as-civilian-toll-mounts
8,1159321e-65f4-4a64-af4e-6db76d5db24a,"['Farhan Mujahid Chak', 'Farhan Mujahid Chak Is An Associate Professor Of International Affairs At Qatar University.']",2022-03-19 00:00:00,"As the Russian invasion of Ukraine enters its fourth week, we routinely hear words like “evil,” “unhinged” and “unstable” being used to describe Vladimir Putin. Such labelling is not uncommon in realpolitik. It is a tactic in the ever-present rivalries of international politics – to demonise, caricature and demoralise political opponents, while simultaneously reassuring those on your own ideological flank. After all, who wants to be on the side of a lunatic?

Whether it’s describing Saddam Hussein as a “madman,” Gaddafi as “insane,” or Putin as a “megalomaniac,” such caricatures serve broader political objectives by simplifying any conflict into a clear binary of “good” versus “evil”.

The Israeli state often indulges in such framing to delegitimise Palestinians – even questioning their intelligence, by repeating ad nauseum the trope that they “never lose an opportunity to lose an opportunity”. Likewise, apologists for the occupation, militarisation and colonisation of Kashmir in India designate Kashmiris demanding fulfilment of UN Security Council resolutions as “terrorists,” “secessionists” or “anti-nationals.”

Such framing is now being tactfully employed to explain away the Russian invasion of Ukraine – a manipulative discourse construction that facilitates a fog of war.

Of course, the Russian invasion of Ukraine is a monstrosity. As morally repugnant as the war crimes in Syria, brutal dispossession of Palestinians or militarised occupation of Kashmir. Yet, simplistic framings that deem Putin a “madman” without a purpose inhibit our ability to see the bigger picture and do something to prevent further violence.

In other words, now that the war is here, we should ignore all attempts to frame it merely as a showdown between “good” and “evil”, and focus instead on figuring out what steps may be taken not only to end it, but also to prevent it from causing flare-ups in other hotspots across the globe – and possibly triggering another world war.

Putin’s invasion of Ukraine – regardless of its rationality or purpose – will inevitably have an impact on three contentious issues: the war in Syria, the Iran nuclear deal and the US-China rivalry.

First and foremost, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will have consequences for Syria. The impact of sanctions on its economy may cause Russia to pull money and military forces from Syria. An embattled and isolated Putin may also decide to double down on his efforts to turn Syria into a satellite state akin to Belarus. In either scenario, the US may respond by starting to funnel resources to the Syrian resistance.

For some time now, Syrian opposition figures have been working to revive their decade-old campaign against al-Assad. In early February, for example, they came together at a major meeting in Doha, Qatar and vowed to “reunite”. And after the beginning of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, they were very quick to forcefully condemn Putin’s move. Meanwhile, al-Assad is said to have sent scores of fighters to Ukraine to assist Russia’s military intervention. All in all, there is much reason to suspect the events in Ukraine may trigger a flare-up in Syria’s relatively dormant conflict.

Therefore, as the world watches the developments in Ukraine, it should also keep one eye on Syria – to ensure the war in Europe does not translate into more suffering for the people of Syria and more insecurity across the Middle East.

Second, the Russian invasion of Ukraine put the negotiations for a new nuclear deal between the West and Iran into overdrive. US President Biden is now more desperate than ever before to secure a new deal with Iran, curb its nuclear programme, and most importantly, put Iranian oil back on the market amid an energy crisis exacerbated by the Ukraine invasion.

Just days ago, the future of the deal was in serious jeopardy after Russia reportedly said that it would block any deal that would not include guarantees that Western sanctions on Russia over Ukraine would not impede its future dealings with Iran.

On March 15, however, Moscow announced that it received written guarantees from Washington, signalling that the deal may, in fact, soon be completed. For its part, Iran said it is acting as a “strong, independent party” in the negotiations and has Russia’s full support. While these are somewhat promising developments for the future of the region, it is still less than certain that an isolated Russia crippled by sanctions would allow the deal to go forward and Iranian oil to re-enter global markets. The world should keep its eyes firmly on the Iranian front, as if Russia’s Ukraine invasion leads to the demise of the nuclear deal, it would signal more insecurity and conflict for the Gulf and the wider region.

Third, Russia’s war in Ukraine will likely have a major impact on the US-China rivalry. For now, China appears well positioned to gain from Russia’s aggression in Ukraine on multiple fronts, which can cause the US to assume a more combative posture against its arch rival.

Indeed, Beijing can now not only provide an economic lifeline to Russia, and thus make Moscow much more dependent on itself, but also take advantage of the new dynamics that put the US on the back foot to further its interests in other areas. Some analysts, for example, raised concerns that China may unilaterally act vis a vis Taiwan, after witnessing “the West’s weak-kneed response in Ukraine”. While a Ukraine-style Taiwan invasion is unlikely for various reasons, China may assume a more aggressive posture on other fronts if the US continues to imply Chinese responsibility in Russia’s actions.

The emboldening of China, and the US’s reaction to it, may also lead to further escalations in the Indo-Pacific region. The US has been using its ally India as a strategic bulwark against China for too long, and any new global power play involving China, Russia and the US may result in renewed conflict in regional hot-points, such as Kashmir. India’s attempts to resist aligning itself against Russia in the aftermath of the Ukraine invasion already upset its Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QSD) allies. The US and other parties to the dialogue (Australia and Japan) may now demand India to assume a tougher stance if not against Russia, then at least against China. All this may further heighten tensions in the region and lead to violence.

All in all, there are indications that Russia’s war in Ukraine may heighten tensions in various conflict zones, trigger new confrontations, and put the entire planet on a trajectory towards further violence.

Now, therefore, is not the time to complain about what an “evil madman” Putin is, or how “irrational” his actions in Ukraine are. It is not the time to invest in narratives that firmly frame our side as “good” and the other as “evil”. It is time to emphasise de-escalation, intensify confidence-building mechanisms, invest in peace-building and collectively work towards a global armistice with the help and guidance of multilateral organisations. The alternative could be deadly for us all.
