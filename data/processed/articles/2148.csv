THURSDAY, APRIL 14, 2022

Two Ukrainian Neptune missiles struck the Russian missile cruiser Moskva, which later sank, according to a senior U.S. Defense official who was not authorized to speak publicly. The cruiser is believed to be about between 60 and 65 nautical miles south of Odesa and almost exactly due south.

Pentagon officials had previously said they could not confirm the Ukrainian claim of responsibility for an attack that caused the damage, but they did not refute it. Russia initially denied a report that the Moskva, flagship of its Black Sea fleet, sank. The cruiser usually has about 500 officers and crew.

The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation later claimed that the warship sank under tow in stormy conditions due to damage to the hull received due to a fire from the detonation of ammunition, according to Tass, Russia's state news agency.

“The ship was seriously damaged. The crew was completely evacuated,” the ministry added.

The ministry said the fire had been contained and that the ship would be towed to port with its guided missile launchers intact.

MONDAY APRIL 4, 2022

Maxar satellite imagery shows a mass grave estimated to be 45 feet in length in Bucha, Ukraine. According to Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, 280 people were buried on the grounds of the church of St. Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints.

Russia accuses Ukraine of attacking oil depot with helicopters

FRIDAY, APRIL 1, 2022

Russia on Friday accused Ukraine of attacking a fuel depot in Belgorod, which would be the first Ukrainian air strike on Russian soil if confirmed. Vyacheslav Gladkov, regional governor of Belgorod, wrote on Telegram on Friday that two Ukrainian helicopters conducted an air strike late Thursday on the oil facility, which is about 20 miles from Russia’s border with Ukraine.

Kyiv has denied involvement in the attack. ""For some reason they say that we did it, but according to our information this does not correspond to reality,"" Ukraine's Security Council Secretary Oleksiy Danilov said on Ukrainian television.

Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba previously said he could neither confirm nor deny reports of Ukrainian involvement because he was not privy to all military information.

Millions of Ukrainian refugees flee from western border

TUESDAY, MARCH 8, 2022

The number of refugees reached 2 million on Tuesday, according to the United Nations, the fastest exodus Europe has seen since World War II. One million were children, UNICEF spokesman James Elder tweeted, calling it “a dark historical first.” Most others were women.

A decree by Ukraine’s government that prohibits men aged 18 to 60 from leaving the country means that most of those fleeing are women and children, though the U.N. doesn't have exact numbers on gender. Ukraine's policy is meant to encourage men to sign up to fight against Russia’s invasion or to keep them available for military conscription.

Ukraine calls Russian humanitarian corridors proposal ""unacceptable""

MONDAY, MARCH 7, 2022

Russia had promised a cease-fire to allow safe passage for evacuees from the capital of Kyiv, the southern port city of Mariupol, and the cities of Kharkiv and Sumy. Some of the evacuation routes, however, would funnel civilians toward Russia or its ally Belarus, a plan that Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Irina Vereshchuk called unacceptable. U.K. Europe Minister James Cleverly agreed, saying that ""evacuation routes into the arms of the country that is currently destroying yours is nonsense.”

Shell ignites fire as Russians capture nuclear plant

FRIDAY, MARCH 4, 2022

Russian troops seized Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe, early Friday with shelling that hit the plant and ignited a fire, causing fears of a nuclear disaster. However, the shell hit a training center that is ""not part of the reactor,"" said a U.N. official. The fire was extinguished and it appeared there was no radiation leak. The plant's Ukrainian staff is in control of the reactor, but Ukrainian officials said Russian troops control the overall site. Only one reactor is operating at around 60% capacity.

Kherson reportedly captured by Russian troops

THURSDAY, MARCH 3, 2022

Russian forces have reportedly seized Kherson, a key Ukrainian port city on the Black Sea. Igor Kolykhaev, the mayor, said Thursday that troops had occupied the city council building and imposed curfews, but the Ukrainian defense ministry denied the city was under Russian authority. Control of the city, with a population of about 280,000, could allow the Russian military to establish a base of operations for moving farther into Ukraine.

U.S. closes airspace to Russia

Europe, Canada and the U.S. have closed their airspace to Russian airlines following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The airspace restrictions have led to canceled flights, while others planes have been forced to turn around. The restrictions will likely add flight time and, in turn, increase fuel costs. Cargo carrier FedEx said on Feb. 27 that it has temporarily suspended flights to Russia.

Battle for Kharkiv continues as Russian rocket strikes hit civilian areas

In Kharkiv, at least 11 people were killed and 35 wounded in the rocket strike, Interior Ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said. He said the death toll was expected to rise. Closed-circuit television footage showed a fireball engulfing a street in front of one building, and a few cars rolled out of the billowing smoke.

Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said Tuesday that his government remained in control but said the city is surrounded by Russian troops.

“Military equipment and armored vehicles are coming from different directions,” he told The Washington Post in a phone interview.

Terekhov said a government building and the opera and ballet theater were among buildings shelled. Transformer stations were also struck by artillery, cutting off power to much of the city, he said. The shelling had stalled efforts to supply the city with food and medical supplies, he said.

“There are casualties, and by now, there are certainly a lot more of them, after the night and morning shelling,” he told the Post. “The situation is pretty grave.”

On Sunday, Russian troops entered Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, and fighting is underway in the streets, according to the Associated Press. Videos posted on Ukrainian media and social networks showed Russian vehicles moving across Kharkiv and a light vehicle burning on the street. Residents were urged to stay inside.

The troops in Kharkiv arrived after Russia unleashed a wave of attacks on Ukraine, targeting airfields and fuel facilities. Two large explosions rocked an area south of the capital just before 1 a.m. local time. Zelenskyy’s office said one of the blasts was near the Zhuliany airport and the other blast hit an oil depot about 25 miles south of the capital, according to the mayor of Vasylkiv via the AP. Russian forces also blew up a gas pipeline in Kharkiv, according to the Ukrainian president's office.

Russian forces attack Kyiv

The main Russian force has advanced slowly to within about 15 miles of Kyiv’s city center as they continue to face stiff Ukrainian opposition and their own logistical problems.

Ukrainian forces have attacked Russian troops and combat vehicles with small arms and surface-to-air missiles, a senior Defense Department official told reporters on Monday. The official discussed the military operations on condition of anonymity. Ukrainians have also blunted the Russian advance by blowing up bridges, the official said.

Since Sunday, the Russians have moved about three miles closer to the Ukrainian capital, the official said. They appear intent on encircling the city. Nearly 75% of the combat troops Russian President Vladimir Putin deployed for the war are inside Ukraine.

Meanwhile, Russian vehicles have been running out of gas, the official said. It’s unclear if that represents a failure of Russian officials to plan, or their troops inability to execute it.

Russia has also failed to control Ukraine’s airspace, with Ukrainian forces still able to fly warplanes and operate anti-aircraft missiles.

Russian forces closed in on Kyiv in the early hours of Saturday, but dawn brought limited clarity about how far the invading troops had penetrated into the Ukrainian capital. It was not immediately clear how far the soldiers had advanced. Skirmishes reported on the edge of the city suggested that small Russian units were probing Ukrainian defenses to clear a path for the main forces.

Russian forces attacked Boryspil International Airport, near the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. Ukraine closed its airspace to commercial flights, saying Russian missile attacks presented too high a risk.

Ukraine says 13 soldiers were killed after refusing to surrender on Snake Island

A group of Ukrainian soldiers who garnered worldwide attention after telling a Russian warship to “Go f--- yourself” may be alive, according to Ukrainian officials.

Ukraine's State Border Guard Service of Ukraine in a statement said the soldiers may have been captured by Russian forces and are still alive. The statement added that Russian media reports say the captured soldiers were sent to Sevastopol, a city in Crimea.

""We sincerely hope that the boys will return home as soon as possible, and the information received at the time of the attack on the death will not be confirmed,"" the statement says, and as translated in multiple reports.

The thirteen Ukrainian border guards stationed on Snake Island, a strategic small outpost in the Black Sea, were reportedly killed after a Russian warship asked them to surrender. A border guard responded with an expletive before being bombed, according to unverified audio. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said all 13 will be awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine posthumously.

Russia demands NATO exclude Ukraine

NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is a major factor in Russia’s decision to invade Ukraine, which wants to join NATO and the European Union. Other former Soviet republics have joined NATO over the years, and Putin is against Ukraine’s inclusion. In diplomatic talks, he demanded assurances from NATO that it wouldn’t admit Ukraine. NATO said the decision is up to Ukraine.

Putin declares Ukraine Donbas regions as independent republics

The Donbas region in eastern Ukraine has been divided by Russia-backed militants since 2014, when Russia illegally annexed Crimea. These forces control the “people’s republics” of Donetsk and Luhansk. Putin recognized both as independent republics Feb. 21, then sent Russian troops into them for “peacekeeping duties.”

When explosions first rang out across Ukraine around 5 a.m. local time on Thursday, residents scrambled for cover and headed for the country’s borders to flee to safety. Moscow had officially launched a series of attacks on the country, which Russian President Vladimir Putin had been foreshadowing.



Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country was under attack “from the south, north, east and from the air.” Russian ground forces entered regions across the country, bombs fell on major cities, and cruise and ballistic missiles targeted military control centers in the area of the capital, Kyiv. On the second day of the advance, as the capital was rocked by explosions, residents and leaders braced for the city to be overrun.

By Thursday afternoon, Russian forces had taken control of the Chernobyl nuclear plant north of Kyiv where a 1986 reactor explosion caused the release of large amounts of radiation into the environment.

The invasion represents what could be the largest security threat to Europe since World War II. Ukrainian officials reported that more than 100 Ukrainian soldiers and Russian soldiers have died, along with at least several civilians. The Ukrainian government warned residents in Obolon, a district north of the capital, not to go outside early Friday.

Belarus – a Russian puppet state which has been housing Kremlin forces for several weeks – lies around 50 miles north of Kyiv.

Images shared by Ukraine’s interior ministry showed one border point in the Kyiv region had been completely destroyed.

The interior ministry also said Russians tanks have entered the Luhansk region, claiming they have disguised some vehicles with the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe insignia.

At least eight people have been killed and nine were wounded by the Russian shelling, an advisor to the Ukrainian Minister of Internal Affairs said on Thursday, but the real figure is feared to be in the hundreds.

Russia claims to have ‘incapacitated’ Ukraine’s military infrastructure after a wave of strategic hits on sites across the country.

Videos posted to social media showed smoke rising above cities like Odesa and Kharkiv, while explosion have also been heard around Kyiv.

The Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dmytro Kuleba, said that Russia has launched a ‘full-scale invasion of Ukraine’.

Two airports near the western city of Lviv – the Ivano-Frankivsk airport and one in Lutsk – were destroyed by missile strikes.

The interior ministry also confirmed an order had been signed allowing the police to provide military veterans with guns.

A statement said: ‘Veterans of internal affairs who are ready to defend Ukraine will be given weapons.’

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky has already confirmed martial law is in place.

The Ukrainian border force said it is ‘fighting the occupier’ but Russian state organs claimed it was overpowering the military.
