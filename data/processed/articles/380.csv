The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

How you can help: Here are ways those in the U.S. can help support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.

2,98220b12-d960-4504-a00e-aad85bbe0d35,[],,"Russia's Defense Ministry warned on April 15 that it will intensify attacks on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, after accusing Ukraine of targeting Russian border towns.

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

The package includes laser-guided rocket systems, drones, ammunition, night-vision devices, tactical secure communications systems, medical supplies and spare parts.

""This decision underscores the United States' unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity in support of its heroic efforts to repel Russia's war of choice,"" Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said in a statement.

On Wednesday, U.S. President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy discussed ""additional capabilities"" to help the Ukrainian military, the White House said in a statement after the call.

In mid-March, Congress passed a funding bill that included $13.6 billion for humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine and NATO allies in Eastern Europe.

Shortly after, Biden announced $1 billion in new security assistance to Ukraine.

A large portion of the military equipment the United States has given to Ukraine has come from its own stockpile, through a process known as a ""presidential drawdown.""

Unlike that process, the $300 million announced Friday will go towards new contracts for military equipment from the Pentagon's defense industry partners.

One of the technologies included in the announcement are more Switchblade tactical drones.

Dubbed ""kamikaze drones,"" Switchblades can be directed by an operator to find and, when ready, plunge onto a target, exploding on contact.

Kirby added that the ""United States also continues to work with its allies and partners to identify and provide to the Ukrainians additional capabilities.""

Later Friday evening, The New York Times reported that following a request by Zelenskyy, the U.S. had decided to facilitate the transfer of Soviet-made tanks from allies to Ukraine.

The decision would mark the first time the U.S. has helped transfer tanks, though details about which countries would participate and how many tanks were being moved were not provided.

Citing a U.S. official, the report noted that the tanks will allow Ukraine to fire long-range artillery strikes against Russian targets in the eastern Donbas region.

Following weeks of fighting, Moscow said last week it will be focusing on the ""liberation"" of Donbas, where pro-Russian separatists have declared two independent republics.

In a press release, the department said that it had notified Congress of “additional assistance activities under authority provided by the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative.”

The money is aimed to bolster Ukraine’s defenses against Russia’s invasion that has been going on for more than a month.

This package includes tactical secure communications systems, a counter-unmanned aerial system, nonstandard machine guns and other defense systems.

“This decision underscores the United States’ unwavering commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity in support of its heroic efforts to repel Russia’s war of choice,” the Department of Defense stated.

Since the war began, the U.S. has given Ukraine more than $2.3 billion in defense assistance.

The money came the same day a U.S. official told The New York Times the U.S. will be assisting allies in giving Ukraine Soviet-made tanks in response to an appeal from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

The official, who spoke to the outlet on the condition of anonymity, did not give a specific timeline for when the tanks would be transferred but said it would be happening soon.

Thus far, the U.S. has provided military and humanitarian resources to Ukraine and issued crushing economic sanctions on Russian institutions and officials with close ties to the Kremlin.

In addition, Congress passed a massive bill in early March to fund the government that included $13.6 billion in aid to Ukraine.

However, the Biden administration and other western leaders have stopped short of granting Zelensky’s request for a no-fly zone to protect the country’s airspace.

President Biden himself said that the U.S. would not declare a no-fly zone in order to keep the country out of direct conflict with Russia, a nuclear power.

In a news release, the department stated that it had notified Congress of “additional assistance activities under authority provided by the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative.”

The initiative allows the U.S. to procure arms directly from manufacturers instead of delivering weapons from its own stockpiles to Ukraine, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told The Washington Post on Friday.

The package includes tactical secure communications systems, a counter-unmanned aerial system, nonstandard machine guns and other defense systems, The Hill reported.

According to the Post, the Pentagon has committed more than $1.6 billion in security assistance for Ukraine since Russia invaded the neighboring country on Feb. 24.

“This decision underscores the United States’ unwavering commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity in support of its heroic efforts to repel Russia’s war of choice,” Kirby stated.

Most notably, the new aid will include the provision of Puma unmanned aerial systems, which are hand-launched lightweight drones that can fly for about two hours with a range of about a dozen miles, the Post reported.

Other items included in the security-assistance package include armored Humvees, night-vision devices, thermal imagery systems, tactical secure communications systems, commercial satellite imagery services, medical supplies and Switchblade drones, which are small unmanned aircraft packed with explosives that crash into targets such as tanks in “kamikaze” fashion, the newspaper reported.

In addition to the security assistance, the U.S. and its allies have delivered humanitarian aid and issued crushing economic sanctions targeting both Russian officials and institutions but stopped short of granting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s request for a no-fly zone to protect the country’s airspace.

“This decision underscores the United States’ unwavering commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity in support of its heroic efforts to repel Russia’s war of choice,” Kirby said.

Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 and has pummeled some of its major cities with missiles and artillery attacks, triggering a mass exodus of refugees from the country.

Ukrainian forces, however, have largely stymied the Russian advance, and in some locations the defenders have even regained territory lost earlier in the conflict.

The new package of assistance for Ukraine that Kirby described includes laser-guided rocket systems, Switchblade tactical drones that in some cases are capable of taking out armored vehicles, Puma drones for surveillance and intelligence gathering, small and large caliber ammunition, night-vision devices, machine guns, communications equipment, medical supplies and other items.

The U.S. has provided Ukraine $1.6 billion in security assistance since the invasion began, Kirby said.

Under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, supplies and equipment are procured directly from defense industry contractors rather than drawing from Defense Department stocks, Kirby said.

Some Republican lawmakers have criticized the Biden administration for taking too long to get warfighting equipment to Ukraine, claims the Pentagon pushed back on earlier this week.

Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Va., during a House Armed Services Committee hearing Wednesday, chided top military leaders that deliveries were not being made fast enough.

Kirby disputed that notion during a news conference Thursday, saying that the first delivery of an $800 million military aid package approved by Biden on March 16 arrived in Ukraine four days later.

That entire package should be fully delivered by mid-April, Kirby told reporters.",https://www.stripes.com/theaters/us/2022-04-01/ukraine-military-aid-us-john-kirby-drones-300-million-pentagon-5554314.html
