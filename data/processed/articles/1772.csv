Russia accused of using mobile crematoria to destroy all traces of horrific atrocities

Russians are using mobile crematoria to conceal their atrocities and destroying traces of its army's crimes, Ukraine claims.

Preliminary estimates suggest at least 5,00 people died after the alleged genocide in Bucha, Kyiv Oblast.

The Centre for Strategic Communications and Information Security under the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy of Ukraine tweeted: ""In Mariupol, the Russian occupiers have started using mobile crematoria to conceal their atrocities, the city council says.

""Amid the #BuchaMassacre, the Russian leadership ordered to destroy the traces of its army's crimes in Mariupol.

""The occupiers are trying to identify and eliminate all potential witnesses to the atrocities.

""Local pro-Russian collaborators and ""DPR"" terrorists are burning the bodies of murdered residents.

""The process is coordinated by the self-proclaimed mayor Konstantin Ivashchenko.""

In a statement, Mariupol City Council reported: ""One week ago, cautious estimates put the death toll at 5,000.

""But given the size of the city, catastrophic destruction, the duration of the blockade and fierce resistance, tens of thousands of civilians from Mariupol could have fallen victim to the occupiers.

Russian artillery fire killed at least two people and wounded five at a humanitarian aid distribution point on Wednesday as Moscow's forces bombarded towns and cities in eastern Ukraine, local officials said.

Authorities in the eastern region of Luhansk urged civilians to evacuate ""while it is safe,"" warning that Russian bombardments could cut off escape routes.

Ukraine says Russian troops that invaded on February 24 are regrouping and preparing for a new offensive in the Donbas area, which includes both the Luhansk and Donetsk regions.

Donetsk Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko shared online photos from the town of Vuhledar, where he said Russian artillery fire had struck a humanitarian aid distribution point.

Satellite images of Bucha have been widely shared and appear to show bodies lying in the street almost two weeks before Russians left the town.

The horrifying pictures appear to show bodies in the exact locations where they were subsequently found by Ukrainian forces when they regained control of the town north of Kyiv.

There is an earlier satellite image available from Maxar on March 11 which appears to show bodies in the same locations, but is less clear than the one on March 19.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday described as ""genocide"" the killings of civilians in the town of Bucha outside the capital Kyiv reclaimed from Russian forces.

He said: ""These are war crimes and it will be recognised by the world as genocide.

""You stand here today and see what happened.

""We know that thousands of people have been killed and tortured with extremities cut off, women raped, children killed. It's genocide.""

Ukraine and Western nations have accused Russian troops of war crimes after the discovery of mass graves and apparently executed civilians at Bucha, prompting vows of action at the International Criminal Court.

Russia has denied targeting civilians and denies the alleged massacre.

Moscow instead claims the footage and images show ""fake dead bodies"" which were staged after its troops left the town on March 30.

Local officials reported fighting in many part of eastern Ukraine and there were also reports of shelling and fighting in the south, where the port city of Mariupol is surrounded and under siege from Russian forces.

Mariupol's capture could enable Russia to entrench a land passage between two separatist, self-proclaimed people's republics in Donbas and the Crimea region which Russia seized and annexed in 2014.",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russia-accused-using-mobile-crematoria-26648686

Mariupol City Council has said that “the occupiers have forcibly deported” civilians across the border and to Russian-held regions in eastern Ukraine.

It claimed Russian forces stormed a hospital in the southern port city and removed staff and patients for deportation.

Footage shared by Mariupol City Council – which has not been independently verified – claims to show Ukrainian medics and civilians being shuffled into an enemy tank in the besieged city, which has largely been reduced to rubble after weeks of intense Russian bombardment.

Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko said an estimated 40,000 residents have been deported from the region since the start of the invasion.

In a statement on Thursday, he said the city was “forming a database of illegally deported people in order to return every Mariupol resident to Ukraine”.

“Our goal is to create an effective mechanism for the return of these people,” he said, adding that this would prove “difficult work” and that he was working closely with Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the Donetsk regional administration.

Mr Boichenko said more than 5,000 people have died in the southeastern city since the start of the invasion, while 90 per cent of Mariupol’s infrastructure has been destroyed.

He added that a recent attack on Mariupol Children’s Hospital saw almost 50 people “burned alive”.

It follows claims that Russia has begun a widespread operation to erase all evidence of war crimes in cities such as Mariupol, as President Putin faces accusations of genocide from world leaders.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused the Kremlin of covering up evidence of mass casualties, marking a “shift” in Russia’s military strategy.

“We have information that the Russian military changed tactics and that they are trying to clear the streets and basements in the occupied territories of the bodies of the dead people, dead Ukrainians,” he said in his nightly video address.

“It is their efforts to hide the evidence, nothing more,” he added. “But they will not succeed, because they killed a lot of people.”

Mariupol City Council claimed on Wednesday that Russian forces have started deploying mobile crematoriums in Mariupol to cover up evidence of mass civilian “murders”.

“Murderers covering their tracks,” city officials wrote on Telegram. Mr Boichenko compared the scenes to “Nazi concentration camps”.

Mariupol officials suggested that a mass proof-clearing operation was behind Russia’s refusal to allow aid workers into Mariupol to evacuate civilians.

The International Comittee of the Red Cross (ICRC) told i that a team attempting to rescue people trapped in Mariupol had tried to reach the city for five days and four nights, but were unable to get within 20 kilometres as security conditions on the ground made it impossible to enter.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Wednesday that Russia’s actions in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha may amount to genocide as he promised “more sanctions and more penalties” on the Kremlin.

President Zelensky showed photographs of corpses in civilian clothing strewn along Bucha’s streets to a United Nations general meeting earlier this week. Many appeared to have been shot at close range, while some had their hands bound or their flesh burned.

Anatoliy Fedoruk, the Mayor of Bucha, said “almost 90 per cent” of attacks on Bucha residents were “bullet wounds, not shrapnel,” as he dismissed Moscow’s denials of targeted attacks on civilians.

Satellite footage also suggested that many of the bodies had been lying in the open for weeks, at the same time that Russian forces occupied the Kyiv suburb.

Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg warned that more horrors may emerge as Russian troops continue to pull back in the north.

“When and if they withdraw their troops and Ukrainian troops take over, I’m afraid they will see more mass graves, more atrocities and more examples of war crimes,” he said.

A US defence official said earlier this week that around two-thirds of Russian troops have fled the suburbs of Kyiv as the Kremlin refocuses its operations on “liberating” eastern Ukraine.

The reports have prompted calls for residents in the Ukrainian cities of Kharkiv, Luhansk and Donetsk to “flee now or risk death”.

Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk urged people living in the regions to evacuate immediately amid warnings of an imminent Russian assault on eastern Ukraine.

“It has to be done now because later people will be under fire and face the threat of death. There is nothing they will be able to do about it, nor will we be able to help,” she said.",https://inews.co.uk/news/russia-deport-doctors-medics-civilians-mariupol-war-crimes-cover-up-ukraine-1561408

Russian troops have been spotted using a horrifying mobile crematorium in Ukraine in a bid to hide the bodies of its own dead.

It is also believed that Vladimir Putin's army has used the massive machine to remove all traces of anyone it kills, too.

The truck containing the device was spotted in war-torn Mariupol, and in the now-destroyed Bucha, near Kyiv.

Details on exactly how the device is being used are sketchy, but local reports quote eyewitnesses as saying that there are “special Russian brigades” collecting bodies of “Mariupol residents murdered and killed as a result of the Russian invasion”.

There are also several local reports stating that Russia has been using the device to hide its own dead.

Russia’s attack on Ukraine: day 41

The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine provided further information on the situation on the front after 41 days of Russian aggression, focusing on the losses and problems of the invaders and the successes of the Ukrainian army. The 200th Mechanised Brigade of the Northern Fleet was to lose nearly 30% of its personnel (one battalion tactical group from this brigade was to be destroyed by the defenders, the other – withdrawn to regain combat capability to the Belgorod Oblast). In turn, the 236th Artillery Brigade of the 20th Combined Arms Army of the Western Military District (MD) was to lose nearly 20% of its troops and armament. A covert mobilisation is to be carried out in the Western MD, and the manpower of the units is to be supplemented with cadres from military educational institutions. The Armed Forces of Ukraine were to drive the enemy out of three localities in Kherson Oblast near the border with Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, and to shoot down eight winged missiles.

The Ukrainian General Staff has been reporting on the situation in the combat zone only cautiously. However, the communiqués draw attention to the growing threat of the territory of Transnistria being used for aggression (preparations are underway at Tiraspol airport to receive aircraft) and the possibility that the Russians may leave forces in Belarus in order to tie up Ukrainian units in the north, thus preventing them from strengthening other directions of defence. Representatives of the Ukrainian Interior Ministry point to the crucial importance of the clashes in the east, the intensity of which was expected to decrease in recent days, while Russian groupings in the direction of Sloviansk were reinforced. It was also suggested that a plan for the liberation of Kherson had been drawn up.

Local military-civilian administrations report that heavy fighting is taking place in eastern and southern Ukraine, and the aggressor has increased the intensity of missile-air strikes on critical infrastructure facilities. The blockade, shelling and bombing of Kharkiv continues (27 strikes were recorded on the night of 6 April, mainly against civilian targets). Clashes continue on the border between Kharkiv and Donetsk oblasts, where defenders were to repel one attack, and in the Sievierodonetsk area. In total, nine Russian attacks were to be repulsed in Donbas. Localities with Ukrainian positions have been continuously shelled and bombed. There has been a humanitarian catastrophe in the combat areas, as it is not possible to evacuate the remaining residents or provide them with assistance.

Data arriving from the Mykolaiv Oblast indicate that the aggressor forces have partially abandoned the positions previously held there (probably at the same time as they withdrew from the northern oblasts of Ukraine) and are concentrating on shelling and bombing from the Kherson Oblast. At the same time, fighting continues on the border between Kherson and Dnipropetrovsk Oblasts. The situation on the line of contact of troops in the northeastern part of the Zaporizhzhia Oblast has relatively calmed down. In the Odesa Oblast, the invader is to conduct aerial reconnaissance.

The Russians have continued missile and air strikes on critical infrastructure facilities across Ukraine, mainly on fuel depots and railway hubs. The Ukrainian side maintains an information blockade and speaks of the impact of the attacks only in the case of fires visible from afar. From the residual data, it appears that the aggressor’s target is likely to be primarily fuel tankers transported by rail, possibly with ammunition (as evidenced by reports of explosions). The attacks took place in the north of the Poltava Oblast, in the Kremenets District of the Ternopil Oblast, in the vicinity of the towns of Novomoskovsk and Synelnykove in the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast (two attacks took place, the second one – at night – was carried out by the air force; it was reported that a fuel depot was destroyed), Radekhiv in the Lviv Oblast and Koziatyn in the Vinnytsia Oblast.

On 5 April, the Ukrainian government supplemented the list of weapons that can be used by members of voluntary formations of territorial communities with small arms (until now there was a permission to use private hunting weapons). The most important change is the confirmation of their right to use artillery weapons, guided and unguided missiles, grenade launchers, flame throwers, mines and grenades. Earlier, the Verkhovna Rada equated territorial defence volunteers with war veterans, granted them the status of veterans and persons disabled as a result of warfare.

The withdrawal of Russian troops from the northern oblasts has prompted a response from the Belarusian defence ministry. The Belarusians have deployed mechanised infantry, airborne infantry, artillery and unmanned aerial vehicle units near the border. They have protected critical infrastructure facilities – including railway lines, bridges and viaducts. Fire positions for infantry and artillery have been established in their vicinity. Tasks are carried out in cooperation with border service units and field bodies of the Ministry of Interior.

The aggressor continues its brutal pacification operations in the occupied territories with the help of local collaborators. The mayor of occupied Kherson reported that the occupation forces are taking steps to identify local activists and families of Ukrainian soldiers. Collaborators took over the databases of the local Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and police, which had been abandoned before the occupation of the city, without destroying the data carriers. The National Guard and the FSB, using the information at their disposal, carry out searches and interrogations, and on occasion rob the property of people suspected of anti-Russian attitudes.

In occupied Izium in the Kharkiv Oblast, the aggressor’s soldiers are deliberately preventing humanitarian aid from reaching the inhabitants and are trying to force them to leave for the Belgorod Oblast. They have proscription lists and are catching people who fought in territorial defence or otherwise support the Ukrainian army. Mobile telephony and the Internet are not functioning in the city. Fire from automatic weapons is opened on people trying to escape. The mayor of Rubizhne in the Luhansk Oblast, which has sided with the occupying forces, provided information on individuals representing pro-Ukrainian attitudes. The SBU detained the head of the Mykolaiv district prosecutor’s office on charges of treason. It has evidence that he collaborated with representatives of the Russian security forces, providing them with data on the situation in the region.

During the 35 days of occupation of Hostomel, a town in the Kyiv Oblast, more than 400 people went missing. They were most likely abducted and some were killed. According to the local authorities, the Russians had time to cover the traces of their crimes before withdrawing from the town.

The municipal authorities in Mariupol have reported that Russian mobile crematoria have started operating in the partially occupied city. It was recalled that a week ago conservative estimates put the death toll at 5,000, but – given the size of the city and the duration of the blockade – the victims could be tens of thousands of residents. The invaders have formed special brigades to destroy the bodies of the dead, manned by local collaborators and members of the units of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic. The work of these groups is coordinated by the self-styled mayor Konstantin Ivashchenko, who is collaborating with the Russians.

Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov appealed to citizens not to panic over the information about the impending attack of the aggressor. He stressed that the city’s defensive capabilities had been increased and that its assault would bring serious losses to enemy forces. He warned that the Russians, as part of a psychological operation, would try to create panic among the citizens.

Units of the National Guard of Ukraine have entered the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. The main tasks of the service include protecting and defending the power plant facilities and protecting fissile materials.

The Finance Ministry has admitted that the created volunteer IT forces bringing together IT specialists from Ukraine and other countries have attacked more than 600 Russian Internet resources since the beginning of the aggression. The aim of the attacks is to paralyse the functioning of the digital resources of the state institutions there, large corporations, communications operators, banks and the electronic digital signature service.

As of April 1, the value of losses caused by Russia’s military actions is estimated to be at least $68 billion. The authorities in Kyiv estimate that since 24 February, approximately 26,000 m2 of residential space, 533 educational institutions, 196 health care facilities, 300 kindergartens, 8 civilian airports, 10 military airports, 129 factories and enterprises, over 22,000 km of roads, 226 bridges and viaducts have been destroyed. Indirect losses to the economy are estimated at $600 billion.

The Cabinet of Ministers has allocated 32.8 billion hryvnias (about $1.1 billion) from the reserve fund of the state budget for the urgent needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It also decided to transfer 1.45 billion hryvnias ($50 million) to the SBU. The additional funds will be spent on salaries, equipment, weapons, fuel and other supplies.

On 5 April, 3846 people were evacuated through humanitarian corridors, 2216 of whom arrived in Zaporizhzhia from Mariupol and Berdiansk by their own transport. In addition, 1080 people from Luhansk Oblast were evacuated. A column of seven buses escorted by representatives of the International Red Cross intended for Mariupol residents was blocked and then turned back by Russian troops. Ukrainian Railways said it was transporting more than 8,000 people a day from Kramatorsk and Sloviansk in the Donetsk Oblast. Eleven humanitarian corridors from southern Ukraine to Zaporizhzhia and Bakhmut were agreed on 6 April. The authorities hope that additional groups of women with children and wounded people can be transported out of Mariupol along with Turkish citizens with the mediation of Turkey.

The Rating Agency has published a poll conducted on 30–31 March, according to which support for Ukraine’s membership of NATO, which had risen from 62 to 76% at the beginning of the war, has fallen to 68%. At the same time, 91% of respondents are in favour of the country’s integration into the EU (a record level in the history of the poll), and only 4% are against. 56% of respondents believe that Ukraine will become an EU member within one-two years, while another 23% believe that the process will take up to five years. 85% of respondents are convinced that the country will be victorious in its war with Russia, with 1% holding the opposite view.

A group of human rights NGOs protested against the disconnection of TV channels Espreso, Priamyj and 5 channel from the digital platform, which took place on 4 April. It considered such action a restriction of freedom of expression and asked the president and the authorities to restore the broadcasts.

In a wide-ranging interview with Ukrainian media, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine’s victory would be to defend its sovereignty and regain territories controlled before 24 February. He also stated that Russia’s demands for denazification and demilitarisation had been rejected by Kyiv. Zelensky explained the continuation of negotiations after the revelation of the aggressor’s crimes in Bucha by saying that dialogue sometimes succeeds in reaching agreement on humanitarian issues. Ukraine is currently in talks with the US, France, Germany, Turkey, the UK, Poland, Israel and Italy on receiving security guarantees, but this is not the final list. The president identified the status of Donbas as the most difficult issue in negotiations with Russia. The EU and Ukraine were to reach an agreement on the establishment of a joint commission on Russian crimes in the Kyiv Oblast.

Russia is taking international action to mitigate its image damage after the revelation of a war crime in Bucha. Minister Sergei Lavrov claimed that the Ukrainian accusations were fabricated and said that Kyiv wanted to break off peace negotiations in this way. He also admitted that Ukraine categorically refuses to discuss denazification, demilitarisation and the status of the Russian language. He stressed that Russia would not agree to the immediate withdrawal of its troops even after the conclusion of the peace agreement. He regarded the position put forward by Ukrainian negotiators on the need to hold a referendum on the conclusion of such an agreement as playing for time. During the UN Security Council meeting to discuss the aggression against Ukraine and the OSCE Council of Permanent Representatives meeting devoted to the mass murder of civilians in Bucha, Russian diplomats denied the involvement of local soldiers in the crimes, describing the ‘Bucha case’ as a propaganda operation by the Kyiv authorities to discredit Russia.

According to information from the Polish Border Guard, 2.523 million people have left Ukraine for Poland since the beginning of the war, and 21,000 on 5 April (a 13% increase on the previous day). In the opposite direction, 485,000 people have crossed the border since 24 February.

The latest: The weeks-long resistance in besieged Mariupol appeared to be cracking as Russian forces moved closer to capturing the seaside port city in southeastern Ukraine, with a Russian-imposed deadline for Ukrainian forces in the city to surrender passing early Sunday local time. Meanwhile, officials in the capital Kyiv and the western city of Lviv reported explosions Saturday. Moscow has withdrawn its forces from those regions to focus on eastern Ukraine, but airstrikes have continued.

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.
