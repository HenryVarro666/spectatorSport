Over the course of the first 13 days of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, civilian deaths have risen steeply. There have been multiple, verifiable incidents of cluster munitions being used in urban areas.

Cluster munitions are a type of weapon that deploy a large number of smaller sub-munitions over a target. These sub-munitions then spread and explode over a larger area, increasing the potential for casualties.

Therefore cluster munitions are often criticised as weapons that pose “an immediate threat to civilians during conflict” and for the “long-lasting” problems they can cause if sub-munitions do not explode upon first impact.

More than 100 countries have banned their use and signed up to the Convention on Cluster Munitions. However, neither Russia nor Ukraine (which also possesses cluster munitions) has put their name to this agreement.

Russia has continued to use them, most notably in eastern Ukraine in 2014 and later in Syria.

Ukraine denied using cluster munitions during the conflict with Russian-backed separatists in the east of the country in 2014, despite a Human Rights Watch (HRW) report that stated it likely had.

In recent weeks, Bellingcat has documented these weapons landing near schools, hospitals and in residential areas of Ukrainian cities such as Kharkiv, Odesa and Kherson, seemingly often far away from noticeable military targets.

Due to concerns around the significant civilian harm cluster munitions can cause, Bellingcat is tracking the use of these weapons inside Ukraine.

We have identified several types of cluster munitions used in attacks on Ukrainian villages, towns and cities.

Identifying the type of cluster munitions being used can, in some cases, help provide clues as to who is using them. How and where they land can also help identify where they are being fired from.

Below are the types of cluster munition we have seen so far. We encourage readers who have noticed uses of these, or other types of cluster munitions, to reply to our Twitter thread here to help us collect, archive and investigate further.

RBK-500 Unguided Cluster Bomb with PTAB-1M Submunitions

So far, only one example of a aircraft-dropped cluster munition has been documented in Ukraine since the start of the invasion in late February, the RBK-500 cluster bomb loaded with PTAB-1M Submunitions (a high-explosive anti-tank munition). The following video, filmed in Zatoka, Odesa by Ukraine’s State Emergency Service, shows the remains of an RBK-500 cluster bomb, loaded with PTAB-1M Submunitions, inside the city’s White House Hotel (46.0635136, 30.44085,15).

The RBK-500 cluster munition has seen widespread use in the conflict in Syria, including RBK-500 ZAB-2.5M, RBK-500 AO-2.5RT, RBK-500U and RBK-500 PTAB-1M variants, but so far the documented use of the munition in Ukraine has been rare.

9M54 Series Missile with 3B30 HEAT-FRAG (DPICM) Submunitions

Cluster munition use in Ukraine thus far appears to have been dominated by the deployment of surface-to-surface rockets and missiles, including the 9M544 missile.

The remains of this missile were documented in Pokrovsk, northwest of Russian-controlled Donetsk in Eastern Ukraine, and Chornomors’ke village in Kherson, near Russian-occupied Crimea.

These are remains of cluster munitions launched by a 9A52-4 Tornado multiple rocket launcher, only used by Russian forces, that landed on the Ukrainian village of Chornomorske, Kherson. We've dozens of these incidents using Russian cluster munitions in civilian population centres https://t.co/289KQrTnEs pic.twitter.com/scU46s3Zvz — Eliot Higgins (@EliotHiggins) March 9, 2022

While no submunitions were documented with the example from Pokrovsk, the remains of Russian 3B30 submunitions (a high-explosive anti-tank fragmentation munition) were documented at the site of the Chornomors’ke village attack, as seen in the below video.

Close up images of the 3B30 submunition, and the submunitions that had failed to deploy correctly were shared with Bellingcat by locals from Chornomors’ke.

It should be noted that the 9M54 series missiles are guided missiles, with a reported circular area of probability (the radius of a circle within which half of a missile’s projectiles are expected to fall) of seven to 15 metres, compared to 150 metres for the unguided 9M55 series rockets (discussed below) used by BM-30 Smerch multiple rocket launchers.

The 9M54 series rockets are used only by Russian forces, having been deployed in a recent programme to upgrade Russia’s multiple rocket launcher systems.

Smerch 9M55K and Uragan 9M27K Cluster Rockets with 9N210 or 9N235 Submunitions

The most common types of cluster munition documented in the conflict has been the 9M55K and 9M27K cluster rocket fired by BM-30 Smerch and BM-27 Uragan multiple rocket launchers. These cluster munitions were frequently used by both sides in the 2014 conflict in Ukraine, as documented by Human Rights Watch in a June 2015 report. They are now being documented in locations across Ukraine, most frequently in the city of Kharkiv.

Both rockets are similar in appearance, the most distinctive difference being the configuration of the tail fins, and the position of rows of holes on the cluster munition container, visible after it has deployed.

We’re seeing a lot of images of cluster munitions being used in Ukraine, so there’s a few things I want to highlight to assist with reporting of the incidents. There’s two types of rockets, fired by BM-27 and BM-30 multiple rocket launchers. pic.twitter.com/j87onDj6kk — Eliot Higgins (@EliotHiggins) February 28, 2022

The 9N210 and 9N235 submunitions carried by the rockets are outwardly identical, with the manufacturing markings being the key indicator of the specific type of submunition used (for example, if ​it is ​9N210 or 9N235 this is noted on the outside casing). It is notable that submunitions documented at the scene of attacks have markings indicating dates of manufacture after Russia ceased arms sales to Ukraine:

A verified image first acquired by @bellingcat shows the attack included Russian-manufactured 300mm Smerch rockets with 9N235 cluster munitions. The 2019 manufacture date, after Russia stopped selling these arms to Ukraine, indicates that the attack was launched by Russia. pic.twitter.com/pvFsAq3kfB — Amnesty International (@amnesty) March 3, 2022

9M79-series Tochka Ballistic Missile with a 9N123 Cluster Munition Warhead

Along with the shorter ranged 9M27, 9M54 and 9M55 series rockets and missiles, longer range ballistic missiles have been used to deliver cluster submunitions in Ukraine. The remains of 9M79-series Tochka ballistic missiles have been documented in several locations in Ukraine. In one incident, it was possible to identify the payload of one of those missiles as containing cluster submunitions.

On February 24, at a hospital just outside the town of Vuhledar, Human Rights Watch reported that four civilians were killed, and 10 wounded, after a cluster munition attack using a Tochka ballistic missile armed with a 9N123 cluster munition warhead struck the area around the hospital:

This is currently the only incident Bellingcat is aware of where a Tochka ballistic missile armed with a cluster munition warhead has been used in the conflict. In its aftermath, Human Rights Watch said Russian forces should “stop using cluster munitions” and halt the use of weapons that “indiscriminately kill and maim.”

Iskander-M 9M723 Ballistic Missile

Most recently, on March 9, the remains of a cluster variant of an Iskander-M 9M723 missile were documented by local police in the city of Kramatorsk, north of Donetsk, as having been shot down by the Ukrainian military. This is the first documented sighting of a cluster variant of an Iskander launched missile. These powerful weapons have a range of several hundred kilometres.

Submunitions have yet to be documented in relation to this attack but the remains of the munition clearly indicate that it is the cluster munition variant of the missile.

5,d878694f-90fb-4f70-b2df-418111ce67e7,"['Brent M. Eastwood', 'Written By']",2022-03-11 22:54:35+00:00,"Update on Russian Use of Cluster Bombs – Russian cluster bombs are terrorizing Ukrainian civilians in an endless barrage on cities that is only likely to get worse.

Russians are surrounding and besieging population centers with multiple-launch rocket systems that have clustering submunitions that explode in the air and rain down bomblets on innocent people.

Some of the bomblets do not explode and litter streets that endanger pedestrians who may step on them accidentally. Their use has promoted an international humanitarian outcry.

Human Rights Organizations Are Blaming Russia for the Carnage

The United Nations Human Rights office delivered a statement on March 11 that decried the Russians. Indiscriminate bombing by Vladimir Putin’s forces is amounting to charges of war crimes by the international community.

“Due to their wide area effects, the use of cluster munitions in populated areas is incompatible with the international humanitarian law principles governing the conduct of hostilities,” UN spokesperson Liz Throssell told journalists in Geneva.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg also suspects Russia is employing cluster bombs in civilian-inhabited areas.

What Are Cluster Bombs?

Cluster bombs are deadly and pernicious. They burst open above ground and deliver high-fragmentation submunitions. Scores of them can kill and maim those underneath the blast – a radius that can encompass several football fields. Russia has been using these munitions since the beginning of the war and 1945 has documented how they have killed adults and children. Unexploded bomblets can take years to clear and risk additional injuries as they lay in wait for unsuspecting people.

How Are They Delivered?

The most likely source of Russian cluster munitions are coming from multiple-launch rocket systems such as the Uragan, Smerch and Grad that have exploded in Kharkiv, Odessa, and Kherson, among other cities. It appears that Russian warplanes are dropping cluster munitions at lower rates. There have been reports of Putin’s air force delivering the RBK-500 cluster bomb loaded with PTAB-1M submunitions that are actually for destroying enemy tanks. So, cluster bombs meant for armored vehicles are being used against civilians. That gives you an idea of their destructive power.

There is a 2008 convention against the use of cluster bombs, but Russia and Ukraine (and the United States) are not signatories. Over 100 states are part of the convention.

Indiscriminate Use Against Non-Combatants Is the Problem

Cluster bomb use against military targets does not exactly break international law, but indiscriminate deployment against civilians without warning or without creating a humanitarian corridor for people to escape before their use could be considered a war crime.

Human Rights Watch is trying to interview witnesses and examine photos and videos. There is ample evidence of unexploded bomblets littering the ground in neighborhoods around the country. This would give the International Criminal Court assistance for their own separate investigation into Russian attacks on civilians that is ongoing as of March 11.

Cluster Bomb Use Likely to Continue

Bombing cities is the Russian way of war as they have exhibited willingness to destroy neighborhoods during their intervention in Syria. The Russians think they can use civilian bombing to break the will of the Ukrainian people and get President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the negotiating table quicker.

Cluster bomb use by the Russians is not likely to cease. Invading forces are only limited by the number of rockets or air-dropped bombs that are in the Russian inventory. Putin will continue to deny their use. Now is the time for a cease-fire that will allow Ukrainian residents to leave the cities safely. Otherwise, they will have to hide in basements and subways to avoid the scourge of cluster bombs.

13 March

In the early hours of the morning Russian missiles struck a Ukrainian base in West Ukraine, just 10 miles from the Polish border. The attack on what is believed to be a training base reportedly killed 35. The attack follows Kremlin warnings thst Western aid will be considered a valid military target.

President Zelensky has said that nearly 125,000 people have been evacuated using humanitarian corridors. With the focus now on Mariupol. He said “our diplomatic effort is focused on aid to reach the city.”

Ukrainian forces are reported to be making localised counterattacks in northeastern Ukraine to relieve pressure on Kharkiv and threaten Russia’s extended supply lines. The besieged southern port of Mariupol continues to hold out and yesterday the Ukrainian military claimed it has rendered 31 Russian battalion tactical groups combat ineffective.

12 March

Russia continues to bombard the besieged Ukrainian cities of Mariupol, Kharkiv, Summy and Chernihiv but reports suggest they efforts to advance have largely been stalled. The Russian Ministry of Defense, however, claims small but significant advances. The situation on the southern front appears to have stabilised with Russian advances, from Crimea, toward Mykolayiv and Zaporizhya halted.

Yesterday the Kremlin announced plans on to deploy foreign fighters, including up to 16,000 Syrian fighters, to Ukraine. There have also been suggestions of ‘volunteers’ from the Central African Republic. This comes in response to the flow of foreign volunteers to Ukraine’s foreign legion.

Russia appears to be attempting to draw Belarus into an active role in the war. This would ease Russia’s problems with reserves and likely open up a fresh front in the north. The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense claimed yesterday that Russian aircraft conducted an attempted false-flag attack on Belarusian territory. Belarus has not yet actively mobilised.
