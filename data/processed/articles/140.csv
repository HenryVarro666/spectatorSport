Dmytro Kuleba, the Ukrainian minister of foreign affairs, was in Brussels on Thursday as a guest at a meeting of the military alliance's foreign affairs ministers, where he pleaded for more weapons to battle Russia in its existential war with Russia.

“Either you help us now -- and I'm speaking about days, not weeks, or your help will come too late, and many people will die, many civilians will lose their homes, many villages will be destroyed. Exactly because this help came too late,"" Kuleba told reporters.

He also stressed that Ukraine is proposing a ""fair deal"" to NATO allies.

""You provide us with everything that we need. And we will fight for our security, but also for your security, so that Putin, President Putin will have no chance to test Article five of the North Atlantic Treaty,"" he said.

NATO Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg, said more weapons were on the way, but he failed to provide a delivery timeline.

NATO members on Thursday expressed further support for efforts to help Ukraine to defend itself against Russian aggression and condemned crimes against civilians, Croatian Foreign Affairs Minister Gordan Grlic-Radman said on Thursday.

“We have expressed support for further efforts to help Ukraine,” Grlic-Radman said after a two-day meeting of NATO ministers of foreign affairs in Brussels.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba also attended the meeting, as did the foreign affairs ministers of Sweden and Finland, the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and the foreign affairs ministers of Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that the alliance members had agreed that the military aid to Ukraine should be stepped up.

This was also requested by Ukrainian Foreign Affairs Minister Kuleba. He told a press conference that they had not discussed a list of weapons Ukraine would receive, but that the conversation focused on the timeframe.

“I do not doubt we will get the weapons we need, the only question is when,” said Kuleba.

Either you will help us now, and I am talking about days here, not weeks, or your help will come too late, many people will die, many civilians will lose their homes, many villages will be destroyed, and just because help arrived too late, the Ukrainian minister warned.

Kuleba said that the sanctions imposed by the West could not stop the war on their own, although they were doing damage to Russia.

Stoltenberg said that the alliance members had agreed help should also be provided to partner countries threatened by Russia, namely Georgia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.",https://hr.n1info.com/english/news/nato-to-step-up-help-to-ukraine/

BRUSSELS — The top Ukrainian diplomat made a pointed appeal to NATO on Thursday to expedite arms supplies to Ukrainian forces, weaponry he said is urgently needed before Russia launches an expected offensive in the eastern part of the country.

ArrowRight Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called for swift action at a meeting of senior officials from across the Western alliance, where he put forward what he said was a threefold agenda: “weapons, weapons, weapons.”

“The more weapons we get, and the sooner they arrive in Ukraine, the more human lives will be saved,” Kuleba said before the meeting. “The more cities and villages will not be destructed. And there will be no more Buchas,” he said, referring to the Kyiv suburb where the withdrawal of Russian troops revealed horrific scenes of human suffering, including the bodies of civilians who appeared to have been tortured and summarily executed.

“I call on all allies to put aside their hesitations, their reluctance to provide Ukraine with everything it needs,” Kuleba continued. “Because, as weird as it may sound, but today weapons serve the purpose of peace.”

Secretary of State Antony Blinken the United States and its allies are considering sending more weapons but did not make a specific announcement. “We’re looking day in and day out at what we believe they most need, to include new systems that have not heretofore been provided,” he said at a news conference in Brussels. “We’re not going to let anything stand in the way of getting Ukrainians what they need and what we believe can be effective,” he said.

British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said NATO allies had agreed to step up support by providing “new and heavier equipment” to Ukraine. “We have agreed to help Ukraine move from their Soviet-era equipment to NATO-standard equipment on a bilateral basis,” she said, without providing specifics on what might be shipped or when.

Kuleba said forces loyal to Kyiv, struggling to gain an upper hand against the larger Russian military, require aircraft, armored vehicles, missiles and additional air defense systems. NATO countries have provided an increasing array of arms since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began in February, including antiaircraft missiles, tanks and kamikaze drones. But alliance members, nervous that Russia might launch a retaliatory attack against NATO territory, have stopped short of sending fighter jets or establishing a no-fly zone over Ukraine.

Kuleba told reporters after the meetings that he was confident additional kinds of weaponry would eventually be provided but said he was concerned they would not be sent fast enough. He said he had given NATO ministers a request with a specific timeline.

Meeting stiff resistance from Ukrainian forces, Russia has pulled troops back from positions around Kyiv and turned them toward southern and eastern Ukraine. Kuleba said the expected Russian offensive focused on the eastern Donbas region could resemble World War II with large military maneuvers involving thousands of tanks, armored vehicles, artillery and aircraft.

“This is why it is so urgent for allies not to, how to put it mildly, not to tell us that they’re still thinking that they have to do all the procedures, that there are remaining issues that have to be sorted out before they make decisions,” he said. “Either you help us now, and I’m speaking about days not weeks, or your help will come too late. And many people will die, many civilians will lose their homes, many villages will be destroyed exactly because this help came too late.”

This blunt appeal in Brussels echoed the approach other Ukrainian leaders, particularly President Volodymyr Zelensky, have taken as they seek to rally the world against the assault led by Russian President Vladimir Putin by using direct criticism of anything less than full support for Ukraine and identifying nations that fail to meet that mark.

Earlier in the day, Kuleba named Germany as an example of nations that have held back from giving as much military support as they might provide. “While Berlin has time, Kyiv doesn’t,” he said. “I think the deal that Ukraine is offering is fair. You give us weapons, we sacrifice our lives, and the war is contained in Ukraine,” he said. “This is it.

Retired U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, a former commander of U.S. Army Europe, said the support of allies is critical as the war enters a “decisive new phase.” Ukrainian forces are running low on ammunition, he said. While allies are becoming more willing to send weapons, what has been sent so far is “not enough,” he said.

“The administration and NATO need to talk about winning, about helping Ukraine win, not just about avoiding losing, or preventing Russia from winning,” he said. Winning, according to Hodges, would mean a return to the lines before the war and rendering Russia unable to resume its offensive. “We need to see a sense of urgency,” he said, “something like the Berlin airlift.”

Divisions among Western nations about how far to go with military aid to Ukraine are also visible in the economic arena, as some countries call for more drastic action to deprive Russia of energy income, while others balk at steps that could increase the burden felt by European consumers.

The European Union this week proposed a ban on Russian coal imports, but the bloc has yet to halt the purchases of Russian oil and natural gas that continue to provide Moscow a valuable flow of cash. Ukraine has condemned that position and has called for, on top of a slew of global sanctions already in place, all Russian banks to be cut off from the global financial system.

The Biden administration on Wednesday announced new measures targeting Putin’s adult children and additional Russian banks. Blinken said Thursday that he sees a growing commitment from Europe to end its dependence on Russian energy.

“We’ve seen again and again Russia use energy as a weapon, as political leverage, and of course the proceeds it gets from the sale of its energy is now, yes, helping to fuel its aggression against Ukraine,” he said. “But it’s not like flipping a light switch. You have to do it methodically. ” he said. “You have to put in place the necessary alternatives.”

Images of mass graves and civilian corpses lying in the streets of Bucha, a city in the Kyiv region, have prompted international outrage. Even before those atrocities were revealed, the Biden administration announced last month a formal assessment that Russian forces were committing war crimes in Ukraine.

“The sickening images and accounts coming out of Bucha and other parts of Ukraine have only strengthened our collective resolve and unity,” Blinken said Thursday.

In a further sign of global anger at Russia, the NATO meeting was attended by ministers from Japan, Australia, South Korea, New Zealand, Georgia, Finland and Sweden. After talks on the sidelines of the NATO meeting, ministers from the Group of Seven bloc called for Russia’s suspension from the U.N. Human Rights Council. The U.N. General Assembly subsequently voted in favor of that suspension.

In remarks posted Wednesday on the State Department’s Telegram channel as part of an attempt to reach a Russian audience, Blinken said arms provided by Western nations have been instrumental in blocking Russia’s attempt to seize Kyiv.

The Biden administration has announced weapons transfers to Ukraine including, most recently, $100 million of Javelin antitank missiles. “What we’re focused on is making sure that we get to Ukraine the systems that they can use now and use effectively,” Blinken said.

“At the same time, we’re looking at other systems, some of them larger and more sophisticated, that may be useful and important going forward, but where, for example, Ukrainians need to be trained, because some of these systems, you can’t just turn them over and have them be used immediately,” Blinken said.

Speaking to reporters, Kuleba said nations that cited the need for lengthy training had slowed the supply of weapons unnecessarily, because if they had signed off on such systems at the beginning of the war, they would already be in Ukrainian hands.

Asked about a video circulating that appeared to show Ukrainian troops executing a Russian service member, Kuleba said Ukrainian forces respect the laws of war and that the incident would be investigated. He seemed to grow emotional as he described how Ukrainians are responding to abuses occurring during the war.

“You don’t understand how it feels to see pictures from Bucha, talking to people who escaped, knowing that the person you know was raped four days in a row,” he said. “You don’t understand how it feels that Russian soldiers rape children. This is not an excuse to those who violate the rules of war on either side of the front line. But there are some things which you simply can’t understand, I’m sorry.”

Read the Full Transcript

Amna Nawaz: Well, there were more revelations today of the depth of carnage and devastation across Northern Ukraine, as Russian forces redeployed to the east.

Elsewhere, the mayor of the southwestern port city of Mariupol said there were as many as 5,000 dead in his besieged city and roughly 100,000 civilians still trapped. Meanwhile, at NATO, foreign ministers met to discuss further military aid to Ukraine. And the United Nations took a rare vote to kick Russia off its Human Rights Council.

But we begin again tonight with special correspondent Simon Ostrovsky and videographer Yegor Troyanovsky, reporting from a small village northwest of Kyiv, where the air is filled with fear and death.

And a warning: Some images in this report are disturbing.

Simon Ostrovsky: In Yahidne, Northern Ukraine, a mother's sorrow.

Woman (through translator): His eyes were covered.

Simon Ostrovsky: Today, volunteers have recovered the body of one of her sons shot during the Russian occupation of this village in the Chernihiv region.

Ludmila Shevchenko (ph) is too distraught to speak. Her younger son was last seen being led away blindfolded with his hands tied, accused by the occupying Russian force of helping Ukrainian troops direct their fire, we're told by Shevchenko's son-in-law.

Her younger son was found here, buried in his own garden by the soldiers who killed him. It's the sixth body recovered here in the last two days that's believed to be an execution.

Woman (through translator): A 12-year-old child, and her head's come off.

Simon Ostrovsky: As many as 20 villagers didn't survive the month the Russians were here, including a 12-year-old girl and her stepfather who died in their car as they tried to flee.

The rest of the villagers, nearly 380 people, were held against their will in the basement of the school, used as a human shield by Russian troops, who made it their headquarters.

Valentyna Shylo, Music Teacher (through translator): We were human shields. We could see that. We could see that clearly as they were shooting back and forth.

Simon Ostrovsky: The villagers were packed so tightly in the basement, 11 of its more frail residents didn't survive the month-long ordeal. They used buckets as toilets and were rarely allowed to go outside for fresh air.

Valentyna Shylo (through translator): They tried to make us learn the Russian national anthem. If you learn the Russian anthem, you can go home: Yes, we will let you go. And if you don't, you will have to stay here.

Simon Ostrovsky: ""Did you do it?"" I ask.

Valentyna Shylo (through translator): No. No one learned it. No one did.

Simon Ostrovsky: Valentyna Shylo is a music teacher here. She jokes that she's now put in double overtime at the school as she leads me into the dark cellar, where she and the others lived for weeks.

Valentyna Shylo (through translator): My little chair. I wrote the last names of some of the people who were here down.

Simon Ostrovsky: What we have here is really interesting and give us an insight into what Russian army life is like. This case is labeled ""Military Political Preparedness.""

In other words, these are ideological materials that the Russian soldiers used to prepare themselves and ready themselves for patriotism in serving their country. Apparently, the troops that occupied this village came from a Buddhist region. There is a book here from the Dalai Lama. There's Tuvan magazine. And there's a lot of other materials about patriotism in Russia, with the national anthem, important dates from military history and the military oath that soldiers are supposed to take.

The soldiers who came here apparently planned to stay for a long time. A local man shows us the classrooms Russian soldiers turn into their barracks, leaving behind cigarette butts, food wrappers, and feces.

Man (through translator): This is where they lived. Look at the state of this place. The officers were in there. This was their so-called rec room.

Simon Ostrovsky: They slept easier on these mattresses, knowing there were hundreds of civilians in the basement below them, he tells me.

Halyna, Yahidne Resident (through translator): The most upsetting thing was watching how they bring you water, as if they're helping you, in your own children's shoes. One Tuvan who brought me water was wearing sneakers from my apartment over there. It's painful to watch.

None of this was free. We built all of this with our own hands. Then they came, looted the place, destroyed it, and then punished us on top of that. We were being punished. So they wouldn't open the cellar. They blocked the doors.

Simon Ostrovsky: The war in Ukraine has been brutal from the start. The aerial bombings and shellings of civilian areas of cities by the Russian forces probably rises to the level of a war crime. But there's something about the evidence that has emerged over the last week of deliberate killings that has really galvanized the world's attention to what's happening here, because it can't be claimed that these deaths were an accident.

Far from these killing fields, foreign ministers met at NATO headquarters in Brussels today, pledging to send more military aid to Ukraine and bolster Europe's eastern flank.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Western leaders would remain united against Russia's invasion.

Antony Blinken, U.S. Secretary of State: The sickening images and accounts coming out of Bucha and other parts of Ukraine have only strengthened our collective resolve and unity. We're sustaining and building on pressure on the Kremlin and its enablers.

Simon Ostrovsky: Ahead of the meeting, Ukraine's top diplomat said his nation needs three things: weapons, weapons and weapons.

Later, Dmytro Kuleba added urgency.

Dmytro Kuleba, Ukrainian Foreign Minister: Either you help us now — and I'm speaking about days, not weeks — or your help will come too late. And many people will die. Many civilians will lose their homes. Many villages will be destroyed, exactly because this help came too late.

Simon Ostrovsky: After two days of talks, European leaders said today they approved a fifth round of sanctions, including a historic ban on Russian coal imports. Expected to take effect in August, it's the bloc's first move to target Russian energy.

Western officials believe all Russian troops have now withdrawn from around Kyiv. But the eastern regions of Kharkiv, Donetsk and Luhansk are seeing the worst of the fighting. Officials expect a large offensive in the east in the next two weeks. In the north, the scale of Bucha's killings becomes grimmer with each passing day, authorities still working to gather evidence of possible war crimes.

Officials said at least 410 civilians were killed in towns near the capital. A German news organization reported today that German intelligence intercepted Russian military radio conversations discussing the crimes and orders to kill civilians. That contradicts Russian claims the killings were staged.

But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov again didn't change his posture in an interview with Britain's Sky News.

Dmitry Peskov, Spokesman for Vladimir Putin: It's a bold fake. It's a bold fake, and we have been speaking about them for a couple of days. But no one would listen to us.

Man: We shall now begin the voting process.

Simon Ostrovsky: But citing reports of human rights abuses, today, the U.N. General Assembly voted to suspend Russia from the organization's human rights body.

Sergiy Kyslytsya, Ukrainian Ambassador to the United Nations: Russia is not only committing human rights violations. It is shaking the underpinnings of international peace and security.

The battle for the Donbas in eastern Ukraine will resemble the battles of the Second World War, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said at a press conference in Brussels following his participation in the NATO ministerial meeting on April 7.

""The battle for Donbas is underway,"" Kuleba said.

""It hasn't reached its maximum scale, but every day the heaviest fighting takes place in that part of Ukraine.""

""And more is to come, unfortunately,"" he said.
