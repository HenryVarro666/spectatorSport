Lviv, March 13

A Russian missile attack on a large Ukrainian military facility near the border with NATO member Poland on Sunday killed 35 people and wounded 134, a Ukrainian official said.

Britain said the incident, just 15 miles (25 km) from the Polish border, marked a “significant escalation” of the conflict. U.S. President Joe Biden has said NATO will defend every inch of its territory if Russia’s invasion of Ukraine spills over into member states of the Western defence alliance.

Ukraine said foreign military instructors have previously worked at the Yavoriv International Center for Peacekeeping and Security, but a NATO official said there were no personnel from the alliance there. It was not immediately clear whether any non-NATO states might have representatives there.

Regional governor Maksym Kozytskyy said Russian planes fired around 30 rockets at facility, adding that some were intercepted before they hit. At least 35 people were killed and 134 wounded, he said. Reuters was not able to verify his statement.

The 360 square-km (140 square-mile) facility is one Ukraine’s biggest and the largest in the western part of the country.

The Kremlin did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the reported missile strike so close to the border with NATO, and a short video briefing by Russia’s defence ministry spokesman on Sunday made no mention of such an attack.

Nineteen ambulances with sirens on were seen by Reuters driving from the direction of the Yaroviv facility after the reported strike and black smoke rose from the area.

“Russia has attacked the International Center for Peacekeeping & Security near Lviv. Foreign instructors work here. Information about the victims is being clarified,” Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said in an online post.

A Ukrainian defence ministry representative told Reuters the ministry was still trying to establish if any foreign instructors were at the centre at the time of the attack.

Ukraine, whose aspirations to join NATO are a major irritant to Russian President Vladimir Putin, held most of its drills with countries in the Western defence alliance at the base before the invasion. The last major exercises were in September.

In the weeks before Russia invaded on Feb. 24, the Ukrainian military trained there, but according to Ukrainian media, all foreign instructors left the training ground in mid-February, while leaving all the equipment.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, launched by Putin on Feb. 24, has sent more than 2.5 millions fleeing across borders and trapped thousands of people in besieged cities.

While Western nations have sought to isolate Putin by imposing harsh sanctions, the United States and its allies are concerned to avoid NATO being drawn into the conflict. “There are no NATO personnel in Ukraine,” the NATO official said, when asked if any NATO personnel were at the base.

Asked how much of an escalation the attack was, UK cabinet minister Michael Gove told a BBC interviewer: “It is significant.” Putin was pushing the boundaries in military terms, he said.

AIRPORT HIT IN WEST

The mayor of another city in western Ukraine, Ivano-Frankivsk, said Russian troops also continued to hit its airport, with no initial reports of casualties.

In eastern Ukraine, Russian troops are trying to surround Ukrainian forces as they advance from the port of Mariupol in the south and the second city Kharkiv in the north, the UK Defence Ministry said on Sunday.

Kharkhiv has suffered some of the heaviest bombardment.

Videos from one resident, Teimur Aliev, who is helping bring aid to residents, show bombed buildings lining streets, burned out cars riddled with shrapnel holes and debris strewn around.

“We will stitch up the wounds and the pain of our country and our city. We are ready to build it and we are ready to renew it when the war is over. We’re not going anywhere,” Aliev, a 23-year-old musician, said of his food distribution network, which now has dozens of volunteers.

British intelligence also said Russian forces advancing from Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, were trying to circumvent Mykolaiv as they look to drive west towards Odesa.

Air strikes on Mykolayiv killed nine people on Sunday, regional Governor Vitaliy Kim said in an online statement.

Air raid sirens again woke residents in Kyiv on Sunday morning, hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned Russian forces they face a fight to the death if they try to occupy the capital.

Ukraine accused Russian forces on Saturday of killing seven civilians, including one child, in an attack on women and children trying to flee fighting near Kyiv.

Reuters was unable immediately to verify the report and Russia offered no immediate comment.

Moscow denies targeting civilians. It blames Ukraine for failed attempts to evacuate civilians from encircled cities, an accusation Ukraine and its Western allies strongly reject.

MORE ARMS FOR UKRAINE

The United States said it would rush up to $200 million in additional small arms, anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons to Ukraine, where officials have pleaded for more military aid.

The Kremlin describes its actions as a “special operation” to demilitarise and “deNazify” Ukraine. Ukraine and Western allies call this a baseless pretext for a war of choice.

Polish President Andrzej Duda warned in an interview broadcast on Sunday that the use of chemical weapons in Ukraine by Russia would be a game changer and NATO would have to think seriously about how to respond.

Russian troops have destroyed 3,687 Ukrainian military infrastructure facilities so far, Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying on Sunday. It was not possible to independently verify his statement. Reuters

For the past two weeks since the Russians invaded, he's been barely sleeping, working 20 hours a day to feed the people of Russian-occupied Kherson. Each day, the 28-year-old bakes thousands of loaves of bread, loads them into his truck or car, and drives them through the deserted streets, delivering them to people who are increasingly being cut off from outside food supplies as Russian forces choke the city of nearly 300,000.

Kherson was the first major city to fall since the war began. Unified against a common enemy, Ukrainians are finding ways to resist — without even carrying a gun.

Before the war, Servetnyk was a successful chef — he won Ukrainian MasterChef in 2019, and ran a pizza restaurant in Kherson. But on Feb. 24, the Russians invaded Ukraine — and his life changed.

As the Russians shelled his country, Servetnyk and his partner drove to his parents' house in a village on the outskirts of Kherson, desperate to flee Ukraine. ""Get into the car, we will go somewhere,"" he told them. His parents — who had witnessed other periods of tumult in their lives — laughed. ""Where would we escape? Who is waiting for us there?"" he remembers them saying. ""The Russians are coming soon, they tell us that this is Russia now and we will go on with our lives.""

So Servetnyk decided to stay and resist. Many of Kherson's bakers had either fled or gone into hiding, so Servetynyk turned his pizza restaurant into a bakery, and began making thousands of loaves of bread. To feed more people, he also roped in other bakers and distributed their bread, too.

""We did not escape, did not leave, but rather started saving people as best as we could,"" he says.

Russia and Ukraine kept a fragile diplomatic path open with a new round of talks Monday even as Moscow's forces pounded away at Kyiv and other cities across the country in a punishing bombardment the Red Cross said has created “nothing short of a nightmare” for civilians.

Meanwhile, a convoy of 160 civilian cars left the encircled port city of Mariupol along a designated humanitarian route, the city council reported, in a rare glimmer of hope a week and a half into the lethal siege that has pulverized homes and other buildings and left people desperate for food, water, heat and medicine.

The latest negotiations, held via video conference, were the fourth round involving higher-level officials from the two countries and the first in a week. The talks ended without a breakthrough after several hours, with an aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying the negotiators took “a technical pause” and planned to meet again Tuesday.

The two sides had expressed some optimism in the past few days. Mykhailo Podolyak, the aide to Zelenskyy, tweeted that the negotiators would discuss “peace, ceasefire, immediate withdrawal of troops & security guarantees.”

Previous discussions, held in person in Belarus, produced no lasting humanitarian routes or agreements to end the fighting.

In Washington, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at a briefing Monday that while the Biden administration supports Ukraine’s participation in the talks with Russia, Russian President Vladimir Putin would have to show signs of de-escalating in order to demonstrate good faith.

“And what we’re really looking for is evidence of that, and we’re not seeing any evidence at this point that President Putin is doing anything to stop the onslaught or de-escalate,” she said.

Overall, nearly all of the Russian military offensives remained stalled after making little progress over the weekend, according to a senior U.S. defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the Pentagon's assessment. Russian troops were still about 15 kilometers (9 miles) from the center of Kyiv, the official said.

The official said that Russian forces have launched more than 900 missiles but that Ukraine's airspace is still contested, with Russia not achieving total air superiority.

Overnight, air raid alerts sounded in cities and towns around the country, from near the Russian border in the east to the Carpathian Mountains in the west, and fighting continued on the outskirts of Kyiv. Ukrainian officials said Russian forces shelled several suburbs of the capital.

Ukrainian authorities said two people were killed when the Russians struck an airplane factory in Kyiv, sparking a large fire. The Antonov factory is Ukraine’s largest aircraft plant and produces many of the world’s biggest cargo planes.

Russian artillery fire also hit a nine-story apartment building in the northern Obolonskyi district of the city, killing two more people, authorities said.

And a Russian airstrike near a Ukrainian checkpoint caused extensive damage to a downtown Kyiv neighborhood, killing one person, Ukraine's emergency agency said.

Kateryna Lot said she was in her apartment as her child did homework when they heard a loud explosion and ran to take shelter.

“The child became hysterical. Our windows and the balcony were shattered. Part of the floor fell down,” she said. “It was very, very scary.”

In an area outside Kyiv, Fox News reporter Benjamin Hall was injured while reporting and was hospitalized, the network said.

A town councilor for Brovary, east of Kyiv, was killed in fighting there, officials said. Shells also fell on the Kyiv suburbs of Irpin, Bucha and Hostomel, which have seen some of the worst fighting in Russia’s stalled attempt to take the capital, local authorities said.

Airstrikes were reported across the country, including the southern city of Mykolaiv, and the northern city of Chernihiv, where heat was knocked out to most of the town. Explosions also reverberated overnight around the Russian-occupied Black Sea port of Kherson.

Nine people were killed in a rocket attack on a TV tower in the western village of Antopol, according to the region's governor.

In the eastern city of Kharkiv, firefighters doused the smoldering remains of a four-story residential building. It was unclear whether there were casualties.

In the southern city of Mariupol, where the war has produced some of the greatest suffering, the city council didn’t say how many people were in the convoy of cars headed westward for the city of Zaporizhzhia. But it said a cease-fire along the route appeared to be holding.

Previous attempts to evacuate civilians and deliver humanitarian aid to the city of 430,000 were thwarted by continuing fighting.

Robert Mardini, director-general of the International Committee of the Red Cross , said the war has become “nothing short of a nightmare"" for those living in besieged cities, and he pleaded for safe corridors for civilians to leave and humanitarian aid to be brought in.

""The situation cannot, cannot continue like this,” he said. “History is watching what is happening in Mariupol and other cities.""

A pregnant woman who became a symbol of Ukraine’s suffering when she was photographed being carried from a bombed maternity hospital in Mariupol last week has died along with her baby, The Associated Press has learned.

Mariupol residents including Natalia Koldash rushed to shelter inside a building Sunday as an unidentified plane passed overhead.

“We have no information at all,” Koldash said. “We know nothing. It looks like we are living in a deep forest.""

Associated Press video showed debris from a damaged residential building and another building that a young man named Dima described as an elementary school.

“There was no military at this school,” he said. “It’s unclear why it was hit.”

The Russian military said 20 civilians in the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine were killed by a ballistic missile launched by Ukrainian forces. The claim could not be independently verified.

The U.N. has recorded at least 596 civilian deaths since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, though it believes the true toll is much higher. Millions more have fled their homes, with more than 2.8 million crossing into Poland and other neighboring countries in what the U.N. has called Europe’s biggest refugee crisis since World War II.

“All day crying from the pain of having to part with loved ones, with my husband, my parents,” 33-year-old refugee Alexandra Beltuygova said in the Polish border town of Przemysl after fleeing the industrial Ukrainian city of Dnipro.

“I understand that we may not see them. I wish this war would end,” she said.

Russia’s military is bigger and better equipped than Ukraine’s, but its troops have faced stiffer-than-expected resistance, bolstered by arms supplied by the West.

Two administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information, said China had signaled to Moscow that it would be willing to provide both military support in Ukraine and financial backing to help stave off the effects of Western sanctions.

The Kremlin has denied asking China for military equipment to use in Ukraine.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that “Russia has its own potential to continue the operation” and that it was “unfolding in accordance with the plan and will be completed on time and in full.”

The war expanded Sunday when Russian missiles pounded a military training base in western Ukraine, close to the Polish border, that previously served as a crucial hub for cooperation between Ukraine and NATO.

The attack killed 35 people, Ukrainian officials said, and raised fears that NATO could be drawn into direct conflict with Russia.

The senior U.S. defense official said the base was not being used at the time as a shipment site for U.S. military supplies to Ukraine.

Air raid sirens sounded Saturday in several cities, including the capital Kyiv, Odessa, Dnipro and Kharkiv, according to Ukrainian media.

More than two weeks after Moscow shocked the world by invading Ukraine, the United Nations and others said it may be committing war crimes in cities such as Mariupol, which for days has been under attack by Vladimir Putin's forces.

Survivors have been trying to flee Russian bombardment in a freezing city left without water or heating and running out of food. The situation is ""desperate,"" a Doctors Without Borders official said.

""Hundreds of thousands of people... are for all intents and purposes besieged,"" Stephen Cornish, one of those heading the medical charity's Ukraine operation, told AFP in an interview.

""Sieges are a medieval practice that have been outlawed by the modern rules of war for good reason.""

Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky said they were trying to arrange evacuations from besieged cities but Russian forces were disrupting efforts.

""Mariupol remains blocked by the enemy. Russian troops did not let our aid into the city and continue to torture our people, our Mariupol residents,"" Zelensky said in a video address late Friday.

""Tomorrow we'll try again. Once again, send food, water and medicine for our city.""

As Russia widens its bombardment and talks between Moscow and Kyiv seemingly go nowhere, Zelensky's pleas for NATO to intervene have grown increasingly desperate.

US President Joe Biden on Friday again ruled out direct action against nuclear-armed Russia, warning that it would lead to ""World War III"".

Instead, Washington added more layers of sanctions to those already crippling Russia's economy, this time ending normal trade relations and announcing a ban on signature Russian goods vodka, seafood and diamonds.

The United States and the European Union also suspended the export of their luxury goods to Russia.

""Putin must pay the price. He cannot pursue a war that threatens the very foundation of international peace and stability and then ask for help from the international community,"" Biden said from the White House.

He spoke as the United Nations said 2.5 million people had now fled Ukraine and around two million more had been internally displaced by the war.

'Nobody buries them'

Yulia, a 29-year-old teacher who fled Mariupol, said her mother-in-law was still there and told them ""the attacks don't stop"".

""There are many corpses on the street and nobody buries them,"" she told AFP.

In a video address released Saturday, Zelensky appealed to Russian mothers to prevent their sons from being sent to war.

""I want to say this once again to Russian mothers, especially mothers of conscripts. Do not send your children to war in a foreign country,"" he said.

Zelensky said more than 12,000 Russian troops had been killed in the invasion. US estimates put the number of Russian fatalities at 2,000 to 4,000 while Moscow's only official toll, announced last week, said 498 Russian troops had been killed.

In Ukraine's second city Kharkiv, doctors at a hospital described spending two days pumping ash from the stomach of an eight-year-old child whose home was blasted by a Russian missile.

""He still has cinders in his lungs,"" Dima Kasyanov's doctor told AFP.

Dnipro, an industrial hub of one million inhabitants, saw its image as a relatively safe haven shattered when three missiles hit civilian buildings Friday.

Images of its charred or destroyed buildings -- including a kindergarten with windows blown out -- now join those from Kharkiv and Mariupol as testimony to the brutal conflict.

""Today, we were supposed to host people who need a lot of support,"" said Svetlana Kalenecheko, who lives and works in a clinic that was damaged.

""Now we can't help anyone.""

The attacks on civilians prompted a new flurry of warnings from the Hague and the United Nations on Friday that Russia is committing war crimes.

""We are really heading towards an unimaginable tragedy,"" Cornish, of Doctors Without Borders, warned, insisting that ""there is still time to avoid it, and we must see it avoided"".

'Catastrophe'

Meanwhile, the Kremlin is slowly surrounding Kyiv, with Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak calling it a ""city under siege"".

He tweeted that it was ""ready to fight"", with checkpoints prepared and supply lines in place, adding: ""Kyiv will stand until the end"".

The Ukrainian military has said Russia is trying to take out Kyiv's defences to the north and west, where suburbs including Irpin and Bucha have already endured days of heavy bombardment.

Russian armoured vehicles are also advancing on the capital's northeast.

As the slow but steady advance continues, so has the tide of refugees.

About 100,000 people have been able to leave the northeastern city of Sumy, the eastern city of Izyum, and areas northwest of Kyiv in the past two days, Ukrainian officials said.

Zelensky warned living conditions were deteriorating fast.

""In the Sumy, Kyiv and Donetsk regions, there is no more electricity. Yes, there are problems with heating. There is no gas, no water,"" he said.

""It's a humanitarian catastrophe.""

'Murderers from Syria'

Foreign combatants have already entered the Ukrainian conflict on both sides, and on Friday, the Kremlin ramped up efforts to bring in reinforcements, particularly from Syria.

A furious Zelensky accused Russia of hiring ""murderers from Syria, a country where everything has been destroyed... like they are doing here to us"".

In southern Ukraine, Russian soldiers abducted the mayor of Melitopol, which Zelensky said was a ""sign of weakness"" and a ""crime against democracy"".

The global ripple effects of the conflict continued elsewhere.

Last-minute Russian demands related to the conflict threatened to derail the near-complete process of reviving the Iranian nuclear deal Friday.

And the fighting spurred vows to bolster the European Union's defences, with EU leaders describing the invasion as a wake-up call.

""There's no denying the fact that two weeks ago we woke up in a different Europe, in a different world,"" European Council chief Charles Michel said.

Russia also moved Friday to block Instagram and launch a criminal case against its owner Meta, as Moscow fired back at the tech giant for allowing posts calling for violence against Russian forces.

'We will not fight'

Talks have so far made no progress towards ending the fighting.

Putin has said negotiations were being held ""almost daily"", but US Vice President Kamala Harris, speaking in Bucharest, said the Russian leader had shown ""no sign of engaging in serious diplomacy"".

At the United Nations, Western countries accused Russia of spreading ""wild"" conspiracy theories after Moscow's envoy told diplomats that America and Ukraine had researched using bats to conduct biological warfare.

The US envoy said Russia had made the claims as part of a ""false flag effort"" for using chemical weapons of its own in Ukraine.

Biden warned Russia would pay a ""severe price"" if it used chemical weapons.

""We will not fight a war against Russia in Ukraine,"" he said.

The mayor of Irpin has spoken to the BBC about the ongoing plight of his city, which lies on the outskirts of the capital of Kyiv and has suffered heavy bombardment by Russian forces.

Speaking via a translator, Oleksandr Markushyn described the ""heavy, heavy shelling and bombardment going on"" throughout the city, with Russian forces hitting schools, residential areas and private homes - as well as the city's palace of culture.

He said daily evacuations were ongoing, but fraught with risk: ""I was participating in the evacuation of a column of around 100 people; it was the only safe place where we could evacuate people,"" he recalled, ""fifty metres in front of me there was a family - two kids, a husband and wife - and they were killed by a mine.

""Unfortunately these things are happening all the time, they are shooting at peaceful civilians. We were taking people out in vehicles and buses - it's not possible [allowed] to shoot civilians but they are doing that. This is barbaric, they are barbarous.""

He said there was no heating, mobile communications or water in the city currently. ""People are hiding in cellars, they use improvised stoves to warm themselves"" and rely on volunteers to help supply them with food.

""We continue evacuating people - we have been doing this today, we do this on a daily basis - but there are 5,000 -7,000 residents who want to stay. It's day 19 and we are holding on - and so the situation continues.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-60717902/page/2
5,2ef8af40-e1f9-4aeb-8844-9cc7c1ba391f,[],,"KYIV -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has threatened to break off talks with Moscow should Russian forces wipe out the remaining Ukrainian soldiers trapped in Mariupol as Moscow claimed it had taken control of the besieged and battered port city after a weeks-long battle.

The Russian Defense Ministry on April 16 said it had cleared the Mariupol urban area of Ukrainian troops and had trapped a few remaining fighters in the Azovstal steel plant, according to Russian state-run media.

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

A Russian Defense Ministry spokesman was quoted by Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency as saying that Ukrainian forces have lost a total of 4,000 troops during the long fight for the city -- a battle that has caught the world’s attention for its brutality.

Casualty figures from both sides have proved impossible to independently confirm during the conflict, which began with Russia's unprovoked invasion on February 24.

Ukraine has not commented on the latest Russian claims but in recent days has indicated the situation in Mariupol was desperate, with deaths mounting among the trapped civilian population and many experts predicting the city would soon fall to the Russians.

In an interview published earlier on April 16 with Ukrayinska Pravda, Zelenskiy warned Russia against committing atrocities against Ukrainian soldiers in the city.

""The elimination of our troops, of our men [in Mariupol] will put an end to any negotiations,” he said.

""That will bring an impasse as we don't negotiate on either our territories or our people,"" he added.

Peace talks have taken place between the two sides since Russia's invasion began, with little or no progress.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Reports early on April 16 said heavy fighting continued in several parts of Mariupol as Ukrainian troops attempted to fend off Russian soldiers who have been bolstered by reinforcements in recent days.

""The situation is very difficult [in Mariupol],"" Zelenskiy said early in the day. ""Our soldiers are blocked, the wounded are blocked. There is a humanitarian crisis.... Nevertheless, the guys are defending themselves.""

As the battle for the ruins of Mariupol appeared to be near its bloody end, air-raid sirens could be heard in many other parts of Ukraine on April 16, including in Kyiv, after Russia said it would seek revenge on the capital for what it claimed, without evidence, was Ukrainian targeting of Russian border towns.

Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said at least one person was killed and several others wounded in early morning attacks.

""For those Kyivites who left and are already thinking of heading back to return to the capital, I ask you to refrain from this and stay in safer places,"" Klitschko said in a message on his Telegram channel.

Russian troops have faced tougher-than-expected resistance -- both from the Ukrainian military and from ordinary citizens -- forcing them to retreat from areas in the north and to focus on eastern and southern regions of Ukraine, including Mariupol.

In his nightly address to the nation, Zelenskiy said the success of Ukraine's military and that of international sanctions against Russia will determine how long the war will last.

""The success of our military on the battlefield has been really significant. Historically significant. But it's still not enough to clear our land from the invading forces,"" he said.

""The sanctions against Russia are very serious, economically painful. But it is not enough to starve Russia's military machine. We need to promote stronger, more destructive sanctions. This will determine how long this war will last,"" he added.

Russia's warning to inflict more damage on Ukraine came a day after it suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, the Moskva, which sank while being towed to port on April 14 after suffering heavy damage under circumstances that remain in dispute.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on the Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

The National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) has rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Kyiv did claim, however, to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Meanwhile, the United States and its Western allies continued to pile pressure on Moscow over its campaign.

The German government said on April 15 that it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.



The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Russia's Foreign Ministry on April 16 said it was banning British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Foreign Minister Liz Truss, and several other cabinet ministers over British measures aimed at isolating Moscow and crippling the country's economy.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

The UN refugee agency said as of April 16 that 4,836,445 million Ukrainians had left the country since the Russian invasion -- up by 40,200 from the previous day’s total.

Kramer', 'Mike Ives', 'Alexandra Stevenson', 'John Yoon', 'Azi Paybarah', 'David Moll']",2022-03-03 00:00:00,"A fire broke out early Friday at a complex in southern Ukraine housing Europe’s largest nuclear power plant after Russian troops fired on the area, and the Russian military later took control of the site, Ukrainian officials said.

Security camera footage verified by The New York Times showed a building ablaze inside the Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex near a line of military vehicles. The videos appeared to show people in the vehicles firing at buildings in the power plant. Ukraine’s state emergency service later said the blaze went out after 6 a.m.

The fire did not affect essential equipment at the plant, the International Atomic Energy Agency said on Twitter, citing its communication with the Ukrainian government.

About an hour after dawn, Ukraine’s nuclear regulatory inspectorate said in a statement that Russian military forces were now occupying the complex. It said that all of the site’s power units remained intact and that no changes in radiation levels had been observed.

The fire broke out after a Russian attack on a training building outside the perimeter of the plant, according to a statement by Ukraine’s state emergency service. A spokesman for the nuclear plant, Andriy Tuz, was quoted by The Associated Press as telling Ukrainian television that shells had set fire to one of the plant’s six reactors that was under renovation and not operating.

Ukraine’s nuclear inspectorate later said in its statement that one unit of the six units was operating, another was in “outage,” two were being cooled down, and two others had been disconnected from the grid.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine had accused the Russian military of deliberately attacking the complex and said an explosion there would have been “the end for everybody, the end of Europe.”

“Only immediate actions by Europe could stop the Russian army,” he added.

President Biden spoke with Mr. Zelensky about the fire and joined him in urging Russia to “cease its military activities in the area and allow firefighters and emergency responders to access the site,” the White House said. Local reports later said that emergency crews had gained access.

Mr. Biden’s energy secretary, Jennifer M. Granholm, said on Twitter that the United States had not detected elevated radiation readings in the area, echoing an earlier assessment by the International Atomic Energy Agency. “The plant’s reactors are protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down,” she said.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain said he would seek an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council about the blaze at the complex, according to his office.

Before the fire was reported by Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, the director general for the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement that “a large number of Russian tanks and infantry” had entered Enerhodar, a town next to the plant. The director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said that troops were “moving directly” toward the reactor site.

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex, on the Dnieper River roughly a hundred miles north of Crimea, is the largest in Europe. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, its six reactors produce a total of 6,000 megawatts of electric power.

In comparison, the Chernobyl plant in northern Ukraine produced 3,800 megawatts — about a third less. (A megawatt, one million watts, is enough power to light 10,000 hundred-watt bulbs.) The four reactors of the Chernobyl complex were shut down after one suffered a catastrophic fire and meltdown in 1986.

The reactors’ cores are full of highly radioactive fuel. But an additional danger at the Zaporizhzhia site is the many acres of open pools of water behind the complex where spent fuel rods have been cooled for years. Experts fear that errant shells or missiles that hit such sites could set off radiological disasters.

For days, social media reports have detailed how the residents of Enerhodar set up a giant barrier of tires, vehicles and metal barricades to try to block a Russian advance into the city and the reactor site. Christoph Koettl, a visual investigator for The New York Times, noted on Twitter that the barricades were so large that they could be seen from outer space by orbiting satellites.

Starting this past Sunday, three days into the invasion, Ukraine’s nuclear regulator began reporting an unusual rate of disconnection: Six of the nation’s 15 reactors were offline. On Tuesday, the Zaporizhzhia facility was the site with the most reactors offline.

Heavy fighting between Ukrainian and Russian forces continues in multiple areas of Ukraine as of March 12, with Russian forces targeting populated areas with airstrikes and artillery fire despite French and German efforts to push Moscow to agree to a ceasefire. Russian forces have continued their intense shelling of Mariupol, notably targeting the vicinity of a mosque sheltering dozens of people, among other locations within the besieged city. Heavy clashes have also been reported in the outskirts of Kyiv, particularly to the northwest of the capital. Parts of the military column stalled to the north of Kyiv have begun to disperse, probably as part of a Russian attempt to reposition forces ahead of a likely offensive push to encircle the city within the coming days.

Russian forces have also notably continued to threaten the movement of people and goods through humanitarian corridors, with Ukrainian officials claiming Russian forces killed seven civilians attempting to escape armed clashes near the capital. The governor of Donetsk Region has leveled similar accusations against Russian forces, claiming that their continued attacks on humanitarian corridors have complicated the transport of aid into Mariupol. While Mariupol remains under Ukrainian control as of March 12, the city's mayor claims that the incessant, 12-day bombardment of the city has killed over 1,500 people; Ukrainian authorities have warned of a humanitarian catastrophe as basic goods become increasingly scarce.

More than 2,000 residents of the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol, Zaporizhzhia Region, protested Russian forces' alleged kidnapping of the city's mayor, demanding his release March 12. The incident highlights Russian forces' apparent difficulty in enforcing order in some cities under their occupation.

The Russian military offensive has expanded in its geographic scope in recent days, with missile strikes now targeting cities in central and western Ukraine. At least three missiles struck a military airfield in the northwestern city of Lutsk March 11, killing four soldiers. Missiles also struck an airfield and other locations in the western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, as well as several locations in the central city of Dnipro early March 11.

Fighting continues to take place to the west, northwest, and east of Kyiv. Additionally, intense bombardments have continued in the eastern city of Kharkiv and in settlements to the south of the city, including Izyum. Rocket strikes and artillery shelling have also been reported in and around Chernihiv, Sumy, and Mariupol as of March 12.

Russian troops have encircled or partially encircled the cities of Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, Chernihiv, Mariupol, Polohy, Enerhodar, and Sumy. Kherson, Melitopol, and Berdyansk are under Russian occupation.

According to figures released by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, at least 579 civilians have been killed and more than 1,000 others wounded since Russia's offensive against Ukraine began Feb. 24.

Martial Law, Curfews, Disruptions

Martial law and a nationwide general military mobilization are in effect. Males ages 18-60 are prohibited from leaving the country. Curfews are in effect 22:00-06:00 in multiple regions, including Cherkasy, Lviv, Poltava, Vinnytsia, Volyn, Zaporizhzhia, and Zhytomyr. Curfew hours are 18:00-06:00 in Chernihiv and Kharkiv, 19:00-06:00 in Odesa and Mykolaiv, 20:00-06:00 in Dnipro and Kherson, 20:00-07:00 in Kyiv, and 22:00-07:00 in Ivano-Frankivsk. Depending on the ground situation, authorities may extend or amend curfew hours on short notice. Civilians must stay indoors during curfew hours; exemptions are in place for persons seeking urgent medical care and workers in critical infrastructure. Public transport is unavailable during curfew hours.

Reports indicate a shortage of basic supplies, including groceries and pharmaceutical products, in Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Polohy, and Mariupol; similar situations are likely in other cities facing Russian ground offensives. Other conflict-ridden cities will likely continue to see queues at ATMs, supermarkets, and petrol stations, as well as significant traffic congestion on major westward roads.

Ukrainian authorities have closed the country's borders with Belarus, Russia, and the Transnistria region of Moldova to foreign nationals; only Ukrainian citizens can enter from these areas. Reports also indicate significant road travel disruptions at Ukraine's western borders as thousands of civilians flee the conflict, though congestion has reportedly eased. Ukraine's borders with Hungary, Moldova, Poland, and Slovakia remain open; these states have increased security at their respective borders with Ukraine to aid in the reception of refugees. Significant delays at border crossings into neighboring states will likely persist and may worsen depending on conflict developments elsewhere in the country.

Critical Infrastructure

Metro services in Kyiv are intermittent; trains do not operate during curfew hours and will likely cease during air raids as many stations function as bomb shelters. Rail and road routes to the south and west of Kyiv remain largely operational, though the railway connection between Kyiv and Irpen was destroyed March 5. Civilian aviation remains suspended in Ukraine, and the nation's seaports are closed. Russia has temporarily stopped commercial shipping in the Sea of Azov.

Slovakia has resumed international rail services with Ukraine. Ukrainian Railways (UZ) is currently operating evacuation trains from multiple regions, including Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kryvyi Rih, Zakarpattia, Zaporizhzhia, and Odesa regions. UZ continues to operate intermittent services throughout much of the country, though reports indicate severe delays and congestion. Rail services are subject to disruptions with little warning. Reports indicate large crowds at several operational stations, particularly in Lviv, from where evacuation services to international destinations are coordinated.

Intermittent telecommunications and internet disruptions continue across much of the country. Power, water, gas, and other utilities or amenities have been disrupted throughout Sumy Region, as well as in Okhtyrka, Mariupol, and Kharkiv. Similar utility disruptions are highly likely in other urban centers facing artillery and rocket bombardment.

The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) only allows the withdrawal of up to UAH 30,000 (USD 1,000) in cash from foreign currency accounts. It has limited the permitted cash withdrawal from domestic currency accounts to UAH 100,000 (USD 3,340) per day. The bank has also suspended cross-border currency payments and the replenishment of electronic wallets.

Context

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asserted March 12 that Moscow could only take Kyiv if it ""razes the city to the ground,"" indicating that Ukrainian leadership is unlikely to voluntarily submit to an agreement that surrenders the capital city to the Russian military. Zelensky, however, has said that he is open to discussions with Russian President Vladimir Putin, possibly in Jerusalem with the mediation of Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett.

The foreign ministers of Ukraine and Russia met in Antalya, Turkey, March 10, but failed to agree to a 24-hour ceasefire or on humanitarian relief for Mariupol during their meeting. Ukraine continues to demand a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian forces, while Russia demands that Ukraine surrender, disarm, and declare itself to be a neutral country remaining outside NATO and the EU.

In the southeast, Russian forces are reportedly moving northward from Melitopol and Polohy, and may approach Zaporizhzhia in the coming days. Russia may also attempt further advances in the Mykolaiv and Kherson regions; further advances to the west of Mykolaiv toward Odesa threaten to cut Ukraine off from supplies via the Black Sea.

Advice

Avoid travel to Ukraine until the situation stabilizes; consider exiting the country if safe to do so. Where fighting or airstrikes are occurring, shelter in place until the situation becomes clear. If officials report incoming fire, stay away from windows and exterior walls. Strictly heed the instructions of local security personnel, particularly when ordered to air-raid shelters. Stockpile food, fuel, and water when possible and safe to do so. Maintain contact with your diplomatic representation. Confirm that a thorough communication plan exists to ensure rapid accountability for all personnel operating in Ukraine. Reconfirm the status of public transport services, road routes, and borders before departure.

War in Ukraine takes centre stage at Hungary’s election rallies

The war in Ukraine has taken centre stage in Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s election campaign as the populist leader attempts to win a fourth consecutive term.

“It is in our interests to not be a sacrificial pawn in someone else’s war. We can’t win anything in this war, but we have everything to lose,” Orban said.

Hungary has sought to balance its fraught relationship with its allies in the European Union and the NATO military alliance with its close ties to Russia.

Orban has agreed to back the sanctions imposed on Russia by the EU and condemned Moscow’s violent assault on Ukraine.

Biden signs budget bill providing additional aid to Ukraine

US President Joe Biden has signed a bill providing $13.6bn in additional military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine as part of a $1.5 trillion government spending measure.

“Putin’s aggression against Ukraine has uniting people all across America, united our two parties in Congress, and united the freedom loving world,” Biden said.

Roughly half the $13.6bn will arm Ukraine and cover the Pentagon’s costs for sending US troops to other Eastern European nations that might see the war spill past their borders. Much of the rest will be allocated to humanitarian and economic assistance, strengthening regional allies’ defences and protecting their energy supplies and cybersecurity needs.

Ukraine tells IAEA Russia preventing it from answering Chernobyl questions

The Ukrainian nuclear regulator has informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that it is unable to provide information on radioactive waste facilities at Chernobyl due to Russian control of the site.

“The regulator said for the first time today that information it received regarding Chornobyl was ‘controlled by the Russian military forces’ and therefore it could not ‘always provide detailed answers to all’ of the IAEA’s questions,” the IAEA said in a statement, adding that was also the case at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.

The Take podcast: Is Russia’s Syria playbook being used in Ukraine?

This week marks the anniversary of Syria’s uprising and there still seems to be no end to conflict in sight. There’s also another date that resonates: September 30, 2015, when Russia intervened on behalf of President Bashar al-Assad’s government.

Russia said it tested at least 320 new types of weapons in Syria, some of which are now in use in the war in Ukraine, and it is using tactics that seem to come from what’s been called “the Syria playbook.”

We look at how the people all too familiar with that playbook see Syria’s story in Ukraine.

Zelenskyy urges no-fly zone in address to Canada’s parliament

Ukraine needs a no-fly zone to stop Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities and towns, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has told Canada’s parliament, as Western leaders continue to rule out directly intervening in the conflict.

Addressing the House of Commons in Ottawa via video on Tuesday morning, Zelenskyy said Ukraine has experienced 20 days of “full-scale aggression” by Russia.

“Can you imagine when you call your [allies], and you ask please close the sky, close the airspace, please stop the bombings, how many more cruise missiles have to fall on our cities until you make this happen? And in return they express their deep concerns about the situation,” he said.

“Please understand how important it is for us to close our airspace from Russian missiles and Russian aircraft. I hope you can understand.”

Speaking at a news conference in advance a meeting of defence ministers in Brussels, Stoltenberg said “NATO’s core task is to protect and defend all allies.”

“There is always a risk for incidents and accidents – if they happen we have to make sure that they don’t spiral out of control,” he said.

A Russian raid on a Ukrainian military base less than 25km (15 miles) from the Polish border on Sunday has raised concerns of an accidental attack on a NATO member.

Russia drafting thousands in Syria for Ukraine war: Monitor

Russia has drawn up lists of fighters from the Syrian army and allied militias to be put on standby for deployment in Ukraine, according to a war monitor.

Rami Abdel Rahman, who heads the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said “more than 40,000 Syrians have registered to fight alongside Russia in Ukraine so far.”

Russia has promised Syrian soldiers, who earn between $15 and $35 per month, a salary of $1,100 to fight in Ukraine, the Observatory reported. They are also entitled to $7,700 in compensation for injuries and their families to $16,500 if they are killed in combat.

Belarus resisting attempts to drag it into Ukraine conflict: Lukashenko

President Alexander Lukashenko has said Belarus intercepted a missile fired at it two days ago from Ukraine, but that it would resist what he called attempts to draw it into the conflict across the border.

The Kyiv government accused Russia on Friday of staging “false flag” air attacks on Belarus from Ukraine to provide an excuse for Moscow’s close ally, which has served as a staging post for Russian forces, to join the conflict.

“I want to emphasise again … We are not going to become involved in this operation that Russia is conducting in Ukraine,” Lukashenko told Belarusian soldiers, according to the state news agency BelTA.

An adviser to President Zelenskyy has said that even in the worst-case scenario the war with Russia may end by mid-April.

“The second [solution] is if Russia gets more reserves, understanding that they will not reach an agreement with us now. And then there will be another attempt to attack Ukraine.

China in ‘tough spot’ amid Russia’s reported request for aid: Analyst

Brett Bruen, a former Obama administration official, says Russia’s invasion of Ukraine poses both risks and opportunities for China.

“China is in a tough spot at the moment because on the one hand, they see an opportunity with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to weaken the West and try to reorder the international order. But at the same time, there’s a whole number of risks … both economic and security,” he told Al Jazeera.

“The fact that this invasion has not gone according to plan is certainly concerning for Beijing and that is going to weigh heavily on their next move.

“China was fine to go along if this was going to be a quick and relatively easy invasion. The more complicated it gets, the more it complicates China’s position. What the Americans are doing right now is to publicly put that pressure on Beijing to force them into making a decision. And I think the near unanimity in the international community on this makes it even more challenging for Beijing to be an outlier.”

Putin unlikely to provoke NATO to enter war: US analyst

Russia President Vladimir Putin is unlikely to provoke NATO forces to enter the war in Ukraine as Russian forces continue to suffer logistics and organisational failures, said Lauren Speranza, a director at the Center for European Policy Analysis in Washington, DC.

“I do think he would be hesitant to actually fully escalate this war to bring in NATO,” Speranza told Al Jazeera. “There is no successful political or military endgame for Russia.”

A war involving NATO “would be disastrous for Mr Putin, perhaps even more so than the war that’s already going on in Ukraine”, she added.

Can the UAE be a safe haven for Russia’s oligarchs?

The United Arab Emirates (UAE), and in particular, the emirate of Dubai, has a reputation for being a playground for the rich, and one that does not ask too many questions about how wealth has been obtained.

That looks likely to continue, despite increasing Western pressure to squeeze Russia financially – turning the UAE into an even more attractive proposition for rich Russians seeking a safe haven for their wealth and undermining the effort to force Russia to pull back from its invasion of Ukraine.
