Russia trades accusation with US, UK about chemical weapons in Ukraine

Russia has traded accusations with the United States and Britain at the United Nations over the possibility of a chemical weapons attack in Ukraine.

The comments were made by diplomats to reporters after Russia raised the issue of an ammonia leak in Ukraine’s besieged northeastern city of Sumy, blaming “Ukrainian radical nationalist groups,” during a closed-door UN Security Council meeting.

It was the third time Russia raised the issue of biological or chemical weapons since it began its invasion of Ukraine. “This might well be a prelude to the Russians themselves creating some sort of false flag chemical weapons attack,” Britain’s UN Ambassador Barbara Woodward told reporters.

Russia would only use nuclear weapons if its existence were threatened: Kremlin

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has told CNN in an interview that Russia would only use nuclear weapons if its very existence were threatened.

“We have a concept of domestic security and it’s public, you can read all the reasons for nuclear arms to be used. So if it is an existential threat for our country, then it [the nuclear arsenal] can be used in accordance with our concept,” he said.

The comment came amid Western concern that the conflict could escalate into a nuclear war after President Vladimir Putin last month ordered Russia’s nuclear forces to be put on high alert.

WFP says ‘it’s going to be hell on earth’ if food production in Ukraine fails to resume

“If we don’t act now, strategically and quickly, it’s going to be hell on earth,” David Beasley said in Brussels.

Beasley added that, before the Russian invasion, the UN agency was already cutting 8 million people to 50 percent rations in Yemen, Niger, Chad and other countries due to rising costs.

“Now we’ll have a supply issue because Ukraine and Russia produce between 20 and 30 percent of all the grain in the world,” he said.

US condemns Navalny conviction as attempt to silence opposition in Russia

The United States has condemned a Russian court verdict that found jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny guilty of additional charges, saying it was an attempt to silence him and distract him from the invasion of Ukraine.

“The court’s sham ruling is the latest in a series of attempts to silence Navalny,” State Department spokesman Ned Price said.

“This disturbing decision… is another example of the Russian government’s widening crackdown on dissent and freedom of expression, which is intended to hide the Kremlin’s brutal war, and unprovoked war against Ukraine.”

“So far the situation is calm. We have not seen any movement towards escalation,” Popescu said at the European parliament.

“We as a government cannot rule out any options and must consider the full range of scenarios for the development of events including negative ones.”

Transdniestria is a narrow strip of land held by pro-Russian separatists that runs along the east of Moldova, about 40 kilometres of the Ukrainian port of Odesa. Russian troops are stationed there, despite repeated calls for them to leave.

Russia ‘failed’ to achieve objectives in Ukraine, US says

Russia has failed to achieve its goals in Ukraine, Sullivan has said, stressing that Moscow will “never take the country away from the Ukrainian people”.

Biden’s national security adviser told reporters at the White House that Russia had set three “basic” objectives for itself when it started the invasion: subjugating Ukraine, enhancing Moscow’s power and prestige, and dividing the West.

“Russia has thus far manifestly failed to accomplish all three objectives. In fact, it has thus far achieved the opposite,” the top aide said.

Still, Sullivan predicted that violence will get worse in the coming days, warning that the war will not end easily.

Hungary asks for EU funds amid refugee crisis

Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban has asked the European Commission to disburse all European Union funds allocated to the country including a loan under the Recovery and Resilience Facility to help handle the Ukrainian refugee crisis, his press chief has said.

Orban said Hungary wanted to use the loan facility for defence, border control, and humanitarian and other acute crisis management tasks, according to a copy of a letter seen by Reuters.

The European Commission has been withholding its approval to pay out pandemic recovery money to Poland and Hungary because the two countries have yet to address EU recommendations on the rule of law, including press freedoms and LGBT rights.

No indication of imminent Russian chemical attack in Ukraine: US defence official

The United States has not yet seen any concrete indication of an imminent Russian chemical or biological weapons attack in Ukraine but is closely monitoring intelligence, a senior US defence official has said.

The comment comes after President Joe Biden said Russia’s accusations that Kyiv has biological and chemical weapons suggest Moscow is considering using them in the war against Ukraine.

James Elder, a UNICEF spokesman, has described the number of children whose lives have been uprooted by Russia’s invasion as “mind-boggling”.

He said each case signified a child likely “separated from their dad” and a “family split apart”.

“It’s probably a child … who was going to school a month ago but has now had their life turned upside down,” Elder added. “It is torturous.”

Refugee crisis straining Moldova’s healthcare system, minister says

Moldova’s health minister says his country has appealed for help from the European Union and UN agencies as it struggles to deal with the pressure the arrival of hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees has put on its healthcare system.

More than 331,000 refugees have entered Moldova since Russia invaded Ukraine, and 100,000 remain in the country, Ala Nemerenco told a joint news conference with the World Health Organization (WHO) streamed live from the country’s capital, Chisinau.

“Obviously the resources of the country are limited and we wouldn’t want this to affect or become a burden for the citizens of the Republic of Moldova,” Nemerenco said.

“That is why we have addressed all our partners to ask for support in this situation,” she added. “Unfortunately these events without any precedent here are really very serious and put our health system under very big pressure.”

Moldova, a small former Soviet republic sandwiched between Ukraine and EU member state Romania, is one of Europe’s poorest countries.

‘We are on the brink of survival,’ Zelenskyy tells Italian parliament

Ukraine’s president has told the Italian parliament that his country is on the brink of surviving its war with Russian forces but warned Moscow was intent on breaking through his country to the rest of Europe.

“For Russian troops, Ukraine is the gates of Europe, where they want to break in, but barbarism must not be allowed to pass,” Zelenskyy said via video link.

He also reiterated earlier calls for more sanctions to be imposed on Russia over its offensive and cautioned the consequences of the war were already being felt in other parts of the world.

“The most terrible thing will be the famine that is approaching for some countries. Ukraine has always been one of the largest food exporters, but how can we sow [crops] under the strikes of Russian artillery?” Zelenskyy said.

Countries such as Lebanon, Egypt, Yemen and others have come to rely on Ukrainian wheat in recent years and the conflict has caused wheat prices to skyrocket – rising by 50 percent in the last month.

Mariupol witnessing ‘an increasingly grim struggle’ for control: AJE correspondent

Al Jazeera’s Rob McBride, reporting from the city of Lviv, in western Ukraine, says Mariupol remains the “focus” of the war in Ukraine as Russia’s assault moves towards the end of its fourth week.

“It is the scene of an increasingly grim struggle between Russian forces who are seemingly determined to take it at any cost, and regardless of what it looks like if and when they do take it, and equally determined Ukrainian defenders who want to deny them the city,” McBride said.

“The latest reports and … pictures [from Mariupol] bear that out, and show the deteriorating situation of the population, who are still trying to exist amid all of this,” he added.

“There are bodies lying in the streets, and sometimes bodies being buried in shallow graves close to apartment blocks … local people chopping down trees for firewood and makeshift stoves outdoors – it is all very grim.

“This was until just a few weeks ago a thriving city of 430,000 people, it is now thought there are about 300,000 people still in the city in an increasingly desperate situation.”

It did not specify how much of the area quoted was classified as containing explosive devices prior to Russia’s invasion beginning and said its calculations were preliminary, based on information calculations made jointly with the Ukrainian mine action operator Demining Solutions.

Russian athlete loses Speedo deal after attending Putin rally

Swimwear maker Speedo has ended its sponsorship with Russia’s double Olympic swimming champion Evgeny Rylov after he attended a rally hosted by Putin in Moscow last week, according to the Olympics news website insidethegames.biz.

Rylov, who won gold in 100 metres and 200 metres backstroke events at last year’s Tokyo Olympics, was among eight athletes identified at the rally last Friday, insidethegames said.

“Following his attendance at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow at the weekend, Speedo can confirm that it has terminated the sponsorship of Rylov with immediate effect,” insidethegames quoted Speedo as saying in a statement.

“We condemn the war in Ukraine in the strongest possible way and stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine, our athletes and our team mates who have been impacted by the conflict.”

Days after Russian swimmer Evgeny Rylov appeared at a pro-war rally in Moscow, @speedo is ending its endorsement contract with the 2-time Olympic gold medallist.

Divide at UN over naming Russia in Ukraine aid resolution

France and Mexico are pressing members of the UN to mention Russia’s invasion in a resolution on the worsening humanitarian situation in Ukraine.

But South Africa is arguing against that approach, saying that inserting political issues may block consensus on helping civilians.

A French-Mexican draft resolution expected to be voted on this week in the 193-nation UN General Assembly makes clear that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is responsible for its humanitarian crisis.

A rival South African draft resolution circulated late Monday makes no mention of Russia, referring instead to “all parties”.

Unlike the Security Council, there are no vetoes in the General Assembly. But assembly resolutions are not legally binding, as Security Council resolutions are, though they do have clout in reflecting world opinion.

Russia carried out 300 aircraft sorties over Ukraine in past 24 hours: US official

A senior US defence official says the Russians have increased the number of military aircraft sorties over Ukraine over the past two days, doing as many as 300 in the last 24 hours.

But Russia still does not have air superiority over the country yet.

The official said Ukraine has also increased the pace of its military flights, but declined to provide numbers.

The official said that most of the military flights involve air-to-ground strikes, mainly on stationary targets, and that the Russian aircraft are not spending a lot of time in Ukrainian airspace. The Ukraine military has continued to use its short and long-range air defence systems and drones to target Russian aircraft.

The Russians have also increased naval activity in the northern Black Sea, but there are no indications at this point of an amphibious assault on Odesa. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the military’s assessment.

“They are also suggesting that Ukraine has biological and chemical weapons in Ukraine. That’s a clear sign he’s considering using both of those.”

Ukraine war exposes cracks in US ties to Middle East allies

With Russia’s invasion of Ukraine dominating discussions around the world, the Biden administration has been promoting global unity against what it calls Putin’s “war of choice”.

But despite those efforts, the conflict has highlighted cracks in some of the US’s most prominent alliances in the Middle East, notably with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia.

The UAE and Saudi Arabia appear to be sending a message to the US, Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a Middle East fellow at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy, told Al Jazeera: “’We’re going to act upon our interests and not what you think our interests are.’”
