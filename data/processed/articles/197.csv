'Everyone is doing what they can to defend our city, our country'

Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, beginning a war that, to some Ukrainians, felt improbable until the first explosions went off. The resistance effort was immediate.

On February 25, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged citizens across the country to mobilise against Russia’s full-scale invasion. Thousands of people lined up to enlist in the military.

Meanwhile, everyday citizens were told to take up arms to defend their cities. The Ukrainian defence ministry encouraged residents of a Kyiv suburb to “make Molotov cocktails” and “destroy the occupier”.

Analysts say the Russian military may have been caught off guard by Ukraine’s strong resistance. Bodia told us that everyone has become involved in the war effort.

Children, from the age of seven, are busy making molotov cocktails. Old women and restaurants are cooking food for soldiers. Civilians are signing up to fight. Everyone is involved, doing what they can to help, to defend our city, our country.

'The Russians could arrive at any moment'

With the invasion now in its second week, Russian troops and tanks are still outside the capital – but maybe not for long.

The situation in Kyiv has been calm for the last few days, there’s a mix of silence and sirens, with explosions going off every hour or so. We know that the Russians could arrive at any moment, but we don’t know when. So we are preparing ourselves, we are getting ready to fight. When we go out to buy more metal, we see massive lines in front of every shop and pharmacy. Checkpoints are everywhere. This is a capital, it is usually full of life, but right now, it feels dead.

'We want to stay here until we achieve victory'

While thousands of Kyiv residents have packed their suitcases and left looking for safety elsewhere, many, like Bodia, refuse to leave and vow to defend the capital.

If we wanted to leave Kyiv we could flee at any time. But we don’t want to. There are people here who need our help so we can’t leave. We want to stay here and defend our city until the very last minute. Until victory.

More than one million civilians have fled Ukraine because of the Russian invasion, according to the United Nations.

Meanwhile, around 160,000 people in Ukraine who have fled the war are displaced within the country.

Security measures were tightened around the main streets in Ukraine's capital Kyiv as the Russia-Ukraine war entered its eighth day on Thursday.

Around Maidan Nezalezhnosti, the iconic central Independence Square of Kyiv located on Khreshchatyk Street in the Shevchenko region, a number of armed soldiers were seen patrolling the makeshift checkpoints on the streets.

Piles of sand, sandbag barricades used for blocking roads, wooden crates, and bricks piled high along with the Czech hedgehog tank barriers and concrete columns were placed on the main streets of Kyiv, a city of 3 million people, as part of the measures.

Ukrainians have been using old cars and big metal garbage carts to erect barricades and improvised checkpoints to block the roads amid Russian attacks.

They have also been digging deep trenches and erecting barriers with giant truck tires topped with sand, with a blue-yellow national flag waving above them.

While similar checkpoints were seen across the entire city, main bridges except a few have been closed to traffic.

Vehicles are stopped at the checkpoints for ID and documents check-up by a mixture of armed volunteers of the Territorial Defense structure, active police officers, and Ukrainian soldiers who guard these barricades.

Some checkpoints are also guarded with armored military vehicles with a cannon, mainly covered by a green camouflage tarpaulin.

Kyiv is under curfew from 5 p.m. to 8 a.m. local time (1500 to 0600GMT) every day to ensure the safety of people and more effective defense from Russian forces and sabotage groups.

Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Wednesday on Day 28:

Russian troops face major setback east of Kyiv and moving into defensive positions

In a significant movement, Ukraine's military forces have pushed back Russian forces east of Kyiv to 55 kilometers from the city center, according to a senior defense official.

For weeks, and as recently as Tuesday, Russian forces have been kept at bay approximately 20 to 30 kilometers from the center of the capital city.

The official said that Ukrainian forces near Bovary ""have been able to push the Russians back to about 55 kilometers east and northeast of Kyiv.""

The ability to push back Russian forces nearly twice as far as where they had been for weeks is in line with what the official had said on Tuesday were indications that in some areas Ukrainian forces were attempting to retake territory taken by Russia. ""Ukrainians are not only in some of these places up sufficiently defending they're going on the offense in some of these places and actually pushing the Russians backwards, or in the case of Kiev, they're, they're basically forcing them into a defensive position,"" the official said Wednesday.

The U.S. now assesses that Russian troops that have been stalled 12 to 15 kilometers north of the city are ""digging in"" and establishing defensive positions according to the official. ""They're forcing them into a defensive position"" the official told reporters on Wednesday. ""So it's not that they're not advancing, they're actually not trying to advance right now,"" said the official. ""They're taking more defensive positions.""

""We're starting to see him sort of dig in around Kyiv but really trying to go more on the offense than they have been, more energy applied, in that eastern part of Ukraine"" said the official.

Ukrainians pushing back Russian troops in Cherniviv

Meanwhile, Ukrainian troops in the city of Chernihiv, northeast of Kyiv, have also succeeded in slightly pushing back some of the Russian forces that have surrounded the city for weeks. The official described Ukrainians forces there as continuing to fight ""very hard"" against Russian forces to keep them out of the city and in some cases Russian troops have been ""ceding ground."" ""They are actually moving in the opposite direction, but not by much,"" the official said of Russian forces around the city.

Russian troops now prioritizing operations in eastern Ukraine's Donbass region

The official said Russia appears to be ""starting to prioritize"" their operations in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine, particularly around Luhansk, to cut off Ukraine's military that has been fighting there against Russian separatists for the past eight years. ""We still believe that the Russians are trying to basically cut it off and therefore pin down Ukrainian forces that are that are in the Luhansk, Donetsk area,"" said the official.

""What we're seeing now is indications that the Russians are really starting to prioritize that part of eastern Ukraine,"" said the official. ""We believe that they are now going to start to apply, actually, they have applied a lot more energy in the Luhansk, Donetsk area, particularly around Luhansk. You're seeing them really put more energy and effort into that part of Ukraine.""

The official has previously said that it appears that the Russian forces fighting to take over the southern port city of Mariupol so they can then push north into the Donbass to cut off the Ukrainian military. Meanwhile, the fighting in that city remains ""very very contested"" according to the official who also described the fighting there between Russian and Ukrainian troops as being ""hardcore."" The official noted that Russian forces continue to heavily bombard the city with artillery and long range missile fire.

Meanwhile, it appears that recent Russian military activity around the western port city of Odessa that led to speculation of an attack on the city may have been a feint intended to ""pin down Ukrainian forces."" ""It's not entirely it's not entirely obvious that they actually will make a move on Odessa,"" said the official. ""So we're just we're just kind of watching that to see to see where it goes.""

More US troops going forward to eastern Europe?

The official said that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is always assessing the U.S. military presence in eastern Europe and has not ""taken off the table"" the possibility ""that he will flow more forces in from the United States or reposition from elsewhere in Europe.""

But for now there are no announcements to make said the official who added that it's unclear what the U.S. military posture in eastern Europe will look like going forward. ""Certainly, the security environment in Europe is different now. And it will be different that it will be different no matter what the outcome is of this war,"" said the official.

""I think it's safe to say that the United States as well as other NATO nations will be taken a hard look at what it whether we have the footprint right and whether the posture is appropriate to the new security environment that results from all this,"" the official said.

Russia has lots of missiles left to use

According to the official, Russia has now launched more than 1,200 missiles into Ukraine, but ""we still assess that they have the vast majority of their of their assembled available inventory of surface to air missiles and cruise missiles available to them."" Though the Russian military has expended a lot of the missile inventory readied for operations in Ukraine the official noted that ""they still have an awful lot left.""

The official said that Russia's military is ""running the lowest on our air launched cruise missiles"" but that they still have ""over 50% of what they had assembled prior to the invasion. But they still have a significant number of ground launched cruise missiles, short range ballistic missiles, and medium range ballistic missiles.",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ukraines-military-forces-russian-troops-east-kyiv-back/story?id=83631494
5,6259ef85-29e2-4d64-a662-712410c85434,['Sam Mednick'],2022-03-23 00:00:00.000,"‘There’s two ways to deal with the war: one way is just to sit and wait, the other is to fight.’

Kyiv, Ukraine – Dmytro Moskalenko was 12 years old, the same age his son is today, when the Soviet Union collapsed three decades ago. Now, he fears his child will be thrown into a world he never wants to return to.

“I don’t want him to live in Soviet Union 2.0 … I want him to live in a free democratic country,” says the 43-year-old father who goes by the name Dima. He is sitting in a small cafe in Kyiv as Russian ground troops encircle his city and planes attack from the sky.

After nearly two decades working for a Western embassy in the Ukrainian capital, he left his job to become a soldier just days after Russia invaded at the end of February.

The soft-spoken Dima is nostalgic, and at times emotional, choking back tears and pausing to collect himself mid-conversation as he recounts the last three weeks of his life.

“I did not believe until the last moment that Putin would invade,” he says. “I really thought that he would never do such a crime [in the] geographical centre of Europe in the 21st century. But unfortunately, I was wrong.”

Dima is one of reportedly tens of thousands of people across Ukraine who have traded in their suits and laptops for army fatigues and AK-47s, joining the Territorial Defence Forces – volunteer military units of the armed forces – to try and stave off Russian troops.

The Ukrainian government has barred men between the ages of 18 and 60, with a few exceptions, from leaving the country, forcing them to stay and fight or help the war effort in other ways. Many, like Dima, have never fought before; the minimal military training they’ve had was when they were in school. But most say that even if they hadn’t been made to stay, they would have chosen to.

The numbers wanting to take up arms to defend Ukraine have been so overwhelming that many told Al Jazeera they were turned away because units were full. Some remain on waiting lists.

Ukraine’s army – which numbered some 240,000 soldiers before the start of the war – has held up against Russian forces longer than expected. However, the war is intensifying, as Russia, which is accused of potential war crimes, targets civilians and hospitals and decimates and cuts off towns. At least 925 civilians have been killed according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, but the true number is likely higher. Nearly 10 million people (PDF) have been displaced, some 3.5 million to neighbouring countries, in what the UN has called the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since the second world war.

The ground offensive towards Kyiv had slowed after the initial invasion as Russian convoys stalled approximately 15 to 30 kilometres (nine to 18 miles) to the northwest and east of the city. But air attacks have escalated in recent days, several buildings have been hit by rockets, and people have been killed.

Strolling through downtown Kyiv with his colleagues – on one of the few occasions that he’s been allowed to leave the military base since joining – Dima points to the buildings and neighbourhoods where he went to school, played with friends and lived with his parents and sister, landmarks now reminiscent of another life.

Before the invasion, Kyiv was the busiest city in Ukraine, hosting concerts and exhibits and boasting a vibrant nightlife. The now-fortified capital of some three million people has largely emptied of residents; buildings are barricaded and windows taped; and the once-bustling streets are lined with checkpoints and Molotov cocktails waiting to be used. The soldiers who man the posts are sometimes friendly, at other times tense, as everyone braces for the onslaught of attacks.

Several rounds of talks between Ukraine and Russia have yielded little. Some humanitarian corridors have been established and respected allowing people to be shuttled out of hard-hit towns, but hundreds of thousands remain trapped. Talks are ongoing, last week both sides signalled that progress had been made on plans to end the violence.

But as the war has endured for a month, the fighting shows little signs of abating.

Life under Soviet rule

As a child, Dima says he dreamed of leaving Ukraine.

Growing up under Soviet rule, television programmes decried the West and broadcast information about how the Soviet Union was the only free place on Earth, something Dima started questioning as he got older.

“I heard adults talk [about] politics and you know, as I was growing up, I was realising more and more that [everything wasn’t] true.”

He buried himself in Jules Verne novels, wishing he could go on adventures like the characters in the stories. Knowing that there were only a few ways someone could leave the Soviet Union, he told his parents he would join the military academy and become a sailor so he could see the world.

When Dima thinks about life under Soviet rule, what stands out most were the long lines and uniformity, he says; how everyone dressed the same, and people’s apartments were styled with similar furniture because there was little choice.

Sometimes he and his father would break the rules and buy delicacy foods at a store his aunt ran for veterans, which was better stocked but prohibited access to the general public.

After the Soviet Union collapsed in the early 1990s, Dima’s family struggled to survive. His father, who worked at a crystal factory, was often not paid for months. The factory’s owner would give him crystal in lieu of money and tell him to sell it at the market, Dima says.

But with time came more opportunity and Dima no longer felt he had to become a sailor to fulfil his dream of leaving the country. Instead, he studied linguistics at university in Kyiv focusing on speaking foreign languages like English and French, which he believed was his ticket out. He did an internship in the United Kingdom before returning to Ukraine and landing a job at a foreign embassy, which he is not authorised to name, where he has spent the last 18 years.

Dima still technically works at the embassy, and says the job has allowed him to fulfil his boyhood dream of travelling the world. He’s been to parts of Africa, the United States and Europe for work and family vacations. “[I] used to be happy with my life,” he sighs, “before [the war] started.”

The war has been traumatic for people across the country. Travelling to several front-line cities in March, Al Jazeera spoke to Ukrainians displaced from their homes and who watched relatives die trying to flee Russian air raids.

In the southern town of Mykolaiv, which has been bombarded by nearly daily air raids, the morgue was overflowing with bodies and had to leave some outside for relatives to retrieve because there was no space inside, said Mykola Chechmil who works at the morgue.

Most people told Al Jazeera that while they weren’t surprised by Russia’s invasion, they were shocked at the scale and scope of the violence. Some said they thought it would only last a few days and be confined to the east, where conflict has been continuing since Russian-backed separatists began fighting in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014.

‘One room with 150 men’

When the first missiles struck Ukraine on February 24, Dima was at a hospital in Kyiv caring for his father-in-law who had a stroke a few days prior. “I was thinking, “OK, what do we do? What do we do?’” he says.

Most of the doctors and nurses had left to check on their families and he did not want to leave his father-in-law alone. So he moved him to his own house and then drove his son and parents to a safe location.

Deciding to fight was not a personal dilemma for Dima. The challenge was getting a unit to accept him because most were full, giving preference to people with past military experience, he says.

“I was kind of upset, very upset, because, you know, I wanted to help my country.” He had to call in a few favours and was finally able to join a unit in Kyiv.

Once he signed up, what scared him most was telling his wife. He first eased her into the idea by saying he’d be home from the base every night, but after arriving he called to tell her he wasn’t allowed to leave. Dima tries to speak to his wife and son twice a day. They both support his decision, he says; his son even told him he wished he were 18 so he could also join the fight.

When Dima was allocated a unit, overnight, he went from living in a two-bedroom flat with his family, to sharing a space with 150 men. “I’m not used to sleeping in one room with 150 men and waking up all together, going to brush our teeth, have breakfast, lunch and dinner at a certain time … Lots of things were, of course, unfamiliar for me, you know. Like I have to ask permission every time I go out, I have to ask permission if I can talk to someone,” he says.

Dima’s unit sleeps in bunk beds in the army barracks, waking every morning at 6:30am and eating breakfast together before being given the day’s agenda. Each day of training consists of learning a different skill – from clearing buildings, to shooting, to patrolling, to manning checkpoints and basic survival skills. The training is intense, but not too hard, he says.

In the evenings, Dima works at headquarters, creating lists of new military arrivals to ensure there’s enough food and equipment and to have a record of who is where, since troops are constantly moving and being deployed across the country.

Dima is good at taking orders, and says he trusts and fully relies on what his trainers teach him, even if many of them are half his age.

In the weeks since joining, he has learned how to assemble and disassemble a gun, approach buildings taken by the enemy, and apply first aid. But not everything is easy to absorb, he shares. For example, he was taught that if someone is shot at while helping a wounded soldier, they should use the injured person as a human shield.

“See how bad it sounds?” he says. “I hope that I will not have to be in a situation where I have to cover myself with a wounded battle buddy, but if it happens, I’ll be ready,” he adds matter of factly. He has also been taking advice from military friends abroad, such as counting the number of shots when firing a gun to maintain his concentration.

Since the start of the invasion, the entire country has rallied together in a war-time effort some conflict analysts said has not been seen anywhere since World War II.

In the town of Bila Tserkva, less than 100km (62 miles) south of the capital and one of the last gateways from which to send humanitarian and military assistance to Kyiv, a metal factory that once made parts for farming equipment and barbeques, is churning out armoured vests, anti-tank barriers and metal pieces for tourniquets – equipment to stop severe bleeding – free of charge.

Across town, volunteer fighters and civilians flow in and out of the Territorial Defence headquarters, sorting donations of clothes, packaging medical kits and feeding exhausted newly trained soldiers.

“There’s two ways [to deal with the war] one way is just to sit and wait, the other is to fight,” says Mykola Surovskyi, a 37-year-old asparagus and wheat farmer turned fighter, who has only ever shot a gun with friends. He says he’s working on improving his aim during shooting practice before being deployed.

Volunteers scurry in and out of the kitchen at the volunteer headquarters preparing dinner for him and the other fighters. Seated on a chair after a long day of training, Surovskyi says he felt more at ease once he sent his seven-month-old son, seven-year-old daughter and wife to the country’s west where the situation is calmer.

‘I fear that I will not be back from a fight’

Active soldiers in Ukraine’s armed forces say they have limited time to train inexperienced fighters – sometimes up to 300 people a day, according to Andriy Reznik, a 41-year-old veteran soldier and trainer.

While many people want to fight, Reznik says not everyone will be allowed to continue past the training. “You can see in people’s eyes who’s ready” and the ones who are not are given other volunteer tasks, he adds.

Civilians across the country have already been doing anything they can to contribute to the war effort. Those who cannot fight are bringing soldiers food, constructing and delivering armour and coordinating the transfer of medicine and clothes to remote and inaccessible areas. Yet many civilians-turned-soldiers on the front lines tell Al Jazeera they lack equipment such as vests and helmets and say that without more Western help it will be hard to maintain the fight.

In different locations, several civilian fighters with the Territorial Defence Force told Al Jazeera there is a heavy infiltration of Russian spies, or “saboteurs” as they are called, who write messages using invisible ink on walls or attach beacons to strategic objects that transmit signals to missiles as to their location. However, this could not be independently verified.

Alleged Russian spies who have been caught usually tell the Ukrainian soldiers they did not understand what was being fought for. In a video taken by one soldier in Odesa allegedly of a captured Russian spy and seen by Al Jazeera, the Russian repents to the camera saying, “they’re [Russians] not bombing military infrastructure but civilian ones”.

Some soldiers say at times they have used the Russian infiltration to their advantage. One unit in Odesa allegedly staved off Russian ships from the Black Sea by slowly and deliberately planting Molotov cocktails along the shore over several days, in order to give the spies time to inform troops in the approaching ship of what was happening, Andrey Vagapov, chief of one of the Territorial Defence units in Odesa told Al Jazeera. After being informed that the shore was lined with explosives, the officers on board the ship refused to come, he said.

As Russian ground troops struggle to advance, the Ukrainians are preparing for an increase in artillery fire, which is already moving closer to Kyiv in order to attack the city, said Orysia Lutsevych, head of the Ukraine Forum at Chatham House, a UK-based think-tank.

“The fact that Ukraine still controls parts of its sky and uses anti-aircraft weapons quite successfully means Russians may deploy more missiles to hit targets with more collateral damage to civilians and civilian infrastructure.” But even if Russia bombards the city from the outskirts, the Territorial Defence, together with the Ukrainian army, will make it really difficult for them to establish ground control over the city, she added.

“Territorial [Defence] troops will be the bane of Russia …” a former US military intelligence official who did not want to be named out of fear for his safety, told Al Jazeera. “Molotov cocktails are a powerful weapon against a tank’s air vents. [But] the Ukrainians need actual physical humans to fight by their sides [and] Ukraine needs more troops.”

In Kyiv, Dima and his unit are stepping up. When Al Jazeera spoke with him in mid-March, Dima had approximately one week left of training before being deployed.

Eager to go to the front lines, when he finishes training his unit he will be sent to clear areas taken back from Russian forces, man checkpoints in and around Kyiv or patrol the city looking for suspicious people.

He is both anxious and looking forward to what lies ahead. What worries him most is what it could do to his family if he doesn’t return.

“I fear that I will not be back from a fight and it will be hard for my family,” he says, his eyes welling up with tears. “That’s my only fear. I’m not scared to be killed. I just don’t want my family to go through this awful loss.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2022/3/23/the-civilian-fighters-taking-up-arms-on-ukraines-front-lines

Instead of homes and offices, they were making giant, metal anti-tank barricades known as ""hedgehogs"", and smaller spiked barriers aimed at stopping wheeled vehicles.

After Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb 24, KAN, a large local property company, reinvented itself to help the defences of the city of 3.4 million people.

Zakhar, a foreman, picked up the phone and started calling the company's construction workers who had remained in Kyiv. Almost everyone volunteered to stay and contribute, he said.

""We build things. We do not know how to fight, but we knew we could be useful,"" Zakhar said. A few metres away sparks flew as builders cut through and welded together large metal beams.

It is another example of how Ukrainian civilians are supporting regular troops as they try to repel Russia's advance, including through civil defence units and independent militia that have formed across the country.

Russia says its actions in Ukraine are a ""special operation"" not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it calls dangerous nationalists.

Ukraine's military is dwarfed by that of its powerful neighbour, but resistance in the first week of the conflict has slowed Russia's progress, particularly in urban areas.

Russia has captured one Ukrainian city so far - the southern Dnipro River port of Kherson - and has bombarded others with increasing intensity, including Kyiv and the country's second city Kharkiv.

A giant column of Russian armour has stalled as it approaches Kyiv from the north, delayed by resistance, mechanical failures and congestion, according to the British defence ministry.

Hundreds of thousands of people have fled the violence and crossed into neighbouring countries. Men of fighting age are prevented from leaving Ukraine.

'WE WILL THROW SPEARS'

On Feb. 25, Kyiv's mayor and boxing champion, Vitali Klitschko, said the city ""has gone into the defensive phase.""

Heavy equipment was brought in to build concrete checkpoints, blocking positions and bunkers inside the city and along all major roads and in the suburbs.

At KAN, workers cut long pieces of girder using blow torches and angle grinders, welding them together into triangular barriers used to bolster fortifications and slow the movement of tanks and tracked armoured personnel carriers.

Oleksandr Bodyuk, the company's deputy director, said workers were also using reinforcing bars and girders salvaged from construction sites to produce spiked, movable defences against wheeled vehicles, including trucks.

So far the makeshift factory, which started operating this week, has produced 110 large hedgehogs, including 40 in the fist 12 hours, Bodyuk said, adding that the company runs other similar sites in the city.

""We have demands from many places for these types of blocking devices, we deliver them wherever they are needed in the area ... subcontractors and friends are providing transportation for the products and the material,"" he said.

Andriy Kryschenko, Kyiv's deputy mayor who was wearing military fatigues, said many similar firms and workshops had adapted to produce hedgehogs, concrete barriers and other defences.

He added that tens of thousands of people in Kyiv had received weapons and many more were waiting at enlistment and recruitment offices. The city hall was also supporting Territorial Defence units and troops at the frontline, Kryschenko said.

At the construction site, Serhiy Serdyuk, a grizzled welder in his 50s, said workers were ready to take up weapons and join the fight.

""If we have to, when the materials run out, we will make spears and we will throw those spears at them.""

7,6259ef85-29e2-4d64-a662-712410c85434,"['Kim Bubello', 'Chad De Guzman']",,"When Russia launched an attack on Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy immediately vowed to arm any of the 43 million citizens who volunteered to defend the country.

While one million Ukranians have already fled to neighboring states for safety, others have enlisted in the Territorial Defense Forces (TDF), which organizes Ukraine’s militias. Some received combat training, with bank employees and teachers learning how to use AK-style assault rifles. Those who aren’t prepared for combat have taken on other tasks, like weaving camouflage nets to hide Ukrainian artillery from Russian reconnaissance. Some transformed their homes into makeshift sites for manufacturing molotov cocktails. Volunteers dug trenches and barricades to guard against attacks.

These concerted efforts have helped support the Ukrainian military, which has managed to defy the expectations of even Western military observers and slow the Russian advance. That is despite Moscow’s overwhelming advantage in the number of troops and military firepower. Olena Prokopenko, the co-chair of the Transatlantic Task Force of Ukraine and a German Marshall Fund visiting fellow, says the TDF is an “integral part” of the resistance and “significantly increases” Ukrainians’ chances of holding back Russia’s invasion.

Citizen resistance in Ukraine isn’t new. In 2014, an unprepared Ukraine had to rely on volunteer armed groups as Russian-backed separatists began breakaway campaigns in the eastern Donbas region, and Russian forces annexed the Crimean Peninsula. As Russia built up its forces near the Ukrainian border in 2021, the Ukrainian government passed a law legitimizing these ad hoc armed groups, making them an official part of national defense.

The government in Kyiv launched the TDF earlier this year, comprising 25 locally organized brigades (one per region) split into 150 battalions (one per administrative district). Around 10,000 full-time soldiers will make up the core of the force, but Ukraine hopes to recruit 1.5 million to 2 million people. Thousands of Ukrainians are already signing up to help defend their country from Russian invaders.

“Our people are very much motivated, very much so,” Zelenskyy told the European Union in an impassioned speech. “We are fighting for our rights, for our freedom, for life. And now, we are fighting for survival.”

While a US defence official suggested it appeared to have “stalled”, there was also speculation that an estimated 15,000 troops attached to it may be regrouping, and potentially waiting for logistical supplies before an assault on Kyiv.

Efforts to ascertain the status of the convoy and the threat it poses have been set back by recent cloud cover over Ukraine that has prevented Maxar Technologies – which issued the first satellite images of the convoy – from releasing new pictures.

“Heavy cloud cover has blanketed Ukraine,” said Maxar, “and [it has] prevented us from providing new satellite imagery-based updates of the current activity.”

While information about Russian troop movements in other parts of Ukraine where there has been fighting has been well documented on social media, the convoy outside Kyiv has existed in what amounts to an information black hole, suggesting that Russia forces may closely control the territory around it.

The convoy, which at one stage was reportedly about 40 miles (65km) in length, with vehicles pictured three abreast on the P02 road to the immediate north of Kyiv, includes armoured vehicles, tanks, trucks, fuel tankers and artillery pieces. Its presence suggested Russian forces were massing for an attack on Kyiv.

Western defence assessments in the UK and US, however, put a more optimistic slant on the convoy’s apparent lack of progress, although it was not clear what evidence that was based on.

The UK’s Ministry of Defence tweeted: “The main body of the large Russian column advancing on Kyiv remains over 30km from the centre of the city, having been delayed by staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion. The column has made little discernible progress in over three days.”

The Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby, in a press briefing on Wednesday, gave a more nuanced assessment, saying there had been limited movement from the military force and that it “remain[ed] stalled”. However, he cautioned that lack of movement could be due to Russia’s forces regrouping.

Saying that the convoy had “not made any appreciable progress, geographically speaking, in the last 24-36 hours”, Kirby added: “In general we believe there are a couple of reasons for that. One reason is we believe the Russians are deliberately regrouping themselves and reassessing the progress that they have not made and how to make up the lost time.

“Two, we do believe that they have experienced logistic and sustainment challenges. Challenges that we don’t believe they fully anticipated. Three, they are getting resistance from the Ukrainians. We have some indications, nothing that we can 100% verify, that the Ukrainians have indeed tried to slow down that convoy.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/03/concern-mounting-huge-russian-military-convoy-outside-kyiv-ukraine

Update 2 March 2022 at 05:13 EST

While the war in Ukraine wages on, more stories of the Ukrainian civilians standing up to Russian forces are emerging.

In the latest video to go viral, unarmed Ukrainian civilians in the city of Melitopol are seen attempting to stop Russian vehicles and tanks from moving towards Kyiv. In a heroic act, they formed a human barrier to block the Russian forces, all while chanting “Occupiers! We are unarmed, this is our land. Leave!” Though the Russian troops open fire, the crowd remains.

Several videos like this one are emerging of Ukrainian citizens resisting the Russian forces throughout Ukraine.

Vladimir Putin’s reckless plan of invading Ukraine is not going as well as he expected, it would seem, as there was poor planning and now strong resistance. Shortages of food and fuel have stopped some tanks from getting very far and there is very little support for Russia. Companies like Apple, Boeing, and Ford have dropped support completely, suspending operations and sales.",https://en.as.com/en/2022/03/02/videos/1646215758_980932.html
