The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

How you can help: Here are ways those in the U.S. can help support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.

THURSDAY, APRIL 14, 2022

Two Ukrainian Neptune missiles struck the Russian missile cruiser Moskva, which later sank, according to a senior U.S. Defense official who was not authorized to speak publicly. The cruiser is believed to be about between 60 and 65 nautical miles south of Odesa and almost exactly due south.

Pentagon officials had previously said they could not confirm the Ukrainian claim of responsibility for an attack that caused the damage, but they did not refute it. Russia initially denied a report that the Moskva, flagship of its Black Sea fleet, sank. The cruiser usually has about 500 officers and crew.

The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation later claimed that the warship sank under tow in stormy conditions due to damage to the hull received due to a fire from the detonation of ammunition, according to Tass, Russia's state news agency.

“The ship was seriously damaged. The crew was completely evacuated,” the ministry added.

The ministry said the fire had been contained and that the ship would be towed to port with its guided missile launchers intact.

Fighting intensifies in Eastern Ukraine

TUESDAY, APRIL 12, 2022

Russia is resupplying and reinforcing its invasion force in eastern Ukraine with a long convoy of vehicles heading to the region, indicating a new phase of the war is likely to occur there, according to a senior Pentagon official.

The convoy, exposed in commercial satellite imagery on April 8, stretches an estimated eight miles. It appears to contain vehicles to command and supply infantry units and possibly helicopters, said the official, who provided intelligence assessments on condition of anonymity.

Mariupol: US 'deeply concerned' of possible chemical weapons use

TUESDAY, APRIL 12, 2022

Global concerns that Russia will resort to chemical weapons in Ukraine were rising Tuesday after a separatist spokesman suggested to a Russian TV audience that separatists may use chemicals against Ukrainian soldiers holed up at a giant steel factory in Mariupol “to smoke them out of there.”

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby called the reports of chemical weapons use ""deeply concerning."" U.K. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said officials were working to ""urgently"" investigate what she called ""a callous escalation"" of the war.

Rocket strike kills dozens at Kramatorsk train station

FRIDAY, APRIL 8, 2022

Thousands of people were waiting at a train station in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk on Friday when a rocket strike killed dozens, including children, and possibly injured hundreds more, Ukrainian officials said.

At least 39 people were killed and between 87 and 300 people were injured, regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said in a Telegram post. Ukrainian officials earlier estimated about 30 people had been killed in the attack.

Destruction in town of Borodyanka

THURSDAY, APRIL 6, 2022

The town of Borodyanka, outside Kyiv, suffered the greatest number of civilian casualties under Russian occupation, Ukrainian Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova said on national television Monday.

A video posted to Twitter by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine shows the destruction. ""Only 42 days ago, 13,000 people lived in this village. russian occupiers brought death and destruction here. They wanted to do the same with the whole of Ukraine. But our army fought back. Borodyanka is under the Ukrainian flag again,"" the tweet reads.

Russian forces pull back from Kyiv

MONDAY, APRIL 4, 2022

A growing chorus of world leaders on Monday condemned Russia after Ukrainian officials and journalists reported scores of dead civilians when Russian troops retreated from areas around Kyiv.

A new report from Human Rights Watch, released Sunday, said Russian military forces have committed war crimes in Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Kyiv, including repeated rape, two cases of summary execution and other cases of unlawful violence and threats against civilians from Feb. 27 to March 14.

Mass grave site and evidence of war crimes in Bucha, Ukraine

MONDAY APRIL 4, 2022

Maxar satellite imagery shows a mass grave estimated to be 45 feet in length in Bucha, Ukraine. According to Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, 280 people were buried on the grounds of the church of St. Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints. Graphic images of civilians murdered with their hands bound behind their backs have began to surface as reporters and visual journalist have begun to reenter the area once occupied by Russian troops. Associated Press reporters counted the bodies of at least 21 people in various spots around the city.

Leaders and top government officials in France, Albania, Kosovo, Spain, Poland, Estonia, Japan, New Zealand and the EU's top diplomat condemned the actions, and the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights called for an investigation into what happened. Russia has dismissed the accusations.

President Joe Biden on Monday called for a war crimes trial against Russian President Vladimir Putin and more sanctions against Russia following new reports of atrocities in Ukraine after Russian troops retreated from areas around Kyiv.

""We saw what happened in Bucha. He is a war criminal,” Biden told reporters when returning to the White House from Delaware, adding the Russian leader is “brutal.”

Biden joined a growing chorus of world leaders on Monday who condemned Russia after Ukrainian officials said the bodies of 410 civilians were found in Kyiv-area towns that were recently retaken from Russian forces.

Russia accuses Ukraine of attacking oil depot with helicopters

FRIDAY, APRIL 1, 2022

Russia on Friday accused Ukraine of attacking a fuel depot in Belgorod, which would be the first Ukrainian air strike on Russian soil if confirmed. Vyacheslav Gladkov, regional governor of Belgorod, wrote on Telegram on Friday that two Ukrainian helicopters conducted an air strike late Thursday on the oil facility, which is about 20 miles from Russia’s border with Ukraine.

Kyiv has denied involvement in the attack. ""For some reason they say that we did it, but according to our information this does not correspond to reality,"" Ukraine's Security Council Secretary Oleksiy Danilov said on Ukrainian television.

Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba previously said he could neither confirm nor deny reports of Ukrainian involvement because he was not privy to all military information.

Bombings continue in Kyiv after Russia's promise to scale back

THURSDAY, MARCH 31, 2022

Earlier this week, Moscow announced plans to dial back its military activity in and around Kyiv, but the Pentagon said less than 20% of the forces have been removed. Ukrainian authorities said Russian forces instead began bombarding homes, stores, libraries and other civilian sites on the outskirts of Kyiv.

The mayor of Kyiv says rocket attacks and explosions east and north of the city continued despite Russia’s promise to back down.

""It simply does not exist anymore""

WEDNESDAY, MARCH 30, 2022

Signs of explosion and battle in eastern Ukraine

SATURDAY, MARCH 26, 2022

Evidence of a battle is seen south of Izyum, about 10 miles west of border of the heavily contested Donetsk region. In this satellite image by Maxar Technologies a large crater can be seen next to seven armored vehicles. About one mile north, evidence of tanks and destroyed buildings were also seen in the city of Izyum.

Ukrainian Navy reports it destroyed Russian landing ship

THURSDAY, MARCH 24, 2022

Ukraine’s navy reports that it sunk a Russian ship in the Sea of Azov near the port city of Berdyansk. It released photos and video of fire and thick smoke coming from the port area. Russia did not immediately comment on the claim.

The Russians have several warships off the coast of Ukraine in the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, a senior administration official speaking on the condition of anonymity told reporters Thursday. They include surface combatants that have shelled the city of Mariupol. They also have amphibious landing craft, supply ships and patrol boats.

Mariupol rejects Russian demands for surrender

MONDAY, MARCH 21, 2022

The pounding of Mariupol intensified Sunday and a top U.S. official expressed concern about the prospect of Russian-organized ""concentration and prisoner camps"" as Russia's bloody assault on Ukraine waded deeper into its fourth week.

The Mariupol city council accused the Russian military of bombing an art school where about 400 people had taken shelter. There was no immediate word on casualties at the school.

American man killed in Chernihiv, Ukraine

FRIDAY, MARCH 18, 2022

Jim Hill, an American, was killed Wednesday in a Russian attack on Chernihiv, Ukraine, where he was seeking medical treatment for his partner. His death was reported by his sister.

""My brother Jimmy Hill was killed yesterday in Chernihiv, Ukraine. He was waiting in a bread line with several other people when they were gunned down"" by Russian military forces, Cheryl Hill Gordon wrote on Facebook Thursday. ""His body was found in the street by the local police.""

Ten people were killed Wednesday in Chernihiv while standing in the bread line, Ukrainian officials reported.

Russian’s strike Mariupol theater used as shelter

THURSDAY, MARCH 17, 2022

Russian airstrikes ripped apart a theater in Mariupol that served as a makeshift shelter for hundreds of people, Ukrainian officials said Thursday. The theater was bombed late Wednesday even though the word ""CHILDREN"" was laid out in giant letters in front of the building to protect it. The strikes left many civilians buried in the burning rubble, Ukraine’s foreign ministry said in a statement. There was no immediate word on how many people were killed or injured.

Russian’s airstrikes moves to western Ukraine

WEDNESDAY, MARCH 16, 2022

Russian forces have struck several cities in western Ukraine since March 11. The barrage marked an escalation of Moscow’s offensive and moved the fighting perilously close to the Polish border. More than 30 Russian cruise missiles hit the International Peacekeeping and Security Center (IPSC) facility in Yavoriv, which has long been used to train Ukrainian soldiers, often with instructors from the United States and other countries in the Western alliance

NATO said Sunday that it currently does not have any personnel in Ukraine, though the United States has increased the number of U.S. troops deployed to Poland, according to the Associated Press.

Rocket attack near Poland border hits

MONDAY, MARCH 14, 2022

Russian forces carried out an air strike on a military range near Lviv in western Ukraine, expanding its offensive closer to the border with Poland. The Russian military on Sunday morning fired eight rockets at the Yaroviv military range 18 miles northwest of Lviv, the Lviv regional administration said. At least 35 people were reported killed.

The Yaroviv military range, also known as the Yaroviv International Peacekeeping and Security Center, is located 10 miles from Ukraine’s border with Poland.

Ukraine authorities report Russian missiles bombed hospital in Mariupol’

WEDNESDAY, MARCH 9, 2022

A Russian attack devastated a maternity and children's hospital in the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, Ukrainian officials said Wednesday. At least 17 people were reported injured, most of them staff members. ""The destruction is enormous,"" the city council said. ""The building of the medical institution where children were treated was completely destroyed.” AP and The Washington Post report that a Russian airstrike caused the devastation.

Millions of Ukrainian refugees flee from western border

TUESDAY, MARCH 8, 2022

The number of refugees reached 2 million on Tuesday, according to the United Nations, the fastest exodus Europe has seen since World War II. One million were children, UNICEF spokesman James Elder tweeted, calling it “a dark historical first.” Most others were women.

A decree by Ukraine’s government that prohibits men aged 18 to 60 from leaving the country means that most of those fleeing are women and children, though the U.N. doesn't have exact numbers on gender. Ukraine's policy is meant to encourage men to sign up to fight against Russia’s invasion or to keep them available for military conscription.

Ukraine calls Russian humanitarian corridors proposal ""unacceptable""

MONDAY, MARCH 7, 2022

Russia had promised a cease-fire to allow safe passage for evacuees from the capital of Kyiv, the southern port city of Mariupol, and the cities of Kharkiv and Sumy. Some of the evacuation routes, however, would funnel civilians toward Russia or its ally Belarus, a plan that Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Irina Vereshchuk called unacceptable. U.K. Europe Minister James Cleverly agreed, saying that ""evacuation routes into the arms of the country that is currently destroying yours is nonsense.”

Shell ignites fire as Russians capture nuclear plant

FRIDAY, MARCH 4, 2022

Russian troops seized Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe, early Friday with shelling that hit the plant and ignited a fire, causing fears of a nuclear disaster. However, the shell hit a training center that is ""not part of the reactor,"" said a U.N. official. The fire was extinguished and it appeared there was no radiation leak. The plant's Ukrainian staff is in control of the reactor, but Ukrainian officials said Russian troops control the overall site. Only one reactor is operating at around 60% capacity.

Kherson reportedly captured by Russian troops

THURSDAY, MARCH 3, 2022

Russian forces have reportedly seized Kherson, a key Ukrainian port city on the Black Sea. Igor Kolykhaev, the mayor, said Thursday that troops had occupied the city council building and imposed curfews, but the Ukrainian defense ministry denied the city was under Russian authority. Control of the city, with a population of about 280,000, could allow the Russian military to establish a base of operations for moving farther into Ukraine.

U.S. closes airspace to Russia

Europe, Canada and the U.S. have closed their airspace to Russian airlines following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The airspace restrictions have led to canceled flights, while others planes have been forced to turn around. The restrictions will likely add flight time and, in turn, increase fuel costs. Cargo carrier FedEx said on Feb. 27 that it has temporarily suspended flights to Russia.

Battle for Kharkiv continues as Russian rocket strikes hit civilian areas

In Kharkiv, at least 11 people were killed and 35 wounded in the rocket strike, Interior Ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said. He said the death toll was expected to rise. Closed-circuit television footage showed a fireball engulfing a street in front of one building, and a few cars rolled out of the billowing smoke.

Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said Tuesday that his government remained in control but said the city is surrounded by Russian troops.

“Military equipment and armored vehicles are coming from different directions,” he told The Washington Post in a phone interview.

Terekhov said a government building and the opera and ballet theater were among buildings shelled. Transformer stations were also struck by artillery, cutting off power to much of the city, he said. The shelling had stalled efforts to supply the city with food and medical supplies, he said.

“There are casualties, and by now, there are certainly a lot more of them, after the night and morning shelling,” he told the Post. “The situation is pretty grave.”

On Sunday, Russian troops entered Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, and fighting is underway in the streets, according to the Associated Press. Videos posted on Ukrainian media and social networks showed Russian vehicles moving across Kharkiv and a light vehicle burning on the street. Residents were urged to stay inside.

The troops in Kharkiv arrived after Russia unleashed a wave of attacks on Ukraine, targeting airfields and fuel facilities. Two large explosions rocked an area south of the capital just before 1 a.m. local time. Zelenskyy’s office said one of the blasts was near the Zhuliany airport and the other blast hit an oil depot about 25 miles south of the capital, according to the mayor of Vasylkiv via the AP. Russian forces also blew up a gas pipeline in Kharkiv, according to the Ukrainian president's office.

Russian forces attack Kyiv

The main Russian force has advanced slowly to within about 15 miles of Kyiv’s city center as they continue to face stiff Ukrainian opposition and their own logistical problems.

Ukrainian forces have attacked Russian troops and combat vehicles with small arms and surface-to-air missiles, a senior Defense Department official told reporters on Monday. The official discussed the military operations on condition of anonymity. Ukrainians have also blunted the Russian advance by blowing up bridges, the official said.

Since Sunday, the Russians have moved about three miles closer to the Ukrainian capital, the official said. They appear intent on encircling the city. Nearly 75% of the combat troops Russian President Vladimir Putin deployed for the war are inside Ukraine.

Meanwhile, Russian vehicles have been running out of gas, the official said. It’s unclear if that represents a failure of Russian officials to plan, or their troops inability to execute it.

Russia has also failed to control Ukraine’s airspace, with Ukrainian forces still able to fly warplanes and operate anti-aircraft missiles.

Russian forces closed in on Kyiv in the early hours of Saturday, but dawn brought limited clarity about how far the invading troops had penetrated into the Ukrainian capital. It was not immediately clear how far the soldiers had advanced. Skirmishes reported on the edge of the city suggested that small Russian units were probing Ukrainian defenses to clear a path for the main forces.

Russian forces attacked Boryspil International Airport, near the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. Ukraine closed its airspace to commercial flights, saying Russian missile attacks presented too high a risk.

Ukraine says 13 soldiers were killed after refusing to surrender on Snake Island

A group of Ukrainian soldiers who garnered worldwide attention after telling a Russian warship to “Go f--- yourself” may be alive, according to Ukrainian officials.

Ukraine's State Border Guard Service of Ukraine in a statement said the soldiers may have been captured by Russian forces and are still alive. The statement added that Russian media reports say the captured soldiers were sent to Sevastopol, a city in Crimea.

""We sincerely hope that the boys will return home as soon as possible, and the information received at the time of the attack on the death will not be confirmed,"" the statement says, and as translated in multiple reports.

The thirteen Ukrainian border guards stationed on Snake Island, a strategic small outpost in the Black Sea, were reportedly killed after a Russian warship asked them to surrender. A border guard responded with an expletive before being bombed, according to unverified audio. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said all 13 will be awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine posthumously.

Russia demands NATO exclude Ukraine

NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is a major factor in Russia’s decision to invade Ukraine, which wants to join NATO and the European Union. Other former Soviet republics have joined NATO over the years, and Putin is against Ukraine’s inclusion. In diplomatic talks, he demanded assurances from NATO that it wouldn’t admit Ukraine. NATO said the decision is up to Ukraine.

Putin declares Ukraine Donbas regions as independent republics

The Donbas region in eastern Ukraine has been divided by Russia-backed militants since 2014, when Russia illegally annexed Crimea. These forces control the “people’s republics” of Donetsk and Luhansk. Putin recognized both as independent republics Feb. 21, then sent Russian troops into them for “peacekeeping duties.”

Russian troops capture Chernobyl nuclear power plant

The closed plant is the site of the world’s worst nuclear disaster. A reactor core melted down in April 1986, releasing radioactive particles into the air and across Europe. The Ukraine Ministry of Foreign Affairs tweeted, “If Russia continues the war, Chornobyl can happen again in 2022.”

Central European nations prepare for Ukrainian refugees

Over 900,000 Ukrainians have left their country to seek asylum in neighboring states as a result of the Russian invasion. The majority have migrated west to Poland

The list of nations planning to take in Ukrainian refugees fleeing invading Russian includes former members of the USSR and countries formerly allied with or occupied by Russia:

Czech Republic (formerly occupied by Russia)

Estonia (former member of USSR)

Hungary (formerly occupied by Russia)

Latvia (former member of USSR)

Lithuania (former member of USSR)

Moldova (former member of USSR)

Poland (formerly occupied by Russia)

Romania (formerly occupied by USSR)

Slovakia (formerly occupied by Russia)

These nations and others are braced for a massive flood of refugees, Reuters and other sources reported. As many as 5 million could leave the country.

3,aef2d36e-100e-4457-aea8-e011904b5ef3,['Social Links For Callie Patteson'],2022-02-23 00:00:00,"Dozens of Russian tanks and other military vehicles entering eastern Ukraine this week have sported a mysterious white “Z” marking painted on their sides, causing speculation on social media about what the symbol could mean.

Videos and still images of the vehicles show the letter either by itself or enclosed by a white triangle, square or circle. Other symbols — such as a white triangle with two lines on either side, red triangles, white circles, white triangles and white slashes — have also been spotted on some of the vehicles.

The markings are not just limited to tanks, but have also been seen on trucks and amphibious rigs.

Most observers suggest the markings are identifying signals to fellow Russian troops in order to avoid being victimized by friendly fire. Others have speculated that the markings could identify what company the vehicles are a part of or where they are supposed to be headed in the event of an invasion.

Such signals are not out of the norm for vehicles used in combat. During World War II, the United States military employed similar markings on armored vehicles and jeeps for identification purposes.

“Numerous videos are being uploaded of Russian military vehicles with ‘Z’ markings. Our assessment is it’s ‘friend or foe’ identification markings used by armies during wartime,” posted Ukraine War Report, a Twitter account that has been monitoring the Russian troop buildup, according to the UK’s Telegraph newspaper. The account has since been suspended from the social media site.

Get the latest updates in the Russia-Ukraine conflict with The Post’s live coverage.

On Saturday, Ph.D. student and Russian defense policy observer Rob Lee, who has called attention to many of the marked vehicles around the Ukrainian border, speculated that the symbols are used to “identify different task forces or echelons.”

Lee later pointed to a post from a popular Russian Telegram channel that alleged what the signs meant.

The US used similar markings during World War II for identification purposes. social media/e2w

Some speculate that the markings are used to avoid friendly fire. Social media / east2west news

“The source said what the tactical signs on Russian military equipment mean: Z – Kharkiv direction [Triangle] Slavyansk, Kramatorsk [Circle] mobile reserve,” a translated version of the post read.

Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, is located just over 20 miles from the border of Russia while Slavyansk and Kramatorsk are located just outside the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic, which are controlled by pro-Russian separatists.

It has not been confirmed that the markings signify where the vehicles are headed.

Another possibility, Lee has noted, is that the possible variations indicate “different task forces.”

“Most of the ‘Z’ markings seen thus far have been inside a square, but this Ural truck with a Msta-B howitzer has one inside a triangle. Possibly indicating different task forces within a larger formation or echelon. This is in Valuyki,” he tweeted, referring to a Russian city just 16 miles from the Ukrainian border.

If Russia does move forward with a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, its forces are expected to push west from the separatist regions as well as south from Belarus, where Moscow recently extended joint military exercises.

The markings are not limited to Russian regulars, either.

On Tuesday, Lee shared images of what he claimed were “Rosgvardia troops” — Russia’s national guard — and “Avtozaks (prisoner transport trucks).”

Some have identified certain vehicles as Russian Rosgvardia troops and Avtozaks, which are prisoner transport vehicles. social media/e2w

“This is a giant red flag. These are Rosgvardia troops and Avtozaks (prisoner transport trucks) with the ‘Z’ markings in Belgorod. A strong indication that Rosgvardia troops would take part in any invasion,” Lee tweeted.

Despite the speculation, other investigative organizations are stumped as to the precise meaning of the markings.

“Many people ask us about this ‘Zorro squad,’ but I don’t know why they draw this giant Z on vehicles. Some believe that this is a sign for their own aircraft, so that their own would not be bombed. But we see a lot of movement of vehicles every day and this Z is very rare,” Ruslan Leviev of the Conflict Intelligence Team tweeted last weekend.

Not long after, Bellingcat reporter Aric Toler clarified that Ruslan has been looking into these types of markings for eight years.

“Re: the ‘Zorro Squad’, or all the Russian military vehicles that (starting today) have Latin Z’s painted on their sides,” Toler posted. “Ruslan has been monitoring this stuff nonstop for 8 years and has no idea what they are, and hasn’t seen it before. So, assume the worst, I guess/fear.”

Having become “kinetic,” the situation in Ukraine has also become overly dynamic; I hope readers will supply up-to-date and vetted information as events progress, because I feel that whatever detail I go into here will rapidly become obsolete (or turn out to have been based on bad data; see below)[1]. Meanwhile, here are a few back of the envelope calculations to help scope the matter.

First, kilometers. Search tells me that Kyiv, Ukraine is 327km from Gomel, Belarus, near the border. Converting to the imperial system of measurement — ironic name, that — for my own comprehension, that’s 203.188 miles. Assuming conservatively that a tank can move at 25 miles per hour, that’s about 8 hours for Russian tanks to reach Ukraine’s seat of government, assuming little resistance. In fact, the trip seems to have taken about 24 hours. From the Financial Times:

Russia’s onslaught breached the suburbs of Kyiv on Friday as armoured columns battled towards Ukraine’s two biggest cities in Europe’s largest military offensive since the second world war. Kyiv residents woke to loud explosions shortly after 4am and reports of Russian armoured vehicles advancing into the northern Kyiv district of Obolon, bringing street fighting to the 3mn-strong capital. Western officials said that stronger than expected Ukrainian resistance on Thursday slowed Russia’s two key objectives of encircling Kyiv and capturing Kharkiv in the north-east, Ukraine’s second-biggest city. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky delivered an early morning address to his country as his army warned Russian troops were “moving at speed” towards central Kyiv followed by a column of military trucks.

(I’m assuing the troops heading toward Kyiv are coming South from Belarus, not West from the Donbas, or up from Crimea. I’m also assuming there won’t be a heroic last stand in Kyiv.)

Second, troops involved. Ukraine has an army nominally sized at 209,000. Russia’s troop count for the operation is opaque, but calculating from BBC figures, a little over 60,000 are involved. (60% of Russia’s troops are within 50km of the border, and half of those are “tactically deployed.”)

Third, casualties. From WikiPedia’s updating page:

Wars are bad, even small wars. At least that is the principle I think leadership should begin from. Of course, a small war can have large geopolitical effects, as this war doubtless will; the lightest touch can collapse a house of cards. And if you have a bet riding on that house of cards, a light touch can have enormous leverage. Nevertheless, as measured by the standards of our own wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya, or our sponsored wars in Yemen or Syria, this is a mercifully small war, both in troops and casualties. And if a war ends when a combatant’s capital is captured, this war will end soon (although I’m not sure it will, for reasons I will briefly explain below).

Back of the envelope calculations complete, I want to look at three topics. First, an old favorite: Digital evidence. Second, maps. Third, scenarios for what happens next.

Digital Evidence

First, my standard for visuals in war reporting is something like this (By Flag on the Reichstag, Fair use):

I don’t know if the Russians will be crass enough to raise a Russian over Ukraine’s Parliament, but if they did, that would be excellent proof they had really captured Kyiv, as opposed to, say, a Tik Tok video of the event.

Much of the digital evidence you see online is faked by amateurs. From Gizmodo:

Gizmodo has found at least ten viral photos and videos currently being spread on social media that are completely fake. In some cases, the videos and photos are years old. In others, the images are clearly not from Ukraine. There are even two examples of videos on Twitter today that are actually from war-themed video games, something Russian state media has previously tried to do on multiple occasions.

I don’t know why anybody would Tweet out a picture of an old war for the current war, but apparently people do. (I mean, one would expect official fakery to be more adept, although when we think back to Colin Powell’s vial of white powder, perhaps not.)

Other digital evidence you see online can be staged:

Servicemen of the Ukrainian National Guard take positions in central Kyiv, Ukraine February 25, 2022. REUTERS/Gleb Garanich pic.twitter.com/ohC4l1j4we — Idrees Ali (@idreesali114) February 25, 2022

At least we have the Reuters sigil, but from the commentary, these troops do not seem to have taken up actual combat positions.[2]

A second example:

The account (@brycewilsonAU) is real. Loading the photo into Google Image Search, I find the use in this tweet is the only example. So, interesting. However, I do think if a photographer had taken a wider angle shot of the Ukrainian National Guardsmen above, from farther away, the same theme would have emerged.

Then, quis custodiet ipsos custodes? Neiman Labs has a list of resources for following the war, but hilariously lists Bellingcat, the Atlantic Council’s cut-out to the Intertubes, which is a lot like putting the American Council of Pork Producers in charge of censoring fact-checking information on swine fever.

Finally, some common sense suggestions:

Be careful out there.

Maps

Of the several maps available, I will select the Financial Times, the BBC, and the New York Times.

First, the Financial Times:

You will note the lack of dynamism (no arrows) and the sketchy provenance of the data. Even a lowly site like PayDay report, when it puts a dot on their strike map, tells you where they got the data!

Second, the BBC:

Here we have arrows. It would be even nicer to have roads, so we could know if the tanks were moving by road or overland. The provenance is sketchy in the extreme, even worse than the FT.

Third, the New York Times:

Here we have both explosions for ground fighting and arrows (though the two seem to have little relation to each other). And the captions are handy. But the provenance is worst of all. We’re basing Times reporting on information from one of the combatants? Really?

These are not really maps. They’re graphics. designed to show what a child of six knows: That the Russians are attacking from the North, the East, and the South. (As with so much journalism, the point of these maps is not to convey information, but authority, or at least authoritativeness.)

Wtih relief, we turn to digital projects. Tnis is interesting:

Perhaps some readers would like to play around with the app. Of course, you should put your trust in digital evidence from these feeds as much as you would put your trust in any feed where war and peace are at stake; i.e., not at all. Fun, though!

And then there’s Google Maps. From Vice:

At 3:15 AM local time, Jeffrey Lewis, an open source intelligence (OSINT) expert and professor at Middlebury Institute, saw a traffic jam in Belgorod, Russia, using the traffic layer of Google Maps. “Someone’s on the move,” he tweeted…. Lewis said this wasn’t as simple as them loading up Google Maps and seeing a traffic jam, assuming it meant an invasion was occurring. They were also using optical and radar satellite imagery taken days before. On Tuesday, they had a radar picture taken by Capella Space, a company that provides satellite imagery, showing Russian armored and heavy vehicles lined up in columns ready to move. “We all looked at the picture, and was like, oh shit, it’s coming,” he said. As they were monitoring this unit, they noticed the traffic jam. “So it’s the prior work of knowing that there’s a giant Russian armored unit sitting right there that allowed us to say, like, oh, I know what that traffic jam is, they’re getting on the road.” Google Maps live traffic data works by incorporating location and speed information from Android phones. This led many commenters responding to his tweets to assume the Russian soldiers left their phones on—which would be horrendous cybersecurity hygiene—and Google was picking that up. But Lewis said that almost certainly was not the case, and the traffic data Google was showing was ordinary people who couldn’t get on the road because of Russian military movement. “We have developed incredibly data rich definitions of what normal patterns of life look like,” Lewis said, “And any deviation is immediately caught.”

Interesting, but sadly not happening in real time. There is also this Google map:

Here, at least you get sourcing when you click on a dot — yay! — but the map authorship is incredibly dubious: “This map is put together by a group of friends seeking to map the conflict.”

For all I know, there’s a dynamic map with full provenance out there on the Intertubes, but if there is, I haven’t found it. Readers?

Scenarios

Finally, in no particular order, I present some threaded tweetstorms on future scenarios for Ukraine. I take no view on any of them, but you may find them interesting to read and assess:

Scenarios (1):

Putin announced abstract objectives in his declaration of war, but his exact tactical and strategic goals remain unclear. I see at least five possibilities. THREAD — Serhiy Kudelia (@skudelia) February 24, 2022

Scenarios (2):

The international community is launching sanctions against Russia – but will they work? I've reviewed dozens of studies from experts, and the overwhelming answer is: maybe! (I know, not reassuring.) It's complicated, and depends on a lot of factors. Here's the breakdown🧵 pic.twitter.com/h9mVGmKGqa — Armand Domalewski (@ArmandDoma) February 24, 2022

Scenarios (3):

How will Russia's invasion of Ukraine play out? What is Putin's end game? I see four scenarios, none of which are good. [THREAD] pic.twitter.com/pAzIN57T7Z — Paul Poast (@ProfPaulPoast) February 24, 2022

I won’t venture to predict what the new “security model” for Europe will be, now that NATO”s house of cards has been shown to be wobbly, to say the least. However, I’m long stupid generally, and long stupid here, at least for the actions of the United States, which I know something about. I think we will fund and support an insurgency within Ukraine, no doubt using Azov Battalion types plus mercs and dupes, in an attempt to bleed Russia, dreaming of a Color Revolution. I doubt very much that will work even in its own terms, because we have form (losing) and Russia has form (winning)[2]. And if that means hardening the border with the EU, then (from Russia’s perspective) so be it. Notice this policy has continuity with previous US policy.

Conclusion

To fair, those who meme aren’t entirely good-for-nothings:

A friend in Kyiv just showed me this meme making the rounds today, and we both shared a laugh (we are sitting in an underground shelter right now).

It sums up the mood in Kyiv today as #Ukraine faces Russia’s invasion alone. pic.twitter.com/Qw5EJmtFCj — John Reed จอห์น รีด (@JohnReedwrites) February 25, 2022

Idea: Swap out Zelensky, swap in Juan Guaidó?
