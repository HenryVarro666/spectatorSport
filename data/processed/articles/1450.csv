The corridors will appear in an assortment of cities, according to Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk. They will offer residents a way to escape cities targeted by Russian forces and provide aid to those still there.

Ukraine will open multiple corridors in Mariupol, where Russian forces have targeted several civilian structures. ""Buses for Mariupol residents will be waiting in the square in front of the city sports complex in Berdyansk starting from 9:30 am. Departure to Zaporizhzhia is planned at 11:00 am,"" Vereshchuk said in a statement.

At least 190,000 people have been evacuated from war zones since the beginning of the war, Vereshchuk said on Saturday. While both governments agreed to establish humanitarian corridors for civilian evacuation on March 3, both governments have blamed the other for slowing the process. Ukrainian officials criticized the corridors set initially, which led directly into either Russia or Belarus.

There have been several reports in recent days of Russian forces targeting civilians. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin accused the Russian military of focusing its military attacks on civilian structures.

Details: 3,985 people arrived in Zaporizhzhia from Mariupol (Donetsk Region), travelling by 11 buses from Berdyansk and by private transport.

50 buses are scheduled to leave Zaporizhzhia for Mariupol on Monday morning.





Vereshchuk said that there is a hotline in Berdyansk that can be contacted for assistance with temporary accommodation and evacuation to Zaporizhzhia: +38 050 439 75 29, 3 62 76 and 3 52 52.

""We negotiated today to allow some of the buses to arrive and evacuate Mariupol residents from the town of Manhush tomorrow, as well as coastal settlements near Manhush, including Melekino,"" said the Deputy Prime Minister.

She gave a reminder that private cars belonging to Mariupol residents moving from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia continue to be refuelled in Berdyansk.

2,000 people were evacuated from the village of Bobryk to Brovary, and 1,310 people were evacuated from the village of Tarasivka to Brovary in the Kyiv region.

The evacuation from Borodyanka to the city of Bila Tserkva was disrupted for a second day in a row due to occupying forces violating the ceasefire, according to Vereshchuk.

Humanitarian aid was delivered to the village of Rohan in the Kharkiv region. However, the aid delivery to the village of Mala Rohan was disrupted because the Russians planned to seize the humanitarian convoy, according to Ukrainian intelligence.

Vereshchuk also shared information about people who were in the humanitarian convoy, which lost communication on the way to Vovchansk town. There are 5 drivers and 1 doctor among them:

Ambulance driver - Artem Vasylovych Kashkarov

Doctor - Artem Oleksandrovych Burda

Driver - Vladyslav Yuriyovych Honcharenko

Driver - Pavlo Viktorovych Pozin

Driver - Pavlo Oleksandrovych Korneyko

Driver - Oleksandr Ivanovych Maslov

The Ukrainian authorities are negotiating the return of these people, according to Vereshchuk.

She also urged citizens to be sympathetic to the shortcomings in the organisation of the evacuation since ""all this is the result of wartime realities.""",https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2022/03/20/7333150/

The latest: The weeks-long resistance in besieged Mariupol appeared to be cracking as Russian forces moved closer to capturing the seaside port city in southeastern Ukraine, with a Russian-imposed deadline for Ukrainian forces in the city to surrender passing early Sunday local time. Meanwhile, officials in the capital Kyiv and the western city of Lviv reported explosions Saturday. Moscow has withdrawn its forces from those regions to focus on eastern Ukraine, but airstrikes have continued.

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

DNIPRO, Ukraine — Ukrainian officials on Sunday accused Russia of bombing an art school in Mariupol where hundreds of people had been sheltering in recent days, but intense guerrilla warfare across the city hampered efforts to rescue survivors or count the dead under the rubble. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight About 400 women, children and elderly people had taken refuge inside Art School No. 12 in the Left Bank district of eastern Mariupol before it was bombed by Russia on Sunday, according to Mayor Vadym Boychenko and the city council. The Washington Post could not independently verify the claim.

Hundreds might be dead, the mayor said, but some of those sheltering at the school could have fled ahead of the bombing along evacuation routes that have opened up. “We still have to work it out,” Boychenko said. “This is what we are hoping.”

The allegation came days after a suspected Russian airstrike hit a theater, where the city estimates that about 800 people might have been sheltering, and 10 days after a deadly attack on a maternity hospital. The port city, which was besieged for weeks before Russian forces broke through Ukrainian lines, is considered an important strategic target for Russia because it offers a land link between annexed Crimea and areas of eastern Ukraine held by Moscow-backed separatists.

Late Sunday, Moscow called for Ukrainian forces to surrender and leave the city. Russian state media said that Mariupol leaders must either concede before the early hours of Monday morning or be considered “with the bandits.”

Boychenko said Saturday that thousands of people who had been sheltering in a sports hall in Mariupol had been deported at gunpoint to Russia. A woman whose family was in the hall told The Washington Post on Sunday that Russian troops had entered and told people to leave. People fled in vehicles and on foot, she said. They were guided onto roads into Russian-held territory in Ukraine where her family remained, she said. She said nobody took their documents.

The city council said captured residents have been taken to “filtration camps” in the town of Novoazovsk where their phones and documents are inspected before they are sent on to remote Russian cities. The woman said their family’s documents had not been taken and they were in Novoazovsk but hoped to make it back to Ukrainian-held territory.

On Saturday, Boychenko said the Russian actions were “familiar to the older generation, who saw the horrific events of World War II, when the Nazis forcibly captured people,” according to the Mariupol city council’s official Telegram channel.

“It is difficult to imagine that in the 21st century people will be forcibly deported to another country,” he said. “Not only are Russian troops destroying our peaceful Mariupol, they have gone even further and started deporting Mariupol residents.”

With communications cut and street fighting preventing rescue efforts at both the Mariupol Drama Theater and the art school, information on how many people might be trapped under the rubble is likely to remain scant until there is a lull, officials said. They said Russian forces are now present across the city.

They described fierce street-to-street combat, and said Ukrainian troops no longer held any ground in the city’s residential neighborhoods. Fleeing residents have described seeing Russian tanks and Russian-backed fighters from the breakaway eastern regions and Chechnya on the streets.

“They are in the center, in the periphery, they are everywhere,” Boychenko said. Russian gunships have been targeting the city for several days, he said.

Lt. Col. Sergiy Bachynskyj, a spokesman for the military hospital in Dnipro, nearly 200 miles northwest of Mariupol, said dozens of workers from the military hospital in Mariupol had evacuated in recent days. About 40 essential employees remained, he said.

Russian forces “are in all the civilian quarters right now,” he said.

Industrial areas linked to the city’s steel industry, meanwhile, were still in Ukrainian control. “It’s the main zone of fighting,” he said. “I’m not saying that there are no Ukrainian soldiers in other parts of the city; they just don’t control that territory.”

Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the Mariupol mayor’s office, said there was “no complete control on either side.”

“Who can talk about controlling, when one building is Russian-occupied, and one is Ukrainian military?” he said.

Rescue work at the theater bombed Wednesday has halted. “It’s not possible to get to this building,” Boychenko said.

Out of the 800 families the city believes had been sheltering there ahead of the bombing, some might have fled, he said. “A lot of people were getting out and evacuating,” he said. His own relatives had left that shelter the previous day.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said “hundreds” were trapped under the rubble.

About 100,000 people have evacuated Mariupol in recent days, according to the mayor. Thousands left on foot. Some crammed nine or 10 to a vehicle, windscreens smashed in and side panels dented by explosions.

Many left through designated “humanitarian corridors” through the front lines, but some say they have just driven straight along the highway.

Zelensky said 6,623 people were evacuated from hard-hit areas of Ukraine on Saturday, including 4,000 from Mariupol.

About 40,000 people who have left Mariupol in the past week have reached the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia or beyond, Boychenko said.

Others were in territory now controlled by Russia. Thousands are stranded in the coastal city of Berdyansk without gasoline. Buses ran back and forth from Zaporizhzhia to collect people.

One Ukrainian police officer said Mariupol has been “wiped off the face of the earth.” Residents have described clambering over rubble to get out.

Andryushchenko said “it was, is and always will be a Ukrainian city.”

“The Russian army can bomb everything in Mariupol, but that doesn’t mean Mariupol isn’t Ukrainian,” he said. “That’s why they are bombing it completely.”

As Russian troops advance, the Azovstal steel plant, one of the largest in Europe, was hit, local officials said. An unverified video circulating on social media showed a large cloud of black smoke emanating from the facility, followed by two smaller blasts. Officials and residents said Ukrainian troops were based in the industrial area. They described a heavy exchange of fire.

Enver Tskitishvili, the plant’s director, said the first strike hit a coal warehouse and the second fell “very close to the coke battery.” He said the plant shut down during World War II and was revived in its aftermath — a sign, he argued, that the plant would survive this latest strike.

“We will return to [Mariupol], we will rebuild this plant, we will revive it, and it will operate and bring glory to Ukraine as it always has,” Tskitishvili said, “because Mariupol is Ukraine, Azovstal is Ukraine — was, is and will be.”

European Union members split on Russia oil sanctions

The European Union’s foreign ministers have disagreed on whether and how to slap sanctions on Russia’s lucrative energy sector over its invasion of Ukraine, with Germany saying the bloc was too dependent on Russian oil to decide an embargo.

Lithuania’s Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis expressed impatience at the pace of talks after a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels, saying Europe should not give Russia more time to make profit.

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell called it “a massive war crime”, increasing pressure for action, but later told a news conference that while the bloc would “continue isolating Russia”, concrete decisions would be made at a later stage.

Putin is not giving #Ukraine a respite. On the opposite – he is ready to make it worse. Why should Europe give Putin more time to earn more money from oil and gas? More time to use European ports? More time to use unsanctioned Russian banks in Europe? Time to pull the plug. — Gabrielius Landsbergis (@GLandsbergis) March 21, 2022

Pentagon will help gather evidence of Russian war crimes in Ukraine

The Pentagon has said it will help gather evidence of Russian war crimes, as it accuses the Kremlin of carrying out indiscriminate attacks as part of an intentional strategy in the conflict.

“We certainly see clear evidence that Russian forces are committing war crimes and we are helping with the collecting of evidence of that,” Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby told a news briefing.

“But there are investigative processes that are going to go on, and we’re going to let that happen. We’re going to contribute to that investigative process. As for what would come out of that, that’s not a decision that the Pentagon leadership would make,” Kirby said.

“It’s not the answer to the Ukrainian war, but it is part of the answer,” EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said at a meeting of the bloc’s foreign and defence ministers.

The plan had been in the pipeline for two years but underwent a last-minute rewrite to increase the focus on the threat from Russia after Moscow invaded Ukraine.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has responded to reports of a crowd of peaceful protesters being shot at in the seized southern city of Kherson by calling Russian servicemen “war criminals” in a Twitter post.

US President Joe Biden had refrained from using the term, which has legal implications, until last week. The EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell called Russia’s attack on Mariupol “a massive war crime”.

Civilians rallied in Kherson despite pressure from the Russian occupiers who took over the city on March 3.

The administration of the Buchenwald Memorial complex said in a tweet that it was “stunned” by his killing on March 18.

Romanchenko was born in what is now Ukraine in 1926. He was taken to Buchenwald in 1942 and survived three more concentration camps, Ukrainian media reported.

Russia drops peace talks with Japan over Ukraine

Russia has announced it is abandoning talks with Japan aimed at signing a formal World War II peace treaty due to Tokyo’s response to Moscow’s military action in Ukraine.

“The Russian side, in the current conditions, does not intend to continue talks with Japan on the peace treaty due to the impossibility of discussing the core document on bilateral relations with a country that has taken an openly hostile position and is striving to cause harm to the interests of our country,” the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement.

Tokyo last week announced plans to revoke Russia’s most-favoured-nation trade status, expand the scope of asset freezes against Russian elites and ban imports of certain products over its incursion in Ukraine.

Russia and Japan have still not formally ended World War II hostilities because of a standoff over the islands known in Russia as the Kurils and in Japan as the Northern Territories.

Ukrainian defence minister accuses Russia of ‘state terrorism’

Russia is conducting “state terrorism” in Ukraine and will go on to attack other countries, Ukraine’s defence minister has said.

Speaking alongside British defence minister Ben Wallace during a visit to London, Oleksii Reznikov said 150 Ukrainian children had been killed since Russia invaded, with more than 400 schools and kindergartens and more than 110 hospitals destroyed.

“This is state terrorism. That is why (the) Kremlin must be stopped, because it will go further. It will attack other countries,” Reznikov said.

Russia summons US envoy, says ties close to rupturing after Biden’s remarks

Russia has summoned the United States ambassador to Moscow to warn him that remarks by Biden about Putin have pushed bilateral ties to the brink of collapse.

Biden said on March 16 that Putin was a “war criminal” for sending tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine.

“Such statements by the American president, which are not worthy of a high-ranking statesman, have put Russian-American relations on the verge of rupture,” Russia’s foreign ministry said in a statement as it announced the summoning of John Sullivan.

Ukrainian defence minister accuses Moscow of lying about troop death toll

The number of Russian troops killed in Ukraine far exceeds the Kremlin’s official death toll, Ukraine’s defence minister has claimed.

“The Kremlin no longer knows how to explain the things that are happening,” Reznikov wrote on Facebook.

“After all, these days, they buried more soldiers in the regions of Russia than they officially acknowledged their losses. Lies no longer help them, but the truth scares,” he added.

Kyiv says at least 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed during Russia’s incursion, a number that dwarfs the toll of 498 provided by Moscow on March 2 – the only time it has provided figures for its losses to date.

Al Jazeera was unable to independently verify the figures provided by either side.

Russian troops open fire at protesters in Kherson: Reports

Russian troops have fired on a crowd of protesters in Kherson, wounding several people, according to local media reports.

Footage posted on social media appeared to show demonstrators gathering in the southern Ukrainian city’s main square. The sound of automatic gunfire could be heard and people were seen running.

Some reports said Russian forces used stun grenades.

Al Jazeera was unable to independently verify the reports or the video footage.

Kherson has witnessed regular anti-Russia protests since Moscow’s forces took control of the city at the beginning of March – the most strategically significant capture of Ukrainian territory yet.

At least 925 civilians killed in Ukraine, UN says

The UN’s human rights office (OHCHR) says it has confirmed at least 925 civilians have been killed in Ukraine since Russia began its invasion on February 24, but warned the true toll is likely to be “considerably higher”.

Another 1,496 civilians have been injured as of midnight on Sunday amid Russia’s onslaught, according to OHCHR’s figures.

“Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes,” the organisation said in a statement.

“OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, especially in Government-controlled territory and especially in recent days, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration,” it added, citing several areas, including Mariupol.

“Through the country, Ukrainians have … stopped the Russian army and surprised the world,” Poroshenko told Al Jazeera from Kyiv.

“We are here to fight for the whole of Europe and fight for the whole world … we [will] stop Putin,” he added, before praising the “unique unity of the Ukrainians”.

“There is not any nation in the world that wants peace more than we [Ukrainians] do, but we never give up, and therefore it will be peace, not capitulation,” Poroshenko said.

“And if now we allow Putin to grab Ukraine, he will not stop, he will go as far as we, the world, allow him to go.”

Egyptian pound drops nearly 14 percent after Ukraine war prompts dollar flight

Egypt’s pound has depreciated by almost 14 percent after weeks of pressure on the currency as foreign investors pulled out billions of dollars from Egyptian treasury markets following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The pound dropped to 18.17-18.27 against the dollar, Refinitiv data showed, after having traded at around 15.7 pounds to the dollar since November 2020.

The downturn is likely to have a heavy toll on poor and middle-class Egyptians and came after the country’s central bank hiked interest rates by 100 basis points in a surprise overnight monetary policy meeting.

The central bank cited inflationary pressures triggered by the coronavirus pandemic and Russia’s war in Ukraine, which hiked oil prices to new records, as the basis for its decision.

‘No progress’ between Moscow, Kyiv on key issues: AJE correspondent

Al Jazeera’s Hashem Ahelbarra, reporting from Moscow, says the absence of a breakthrough in talks between Russia and Ukraine until now indicates there has been “no progress whatsoever” on the key issues dividing the two sides.

“From a Russian perspective, they want the Ukrainians to recognise Crimea as Russian and Luhansk and Donetsk as independent states,” he said, citing the Black Sea peninsula annexed by Moscow in 2014 and the two self-proclaimed separatist republics in eastern Ukraine.

“Then they would like to move forward with the idea of the neutral status of Ukraine – something that Ukraine has indicated it is open to – giving strong guarantees to the Russians that Ukraine won’t ever be contemplating the idea of joining NATO,” he added.

“The Russians say that the expansion of NATO eastwards has always been a major national security concern that was never addressed.”

EU warns of ‘huge risk’ of child trafficking as Ukrainians flee

The EU’s home affairs commissioner has warned that vulnerable Ukrainian children are in “huge” danger of being trafficked as they flee from Russia’s offensive.

Ylva Johansson told a news conference in Estonia that about half of the 3.3 million Ukrainians who had fled to EU countries since the start of the war were children.

Ukraine has a high number of orphans and children born through surrogate mothers who had not been picked up by their parents. That increased the risk that they could be abducted or become victims of forced adoptions, Johansson said.

“There is a huge risk of vulnerable children being trafficked,” she added, noting there had already been reports of such instances.

China will keep up ‘normal cooperation’ with Russia: Envoy

China’s ambassador to the US has defended his country’s refusal to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, contending such a rebuke will do nothing to stop the violence.

Qin Gang told the CBS television network’s Face the Nation on Sunday that China’s condemnation would not help and that he is doubtful it would have any effect on Russia.

He said China wants “friendly, good neighbourly relations with Russia” and will keep up “normal trade, economic, financial, energy cooperation with Russia” as it continues “to promote peace talks” and urge an immediate ceasefire from Russia through negotiation and diplomacy.

Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine is well into its fourth week. Today, March 19th, is the 24th day of Putin's war.

UPDATE (2119): Ukraine evacuated more than 6,623 people on March 18. More than 4,120 people left Mariupol for Zaporizhzhia. Some 1,820 evacuees left destroyed villages and towns in Kyiv Oblast. Some 675 people were evacuated from Luhansk Oblast.

UPDATE (2007): Invading Russian troops have been deporting Ukrainians to Russia by force, Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko has said in a statement.

Видео дня

During the last week, several thousand Mariupol residents have been taken to Russia by force, he said.

The invaders illegally removed people from the city's Left Bank district and shelters in the building of the city's sports club, where more than a thousand people (mostly women and children) had been hiding from the constant bombing.

Fighting took place in these areas. To save the lives of Mariupol residents, the Armed Forces of Ukraine withdrew from places crowded with civilians, and the aggressor took advantage of this.

It is known that the captured Mariupol residents were taken to filtration camps, where the invaders checked people's phones and documents. After the inspection, some Mariupol residents were redirected to remote cities in Russia, the fate of others remains unknown.



""What the invaders are doing today is familiar to the older generation, who saw the horrific events of World War II, when the Nazis forcibly captured people. It is hard to imagine that in the 21st century people would be forcibly deported to another country. Not only are Russian troops destroying our peaceful Mariupol, they have gone even further and started deporting Mariupol residents. All war crimes on the part of Russia should be punished the most severely, ”Boychenko said.

UPDATE (2000): In a phone conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan Russian, Russian dictator Vladimir Putin has spelled out his demands to Ukraine to end the war he started on Feb. 24.

Those are:

-Ukraine's neutrality. He wants Ukraine to denounce its aspirations for NATO membership;

- disarmament and guarantees of mutual security in the context of the Austrian model;

- ""Denazification"" - a baseless and false accusation against Ukrainians, which Putin has used as the motivation for a full-scale invasion of Russia;

- removing obstacles to the widespread use of the Russian language in Ukraine. Also a false claim, Russian is still dominant in Ukraine despite the state protection of Ukrainian as the only official language;

- recognition of the legitimacy of Russia's occupation of Crimea;

- recognition of self-proclaimed ""L / DNR"" as independent states within the borders of all Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.

According to Erdogan's spokesman, the latter points are ""the most difficult"" and unacceptable for Ukraine and the international community.

At the same time Ukraine's President Zelensky has publicly called Putin to meet him as the ""time has come to end this war and to restore Ukraine's territorial integrity.""

Due to the widespread speculations about the Russo-Ukrainian negotiations in the media, fears grow among Ukrainian public that Ukrainian government might accept some of the Russian demands. Ukraine's Parliament Head Ruslan Stefanchuk has said in an interview Ukraine might soon need to change its constitution with regard to its aspirations to join NATO.

UPDATE (1720): Kyiv Oblast is on the verge of flooding, the Kyiv Oblast Council has reported. The waters of the Irpin River have risen to dangerous levels after the Russian invaders blew up a nearby dam on Feb. 26. Vitaly Selyk, the head of the Urban Council of Kyiv NGO has said that one village is almost completely flooded, and there is a risk that several other villages will also be flooded.



Earlier in February, the Russian invaders fired a rocket at the Kyiv dam. Fortunately, Ukrainian air defense systems managed to destroy the rocket before it hit its target. If destroyed, the Kyiv Sea reservoir held back by the Kyiv dam could cause tremendous environmental damage, and will likely result in thousands of casualties in Kyiv and nearby regions.

Meanwhile, the Ukrainian government has finally counted how many Russian prisoners of war have been taken captive in Ukraine. Iryna Vereshchuk, Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister, has said that as of March 19, there are 562 Russian POWs in Ukraine. She also said that Ukraine will create a National Information Bureau aimed at accumulating and processing all data regarding Russian POWs, MIA soldiers from both sides, as well as civilians abducted by the Russian invaders. This new bureau will also systemize data about all Russian soldiers killed in action in Ukraine. Vereshchuk said that Ukraine has been cooperating with the Red Cross on this initiative since the start of the war, and has sent information on every Russian soldier identified to the organization.
