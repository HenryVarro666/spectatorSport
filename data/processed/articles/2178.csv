(Art. 7.)

Provisions of the Law

The Law on the Legal Regime of Martial Law, which was passed in 2015, regulates the mechanism of imposing temporary restrictions on the constitutional rights, freedoms, and legitimate interests of individuals and legal entities. (Law on the Legal Regime of Martial Law art. 1(1).) The special legal regime converts civilian authorities into military administrations at all levels of government. These military administrations are to include state emergency personnel, representatives of law enforcement agencies, and leaders of military formations located in the territory of the region or district. For military purposes, these administrations are subordinated to the chief of staff of the Ukrainian armed forces; for all other issues they are to follow orders issued by the Cabinet of Ministers. (Art. 4.) The president of Ukraine remains the head of the state and conducts strategic oversight of the armed forces during the period of martial law. (Art. 11.) The legislature cannot be dissolved during the legal regime of martial law. If the term of the Verkhovna Rada expires during the period of martial law, it continues its work until a new legislature is elected after the martial law regime is cancelled. (Art. 12.)

The imposition of military control over the country envisages the call of capable citizens for public works in support of the armed forces, other military formations, law enforcement, and civic protection, if the citizens were not mobilized for defense activities or reserved as essential employees for enterprises. The law allows the government to use the capacities and workforce resources of public and private enterprises for defense needs. A curfew can be ordered, and individuals may be subjected to a “special screening regime.” (Art. 8, paras. 1–6.)

This “screening regime” allows for restricting freedom of movement; conducting stricter ID checks; and inspecting belongings, vehicles, luggage, cargo, and residential and business premises. (Art. 8, paras. 6–10.) During the period of martial law, amending the Constitution, conducting referendums, organizing strikes, and holding public demonstrations and other mass gatherings are prohibited. (Art. 19.) Among other measures, the law gives the government the right to control the media; ban the sale of weapons, alcoholic beverages, and other toxic substances; regulate the production of medicines; and seize radioactive materials. (Art. 8, paras. 11–15.)

The law prohibits male citizens of Ukraine ages 18–60 from leaving their place of permanent residency without the approval of the local military administration. (Art. 8, para. 16.)

On February 23, 2022, before the invocation of martial law, the Ukrainian parliament approved a declaration of a state of emergency in the entire territory of Ukraine, except for the two eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.

The move to declare a state of emergency came after the president of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, signed decrees recognizing the two secessionist regions in eastern Ukraine as independent states.",https://www.loc.gov/item/global-legal-monitor/2022-03-03/ukraine-martial-law-introduced-in-response-to-russian-invasion/
3,3201eedc-eb36-40f3-a9c5-3f311b4013ee,[],,"The meaning of martial law

The phrase martial law dates back to the 1530s, with the adjective martial meaning “pertaining to the military” and ultimately taken from Mars, the Roman god of war.

The exercise of martial law generally occurs in one of two situations: 1) an invading force imposes itself on an occupied territory or 2) a civil authority transfers power over to the military to control a domestic situation.

Many ancient powers, including the Mongolian marauders and Alexander the Great, effectively ruled under martial law in their conquered territories. In more recent history, the American South was put under martial law by the Union Army in the aftermath of the Civil War and on the Hawaiian Islands after Pearl Harbor. In contemporary times, countries like Syria and Egypt have intermittently ceded to martial law during civil unrest.

The phrase and concept is especially associated with states of emergency, when civil leaders respond to dangerous circumstances, such as during natural disasters, violent protests, acts of terrorism, and coups d’état. When they are declared, states of emergency unusually give the military expanded powers of authority and many sometimes implement temporary martial law.

During the 2000–10s in countries including the US and Philippines, the increased militarization of local police forces and concerns over government suspension of the normal rule of law (e.g., as it applies to illegal immigrants or drug users) have led some citizens to fear the imposition of martial law on the citizenry. Here, martial law is associated with tyranny, oppression, and abuse of power.",https://www.dictionary.com/browse/martial-law

When martial law is in effect, the military commander of an area or country has unlimited authority to make and enforce laws. Martial law is justified when civilian authority has ceased to function, is completely absent, or has become ineffective. Further, martial law suspends all existing laws, as well as civil authority and the ordinary administration of justice. In the United States, martial law may be declared by proclamation of the President or a State governor, but such a formal proclamation is not necessary. Although the U.S. Constitution makes no specific provision for the imposition of martial law, nearly every State has a constitutional provision authorizing the government to impose martial law. The power of martial law, once held to be nearly absolute, has limitations; for example, civilians may not be tried by military tribunals as long as civilian courts are functional. Nonetheless, within the bounds of court decisions, a military commander's authority under martial law is virtually unlimited. Martial law has been declared nine times since World War II and, in five instances, was designed to counter resistance to Federal desegregation decrees in the South. Although a climate of mutual aid has always existed between the military and civilian law enforcement and should continue to exist, Department of Defense personnel are limited in what they can do to enforce civil law. Military personnel cannot be used in surveillance or undercover operations, and they may not be used as informants, investigators, or interrogators unless the investigation is a joint military-civilian operation in which the military has an interest in the case's outcome.",https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/martial-law-times-civil-disorder

Martial law has been used in many countires, but how does martial law work in the US? In the United States, the martial law definition refers to the military taking control of the civilian government in a particular area. Article 1 of the United States Constitution prohibits martial law by forbidding the military from intervening in public affairs. Although there are exceptions based on rebellion or situations in which public safety is significantly at risk, martial law is generally declared only when the traditional means of maintaining social order are no longer sufficient for keeping the public safe, such as war and natural disasters.

Martial law is subject to judicial review when declared in any part of the United States.

Even when martial law is declared in the United States, the governing body (i.e., the military) is still expected to uphold the Constitution. Meaning, constitutional rights cannot be suspended or violated during times of martial law.

Martial law is even subject to judicial review when declared in any part of the United States. This means that if the federal government declares martial law, then those individuals arrested by the military can petition a federal course to be released and invoke the right of habeas corpus. Interestingly, if the court considers the petition, the court can also decide whether the declaration of martial law was constitutional.

Usually, habeas corpus is put on hold when martial law is declared. Habeas corpus is a kind of law that states an arrested person must be brought before a judge or court before being imprisoned or punished. Given the freedoms most American citizens have, the lack of habeas corpus is quite controversial, hence why detained individuals can petition for this right to be reestablished.

Freedom of speech and the right to assemble are also rights placed on hold during periods of martial law.

Who Declares Martial Law?

In the United States, martial law may be declared by the proclamation of the president or a state governor, but such a formal proclamation is not necessary. The U.S. Constitution does not state any provisions for imposing martial law by the president, but almost every state's constitution has provisions sanctioning the government to enforce martial law.

The president, congress, and state governors can declare martial law in the United States.

Role of Congress

Technically, the United States Congress does have the power to declare martial law, but only within certain constraints that have been established by several court decisions between the American Civil War and World War II.

Congress has also passed several laws related to domestic military deployment to restrict the military's ability to control the federal government. However, these laws also grant the president power to utilize troops domestically in several ways that are not considered martial law but close to it.

For example, the Insurrection Act allows the president to deploy the military to assist civilian authorities with law enforcement as he chooses. Deployment of troops domestically under the statutes of the Insurrection Act may appear to be a declaration of martial law, which calls to action the need for these statutes to be defined more appropriately.

Martial Law in U.S. History

Throughout U.S. history, martial law has been declared at least 68 times by federal and state officials. Below are some of the most well-known events of martial law in U.S. history.

American Revolution

Martial law was evoked during the American Revolution as a result of the Boston Tea Party. During that time, parliament passed the Massachusetts Government Act (also known as one of the Intolerable Acts) to suppress town meetings, gatherings, and assemblies and impose an appointed government.

.!!Utah War

Governor Brigham Young declared martial law in 1857.

By 1857, the relationship between the Utah territory and U.S. federal government was strained due to Governor Brigham Young's semi-theocratic government. Young rejected the appointment of federal leaders and accepted polygamy. In 1857, President James Buchanan sent the federal military into the Utah territory, thus starting the Utah War.

On September 15, 1857, Utah's governor declared martial law in preparation for the upcoming war. He sent messages throughout the territory that the Mormons should allow no one to pass through the Utah territory without a permit from the proper officer. The war and enforcement of martial law ended with the removal of Brigham Young as governor. He was replaced by Alfred Cumming.

Great Chicago Fire (1871)

Chicago mayor Rowsell B. Mason declared martial law in response to the Great Chicago Fire on October 9, 1871, which placed General Philip Sheridan in charge of the city. However, martial law only lasted a few days; once the fire was extinguished, there were no more widespread disturbances in the city.

Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky has declared a state of martial law in his country in response to attacks from Russia on the Donbas region and other cities across Ukraine.

What is Martial Law?

Martial Law is defined as: ""The law administered by military forces that is invoked by a government in an emergency when the civilian law enforcement agencies are unable to maintain public order and safety.""

And in such an emergency situation, Zelensky has taken recourse to this law in an attempt to stabilise pro-separatist and Russian forces that are pushing to split up Ukraine.

Zelensky's message to Ukraine

In a statement on Thursday morning, Zelensky gave the Ukrainian public an update on the situation in the country.

""Dear Ukrainian citizens, this morning President [Vladimir] Putin announced a special military operation in Donbas. Russia conducted strikes on our military infrastructure and our border guards. There were blasts heard in many cities of Ukraine,"" he said.

""We're introducing martial law on the whole territory of our country. A minute ago, I had a conversation with President [Joe] Biden. The US have already started uniting international support.

""Today each of you should keep calm. Stay at home if you can. We are working. The army is working. The whole sector of defence and security is working.

""No panic. We are strong. We are ready for everything. We will win over everybody because we are Ukraine.""

Zelensky also revealed he had tried to contact Russian president Vladimir Putin on Wednesday but had been unsuccessful.",https://www.marca.com/en/lifestyle/world-news/2022/02/24/621761e5ca4741376e8b4598.html
