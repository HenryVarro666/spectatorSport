The transportation of the relief material was facilitated by International Humanitarian City in Dubai (IHC).

Here’s what we’ve seen so far:

Turkey has been testing its ties with Moscow by sending armed drones to Kyiv and invoking a 1936 treaty to limit Russian warships’ access to the Black Sea. But Ankara is also competing for the role of mediator, having hosted the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers in Antalya last week.

The US has barred imports of Russian oil and natural gas after failing to convince Saudi Arabia to increase oil production to offset global price increases that benefit Moscow.

Egypt and the United Arab Emirates have tread cautiously to avoid harming their ties with Moscow, while Israel has led with humanitarian aid and offered to mediate the conflict directly.

More than 3.25 million refugees have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion, the United Nations said on Friday, with more than two million crossing the Polish border.

UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, said 3,270,662 people had joined the exodus since February 24, another 100,765 since Thursday's update.

""We have seen a general slowdown"" in flow since the early days of the conflict, said UNHCR spokesman Matthew Saltmarsh.

As for people still within Ukraine who have left their homes, ""It's safe to assume the number is considerably higher than two million"", he said.

However, ""the pace and magnitude of the internal displacement and refugee exodus from Ukraine, as well as resulting humanitarian needs, will only increase if the situation deteriorates.""

Some 90 percent of those who have fled are women and children. Ukrainian men aged 18 to 60 are eligible for military call-up and cannot leave.
