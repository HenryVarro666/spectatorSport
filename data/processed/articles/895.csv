Spurred by reports of Russian atrocities outside Ukraine’s capital, and alarmed at signs that Russia’s invasion force is about to escalate assaults in eastern Ukraine, many civilians in that region are fleeing while they can, officials said Wednesday.

“The cities of the Luhansk region are in ruins,” warned one eastern governor. “Thousands of residents have not yet left. Get out of the way!”

The exodus accelerated as Western nations moved to provide more weapons to Ukraine’s military and further ostracize Russia economically with new sanctions, including restrictions on its leading banks and on the assets of President Vladimir V. Putin’s children.

The new sanctions are a response to outrage and revulsion over the atrocities, including executions and torture, that appear to have been carried out by Russian forces before they retreated from areas outside Kyiv in the past few weeks. Russia has denied responsibility, saying the atrocities were fabricated or were committed by the Ukrainians themselves.

The European Union also was weighing a ban on coal from Russia, the leading provider of fossil-fuel energy to Europe, and Russia appeared to move closer to default on its foreign debt because of U.S. currency restrictions.

“Together with our allies and our partners, we’re going to keep raising the economic costs and ratchet up the pain for Putin, and further increase Russia’s economic isolation,” said President Biden, who has described Mr. Putin as a war criminal and suggested he should not remain in power.

More than 11 million Ukrainians — roughly one in four — have fled their homes since the Feb. 24 invasion, according to the United Nations, including more than four million who have fled the country. It is the biggest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.

The Russian military announced last week that it would focus its campaign on eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting for eight years. The redeployment came as the Russians, hampered by botched planning and fierce Ukrainian military resistance, retreated from the Kyiv area and apparently abandoned — at least for now — any effort to capture the capital in their war to subjugate the former Soviet republic.

Western military analysts have said the Russians vastly underestimated the challenges in Ukraine and that their initial invasion force of more than 150,000 has been weakened by losses, exhaustion and low morale. But that does not mean Russia’s military cannot undertake a powerful new assault in eastern Ukraine.

The shift has accelerated civilian displacement in the east. Thousands of people have been leaving, according to Ukrainian officials, and photos and videos posted online. Ukrainian officials say Russian troops have been massing in the Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv regions.

In Kramatorsk, a city in the north of the Donetsk region, photos showed crowds of people huddled at a platform in a central train station.

At least two people were killed and five injured when Russian forces launched a strike on a humanitarian aid site in the town of Vugledar in the Donetsk region, according to Pavlo Kyrylenko, the Donetsk governor.

Russian forces now control 60 percent of the town of Rubizhne, in the Luhansk region, according to the governor there, Serhiy Haidai, who said the attackers had scaled up their offensive this week.

“Evacuations are taking place under the roar of enemy guns,” Mr. Haidai wrote in a Facebook post on Wednesday, saying that approximately 30,000 people had left the region since Russia invaded. He urged remaining residents to flee before Russia scaled up attacks.

Oleg Synegubov, the state administrator for the Kharkiv military region, said Wednesday in a post on Telegram that the army would evacuate two towns in the eastern part of the country because fighting was escalating there.

The towns, Lozova and Barvinkove, are southwest of Izium, a city Russian forces seized as part of an apparent drive toward Sloviansk, which military analysts say is strategically critical to Russia’s plan to gain full control of eastern Ukraine.

Earlier this week, Oleksiy Danilov, the head of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, speaking on national television, said “large groupings of Russian troops” had been massing in the region.

“They are not going to stop,” he said. “They have a great desire to create big problems for our armed forces in this direction, and we also expect that fierce battles will be fought there for our territory in the near future.”

The Pentagon’s assessment of Russian deployments appeared to corroborate what Ukrainian officials were saying. Pentagon officials said Russia had withdrawn all of its troops arrayed against Kyiv and another city in the north, Chernihiv, and sent them back to Russia or to its ally Belarus to rearm, resupply and possibly redeploy in eastern Ukraine.

The Pentagon officials said those forces included as many as 40,000 troops that, in many cases, had departed under fierce attack from the Ukrainian military units that retook the territory.

“We believe they are all out,” one senior Pentagon official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential operational issues.

Russia now has about 30 battalion tactical groups — as many as 30,000 troops — in the east, the senior Pentagon official said. Earlier this week, Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden’s national security adviser, said Russia would most likely send “tens of thousands of soldiers to the front line in Ukraine’s east” in the coming weeks.

Largely in anticipation of this next major phase of the war, the Pentagon announced late Tuesday that it was sending $100 million worth of Javelin anti-tank missiles — roughly several hundred missiles — to Ukraine, where the weapon has been used with high success in destroying Russian tanks and other armored vehicles.

NATO foreign ministers, meeting this week, have been discussing how to further help Ukraine prosecute the war without entangling the alliance in direct combat with Russian forces.

The war, they said, is far from over, noting that however badly Russia’s forces have performed, and their retreat from areas around Kyiv notwithstanding, they are making slow and brutal progress in the east.

“Moscow is not giving up its ambitions in Ukraine,” said Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary general.

Ukrainian officials in a number of areas, including Mykolayiv in the south and the Luhansk and Donetsk regions in the east, have been sharing schedules of planned evacuations or links to online portals for people to sign up to join buses and trains that are transporting residents to safer places.

But in some besieged cities in the south, like Mariupol, it is already nearly impossible to leave, making evacuations sporadic and risky.

Attempts by the Red Cross to enter Mariupol to supervise civilian departures have repeatedly been scrubbed, leaving fearful residents to fend for themselves. On Wednesday, 500 people who had escaped Mariupol to join a Red Cross convoy in the nearby city of Berdyansk arrived in Zaporizhzhia, about 100 miles away.

The climate of fear gripping Mariupol has spread to the region of Kherson, near the Black Sea, where people have lived under occupation by Russian forces since they encircled and entered the city and its suburbs on March 2.

“Anyone who did not leave early is now stuck here,” said Evgeniya Selivantseva, a doctor from Velyka Lepetyka, a village on the Dnipro River, in the Kherson region.

Dr. Selivantseva, 38, described a deepening humanitarian crisis in the village: Gasoline stations have run out of fuel, and food and medical supplies are running low. Food is so scarce that local leaders have started a makeshift flour mill.

“We feel helpless and totally defenseless,” she said. “People are afraid to leave their homes.”

The proposed European Union ban on Russian coal, part of the bloc’s effort to further penalize Russia over atrocities in Ukraine, reflected a choice of an imported energy source that would be the easiest to replace.

Deliberations over the ban and other sanctions were set to continue into Thursday, and European Union officials and diplomats anticipated that the measures would be approved. The process reflected the challenges of reaching agreement among all 27 member nations on the penalties, which would also include banning Russian ships from E.U. ports.

If approved, the sanctions would be the harshest enforced by the bloc since the invasion.

Though the European Union depends on Russian coal, the bloc could find substitute imports more easily than for natural gas and oil.

But banning coal from Russia could send energy prices soaring for European consumers, given the existing shortages in the bloc, according to Rystad Energy, a consulting firm. Carlos Torres Diaz, a senior vice president at Rystad, called the potential sanctions “a double-edged sword.”

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Russian President Vladimir Putin’s stated goals at the time were to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO, to demilitarize and to “de-Nazify” the neighboring country. It was the start of a war operation that is upturning the world order. A little over a month later, the Kremlin feels that the goals set out for phase one are being fulfilled “successfully.” A new phase is allegedly about to begin, focusing on “liberating” the Donbas region in southeastern Ukraine. But the facts, which include a series of setbacks leading to a significant withdrawal and reorganization of Russian troops, do not support this version of events. What is the balance of war so far?

Russia has been unable to capture Ukraine’s main cities – the capital Kyiv, Kharkiv, Mykolaiv and even the badly battered Mariupol are still holding out. Odessa remains free, and Ukrainian forces are regaining ground in several parts of the country. Russian troops are withdrawing from their positions on the northern front, and most particularly from their positions around Kyiv. Analysts with the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) believe that Russian forces have abandoned their efforts to capture Kharkiv, the second-largest city in Ukraine and the target of an intense offensive since the beginning of the invasion. Russian forces are still shelling the city, but seem to have given up on their attempts to encircle and control it.

The realization of failure on several lines of attack and the attrition of its forces is forcing the Kremlin to reorganize its deployment in Ukraine. There have been tremendous material losses.

“The first phase has been a Russian military failure of colossal proportions, a truly impressive thing. It will be the subject of study at military academies due to the accumulation of mistakes,” says François Heisbourg, a special advisor for France’s Foundation for Strategic Research (FFRS), the leading French center of expertise on international security and defense issues. The core cause, says Heisbourg, is an erroneous political analysis by the Kremlin that led officials to believe there would not be such a strong resistance by Ukrainians, a fact that also led to inadequate military planning.

“It’s been a disaster,” agrees Ruth Deyermond, a scholar at the Department of War Studies at King’s College London who specializes in security in the post-Soviet space. “We are observing great losses, communication and logistical failures, signs of corruption. They are being forced to resort to mercenaries, and they are withdrawing from Kyiv. No doubt Russia is losing the war. We cannot confidently say that Ukraine is winning, but we can clearly say that Russia is losing,” she says.

The following is an analysis of the combination of strategic and tactical factors that have led the warring sides to the point where they are at, in a war with an as yet uncertain outcome that will define an era. “The initial failure is not an indication of what will happen later,” warns Heisbourg. The conflict could be long and something could tip the balance of war again.

Land invasion

A shock force of between 150,000 and 190,000 Russian troops invaded Ukraine, organized into so-called BTG (Battalion Tactical Groups), the key operating unit of the Russian army. These are formations equipped with about 50 armored vehicles, designed to act with a high degree of autonomy and with great firepower. The United States estimates that Russia has deployed around 100 BTGs in Ukraine, which according to the Pentagon represents 75% of the total number of units at the Kremlin’s disposal.

Each BTG is modular and includes several companies with armored vehicles and artillery batteries. This is the most common structure: Tanks 1 company of 10 tanks T-80, T-72, T-90 or T-64 Not to scale Troop transport 1 company of 10 caterpillar-tread vehicles BMP-1, BMP-2 or BMP-3 1 or 2 companies of 10 troop transport vehicles BTR-60, BTR-70 or BTR-80 Each BMP and BTR vehicle carries seven soldiers Approximately 210 soldiers Taken together, a Battalion Tactical Group can have around 1,000 troops Artillery 2 or 3 batteries of 6 Mobile Howitzer self-propelled artillery systems Msta-SM2 1 battery of 6 rocket launchers MLRS B M-21, BM-27, B17 or TOS-1A 1 or 2 anti-aircraft batteries 2K22M1 Tunguska Or a mobile battery of surface-to-air missile system 9K33 Osa Support and logistics Support vehicles such as trucks to transport troops, engineering equipment, radar, control systems, mortars, etc. BREM-1 Each BTG is modular and includes several companies with armored vehicles and artillery batteries.

But these powerful units have been slowed down by numerous problems, including their own mistakes and the successes of the Ukrainian defense.

In tactical terms, Russia’s decision to advance by road straight towards its main urban targets made troop movements highly predictable and exposed them to ambush. Failures in equipment maintenance and logistics, and an often inadequate infantry protection of the flanks, aggravated their weakness.

This convoy of armored Russian vehicles had logistical problems during its slow advance towards Kyiv, during the last week of February. Maxar

In operational terms, the Pentagon has also observed failures in the chain of communication, with a growing reliance on unsafe lines. “The use of unencrypted lines has allowed Ukrainian forces to locate and kill several Russian generals,” says Deyermond.

Overall, command and control have shown signs of ineffectiveness in dealing with an operation of a scale not experienced in decades by Russian forces. And a hierarchical structure that rarely delegates to middle management has reduced agility.

The scope of Russian targets has led to troop dispersal on the ground. However, this has not prevented them from achieving clear supremacy on the fronts.

Ukrainian forces have made the most of this situation, striking the Russian columns repeatedly with anti-tank weapons such as Javelins, or from the sky with drones.

Heisbourg underscores three key factors behind Ukraine’s achievements: “A brave combat spirit, weapons delivered by the West, and training by Western countries that has given Ukraine a better organizational ability than the Russians, who are very uncoordinated.”

The desire to defend one’s country and fellow citizens is a motivational element that is hard to beat. And President Zelenskiy has been an inspirational leader.

Weapons supplied by the West, even if they lack sophisticated systems, are proving to be of great use for the type of combat that is taking place in Ukraine.

Besides that, Ukrainian forces are no doubt benefiting from important intelligence and advisory support from the West. Espionage, satellite observation technology and cyberdefense support from Western public agencies and private companies – including Microsoft and Starlink – are all proving to be important factors.

The absence of a large-scale cyberattack has surprised many. “That’s not to say that we haven’t seen cyber in this conflict. We have – and lots of it. We’ve seen sustained intent from Russia to disrupt Ukrainian government and military systems‚” said Sir Jeremy Fleming, Director of Britain’s General Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), in recent statements. But there have been no significant effects.

Ukraine has also benefited from Russia’s inability to achieve air supremacy, a fact that has puzzled many experts. This is fundamentally due to Russia’s failure to strike Ukrainian anti-aircraft defenses, largely because of imprecise information about their location or during strikes. Russia has launched many attacks and caused a lot of destruction, but it has failed to decisively degrade Ukraine’s military abilities.

Missile offensive

From the beginning, Russia has sought to make the most of its ample missile potential. According to a Pentagon tally, by March 31 the country had launched over 1,400 cruise and ballistic missiles.

80 from Belarus 300 from Russia 400 from Ukraine Where the first 800 missiles that hit Ukraine were launched from: 6 from the Black Sea 80 from Belarus 300 from Russia Where the first 800 missiles that hit Ukraine were launched from: 400 from Ukraine 6 from the Black Sea

Launch systems

Russia has a large arsenal of missiles thanks to decades of defense industry development, first under the Soviet Union and later under President Vladimir Putin’s renewed drive. The star of the arsenal is very likely the Iskander-M, which can shoot short-range ballistic missiles. The army has also used Kalibr cruise missiles, and Moscow claims to have deployed a Kinzhal hypersonic missile.

Defending against missile attacks is extremely difficult, and even the world’s most advanced armed forces have limited intercept capabilities. Ukraine has a S-300 anti-missile system designed in Soviet times and developed at a later date.

At first, Russia picked targets that were clearly military in nature, with the goal of undermining its opponent’s operational capabilities. But progressively it has been including civilian targets as well, ranging from broadcasting towers to shopping malls and even hospitals.

The Pentagon believes that Russia is still sitting on a large stash of ballistic and cruise missiles, but that it might be running short of precision-guided missiles, forcing it to use increasingly inaccurate weapons as the conflict drags on.

Russia’s remarkable missile capacity has caused a lot of damage but has failed to undermine Ukrainian resistance, both in terms of military capability and popular resolve.

Air combat

Russia’s inability to neutralize Ukraine’s anti-aircraft defense is conditioning the operability of Russian aviation, which cannot move as it wishes within Ukrainian airspace. This represents a limitation on Russian air raids to protect their advancing ground forces or to strike targets. The Pentagon has estimated that Russia is using 60% of its air force in Ukraine.





Washington believes that Russian aircraft have been going out on approximately 250 to 340 missions a day, but that many of these have not penetrated into Ukrainian territory or only in a limited manner. Ukrainian aircraft, for their part, are flying five to 10 missions a day.

Besides the S-300, which are quite efficient against airplanes, Ukrainian forces are being supplied with significant amounts of portable Stinger missiles, which are dangerous for low-flying aircraft.

Urban warfare

Russia has been unable to capture Ukraine’s major cities, which would have effectively subjugated the country. Wresting control of the cities from an adversary as determined as the Ukrainian defense involves launching ground attacks, which are among the most dangerous kind of action for any army.

Military experts note that urban combat gives the advantage to the defender, who has many opportunities for hiding.

The attacker could also choose to bomb the city intensely. If he is prepared to accept the ignominy of completely gutting the target, this would certainly clear the way forward. If, instead, he manages to encircle the city completely, it could prevent delivery of essential supplies. But until either of those situations comes to pass, if ever, the defense is keeping up the fight and any Russian incursion will mean exposing the latter’s soldiers to attacks.

Conclusion

Conflicts are dynamic. Like Heisbourg notes, the circumstances that have defined the first month and a half of conflict are not necessarily an indication of how things will turn out in the end. Besides that, available information is neither comprehensive nor transparent.

Available data suggests that Russia is inflicting tremendous damage on Ukraine. It has made huge inroads into Ukrainian territory and its potential for dragging out the war is significant. What’s more, it has managed to get the government in Kyiv to openly talk about negotiating a neutral status for Ukraine as part of a potential peace deal.

But Russia has also sustained tremendous losses in a little over a month. The fact that authorities have admitted to 5,000 casualties, including the dead and the injured, is already remarkable in itself, but it means that the reality is probably a lot worse than Moscow is admitting. Material losses have been huge as well. Rebuilding these forces, notes Heisbourg, will prove extremely tricky given the sanctions that Russia’s defense industry has been hit with and the strong dependence of several sectors. This reality will define Russia’s military future beyond the effects of the Ukraine war.

This operation is showing the world the limitations of Russian forces, which were believed to be modernized and world-class level. “But that is not the case,” adds Deyermond.

On the economic front, Russia continues to earn money from its hydrocarbon exports. Following an initial and sudden collapse, the ruble is gaining lost ground. But the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) recently forecast that Russia’s GDP will contract 10% in 2022, while the inflation rate remains above 15%. The brain drain is also cause for concern in Moscow. It is a complex situation for a country trying to keep up the war effort.

Nobody beyond Putin’s closest circle knows what the Kremlin’s original plans and expectations might have been. Judging by public statements, it would appear that the goal of “demilitarizing” Ukraine is nowhere in sight. As for its “de-Nazification,” this is an ambiguous concept, but the general logic of Russia’s rhetoric would indicate that it essentially means a regime change in Kyiv. This does not appear to be imminent, either.

What Ukrainian President Zelenskiy has accepted is to discuss his country’s neutrality and drop his ambition to join NATO. But he is only willing to do so in exchange for guarantees that resemble those included in Article 5 of the NATO Treaty. “In any case, NATO membership was never really in the cards, so achieving this in exchange for so many losses could hardly be considered a positive result for Moscow.” For now, Kyiv is not capitulating to Moscow’s territorial claims, although it is willing to temporarily put the contentious issue of Crimea on hold.

Whatever the actual goals and expectation of the Kremlin, its use of the term “success” to describe the situation has little basis in facts. The elements on view at the moment do not paint a picture of Russian victory.

Russian forces appear to be reorganizing in order to focus their efforts on the eastern Donbas region. This might grant them improved attack capabilities. They will likely attempt to encircle Ukrainian forces in the area, squeezing them between Russian positions in the north and the south. But Deyermond stresses that the initial phase of the operation has led to significant attrition: Russian troop morale is low, and so is the ability to bring in fresh equipment and forces. Ukraine’s spirits, on the other hand, remain high.

Time will tell whether this initial phase of the war is just the beginning of a new case of military defeat by an invading power with superior strength, just like the USSR and the US experienced in Afghanistan.

So why not give older versions of these planes to Ukraine? The official Twitter account for the Air Force of Ukraine publicly requested that NATO provide them with Western fighter jets like the F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-15 Eagle to aid them in their fight against Russia last week. According to the social media statement, Ukraine’s Air Force sees securing these fighters as essential to the defense of their nation, as they offer advanced systems that are on par or superior to those of the Russian Air Force.

According to Ukraine, their pilots could be trained and ready to fly these American jets into combat after just two or three weeks of training, but the truth is, flying the F-15 or F-16 into the fight takes a whole lot more than a moderately trained pilot. While it may not take long for these aviators to learn how to execute the fundamentals of flying in a new cockpit, combat is a test like few others. Even for American fighter pilots, who spend more time in their cockpits than pilots hailing from most other nations, survival in combat is never assured—let alone victory.

Unfortunately for Ukraine’s Air Force, this is one request that will very likely be denied.

Ukraine’s Air Force has fought courageously to keep the airspace over their embattled nation contested, not allowing Russia’s superior numbers or technology to take the skies from them, despite the odds. In the minds of many, this presents an opportunity for America’s high-performance 4th generation fighters to press the Russian military back toward its own borders, especially as Russian forces retreat and reposition to focus their efforts on Donbas, in Eastern Ukraine.

But the truth is, providing Ukraine with aircraft like the multi-purpose dynamo F-16 or the air superiority champ F-15 is a much bigger ask than many may realize. Not only would doing so be a massive undertaking, it likely wouldn’t offer a significant benefit over alternative—less risky—means of providing support.

Why does Ukraine want the F-15 and F-16 if they don’t fly them?

Despite growing increasingly friendly with the West in recent years, Ukraine’s stockpiles of military equipment remain largely comprised of Soviet-era tech, and that includes their Air Force. While the F-15 and F-16 have been flying since the 1970s, Ukraine has been operating two very different fighters: the Sukhoi Su-27 and Mikoyan MiG-29. This is why previous efforts to funnel fighters into Ukraine centered around Poland’s fleet of MiG-29s, which were seen as the easiest jets to transition Ukrainian pilots into.

If we’re going by the dates these aircraft entered service, Ukraine’s are technically newer designs than America’s Fighting Falcon and Eagle, with the MiG-29 first joining Russia’s operational fleets in 1982 and the Su-27 joining in 1985, versus the F-16’s 1978 and F-15’s 1976. In fact, these Soviet fighters were developed specifically to compete with the very American fighters Ukraine is requesting (just as the American jets in question were developed to out-compete the previous slew of Soviet fighters).

However, in the intervening decades, America and its allies have consistently updated their respective fleets of 4th generation fighter platforms, turning these relics of the Cold War into extremely capable modern-day aircraft. These jets may lack the ability to defeat or postpone radar detection like their newer stealth counterparts, but are none the less capable of operating in heavy combat environments with a high degree of success.

Russia’s aircraft have seen similar upgrades, giving them the clear advantage over Ukrainian aviators in this conflict. As such, Ukraine believes better Western fighters could give them the edge they need to dominate portions of Ukraine’s airspace.

They have good reason to suspect NATO fighters would do the trick. The F-16 was originally meant to be a lightweight air superiority fighter that has since demonstrated a great deal of value as a multi-role platform. The F-15 comes with an even more impressive reputation, and in fact, the Eagle is the most dominant air superiority fighter of its era (and perhaps others). With a reported combat record of 104 air victories and zero losses, there is not another fighter in the sky with the proven dogfighting chops of the F-15.

It takes at least 6 weeks to help trained American fighter pilots transition to the F-16 from another jet

Because Ukraine’s pilots are accustomed to the cockpits of Soviet-era fighters, it would take some real getting used to before they could effectively fly the F-16 or F-15 in combat. Ukraine claims they could make the transition in a matter of just two or three weeks, and while this seems extremely unlikely, it may be feasible given the nation’s difficult circumstances.

The Air Force actually already has a course designed to train existing fighter pilots to get behind the stick of an F-16 Fighting Falcon, and although these pilots are already accustomed to American fighters (as Ukrainian pilots would not be), the course still takes over six weeks. It’s possible that Ukrainian pilots could considerably condense this training course, but the chances that they would leave their crash course with a high degree of competence in their new aircraft seems unlikely.

But importantly, Ukraine has never operated these aircraft, so simply landing a few of these jets on a Ukrainian airstrip and tossing them the keys wouldn’t be enough to actually fly these jets in combat.

In fact, getting the aircraft into Ukraine would probably be the easy part.

The Air Force uses 25 maintainers for every one tactical aircraft

While all fighter jets are not created equal, there is one universal truth when it comes to operating them: it takes a ton of maintenance, even for aircraft like the F-16 that is renowned for being fairly inexpensive to operate. In fact, as a general rule of thumb, each F-16 requires about 16 hours of maintenance for every one hour spent flying.

It’s not a simple matter of having a few well-trained aircraft mechanics standing by to fix whatever ails a jet either—these are highly specialized pieces of equipment that require equally specialized training to maintain, let alone repair.

According to the U.S. Air Force’s 332d Air Expeditionary Wing, which operates both the F-15E Strike Eagle and F-16C Fighting Falcon (among other aircraft), it takes a ratio of 25 maintainers to every one aircraft to keep their equipment in good working order. Of course, it could be done with fewer techs, but hard combat flying will undoubtedly require more maintenance and repairs than standard training flights might.

“It’s a constant double and triple checking,” said Senior Airman Griffin Langiano, maintenance crew chief. “There are so many moving parts, and if you don’t take your time it’s easy to miss something. We have to be 100 percent positive the plane is mission capable.”

This includes individuals conducting pre-flight, thru-flight, and post-flight safety checks (thru-flight means landing to re-arm before departing to continue a mission), as well as several more specialized groups called “back shops.”

These “back shop” maintainers specialize in more specific skill sets like maintaining or repairing weapons, guidance or propulsion systems. These jobs aren’t just essential to continuing air combat operations, they’re serious business. A single misplaced socket or poorly secured panel could result in a deadly crash.

“(Maintainers) have more responsibility than the majority of Airmen in the Air Force,” explained 1st Lt. Tate Ashton, 391st Fighter Squadron Sortie Generation Flight commander.

“Nobody else is held to a higher level of accountability than they are.”

Flying a fighter in combat means continuously pushing it to the limits of capability, and that means placing the airframe and other components under a huge amount of stress. Keeping these jets in flying condition takes a great deal of training. In order to become an Air Force tactical aircraft maintenance technician, Airmen must complete five advanced training courses at Sheppard Air Force Base in Wichita Falls, Texas. It takes each technician about 18 months to complete their job-specific training (on top of things like basic training) before they’re sent to their fleet units where they’ll continue to undergo on-the-job training until they’re fully proficient at their jobs.

These highly-trained maintenance techs then rely on specialized equipment and a massive logistical enterprise to keep them supplied with the materials they need to maintain their aircraft. This would require new infrastructure Ukraine doesn’t already have, from a place to put specialized equipment to a means to get regular shipments of Western parts to Ukrainian airstrips. Again, the goal would be to accomplish all of this without sending NATO troops into Ukraine.

Even if Ukraine could train its pilots to be competent in the F-16 and F-15 cockpits in just a matter of weeks (which, in itself, is extremely unlikely), they could never train enough airframe maintainers in that time. But let’s pretend they could do that too… then they’d still be facing another serious hurdle when it comes to ordnance.

The weapons fighter jets use need technicians (and logistics) too

You may not realize it if you’ve never spent much time on the flight line, but the weapons employed by fighter jets like America’s F-15 and F-16 are entirely different than those employed by the Soviet-era fighters in service for Ukraine. You can’t simply strap a Russian R-27 air-to-air missile to an F-16 and assume it’ll work when you pull the trigger. Modern air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles and even many modern bombs are complex pieces of technology that require specific mounting hardware and specially trained technicians to be employed successfully.

Air Force Aircraft Armament Systems Specialists are tasked with arming America’s F-15 and F-16 fleets, and Ukraine would need similarly trained personnel on their own airstrips. This too requires a great deal of in-depth training (somewhere between 45 and 86 days’ worth, according to the Air Force).

Of course, Ukraine already has weapons technicians, so it may not take the same amount of time to spin them up regarding how to properly arm these aircraft, but it certainly isn’t something that could be done overnight.

But just as importantly, Ukraine would need a steady supply of munitions specific to each of these aircraft in order for them to provide any real value in the fight. Ukraine is already receiving weapons from external sources, so while some of this infrastructure work has already been done, it would require a significant effort to keep the flow of weapons and parts coming to Ukraine’s airstrips as Russian forces target the supply line in an effort to get these jets out of the fight.

Ukraine would have to take F-15s and F-16s into Russia to win the skies

As we’ve already discussed regarding the establishment of a NATO-enforced no-fly zone over Ukraine, advanced Russian air defense systems like the S-400 Triumpf have an operational range of around 250 miles. That means Ukrainian fighters would need to engage air defense systems inside Russia and potentially even Belarus in order to take control of their airspace (as multiple Ukrainian officials and pilots have championed as part of the request for these fighters). Otherwise, these air defense platforms could continue to shoot down Ukrainian jets that strayed too close to Russian territory.

But Russian air defense systems aren’t the biggest reason Ukraine would need to send its newly-gained F-15 and F-16 fleets into Russia—the biggest reason is that most Russian airstrikes are launched by aircraft that never leave Russian airspace.

Because Ukraine is located directly on Russia’s border, Russian forces have the ability to fly hundreds of sorties per day, launching missiles toward Ukrainian targets without ever actually flying across the border into Ukraine itself. Likewise, Russian integrated air defense systems rely heavily on airborne AWACS (airborne early warning and control systems) to extend their reach beyond the curvature of the earth. Ukraine’s F-15s and F-16s tasked with stopping the onslaught of Russian airstrikes would have no choice but to fly into Russia to engage fighters, bombers, and AWACS supporting these airstrike operations.

This poses a problem for NATO nations who would be supplying Ukraine with not just the aircraft, but the training, equipment, and munitions needed to operate them. Ukrainian F-15s and F-16s entering Russian airspace would undoubtedly look less like the West was providing defensive support and more like it was equipping Ukraine to take an offensive into Russia. This dramatically increases the likelihood of conflict expanding beyond Ukraine’s borders, as bringing the fight into Russia may prompt the Russian government to respond by engaging facilities and logistical supply lines that support Ukraine beyond its own borders, in places like Poland, in order to neutralize the threat posed by these American fighter aircraft.

Ukraine would lose a lot of fighters and the war would go on

There is no chance that NATO could provide Ukraine with enough F-15 or F-16 airframes to offset Russia’s massive numerical advantage in the region. All told, Russia has some 1,500 combat aircraft, making it the second-largest air force in the world. Ukraine began the war with fewer than 100, and now has closer to 50. Providing Ukraine with even dozens of western fighters (which is extremely unlikely) wouldn’t be enough to put them on even footing.

Instead, Ukrainian pilots in jets they only barely knew would fly into combat against Russian pilots who have trained in their own respective aircraft for years. Then they’d land their fighters on airstrips that would be targetted for repeated missile strikes, where techs and maintainers who only have a few weeks’ training on these platforms would have to turn them around and get them back into the fight extremely quickly, just to do it all again against the same overwhelming odds. This is a recipe for a lot of downed jets and a lot of dead, injured, or captured pilots.

Even if things went exceedingly well for Ukrainian aviators, as they have certainly demonstrated their ability to do a great deal with very little, this influx of fighters (along with all the required training, equipment, materials, and munitions) would not be enough to push Russian forces back into their own territory. Russia has more than 150,000 troops operating in Ukraine.

So while providing these jets could create a situation that sees the conflict grow beyond Ukraine’s borders, it’s unlikely that it, in itself, would be enough to end the fighting inside Ukraine either.

As many have pointed out, it’s significantly more cost-effective to control Ukrainian airspace using air defense systems than it is to provide fighter jets to do the same job. Air defense systems, of course, also require training and logistics, but by supplying Ukraine with systems they already operate like the Soviet S-300, operated by a small number of NATO nations, they could engage Russian aircraft and even cruise missiles without the need for additional training or equipment infrastructure.

These systems wouldn’t be capable of engaging Russian aircraft in Russia like fighter jets would… but that is indeed one of the reasons it’s a more tenable option. Of course, a limited supply of these air defense systems (as well as the munitions they fire) is a concern, just as it was with previous efforts to send Ukraine MiG-29s.

Ultimately, Ukraine may be asking for F-15 and F-16 fleets because they know having some fighters—even ones they may struggle to operate—is obviously better than none. But based on the fairly limited value these aircraft could provide in securing Ukraine’s airspace, even in engaging ground targets in airstrikes while heavily outnumbered and being targetted by Russian air defenses inside and outside of Ukraine, it simply isn’t the most effective or viable way to provide support.

Ukraine needs help—and a great deal of it at that—but the aim has to be protecting the people of Ukraine without expanding the conflict into a greater war. Providing Ukraine with F-15 or F-16 airframes would certainly help them, but not enough to be worth the cost or the risk when compared to other options.

Blinken says US supporting Ukraine to increase pressure on Moscow

The United States wants to see the war in Ukraine “come to an end as quickly as possible” and is supporting Ukraine to increase pressure on Russia, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said.

“That’s exactly why we’re making sure that we’re doing everything we can to support Ukraine and to give them the assistance that they need to put pressure … on Russia,” Blinken said.

Blinken said he believed Ukraine can also win the war because “success” and victory is “holding on to the sovereignty and independence of their country”.

“The problem is it may take time, and in the meantime, tremendous death and destruction. But what is so powerful here is that the Ukrainians have made it very clear that they will not subjugate themselves to Vladimir Putin’s will.”

Russian far-right politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky dies at 75

Russian far-right politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky has died after a long illness, the speaker of the country’s parliament says.

Zhirinovsky, 75, was admitted to hospital earlier this year after contracting COVID-19, according to Russian media, and was too ill to speak out publicly on the war in Ukraine. He had for decades aired anti-Western grievances that found an echo in President Vladimir Putin’s increasingly bitter rhetoric in the run-up to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

“Always, in any audience, in the most heated discussions, he defended the patriotic position, the interests of Russia,” Putin said in a tribute.

Mariupol mayor accuses Russia of ‘burning’ corpses to try and cover up civilian killings

Mariupol’s mayor has accused Russia of attempting to cover up what he said was the killing of possibly “tens of thousands of civilians” in the city by using mobile crematoriums to burn corpses.

“One week ago, cautious estimates put the death toll at 5,000. But given the size of the city, catastrophic destruction, the duration of the blockade and fierce resistance, tens of thousands of civilians from Mariupol could have fallen victim to the occupiers,” Vadym Boychenko said in a post on Telegram.

“The world has not seen the scale of the tragedy in Mariupol since the Nazi concentration camps,” Boychenko said, accusing Russia of turning the city into a “death camp”.

Author of the mural Sasha Korban

Today is April 6. Russia's military attack on Ukraine has been going on for six weeks. We're reporting on all the current news.

What about today?

Key points

The Air Force Command notes that the territory of the russian horde has changed the tactics of combat operations in the air; the russians are trying not to enter the zone of the defeat of our air defense and don't come into direct contact with the fighter jets. Instead, the enemy strikes missiles from the air, in particular from the airspace of Belarus.

Given this, our air defense is working non-stop; on Tuesday, April 5, the Air Force shot down eight cruise missiles of the russian occupiers.

Already 18,600 russian occupiers have died on Ukrainian land. The other day the jubilee 150th enemy plane was shot down!

The Security Service of Ukraine has obtained secret maps and lists of russian occupiers who were destroyed by the Ukrainian army in the Donetsk region. ""The maps were registered on February 22 and contain the occupiers' plans to seize the entire territory of Donetsk region,"" the SBU said in a statement. All documents will be included in the materials of criminal proceedings as evidence of the crimes of russians and putin personally for international courts.

""We are aware that the occupiers outnumber us. That they have more equipment. But we have no other choice, the fate of our people is being decided. We know what we are fighting for. And we are doing everything to win,"" Zelenskyy said in a new video message.

The UN confirms 1,500 victims since the start of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine. In fact, there are many more who have been killed and maimed by the occupiers.

The only way to prevent the expansion of the russian war outside Ukraine is to give us the fullest support, said Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. ""Maximum sanctions. All weapons. The policy of 'not provoking putin' has failed in recent years. Help us curb this evil now or risk putin checking Article 5 (NATO article that an attack on one member of the bloc is an attack on the whole bloc) later,"" Kuleba wrote.

Deputy Head of the Office of the President, Oleh Tatarov, allowed viktor medvedchuk, andrii portnov, and portnov's son to escape. This was stated by the Center for Combating Corruption. In addition, according to the CCC, tatarov is trying to unlock the accounts of the company of putin's oligarch Deripaska frozen in Ukraine (Mykolaiv Alumina Plant). How many more traitors will we learn about?

The Verkhovna Rada registered a draft resolution recognizing russia's actions in Ukraine as genocide.

The commander of the Georgian Legion fighting for Ukraine, Mamuk Mamulashvili, has stated that his unit will not take russian soldiers captive.

Humanitarian corridors

Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said she intended to evacuate Mariupol residents by a water corridor on a Turkish ship: ""There's a preliminary agreement between Erdogan and putin about opening a sea corridor for the Turkish ship to enter the Berdiansk port and take away about 100 wounded civilians, women, children, and Turkish citizens. Turkey wants to save its citizens and help us agree on a humanitarian corridor,"" Vereshchuk explained. According to her, negotiations on this corridor continue. She added that all routes and logistics are ready, but russia is pulling back.

As of April 6, 2022, 11 humanitarian corridors have been agreed upon:

From Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia by personal transport.

From Berdyansk to Zaporizhzhia by personal transport and buses.

From Tokmak to Zaporizhzhia by personal transport and buses.

From the city of Energodar to Zaporizhzhia by personal transport.

From the city of Gulyaypole to Zaporizhzhia by personal transport. Buses from the city of Zaporizhzhia with humanitarian aid will also be sent.

From the city of Melitopol to Zaporizhzhia by personal transport. Buses from the city of Zaporizhzhia with humanitarian aid will also be sent.

From Severodonetsk to Bakhmut. Meeting place: 28 Khimikiv Avenue.

From Lysychansk to Bakhmut. Meeting place: RTI, 40 Rokiv Peremohy, 324 Sosiury Street

From Popasna to Bakhmut. Meeting place: 42 Pervomaiska Street.

From the village of Hirske to the town of Bakhmut. Meeting place: 13 Haharina Street.

From Rubizhne to Bakhmut.

Residents of the Luhansk region are asked to evacuate from the region as much as possible. There will be five ""humanitarian corridors"" for evacuation today. Meeting places:

Severodonetsk: 28 Khimikiv Avenue;

Lysychansk: RTI, 40 Rokiv Peremohy, 324 Sosiury Street

Popasna: 42 Pervomaiska Street;

Hirske: 13a Haharina Street;

Nyzhne: 13 Parova Street;

Rubizhne: 11 Chekhova Street.

Authorities are urging people from Donetsk and Luhansk regions to evacuate immediately. After the start of a new offensive by the occupiers, it will be almost impossible to do it later, Minister of Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories, Iryna Vereshchuk, emphasizes.

The Kharkiv region is subject to partial evacuation, the Ministry of Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories clarified. Authorities in Kharkiv are advising residents of Lozova and Barvinkove ​​to evacuate.

The enemy plans to focus on eastern Ukraine, as the withdrawal of occupier troops from Kyiv and Chernihiv regions was by no means a ""gesture of goodwill"" before the next round of talks, as the russian authorities are trying to convey.

23:00 – During the day, almost 5,000 people were evacuated through humanitarian corridors, more than 1,200 of them from the Luhansk region, said Minister Vereshchuk.

Who's coming to Ukraine?

About financial aid, weapons, and volunteer fighters

Estonia handed over to Ukraine a batch of D-30 howitzers, ammunition for small arms, and bulletproof vests.

And the United States will allocate an additional $100 million for the purchase of anti-tank systems for Ukraine. This was announced by Secretary of State Blinken.

Thanks to concerts in different countries around the world, people managed to raise more than 83 million euros in support of Ukraine.

And the National Health Service of Great Britain will provide Ukraine with 20 ambulances. It is noted that the cars are not new, but will be able to replace cars destroyed as a result of hostilities in Ukraine. The first batch of ambulances will arrive in Lviv this week. From there, they will be sent to regions where hostilities continue.

The European Union does not want Ukraine to lose in the war and will therefore continue to arm it. This was stated by the head of the EU diplomatic corps Josep Borrell in a new statement on russia's invasion. At the same time, the representative of European diplomacy says that the European Union should avoid a direct conflict with russia.

In addition, German Chancellor Scholz said that Germany is sending all weapons from the Bundeswehr's reserves to Ukraine, which can be delivered quickly. What exactly this weapon is not yet disclosed.

20:30 – Biden said that today he signed a new package of defense assistance to Ukraine, which includes Javelin missiles.

News from partners

Candles are lit in Stockholm in memory of those killed in Ukraine.

Yesterday, the European Union's executive body launched a new disciplinary procedure against Hungary, which could freeze Prime Minister Viktor Orban's funding for undermining liberal democratic rights. It seems that Orban rubbed the wrong way not only Ukraine with his commitment to the ""russian world.""

The United States will ban Russia from using frozen foreign currency accounts in US banks to repay sovereign debt, as was previously possible, the White House said.

Turkey returns embassy staff to Kyiv after a temporary evacuation.

Pope Francis unfurls a Ukrainian flag sent from Bucha.

In Romania, a car crashed into the gates of the russian embassy. The incident took place in Bucharest. According to local media, after the collision the car caught fire, and the driver died at the scene. It is still unknown whether this is a coincidence or a planned action.

Europe is proposing to discuss asylum for russian soldiers who refuse to fight against Ukraine; European Council President Charles Michel reported on the intention to provide protection to those who do not want to kill.

After winning the election, Hungarian Prime Minister Orban reaffirmed Hungary's intention to pay for russian gas in rubles. ""If Russia asks to pay in rubles, we will pay in rubles,"" Orban said. Apparently, he sincerely believes that putin will never ask Hungary to ""denazify.""

Anonymous said they had gained access to the Kremlin's video surveillance system. ""Now we are inside the Kremlin,"" hackers say.

In Vilnius, the lake near the Russian embassy was painted in the color of blood. This is an artistic performance to draw the world's attention to the war crimes of Russia. The red color symbolizes the blood of murdered Ukrainians. Water-based paint is not harmful to animals and plants.

And the Prime Minister of Slovenia Janez Janša published a picture of how, in his opinion, the symbol of the Russian occupiers Z was born:

russia's war against Ukraine is entering a critical phase, and NATO allies are ready to provide Kyiv with all necessary assistance to counter the possible next invasion of the invaders. This was stated by NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg before the meeting of the North Atlantic Council at the level of foreign ministers.

The United States will not participate in G20 meetings attended by Russia, said US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.

Reaction to the atrocities of the russian army in Ukraine

Israeli Foreign Minister Jair Lapid has accused russians of war crimes. This is the first sharp comment from Israeli officials regarding the genocide in Bucha.

India has condemned the killings in Ukraine's Bucha and backed calls for an independent investigation.

moscow knew and deliberately conducted a campaign of atrocities in Bucha near Kyiv. This was emphasized by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken last night before leaving for a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels. ""What we saw in Bucha is not an accidental act of a criminal unit. This is a deliberate campaign: to kill, torture, rape, commit atrocities,"" Blinken said.

Ukraine already has a list of names of non-humans involved in atrocities in the Kyiv region, said Interior Minister Denys Monastyrskyi. During reconnaissance near one of the settlements of the former Borodianka district, the Ukrainian military found the headquarters of one of the battalion tactical groups (BTG) of the horde. Among the documents found is a book of staff records, a list of personnel, combat and numerical calculation, as well as a table of call signs.

What's in Russia?

russia, through its permanent representative to the UN, Vasily Nebenzyu, has admitted that it is waging a war in Ukraine, not a ""special operation."" Nebenzya used the word ""war"" instead of ""special operation"" at the UN press conference several times and admitted that the russian army was killing civilians.

And zakharova said that russian diplomats expelled from Western countries would be employed. Will everyone be accommodated in Eritrea?

Civilian personnel of the russian army is complaining about inflation, trade unions are threatening to sue. Today, the russian military-industrial complex is beginning to experience social unrest because of a sharp decline in wages and living standards. This is a logical consequence of the astronomical costs of the war and the inability to ensure stable budget revenues because of international sanctions and economic downturns, the Defense Intelligence said.

This morning, someone tried to set fire to Solovyov's villa on Lake Como (Italy) with the help of tires; unfortunately, firefighters arrived on time and managed to extinguish everything without damaging the villa.

Another drifting mine was found in the Black Sea off the island of Kefken off the coast of Turkey.

And some good news: zhirinovsky died again. This time it's final.

In russia, peskov explained the reason for the withdrawal of troops from the Kyiv region: ""The decision to withdraw russian troops from the Kyiv region was taken 'as a sign of goodwill to create favorable conditions for negotiations.'"" They really understood the main principle well: the more territories liberated, the more successful the negotiations.

It turned out that the Mir cards were issued on European chips. National Payment Card System companies no longer sell them to the card provider. There is nothing to replace imports with yet.

russia is threatening Finland with ""retaliatory measures"" if it joins NATO. ""Finland's accession to NATO would make it a target for Russian retaliation,"" said Vladimir Dzabarov, first deputy chairman of the International Committee of the Federation Council. Earlier, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that Finland and Sweden can count on NATO membership under the accelerated procedure.

What about Belarus?

Belarus is losing its human rights: Human Rights Watch has been blocked.

Like belarus, the russian occupiers can use the territory of unrecognized Transnistria to attack Ukraine. The airfield of Tiraspol is already being prepared for the reception of aircraft. In response to such assumptions, Moldovan President Maia Sandu said that the authorities had no information about the alleged preparation of Tiraspol airport for the reception of Russian aircraft, but such a risk can not be ruled out.

In belarus, three residents of Bobruisk were detained who, according to the authorities, were trying to prevent trains with russian equipment from moving towards Ukraine.

Two Belarusian citizens were detained in Poland. They are suspected of espionage for the benefit of the belarusian secret services, according to a statement from the Polish National Prosecutor's Office. Among other things, they collected data on military and civilian facilities that are crucial for Poland's defense.

Russian lies

Belgorod residents have started poisoning pigeons because of a television lie about Ukrainian biolabs. But there's really nothing funny here: it shows the depth of the disease of the society created by television.

The organizer of the russian rally in Berlin complains: ""Well, I did not know that there was such a tragedy, we would not go. My business is now destroyed. I get calls every minute from different countries with threats. My car service page was flooded with photos of corpses…."" Another one ""who knew nothing"" and was on the ""training.""

russian foreign ministry representative zakharova sings the usual verses on zombie television. According to zakharova, foreign media also became accomplices in the crimes in Bucha. In particular, America, which became an accomplice in ""this punitive action"" and ""spreading fakes,"" is to blame again. Nothing new. All around are enemies, as always.

Meanwhile, in the foreign exchange market, the official dollar exchange rate fell below 80 rubles. Moreover, on Aliexpress, it costs 146. The usual practice of a country with an ""iron curtain"" in the anamnesis. In the USSR, the dollar also had its own fictional ""exchange rate"" of 60 kopecks.

Sanctions on the aggressor!

American developer of electrical devices and components for computers Intel suspends all business operations in Russia. Earlier, the company suspended all deliveries to customers in russia and belarus.

The UK will freeze more than 60% of Russia's foreign exchange reserves. This will block Russia's access to $305 billion. This was announced by Foreign Minister Elizabeth Truss. Details of the government's decision are expected to be released this week.

Lithuanian product manufacturer Viciunu grupe will leave the russian market.

Following the Russian warship, Google sent a rosaviatsiya (russia's Federal Air Transport Agency) website.

The russian Finance Ministry said a foreign bank had refused to execute an order to pay coupon yields on russian bonds due on April 4. In fact, Russia now faces default.

According to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, Wopke Hoekstra, the country's customs arrested 14 russian yachts because of sanctions against russia. Twelve of them are only being built at shipyards, and two are under maintenance.

The United States is imposing full blocking sanctions against russia's Sberbank and Alfa-Bank. The United States is also banning new investments in the russian economy. It has been stated that the United States is trying to deprive russia of access to dollars so that it cannot service its foreign debt. The White House has said US sanctions could be tightened or eased depending on the situation.

The United States believes that sanctions will push back the russian economy by 15 years.

The United States is also imposing sanctions on putin's daughters and lavrov's wife and daughter, the White House said. Restrictions will also affect medvedev, mishustin and members of russia's Security Council.

Britain is also imposing new sanctions on russia. Among them is a ban on imports of russian iron and steel goods; a ban on new investments in russia, ban on exports to russia of oil refining equipment. The UK has also said it will stop importing russian coal by the end of 2022.

russian businessmen are trying to circumvent anti-russian sanctions; they are transferring business and capital to Turkey, which has not joined the sanctions against russia. For example, about 1,000 companies with 100% Russian capital have recently been opened in Turkey, said Izzet Ekmekcibashi, head of the Turkish-russian Business Council.

Trophies of the Ukrainian Armed Forces

The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine has allowed the territorial defense to use artillery and missile systems. This is stated in resolution №403. Previously, the Territorial Defense was allowed to use only small arms. Now our defenders will have many more battle trophies.

These days, soldiers of 81 separate airmobile brigades destroyed the electronic warfare unit of the Armed Forces of the russian federation. The EW unit was guarded by servicemen of one of the special-purpose brigades of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the russian Armed Forces.

Life considering hostilities

The Center to Counter Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine once again calls for securing gadgets.

Ukrainians have begun receiving messages to recover accounts from phones stolen by the russian military in an attempt to restore access to looted ""trophies.""

An interactive Map of Cultural Losses has been launched in Ukraine. Anyone can join in filling it out by sending photos or video evidence of the destruction of cultural objects as a result of the war. This was reported on the website of the author of the project, the Ukrainian Cultural Foundation. According to the fund's estimates, more than 150 monuments and sites were either damaged or completely destroyed as a result of the war against Ukraine waged by the occupiers.

The National Police of Ukraine has opened a ""hotline"" for relatives of those killed in the hostilities in russia. Number 0 894 201 867. This line operates around the clock. Operators are ready to provide the necessary advice and clarification on the burial procedure.

Currently, in the settlements liberated from russian troops, police are working around the clock to search for and identify the dead civilians. The bodies of the victims of russia's military aggression are being sent for forensic examination to determine the cause of death. After conducting the necessary research, the bodies of the dead are handed over to relatives for burial.

Paralympic champion Serhii Yemelianov has put up for auction his Gold Medal from Tokyo 2020. The funds raised will go to volunteers to help the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The auction ends tomorrow. You can take part in it at this link.

Kyiv and region

There is still a high probability that the enemy will launch missile strikes on elements of Kyiv's military and civilian infrastructure. The Head of the Kyiv city military administration Mykola Zhyrnov warned about it.

During the 35 days of russian occupation in Hostomel, Kyiv region, more than 400 people went missing.

In Borodianka, the occupiers bombed high-rise buildings and forbade getting people buried alive from under the rubble,"" the mayor said.

The mayor of Bucha, Anatolii Fedoruk, said that he had witnessed the execution of several people by russians. ""I myself saw several episodes. There were three civilian cars trying to evacuate towards Kyiv and they brutally shot them. There was a pregnant woman, her husband crying and begging not to shoot her, but they took and simply brutally shot them,"" the mayor reports.

russian General Vitalii Shkolenko, who ordered the shelling of Bucha and Irpin, turned out to be Ukrainian. He is a native of the Uman district of the Cherkasy region. He used to visit relatives from Bucha and Irpin many times. For such, hell must begin in life.

In Vorzel, the occupiers hung the heads of chickens on clothespins on clotheslines… The civilized world will never understand the purpose of such actions, but only one thing is clear, in the russian hinterland, where people who now destroy all life on our earth come from psychopathy is the norm. The russian army is implementing everything that only a sick human psyche can imagine.

Also Vorzel. These are corgi paws. There is a ladder behind the house. To which russian fascist villains nailed dogs with self-tapping screws and then flayed them here. And then ate! What they didn't eat, they put in a bag to warm the pieces up. What words to describe all the atrocities of the rabid horde?

""After Bucha, Irpin, Hostomel, we thought we were ready for anything. But Borodianka. This is the most horrible thing I've ever seen,"" said Oleksiy Kuleba, head of the Kyiv Regional Office. ""Rescuers from all over Ukraine are going to dismantle the blockages in Borodianka. The occupiers wiped the village from the face of the earth,"" Kuleba said.

Donetsk and Luhansk regions

One person died in Rubizhne last night. Five more were injured. This was announced by the head of the Luhansk Regional State Administration Serhii Haidai.

In addition, 11 residential buildings were destroyed in the region. Such are the consequences of yesterday's shelling by the russian army of the residential districts of Rubizhne, Lysychansk, Popasna, Severodonetsk, and Toshkivka. ""In the old part of Severodonetsk, garages caught fire; in Rubizhne, tanks with nitric acid are burning. Preliminary, without consequences. Three floors of the residential building in Popasna burned down at once. During the russian shelling, one Rubizhne resident died. 5 locals are wounded. Seven were taken out of the rubble alive,"" the statement said.

Heavy fighting and airstrikes by russian aircraft continue in besieged Mariupol. The humanitarian situation in the city is deteriorating. More than 160,000 people have no electricity, communications, access to medicine, heat, or water.

Former mayor of Rubizhne Serhii Hortov did not just side with the russian invaders; he passed on information about people with a pro-Ukrainian position to the occupiers. This was announced by the head of the Luhansk Regional State Administration Serhii Haidai. ""Apart from joining the occupiers, the mayor is also actively cooperating with them in identifying Ukrainian activists. He is simply betraying them. He is such a traitor who betrays people with a pro-Ukrainian position to the occupiers,"" the head of the region said.

At the same time, according to Haidai, Ukraine was able to ""slightly break the plans of the occupiers, who wanted to create a picture of how the mayor hands over the keys to the occupiers, and how they are welcomed."" He submitted a petition, and the president signed a decree establishing a military-civil administration in Rubizhne. This means that ""the mayor is now nobody,"" and even the russian occupiers no longer need this traitor.

Also today, the 503rd Marine Battalion refuted the statements of the russian media about the capture of personnel in Mariupol.

After the widespread international genocide in Bucha, Russia's top leadership ordered the destruction of any evidence of crimes committed by its army in Mariupol. The russians left all the dirty work to the collaborationists. Eyewitnesses report that the russians recruited local and DPR terrorists to special brigades. They collect and burn the bodies of Mariupol residents murdered and killed as a result of the russian invasion. The work of these groups is directly coordinated by the self-proclaimed mayor-collaborator Kostiantyn Ivashchenko.

12:30 – The head of the Donetsk Regional State Administration Pavlo Kyrylenko said that orcs fired at the city of Vuhledar from jet artillery. They hit the place of humanitarian aid. According to preliminary data, two civilians were killed and five were injured.

15:40 – the russian military fired on Severodonetsk, and ten high-rise buildings caught fire. The number of injured is being clarified, said the head of the Luhansk regional military administration Gaidai.

The invaders destroyed one of the buildings of the city hospital in Mariupol, burning almost 50 people alive. The mayor of the city Vadym Boichenko reported about it. He called on the West to tighten sanctions against Russia for all these atrocities. According to the mayor, according to preliminary estimates, 5,000 people died in Mariupol during the month of the blockade. About 210 of the dead are children.

In the past day alone, Mariupol has been bombed 118 times! This was announced by the Verkhovna Rada Commissioner for Human Rights Liudmyla Denisova.

20:30 – The Return Alive Foundation was able to deliver aid to Mariupol surrounded by russians! The fund's team managed to hand over thermal imagers, quadcopters, and power banks to the city's defenders. Despite the overly complex logistics, they promise to do it again and again!

21:30 – The number of victims due to the shelling of Vuhledar increased to 4 people.

Zaporizhzhia region

Five deputies from the OPZZh party in Mariupol were informants and fire adjustors of the occupiers. They helped the Russians quickly paralyze the city and create a humanitarian catastrophe, said the Mariupol City Council. Now the supporters of genocide in Mariupol are actively promoting the establishment of the occupation administration. All materials on collaborationists have already been submitted to the SBU.

In Vasylivka, Zaporizhzhia region, occupation forces looted a communal building housing the Department of Social Protection and the Service Center for Educational Institutions. They stole all computer equipment, including the one where databases with residents were stored. As a result of the russians' actions, it will be impossible to transfer pensions and other social benefits. Now local authorities have blocked the entrance to the premises so that the occupiers can no longer steal community property.

Kherson region

The Armed Forces of Ukraine liberated the villages and settlements of the Kherson region: Dobrianka, Novovoznesenske, and Trudoliubivka. The head of the Kryvyi Rih military administration Oleksandr Vilkul clarified that these settlements were in the most dangerous southern direction from Kryvyi Rih, and now there is the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

Fighting is currently underway near the village of Oleksandrivka.

""I would very much like Kherson to be released. We can't say all the information now, but yes, we have plans to release Kherson,"" Ukrainian Interior Ministry adviser Vadym Denysenko said in an all-Ukrainian telethon.

In the Novotroitske community, the russian military abducted Serhii Maksymenko, a deputy of the regional council and head of the Svitanok agricultural enterprise, the local newspaper Trudova Slava reported. According to locals, it happened three days ago. The deputy was taken away together with his son after searches. Nothing is currently known about their whereabouts.

Due to constant threats and ""suggestions"" for cooperation from the Russian military, Skadovsk Mayor Oleksandr Yakovlev left the city. He said he had to do so.

Russian military surrounded the village of Novooleksiivka, Henichesk district. There are searches in houses, grenade launchers were fired at a residential building. The number of victims is currently unknown. The publication Ukrainian South reported this with reference to the Crimean Tatar Resource Center.

It was very hot in the Vysokopillia United Territorial Community today. The day began at 5 am with loud and active explosions. Those who remained in Vysokopillia sat in basements and other safe places until about 12:00. Everyone wants liberation, nerves are already giving up, but we must hold on. People believe that victory is very close.

20:00 – The Armed Forces of Ukraine liberated another village in the Kherson region, Osokorivka! The General Staff reports.

Prior to that, the russian military abducted and took away in an unknown direction the head of the Osokorivka village Serhii Kunts, according to the FB group News Novovorontsovshchina.

Dnipropetrovsk region

Kryvyi Rih: if a driver is detained for driving under influence, their car will be handed over to the territorial defense. This order was announced by the head of the military administration of the city Oleksandr Vilkul.

On the night of April 6, the enemy attacked the Dnipropetrovsk region from the air and hit an oil depot and one of the plants. The oil depot with fuel was destroyed. Rescuers continue to put out the flames at the plant; there is a strong fire.

Vinnytsia region

In the Vinnytsia region, an infrastructure facility in Koziatyn was hit at night. The extent of the damage is being determined. No one was injured.

Zhytomyr region

More than 90 mines were found by specialized services on a separate section of the road of one of the forests of the Narodychi forestry. The State Agency of Forest Resources of Ukraine writes on the Facebook page about the beginning of demining of the northern territories of the Zhytomyr region liberated from russian troops. The equipment and the area near the administrative buildings need a thorough inspection. Citizens are asked not to visit the forest during martial law due to danger to life.

Chernihiv region

This is what the facilities of Chernihivvodokanal water supply company, which suffered as a result of shelling by the yussian military, look like. It is unknown when the centralized water supply will be restored in Chernihiv. ""Due to serious damage, neither the company nor even the city will be able to restore these facilities today without external assistance,"" Chernihivvodokanal reports.

Kharkiv region

Last night, the russian occupiers struck about 27 strikes from various weapons in residential areas of Kharkiv. ""The enemy wants to demoralize us and continues to strike chaotic blows at civilian infrastructure,"" said Oleh Sinehubov, head of the Kharkiv Regional State Administration.

Today, SES sappers have been demining all day in multi-story residential buildings, the private sector, and trade facilities in Mala Danylivka, Kulinychi, HTZ, and Pivnichna Saltivka districts.

Do not try to transfer them, eliminate them alone, etc. As soon as you see the ammunition, call 101,"" Sinegubov said.

Russian troops fired on Zolochiv from the temporarily captured Kozacha Lopan on the night of April 6, said community leader Viktor Kovalenko. According to him, a 33-year-old resident died.

Russia could end its ISS involvement in two years Roscosmos cosmonauts (from bottom left) Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov work outside the Nauka multipurpose laboratory module on the International Space Station during a spacewalk in January 2022. (Image credit: NASA) Russia could end its cooperation on the International Space Station in as little as two years, using the sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine as an excuse, according to space experts. Most commentators characterize the threats by the director general of Russia’s Roscosmos space agency to end its involvement with the orbital outpost as mere political bluster. But the threat to sever such relations could come to fruition, as some experts Live Science spoke to noted that Russia has only committed to the ISS project until 2024, rather than “after 2030” as had been proposed by NASA and other partners. And Russia’s withdrawal from the project could mean it will be mainly up to NASA to keep the ISS physically in orbit for almost another 10 years – something that Russia has been responsible for up until now. Even further, the threats signal just how badly Russia's actions in Ukraine have damaged ties in the scientific community between the country and the rest of the world, meaning that any science-related cooperation with Russia may be difficult, experts said.

Satellite tech uncovered evidence of a Russian massacre of Ukrainian civilians A WorldView-3 satellite image of grounds of the Church of St. Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints, on March 31. It appears to show a mass grave in its top center. (Image credit: Maxar Technologies) Satellite images have revealed what appears to be a mass grave and the bodies of civilians scattered in the streets of the Ukrainian town of Bucha. The images implicate Russian troops in a massacre. Many of the images were taken during the Russian occupation of Bucha by Maxar Technologies' WorldView-3 satellite. They show that the bodies — some of which were discovered by eyewitnesses with their hands bound and with gunshot wounds to the head — could have been in the streets for as long as three weeks. Another, taken on March 31, shows what is likely a mass grave on the grounds of a church, which includes a trench that is roughly 45 feet (14 meters) long, according to Maxar, a satellite company that produces ""90% of the foundational geospatial intelligence used by the U.S. Government for national security and keeping troops safe on the ground,"" as well as the imagery for companies such as Google Earth and Google Maps. A previous Maxar satellite image, taken on March 10, shows what looks like the initial excavations of the grave. Read the full story on Live Science .

Russians strike tank of nitric acid in Rubizhne 🛑 WARNING ❗In Rubizhne, #Luhansk region, Russian troops hit a tank with nitric acid!Nitric acid is very dangerous if inhaled, swallowed or if it is in contact with skin.The consequences of this incident are similar to usage of chemical or biological weapons!1/2 pic.twitter.com/o5kPccPg6uApril 5, 2022 See more A large tank of nitric acid was struck during a Russian air strike on the city of Rubizhne in eastern Ukraine, causing the ruptured tank to let loose a plume of yellow-brown smoke, The New York Times reported Tuesday (March 5). The colorless liquid turns brown upon exposure to water or oxygen, producing yellow or red fumes with an acrid odor, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Exposure to nitric acid can irritate the eyes, skin and mucous membranes and can also cause a condition known as ""wet lung,"" or pulmonary edema, where excess fluid accumulates in the organ. Exposure to the chemical can also irritate and inflame the lung tissue; cause bronchitis; and drive dental erosion. The ""highly corrosive"" acid is typically used in the manufacture of fertilizers, dyes and polymers, according to the CDC. After the Russian strike burst the nitric acid tank in Rubizhne, the governor, Serhiy Haidai, advised residents to stay indoors, close their doors and windows and wear masks to avoid inhaling the fumes, according to the Times. ""This is a rather toxic substance,"" Haidai said in a video posted on his Facebook page. ""We don't know where this toxic cloud will go.""

U.S. to give $250,000 to global chemical weapons watchdog The United States will allocate $250,000 to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), an intergovernmental organization, The Associated Press reported Tuesday (March 5). In a statement, Marc Shaw, deputy assistant secretary at the State Department’s Bureau of Arms Control, Verification and Compliance, said that he hopes that the money will enable the OPCW to ""quickly assist Ukraine as it seeks protection against chemical threats from the Russian government.""

Russia threatens to pull out of space station partnership (Image credit: NASA) Russia threatened to pull out of the International Space Station (ISS) program until sanctions from the West are lifted, according to news reports. This isn't the first time the Russian space agency, Roscosmos, has aired such threats. Head of Roscosmos Dmitry Rogozin said that Moscow would restore cooperation with ISS partners only after sanctions were lifted. (Other ISS partners include the United States, Japan, Canada and the European Union.) ""The purpose of the sanctions is to kill the Russian economy, plunge our people into despair and hunger and bring our country to its knees,"" Rogozin wrote on Twitter on Saturday (April 2), as translated from Russian using Google Translate. This and other similar tweets from Rogozin do not mean Russia will necessarily walk out on the ISS. The Russian space chief is known for his hyperbolic statements, according to Live Science sister site Space.com. Despite these past threats, the ISS has been operating normally, with NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei returning to Earth in a Russian Soyuz spacecraft on March 30.

Russian forces reportedly leaving the Chernobyl nuclear power plant (Image credit: Karen Kasmauski/Getty Images) The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, has been informed that the Russian forces occupying the Chernobyl nuclear power plant have ""in writing, transferred control"" of the defunct facility to Ukrainian personnel, The Associated Press reported . Three convoys of Russian forces have left the site and the rest seem to be preparing to leave, the IAEA reported Thursday (March 31). These reports came from Energoatom, Ukraine's nuclear power operator. In a Telegram post , Energoatom said that the Russian troops were leaving the Chernobyl power plant and surrounding exclusion zone and heading towards Belarus, according to a translation by Axios . Russian forces were also preparing to leave the nearby city of Slavutych, where many of the Ukrainian workers that monitor and maintain the plant live, the post said. In a later Telegram post , Energoatom said that the Russian troops signed a document officially confirming the plant's handover back to Ukrainian control. There have been reports of Russian soldiers being exposed to high doses of radiation while at the plant and in surrounding exclusion zone, but the IAEA has not yet been able to confirm those reports, according to the AP. The agency continues to investigate.

Biden announces ""largest release of oil reserves in history"" President Joe Biden has announced a plan to increase the U.S. oil supply, with the aim of driving down gas prices that have skyrocketed since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, according to a White House statement released March 31. Biden has called on Congress to institute fees for oil companies that have leased public lands and drilled wells for oil production but aren't actively utilizing those leased acres. In addition, ""the President will announce the largest release of oil reserves in history, putting one million additional barrels on the market per day on average — every day — for the next six months,"" the White House statement reads. The release will likely lower the price of oil in the short term, but it may not completely make up for the loss of Russian resources should the situation worsen, experts told The New York Times . Biden's two-part plan aims to increase oil supply, in the short term, and reduce the country's dependence on oil, in the long term, the White House statement notes. To achieve the latter goal, Biden's administration is pursuing various initiatives to increase the country's use of and investment in alternative energy sources.

Radioactive material stolen from Chernobyl monitoring lab (Image credit: Pavel Gospodinov via Getty Images) Sometime during Russia's invasion of Chernobyl in Ukraine, looters stole radioactive material from a radiation monitoring laboratory near the defunct nuclear power plant. There seems to be a low risk that this material would be used in so-called dirty bombs, an expert told Live Science. Read the full story on Live Science .

Ukrainian internet provider suffers major cyberattack Ukrtelecom, the biggest internet provider in Ukraine in terms of geographical coverage, was the target of a major cyberattack, the State Special Communications Service of Ukraine reported on Monday (March 28), according to The New York Times . During the attack, which the agency says was perpetrated by Russian forces, Ukrtelecom limited its service to private users and business clients in order to maintain coverage for the military, technical security and intelligence service of Ukraine. The company was able to restore connectivity to all users after several hours.

UN nuclear watchdog chief in Ukraine to discuss safety of facilities Rafael Mariano Grossi, the chief of the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, is currently in Ukraine to speak with senior government officials about maintaining the integrity of the country's nuclear facilities, CNN reported on Tuesday (March 29). The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has stated that it will offer ""urgent technical assistance to ensure the safety and security of the country's nuclear facilities and help avert the risk of an accident that could endanger people and the environment."" ""The IAEA's presence, where needed to ensure safety and security, is of paramount importance. We are ready to provide the necessary support now,"" Grossi said in an IAEA statement, according to CNN. Ukraine's nuclear sites include the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and 15 additional nuclear power reactors at four other plants.

Sanctions have caused Russians to panic-buy medicine Russian citizens are panic-buying medicines such as sleeping pills, contraceptives, cancer drugs, heart drugs, hormones and antidepressants following a further increase of Western sanctions and boycotts, Reuters has reported . Information from the Russian data analytics company DSM Group has shown that, in the two weeks between Feb. 28 and March 13, Russians bought one month's worth of pharmaceutical items. The 270.5 million items amount to a value of around $104 billion. Sergei Shulyak, general director of DSM Group, told Reuters that the surge was due to fear. ""The first fear was that everything could get more expensive and the second fear was that medicines they need won't be available in some time. Those fears moved people. They stood in lines at pharmacies and bought everything,"" he said. Shuylak explained that he expects the surge to stabilize over time, as many Russian manufacturers are still capable of producing generic drugs and foreign producers are still able to supply them, albeit at higher prices. He did raise concerns, however, that worsening relations with the West could leave Russian drug manufacturers unable to source some of the ingredients needed to make drug products.

Roman Abramovich and Ukrainian negotiators reportedly suffered from poisoning symptoms after peace talks Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, shown here at a Chelsea “football” match in 2017, experienced symptoms of poisoning after meeting with Russia in Kyiv. (Image credit: BEN STANSALL/AFP via Getty Images) The Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich and Ukrainian negotiators experienced symptoms of poisoning after a meeting to discuss peace with Russia in Kyiv earler this month, according to the Wall Street Journal . Abramovich and two members of the Ukrainian team reportedly suffered from red eyes, painful tears and peeling skin around their faces and hands after attending the meeting on the night of March 3-4, according to the investigative journalism group Bellingcat . The symptoms, which lasted until the morning, have been blamed on a likely biological or chemical weapons attack, with Bellingcat citing that the three affected men only consumed water and chocolate in the hours leading up to the onset of the symptoms. A fourth member of the team who also consumed the same chocolate and water did not suffer from symptoms. Bellingcat reports that , according to two chemical weapons experts and a doctor, the symptoms most closely matched those associated with porphyrin, organophosphates, or bicyclic substances, although a lack of specialized lab equipment near the victims made it impossible to know for sure. The experts believe that the dosage was low, indicating that the poisoner may have intended to scare the victims rather than kill them. It is unclear who was responsible for the alleged attack, but the Ukrainian negotiating team suspect it may have been committed by Russian hard-liners who hoped to disrupt peace talks between the two warring nations. Poisonings have an infamous place in modern Russian history and have occurred multiple times since the beginning of Vladimir Putin’s rule. These include the 2004 dioxin poisoning of Viktor Yushchenko (who ran against a Kremlin-favored candidate for Ukraine's presidency and was left disfigured); the 2004 poisoning of Russian investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya; the 2006 polonium -210 poisoning of former FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko and the 2018 Novichok poisoning of former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal.

US and EU strike landmark energy supply deal On Friday (March 25), U.S. President Joe Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the establishment of a joint task force to help reduce European dependence on Russian fossil fuels, according to a White House statement . The Task Force for Energy Security will be chaired by a representative from the White House and a representative of the President of the European Commission. Through this partnership, the U.S. will work with international partners to increase exports of liquified natural gas (LNG) to Europe; the plan does not specify how much of this LNG will be supplied by the U.S., specifically, according to Reuters . In the short-term, for the U.S. to increase its LNG exports to Europe, the nation would likely need to compensate by exporting less LNG to other places, analysts told Reuters. In addition to diversifying Europe's LNG supply, the task force will work to ""reduce overall gas demand by accelerating market deployment of clean energy measures,"" the White House statement reads. Speaking in Brussels after the deal was agreed on Friday, Biden said that launching the task force was not ""only the right thing to do from a moral standpoint"" but ""it's going to put us on a stronger strategic footing,"" The Guardian reported .

Russian forces destroy Chernobyl 'radioactive' lab Russian forces have destroyed a laboratory located in Chernobyl 's exclusion zone where radioactive samples were being stored, according to news outlets. The laboratory, which cost about 6 million euros to build, opened in 2015 and was aimed at improving the management of radioactive waste at the plant, among other objectives. The State Agency of Ukraine on Exclusion Zone Management reported on social media that the Russian military has now destroyed the facility and that radioactive material is in the ""hands of the enemy"" rather than the hands of a ""civilized world,"" The Hill reported . At the start of the invasion, Russian forces seized control of the power plant, holding hostage more than 60 workers who continued to try to maintain safety at the plant until volunteers could replace them, The Hill said. In addition, the automated radiation monitoring system in the exclusion zone has stopped working, according to National Nuclear Energy Generating Company of Ukraine (also called Energoatom), as reported by The Hill. Russian forces took control of Chernobyl early in the invasion on Feb. 24. After the defunct nuclear plant was seized, more than 60 workers continued to work for about 600 hours to maintain the facility until volunteers were able to replace them. Chernobyl is the site of the 1986 nuclear reactor meltdown, considered the world's worst nuclear disaster. The defunct plant and the contaminated zone surrounding the disaster, continue to be a a safety risk as Russian forces shell and bomb the area.

Ukraine using AI to identify deceased Russian soldiers Mykhailo Fedorov, the deputy prime minister and head of the Digital Transformation Ministry in Ukraine, has confirmed that Ukraine is using facial recognition technology to identify deceased Russian soldiers, Forbes reported . Specifically, they're using software provided by Clearview AI, the New York-based facial recognition provider, which has offered the service without charge, Fedorov's department told Forbes. Ukraine's aim in identifying Russian soldiers is to inform their loved ones of the deaths, and in doing so, ""dispel the myth of a 'special operation' in which there are 'no conscripts' and 'no one dies,'"" Fedorov wrote in a Telegram post, according to Forbes. In other words, the effort is intended to counter Russian propaganda and help reveal exactly how many Russian soldiers are dying in the ongoing war. Albert Fox Cahn, founder of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, told Forbes that using facial recognition technology of this kind in a war could be a ""human rights catastrophe in the making."" The technology is fallible, so it's possible that the deceased could sometimes be misidentified and the wrong loved ones informed of the death, he noted. He also expressed concern that the technology may eventually be used to screen refugees at checkpoints, where misidentification could have fatal consequences.

International agency 'gravely concerned' about safety of Ukraine nuclear reactors An international organization that promotes the peaceful use of nuclear energy is ""gravely concerned"" about Ukraine's nuclear reactors, which are at high risk of a severe accident due to the Russian invasion of the country, the related intense fighting and Russia's seizure of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. ""Over the past few weeks, the International Atomic Energy Agency has been actively working to ensure the safety and security of all nuclear installations in Ukraine during these dramatic and unique circumstances where major nuclear facilities are operating in an armed conflict zone,"" Rafael Mariano Grossi, IAEA director-general, said in a video statement Wednesday (March 23). ""I remain gravely concerned about the safety and security of nuclear facilities in Ukraine."" Several of Ukraine's 15 working nuclear reactors are currently under Russian control; Chernobyl has been occupied by the Russians since the start of the invasion on Feb. 24, according to The Guardian. ""The IAEA is ready and is able to deploy immediately and provide indispensable assistance for ensuring nuclear safety and security in Ukraine,"" Grossi said in the statement. In addition to the bombs and missiles that could endanger these facilities, fires have broken out in Chernobyl, officials have said. Firefighters are currently trying to extinguish wildfires near the Chernobyl Nuclear power Plant, the IAEA said in a statement Wednesday (March 23). ""The fire brigade from the town of Chornobyl [Chernobyl] has extinguished four fires, but there are still ongoing fires. The local fire station does not currently have access to the electricity grid,"" the regulator said, as reported by the IAEA. The nuclear power plant continues to rely on offsite power, the IAEA said. ""The distressing situation continues and the need to prevent a nuclear accident becomes more pressing with each day that passes,"" Grossi said, emphasizing the importance of allowing in IAEA experts to ensure nuclear reactor safety. ""This assistance is essential to help avert the real risk of a severe nuclear accident that could threaten public health and the environment in Ukraine and beyond,"" Grossi said.

Kremlin statement regarding Russia's nuclear weapons; EU considers joint measures to tackle energy crisis —Kremlin spokesperson Dmitri S. Peskov said that Russia would consider using nuclear weapons if the country comes under ""existential threat,"" CNN reported . Peskov said this in an interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour, after he repeatedly characterized Russia's invasion as a defensive move to protect Russia from Ukraine, which he said was ""formed by the Western countries, anti-Russia,"" according to The New York Times . — On Wednesday (March 23), the European Commission presented European Union (EU) leaders with options to handle soaring energy prices and impending fuel shortages largely driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, The New York Times reported . Some options include establishing price caps and subsidies, to lower energy prices for both consumers and businesses. Additional proposals suggest that, in advance of next winter, member states should jointly buy and store fuel so that resources can be rapidly stockpiled and then shared across the bloc.

Russia may soon resort to more severe tactics, Biden says U.S. President Joe Biden delivers remarks at the Business Roundtables CEO Quarterly Meeting in Washington, DC, on March 21, 2022. (Image credit: NICHOLAS KAMM / Contributor via Getty Images) Having recently launched its hypersonic missiles against Ukraine, Russia may soon resort to using more severe tactics, including biological and chemical weapons, President Joe Biden said in an address at the Business Roundtable’s CEO Quarterly Meeting on March 21. ""Now, Putin’s back is against the wall,"" Biden said. ""And the more his back is against the wall, the greater the severity of the tactics he may employ."" Russia has asserted — without evidence — that the U.S. and Ukraine have biological and chemical weapons, Biden noted. ""That’s a clear sign he [Putin] is considering using both of those. He’s already used chemical weapons in the past, and we should be careful … of what’s about to come."" In addition, Russia may soon execute cyberattacks against critical U.S. infrastructure, Biden said. ""The magnitude of Russia’s cyber capacity is fairly consequential, and it’s coming,"" he said. ""The federal government is doing its part to get ready.""

Chernobyl trees could release radiation if fired upon The trees around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant still hold loads of radiation absorbed during the 1986 nuclear meltdown, considered one of the world's worst nuclear disasters. Since Feb. 25, Russian forces have occupied the power plant and the surrounding exclusion zone , taking plant employees hostage. This seizure and related fighting put the forest at an increased risk of catching fire, according to William Keeton, a forest ecosystem scientist at the University of Vermont. Such a fire would release potentially dangerous radiation into the atmosphere. When the nuclear reactor ""melted down"" on April 26, 1986, it launched radionuclides across an area of about 58,000 square miles, according to Smithsonian Magazine . Some of that radiation washed down to the ground in rain, only to be taken up by growing trees. Those trees now store all of those radionuclides. ""These forests absorbed tremendous amounts of radiation during the 1986 disaster, and the trees and soils still contain significant radiation — in the form of large amounts of radioactive elements called radionuclides,"" Keeton said in a statement . If a forest fire happens — from a bomb, explosion or fire — this radiation could be released into the atmosphere. The forest there is mostly coniferous, which includes relatively fire-prone types of trees, Keeton said. Because of that risk, the U.S. Forest Service and Ukrainian experts have worked together to manage the fire risk. With Russian occupation, that capacity has dwindled. In addition, the forests are near the warzone, meaning risks from gunfire, explosions and even power line damage, Keeton explained. Forest fires in the exclusion zone are not unheard of. In April of 2020, about 50 acres (20 hectares) of forest caught fire near the abandoned village of Vladimirovka in Ukraine's exclusion zone, Live Science previously reported. Water drops from aircraft and a 124-person strong firefighting force were needed to put out that blaze.

Zoo near Kyiv requests safe passage to evacuate animals, procure food The Park XII Months zoo, located about 15.5 miles (25 kilometers) north of Kyiv in Ukraine, has requested that a humanitarian corridor be established to allow some of its animals to be evacuated, The Independent reported . For large animals that are difficult to transport, such as the rhinos and giraffes, the zoo staff hope that such corridors could serve as transport routes for food and fuel to heat the animals' enclosures. ""We need green corridors to bring in diesel, heat, and feed them. We can’t take out rhinos and giraffes, big animals, we don’t even have medicine to put them to sleep. We need to negotiate green corridors,"" Mykhailo Pinchuk, the zoo's owner, said in a recent Facebook video, according to The Independent. Since the start of the war, various humanitarian corridors have been established to allow tens of thousands of people to evacuate Ukraine, The Washington Post reported . However, these corridors have often been made impassable by ongoing Russian attacks, Ukrainian officials have said.

Countries must both prioritize clean energy and curb dependance on Russian oil, UN Secretary-General says António Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, speaks during the Global Climate Action High-level event: Racing For A Better World on November 11, 2021 in Glasgow, Scotland. (Image credit: Jeff J Mitchell / Staff via Getty Images) In response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, countries must not only decrease their reliance on Russian oil and gas but also heavily invest in renewable energy sources, António Guterres, the Secretary-General of the United Nations (UN), said in an address on Monday (March 21), The Guardian reported . It would be folly to invest in new fossil fuel infrastructure to make up for the loss of Russian resources, as doing so ""might create long-term fossil fuel dependence and close the window to 1.5C,"" the goal set forth at the Cop26 UN climate summit last year, he said. ""Countries could become so consumed by the immediate fossil fuel supply gap that they neglect or knee-cap policies to cut fossil fuel use."" Average global temperatures have already increased more than 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) since the pre-industrial era, The Washington Post reported . Estimates suggest that the world could pass the 2.7 F (1.5 C) cutoff by the 2030s, if critical action is not taken now. ""If we continue with more of the same, we can kiss 1.5 goodbye. Even 2 degrees may be out of reach,"" Guterres said Monday, according to the Post.

Leak at Ukraine ammonia plant sends residents into shelter An ammonia leak at a chemical factory near the northern Ukrainian town of Novoselytsya has led officials to urge residents to take shelter, all amidst the intense fighting with Russian armed forces in the area, according to news reports. The ammonia leak came from the Sumykhimprom fertilizer plant, the Sumy regional governor Dmytro Zhyvytsky said, as reported by Al Jazeera . Shelling from Russian forces caused the leak, he added, and wounded an employee at the plant. The Russian army has said otherwise, calling the ammonia leak a ""chemical false flag."" Russian army spokesperson Igor Konashenkov said, “The Russian army has not planned or delivered any strikes against Ukrainian facilities that manufacture or keep in store poisonous chemicals,"" Al Jazeera quoted him. Ammonia is a highly toxic gas made of nitrogen and hydrogen that produces a noxious odor. To produce the compound, plants utilize a chemical reaction of both elements at high temperature and pressure, according to the American Chemical Society . About 85% of the world's ammonia production is used directly or indirectly in agriculture, according to the ACS. The most common household use of the chemical is in glass cleaners. According to the ACS, exposure to the gas can cause severe skin burns and eye damage; it is toxic if inhaled and under pressure the gas can explode when heated.

Russia denies cosmonauts' suit colors showed Ukraine support The bright-yellow and blue flight suits donned by a trio of Russian cosmonauts as they boarded the International Space Station on Friday (March 18) appeared to be a sign of their support for Ukraine, whose flag is the same colors, some outsiders had said. Now, Russia has scoffed at that interpretation. The three cosmonauts, Oleg Artemyev, Denis Matveev and Sergey Korsakov, joined seven crewmates already onboard the ISS. On Saturday (March 19), the Russian space agency released a statement quoting Artemyev: ""There is no need to look for any hidden signs or symbols in our uniform. A colour is simply a colour. It is not in any way connected to Ukraine. Otherwise, we would have to recognise its rights to the yellow sun in the blue sky,"" Artemyev said, as reported by The Guardian . ""These days, even though we are in space, we are together with our president and our people!"" Even so, on Friday, Artemyev had explained the color choice with a different rationale, saying the team chose the bright yellow because there was so much of that material in storage, explaining ""that’s why we had to wear yellow,"" The Guardian reported.

Russia claims it used deadly hypersonic weapons Mikoyan MiG-31K fighter jets with Kinzhal hypersonic missiles fly over Moscow's Red Square during the Victory Day military parade in Moscow, Russia, on May 09, 2018. (Image credit: Sefa Karacan/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images) Russian president Vladimir Putin claimed the country has deployed its newest Kinzhal hypersonic missiles for the first time in Ukraine on Friday (March 18) in an effort to destroy a weapons storage facility, This is the first time that Russia has claimed to use such high-precision weapons in combat, according to the South China Morning Post. ""The Kinzhal aviation missile system with hypersonic aeroballistic missiles destroyed a large underground warehouse containing missiles and aviation ammunition in the village of Deliatyn in the Ivano-Frankivsk region,"" the Russian defence ministry said Saturday (March 19), as reported by Al Jazeera . The Kinzhal weapon, which was unveiled and tested in March 2018, reportedly travels at 10 times the speed of sound. At the time, Putin, speaking on Russian television, indicated that this new hypersonic missile and cruise missile had ""unlimited range"" and could avoid adversaries' detection technologies.

Russian cosmonauts wear Ukraine colors on space station Donning bright yellow and blue flight suits, cosmonauts Oleg Artemyev, Denis Matveev and Sergey Korsakov float aboard the International Space Station after arriving on March 18, 2022. (Image credit: Roscosmos TV) Three Russian cosmonauts who arrived at the International Space Station on Friday (March 18) wore yellow and blue flight suits — the same colors as the Ukraine flag — when they entered the orbiting lab, according to The Associated Press . The three cosmonauts, Oleg Artemyev, Denis Matveev and Sergey Korsakov, joined seven crewmates already onboard the ISS. Whether their ""fashion choice"" was a sign of their support for Ukraine during the Russian invasion is unknown. When the trio were able to speak with family on Earth, Artemyev was asked about the color choice. He responded: “It became our turn to pick a color. But in fact, we had accumulated a lot of yellow material so we needed to use it. So that’s why we had to wear yellow,” he said, as reported by the AP. Regardless, former NASA astronauts who were watching the docking with the ISS noticed. In a tweet on Friday, former NASA astronaut Scott Kelly said, ""Three Russian cosmonauts who just docked with the ISS arrive in Ukrainian yellow!"" Kelly was onboard the space station with cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko from March 2015 to March 2016.

International Energy Agency warns of impending energy crisis The International Energy Agency, an autonomous intergovernmental organization, warned that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is likely to create a global energy crisis, the likes of which we've never seen before, The New York Times reported . The agency, which was established after the 1973 oil crisis to help stabilize the global energy market, issued several recommendations to help nations reduce their dependence on oil. ""Reducing demand is a way of addressing the situation without just pumping more oil,"" said Fatih Birol, the agency’s executive director, according to the Times. The agency's recommendations include reducing speed limits; reducing fares on public transportation; promoting the use of trains over airplanes, when possible; encouraging carpooling; instituting car-free days in cities; and cutting down on commuting by having people work from home three days a week. The agency also put forth several recommendations to be implemented in the long-term, such as establishing the necessary infrastructure to prioritize electric vehicles.

Race to deliver food to Ukraine; ExoMars mission cuts ties with Russia The ExoMars rover, called Rosalind Franklin, is designed to collect samples beneath the Martian surface. (Image credit: ESA) —The World Food Programme (WFP) is urgently trying to deliver emergency food supplies to hardhit Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv, Kharkiv and Dnipro, The Guardian reported . These cities, the WFP said, are at risk of ""medieval tactics of besiegement."" “We are concentrating right now on stocking up the cities that are in danger of being encircled. That’s the rush against time for us,” said Jakob Kern, emergency coordinator for WFP, as reported by The Guardian. The agency will try to get food into the porty city of Mariupol, where bombings have destroyed a hospital complex and more, as well as the encircled city of Sumy; aid workers plan to take advantage of any ceasefires for humanitarian aid, The Guardian said. —The European Space Agency unanimously voted to suspend a joint Mars mission with Russia. The Council of the ESA said on Thursday (March 17) that due to the the tragedy that is unfolding in the Ukraine since the Russian invasion, the agency could no longer carry out ""ongoing cooperation with Roscosmos on the ExoMars rover mission with a launch in 2022,"" referring to the Russian Space Agency and its role in the second part of the ExoMars program that involves sending a rover and a Russian surface platform to the Red Planet.

Power lost at Chernobyl (again) The Chernobyl plant has been captured for nearly 3 weeks. (Image credit: Shutterstock) The defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant has lost power again, less than 24 hours after the plant's electricity was restored on March 13. Ukrenergo, Ukraine's electrical grid operator, has demanded safe entry to the site for a repair crew to inspect and fix the high-voltage power lines that supply the plant's electricity. Approximately 20,000 spent nuclear fuel units sit in the plant's cooling tanks, and without reliable power, the likelihood of the evaporation and discharge of nuclear material at the site may increase, Ukrainian officials have warned. But nuclear experts, including the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), have downplayed these concerns, saying that cutting off power to the Chernobyl power plant will not have a drastic impact on the facility's safety.

Pregnant woman from Mariupol hospital attack dies A pregnant woman who was pulled out of the rubble of the bombed Ukrainian maternity hospital in Mariupol on March 9 has reportedly died; her baby also died, The Associated Press reported. AP photos of the woman on a stretcher stroking her bloodied belly and her face in shock was one of the ""most brutal moments"" in the now 19-day invasion of Ukraine, the AP reported. When the woman was rushed to a nearby hospital, she reportedly realized her baby was dying and yelled out to the medics ""Kill me now!"" the AP said. The surgeon who treated her told the AP that her pelvis had been crushed and hip was detached from the attack. The baby was delivered via C-section, though it showed no signs of life.

Pharma company Bayer suspends ads, business in Russia Bayer, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, is halting business in Russia. ""As a response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Bayer stopped all spending in Russia and Belarus that is not related to supplying essential products in health and agriculture,"" Bayer said in a statement today (March 14). The ban includes halting both advertising and promotional activities in Russia as well as any capital investment projects. However, Bayer did not suspend delivery of their products to Russia, as some people had reportedly wanted: ""Our position is that this senseless war has already taken many lives. As a Life Science company, we have an ethical obligation — in every country we operate in. Withholding essential health and agriculture products from the civilian populations — like cancer or cardiovascular treatments, health products for pregnant women and children as well as seeds to grow food — would only multiply the war's ongoing toll on human life,"" Bayer said.

Energy prices soar in EU after Russian sanctions Energy prices skyrocket in the European Union, on the heels of sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, according to news reports. Nikolai Kobrinets, a Russian foreign ministry officer, said that the EU would pay at least three times more for their oil, gas and electricity, Reuters reported . ""I believe the European Union would not benefit from this — we have more durable supplies and stronger nerves,"" Kobrinets told Interfax, a Russian news agency, as reported by Reuters. In fact, Russia is currently urging India to invest even more into the country's oil and gas sector. ""Russia's economy faces its deepest crisis since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union , as the West imposes severe sanctions over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine,"" Reuters reported . Russia is one of the world's largest oil producers. This month, the International Energy Agency (IEA) put together a 10-point plan to help reduce the European Union’s reliance on Russia’s natural gas.

U.N. discusses baseless claims of U.S. bioweapons program in Ukraine, Russia adds 'bird army' to list of conspiracy theories A woman feeds pigeons in Ternopil, Ukraine. Russia claims the U.S. is training migratory birds to attack Russian targets with Ukrainian bioweapons. (Image credit: Getty) The U.N. Security Council convened on Friday (March 11) to discuss Russia's unsupported claims that the United States has been running a biological weapons program out of Ukraine. The U.S. again denied the claims, instead accusing Russia of using the council meeting for ""lying and spreading disinformation,"" the Associated Press reported . U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield suggested that Russia had fabricated these claims to ""justify its own violent attacks against the Ukrainian people,"" and that Russia was likely to ""use chemical or biological agents for assassinations, as part of a staged or false-flag incident, or to support tactical military operations."" U.N. disarmament chief Izumi Nakamitsu agreed that there was no evidence of ""any biological weapons programs"" in Ukraine. With its claims still being boosted by Chinese media as well as right-wing pundits in the U.S, Russia continued to push the story on Friday, adding the bizarre detail that the U.S. had trained an army of migratory birds to carry Ukrainian bioweapons across the border to drop on Russian targets, Vice reported .

WHO advises Ukraine labs to destroy high-threat pathogens A picture taken on May 8, 2021 shows a sign of the World Health Organization (WHO) at the entrance of their headquarters in Geneva (Image credit: FABRICE COFFRINI / Contributor via Getty Images) The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that Ukrainian public health labs that handle infectious agents destroy any ""high-threat pathogens"" to prevent potential spills during the ongoing Russian invasion, the agency told Reuters on Thursday (March 10). The WHO previously worked with Ukrainian public health labs to establish security protocols aimed at preventing the ""accidental or deliberate"" release of such pathogens, the agency told Reuters in an email. ""As part of this work, the WHO has strongly recommended to the Ministry of Health in Ukraine and other responsible bodies to destroy high-threat pathogens to prevent any potential spills,"" the email read. The agency also advised all affected parties ""to reach out for technical assistance as needed,"" regarding the safe and secure disposal of any pathogens. Read the full story on Live Science .

China boosts unsupported Russian claim of Ukraine bioweapons labs China has joined Russia in spreading unsupported claims that the United States has been funding biological weapons’ labs in Ukraine. The U.S. denies the claims, and the UN says it has not received any information to back them up. Even so, both China and Russia insist that the rumors are true, and that the U.S. may be gearing up to use them on Ukrainian citizens, the Associated Press reports . ""This Russian military operation has uncovered the secret of the U.S. labs in Ukraine, and this is not something that can be dealt with in a perfunctory manner,"" Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign ministry, said Thursday (March 10). ""It is not something they can muddle through by saying that China's statement and Russia's finding are disinformation, and are absurd and ridiculous."" The claims have since been picked up by far-right groups and media in the U.S., but U.S. state department officials say the allegations are a disinformation operation. ""The Russian accusations are absurd. They're laughable. And you know, in the words of my Irish Catholic grandfather, a bunch of malarkey. There's nothing to it. It's classic Russian propaganda,"" John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said in a news briefing on Wednesday (March 9). ""Unlike Russia, which does have chemical weapons and has used them, and does do biological weapons research and has for years, Ukraine has neither,"" Burns, the director of the CIA and a former U.S. ambassador to Moscow, said in a senate hearing on Thursday. ""And when you couple that with their demonstrated willingness to create false flag operations and try to create the impression that somehow Ukrainians are responsible for this, that should give us all pretty serious reason for concern about their propaganda."" The U.N. Security Council is set to discuss Moscow’s claim at a meeting today (March 11).

Chernobyl safe after power loss The damaged Chernobyl nuclear reactor, site of one of the worst nuclear accidents in history, in April, 1986 (Image credit: Karen Kasmauski/Getty Images) The UN's atomic watchdog has said that the cutting off of power to the Chernobyl power plant will not have a drastic impact on the facility's safety. The Chernobyl nuclear facility was taken on the first day of the invasion (Feb. 24). After heavy fighting, Russian forces captured the defunct plant and took its roughly 210 staff hostage. An announcement made yesterday (March 9) by Ukraine's state energy company said that the plant has been disconnected from the electrical grid, leaving its roughly 20,000 spent nuclear fuel units held in cooling tanks without active cooling, Live Science previously reported . This led to concerns that the defunct Chernobyl reactor's spent fuel would overheat and leak from containment. But the IAEA said in a tweet that while the development ""violates (a) key safety pillar,"" in this case it saw ""no critical impact on safety."" The UN agency said that ""the heat load of spent fuel storage pool and volume of cooling water at #Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant"" were ""sufficient for effective heat removal without need for electrical supply."" The seven pillars of nuclear safety are seven important regulatory conditions set out by the IAEA for nuclear facilities. Among them are the requirements to maintain the physical integrity of nuclear facilities; ensure that staff are not under coercion or duress; and guarantee a constant supply of electricity to facilities. Ukraine's state energy company has announced that ""there is no possibility to restore the lines"" at Chernobyl and that the site's security systems had also lost power. Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, a key Russian ally, has instructed Belarusian specialists to restore the Chernobyl plant's power supply, according to the state-owned Belarusian news agency BelTA.

A screenshot from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant's livestream during a fire following fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces (Image credit: Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine was overtaken by Russian forces last week, and now, the plant's communication lines have been cut, the United Nations' (UN) atomic watchdog has announced. That means that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is no longer receiving data transmissions from the Zaporizhzhia plant or the defunct Chernobyl power plant, whose communication lines had already been severed. Without a way to monitor how nuclear material is being handled at these sites, the IAEA cannot check that key safety regulations are being upheld or that material isn't being moved from its current location. ""The remote transmission of data from IAEA safeguards equipment located at nuclear sites around the world is an important component of our safeguards implementation, in Ukraine and globally,"" IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said in a statement . ""Such systems... enable us to monitor nuclear material and activities at these sites when our inspectors are not present."" Read the full story on Live Science .

'Genocide,' 'Apocalyptic' and 'Atrocity' used to describe situation in Mariupol Images being released from Ukraine continue to look bleak. Much of Mariupol’s population of 400,000 is without power, heat and water, as well as no phone signal, for over a week, a situation that the country’s foreign minister Dmitryo Kuleba said is akin to Russia ""holding 400,000 people hostage,"" The Guardian reported . The city is being bombarded by continuous shelling, resulting in the deaths of at least 1,170 Mariupol’s residents (47 of these individual were buried March 9 in a mass grave), the city’s deputy mayor Sergei Orlov said, as reported by The Guardian. Orlov called the acts ""medieval"" and ""pure genocide."" He reportedly added, ""The attack isn’t simply treacherous. It’s a war crime. They are attacking us with aviation, shells, multiple rocket launchers.” Meanwhile, the Red Cross has described conditions in Mariupol ""apocalyptic."" And ""catastrophic"" is the term the deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk used to describe what is happening in the port city, according to The Guardian. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy also denounced the brutal attack in Mariupol, saying it is an ""atrocity"" and comparing it to the devastation unleashed by the Nazis, The Guardian said.

Russia claims it used thermobaric weapons: What that means. A TOS-1A rocket system, shown in this stock image. (Image credit: SergeyVButorin/Getty Images) The Russian forces have used thermobaric weapons — which pull in oxygen to generate a super-hot explosion — in Ukraine, according to the U.K. Ministry of Defence. ""The Russian MoD has confirmed the use of the TOS-1A weapon system in Ukraine. The TOS-1A uses thermobaric rockets, creating incendiary and blast effects,"" the U.K. Ministry of Defence tweeted . The MoD also included a video showing the Russian TOS-1 rocket launchers, which can spit out up to 30 thermobaric warheads atop rockets in quick succession, according to the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation . Along with fuel air explosives, thermobaric warheads are a type of volumetric weapon that consists of a fuel container and two explosive charges, the Arms Control center explained. Once the weapon gets launched, the first explosive charge detonates and broadcasts fuel particles. Then, the second charge ignites those particles and oxygen in the surrounding air. The result? A high-pressure, high-temperature blast that can reverberate and can even generate a partial vacuum when released inside buildings and other enclosed spaces, the Arms Control center said. Though international law allows for the use of thermobaric weapons against military targets, they are banned if they could harm civilians, The Hill reported. U.S. officials have said that Russia is escalating its tactics, killing hundreds of civilians (including kids), The Hill reported . The Russian MoD has confirmed the use of the TOS-1A weapon system in Ukraine. The TOS-1A uses thermobaric rockets, creating incendiary and blast effects.Watch the video below for more information about this weapon and its devastating impact. 🇺🇦 #StandWithUkraine🇺🇦 pic.twitter.com/d8PLQ0PhQDMarch 9, 2022 See more

Children's hospital bombed in Ukrainian city Footage of the bombed-out hospital shows the interior and exterior in tatters. (Image credit: Volodymyr Zelenskyy via Twitter) A hospital complex that includes a children’s ward and maternity hospital in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol has been destroyed by Russian forces dropping bombs on the facility, CNN reports . Video of the building after being bombed shared by the city council of Mariupol shows a hospital in tatters, with scraps from walls and beds and equipment strewn or in piles across the floors. ""A maternity hospital in the city center, a children’s ward and department of internal medicine ... all these were destroyed during the Russian air strike on Mariupol. Just now,"" said Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the Donetsk regional administration. In terms of casualties, the police said that information “is being clarified,” CNN reported. Even so, preliminary information indicates that at least 17 people were injured in the Russian attack, according to CNN. Among those injured are staff and patients in the maternity ward, The New York Times said . Though Russia and Ukraine had agreed on a cease-fire on Saturday (March 5), hours later fighting had resumed. Videos of the current strike also show sprays of shrapnel bursting through hospital windows. One of the resulting craters, this one in a courtyard between buildings, looked to be about 10 feet (3 meters) deep, according to the Times. Read the full story on Live Science.

WHO provides health care aid to Ukraine and condemns Russian attacks on hospitals People receive medical attention in a hospital after an attack by Russian forces on March 8, 2022 in Kyiv, Ukraine. (Image credit: dia images / Contributor via Getty Images) Dr. Hans Henri P. Kluge, the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Director for Europe, issued a statement on March 8 addressing health care provisions for civilians within and refugees beyond Ukraine. Kluge notes that he's been working with Amin Awad, Assistant Secretary-General and United Nations Crisis Coordinator for Ukraine, to establish a system to safely convey humanitarian health supplies into Ukraine. ""So far, 2 shipments totalling 76 tonnes (36 + 40 tonnes) of trauma and emergency health supplies, as well as freezers, refrigerators, ice packs and cool boxes are in transit in Ukraine,"" the statement reads. ""We have further shipments of 500 oxygen concentrators and more supplies are on their way."" WHO teams have also been deployed to Hungary, Poland, the Republic of Moldova and Romania to assess the needs of incoming refugees and to help build up the capacity of local health care systems. As the Russian invasion continues in Ukraine, so too does the COVID-19 pandemic. ""Remarkably, Ukraine has maintained its COVID-19 surveillance and response system,"" the WHO statement reads. The country reported 731 COVID-19 deaths to the WHO last week, ""and sadly this number will increase as oxygen shortages continue."" In addition to addressing the health status of Ukrainians, the WHO condemned Russian attacks on health care facilities and workers in the country. ""It should not need saying that health workers, hospitals and other medical facilities must never be a target at any time, including during crises and conflicts. To date, we have 16 confirmed reports of attacks on health in Ukraine, and more are being verified. WHO strongly condemns these attacks on health-care services."" Read the full WHO statement .

Ukraine's top climate scientist calls this a ""fossil fuel war"" An oil refinery in Russia (Image credit: Anton Petrus via Getty Images) As Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, Svitlana Krakovska, a senior scientist at the Ukrainian Hydrometeorological Institute, and a delegation of other Ukrainian scientists continued to attend UN-run virtual meetings to finalize the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report . Krakovska, who headed the Ukrainian delegation, told the IPCC chair that the group would ""continue to work if we have an internet connection and no missiles over our heads,"" Bloomberg Green reported on Feb. 28. Soon, however, members of the delegation had to abandon the enterprise to seek safety in air raid shelters, or to flee Ukraine altogether, The Guardian reported on Wednesday (March 9). Krakovska sheltered in her home in Kyiv with her family as missiles struck nearby buildings. At this time, ""I started to think about the parallels between climate change and this war and it’s clear that the roots of both these threats to humanity are found in fossil fuels,"" Krakovska told The Guardian. ""Burning oil, gas and coal is causing warming and impacts we need to adapt to. And Russia sells these resources and uses the money to buy weapons,"" she said. ""Other countries are dependent upon these fossil fuels, they don’t make themselves free of them. This is a fossil fuel war. It’s clear we cannot continue to live this way, it will destroy our civilization."" This statement follows an executive order from President Joe Biden banning the importation of Russian oil, gas and coal into the U.S., as well as an announcement from the European Union that its member states will be drastically reducing their dependence on Russian fossil fuels.

Chernobyl nuclear plant just went dark (Image credit: Karen Kasmauski/Getty Images) The site of the worst nuclear disaster in history, Chernobyl’s nuclear power plant has gone dark, as Russian forces occupy the defunct plant in Ukraine. The plant along with the facilities in the Chernobyl exclusion zone have no electricity, Ukraine’s state energy company announced . With now power, the planet’s estimated 20,000 spent nuclear fuel units, which are stored in cooling tanks, will no longer receive cooling. The fear is that the spent nuclear fuel could discharge a dangerous dose of radioactivity to the plant’s personnel, Ukrainian officials warned. Even so, nuclear energy experts caution that because the fuel rods are 22 years old, they are not as hot as they were initially and so this discharge is unlikely. Facility staff are responsible for decommissioning the site and ensuring the safe disposal of the radioactive material inside the plant’s defunct reactors. However, since Russian forces seized Chernobyl, that work has been on hold. ""I'm deeply concerned about the difficult and stressful situation facing staff at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and the potential risks this entails for nuclear safety,"" IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said in the statement. ""I call on the forces in effective control of the site to urgently facilitate the safe rotation of personnel there."" Read the full story on Live Science.

Pentagon turns down Poland offer of Soviet-era fighter jets MiG-29 aircraft are twin-engine fighter jets designed in the Soviet Union. (Image credit: guvendemir/Getty Images) NATO member Poland said Tuesday (March 8) that the country was ready to deliver Mikoyan MiG-29 fighter jets designed in the Soviet Union to Ramstein Air Base for use by the U.S. The Defense Department, however, turned down the offer. The move is thought to be a way for Poland to avoid any retaliation for directly helping Ukraine fight against Russian invaders. However, the Pentagon responded that the delivering the Soviet-era warplanes from the Air Base in southwestern Germany into risky airspace is just not a ""tenable"" proposal. According to The Guardian , Poland is thought to have around 28 of these fighter aircraft. ""The prospect of fighter jets 'at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America' departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,"" John F. Kirby, Pentagon press secretary, said in a statement today . ""It is simply not clear to us that there is a substantive rationale for it. We will continue to consult with Poland and our other NATO allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland's proposal is a tenable one."" The proposal from Poland comes after news that although Russian forces are seeing great losses — and not the easy win the Kremlin had anticipated — the country under Vladimir Putin will push on, The New York Times reported . According to the Times, top intelligence officials said that Putin was ""surprised and unsettled by the problems that have hampered his military in Ukraine."" Even so, the Ukraine forces can't hold onto Kyiv forever. ""With supplies being cut off, it will become somewhat desperate in, I would say, 10 days to two weeks,"" Lt. Gen. Scott D. Berrier, the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told the Times.

Biden to sign order regulating cryptocurrency A novelty Bitcoin token arranged at a CoinUnited cryptocurrency exchange in Hong Kong, China, on Friday, March 4, 2022. (Image credit: Paul Yeung/Bloomberg via Getty Images) U.S. sanctions on Russia, including severe limits on the country's central bank, could deliver a crushing blow to the Kremlin and its ongoing invasion of Ukraine, according to news reports. And now, in order to prevent Russia from skirting these restrictions with cryptocurrency , U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to sign an executive order this week to regulate the digital currency. According to Reuters, Biden could sign the order on Wednesday (March 9) for ""a wide-ranging oversight of the cryptocurrency market."" The executive order is also a response to moves by China and others to create their own cryptocurrencies, Reuters reported . ""Although we have not seen widespread evasion of our sanctions using methods such as cryptocurrency, prompt reporting of suspicious activity contributes to our national security and our efforts to support Ukraine and its people,"" acting Director Him Das said, as reported by The Hill . Though Bitcoin is the most well-known cryptocurrency, thousands of these digital currencies exist and as of June 2021, about 220 million Americans used this completely virtual ""cash,"" according to Crypto.com . Those familiar with Biden's intentions say the executive order will task the State Department with ensuring that U.S. crypto laws align with those of allies, while mandating the the Financial Stability Oversight Council to investigate any related financial concerns and the Justice Department to look into the need for a new law to create a new currency, The Hill reported.",https://www.livescience.com/news/live/russia-ukraine-invasion-live-updates
