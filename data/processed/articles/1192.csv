WASHINGTON, March 4 (Reuters) - The U.S. Embassy in Ukraine said that attacking a nuclear power plant is a war crime, after Russia on Friday seized a Ukrainian nuclear facility that is the biggest in Europe.

The statement on the embassy's Twitter account went further than any U.S. characterization of Russia's actions in Ukraine since it launched its invasion on Feb. 24.

""It is a war crime to attack a nuclear power plant. Putin's shelling of Europe's largest nuclear plant takes his reign of terror one step further,"" U.S. Embassy Kyiv said in its post.

Russian invasion forces seized Europe's biggest nuclear power plant in heavy fighting in southeastern Ukraine, triggering global alarm, but a blaze in a training building was extinguished and officials said the facility was now safe.

Russia's defense ministry blamed a fire at the plant on a ""monstrous attack"" by Ukrainian saboteurs and said its forces were in control.

The State Department sent a message to all U.S. embassies in Europe telling them not to retweet the Kyiv Embassy's tweet calling the attack a war crime, according to CNN, which said it reviewed the message.

The State Department did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters asking if the Kyiv Embassy's tweet reflects the position of the entire U.S. government.

Rights groups have alleged violations of international war crimes law in Ukraine, including the targeting of civilians, as well as indiscriminate attacks on schools and hospitals.

On Wednesday, U.S. President Joe Biden stopped short of calling Russia's actions war crimes, saying, ""It's too early to say that.""

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby on Friday declined to answer the question, saying he would leave that determination to the International Criminal Court.

""This just underscores how reckless the Russian invasion has been and how indiscriminate their targeting seems to be. It just raises the level of potential catastrophe to a level that nobody wants to see,"" Kirby said in an interview with CNN.

""It is certainly not the behavior of a responsible nuclear power.""

Britain has publicly accused Russian President Vladimir Putin's government of war crimes.

The ICC, the world's top war crimes prosecutor, on the request of 39 member states, is investigating reports of cluster bombs and artillery strikes on Ukrainian cities. read more .

Karim Khan, a British lawyer named as the chief prosecutor of the ICC last year, said the crisis in Ukraine is a chance to demonstrate that those committing war crimes would be held to account.

Intentionally targeting civilians and civilian objects is a war crime, a U.S. State Department spokesperson told Reuters, adding that it is backing the investigation, particularly Khan's efforts to preserve evidence of possible atrocity crimes.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has strongly denied claims that Russian forces have struck civilian infrastructure targets or residential complexes.

The US Embassy in Kyiv has called Vladimir Putin's shelling of Europe's biggest nuclear power plant in Ukraine a 'war crime' that has taken his 'reign of terror' one step further, with staff being made to work at the gunpoint of Russian soldiers and President Volodymyr Zelensky warning a reactor blowing would be the 'end of Europe'.

Russian troops attacked the Zaporizhzhia plant in the early hours of Friday, with surveillance capturing a fierce gun battle between Putin's men and Ukrainian defenders that sparked a fire in a six-story training building just outside the main complex. Moscow's men then stopped firefighters getting to the building for several hours while Russian forces continued their relentless bombardment of cities across the country.

Moscow upped its strikes on cities in the north, with Kyiv, Chernihiv and Kharkiv all coming under fresh attack early Friday - as authorities in Chernihiv said civilian areas were hit with banned cluster munitions on Thursday, killing 47 people

The US Embassy in Ukraine released a statement on Friday condemning the attack on Zaporizhzhia and hinted it is further evidence the Russian leader should be investigated in the Hague. 'It is a war crime to attack a nuclear power plant. Putin's shelling of Europe's largest nuclear plant takes his reign of terror one step further,' Embassy staff wrote in a tweet.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Russia on Friday NATO will 'defend every inch' of its territory against a Russian attack as he condemned Moscow's attack on the nuclear plant as 'reckless'.

On Wednesday, President Biden said it was 'too early' to tell whether Putin had committed war crimes, but said it was clear he was targeting civilians. Both Democrat and Republican lawmakers have already called for Putin to face charges in the highest international criminal court.

There were also reports on Friday that the State Department was urging other diplomatic outposts not to share the Kyiv embassy's tweet.

Petro Kotin, the head of the state-owned nuclear power generator Energoatom, said on Telegram that Russian forces 'took control of the personnel and management of the nuclear power plant' and are now being made to work under the watch of armed Russian soldiers.

Putin ramped up his atrocities as the Biden administration stepped into the spiralling refugee crisis caused by the invasion by offering protected status to up to 30,000 Ukrainians living in or visiting the United States. The war is already said to have produced one million refugees in it's first week, and the number is set to skyrocket.

Homeland Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said: We condemn Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked attack against the Ukrainian people. Our hearts stand with the Ukrainian people, who are suffering so much tragedy and so much loss.'

Immigrations and Customs Enforcement have also suspended all deportation flights to Ukraine and seven other European during Russia's relentless campaign of violence.

President Zelensky said the attack on Zaporizhzhia could have caused a crisis equivalent to 'six Chernobyls' - referencing the fact that the modern-day plant has six reactors while the Soviet-era disaster affected only one - and called on Russians to end the fighting.

'There are 15 nuclear reactors in Ukraine. If one of them blows, that's the end for everyone,' he said on Friday 'That is the end for Europe...Immediate action must be taken to stop the Russian army...Stop this potential atomic catastrophe.'

Nuclear experts told the BBC that attacks on Zaporizhzhia were 'frightening' but that any disaster caused by fighting would be similar to Fukushima in 2011 rather than Chernobyl in 1986. Fukushima, in Japan, melted down after a tsunami cut electricity to the plant, disabling its cooling system. Chernobyl exploded after a training exercise gone-wrong caused an uncontrolled nuclear reaction.

Claire Corkhill, professor of nuclear materials at Sheffield University in the UK, told the corporation that the reactors at Zaporizhzhia now appear to be shutting down to remove the danger - which may have been Russia's intention in attacking the plant.

Russia's war against Ukraine is now entering its ninth day and shows no sign of stopping any time soon after talks between the two sides yesterday broke up without agreement, before Vladimir Putin went on TV to declare that he would keep battling for 'total victory' whilst spouting propaganda that Russia's forces are not deliberately targeting civilians and that the 'special operation' is proceeding on time with all of its major objectives completed to schedule.

Johnson has accused Russia of 'threatening the security of the whole of Europe' after Putin's troops attacked the continent's largest nuclear power plant overnight, sparking a fire that raged for hours before emergency crews were eventually allowed to extinguish it as Russian soldiers seized the complex.

Johnson condemned the attack as 'reckless' after a phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky who branded it 'nuclear terrorism'. Jens Stoltenberg, who is in Brussels today to meet with NATO allies, denounced attacks on all civilian infrastructure and said the fire at the plant underlined the need to end Putin's war as soon as possible.

Eventually, emergency crews were allowed to go in and douse the flames before Russian troops moved in an occupied the site, which provides a fifth of Ukraine's electricity. The UN's nuclear monitoring agency said that, fortunately, none of the site's six reactors had been directly damaged and radiation levels remained normal. Three Ukrainian troops were killed defending the complex, Kyiv said.

Moscow has, predictably, attempted to deny responsibility for the attack, saying its forces had come under attack by Ukrainian 'saboteurs' while patrolling the plant, who then set fire to the building themselves.

Ukraine is home to three other active nuclear power plants, one of which is located 70 miles from the city of Mykolaiv which Russian forces have begun attacking after seizing nearby Kherson. The other two active sites are located in the west and are not currently under threat, though that situation could change as the Russian attack branches out. Ukraine also has five sites which are out of action, including Chernobyl, but could still pose a risk if hit by shells.

Mykolaiv, a city to the west of Kherson which is now under Russian control, came under attack on Friday morning with the mayor saying troops had moved into the outskirts. Mykolaiv is located along the road to Odessa, Ukraine's third-largest city and main port, which is increasingly at risk of coming under siege.

The city of Mariupol, on the other side of the Crimean peninsula, also continues under heavy bombardment as Moscow's men try to bomb it into submission - with the aim seeming to be cutting off Ukrainian access to the Black Sea to deny the government access to lucrative trading routes.

Rafael Mariano Grossi, head of the UN's nuclear energy watchdog, outlines where the building that caught fire was in relation to the six reactors at Zaporizhzhia

Zaporizhzhia has six nuclear reactors, making it the largest of its kind in Europe, and accounts for about one quarter of Ukraine's power generation. One report said the fire was about 150 meters away from one of the reactors

Russia is continuing to advance in southern Ukraine, with Mariupol under bombardment and Odessa and Mykolaiv under threat. Chernihiv, in the north, and Kharkiv, in the east, continue to come under heavy bombardment. The capital Kyiv is also under threat, though Ukrainian counter-attacks took out some Russian forces early on Friday

President Zelensky has 'survived three assassination attempts in the past week' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has reportedly survived three assassination attempted in the last week. Mercenaries from the Kremlin-backed Wagner group and Chechen special forces were both allegedly sent to kill the Ukrainian president since Russia's invasion began last week. The assassins were foiled by subversive anti-war members within Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) - Russia's successor to the KGB - who alerted Ukraine officials, The Times reported. Ukraine Secretary of National Security and Defense confirmed the three assassination attempts and told local press that he had received information from the double agents 'who do not want to take part in this bloody war.' One of the groups that reportedly tried to kill Zelensky, 44, was the Wagner Group - which has 400 members located in Kyiv as members infiltrated Ukraine with a 24-name 'kill list.' If the attempt was success, Russian President Vladimir Putin would have been able to deny any involvement. 'They would be going in there with a very high-profile mission, something that the Russians would want to be deniable — a decapitation of a head of state is a huge mission,' a source told the Times. 'In terms of the impact on Russian sovereign policy, this would be perhaps their biggest mission so far. It would have a major impact on the war.' The army-for-hire, run by oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin - a close ally of the Russian president who is often dubbed 'Putin's chef' - was flown in five weeks ago and is being offered a huge sum for the mission. A few days ago, the highly-trained operatives were said to be waiting for the green light from the Kremlin to pounce, with their hit list also including Ukraine's prime minister, the entire cabinet, mayor of Kyiv Vitali Klitschko and his brother Wladimir - both boxing champions who have become iconic figures on the front lines of the capital. The plan was sabotaged after they reached the upper echelons of the Ukrainian government on Saturday morning, prompting Kyiv to declare a 36-hour 'hard' curfew, ordering everyone indoors so that soldiers could sweep the streets for Russian saboteurs.

Fighting is also continuing across the north and east, with Ukrainian special forces ambushing and destroying Russian tanks and armoured vehicles at Hostomel - to the west of the city - and Brovary - to the east - late yesterday and this morning. Ukraine also claimed its jets have targeted part of a 40-mile convoy currently stalled outside the city, amid fears it would encircle the capital and bombard it.

Meanwhile Chernihiv, to the north east of Kyiv, and Kharkiv, in Ukraine's east, were braced for more heavy shelling today after days of increasingly indiscriminate attacks including with banned cluster munitions have left dozens of civilians dead. Officials in Chernihiv said this morning that 47 people died in attacks yesterday.

President Putin is also stepping up actions on the home front, intended to head off internal dissent about the war as combat proves fiercer and harder than his generals anticipated, and western sanctions destroy large chunks of the economy.

Russia's rubber-stamp parliament on Friday approved new laws that would see anyone spreading 'fake news' about the invasion jailed for up to 15 years. Putin had previously threatened and shut down radio and TV stations referring to the 'war' or 'invasion' of Ukraine - which Moscow prefers to call a 'special military operation'.

Moscow also admitted to limiting news from outside sources getting into the country, with the BBC, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, independent Russian site Meduza and Germany's Deutsche Welle all restricted, while access to Facebook has been blocked.

Putin has also gone after peaceful protesters, with thousands arrested while marching in rallies around the country asking for the conflict to end.

Meanwhile diplomats from NATO, the EU and G7 will hold a series of back-to-back meetings today in order to discuss next steps in the crisis, with discussions expected to focus on reinforcing NATO's eastern flank in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, supporting non-NATO states such as Moldova and Georgia, and calls for more military support to be sent to Ukraine.

President Zelensky accused Russia on Friday of unleashing 'nuclear terror' after his forces attacked the plant, claiming the Russian leader wanted to repeat the Chernobyl disaster - considered the worst nuclear disaster in history.

'You know the word Chernobyl,' he said in a video posted on Friday morning, calling on Russia to stop its attack on a nuclear power plant 350 miles south of Kyiv.

'No country other than Russia has ever fired on nuclear power units.

'This is the first time in our history. In the history of mankind.

'The terrorist state now resorted to nuclear terror,' he said in the video message.

Zelensky said: 'Europe needs to wake up. The biggest nuclear power plant in Europe is on fire right now.

'Russian tanks are shooting at the nuclear blocks. These are tanks equipped with thermal imagers, so they know what they are aiming at.'

Meanwhile, Moscow's isolation deepened on Friday, with Airbnb becoming the latest company to pull out of the country - following Ikea, BP, Shell, HSBC, Apple and Nike.

'Airbnb is suspending all operations in Russia and Belarus,' tweeted the CEO, Brian Chesky.

Intel and Airbnb announced they were pausing business in Russia and Belarus on Thursday, joining a US tech freeze-out of Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.

The United States and European allies have imposed tough sanctions on Russia over the attack, with major corporations across a range of industries following suit by freezing business in the country.

Apple has halted all product sales in Russia and limited the use of Apple Pay, while Facebook, YouTube and Microsoft have moved to curb the reach of Russian state-linked news outlets.

'Intel condemns the invasion of Ukraine by Russia and we have suspended all shipments to customers in both Russia and Belarus,' the chipmaker said in a statement.

'Our thoughts are with everyone who has been impacted by this war.'

Airbnb's co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky, who has added a Ukrainian flag to his Twitter profile, tweeted that the company 'is suspending all operations in Russia and Belarus,' without giving further details.

The vacation-rentals platform also announced on Monday that it would offer free short-term stays for up to 100,000 people fleeing fighting in Ukraine.

Since the beginning of the Russian offensive, one million refugees have left the Eastern European country, the United Nations said Thursday.

Airbnb's offer echoes aid extended by the firm last August to people escaping Afghanistan after the Taliban took power.

The California-based company has also faced scrutiny over its presence in China in recent weeks.

Meanwhile NATO foreign ministers were meeting today to discuss their next steps over the war, with Canada's top diplomat Melanie Joly saying that 'all options' - including a no-fly zone over Ukraine - should be discussed.

President Zelensky has been calling for a zone to be established over Ukraine to stop Russian jets from bombing cities, but establishing such a zone would require NATO aircraft and anti-aircraft batteries intervening directly in the fighting in what Moscow is almost-certain to view as a declaration of war.

Joly stressed that she is not in favour of a no-fly zone and said NATO's top priority remains stopping the Ukraine war from spiralling into a world war, but added that 'we want to make sure scenarios are being discussed'.

The Prime Minister of Lithuania, whose country would be on the frontlines if fighting broke out between Russia and NATO, said demands for a no-fly zone are 'irresponsible.'

The shelling of the plant came as the Russian military pressed their attack on a crucial energy-producing Ukrainian city and gained ground in their bid to cut off the country from the sea.

As the invasion entered its second week, another round of talks between Russia and Ukraine yielded a tentative agreement to set up safe corridors to evacuate citizens and deliver humanitarian aid.

Leading nuclear authorities were worried - but not panicked - about the damage to the power station. The assault, however, led to phone calls between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and U.S. President Joe Biden and other world leaders. The U.S. Department of Energy activated its nuclear incident response team as a precaution.

Earlier, nuclear plant spokesman Andriy Tuz told Ukrainian television that shells fell directly on the facility and set fire to one of its six reactors. That reactor is under renovation and not operating, he said.

The Zaporizhzhia regional military administration said that measurements taken at 7 a.m. Friday (0500 GMT) showed radiation levels in the region 'remain unchanged and do not endanger the lives and health of the population.'

The mayor of Enerhodar, Dmytro Orlov, announced on his Telegram channel Friday morning that 'the fire at the (nuclear plant) has indeed been extinguished.' His office told The Associated Press that the information came from firefighters who were allowed onto the site overnight.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council in 'coming hours' to raise the issue of Russia's attack on the nuclear power plant, according to a statement from his office.

Zelensky said Russia's attack on the power plant amounted to 'nuclear terror' that threatened all of Europe

U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm tweeted that the Zaporizhzhia plant's reactors were protected by robust containment structures and were being safely shut down.

In an emotional speech in the middle of the night, Zelenskyy said he feared an explosion that would be 'the end for everyone. The end for Europe. The evacuation of Europe.'

'Only urgent action by Europe can stop the Russian troops,' he said. 'Do not allow the death of Europe from a catastrophe at a nuclear power station.'

But most experts saw nothing to indicate an impending disaster.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said the fire had not affected essential equipment and that Ukraine's nuclear regulator reported no change in radiation levels. The American Nuclear Society concurred, saying that the latest radiation levels remained within natural background levels.

'The real threat to Ukrainian lives continues to be the violent invasion and bombing of their country,' the group said in a statement.

Orlov, the mayor of Enerhodar, said Russian shelling stopped a few hours before dawn, and residents of the city of more than 50,000 who had stayed in shelters overnight could return home. The city awoke with no heat, however, because the shelling damaged the city's heating main, he said.

Prior to the shelling, the Ukrainian state atomic energy company reported that a Russian military column was heading toward the nuclear plant. Loud shots and rocket fire were heard late Thursday.

Later, a livestreamed security camera linked from the homepage of the Zaporizhzhia plant showed what appeared to be armored vehicles rolling into the facility's parking lot and shining spotlights on the building where the camera was mounted.

Then there were what appeared to be muzzle flashes from vehicles, followed by nearly simultaneous explosions in surrounding buildings. Smoke rose into the frame and drifted away.

Vladimir Putin's forces have brought their superior firepower to bear over the past few days, launching hundreds of missiles and artillery attacks on cities and other sites around the country and making significant gains in the south.

The Russians announced the capture of the southern city of Kherson, a vital Black Sea port of 280,000, and local Ukrainian officials confirmed the takeover of the government headquarters there, making it the first major city to fall since the invasion began a week ago.

A Russian airstrike on Thursday destroyed the power plant in Okhtyrka, leaving the city without heat or electricity, the head of the region said on Telegram. In the first days of the war, Russian troops attacked a military base in the city, located between Kharkiv and Kyiv, and officials said more than 70 Ukrainian soldiers were killed.

'We are trying to figure out how to get people out of the city urgently because in a day the apartment buildings will turn into a cold stone trap without water, light or electricity,' Dmytro Zhyvytskyy said.

Heavy fighting continued on the outskirts of another strategic port, Mariupol, on the Azov Sea. The battles have knocked out the city's electricity, heat and water systems, as well as most phone service, officials said. Food deliveries to the city were also cut.

Associated Press video from the port city showed the assault lighting up the darkening sky above deserted streets and medical teams treating civilians, including a 16-year-old boy inside a clinic who could not be saved. The child was playing soccer when he was wounded in the shelling, according to his father, who cradled the boy's head on the gurney and cried.

Severing Ukraine's access to the Black and Azov seas would deal a crippling blow to its economy and allow Russia to build a land corridor to Crimea, seized by Moscow in 2014.

Overall, the outnumbered, outgunned Ukrainians have put up stiff resistance, staving off the swift victory that Russia appeared to have expected. But a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Russia's seizure of Crimea gave it a logistical advantage in that part of the country, with shorter supply lines that smoothed the offensive there.

Ukrainian leaders called on the people to defend their homeland by cutting down trees, erecting barricades in the cities and attacking enemy columns from the rear. In recent days, authorities have issued weapons to civilians and taught them how to make Molotov cocktails.

'Total resistance. ... This is our Ukrainian trump card, and this is what we can do best in the world,' Oleksiy Arestovich, an aide to Zelenskyy, said in a video message, recalling guerrilla actions in Nazi-occupied Ukraine during World War II.

The second round of talks between Ukrainian and Russian delegations was held in neighboring Belarus. But the two sides appeared far apart going into the meeting, and Putin warned Ukraine that it must quickly accept the Kremlin's demand for its 'demilitarization' and declare itself neutral, renouncing its bid to join NATO.

Putin told French President Emmanuel Macron he was determined to press on with his attack 'until the end,' according to Macron's office.

The two sides said that they tentatively agreed to allow cease-fires in areas designated safe corridors, and that they would seek to work out the necessary details quickly. A Zelenskyy adviser also said a third round of talks will be held early next week.

Despite a profusion of evidence of civilian casualties and destruction of property by the Russian military, Putin decried what he called an 'anti-Russian disinformation campaign' and insisted that Moscow uses 'only precision weapons to exclusively destroy military infrastructure.'

Putin claimed that the Russian military had already offered safe corridors for civilians to flee, but he asserted without evidence that Ukrainian 'neo-Nazis' were preventing people from leaving and were using them as human shields.

The Pentagon set up a direct communication link to Russia's Ministry of Defense earlier this week to avoid the possibility of a miscalculation sparking conflict between Moscow and Washington, according to a U.S. defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the link had not been announced.

On Wednesday Ukrainian civilians built makeshift roadblocks with bright orange lorries and piles of tyres on the main route to the Zaporizhzhia site.

Brandishing Ukrainian flags, the army of volunteers created a human barricade near the city of Enerhodar to stop advancing Russian troops.

Footage posted on social media showed the blockade, reportedly a kilometre long and comprising scrap cars, garbage trucks and sandbags.

Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior ministry, warned on Wednesday the Russians could create a 'new Chernobyl' if the plant was damaged.

'Because of Vladimir Putin's madness, Europe is again on the brink of a nuclear catastrophe,' he wrote on Facebook.

'The city where the largest nuclear power plant in Europe is located is preparing for a battle with the invaders. An accident can happen like at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant or the Fukushima nuclear power plant.

'Russian generals – think again! Radiation does not know nationalities, does not spare anyone!'

Russia has written to the International Atomic Energy Agency saying its forces have taken control of the area around the plant.

The UN nuclear watchdog said Moscow claimed technicians at Zaporizhzhia were continuing their 'work on providing nuclear safety and monitoring radiation in normal mode of operation'.

The letter on Wednesday added: 'The radiation levels remain normal.'

IAEA chief Rafael Grossi warned on Wednesday that any 'accident involving the nuclear facilities in Ukraine could have severe consequences for public health and the environment'.

He said it was 'imperative to ensure that the brave people who operate, regulate, inspect and assess the nuclear facilities in Ukraine can continue to do their indispensable jobs safely, unimpeded and without undue pressure'.

Jan Vande Putte, co-author of the risk analysis, said: 'So long as this war continues the military threat to Ukraine's nuclear plants will remain.

'This is one further reason, amongst so many, why Putin needs to immediately cease his war on Ukraine.'

The fight to protect Zaporizhzhia is symbolic of the everyday heroism shown by the Ukrainian people.

Vitali Klitschko, the mayor of Kyiv, told the BBC he had seen a line 'hours long' of civilians queuing up to get weapons.

'Right now, people are proud,' the former world champion boxer said.

His brother Wladimir, who was also a top fighter, said: 'This is our home. Our parents are buried here, our children go to school here.

'Why should we flee? What would you do if someone gets in to your house? You defend it.'

The message is an indication that the US government may not be endorsing the war crime allegation made by the embassy.

“All – do not/not retweet Embassy Kyiv’s tweet on shelling of the facility being a possible war crime,” the message said. “If you have retweeted it – un-retweet it ASAP.”

As Russian forces continue their onslaught on key Ukrainian cities, the country's biggest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhia, came under attack Friday. A blaze there initially sparked fears of a potential accident, but the fire has since extinguished. The International Atomic Energy Agency also said the reactors at the plant are safe and no radioactive material was released.

Thus far, the administration of US President Joe Biden has not said that any of Russia’s aggressions in Ukraine amount to war crimes. President Biden said they are following Russia’s actions closely when asked about the matter on Wednesday.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken has given brief remarks multiple times today in Brussels, but he has not mentioned the attack on the Ukrainian nuclear power plant.

The US has no reason to doubt Russian claims that they are in control of the nuclear power plant, a senior defense official said on Friday. But the official also said that it is ""deeply concerning"" that US doesn't know what Russian control looks like, expertise of people there and their near-term intentions.

On the night of March 3, more than 4 million people watched a livestream of security camera footage from the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. Located along the southern bank of the Dnieper River, the six reactors at Zaporizhzhia constitute the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Bright flashes illuminated columns of armored vehicles, which were otherwise muted against the grayscale footage.

Before the invasion, Ukraine derived nearly half its electrical power from nuclear power plants, and of that, nearly half the capacity comes from Zaporizhzhia. With the reactor held by Russian forces and cities like Mariupol under siege from Russian forces, Zaporizhzhia’s capture stands as both a first in the history of warfare, and as part of a much longer pattern: the denial of electrical power to countries under invasion.

During the attack, a projectile hit a training building on the power plant campus, setting it on fire. The reactors remained unharmed and the fire was later extinguished. By the morning of March 4, the site was reportedly under Russian control, with a Ukrainian authority claiming the management of the facility was operating under gunpoint.

In the early hours of March 4, the plant “became the first operating civil nuclear power plant to come under armed attack,” the World Nuclear Association declared in a statement, going on to note that “The Additional Protocol of 1979 to the Geneva Conventions contains in Article 56 a provision stating that nuclear power plants ‘shall not be made the object of attack, even where these objects are military objectives, if such an attack may cause the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population.’”

When it fell, Zaporizhzhia became the second nuclear power plant captured by Russia since the invasion began. A week earlier, on Feb. 24, Russian forces had captured Chernobyl (“Chornobyl,” in Ukrainian), the long since decommissioned site of the infamous nuclear reactor disaster. Chernobyl last produced electricity in the year 2000, but the site is still staffed to manage the work of decommissioning, like sustaining cooling pools for spent fuel rods.

“Regarding reports earlier today of higher radiation measurements at the Chornobyl site,” the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a February 25 release, “Ukraine’s regulatory authority said that they may have been caused by heavy military vehicles stirring up soil still contaminated from the 1986 accident.”

The same geographic concerns that situated Chernobyl along the Pripyat River north of Kyiv also suggests why so many tanks and military vehicles had driven by: It’s a relatively cleared, dry area along a highway north of the capital, a traversable break from the surrounding marshlands. Kyiv remains a pivotal objective of Russian forces in the war, and the road through Chernobyl is one of the most direct paths for forces aiming to encircle the city.

Even decommissioned, important work continues at Chernobyl, like the safe monitoring of cooling pools for spent fuel. A loss of power to the site, reported by Ukraine’s minister of foreign affairs Dmytro Kuleba, could threaten its operation, though the cooling pools should maintain an effective temperature for weeks or months, depending on the estimate. The IAEA noted that the lack of power is also a strain on the staff and guards working in captivity at the facility.

But Zaporizhzhia, a live reactor complex located between Russia’s Crimean holdings and its advancing forces from the declared Donetsk and Luhansk republics, presents a much more striking security challenge than the inactive Chernobyl. Managing the safety of a nuclear power plant requires technical skill and the ability to properly and thoroughly follow safety procedures. Doing so under hostile military occupation, while that same military is responsible for attacks on the country, might make such safety procedures impossible, and difficult to verify.

“According to reports, the situation at occupied power plants is bad and getting worse. Plant managers need to get approval for any actions, including those related to reactor operations,” writes Nickolas Roth of the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a U.S.-based nonprofit aimed at reducing nuclear and biological threats. “Ukraine’s nuclear regulator has said it is now having problems communicating with staff at Zaporizhzhya as phone lines, emails, and fax machines are no longer operating.”

Only one of the reactors at Zaporizhzhia was operational at the time of the attack, thanks to regular maintenance outages, controlled shutdowns, and reserve operation. Reactors are designed to withstand many kinds of powerful impacts, like storms and even airliner crashes, so it remains unlikely that an errant shell from a battle would be catastrophic.

Instead, a deeper concern from the hostile occupation of Zaporizhzhia is that merely being held in Russian hands will lead to denying electricity to civilians in the country. Invading militaries have destroyed or captured power plants before, but never one like this. It’s a grim signal, as Russia’s invasion moves from first forays to grinding sieges.

Gravelines Nuclear Power Plant, France

The Gravelines Nuclear Power Plant, which has an installed net capacity of 5,460MW and a gross capacity of 5,706MW, currently ranks as the sixth largest nuclear power facility in the world.

The power station is located at Gravelines in Northern France and consists of six similar capacity PWR units commissioned between 1980 and 1985.

The nuclear power facility, owned and operated by the French electric utility company Electricite De France (EDF), created a benchmark in August 2010 by delivering its 1,000 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity.

Paluel Nuclear Power Plant, France

The Paluel Nuclear Power Plant, located 40km away from Dieppe, France, is currently the seventh largest NPP in the world, by net capacity. The plant is spread across 160ha on the waterfront of the English Channel and uses water from the Channel for the cooling.

The plant is owned and operated by EDF and consists of four PWRs with a gross installed capacity of 5,528MW (1,382MW each) and net design capacity of 5,200MW (1,300MW each).

Construction of the nuclear power station began in 1977. The first two units of the plant were connected to grid in 1984. The third and fourth units were commissioned in 1985. Paluel is the second largest French NPP, after Gravelines.

Cattenom Nuclear Power Plant, France

The 5,448MW (gross) Cattenom Nuclear Power Plant is located in Cattenom, France. The power plant is owned and operated by EDF. The net capacity of the plant is 5,200MW, which is similar to that of Paluel NPP, the seventh largest nuclear power plant in the world.

Cattenom Nuclear Power Plant consists of four PWRs rated at 1,362MW each. Construction of the plant started in 1979 and commercial operations began in April 1987. The fourth reactor of the plant was connected to grid in 1991.

The Cattenom nuclear facility uses water from the Moselle River. Three condensers of the plant were removed and retubed in 2019, which involved the replacement of a total of 64,200 tubes.

Yangjiang Nuclear Power Plant, China

The Yangjiang nuclear power plant, located in the Guangdong province, China, has a gross installed capacity of 5,430MW encompassed by five 1086MW PWRs while the sixth reactor is scheduled to be commissioned in the second half of 2019.

Owned by China Guangdong Nuclear Power Company (CGNPC) and operated by the Yangjiang Nuclear Power Company, the current net capacity of the power station is 5,000MW, which makes it the eighth biggest nuclear power plant in the world.

The first three units of the plant were commissioned in 2014, 2015 and 2016, while the fourth and fifth units were connected to the grid in January 2017 and the fifth in May 2018, respectively.

Shin Kori Nuclear Power Plant, South Korea

The Shin Kori nuclear power plant, located near Ulsan, South Korea, has an installed net capacity of 4,748MW and a gross capacity of 4,974MW. It is the third biggest nuclear power plant in South Korea and the world’s ninth-biggest by net capacity.

Owned and operated by Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP), the power station is installed with four operational PWR units, including two advanced power reactor-1400s (APR-1400). Two more APR-1400 units have been under construction at the site since April 2017 and September 2018, respectively.

The first two units of 996MW net capacity each were commissioned between 2010 and 2012, while the third and fourth units were brought online in January 2016 and April 2019, respectively.

The Hongyanhe nuclear power plant located in Donggang, near the coastal city of Dalian, Liaoning province, consists of four operational PWR units of with a gross installed capacity of 4,476MW (1,119MW each) and net design capacity of 4,244MW (1,061MW each).

Hongyanhe currently ranks as the second biggest nuclear power facility in China and the tenth biggest in the world. Two more 1,000MW PWR units currently under construction at the site are scheduled to come online in late 2019 and 2021, respectively.

The Hongyanhe plant is owned and operated by Liaoning Hongyanhe Nuclear Power (LHNP), which is a joint venture of CGNPC (45%), China Power Investment Corporation (CPIC, 45%), and Dalian Construction Investment Group (10%). The four CPR-1000 reactor units at the plant were commissioned between 2013 and 2016.

Fukushima Daini Nuclear Power Plant, Japan

The Fukushima Daini or Fukushima II nuclear power plant located in Naraha, Fukushima Prefecture, Japan, would have ranked as the tenth biggest nuclear power plant in the world if operational. The four reactor units of the Fukushima II were automatically shut down due to the Great East Japan Earthquake in March 2011.

The 4,268MW (net) plant is owned and operated by TEPCO. It consists of four BWR units with a gross capacity of 1,100MW and a net capacity of 1,067MW each.

The powerful tsunami waves triggered by the 9.0 magnitude undersea earthquake caused meltdowns at three reactors in the Fukushima Daiichi NPP while Fukushima Daini survived the disaster because of the emergency shutdown of its reactors. All four reactors of Fukushima Daini have since been maintained in cold shutdown. In June 2018, TEPCO informed that it was considering the decommissioning of the plant.

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

Blasts lit up the night sky as the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, about 400 miles southeast of Kyiv, came under shell fire.

Ukrainian firefighters said they were prevented from accessing the site initially, before the attack was paused and they were able to douse a blaze at a training facility on the site.

The six reactors at Zaporizhzhia, which can power enough energy for four million homes, were apparently undamaged and international monitors reported no spike in radiation.

But the attack was slammed in Western capitals as utterly irresponsible.

""We survived a night that could have stopped the story, the history of Ukraine, the history of Europe,"" Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky said.

An explosion at Zaporizhzhia would have equalled ""six Chernobyls,"" he said, referring to the plant in Ukraine that was the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986.

""Russian tank commanders knew what they were firing at,"" Zelensky alleged, adding: ""The terrorist state now resorted to nuclear terror.""

After phoning Zelensky during the night, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson demanded an urgent meeting of the U.N. Security Council.

He accused Putin of ""reckless actions"" that ""could now directly threaten the safety of all of Europe"" and pressed anew for a ceasefire.

Putin, however, has been unrepentant about an offensive that has cast Russia into the economic, sporting and cultural equivalent of exile to Siberia.

He said Thursday that the invasion was going ""strictly according to schedule, according to plan"" in its aims of driving out the ""neo-Nazis"" in Kyiv led by Zelensky — who is Jewish.

The Kremlin denied its forces had shelled the plant, instead blaming the fire on Ukrainian ""saboteurs"" and calling it a ""monstrous provocation,"" according to the Reuters news service.

But Western leaders added their voices to Johnson's, strongly condemning the shelling.

Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store described the shelling as ""madness"" and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi called it ""heinous"" and said it was ""an attack on everyone's security.""

""This just demonstrates the recklessness of this war and the importance of ending it and the importance of Russia withdrawing all its troops and engaging good faith in diplomatic efforts,"" NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said

The head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog offered Friday to travel to Chernobyl to negotiate with Ukraine and Russia and ensure the security of Ukraine's nuclear sites.

""I have indicated to both the Russian Federation and Ukraine my availability ... to travel to Chernobyl as soon as possible,"" Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, told reporters.

""Both sides are considering"" the possibility, he added.

Russia last week seized the site of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, which left hundreds dead and spread radioactive contamination west across Europe.

The rule would require the state to up its zero-emission car sales in the coming years, culminating in the full ban. It comes in response to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s executive order to end the sale of gas-powered cars by 2035, which he issued last September.

Román Partida-López, legal counsel for transportation equity at the non-profit Greenlining Institute, said he expects the rule to pass in a form fairly close to where it is currently, given that CARB has already been in talks with both the advocacy community and the auto industry. “There’s probably some buy-in from both,” he told Protocol.

Car companies have historically had a bit of a tenuous relationship with California regulators, which have imposed more stringent air pollution standards than federal ones. (A number of states have adopted California's standards as well.) Since the Trump administration, though, they have mostly fallen in line. For instance, they gave up on a high-profile lawsuit over California’s ability to set its own emissions in February 2021. California is such a large market for vehicles that not only do its policies inform what kinds of cars are sold nationwide, they also tend to be echoed by federal policy.

The proposal wouldn't apply to sales of used vehicles, which is how most people in the U.S. buy their cars). It also wouldn't require cutting gas-power vehicle sales cold turkey on Jan. 1, 2035. Starting with the 2026 model year, 35% share of new cars, SUVs and small pickup trucks sold in California must be zero-emission. After that, the required share would ratchet up yearly. Of the total, 20% can be plug-in hybrids.

Partida-López said that while the rule is a step in the right direction — and could “set the standard of what electric vehicles could look like post-2026,” when the current, less ambitious clean cars rule sunsets — it does not go far enough in terms of delivering on the state’s environmental justice goals.

“Currently, the rule itself just addresses the status quo approach,” Partida-López said, in reference to the number of automakers that have already committed to selling only zero-emissions vehicles by 2035 or thereabouts. “It’s building on the commitments that automakers have already made, and not necessarily being transformative or pushing them to do better.”

The rule in its current form would likely result in one major boon for low-income communities: In expanding the number of EVs on the market, it will inevitably expand the used EV market as well, which has remained relatively thin even as the number of them on the market has swelled in recent years. But Partida-López would like to see more intentionality, saying the rule could include formal requirements that automakers work to increase accessibility and deployment of EVs in low-income communities, including access to charging networks and other avenues. There's extra urgency to do that given that those same communities often face disproportionate impacts from air pollution from gas-powered cars zipping down roads and over highways nearby.

These issues could also factor into people's livelihoods. Ride-hailing companies, for instance, have said they want to transition to EVs in the coming decades. But infrastructure as well as the cost of EVs have so far created barriers to actually getting drivers in zero-emission cars.

An alliance of automobile manufacturers expressed qualified support in the wake of the proposal, saying that they are committed to electrifying the transportation sector. They also expressed concerns, however, about whether the right pieces are in place to meet the rule’s timeline. The lack of charging infrastructure and competition for critical minerals could make the transition a little rocky. Partida-López acknowledged this is a potential challenge as well, but argued that aligning regulations with the automakers plans will incentivize the state to address these issues sooner than later.",https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/ukraine-russia-nuclear-plan

The statement on the embassy's Twitter account went further than any U.S. characterization of Russia's actions in Ukraine since it launched its invasion on Feb. 24.

""It is a war crime to attack a nuclear power plant. Putin's shelling of Europe's largest nuclear plant takes his reign of terror one step further,"" U.S. Embassy Kyiv said in its post.

Russian invasion forces seized Europe's biggest nuclear power plant on Friday in heavy fighting in southeastern Ukraine, triggering global alarm, but a huge blaze in a training building has been extinguished and officials said the facility was now safe.

Russia's defense ministry blamed a fire at the plant on a ""monstrous attack"" by Ukrainian saboteurs and said its forces were in control.

Rights groups have alleged violations of international war crimes law in Ukraine, including the targeting of civilians, as well as indiscriminate attacks on schools and hospitals.

On Wednesday, U.S. President Joe Biden stopped short of calling Russia's actions war crimes, saying, ""It's too early to say that.""

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby on Friday declined to answer the question, saying he would leave that determination to the International Criminal Court.

""This just underscores how reckless the Russian invasion has been and how indiscriminate their targeting seems to be. It just raises the level of potential catastrophe to a level that nobody wants to see,"" Kirby said in an interview with CNN.

""It is certainly not the behavior of a responsible nuclear power.""",https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-embassy-in-ukraine-calls-nuclear-power-plant-attack-by-russians-a-war-crime-101646403917898.html
