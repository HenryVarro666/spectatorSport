Many military analysts and policymakers have thought about this contingency with the Russian invasion going very badly. Russia, after all, has the most nuclear warheads in the world.

Tactical Nuclear Strikes

Normally, a military would use a tactical nuclear strike to break a battlefield stalemate—existing or potential—and tip the scale in its favor.

A tactical nuclear weapon can destroy even the best prepared defensive line at a moment’s notice. Although tactical nuclear weapons have less power than the atomic bombs the U.S. dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, they still pack an explosive power of approximately 5,000 tons of TNT.

Normally, a military would use a tactical nuclear strike to break a battlefield stalemate and tip the scale.

For example, during the Cold War, the Fulda Gap between West and East Germany offered ideal ground for armored warfare. In the event of a war between the U.S. and NATO, the Soviet Union was planning on pouring its tank and mechanized infantry formations through the Fulda Gap to attack Western Europe.

Recognizing the threat, the U.S. had placed seven brigades to guard the 31-mile gap. Even if the Soviets sent masses of tanks and mechanized infantry, the NATO forces could delay them long enough to allow for reinforcements to arrive or to prepare other defensive positions in the rear.

But a tactical nuclear strike would obliterate the NATO forces guarding the gap and allow the Warsaw Pact divisions to pass. Further, since the strike would be tactical in nature, NATO would be less likely to respond with a strategic nuclear attack, which would cause a nuclear war and the mutual destruction of both warring parties.

In a sense, tactical nuclear weapons are intended to let a country have its cake and eat it too.

A Nuclear Attack to Break the Save Face?

Early into the war, Russian President Vladimir Putin put his nuclear forces on high alert in response to the military aid the U.S., NATO, and the European Union sent Ukraine and the unprecedented wave of sanctions that the U.S. and its allies unleashed. The move also had a domestic flavor, as Putin wanted to appear tough and capable to the Russian people and balance his miscalculation in Ukraine.

“So, on the nuclear question. . . what I would tell you is we’ve seen Mr. Putin’s announcement. We believe it’s as unnecessary as it is escalatory. But we’re reviewing and analyzing that announcement,” Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby had said after Putin raised Russia’s nuclear posture.

The U.S. saw through Putin’s motives and didn’t raise its strategic deterrence posture.

“And I would only just tell you that as we continue to review and analyze and monitor that Secretary Austin is comfortable with the strategic deterrent posture of the United States and our ability to defend the homeland, our allies, and our partners,” the Pentagon spokesperson added.

“We believe that this is not only an unnecessary step for him to take but an escalatory one, unnecessary because Russia has not ever been under threat by the west or by NATO and certainly wasn’t under any threat by Ukraine. And escalatory because it is clearly potentially putting at play forces that could that if there’s a miscalculation could make things much, much more dangerous,” a senior Pentagon official had said.

But that doesn’t mean that the Russian leader might not resort to a tactical nuclear strike to save face.

More than a month has passed since the first Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine and the Russian military has failed to achieve any of its primary objectives. The war is going so bad for Moscow that the Russian military has changed its goals, relinquishing the capture of Kyiv and focusing on eastern Ukraine and the Donbas. Should the Russian military fails to make any considerable gains in its publicly stated goals in the Donbas, Putin and his advisers would have nothing to fall back onto.

But a tactical nuclear strike—most likely justified with some sort of outlandish excuse, including a false flag operation—would give Putin a way out.

Russian Nuclear Capabilities

When it comes to nuclear weapons, the Russian military is the most powerful in the world. Moscow has approximately 6,400 nuclear warheads. In comparison, the U.S. military can field 5,800 nuclear warheads.

The Russian nuclear arsenal is managed by the Strategic Rocket Forces, a distinct branch of the Russian military that controls the country’s nuclear triad—the ground, naval, and air components.

On the ground, the Russian military has about 310intercontinental ballistic missiles that can carry up to 1,189 nuclear warheads.

In the sea, the Russian nuclear deterrence is focused on about ten Delta- and Borei-class submarines, with each packing 16 submarine-launched ballistic missiles that have several warheads each. In total, the Russian nuclear maritime force can launch about 624 nuclear warheads.

Finally, in the air, the Russia’s Aerospace Force has between 50 and 70 strategic bombers—Tu-160 Blackjack and Tu-95MS Bear—that each can carry from 12 to 16 AS-15 cruise missiles armed with nuclear warheads.

1,3fffbb4e-40ff-4dbb-bcf6-3d5d9590444b,['Mike Eckel'],,"Three days after launching the biggest invasion of another European nation since World War II, President Vladimir Putin put the world on further notice: In a televised meeting, he ordered Russia’s nuclear forces on “special combat readiness.”

In case anyone didn’t get the first message, Dmitry Kisleyov, a bombastic host on state-run TV, hammered it home hours later: ""Now Russia's entire nuclear triad has been placed on special alert. Putin has warned [the world]. Don't try to frighten Russia.”

Western officials took heed – though privately they said they were less concerned with words than with actions. By the fourth week after the invasion, U.S. officials said there was no indication anything had changed for Russia’s silo-launched, submarine-launched, truck-launched, or air-launched nuclear weapons.

Still, threat or bluster, Putin’s nuclear saber-rattling in the middle of a hot war in Europe has renewed focus on how Russia plans for the “unthinkable” -- the use of the world’s largest nuclear arsenal -- and how the nuclear policies of other countries, chiefly the United States, might play into that.

“Few if any wars have been launched with as much nuclear posturing as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” said Olga Oliker, director of the Europe and Central Asia Program at the International Crisis Group, in an article published by the journal Foreign Affairs days after Putin’s announcement.

“I think the bottom line is that Russia's doctrine allows nuclear use in case of existential threat to the state,” she said in a follow-up message to RFE/RL. “Regime change is probably an existential threat to the state. But how useful nuclear weapons are for that isn't entirely clear. But there's a real danger there.”

“Putin’s threat is unprecedented in the post-Cold War era -- and unacceptable,” Daryl Kimball, head of the Washington-based Arms Control Association, said in a statement a day after Putin’s televised order. “There has been no instance in which a U.S. or a Russian leader has raised the alert level of their nuclear forces in the middle of a crisis in order to try to coerce the other side's behavior.”

Existential Danger

In 2020, Russia’s military planners released a new strategic document that offered more clarity on when Moscow could use nuclear weapons and what could justify it.

The document, titled Foundations Of State Policy Of The Russian Federation In The Field Of Nuclear Deterrence, stated that the use of nuclear weapons was an option only as a retaliatory measure against the use of nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction -- or if “the very existence of the state is in jeopardy.”

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov reiterated that guideline in comments to CNN on March 22. Refusing to rule out the use of nuclear weapons, he emphasized that Russian policy allows it in the case of an “an existential threat for our country.”

On one level, that is highly unlikely: Moscow is on the offensive in Ukraine, after all, and neither Kyiv nor NATO is threatening any attack on Russia, let alone one so devastating.

For many analysts, though, a problem arises if the Kremlin and military commanders equate the existence of the Russian state with Putin’s rule.

And in Putin’s Russia -- where the parliament speaker has said there is no Russia without Putin, and senior officials offhandedly accuse the West of plotting the country’s demise -- that’s not so far-fetched.

On March 23, Dmitry Medvedev, the longtime Putin ally, former president, and current deputy head of Russia’s Security Council, suggested that escalating tensions could result in a nuclear disaster and alleged that Washington had engaged in a long-term plot to destroy Russia.

“The logic here is simple: if change of government is forced from the outside, the state is no longer sovereign,” said Nikolai Sokov, a senior fellow at the Vienna Center for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation and former Soviet and Russian diplomat who participated in major arms control negotiations.

“Which is why I believe that the most risky period will be after the fighting ends and the West will have to decide on what to do with Russia. If it goes too far -- the Iraq scenario -- then I do not rule out nuclear use,” he said.

“In the end, nuclear use does not have to be limited to military contingencies. It is possible to defeat a state by using nonmilitary tools, so (1) nuclear use is possible in peacetime and (2) policy should be very carefully calibrated,” he said in an e-mail.

Nuclear Doctrines

In 2018, President Donald Trump’s administration released a doctrine paper that spelled out both U.S. and Russian thinking about nuclear weapons use.

“Russian strategy and doctrine emphasize the potential coercive and military uses of nuclear weapons,” the paper said. Moscow “mistakenly assesses that the threat of nuclear escalation or actual first use of nuclear weapons would serve to ‘de-escalate’ a conflict on terms favorable to Russia. These mistaken perceptions increase the prospect for dangerous miscalculation and escalation.”

Where Ukraine is concerned, said one prominent Russian expert on nuclear issues, the conflict remains “strictly local.” That is, beyond supplying weapons and intelligence, NATO and the United States have gone out of their way to stay out.

They “are taking necessary measures to keep it that way, and Russia, although with rather explicit nuclear signaling, acknowledges that,” said the expert, who asked to speak anonymously due to growing concerns about government pressure on independent analysts and media.

Moreover, Russia hasn’t unleashed its full conventional arsenal: “The footage of Mariupol or Volnovakha is extremely depressing, but it gives a hint of what is possible, and on a much bigger scale.”

“Thus, there are no conditions for nuclear use,” he said.

A Russian nuclear strike would mean “we arrive to the uncharted waters of nuclear warfighting. And a nuclear war can never be won,” he said.

New START, Old START

Until the Russian invasion, arms control was one of a dwindling number of areas where United States and Russia could still talk to each other.

Even as relations spiraled downwards -- over Crimea, election meddling, Syria, the Kremlin’s poisoning of dissidents, and other issues -- Moscow and Washington maintained caps on their nuclear arsenals.

The Trump administration pulled out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. But Trump did not pull out of New START, the sole remaining agreement limiting U.S. and Russian nuclear forces.

Trump’s successor, President Joe Biden, made it his administration’s first priority to agree with Russia to extend the treaty for five years, and the former Cold War foes did so just days after he took office in 2021.

For many Western experts, the Kremlin’s willingness to extend New START was an indication that Moscow was rational -- and pragmatic -- about its nuclear arsenal.

But that treaty does not include tactical, or nonstrategic, nuclear weapons -- less powerful arms that are designed not for flinging at distant cities atop long-distance missiles, but for local battlefield use. U.S. intelligence estimates Russia has more than 1,500 of them.

According to a Congressional Research Service report released this month, the United States has far fewer, around 230 in total. About 100 of those are deployed in Europe – mainly gravity bombs that are designed to be dropped from jets -- something Moscow has complained about for years.

“Russian statements, when combined with military exercises that seemed to simulate the use of nuclear weapons against NATO members, led many to believe that Russia might threaten to use its nonstrategic nuclear weapons to coerce or intimidate its neighbors,” the CRS report said.

For the moment, fears of instability or confusion within the Kremlin or in the strategic command structure that oversees operations of Russia’s nuclear weapons have been nonexistent, according to Western officials, who say the command-and-control procedures and chain of authority overseeing launch decisions is robust and competent and professional.

In recent days, U.S. and British officials have suggested publicly and privately that Putin was being misled by his closest advisers -- both about Russia’s capabilities in the run-up to the war and about ongoing operations.

This makes it even more unlikely that nuclear weapons would be used, said Kimberly Marten, an expert on Russian foreign and security policy at Barnard College, Columbia University, in New York.

It “implies that there is a screen of presumably rational officers, who don’t themselves want to experience nuclear war, who are serving as a filter between whatever emotional reactions Putin might have, and the battlefield,” she told RFE/RL in an e-mail.

""I wouldn’t go so far as to say that nuclear use isn’t going to happen, though,"" she said. ""I remain concerned about a miscalculation or error that comes about through an inadvertent confrontation and escalation between Russian and NATO forces in a border area, for example.""

The other calculation for the Kremlin, experts say, is whether limited use of a nuclear weapon or chemical weapons in Ukraine would result in exactly what it has adamantly warned against: NATO intervention in the conflict, prompted, for example, by a radioactive fallout drifting into alliance member states.

“I think Russia would use nuclear weapons to keep the war from becoming existential for it, and any war with NATO is existential,” Oliker said. “So there's a real risk if NATO states get directly involved.”",https://www.rferl.org/a/russa-nuclear-weapons-ukraine-analysis/31782510.html

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

Russia’s war on Ukraine has brought renewed attention to tactical nuclear weapons, with the White House announcing on March 24 that it had a team of experts briefing NATO on contingency plans in case any such weapon is used.

This story also appeared in Popular Science

As a defensive alliance, NATO has formally stayed out of the war, though many member countries have sent military supplies to Ukraine, from tiny Luxembourg to the United States.

According to a March 23 New York Times report, this contingency planning included options for what might happen if Russia used a “small” tactical nuclear bomb. These shorter range weapons, often with small yields, are known as tactical nuclear weapons. Developed early in the Cold War and still in existence now, these weapons persist as part of the broader nuclear arsenals of the U.S. and Russia.

On March 28, Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for the Kremlin, told PBS that “no one is thinking about using, about even the idea of using a nuclear weapon.”

But the war offers a good moment to take a look at just what a tactical nuclear weapon is, and how they differ from the kinds of warheads that are in ICBMs. From the dawn of the Cold War in the 1940s through the 1980s, both the U.S. and the Soviet Union invested tremendous amounts of time, energy and resources strategizing around nuclear weapons with the expectation that they would be used in a war over Europe. This led first the United States, and then the USSR, to develop and field nuclear weapons for the battlefield.

No nation has detonated a nuclear weapon in war since the U.S. did so twice over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, killing as many as 210,000 people. That destructive power, carried compactly in the bays of just two bomber planes, had no special taboo against its use until President Harry Truman made the decision for the Army to stop using it.

Ukraine in crisis This story is one in a 10-part series on nuclear risk, military technology and the future of warfare in light of Russia’s February invasion of Ukraine. Read more in this series

Little Boy, the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, had a yield of 15 kilotons, or the equivalent of 15,000 tons of TNT. Fat Man, the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki, had a yield of 21 kilotons. These attacks followed the Trinity Test, and preceded hundreds of nuclear tests by the United States in Nevada and across Pacific islands, many of which spread fallout on the people downwind of the blasts.

The Soviet Union tested its first nuclear weapon in 1949, and both nations went on to develop hydrogen bombs, or thermonuclear weapons, which use fusion reactions to create much more explosive yields than the fission reactions of atomic warheads. The U.S. detonated its first thermonuclear device as part of Operation Ivy in 1952 at Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands; it had a yield equivalent to 10.4 million tons of TNT.

Thermonuclear weapons were designed for total war, capable of destroying whole cities on a scale far outpacing the devastation wrought on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Carried by long-range bombers and, later, intercontinental ballistic missiles fired from submarines, underground silos and mobile launcher vehicles, these became the strategic nuclear weapons. In 1960, the administration of President Dwight Eisenhower put together its strategy, classified until 2004, for overwhelming nuclear assault on cities in the Soviet Union and its allied countries in the event of a war, based on the power and multitude of U.S. nuclear weapons.

Tactical nuclear weapons

At the same time that the U.S. was developing these powerful warheads for long-range nuclear attacks, it was also working on smaller, shorter-range weapons that could function as a kind of super artillery if Soviet armies attacked into Europe. One of the more infamous of these tactical weapons was the “Atomic Annie,” a large artillery piece deployed to Europe in the 1950s. The cannon could fire a 15-kiloton nuclear warhead a distance of over 18 miles. By contrast, the Enola Gay B-29 bomber, which dropped the 15-kiloton warhead on Hiroshima, could fly 2,900 miles to a target before having to turn around.

Then there was the Davy Crockett warhead, which had a yield equivalent to just 20 tons of TNT. The recoilless rifle that fired it had an even shorter range than the Atomic Annie, up to just 2.5 miles. The shortest-range tactical nuclear device was the Special Atomic Demolition Munition, which was functionally a backpack-carried bomb designed to be set in place and detonated, in what was assumed to be a suicide mission.

The U.S. Army would eventually replace these nuclear novelties with warheads on short-range rockets, designed for use in battle The weapons were deployed with the U.S. military in Europe, in part, to indicate a willingness to use American nuclear weapons to defend European countries.

NATO, still a young alliance in the 1950s and ‘60s, was backed by the strength of the American military, but most U.S. forces were at least one ocean away. The USSR-led Warsaw Pact bordered the countries in which both alliances assumed any war in Europe would be fought, most especially West Germany. The USSR had the numbers of soldiers, tanks, and artillery on the ground to win a conventional war. U.S. nuclear weapons were proposed as a way to even those odds, but European allies had to be convinced that the U.S. would risk a nuclear war to defend Europe.

Deploying short-range tactical nuclear weapons in the path of any Soviet advance, wrote Tom Nichols, professor at the Naval War College, “warned the Soviets, in effect, that if Europe were invaded, the choice to use nuclear arms would be forced upon NATO by the successes of the Red Army.”

Had such an invasion ever come, the commanders in the field, given authorization to use nuclear weapons to avert defeat, would retreat after deployment. (Soviet plans for war were to specifically attack tactical nuclear sites.) The war would then either end in hours with an exchange of ICBMs, or with a ceasefire negotiated to prevent armageddon.

The escalation ladder

Defense intellectuals describe the steps between peace and thermonuclear oblivion through an “escalation ladder,” with the leadership of both countries at war taking actions that invite the other country to either escalate, by increasing the stakes and tensions, or de-escalate, by backing away from further conflict. Tactical nuclear weapons are the rung separating conventional battle from a nuclear war.

Soviet leaders developed their nuclear weapons and doctrine as a response to U.S. nuclear war planning, and awareness of U.S. nuclear deployments to Europe. Both the U.S. and USSR assumed that once tactical nuclear weapons were used, it was more likely that thermonuclear exchange, not deescalation, would follow.

“As we now know, the Soviet High Command wrestled with this dilemma, since taking a Europe in ashes defeated the whole point of invasion in the first place,” Nichols wrote. “They worked out their own plans for first-use of tactical nuclear arms, for massive use of tactical arms, and for nuclear retaliation. All of the options led to the same dead end of escalation, strategic retaliation, and catastrophe.”

That the inevitable end of a war in which tactical nuclear weapons are used is a catastrophe did not prevent the Soviet Union from developing the weapons, much as the U.S. had. Soviet tactical nuclear weapons included suitcase bombs, nuclear mines, nuclear artillery shells, missiles, short-range missiles fired from planes, and air-dropped bombs. Like the U.S, the USSR deployed its nonstrategic nuclear weapons at bases in allied countries.

Many of these weapons still exist. The U.S.’ legacy of tactical nuclear weapons continues with 100 B61 nuclear bombs deployed at bases in Europe. The B61 bomb, currently in the process of being upgraded, can be carried by a range of fighter jets, as well as inside B-2 bombers. The B61 is also the smallest yield of any nuclear weapon presently in the U.S. arsenal. Under the B61 mod 12, that yield can be toggled from a low of 300 tons to a maximum of 50 kilotons, the latter of which would make it 3.3 times as powerful as Little Boy, the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.

Russia, which inherited the nuclear weapons of the Soviet Union, has had to adjust its doctrine in light of changes in geopolitical realities. While the conventional army of the USSR and Warsaw Pact was massive enough that Soviet planners expected to never lose a conventional war in Europe, today several former Soviet republics are NATO members. The USSR could count on forces drawn from Ukraine for any war in Europe; in February Russia invaded Ukraine, an invasion that has struggled against massive resistance.

The end of the Cold War, and the collapse of the Soviet Union, changed the balance of conventional power between Russia and Europe. Both the United States and Russia continued to reduce their nuclear stockpiles, but many weapons persist. Russia maintains roughly 1,600 warheads paired to missiles or planes that can reach the U.S., while the U.S. maintains 1,650 warheads that can reach Russia, and 100 tactical nuclear bombs stationed in Europe.

In addition, Russia maintains an estimated arsenal of 1,912 nonstrategic nuclear weapons. Writers in the U.S. have theorized that such weapons may be used in battle as part of a bid to force a negotiated end to the war in Ukraine, though nothing observed in modern Russian military doctrine suggests this is the case.

Instead, tactical nuclear weapons remain in the arsenals of the U.S. and Russia, an inherited legacy of intricately planning all the stages of the kind of war that should never be fought.

From The New York Times, I’m Sabrina Tavernise. This is The Daily.

[music]

Today, as Russia tries to reset its war in Ukraine, one city has become central to Moscow’s strategy. My colleague, Valerie Hopkins, on what’s happening inside Mariupol and what the fight there tells us about the wider war. It’s Friday, April 1st. Valerie, this is a pretty dizzying week of news out of Ukraine. Catch me up on what happened.

valerie hopkins

So over the past week, we saw a series of moves by the Russians that sent pretty mixed signals. First, about a week ago, the defense ministry in Moscow announced that they were shifting their strategy. They said that the first phase of the war was over, that they were going to be reducing their combat in the west while consolidating their military gains in the east. But at the same time that they said that, they started sending missiles to the west, and they continued their assault on Kyiv. So it was pretty unclear if they would stick to their word. And then, in the middle of the week, we saw another round of talks between the Russians and the Ukrainians, where it kind of looked, for a minute, like some kind of deal could happen. But then the Russians actually came out and said they were a very long way from the agreement, and they would just continue their campaign.

sabrina tavernise

OK, so it sounds like things on the ground are in flux, at least when it comes to territory. But the bombings and the fighting are continuing. So what’s the upshot here? Are the Russians losing?

valerie hopkins

Well, I mean, the Russians have been losing territory around Kyiv. They say that they’re sort of preparing to withdraw from that area, but NATO officials have pretty much concluded that they’re actually regrouping rather than retreating. There’s just so much skepticism from Western officials. The bottom line is they say they’re watching what Russia does rather than what it says.

sabrina tavernise

So Valerie, you’ve been in Ukraine now since the war began. You’ve been covering it every day. I’m wondering what you’re focusing on now.

valerie hopkins

Well, one of the places I can’t take my eyes off is Mariupol, where Russia’s claims definitely don’t match with reality. Russia has waged a brutal siege campaign around this port city for more than a month. They’re portraying their efforts as key to their war of liberation, of helping Ukrainians who they think want to be part of Russia become part of Russia. But in reality, it’s a brutal campaign against a city that’s critical to Russia’s strategy for taking and growing its territorial gains.

sabrina tavernise

Explain that. Why is Mariupol so critical?

valerie hopkins

So Mariupol is a big port city that was, before the war, home to about half a million people. It’s really close to the Russian border. And it’s also very close to Russian-occupied territory in Eastern Ukraine. Right now, it’s the last sliver of Ukrainian territory along the strategic body of water, the Sea of Azov. So controlling Mariupol would not only mean controlling its port but it would also create what we call a land bridge from the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014, to these territories in the east that Russia also controls. So it would be a crucial resupply route and just this kind of strategic symbol of victory for Russia.

Got it. So taking Mariupol would mean that they really gained this important stronghold. It’s like the last puzzle piece in this whole part of Ukraine South.

valerie hopkins

Exactly, Sabrina.

sabrina tavernise

So what’s actually happening in Mariupol?

valerie hopkins

Well, we know it’s being heavily bombed. But beyond that, it’s really hard to tell. The siege of the city started very early in March. Over the last four weeks, the power and the water got shut off. The communications went down at the very beginning of March. And around that same time, the Russians effectively encircled the city. Around mid-March, some people were able to get out as part of a humanitarian corridor. But since then, the situation has grown more dire by the day and by the week. People are running out of food and water. People have been sheltering in basements. However, it’s very difficult to be able to get accurate, up-to-date information while it’s happening from there, simply because of the lack of connection to the city.

sabrina tavernise

Right. I wanted to ask, how do you report on a place you can’t talk to?

valerie hopkins

It’s pretty hard. But occasionally, people inside Mariupol are able to get a signal. There’s a few spots inside the city, and they’re able to post something on Facebook or Telegram or Instagram about the situation. And a big part of what I do is just scouring social media, watching these videos, trying to get a sense of what the situation is on the ground and how much it’s changed from day to day or week to week. And—

[phone rings]

—I’ve also spent a lot of time on the phone, talking to people who’ve somehow managed to make it out. Hello?

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

One woman whose story really stuck out to me was this woman, Kristina.

sabrina tavernise

Tell me about Kristina.

valerie hopkins

Kristina is 28. She’s married. She has two young kids who are six and eight years old. I talked to her on the phone some days after she had escaped from Mariupol.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

And she told me in great detail, and with tremendous pain, about what the past few weeks have been like for her there.

[music]

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

She started out describing what it was like for her when the siege began in early March, when the Russians cut off the phone service and the electricity while continuing, and actually intensifying, their airstrikes. She described this moment when the airstrikes hit the building right next to her. And the war had basically arrived in her front yard.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

And she said she was standing near a window in her apartment, looking outside, talking with her husband. It was really quiet, she said. Then suddenly—

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

—a bomb hit right next to her building.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

She said, suddenly, three houses were just gone. She said her neighbors ran outside and found the body of an 11-year-old girl and her grandfather.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

And this airstrike also shatters the windows of Kristina’s building. So she and her family moved to the corridor of her building, where they think they’ll be safer from more shelling. And this begins a period where they’re, for the most part, too afraid to go out. Because she’s afraid that the shelling will hit them.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

So she tells me about what it was like for her and her family to be essentially living now in their hallway. They have to live without windows and without heat. And it’s actually minus 7 degrees Celsius, which is really, really cold.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

And they’re also starting to run out of food. So she’s going into her pantry. She’s trying to make what little food she had last for a long time. And—

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

—she said there was no gas, so they had to build a fire right inside the entrance to the building and cook their meals there, over an open flame.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

And for a while, they had had one meal a day. But as the bombing increased, people were sometimes scared to go to that entrance to light the fire and cook even that one meal.

kristina [SIGHS] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

And fairly early on, they started rationing the water supplies. Her husband would go out and try to collect it. People in Mariupol, some of them were walking six miles every day to get a few liters of water from wells or other sources. They were collecting rainwater and melting snow. And—

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

—she told me about how they had this tiny teapot. And they had a family meeting and agreed that the first half of the day, between her, her husband, her two kids, and her mother-in-law, they would share this tiny teapot of water. And in the evening, they would also all drink about a teapot of the water.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

And she said, after the first week, those two teapots a day between five people became one. And after a while—

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

—some days, there was also just no water. She would say how her kids would cry because of hunger and thirst. And they were sort of fading. And as they sat in this corridor, she said she tried to distract them with books and reading fairy tales and—

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

—even teaching math.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

But she said that they were so hungry and tired that—

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

—the fire had left their eyes.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

And she said, every day they would sit in the corridor and pray and, essentially, prepare to say goodbye to their lives.

[music]

It went on like this for a couple of weeks. And then—

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

—in mid-March, her own apartment building took a direct hit. The strike killed three children and two adults.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

They were her neighbors.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

And she decided, right there and then, that, even though it was incredibly dangerous, to try to get out of the city in that moment, while it was under siege and under such intense shelling. It would be even more dangerous to stay. She felt they had to leave, or they would die there. But there was a problem.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

They had two cars, enough to take their whole family. But they only had enough gas for one of them.

[music]

sabrina tavernise

We’ll be right back. Valerie, you told us that Kristina and her family were facing this impossible decision. They didn’t have enough gas for everybody to leave Mariupol. So what did they do?

valerie hopkins

Well, there was enough space in the car for her father but not for his parents. And he doesn’t want to leave them alone.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

So the older family members decide to stay in Mariupol. And Kristina and the kids and her husband go. And as Kristina and her family start driving,

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

—that’s when she told me she saw the full extent of what had happened her city.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

She said it was a terrible picture, that there were no roads left, utility poles lying on their sides, shells and shrapnel everywhere, and lots of dead people.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

And she told me how she felt guilty as a mom that she wasn’t able to cover her children’s eyes and prevent them from seeing the destruction and the corpses. And as they’re driving in this long, slow line of cars, there’s so much ordnance on the road, actually, that she talks about how lots of people have tire blow-outs. And there’s broken bridges and all these other obstacles. But the main obstacle, for them, actually, are these Russian checkpoints that are pretty common. I think she mentioned passing, like, 15 of them. And at the final checkpoint—

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

—she mentions these Russian soldiers who are sort of showing off.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

They’re trying to look as if they are these liberating, benefactor good guys—

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

—handing out candy and chocolate to her kids. And Kristina is really conflicted. On the one hand, she’s livid. These are the forces that have just bombed her city to destruction and forced her to leave her home. But on the other hand, she doesn’t want her kids to be scared. She says she has to lie to her children.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

She told them they’re actually Ukrainian soldiers, and she allows them to take the candy.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

So after 12 hours of driving, Sabrina, they reach the city of Zaporizhzhia, which is usually a three-hour drive. And she told me that she and her family arrived and went inside a center for people displaced from Mariupol and saw food and water and supplies and just burst into tears. She said—

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

—it would seem like such a simple thing—

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

—a cup of tea and a piece of bread.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

But they were like miracles.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

And she told me that, on the one hand, she realized that she’d arrived, and she was safe, and she had gotten out.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

But all of her feelings about that were tempered because of the people that she’d left behind. And she’s since left Ukraine and gone to the Czech Republic. But she’s still trying to stay in touch with her father and her grandparents, who remain back in Mariupol. Shortly after she left, she got a message from her dad saying they were now living with no roof and no food and no water. And then, a few days later, he got in touch again to ask how he could leave. And then, finally, the last time she’s heard from him was a while ago. And he said that they’d run out of medicine for her grandma and that they still can’t find any gas and that Russian troops had taken control of their part of the city.

[music]

sabrina tavernise

Valerie, Kristina’s story is so wrenching. But she left two weeks ago. So I guess I’m wondering, where do things stand now in Mariupol? How much of the city do the Russians control?

valerie hopkins

Well, Sabrina, it’s really difficult to tell. Because there’s so little information coming out, and the fighting seems to still be raging. But I recently spoke to the mayor, who said he did estimate that about 50 percent of the city is under Russian control.

sabrina tavernise

And how many people are left in the city, and who are they?

valerie hopkins

I’ve heard so many different estimates, from 100,000 people left to 160,000 people left. The mayor is calling for a full evacuation of the city. And it’s going to be difficult. Because most of the people who are left are older, elderly, infirm people. And the pictures and videos that we’ve seen coming out of Mariupol in recent days, including with people who have been embedded with Russian forces, tend to confirm that. But one reason that the estimates are also tricky is that we don’t really know what’s happening to people who are in neighborhoods that are being taken by Russian forces. There are hundreds and hundreds of reports of Russian forces coming in to a neighborhood, finding the bomb shelters or the collective centers where people are sheltering, and taking them out of the city and bringing them either to Russia-held territory further east and then directly to Russia.

sabrina tavernise

Wait, taking them?

valerie hopkins

Well, it’s very unclear. The Russians, of course, are trying to present themselves as liberators. And they need to show evidence of the people that they’ve liberated. So that’s why they’re handing out chocolate to kids. And that’s why they are encouraging people to come to Russian-held territory and possibly to Russia. But then there are other stories that are more horrific, of people being taken places, having their fingerprints taken, photographed, and then having their documents taken away from them. And they are waiting to find out what’s going to happen to them.

sabrina tavernise

Wow, effectively, prisoners.

valerie hopkins

Well, that is certainly what the city administration of Mariupol is saying. And they actually estimate that between 20,000 and 30,000 people may have had this happen to them. And they also estimate that 2,000 kids have had this fate. And I spoke to a grandfather who’s been trying to get his 12-year-old granddaughter back, who was taken to Donetsk, a Russian-held city now. And he has no way of communicating with the authorities there or organizing her transfer.

sabrina tavernise

So Valerie, the picture you’re painting here is incredibly dark. And this is a very, very bleak situation for Ukrainians in Mariupol. And I guess what I’m wondering is, what would a Russian victory in Mariupol mean for the future of the war?

valerie hopkins

Well, Sabrina, of course, territorially, it would be a victory for Russia, even if the whole city is completely destroyed. But I think that, in many ways, whether or not Mariupol falls, it’s not really the point.

[music]

This brutal campaign has already sent a message to Ukraine and to the world and, especially, definitely, to the people of Mariupol about just how far Putin is willing to go. We talked about looking at what Russia does and not what it says. And Mariupol is what Russia is doing.

sabrina tavernise

Valerie, thank you.

valerie hopkins

Thank you, Sabrina.

[music]

sabrina tavernise

On Friday morning, a convoy from the International Committee of the Red Cross that had been on its way to Mariupol to facilitate a large-scale evacuation of civilians had to turn back after, quote, “arrangements and conditions made it impossible to proceed.” Separately, a limited number of buses with civilians made it out of the city. But it was not clear if more would be allowed to leave. Kristina said she did not know whether her father and grandparents were among those able to get out. We’ll be right back.

[music]

Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording (joe biden) Today, I want to talk about one aspect of Putin’s war that affects and has real effects on American people, Putin’s price hike that Americans and our allies are feeling at the pump.

sabrina tavernise

On Thursday, President Biden said he would release up to 180 million barrels of oil from the U.S. Strategic Reserves over the next six months in an effort to lower gas prices that have surged as a result of the war in Ukraine and sanctions against Russia’s energy industry.

archived recording (joe biden) There isn’t enough supply. And the bottom line is if we want lower gas prices, we need to have more oil supply right now.

sabrina tavernise

It is the largest release of oil from the emergency stockpile since the Strategic Reserve was created in the early 1970s. And a lower court in New York state ruled that the state’s newly drawn congressional maps were unconstitutional, a decision that could block their use in this year’s midterm elections. A judge ruled that the map drawing process, overseen by the Democratic majority, had been tainted. He gave the legislature until April 11 to come up with fairer maps for U.S. Congress and the state legislature. The ruling is likely to be appealed, but if it stands, it could endanger a major achievement by Democrats over the past few years— the creation of an even congressional map that no longer favors Republicans.

BUCHA, Ukraine — The Russian forces that were intent on overwhelming Kyiv at the war’s start with tanks and artillery retreated under fire across a broad front on Saturday, leaving behind them dead soldiers and burned vehicles, according to witnesses, Ukrainian officials, satellite images and military analysts.

The withdrawal suggested the possibility of a major turn in the six-week war — the collapse, at least for now, of Russia’s initial attempt to seize Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, and the end of its hopes for the quick subjugation of the nation.

Moscow has described the withdrawal as a tactical move to regroup and reposition its forces for a major push in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. While there are early indications that the military is following through on that plan, analysts say it cannot obscure the magnitude of the defeat.

“The initial Russian operation was a failure and one of its central goals — the capture of Kyiv — proved unobtainable for Russian forces,” Michael Kofman, the director of Russian studies at C.N.A., a research institute in Arlington, Va., said in a telephone interview Saturday.

Elsewhere in Ukraine, Russian attacks continued unabated, and the Pentagon has cautioned that the formations near Kyiv could be repositioning for renewed assaults.

In the south, an aid convoy organized by the International Committee of the Red Cross that had stalled on its way to bring some relief to the besieged city of Mariupol was on the move again. The hope, repeatedly frustrated by Russian shelling, was to bring emergency supplies to trapped residents and to evacuate hundreds of those who have endured weeks of bombardment that has left shortages of food and water.

In the suburban towns north of Kyiv, the Ukrainian army was advancing through a tableau of destruction, with dozens of wrecked tanks on streets, extensive damage to buildings and the bodies of civilians still lying uncollected. Kyiv and its surroundings, which had echoed with artillery booms and gunfire for weeks, had gone quiet.

Ukraine’s military on Saturday moved into Bucha, a key town on the west bank of the Dnipro River — which divides Kyiv — days after Russian forces had sacked it on their way out.

“They went from apartment to apartment collecting televisions and computers, loaded them on their tanks and left,” Svetlana Semenova, a retiree, said of the Russian departure, which she described as chaotic. “They left in a hurry.”

A few dozen people who had been living mostly in basements for a month staggered outside to collect food — bags of potatoes and bread — brought by Ukrainian soldiers.

Elena Shur, 43, an accountant for Ukraine’s national airline, said the first sign of the Ukrainian military came on Friday, when a civilian car carrying soldiers drove through town waving the country’s flag.

“We saw people on the street, and soldiers,” Ms. Shur said. “I cried.”

Reporters counted six bodies of civilians on the streets and sidewalks of Bucha. It was unclear under what circumstances they had died, but the discarded packaging of a Russian military ration was lying beside one man who had been shot in the head.

As photos of casualties in Bucha emerged, a senior adviser to Ukraine’s president said on Saturday that some of the dead wearing civilian clothes appeared to have been bound and executed.

“The bodies of people with tied hands, who were shot dead by soldiers lie in the streets,” the adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said on Twitter. “These people were not in the military. They had no weapons. They posed no threat.” He included an image of a scene, photographed by Agence France-Presse, showing three bodies on the side of a road, one with hands apparently tied behind the back. The New York Times was unable to independently verify Mr. Podolyak’s claim the people had been executed.

The town was the site of a major Ukrainian ambush of a Russian armored column in the first days of the war, and one street was blocked by dozens of incinerated tanks and trucks.

Despite that setback, the Russians had captured Bucha and held it for about a month. They executed half a dozen members of the Territorial Defense Force — the volunteer army many Ukrainians joined when the war started — leaving the bodies in a heavily mined part of town, said Varvara Kaminskaya, 69.

The Ukrainians have advanced at least another 15 miles to the northwest of Bucha, where they now fly Ukrainian flags over former Russian checkpoints.

After their initial assault on the capital failed, the Russian army had dug into defensive positions outside of Kyiv, suggesting an intention to hold a front line near the city. In an artillery war, trenches afford soldiers the best chance of survival.

Those were abandoned in and around Bucha on Saturday. On the northern edge of town were the abandoned berms that had sheltered Russian artillery emplacements, surrounded by green boxes and hundreds of empty shell cases.

“According to our information, they are running away from all areas around Kyiv,” said Sgt. Ihor Zaichuk, the commander of the 1st company of the 2nd Azov battalion in the Ukrainian army, which fought in Bucha.

“They can say on their own television stations, if they want, that they are the second most powerful army in the world,” he said. “But they aren’t anymore.”

He cautioned, however, that the Russians might return. “Only their commanders know if they will be re-equipped and return.” Even as cars lined up on some roads, making their way back into Kyiv, workers were building new defenses from heavy logs.

On the east bank of the Dnipro, Ukrainian forces were pressing forward in villages dozens of miles from the capital, according to an intelligence officer with the S.B.U., the Ukrainian domestic intelligence service, who declined to be identified for security reasons.

Analysts said that Moscow’s stated decision to refocus its military on the Donbas in eastern Ukraine is likely to be accurate, but mostly because they had little option.

“The Russians are adjusting their goals to reality,” Lawrence Freedman, emeritus professor of war studies at King’s College London, said in an interview on Saturday. “I think they know they’re in trouble, so I don’t think it’s a ruse to say they’re concentrating on the Donbas, because in reality that’s all they can do.”

Mr. Kofman, the expert on the Russian military, said the Russian army had lost about 2,000 pieces of equipment that was either destroyed, captured or abandoned, including about 350 tanks.

As the Russians retreated, they left mines and booby traps behind in an effort to slow the Ukrainians’ pursuit, according to Ukrainian officers in different towns. In the suburb of Irpin, which the Ukrainians had recaptured before Bucha, demining operations were in full swing on Saturday. Some civilian bodies had been booby-trapped to kill emergency workers, Ukrainian officials said.

One group of military engineers, dressed in heavy blue Kevlar armor, had tied a rope to a body. They pulled on it, to see if the motion would trigger booby traps. By late in the day, however, the body remained there, with the engineers apparently unable to ascertain if it was safe to collect.

In the village of Dmytrivka, west of the capital, there were signs of a hasty Russian retreat from a scene of carnage. On a forest road leading out of the village, nine tanks and armored vehicles lay destroyed and gutted by fire, the detritus of a tank battle three days earlier. The turrets and heavy guns of two tanks lay tossed aside. Inside one armored personnel carrier, the burned human remains of men were visible.

Valentina Yatsevich, 58, a villager walking past the wrecks toward her home, said, “They did not leave, they were destroyed.”

In Russia itself, the retreat caused consternation among the war’s cheerleaders, with state television having previously raised expectations that the Russian military would capture Kyiv.

Semyon Pegov, a popular pro-Kremlin war blogger embedded with the Russian troops, posted a video to the social messaging app Telegram on Saturday describing the move as “a withdrawal, not a flight.”

The retreat was necessitated, he said, by Russia’s stretched-out supply lines and the threat of further losses as its troops tried to survive in field conditions facing a much better supplied and fortified enemy.

It was an effort, mirrored by other pro-Kremlin outlets, to explain why Russia seemed to have sharply scaled back its war aims in recent days, after taking painful losses in fighting for the Kyiv suburbs.

Russian hard-liners calling for an assault on Kyiv saw the retreat as a disappointment. “I don’t know why this decision was made,” Aleksandr Kots, a war correspondent for the Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda, wrote on Telegram. “The war is only beginning. We’ll figure out later who was right and who was at fault.”

The Kremlin maintained its defiance as state television released an interview with Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin’s spokesman, characterizing the United States as being at the root of Europe’s ills. He expressed confidence that European countries would renew relations with Russia once they “sober up a little from the American bourbon.”

In Lithuania, President Gitanas Nauseda announced that his country would no longer import Russian gas starting this month. “If we can do it, the rest of Europe can do it too,” he wrote on Twitter. The European Union is looking for ways to reduce Europe’s dependency on Russian oil and gas.

In other developments on Saturday, Pope Francis, visiting the Mediterranean island nation of Malta, edged closer to blaming President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia for the war in Ukraine than he had before. In an address to Maltese dignitaries and officials, the pope blamed a “potentate, sadly caught up in anachronistic claims of nationalist interests” for casting “dark shadows of war” from Europe’s east.

Francis has declined to explicitly blame Mr. Putin or Russia as the aggressor for various reasons, including the Vatican’s hopes of playing a role in a potential peace agreement. But on Saturday, he clearly seemed to be speaking about Mr. Putin, who he said was “provoking and fomenting conflicts.”

Ukraine says it foiled attempted Russian missile attack on Odesa region

Ukraine’s military has said that its anti-air defences had foiled an attempted Russian missile attack on critical infrastructure in the major Black Sea port of Odesa.

Governor Maksym Marchenko earlier said three missiles had hit a residential area, adding there were casualties.

“The enemy tried in an insidious way to hit critical infrastructure facilities, the destruction of which could be dangerous for the civilian population,” the Ukrainian military’s southern command said in a Facebook post.

“Thanks to the timely and effective response of the air defence forces, the missiles did not hit the targets the enemy had been aiming at,” it said.

War in Ukraine fuels fears among draft-age Russian youths

As Moscow’s forces bog down in Ukraine, many young Russians of the draft age have been increasingly jittery about the prospect of being sent into combat.

Making those fears particularly acute is an annual spring conscription that begins on Friday and aims to round up 134,500 men for a one-year tour of military duty.

Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu pledged at a meeting of the military brass this week that the recruits will not be sent to front lines or “hotspots”.

But the statement was met with scepticism by many in Russia who remember the separatist wars in the southern republic of Chechnya in the 1990s and the early 2000s, when thousands of poorly trained young men were killed.

“I don’t trust them when they say they won’t send conscripts into combat. They lie all the time,” said Vladislav, a 22-year-old who is completing his studies and fears he could face the draft immediately after graduation.

Ukraine hopes for ‘super modern’ equipment for air force

Ukraine’s ambassador to Japan, Sergiy Korsunsky, has told the media that the country might soon be able to better protect itself from Russian air attacks because it is expecting to get “super modern” equipment from the US and the United Kingdom.

“They still have superiority in air force, in airplanes and missiles, and we expect to begin to receive super-modern equipment from the United States and Britain to protect our skies and our cities,” Korsunsky said.

In a series of tweets on Thursday, Ukraine’s air force said it needed “Patriot systems from the US or the cheaper, more mobile NASAMS system from Norway”.

Both Patriot and NASAMS are surface-to-air missile systems.

To effectively protect 🇺🇦, the optimal solution would be Patriot systems from the 🇺🇲 or the cheaper, more mobile NASAMS systems from 🇳🇴.

Russia redeploying forces from Georgia to Ukraine, UK says

The UK Ministry of Defence has said Russia is redeploying forces from Georgia to help with its war in Ukraine, a move it said highlights Moscow’s “unexpected losses” in the invasion.

“Between 1,200 and 2,000 of these Russian troops are being reorganised into 3x Battalion Tactical Groups,” the defence ministry said in a Twitter post.

“It is highly unlikely that Russia planned to generate reinforcements in this manner and it is indicative of the unexpected losses it has sustained during the invasion.”

Russian forces took Ukrainian troops as hostages from Chernobyl: Kyiv

Ukraine’s nuclear agency Energoatom says Russian forces have taken Ukrainian troops as hostages with them as they left the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.

“As they ran away from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the Russian occupiers took members of the National Guard, whom they had held hostage since February 24, with them,” Energoatom said in a statement on Telegram, citing plant workers.

It was unclear how many Ukrainian servicemen had been taken away.

US renews warnings for Americans to leave Russia and Ukraine

The US Department of State has renewed warnings for American citizens in Russia and Ukraine to leave the countries immediately.

“We are warning US citizens that the Russian government security officials in both Russia and Ukraine may be singling out US citizens based on their nationality,” spokesperson Ned Price told reporters on Thursday.

Earlier this week, an update to the official US travel advisory for Russia said: “Russian security services have arrested US citizens on spurious charges, singled out US citizens in Russia for detention and/or harassment, denied them fair and transparent treatment, and have convicted them in secret trials and/or without presenting credible evidence.”

Russian troops have left Chernobyl, Ukraine says

Russian troops have left Ukraine’s Chernobyl nuclear power plant (NPP) after weeks of occupation, officials in Kyiv have said.

“There are no longer any outsiders on the territory of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant,” Ukraine’s state agency in charge of the Chernobyl exclusion zone said on Facebook.

The UN nuclear watchdog, IAEA, also confirmed that it had been informed by Ukraine that Russian forces handed control of the power plant and “moved convoys of troops”.

The agency said it would send the “first assistance and support mission to the Chornobyl NPP in the next few days”.

Italy and Germany say they agree on importance of sanctions against Russia

Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz agreed on a phone call about the importance of keeping up sanctions against Russia, which are “proving very effective”, Draghi’s office has said.

The phone call between the two leaders comes after Putin threatened to halt contracts supplying Europe with a third of its gas unless they are paid in Russian currency.

US says Russia’s roubles-for-gas demand is sign of ‘desperation’

Putin’s demand that foreign buyers pay for Russian gas in roubles is a sign of Moscow’s economic and financial “desperation”, US Department of State spokesperson Ned Price has said.

European nations, some of which rely heavily on Russian gas, have rejected the demand, with the German government saying it amounted to “blackmail”.

“I think fundamentally this is just another indication of the dire straits that Russia’s economy is in,” Price told reporters during a news briefing, adding that it was up to countries in Europe to determine their response.

Ukraine war should not hinder Iran deal revival, US analysts say

Detractors of the Iran nuclear deal have added Russia’s involvement in talks to revive the multilateral pact to their long list of grievances against the agreement, as Russian forces continue their offensive in Ukraine.

However, supporters of the accord, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), say the conflict in Ukraine should intensify – not blunt – efforts to restore it.

Five weeks after Russian troops hurtled into the country in the hope of swiftly seizing the capital, installing a friendly government and subjugating Ukraine, the Russian military appears to be shrinking its goals to prioritize the east, redeploying forces that had been destined for the Kyiv region and attempting to organize reinforcements to compensate for the thousands of troops that have been killed.

The move represents a new and substantially different phase of the war as Russia withdraws its troops from battered northern and western areas to focus eastward, where it has already wreaked massive destruction and deprivation, most notably in the city of Mariupol, where as many as 100,000 people remained trapped in grim conditions.

The shift reflects a recognition in Moscow that Russia can no longer accomplish its original goals, analysts say. After making initial gains, its forces have stalled on most of the fronts they advanced on, and they have meanwhile suffered huge losses in terms of equipment and soldiers.

Washington and other Western capitals have expressed skepticism about Russia’s declared intent of refocusing on the east, with officials saying that Russia appears to be in the process of regrouping and repositioning its forces rather than limiting its goals.

And what lies ahead could prove just as bloody as Russia compensates for its failure to make significant advances on the ground by targeting civilian areas with missiles and airstrikes. It also sets up the likelihood of a longer war, at least than the one Russia originally anticipated.

But it also defers, perhaps indefinitely, the broader threat to Ukraine as a whole, fundamentally changing the nature of the war.

“Russia has lost the big war,” said Phillips O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at St. Andrews University in Scotland. “The big war is over”

The pullback has provided a clearer picture of the human suffering the Russians are leaving in their wake in areas near Kyiv. Video posted to social media Saturday and verified by The Washington Post showed at least nine people, including a child, laying in the street of a single neighborhood in the town of Bucha, northwest of the capital. Some of the dead were huddled together on the side of the road.

Kyiv’s suburbs bore the brunt of the Russian onslaught, weathering the storm that was intended for the capital. In those small towns to Kyiv’s north and east, the Russian pullback was most visible.

In Irpin, a suburb once known for its riverside picnics and quick commute into the city, Ukrainian fighters had fought the Russians back block by block for weeks.

At night, mortars and artillery shells rained down on the rows of quaint homes, some of which had been occupied by soldiers on both sides. Nearly every resident had fled. On Saturday, the few that had remained shoveled and swept debris from their yards and contemplated their first nights in their beds after relocating their lives to basements.

It was too early for most of the town’s former residents to contemplate returning, and officials — both local and military — have cautioned against it until thorough demining operations have taken place.

“After 25 days of nonstop shelling, the silence makes you uncomfortable,” said Ruslan Stepura, 44, a soldier in a volunteer battalion that defended Irpin. “But when it’s silent, it’s like a miracle.”

Now that the adrenaline had worn off, it was hard for him and others who had fought for the town to believe what they were seeing: a hellscape of shattered glass, burned-out cars and obliterated public infrastructure.

But there were also signs of a return to some sliver of a past life. “Traffic jams are coming back,” Stepura said, gesturing at a line of vehicles, some carrying civilians, waiting to enter the suburb of Bilohorodka, west of Kyiv. “Soon, it will be like it was before the war.”

Gone, at least for now, is the threat of a blood-drenched assault on Kyiv, along with Russian hopes of installing a puppet government, analysts say. It is now highly unlikely the Russians will be able to reassemble a force capable of seizing the capital any time soon, given the failures of the initial invasion, O’Brien said.

The scale of the losses inflicted on the Russian military so far leaves Moscow with few options other than to try to concentrate its forces on a smaller area, O’Brien said. Russia’s best hope now lies in capturing enough of eastern Ukraine to exact concessions from the Ukrainian government at the negotiating table, he said.

Whether the Russian leadership has given up its strategic goal of ultimately subjugating Ukraine isn’t clear, said Rob Lee, a former U.S. Marine who is now a senior fellow with the Foreign Policy Research Institute. But the withdrawal from the Kyiv area suggests a recognition on the part of Russia’s military command that its army isn’t up to the challenge of the war it set out to fight.

“It’s an acknowledgment that their first efforts failed, that they don’t have the forces to encircle Kyiv,” he said.

The extent of the failure was evident as Russian troops began abandoning their positions in northern Ukraine over the past few days, leaving behind a trail of destroyed armor, littered belongings and charred, disfigured bodies, according to videos posted online by advancing Ukrainian forces and journalists.

Troops have withdrawn from key locations that they captured in the first days of the conflict, including the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and the airport at Hostomel, which was intended to serve as a launching point for the push into Kyiv. Instead, Ukrainian forces pinned them down in Irpin, now under Ukrainian control, and the Russians never managed to advance any further.

The Ukrainians are attacking the Russians as they leave, inflicting more losses and making it hard to tell whether the Russians are withdrawing according to a plan or whether they are being forced to retreat, said Thomas Bulloch, an intelligence analyst with Janes, a defense consultancy.

It had been assumed that the Russians would leave forces dug in the vicinity of Kyiv to prevent the Ukrainians from drawing reinforcements for the new battle to the east, and to sustain pressure on the capital. It’s now unclear whether they even intend to do that, or whether a force large enough to defend itself will remain, he said.

“There’s no question that they’re withdrawing now and it looks like it’s going to be bigger than we first expected,” he said.

Much will now depend on the extent to which Russia is able to replenish and reinvigorate the ranks of its shrunken force — depleted by as many as 40,000 soldiers due to deaths, injuries, captures and surrenders, according to a senior NATO official, and more according to the Ukrainians.

The military is in the process of calling up new conscripts, which could add 100,000 more soldiers to its ranks. It is also generating 10 new battalion tactical groups, the core fighting unit of the Russian army, to replace some of those lost in the first weeks of fighting, said a senior Western official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive subjects.

Of the 120 battalion tactical groups that went into action in Ukraine, at least 20 have been rendered inoperative by losses of men and equipment, he said — a figure likely to be higher since the Ukrainian advances in recent days.

The new troops are being drawn from the Kaliningrad oblast adjoining Poland, the Far East and Georgia, and all the available evidence suggests they will be sent to the Donbas, with the goal of taking control of the portion of the region that wasn’t captured by Russian forces in 2014, the official said.

Russia is also expected to sustain pressure on the other parts of eastern and southern Ukraine that it captured in the first days of the war, including Kharkiv and the strip of territory running along the coast that links Donbas to the annexed peninsula of Crimea. Russia will probably eventually take control of the besieged city of Mariupol, which will free up thousands of troops to fight elsewhere.

By concentrating its firepower on a limited area, Russia should be able to muster a more effective force, said Bulloch. It will also help them address the logistical and supply problems that have plagued troops strung out along a vast front line around the country.

“It positions them better for a longer war because by concentrating their forces in a smaller area they can do more sustained operations,” he said.

But it’s not certain that Russia has the capacity even to fully pursue its goals in the east, some experts believe. Ukrainian forces have been making advances in Kharkiv and elsewhere in the south and east, and will probably continue to inflict losses on Russian forces as they seek to regroup.

The 190,000 troops that launched the initial invasion included 75 percent of the country’s combat-ready troops, according to the Pentagon, and the replacements won’t be as capable or well trained as those, the Western official said.

The troops being withdrawn from northern Ukraine are unlikely to be more effective in a new location than they were in the initial invasion, said John Spencer, who chairs the Urban Warfare Studies program at the Madison Policy Forum.

“These forces are exhausted,” he said. “Soldiers can’t keep up this level of losses and sustain the pace. They are demoralized, they have wounds, mental injuries, they’ve lost their friends, you can’t just throw them into another fight.”

“It’s not going to be a cakewalk,” said Dmitri Alperovitch, Chairman of Silverado Policy Accelerator, a geopolitical think tank, noting that some of Ukraine’s best trained and battle-hardened troops are located in the Donbas, where they have been holding Russian-backed forces at bay for the past eight years.

It’s also not going to be easy for Russia to justify a more limited goal to the Russian public, he said.

“This is going to be a huge political problem for them because the costs they’ve incurred in this war, the economic and political isolation they’re suffering in addition to the military losses, are just not worth it for the Donbas,” he said. “It’s one thing to say you’re fighting for Ukraine. It’s another thing to say, we’ll settle for Donbas and try to sell it to the domestic market.”

Indeed, Russia’s withdrawal from some regions has ignited strong opposition from hard-liners in state television and Telegram channels, with many, including Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, arguing that Russia should fight on and seize control of Kyiv.

After the stall of Russia’s advance, Moscow’s negotiators in talks with Ukraine agreed to de-escalate the war around Kyiv and Chernihiv and to focus on the eastern Donbas region, prominent state television anchor Vladimir Solovyov, complained.

“Don’t mislead and demoralize our people and our troops with crazy messages,” he said, referring to talk of “de-escalating” in Kyiv and Chernihiv.

Russia may be hoping that if it manages to take Donbas, it will be able at some future point to launch offensives to take a broader swathe of the country. But that seems unfeasible given the losses it has suffered so far, O’Brien said.

“Theoretically they can try again, but it would take a major new army. This army does not have the strength,” he said.

Lee questioned whether Russia can afford to sustain a protracted conflict, given the toll that sanctions will take on its economy and the scale of the military losses it has incurred. The longer the war goes on, the greater the damage to Russia’s overall strategic standing and ability to defend itself from other threats elsewhere, he said.

The war is far from over, cautioned said Iuliaa Mendel, a former spokesperson for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, speaking from Lviv. Ukrainians are braced for all eventualities, she said.

“This phase could go on for a while,” she said. “Russia has a lot of missiles and rockets and still has a lot of soldiers.”

But the withdrawal from Kyiv and the shift in the direction of the war has lifted spirits, at least in Western Ukraine, she said. “We feel we can win,” she said. “People are starting to talk about when they can go home.”

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.
