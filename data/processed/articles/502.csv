On the other hand, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the highest court of the UN (also based in The Hague), ordered on Wednesday the immediate cessation of the Russian offensive in Ukraine.

The G7 ministers urged Russia to “obey” this order, which the Kremlin had rejected hours earlier.

Although the rulings of the International Court of Justice are binding and unappealable, the Court, which bases its conclusions mainly on treaties and conventions, has no means to enforce them.

The Ministers remain appalled about Russia’s continuing war against Ukraine and reiterated their profound condemnation of the ongoing aggression as well as the involvement of Belarus in it. Ministers demanded that the Russian leadership immediately complies with the order of the International Court of Justice to stop the assault on Ukraine, its population and civilian infrastructures, including hospitals and schools, and to immediately withdraw its military forces. The siege of Mariupol and other cities and the denial of humanitarian aid are unacceptable. Ministers demanded that Russia upholds its obligations under international humanitarian law and human rights law. The Russian leadership has to immediately provide for humanitarian access as well as humanitarian aid to be delivered to Mariupol and other besieged cities.

Ministers condemned in the strongest possible terms the indiscriminate attacks on civilians. Due to President Putin’s unprovoked and shameful war, millions are forced to flee their homes; the destruction of infrastructure, hospitals, theatres and schools is ongoing. Russia’s blatant violation of international law has already isolated its government internationally and will further do so. The Ministers welcomed and supported the order on the provisional measures by the International Court of Justice, and strongly urged Russia to comply with the provisional measures order, which is binding on the parties.

Ministers underscored that those responsible for war crimes, including indiscriminate use of weapons against civilians, will be held responsible. Ministers welcomed the ongoing work to investigate and gather evidence, including by the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court.

Ministers recalled that the G7, along with their allies, have imposed unprecedented sanctions in response to the war of aggression against Ukraine by Russia. These measures have inflicted substantial costs on the Russian economy and their impact will further increase in the future. The sanctions aim at those who bear responsibility for the unlawful attack against Ukraine and not at the Russian civil society who has shown signs of protest against President Putin’s war. The G7 stand ready to increase this pressure.

Ministers committed to substantially increase and disburse humanitarian aid as the needs of the Ukrainian people grow daily due to Russia’s continued aggression. They ask others to join in this effort. A humanitarian push is urgently needed, for Ukraine and beyond, as this ruthless war will have massive consequences for food security and prices in many countries that depend on deliveries from Ukraine’s agricultural sector.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/g7-chair-s-statement-today-s-g7-call-17-march-2022

In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of the Group of Seven called on Russia to comply with the International Court of Justice’s order to stop its attack and withdraw its forces.

While the UN’s political chief called for an investigation of massive civilian casualties and the destruction of hundreds of residential buildings, schools, hospitals and other civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, and for those responsible to be held accountable.

Undersecretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “international humanitarian law is crystal clear” in prohibiting direct attacks on civilians in military operations and ensuring their protection.

Yet, she said, many of the daily attacks that are battering Ukrainian cities “are reportedly indiscriminate, resulting in civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure.”

It came as there were further reports of civilian deaths as Russian forces continued to pound cities across Ukraine.

In the northern city of Chernihiv, at least 53 people had been brought to morgues over the past 24 hours, killed amid heavy Russian air attacks and ground fire, the local governor, Viacheslav Chaus, told Ukrainian TV on Thursday.

Ukraine’s emergency services said a mother, a father and three of their children, including three-year-old twins, were killed when a Chernihiv hostel was shelled.

At least 21 people were killed when Russian artillery destroyed a school and a community centre in Merefa, near the north-east city of Kharkiv, according to mayor Veniamin Sitov.

While in eastern Ukraine, a municipal pool complex where pregnant women and women with children were taking shelter was also hit on Wednesday, according to Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the Donetsk regional administration.

Rescuers continued to search for survivors in the ruins of a theatre in Mariupol where hundreds of people were reported to be sheltering after it was ripped apart by a Russian air strike in Mariupol.

Prior to Wednesday’s attack, up to 1,000 men, women and children were thought to have taken shelter in the Drama Theatre’s basement seeking safety from the onslaught by Mr Putin’s forces.

Earlier this week, a satellite image of the building showed the Russian word for “children” written in giant letters at both ends of the building, in an apparent bid to protect it from the shelling.

In Kyiv, where residents have been huddling in homes and shelters, emergency authorities said a fire broke out in an apartment building hit by remnants of a downed Russian rocket, killing one person.

Firefighters evacuated 30 people from the top floors of the 16-storey building and put out the blaze.

Despite the sustained bombardment of cities Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has “largely stalled on all fronts,” British defence chiefs said on Thursday.

They stressed that Russian forces were making “minimal progress” on land sea or air and were continuing to “suffer heavy losses”.

As the conflict entered its fourth week, they also stressed that Mr Putin’s troops had failed to seize any major cities despite the heavy bombardment of Mariupol, Kharkiv and other cities which has destroyed whole districts, according to footage and reports.

An American man was killed in a Russian attack in Chernihiv, where he was seeking medical treatment for his partner. The death of Jim Hill, of Diggs, Idaho, was reported by his sister.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for more help for his country in a video address to German legislators, saying thousands of people have been killed, including 108 children.

He also referred to the dire situation in Mariupol, saying: “Everything is a target for them.”

World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the UN Security Council on Thursday that WHO has verified 43 attacks on hospitals and health facilities with 12 people killed and 34 injured.

In a virtual briefing, Tedros said “the disruption to services and supplies is posing an extreme risk to people with cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV and TB, which are among the leading causes of mortality in Ukraine.”

The WHO chief said displacement and overcrowding caused by people fleeing fighting are likely to increase the risks of diseases such as Covid, measles, pneumonia and polio.

One day after US President Joe Biden called Putin a “war criminal,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said American officials were evaluating and documenting potential war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine.

Mr Blinken said the intentional targeting of civilians would amount to a war crime and that there will be “massive consequences” for any such crimes that are confirmed.

In a joint statement on March 17, G7 foreign ministers warned that perpetrators of war crimes in Ukraine “will be held accountable.” The heads of diplomacy of this group chaired this year by Germany “welcomed the work of investigation and collection of evidence in progress, including by the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court” in Ukraine.

“Those who commit war crimes, including the indiscriminate use of weapons against civilians, will be held to account,” the German, French, Italian, American, Japanese, Canadian and Italian ministers stressed in this statement. .

The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), which is investigating allegations of war crimes in Ukraine, visited the country on March 16 and spoke by videoconference with Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky.

The prosecutor opened an investigation into the situation in Ukraine on March 3, after receiving the green light from more than 40 ICC states parties.

The ICC, which sits in The Hague, was created in 2002 to try individuals prosecuted in particular for war crimes, crimes against humanity or acts of genocide.

In addition, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), based like the ICC in The Hague and responsible for settling disputes between States, ordered on March 16 the immediate halt to the Russian offensive in Ukraine. The G7 ministers call on Russia « to comply » with this order from the ICJ, the highest UN court.

Russia, which claims to have intervened militarily to « demilitarize » and « denazify » Ukraine and to come to the aid of the self-proclaimed People’s Republics of Donetsk and Lugansk, rejected the decision on March 17.

France ready to support the ICJ

The judgments of the ICJ are binding and without appeal, but the court, which bases its conclusions mainly on treaties and conventions, has no means of enforcing them.

“Up to now, Russia has pretended to comply with international law. If it does not agree to follow up on this order, it will be outside international law in an obvious way and without any dispute”, however underlined a French diplomatic source.

France has said that it is ready for its part to « intervene » alongside Ukraine in the proceedings of the ICJ when the latter examines the merits of the Russian military intervention and the accusations of violations of international law by Moscow.

“This case also concerns our fundamental interests for the full respect of international law”, noted the spokesperson for French diplomacy, Anne-Claire Legendre.

Such state interventions, permitted by the statute of the ICJ, remain rare. According to a French diplomatic source, other G7 and European countries could join France in this process. « We will do it in a concerted way, » added the same source.

This examination of the merits of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine will take « at least two years », the same source said, according to AFP.

BERLIN (AP) – Foreign ministers from the Group of Seven leading economies are calling on Russia to comply with the International Court of Justice’s order to stop its attack on Ukraine and withdraw its military forces.

In a joint statement, the G-7′s top diplomats condemned what they described as “indiscriminate attacks on civilians” by Russian forces including the siege of Mariupol and other cities.

The G-7 said that “those responsible for war crimes, including indiscriminate use of weapons against civilians, will be held responsible” and welcomed work to investigate and gather evidence in this regard, including by the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court.
