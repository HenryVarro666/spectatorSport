Ukraine‚Äôs capital has also been under attack with constant artillery fire and first cruise missile attacks already recorded.

Explosions have been so far heard in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odesa, and Kramatorsk, while shelling in the Russian-backed separatist territories has been somewhat of a constant over the past days.

While reports initially said Russian troops had landed in Odessa, this was disputed by the Ukrainian military.

Information available so far indicates that an advance into Ukraine is coming from Crime, Belgorod and Belarus, in an operation that seems to have been designed to achieve objectives fast. Exactly what the objectives of the operation are remains to be seen.

Russian news outlet said Russian strikes are targeting military infrastructure, including air bases and defenses as well as naval bases.

After months of discussions that followed the buildup of Russian forces in Ukraine failed, Russia shifted to false flag operations in an attempt to justify an all-out attack against its neighbor. Russia‚Äôs president Vladimir Putin appears to have given up on that effort, deciding to launch the operation in the early morning hours of February 24.

It was 5 o'clock in the morning Kyiv time Putin started an unprovoked war against Ukraine, a war against Europe, a war against the whole world ‚Äî Ukraine's Emb. to UK (@UkrEmbLondon) February 24, 2022

Unconfirmed Reports coming in from Ukraine say that the Belarussian military was also involved in the invasion.

The attack comes a day after Putin announced that he had decided to ‚Äúconduct a special military operation‚Äù in connection with the situation in the Donbass.

‚ÄúI have decided to conduct a special military operation. Its goal is to protect people who have been subjected to harassment and genocide by the Kiev regime for eight years. And for this we will strive for the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine. As well as bringing to justice those who committed numerous bloody crimes against civilians, including citizens of the Russian Federation,‚Äù Putin said.

Several hours after the invasion started, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted that he had already talked to US president Joe Biden, German chancellor Olaf Scholz, UK prime minister Boris Jonson and European Union leaders, urging them to stop ‚ÄúPutin‚Äôs war against Ukraine and the world immediately!‚Äù

He also pledged for assistance close the airspace in Ukraine and ‚Äúforcing Russia into peace.‚Äù

24 Feb 2022 01.53 Andrew Roth Video footage indicates that Russian rockets have hit population centres in major Ukrainian cities despite claims by the Russian military that it is only targeting military infrastructure.

The rocket‚Äôs payload failed to explode on impact and it was left sticking out of the pavement in the city close to an Orthodox church. CIT, an open-source research group, confirmed that the video was shot in Kharkiv and that the tali section resembled a Smerch rocket.

Ukraine‚Äôs interior ministry adviser says shelling across Ukraine has killed one and wounded another in Brovary in the Kyiv region. Ukraine‚Äôs military added that two Russian tanks and several trucks in eastern Ukraine were seen while Russia is moving military equipment across from annexed Crimea.

Kyle Rodda of IG Markets in Melbourne said the spike could be part of a pincer movement of prices that force the US Federal Reserve and other central banks to rais einterest rates into the teeth of inflation. He said: A civil war would be both a huge growth shock to the European ‚Äì and global economy ‚Äì and inflation shock. That‚Äôs a dangerous mix, because the supply disruptions in commodity prices would drive costs higher, and exacerbate the inflation central banks are already struggling to contain. That means despite, this the Fed ‚Äì and others ‚Äì would be unable to buffet the shock, and would potentially have to tighten policy ‚Äì a very negative scenario for risk assets.

24 Feb 2022 01.31 UN security briefing held as war broke Julian Borger In case you missed the United Nations emergency security briefing earlier, the Guardian‚Äôs Julian Borger has compiled a rundown. Vladimir Putin delivered his speech while an emergency session of the UN security council was underway. It will go down as one of the most surreal sessions the chamber has ever witnessed, as the very war it was supposed to prevent, broke out while it was sitting. The secretary general, Antonio Guterres, was the first to speak, and at that time, Putin‚Äôs intentions were not entirely clear. But Guterres pointed to the reports of troops moving into position, and did something notable and rare for a UN secretary general: he publicly called out the head of a security council permanent member.

‚ÄúIf indeed an operation is being prepared, I have only one thing to say, from the bottom of my heart,‚Äù Guterres said. ‚ÄúPresident Putin - stop your troops from attacking Ukraine. Give peace a chance. Too many people have already died.‚Äù By the time it was time for the Russian permanent representative, Vasily Nebenzya, to speak, Putin had given his address, and there was no more mystery. Peace was not to be given a chance, after all. Nebenzya, who had spent weeks deriding western states for their ‚Äúhysterical‚Äù warnings of impending invasion, pivoted to argue it was not actually a war that was getting underway, but a ‚Äúspecial military operation‚Äù to protect the people of the Donbas. The Ukrainian ambassador, Sergiy Kyslytsya, had been waiting for his turn to speak while receiving constant updates from Kyiv. When his time came, he had to dispense with his prepared speech because, he said, ‚Äúmost of it is already useless‚Äù. Instead he held up a copy of the UN Charter, a small sky blue booklet, and read the clause that said UN membership was open to all peace-loving states which accept the obligations contained in the charter. ‚ÄúRussia is not able to carry out any of those obligations,‚Äù Kyslytsya declared.

He challenged Nebenzya to deny that Ukraine was under attack. ‚ÄúYou have a smartphone,‚Äù he said, taunting the Russian to check with his boss, the foreign minister, on what was really going on. ‚ÄúYou can call Lavrov right now. We can make a pause to let you go out and call him.‚Äù Nebenzya declined. ‚ÄúI have already said all I know at this point,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWaking up Minister Lavrov at this time is not something I plan to do.‚Äù An hour or so into the meeting, the multiplying reports of bombardment of Ukrainian cities had reached the chamber, and if the futility of the council‚Äôs calls for peace and dialogue had not been clear before, they were now agonisingly obvious.

Some ambassadors demanded to speak for a second time to express their sense of betrayal. ‚ÄúAt the exact time as we were gathered in the council seeking peace, Putin delivered a message of war in total disdain for the responsibility of this council,‚Äù the US permanent representative, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said. ‚ÄúThis is a grave emergency.‚Äù Her British counterpart, Barbara Woodward declared it ‚Äúa grave day for Ukraine and for the principles of the United Nations.‚Äù Kyslytsya himself was trembling with emotion. He stared at Nebenzya and demanded the Russian relinquish his duties as chair of the council. ‚ÄúThere is no purgatory for war criminals,‚Äù he warned him. ‚ÄúThey go straight to hell.‚Äù

At that point, Nebenzya quickly closed the meeting, claiming that Russia‚Äôs aggression was not directed at the Ukrainian people, but ‚Äúagainst the junta that is in power in Kiev‚Äù. Then he adjourned and left. A security council that had begun, just about, in peacetime, had broken up in a time of war, and perhaps at the start of a major conflict.

‚ÄúThis is a completely groundless, cynical invasion,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWe, the citizens of Ukraine, have been determining our own future since 1991,‚Äù he said in reference to the year of the Soviet Union‚Äôs collapse.

In a video posted on Telegram Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukrainian authorities are declaring martial law across the country, a state of submission to military authority in times of tension and conflict.

""We are declaring martial law across the country,"" he said.

He said that the Russian troops have delivered strikes against Ukrainian military infrastructure, right after Russian president Vladimir Putin announced the launching of a special military operation in Donbass.

""Russia delivered strikes against our military infrastructure and our border guards, border guard units. Explosions were heard in many cities of Ukraine,"" Zelensky said in the video.

The Ukrainian president also called on Germany, Poland, the UK, the US and the European Council in a tweet to aid him, close airspace, impose sanctions on Russia and ""stop Putin"" by forming an ""anti-Putin coalition.""

Furthermore, he said, ""A minute ago I had a conversation with President Biden. The US have already started uniting international support. Today each of you should keep calm. Stay at home if you can. We are working. The army is working. The whole sector of defense and security is working.""

A White House spokesman said Joe Biden ""just spoke with Zelensky"" and that details of the conversation will be announced later.

A special military op

The Russian president authorized a special military operation on Donbass this Thursday morning.

""Leading NATO countries pursue their own goal by fully supporting Ukraine's extreme Nazis and neo-Nazis, who, in turn, will never forgive the people of Crimea and Sevastopol for their free choice to reunify with Russia"", said Putin.

""They will, of course, go to Crimea, like to Donbass, the way they do it, to kill, like executioners from the bands of Ukrainian Nazi supporters of Hitler were killing innocent people during World War II"".

""The circumstances make us take decisive and immediate actions. The people's republics of Donbass asked Russia for assistance"", he added.

""In this regard, in accordance with Article 51, Part 7 of the UN Charter, with the sanction of the Federation Council and in pursuance of the friendship and mutual assistance treaties with the DPR and LPR, ratified by the Federal Assembly, I have decided to conduct a special military operation"".

He says that though war is a dirty business, NATO has not been acting out of morality, saying Russia cannot develop, feel safe, or exist with constant threats from Ukraine.",https://english.almayadeen.net/news/politics/ukraine-declares-nationwide-martial-law
