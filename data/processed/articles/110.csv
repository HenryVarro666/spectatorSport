Reach Her At', 'Tucker Reals']",,"A Fox News cameraman and a local producer working for the network were killed Monday in the same attack that left the network's correspondent Benjamin Hall injured as they reported near Ukraine's capital Kyiv, Fox News said confirmed Tuesday. The network said cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski and fixer Oleksandra ""Sasha"" Kuvshynova were killed when their vehicle ""was struck by incoming fire"" while in the field with Hall.

Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott said Zakrzewski, who was based in London, had ""covered nearly every international story for Fox News from Iraq to Afghanistan to Syria during his long tenure with us,"" adding that ""his passion and talent as a journalist were unmatched.""

""He was profoundly committed to telling the story and his bravery, professionalism and work ethic were renowned among journalists at every media outlet,"" Scott said.

""Pierre Zakrzewski was an absolute legend at this network and his loss is devastating,"" Fox News anchor Bill Hemmer said on the air Tuesday. He quoted Fox president Jay Wallace as saying that other staff ""always felt an extra sense of reassurance when they arrived on the scene, and they saw that Pierre was there.""

""He was a professional, he was a journalist, and he was a friend,"" said Hemmer. ""We here at the Fox News Channel want to offer our deepest condolences to Pierre's wife, Michelle, and his entire family. Pierre Zakrzewski was only 55 years old, and we miss him already.""

Just last year, the network honored Zakrzewski with a Fox News Media Spotlight Award, which are meant to recognize ""extraordinary employees who go above and beyond, inside and outside the workplace.""

Scott said the 24-year-old Kuvshynova was ""incredibly talented"" and had spent weeks helping the network's crews navigate Kyiv, gathering information and communicating with sources, ""operating around the clock to make sure the world knew what was happening in her country.""

""Our team in Ukraine tells me that Sasha had a passion for music, the arts and photography and was a joy to work with,"" Scott said. ""Several of our correspondents and producers spent long days with her reporting the news and got to know her personally, describing her as hard-working, funny, kind and brave. Her dream was to connect people around the world and tell their stories and she fulfilled that through her journalism.""

Fox News senior producer Yonat Friling tweeted a tribute to Kuvshynova, calling her a ""beautiful brave woman.""

""She loved music and she was funny and kind,"" Friling wrote. ""She was 24 years old. She worked with our team for the past month and did a brilliant job. May her memory be a blessing.""

Fox offered no update on the condition of Hall, their correspondent wounded in the same attack, but said he remained hospitalized on Tuesday.

Anton Gerashchenko, advisor to Ukraine's ministry of internal affairs, said Kuvshynova and Zakrzewski were killed by ""artillery fire from Russian-fascist forces,"" but the network has not attributed their death to a specific nation.

Gulnoza Said, the Committee to Protect Journalists' Europe and Central Asia program coordinator, said in a statement that she was ""deeply saddened"" by reports of Zakrzewski and Kuvshynova's deaths.

""Reporting on this war is a vital public service, and it has already claimed the lives of at least two other journalists in just a few weeks,"" she said. ""Ukrainian and Russian authorities must do their utmost to ensure safety of all journalists, and to thoroughly investigate attacks on the press.""

On Monday, the network confirmed that Hall ""was injured while newsgathering outside of Kyiv in Ukraine.""

Scott said in a Monday memo to employees that the network had a ""minimal level of details right now, but Ben is hospitalized and our teams on the ground are working to gather additional information as the situation quickly unfolds.""

News of the attack on the Fox crew came just a day after another American journalist, Brent Renaud, was shot and killed in Ukraine. The head of Kyiv's regional police force said Renaud was killed and another journalist was wounded by Russian forces in the town of Irpin, outside the capital of Kyiv, as they were traveling to film refugees.

Hall recently made headlines for rebuking Greg Gutfield, co-host of the Fox News political talk show ""The Five,"" after he said on-air that the reporting from Ukraine ""is a lot like other stories that we've gone through in the digital age in which an image is taken and then played over and over and over again to create some kind of emotional response out of you, because that makes a profit for news companies.""

""This is not the media trying to drum up some emotional response,"" Hall said. ""This is absolutely what's happening.""

""It is an absolute catastrophe,"" he added. ""And the people caught in the middle are the ones who are really suffering.""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pierre-zakrzewski-fox-news-killed-kyiv-ukraine-attack-benjamin-hall-wounded/

The network announced the death of Pierre Zakrzewski in a statement on Tuesday morning, before reports emerged Ukrainian journalist Oleksandra Kurshynova also died in the same attack.

“It is with great sadness and a heavy heart that we share the news this morning regarding our beloved cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski. Pierre was killed in Horenka, outside of Kyiv, Ukraine. Pierre was with Benjamin Hall newsgathering when their vehicle was struck by incoming fire,” the statement from Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott read.

“Pierre was a war zone photographer who covered nearly every international story for FOX News from Iraq to Afghanistan to Syria during his long tenure with us. His passion and talent as a journalist were unmatched. Based in London, Pierre had been working in Ukraine since February. His talents were fast and there wasn’t a role that he didn’t jump in to help with in the field - from photographer to engineer to editor to producer - and he did it all under immense pressure with tremendous skill.

“He was profoundly committed to telling the store and his bravery, professionalism and work ethic were renowned among journalists at every media outlet. He was wildly popular - everyone in the media industry who has covered a foreign story knew and respected Pierre.”

“We extend our deepest condolences to Pierre’s wife Michelle and family - please keep them all in your prayers. And please continue to pray for Benjamin Hall, who remains hospitalized in Ukraine. We will continue to be in touch with any further updates as needed.”

Ms Scott announced the hospitalisation of Mr Hall - a British-American journalist serving as the network’s State Department correspondent who has previously written for The Independent - in a memo to colleagues on Monday afternoon which did not reveal what had happened, the extent of his injuries or that Mr Zakrzewski was also injured in the same attack.

“Earlier today, our correspondent Benjamin Hall was injured while news gathering outside of Kyiv in Ukraine,” the Monday memo read. “We have a minimal level of details right now. Ben is hospitalised and our teams on the ground are working to gather additional information as the situation quickly unfolds.

“The safety of our entire team of journalists in Ukraine and the surrounding regions is our top priority and of the utmost importance. This is a stark reminder for all journalists who are putting their lives on the line every day to deliver the news from the war zone. We will update everyone as we know more. Please keep Ben and his family in your prayers.”

On Tuesday, Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence said Mr Hall had lost part of his leg.

The attack on Mr Hall and Mr Zakrzewski came just a day after American journalist Brett Renaud was shot and killed by Russian forces in Irpin while on an assignment for TIME magazine.

Mr Renaud was in a car on route to report on Ukrainian refugees trying to evacuate when the vehicle was ambushed by Vladimir Putin’s troops, according to Ukrainian officials. A second American journalist was also wounded and taken to hospital.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Joe Biden was thinking of Mr Hall when asked about the situation and the president’s previous pledge to “respond forcefully” if any Americans were harmed in Ukraine.

“Well, let me first say, your colleague, Benjamin Hall, I know there’s not final reports yet or we would wait for your news organization to confirm those but our thoughts, the president’s thoughts, our administration’s thoughts are with him, his family and all of you at Fox News as well,” she said in Monday’s press briefing.

She added that Mr Biden has been “leading the world” in putting “consequences” and “repercussions” in place in the form of crippling economic sanctions.

Tributes to Mr Zakrzewski poured in following the announcement of his death.

Fox News anchor Bill Hemmer shared the news live on air, calling Mr Zakrzewski “an absolute legend” whose loss is “devastating”.

“He was a professional, he was a journalist, and he was a friend,” Mr Hemmer said. “We here at the Fox News Channel want to offer our deepest condolences to Pierre’s wife, Michelle, and his entire family. Pierre Zakrzewski was only 55 years old, and we miss him already.”

Fellow anchor John Roberts tweeted: “I worked with Pierre many times around the world. He was an absolute treasure. Sending our most heartfelt prayers to Pierre‘s wife and family.”

“I don’t know what to say. Pierre was as good as they come. Selfless. Brave. Passionate. I’m so sorry this happened to you,” Fox News correspondent Trey Yingst tweeted.

As the Fox News community mourns the loss of Mr Zakrzewski and prays for Mr Hall’s recovery, some of the networks own hosts have come under fire for promotive misleading narratives about the Russia-Ukraine conflict that increasingly flatter the Kremlin’s version of events.

The most controversial host is Tucker Carlson, whose show is reliably among the most-watched pundit on cable news. Having often questioned before the conflict why anyone in the US should root for Ukraine (a well-established American ally) against Russia (an authoritarian adversary), he has lately helped introduce a conspiracy theory about US-funded and operated biolabs in Ukraine that have supposedly been developing bioweapons.

On Monday, Fox and Friends co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy further scrambled her network’s mixed messages about the conflict by raising the argument that the conflict is in fact the west’s fault.

The host asserted that the US “provoked” Russia by allowing the prospect of Ukraine becoming a member of Nato.

“They made very clear that there was a red line,” she said. “The red line was a neutrality for Ukraine, that they could not enter Nato.” (Ukraine is still not a Nato member.) “And in the end, if they get this peace agreement … that’s probably going to end up being the case anyway.”

Cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski, 55, and Ukrainian journalist Oleksandra Kuvshynova, 24, were with Fox News correspondent Benjamin Hall when their vehicle came under fire Monday in Horenka, a northwest suburb of Kyiv, Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott said in a statement.

“Today is a heartbreaking day for Fox News Media and for all journalists risking their lives to deliver the news,” Scott said.

Hall — who was “extremely close” to Zakrzewski, according to a colleague — was hurt in the attack and hospitalized.

Zakrzewski was a seasoned conflict photographer, having worked for Fox in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.

“He was profoundly committed to telling the story and his bravery, professionalism and work ethic were renowned among journalists at every media outlet,” Scott said.

Amy Kellogg, Fox’s senior foreign-affairs correspondent, told The Post on Tuesday, “Pierre was universally loved.”

She said she worked closely with Zakrzewski for about 15 years as a foreign correspondent.

“I was with him in a lot of hot spots. He was never a cowboy — he always took lots of precautions,” she said.

“He loved what he did more than anyone I’ve ever met.

“He was a knight, he was a gentleman, he was a prince” who “never got hardened” by what he saw in his work, Kellogg said.

She said her phone has been ringing “non-stop” since news broke of the photographer’s death, with both colleagues and subjects who Zakrzewski had photographed calling to express their sorrow.

“We’re all really devastated,” she said.

Kellogg added that Zakrzewski and Hall were “extremely close.”

Fox News in a statement only announced the death of Zakrzewski, an Irish citizen. Ukrainian officials and Fox News reporters confirmed that Kuvshynova was also killed in the attack.

“RIP Pierre and Sasha,” the Fox News Pentagon correspondent, Lucas Tomlinson, wrote on Twitter, using a diminutive name for the producer, and sharing a recent picture of the two, smiling with Hall.

Zakrzewski, 55, and Kuvshynova, 24, died “as a result of artillery shelling by Russian troops in the north-eastern part of the village of Gorenka”, Ukrainian website kp.ua said.

The news follows the death in Ukraine on Sunday of Brent Renaud, an American film-maker, who was shot in an area near where the Fox journalists were attacked.

Fox News had announced Hall’s injury on Monday, the reporter “was injured while newsgathering outside of Kyiv in Ukraine”.

Fox News’ chief executive, Suzanne Scott, said: “Pierre was killed in Horenka, outside of Kyiv, Ukraine. Pierre was with Benjamin Hall yesterday … when their vehicle was struck by incoming fire.

“Pierre was a war zone photographer who covered nearly every international story for Fox News from Iraq to Afghanistan to Syria during his long tenure with us.

It read: “She was incredibly talented and spent weeks working directly with our entire team, operating around the clock to make sure the world knew what was happening in her country.”

The statement described Kuvshynova as “hard-working, funny, kind and brave. Her dream was to connect people around the world and tell their stories, and she fulfilled that through her journalism.”

The statement added: “We held off on delivering this devastating news earlier today out of respect for her family whom we have been in touch with throughout.”

Yonat Friling, a Fox News field producer, tweeted: “In yesterday’s attack near Kyiv, we have lost a beautiful brave woman – Oleksandra Kuvshinova – Sasha.

Trey Yingst, a Fox News foreign correspondent, tweeted a picture with Zakrzewski and said: “I don’t know what to say. Pierre was as good as they come. Selfless. Brave. Passionate. I’m so sorry this happened to you.”

Hall, who is British-American, remained in hospital on Tuesday. Ukrainian authorities said he had “lost part of his leg”. Fox News said it was still trying to gather details of the attack on its team.

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

“We’ve got some very difficult news to share with you now,” Hemmer said. “Fox News cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski has died in Ukraine.”

Hemmer aired photos of Zakrzewski taken in Kyiv shortly before his death.

“Pierre Zakrzewski was an absolute legend at this network, and his loss is devastating,” Hemmer said. “He has been with us for years, covering wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria.”

“He was a professional, he was a journalist, and he was a friend,” Hemmer continued. “We here at the Fox News Channel want to offer our deepest condolences to Pierre’s wife, Michelle, and his entire family. Pierre Zakrzewski was only 55 years old, and we miss him already.”

Fox News reported on Monday that Hall, the network’s State Department correspondent who has been reporting from Ukraine alongside several other correspondents at the network, had been wounded and hospitalized. There has been little information on Hall’s circumstances.

“Earlier today our correspondent Benjamin Hall was injured while news gathering outside of Kyiv in Ukraine,” Suzanne Scott said in a statement Monday. “We have a minimal level of details right now.

Everyone in the industry knew of, admired and adored Fox News war zone photographer Pierre Zakrzewski. May he Rest In Peace. My thoughts and prayers to his wife and family. https://t.co/6OvL2BXzlb — Bryan Llenas (@BryanLlenas) March 15, 2022

As the Fox News community mourns the loss of Mr Zakrzewski and prays for Mr Hall’s recovery, some of the networks own hosts have come under fire for promotive misleading narratives about the Russia-Ukraine conflict that increasingly flatter the Kremlin’s version of events.

The most controversial host is Tucker Carlson, whose show is reliably among the most-watched pundit on cable news. Having often questioned before the conflict why anyone in the US should root for Ukraine (a well-established American ally) against Russia (an authoritarian adversary), he has lately helped introduce a conspiracy theory about US-funded and operated biolabs in Ukraine that have supposedly been developing bioweapons.

On Monday, Fox and Friends co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy further scrambled her network’s mixed messages about the conflict by raising the argument that the conflict is in fact the west’s fault.

The host asserted that the US “provoked” Russia by allowing the prospect of Ukraine becoming a member of Nato.

“They made very clear that there was a red line,” she said. “The red line was a neutrality for Ukraine, that they could not enter Nato.” (Ukraine is still not a Nato member.) “And in the end, if they get this peace agreement … that’s probably going to end up being the case anyway.”

The veteran journalist died when the vehicle he was travelling in came under fire - with the attack also injuring his co-worker, Benjamin Hall.

Fox News made the heartbreaking announcement of his passing in a memo to staff on Tuesday.

Mr Zakrzewski, who was based in London but was an Irish citizen, leaves behind his wife Michelle.

He was remembered fondly by fellow reporters as a passionate, talented journalist and an incredible person.

Floods of tributes have been paid to the popular cameraman, who just last December was honored by Fox News as an ""unsung hero"".

""We extend our deepest condolences to Pierre’s wife Michelle and family,"" said Fox News Media CEO Suzanne Scott. ""Please keep them all in your prayers. And please continue to pray for Benjamin Hall.""

Ukrainian journalist Oleksandra Kuvshynova is also reported to have been killed in the attack.

They are the latest members of the press who have lost their lives while trying to shine a light on the horrendous war being waged by Vladimir Putin on Ukraine.

Paying tribute to Mr Zakrzewski, Fox News president Jay Wallace said: ""Pierre was a constant in all of our international coverage.

""I, like countless others, always felt an extra sense of reassurance when arriving on the scene and seeing him with camera in hand.

""The legacy of his positive spirit, boundless energy and eye for the story will carry on.""

It comes as:

Mr Zakrzewski was killed while reporting with Mr Hall in Horenka, outside of Kyiv, Ukraine, as the capital awaits a major assault by the Russians.

He was a war correspondent who covered major conflicts including Iraq and Afghanistan.

""His passion and talent as a journalist were unmatched,"" Fox News said of the beloved cameraman.

Mr Zakrzewski had been stationed in Ukraine since February, working as a photographer, engineer, editor and producer.

By all accounts Pierre was an incredible photographer and great human Max Gorden

In a statement, Fox News said: ""His talents were vast and there wasn't a role that he didn't jump in to help with in the field - and he did it all under immense pressure with tremendous skill.

""He was profoundly committed to telling the story and his bravery, professionalism and work ethic, were renowned among journalists at every media outlet.""

Fox News weather reporter Max Gorden said: ""Gutting news. My thoughts are with Pierre Zakrzewski's family.

""By all accounts, Pierre was an incredible photographer and great human. Wishing safety for all the crews risking their lives in Ukraine.""

Fox News anchor John Roberts said: ""I worked with Pierre many times around the world. He was an absolute treasure.

""Sending our most heartfelt prayers to Pierre's wife and family.""

Fox News correspondent Trey Yingst wrote: ""I don't know what to say.

""Pierre was as good as they come. Selfless. Brave. Passionate. I'm so sorry this happened to you.""

And reporter Jennifer Griffin added: ""Such a fine man. Such a good friend. Such a fantastic war photographer and so much more.""

Micheál Martin, Taoiseach of Ireland, tweeted: ""Deeply disturbed and saddened by the killing of Irish citizen and journalist Pierre Zakrzewski and one of his colleagues today.

""My thoughts are with their families, friends and fellow journalists. We condemn this indiscriminate and immoral war by Russia on Ukraine.""

Tributes were also paid to Kuvshynova as someone who was ""vibrant and full of life"" - as well as being ""incredibly talented"" at her job.

Fox News Senior Field Producer Yonat Friling wrote on Twitter: ""In yesterday's attack near Kyiv, we have lost a beautiful brave woman.

""She loved music and she was funny and kind. She was 24 years old. She worked with our team for the past month and did a brilliant job.

""May her memory be a blessing.""

NBC's Atia Abawi wrote: ""She was a young Ukrainian journalist sharing the story of her country’s invasion.

""Our friends who worked with her said she was vibrant & full of life. I can’t even imagine the pain her parents are going through right now.""

Fox News journalist Lucas Tomlinson shared a picture of himself with Ms Kuvshynova and Mr Zakrzewski, writing: ""RIP Pierre and Sasha.""

He also revealed the final message sent to him by cameraman Pierre, saying: ""I will effort to get as much of this on TV to help Ukrainians in every way possible. Keep Smiling. Pierre.""

Mr Hall was left fighting for his life after being seriously injured in the attack when he was struck in both legs by shrapnel.

The married father-of-three was said to be in an ICU ward although Fox News told staff it had ""minimal level of details"" on the extent of his injuries.

He had previously described himself and Mr Zakrzewski as a ""two man band"".

Before joining Fox News, Hall was a war correspondent in the Middle East and Africa and is the author of Inside ISIS, The Brutal Rise Of A Terrorist Army.

He is a citizen of both the United States and the United Kingdom.

A memo from Fox News bosses said teams on the ground were working to find out more as their colleague battles for life.

""This is a stark reminder for all journalists who are putting their lives on the line every day to deliver the news from a war zone. We will update everyone as we know more. Please keep Ben and his family in your prayers,"" the outlet said.

The State Department Correspondents' Association also said in a statement that it was ""horrified to learn that our fellow correspondent Benjamin Hall was injured as he covered the Ukraine war"".

It said: ""We know Ben for his warmth, good humour and utmost professionalism.

""We wish Ben a quick recovery and call for utmost efforts to protect journalists who are providing an invaluable service through their coverage in Ukraine.""

White House press secretary Jen Psaki yesterday offered her sympathies to Hall at a press conference attended by his colleagues.

She said: ""Our thoughts, the president's thoughts, our administration's thoughts are with him, his family and all of you at Fox News.""

It came after American journalist Brent Renaud - who previously contributed to the New York Times - was gunned down by Vladimir Putin's troops while travelling in a car in Irpin.

Another reporter Juan Arredondo, Mr Renaud's colleague, was also treated at a hospital in Kyiv after being injured in the attack.

""We crossed the first bridge in Irpin. We were going to film other refugees leaving and we got into a car, someone offered to take us to the other bridge,"" he said.

""We crossed the checkpoint and they started shooting at us. So the driver turned around and they kept shooting.""

Andrey Nebitov, the head of the Kyiv region police, said the 51-year-old filmmaker ""paid his life"" for reporting on the invasion.

""A world-renowned media correspondent was shot in Irpin today,"" he said.

""Of course, the profession of a journalist is a risk, but US citizen Brent Renaud paid his life for trying to highlight the aggressor's ingenuity, cruelty and ruthlessness.""

His death came after the killing of two Ukrainian journalists, Viktor Dudar and Evgeny Sakun.

Reporters have been putting themselves in danger to bring the news about the atrocities being committed in Ukraine.

Thousands of civilians - men, women and children - have been killed in the barbarous strikes launched by Putin.

Last week, CBS viewers saw the terrifying moment correspondent Charlie D'Agata had to dive for cover as a huge bomb exploded behind him.

And two journalists from Sky News were shot in an ambush by Russian soldiers in Bucha.

The brutal war continues - with no signs so far of slowing down despite multiple rounds of peace talks.",https://www.the-sun.com/news/4891549/fox-news-cameraman-pierre-zakrzewski-killed-ukraine/
