The Russians keep demonstrating serious violations of international conventions; the same war crime pattern was used in the Central African Republic and Libya.

Russian troops shoot civilians leaving Donbass. For example, using BM-21 Grad MLRS and Smerch multiple launch rocket systems they opened fire on the buses running to the town. As the result civilians got injures.

The Chernobyl nuclear power plant, being in an emergency since 1986, was captured by Russian strike groups with heavy weaponry used. Due to the rise of contaminated groundwater the level of radioactive ground radiation increased.

During shelling from MLRS in Vorzel, Kyiv region, Russian invaders damaged the orphanage with 50 children inside. In Vrubivka, Luhansk region, the 12th Battalion of the 2nd Brigade (Russia) also fired at a school.

Similarly, by using Uragan MLRS Russian troops attacked a kindergarten in Okhtyrka. Several people were killed.

In this case, Russia duplicates the residential infrastructure strike tactics used in Syria. The infrastructure is shot from the Russian city of Belgorod.

Like the Wagner mercenaries in Libya, Russian saboteurs from among the regular Russian armed forces leave children’s toys and phones stuffed with explosives in Odessa region (Ukraine). Such operations are referred to acts of terrorism carried out by regular Russian army in Ukraine. These facts give all reasons to label this country as a terrorism sponsoring state.",https://lansinginstitute.org/2022/02/25/facts-proving-continued-russia-committed-war-crimes-in-ukraine/

The situation in the capital of Ukraine is heating up during the day. The city continues to resist, according to Defense Minister Alexei Reznikov, the defense fighters have already received 18,000 machine guns. With an appeal to come to the Troop and the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Ministry of Defense appealed to “everyone who can hold a weapon.”

Be always up to date with the Fast Focus telegram channel.

By the middle of the day, there were reports that the forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were entering the capital. In this regard, the Ministry of Internal Affairs appealed to the people of Kiev with a request not to remove military equipment and not to disclose its location.

In parallel, the Kiev authorities asked the citizens not to go out without special need. The danger is not only shelling, but also Russian equipment on the streets of Kyiv. So, a video has spread on social networks, where the Strela-10 combat vehicle runs into a car with a person inside. The ownership of the car is unclear, but commentators insist that the equipment is Russian.

Shelling and street fighting. Several DRGs were neutralized in Kyiv

On the morning of February 25, a Russian “Caliber” was shot down over residential areas of Kyiv – a cruise missile did not reach a military target and fell on a residential building. Three people were injured, one in serious condition.

Prosecutor General of Ukraine Irina Venediktova qualified the shelling of Kyiv as terrorist attacks. Near Kiev, according to her information, an orphanage in Vorzel suffered from shelling – fortunately, there were no victims, the children and staff of the institution were in another room at the time the shell arrived. As the prosecutor general clarifies, “children from the orphanage have not been evacuated, there are no bomb shelters or basements on the territory of the orphanage.”

From Vorzel to Kyiv, 25 km, to Gostomel – 8. According to local residents, the village was bombed by aircraft.

Shooting in the city

Shelling and skirmishes were reported several times during the day, in particular, new buildings in the area of ​​​​the central registry office, in the area of ​​u200bu200bthe Varshavsky residential complex, were under fire, there is information about battles in the Bolshaya Okrugnaya area on the highway from Bucha and in the Obolon region.

Aleksey Arestovich, adviser to the head of the President’s Office, in a commentary to UNIAN, said that the enemy DRGs that were in Kyiv were destroyed – not all, but those that showed themselves. “There is such a practice when enemy troops approach the capital, secret DRGs, who have been sitting there for a couple of months, come out to create a commotion and put psychological pressure on the population,” Arestovich explained. According to him, in Kyiv, such mothballed groups were opened in Obolon, Lukyanovka and Pechersk – there “there was a short shooting, which immediately stopped … They were quickly crushed. The SBU is working professionally, the National Guard is working,” Arestovich specified. Nevertheless, the adviser to the OP does not rule out that there are still hidden DRGs in Kyiv.

The Telegram channel “VIO 18+” posted a video, which allegedly filmed the death of civilians in Kyiv, who were allegedly shot by saboteurs on the street. Kirillovskaya.

The place where, according to the channel, the execution took place:

The same channel reported on the liquidation of a sabotage group on Obolon by the AFU fighters: the video shows the moment of shooting down a Ural car with a Zu-23, which, as expected, was used by disguised saboteurs.

Deputy Defense Minister Anna Malyar reported on the destruction of the Russian DRG. According to her, a group of Russian military seized two vehicles of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, dressed in the uniform of Ukrainian fighters and at high speed tried to break into the center of Kyiv from Obolon. Following them to Kyiv, according to the deputy minister, a convoy of Russian military trucks was moving.

Gostomel Airport: Armed Forces are preparing a counterattack

The Gostomel airfield near Kiev remains a stumbling block between the Russian landing force, to which tank columns broke through, and the forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It is possible that the Ukrainian military is preparing a counterattack, since Gostomel is a key point for blocking Kyiv from the western side. At the very least, the Russian propaganda channel RT, referring to the RF Ministry of Defense, states that they are preparing to fire at Gostomel from the Grad MLRS installed in Kyiv on Shevchenko Square.

According to a report by the Russian Defense Ministry published online, more than 200 Russian helicopters were involved in the operation to seize the airport in Gostomel. “The success of the landing was ensured by the suppression of the entire air defense system in the landing area, the complete isolation of the combat area from the air and the active conduct of electronic warfare.”

The situation on the tracks

Leaving the city is possible, but not easy: according to eyewitnesses, a huge traffic jam gathered at the exit from Kyiv towards Zhytomyr, some drivers tried to get through the oncoming lane. Gas stations are closed, people borrow gas from each other. A checkpoint was set up on the Obukhovskaya highway, which also makes traffic difficult – as a result, the traffic jam there stretched for 10 km.

What the city authorities say: “Kyiv has entered the phase of defense”

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said at an emergency briefing on February 25 that the city had entered a phase of defense. The situation is difficult, but it is necessary to believe and support the Armed Forces of Ukraine, providing all possible assistance. So, Kiev residents are asked to report to the police about marks and identification marks that are made on roads and walls of buildings in city blocks (in order to make adjustments later on them), but if possible, stock up on food, water and warm clothes and stay at home. “You can only leave the shelter or the house if the siren stops,” Klitschko stressed.

The Kyiv City State Administration asks the owners of webcams to temporarily stop broadcasting in real time: “Do not help the enemy get information about our military,” they ask the Ukrainians.

Kyiv is stocking up on blood for the wounded

The city blood center in the capital is now working around the clock, according to the Kyiv City State Administration. Donor blood collection points will be open from 8:00 to 18:00. In the evening and during the night shift, the center’s specialists will process blood and its components.

“The decision was made to guarantee the maintenance of a sufficient supply of blood and the uninterrupted supply of medical institutions with it,” the Kyiv City State Administration said.

Addresses of blood collection points in Kyiv:

General situation

The President of Ukraine, meanwhile, announced what sanctions Ukraine expects from the West against Russia: visa cancellation for Russian citizens, disconnection from SWIFT, recall of ambassadors and complete isolation of the country, oil embargo, closed skies. “Today, all this should be on the table, since we are talking about a threat to the whole of Europe,” Zelensky said, addressing Western leaders.",https://www.archyworldys.com/shooting-in-residential-areas-awakened-drgs-and-the-struggle-for-gostomel/

Natt til fredag fortsatte missil- og luftangrepene mot ukrainske kommandoposter, etterretningsstasjoner og luftforsvar. Samtidig fortsetter fremrykkingen mot Kyiv fra nord, øst og sør.

– Bremser russisk framrykning

Oberstløytnant Palle Ydstebø, sjef for seksjon for landmakt ved krigsskolen, sier at det likevel ser ut til at ukrainerne klarer å holde stand, og bremser de russiske fremstøtene.

Torsdag kveld meldte ukrainske myndigheter at de har nedkjempet en russisk luftbåren bataljon ved den strategisk viktige militærflyplassen i Hostomel, som ligger om lag 25 kilometer nordvest for Kyiv. Flyplassen ble gjenerobret etter at Russland inntok flyplassen tidligere på dagen.

– Biter fra seg

– Det viser at ukrainerne biter av seg, og viser kampkraft når de får møte motstanderen på likefot, sier Ydstebø.

Ukrainske myndigheter melder at Russland har gått på store tap, og at russiske 800 soldater har mistet livet i Hostomel alene.

Ydstebø forklarer at flyplassen har en viktig strategisk betydning, da Russland håpet å kunne bruke flyplassen til å fly inn forsterkninger og tyngre materiell.

– Flyplassen kunne brukes som et utgangspunkt for et raskt kupp mot hovedstaden, sier han.

Lydklipp av ukrainske soldaters siste ord

Ukrainas president Volodymyr Zelenskyj sier at 13 soldater ble drept da Russland erobret en viktig øy i Svartehavet.

Zelenskyj opplyste torsdag kveld om at øya Zmiinyi, også kjent som Slangeøya, er blitt er erobret av russiske styrker. Uttalelsen ble først meldt av CNN. Øya ligger sør for Odesa, og er en av få ukrainske øyer.

Presidenten sier at alle de 13 ukrainske soldatene som var stasjonert på øya, er drept.

– Alle grensesoldatene døde heroisk, uten å gi opp. De blir tildelt ordenen «Helt av Ukraina» posthumt, sier Zelenskyj.

Soldatene ble drept da et russisk krigsskip åpnet ild, ifølge nyhetsbyrået DPA.

Flere medier har publisert et lydklipp som er mye delt i sosiale medier. Det skal gjengi kommunikasjonen mellom marinefartøyet og de ukrainske soldatene.

– Dette er et russisk marinefartøy. Jeg oppfordrer dere til å legge ned våpnene og overgi dere for å unngå blodsutgytelser og unødvendige ofre. Hvis ikke blir dere bombet, sier marinefartøyet over radioen.

– Dra til helvete, svarte da en ukrainsk soldat.

Knipetangsmanøver

– Det overordnete bildet er at russerne forsøker å nå frem til Kyiv i en knipetangsmanøver, forklarer Palle Ydstebø.

De russiske invasjonsstyrkene har i løpet av natten fortsatt fremrykkingen fra Hviterussland i nord, langs begge sider av elven Dnipro. I morgentime fredag mente Ydstebø å se tegn til at fremrykningen har bremset ned, og at denne frontlinjen står om lag 70–90 kilometer inn i landet.

Samtidig har russerne brutt gjennom i Sumy og Kharkiv i nordøst. Derfra har mekaniserte enheter presset vestover, og da Vårt Land snakket med Ydstebø fredag formiddag, anslo han at de hadde kommet rundt 100 kilometer inn i landet. Her har de russiske styrkene beleiret byen Konotop.

Torsdag kveld var det i Sør-Ukraina fremrykningen hadde kommet lengst. Russiske styrker inntok da byen Kherson, og krysset derfra Dnipro mot nord. Målet for denne manøveren er å nå fram til havnebyen Odesa. Ifølge Ydstebø har det nå kommet rapporter om at ukrainske styrker har lyktes i å presse dette fremstøtet tilbake.

Russland forsøker også å få kontroll over byene Melitopol og Mariupol, som ligger nord-øst for Krim-halvøya, langs Azov-kysten. Målet med dette er å sikre en landbro mellom den russiskokkuperte Krym-halvøya og de opprørskontrollerte områdene i Donetsk, lengst øst i Ukraina.

Kampene om Kyiv blir viktigst

Ydstebø mener at det mest avgjørende nå blir hvordan det går med kampene nord for Kiyv. Her har det kommet rapporter om at russiske styrker har ikledd seg ukrainske uniformer, i et forsøk på å infiltrere hovedstaden.

– Dersom dette stemmer er det definitivt et grovt brudd på folkeretten, sier han.

Oppsummert sier oberstløytnanten at mye kan peke mot at Russland har undervurdert den ukrainske motstanden. Han understreker også at alle foreløpige rapporter må regnes som usikre.
