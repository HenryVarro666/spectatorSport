BEIJING, March 18 (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping told his U.S. counterpart Joe Biden on Friday that conflicts and confrontations such as the events unfolding in Ukraine are in the interests of no-one, according to Chinese state media.

State-to-state relations cannot advance to the stage of confrontation, and conflicts and confrontations are not in the interests of anyone, Xi told Biden on a video call.

BEIJING -- Chinese President Xi Jinping had a video call with US President Joe Biden at the request of the latter on Friday. The two Presidents had a candid and in-depth exchange of views on China-US relations, the situation in Ukraine, and other issues of mutual interest.

President Biden said that 50 years ago, the United States and China made the important choice of issuing the Shanghai Communique. Fifty years on, the US-China relationship has once again come to a critical time. How this relationship develops will shape the world in the 21st century.

He reiterated that the US does not seek a new Cold War with China; it does not aim to change China's system; the revitalization of its alliances is not targeted at China; the US does not support ""Taiwan independence""; and it has no intention to seek a conflict with China.

The US is ready to have candid dialogue and closer cooperation with China, stay committed to the one-China policy, and effectively manage competition and disagreements to ensure the steady growth of the relationship, said President Biden.

He also expressed readiness to stay in close touch with President Xi to set the direction for the US-China relationship.

Noting the international landscape has experienced new major developments since their first virtual meeting last November, Xi said the prevailing trend of peace and development is facing serious challenges, and the world is neither tranquil nor stable.

As permanent members of the UN Security Council and the world's two leading economies, China and the US must not only guide their relations forward along the right track, but also shoulder their share of international responsibilities and work for world peace and tranquility, Xi said.

Xi stressed that he and President Biden share the view that China and the US need to respect each other, coexist in peace and avoid confrontation, and that the two sides should increase communication and dialogue at all levels and in all fields.

President Biden has just reiterated that the US does not seek to have a new Cold War with China, to change China's system, or to revitalize alliances against China, and that the US does not support ""Taiwan independence"" or intend to seek a conflict with China, Xi said. ""I take these remarks very seriously.""

Xi pointed out the China-US relationship, instead of getting out of the predicament created by the previous US administration, has encountered a growing number of challenges. What's worth noting in particular is that some people in the US have sent a wrong signal to ""Taiwan independence"" forces, Xi said, adding ""this is very dangerous.""

Mishandling of the Taiwan question will have a disruptive impact on the bilateral ties, said Xi. ""China hopes that the US will give due attention to this issue.""

The direct cause for the current situation in the China-US relationship is that some people on the US side have not followed through on the important common understanding reached by the two Presidents and have not acted on President Biden's positive statements. The US has misperceived and miscalculated China's strategic intention, Xi said.

Xi underscored that there have been and will continue to be differences between China and the US ""What matters is to keep such differences under control. A steadily growing relationship is in the interest of both sides,"" he added.

The two sides exchanged views on the situation in Ukraine.

President Biden expounded on the US position, and expressed readiness for communication with China to prevent the situation from exacerbating.

""China does not want to see the situation in Ukraine to come to this. China stands for peace and opposes war. This is embedded in China's history and culture,"" Xi said.

China makes a conclusion independently based on the merits of each matter, advocates upholding international law and universally recognized norms governing international relations, and adheres to the UN Charter and promotes the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. These are the major principles that underpin China's approach to the Ukraine crisis, Xi said.

Noting that China has put forward a six-point initiative on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, Xi said China is ready to provide further humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and other affected countries.

""All sides need to jointly support Russia and Ukraine in having dialogue and negotiation that will produce results and lead to peace,"" Xi said, adding that the US and NATO should also have dialogue with Russia to address the crux of the Ukraine crisis and ease the security concerns of both Russia and Ukraine.

Xi stressed that with the need to fight COVID-19 on the one hand and protect the economy and people's livelihood on the other, things are already very difficult for countries around the world.

""As leaders of major countries, we need to think about how to properly address global hotspot issues and, more importantly, keep in mind global stability and the work and life of billions of people,"" Xi said.

Sweeping and indiscriminate sanctions would only make the people suffer. If further escalated, they could trigger serious crises in global economy and trade, finance, energy, food, and industrial and supply chains, crippling the already languishing world economy and causing irrevocable losses, Xi added.

""The more complex the situation, the greater the need to remain cool-headed and rational,"" Xi said, adding that whatever the circumstances, there is always a need for political courage to create space for peace and leave room for political settlement.

""As two Chinese sayings go, 'It takes two hands to clap.' 'He who tied the bell to the tiger must take it off.' It is imperative that the parties involved demonstrate political will and find a proper settlement in view of both immediate and long-term needs,"" Xi said.

Xi said other parties can and should create conditions to that end. The pressing priority is to keep the dialogue and negotiation going, avoid civilian casualties, prevent a humanitarian crisis, and cease hostilities as soon as possible.

He said an enduring solution would be for major countries to respect each other, reject the Cold War mentality, refrain from bloc confrontation, and build step by step a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture for the region and for the world.

""China has been doing its best for peace and will continue to play a constructive role,"" Xi said.

Agreeing that the video call is constructive, the two Presidents directed their teams to promptly follow up and take concrete actions to put China-US relations back on the track of steady development, and make respective efforts for the proper settlement of the Ukraine crisis.

Amid worsening Russia-Ukraine conflict, Biden spoke with Xi in a conversation that lasted nearly two hours.

""Conflicts and confrontations are not in anyone's interests. Peace and security are the values that the international community should cherish most of all,"" Xi was quoted as saying by Chinese state media.

In a secured video call, Xi told Biden that the United States and China need to make efforts to maintain global peace.

""The crisis in Ukraine is not what we would like to see,"" Xi added.

In a press statement, the White House said that this call was part of Washington's ongoing efforts to maintain open lines of communication between the United States and China.

Washington: Key figures for a war half a world away, President Joe Biden and China's Xi Jinping spoke for nearly two hours on Friday as the White House looked to deter Beijing from providing military or economic assistance for Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

China's foreign ministry was the first to issue a readout of the video conversation, deploring ""conflict and confrontation"" as ""not in anyone's interest,"" without assigning any blame to Russia.

Ahead of the call, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden would question Xi about Beijing's ""rhetorical support"" of Putin and an ""absence of denunciation"" of Russia's invasion.

Foreign ministry spokesman Chunying Hua pushed back, calling Biden's administration's suggestions that China risks falling on the wrong side of history in the conflict ""overbearing.""

Planning for the call had been in the works since Biden and Xi held a virtual summit in November, but differences between Washington and Beijing over Russian President Vladimir Putin's prosecution of his three-week-old war against Ukraine were expected to be at the center of the call.

China on Friday also sought to highlight its calls for negotiations and donations of humanitarian aid, while accusing the US of provoking Russia and fueling the conflict by shipping arms to Ukraine.

In an attempt to show international support for China's position, state broadcaster CCTV said Xi discussed Ukraine in phone calls with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, adding that the leaders' views were ""extremely close.""

The US-China relationship, long fraught, has only become more strained since the start of Biden's presidency. Biden has repeatedly criticised China for military provocations against Taiwan, human rights abuses against ethnic minorities and efforts to squelch pro-democracy advocates in Hong Kong.

But the relationship may have reached a new low with the Russian invasion.

In the days after Putin deployed Russian forces in Ukraine, Xi's government tried to distance itself from Russia's offensive but avoided criticizing Moscow. At other moments, Beijing's actions have been provocative and have included amplifying unverified Russian claims that Ukraine ran chemical and biological weapons labs with U.S. support.

Earlier this week, the US informed Asian and European allies that American intelligence had determined that China had signaled to Russia that it would be willing to provide both military support for the campaign in Ukraine and financial backing to help stave off the impact of severe sanctions imposed by the West.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday reiterated that the Biden administration remains concerned that China is considering providing military equipment to Russia. He said Biden would make clear to Xi ""that China will bear responsibility for any actions it takes to support Russia's aggression, and we will not hesitate to impose costs.""

The White House says China has been sending mixed messages about its support for Russia. There were initial signs that Chinese state owned banks were pulling back from financing Russian activities, according to a senior Biden administration official who insisted on anonymity to discuss internal analyses. But there have also been public comments by Chinese officials who expressed support for Russia being a strategic partner.

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan and senior Chinese foreign policy adviser Yang Jiechi met in Rome earlier this week for an intense, seven-hour talk about the Russian invasion and other issues.

Ahead of the Rome talks, Sullivan said the US wouldn't abide China or any other country helping Russia work around economy-jarring sanctions inflicted by the U.S. and other allies since the 24 February invasion.

Sullivan also said the administration determined China knew that Putin ""was planning something"" before the invasion of Ukraine, but the Chinese government ""may not have understood the full extent"" of what Putin had in mind.

Xi and Putin met in early February, weeks before the invasion, with the Russian leader traveling to Beijing for the start of the Winter Olympics. During Putin's visit, the two leaders issued a 5,000-word statement declaring limitless ""friendship.""

Beijing's leadership would like to be supportive of Russia but also recognizes how badly the Russian military action is going as an overmatched Ukrainian military has put up stiff resistance, according to a Western official familiar with current intelligence assessments.

The official, who was not authorised to comment and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Beijing is weighing the potential ""reputational blowback"" of being associated with the Russian camp. The Chinese response to Russia's request for help ""is in the process of being formulated,"" the official added.

Though seen as siding with Russia, China has also reached out to Ukraine, with its ambassador to the country on Monday quoted as saying: ""China is a friendly country for the Ukrainian people. As an ambassador, I can responsibly say that China will forever be a good force for Ukraine, both economically and politically.""

""We have seen how great the unity of the Ukrainian people is, and that means its strength,"" Fan Xianrong was quoted by Ukraine's state news service Ukrinform as telling regional authorities in the western city of Lviv, where the Chinese embassy has relocated to.

In a reminder of China's threat to assert its claim to Taiwan by force, the Chinese aircraft carrier Shandong sailed through the Taiwan Strait on Friday, just hours before the Biden-Xi call, Taiwan's defense ministry said.

Any conflict over the self-governing island democracy stands to involve the US, which is legally obligated to ensure Taiwan can defend itself and treats threats to the island as matters of ""grave concern.""

""The national army's intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems are in complete possession of the movements of Chinese ships in the sea and planes in the airspace around the Taiwan Strait to safeguard national security,"" the ministry said in a statement.

Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said he had no details about the ship's passage through the strait, but added that ""I believe the carrier has its routine training schedule, and it should not be linked with the communication between Chinese and American leaders.""

State-to-state relations cannot advance to the stage of confrontation, and conflicts and confrontations are not in the interests of anyone, Xi told Biden on a video call.

""The Ukraine crisis is something that we don't want to see,"" said Xi.

Xi said China and the United States must guide bilateral relations along the right track, and both sides should also shoulder due international responsibilities and make efforts for world peace.

The call, their first since a video summit in November, will be a chance for Biden to try and persuade Xi to give up any idea of bailing out Russia from the effects of Western sanctions or even sending military assistance for Russia's onslaught against neighbouring Ukraine, the White House said earlier in the day.

Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman told CNN that China should get off the fence and join forces with the West against President Vladimir Putin.

China should ""understand that their future is with the United States, with Europe, with other developed and developing countries around the world. Their future is not to stand with Vladimir Putin,"" she said.

Biden has successfully marshalled a tight Western alliance against Russia, while giving military support to Ukrainian forces.

But Beijing has refused to condemn its fellow ally, and Washington fears the Chinese could switch to full financial and military support for Russia, transforming an already explosive transatlantic standoff into a global dispute.

If that happened, not only could Beijing potentially help Putin weather sanctions and continue his war, but Western governments would face the painful decision of how to strike back at the world's second biggest economy, likely prompting turmoil on international markets.

The White House was tight-lipped on whether Biden will threaten China with economic sanctions during his call, but some sort of response is on the table.

Biden ""will make clear that China will bear responsibility for any actions it takes to support Russia's aggression and we will not hesitate to impose costs,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.

China should use ""whatever leverage they have to compel Moscow to end this war,"" the top US diplomat urged, but said he was ""concerned that they're considering directly assisting Russia with military assistance.""

The Biden-Xi call came after US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Yang Jiechi, the Chinese Communist Party's chief diplomat, held what the White House called a ""substantial"" seven-hour meeting in Rome this week.

Xi and Putin symbolically sealed their close partnership when they met at the February Winter Olympics in Beijing -- just before Putin launched his onslaught on Ukraine.

Since then, Beijing has stood out by refusing to join international outcry over the attack, while taking the Russian line in blaming the United States and Nato for European tensions. But China has also tried to remain somewhat ambiguous, declaring support for Ukraine's sovereignty.

Brookings Institution fellow Ryan Hass, a former adviser on China to president Barack Obama, said Beijing has to sort through its clashing priorities.

Despite the coziness with Moscow, China -- the world's biggest exporter -- is tightly bound to the US and other Western economies. It also wants to play a leadership role in the world.

""China's and Russia's interests are not in alignment. Putin is an arsonist of the international system and President Xi sees himself as an architect for remaking and improving the international system,"" Hass said.

""President Xi is trying to balance competing priorities. He really places a lot of value in China's partnership with Russia but at the same time he does not want to undermine China's relations in the West."" -- Reuters/AFP",https://www.omanobserver.om/article/1116339/world/americas/xi-tells-biden-conflict-in-no-ones-interest

By Trevor Hunnicutt and Steve Holland

WASHINGTON, March 18 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke on a video call on Friday about Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Chinese media said Xi underlined that such conflicts are in no-one's interests

Biden was expected to tell the Chinese leader that Beijing would pay a steep price if it supports the invasion, a warning that comes at a time of deepening acrimony between the two nations.

The call lasted just under two hours, the White House said.

Earlier, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman told MSNBC that Xi should tell Russian President Vladimir Putin ""to end this war of choice, this war of carnage"" in Ukraine.

""China needs to stand on the right side of history. It needs to ensure that it does not backfill, financially or in any other way, sanctions that have been imposed on Russia,"" she told CNN.

Xi told Biden that conflicts and confrontations such as the events in Ukraine are in the interests of no one, according to Chinese state media.

State-to-state relations cannot advance to the stage of confrontation, and conflicts and confrontations are not in the interests of anyone, Xi said.

""The Ukraine crisis is something that we don't want to see,"" Xi was quoted as saying. Chinese state media said the call had been requested by the U.S. side.

Before the call, a Chinese aircraft carrier sailed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait on Friday. The USS Ralph Johnson, an Arleigh Burke guided missile destroyer, shadowed the carrier at least partly on its route.

China claims democratically ruled Taiwan as its own, and has over the past two years stepped up its military activity near the island to assert its sovereignty claims, alarming Taipei and Washington.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Biden would make clear to Xi that China will bear responsibility if it supported Russia's ""aggression"" and that Washington ""will not hesitate to impose costs."" Russia says it is carrying out a special military operation in Ukraine.

Story continues

Speaking on Thursday, Blinken said the Biden administration was concerned China was considering directly assisting Russia with military equipment for use in Ukraine, something Beijing has denied.

Washington is also concerned that China could help Russia circumvent Western economic sanctions.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine, now in its fourth week, has killed hundreds of civilians, reduced city areas to rubble and sparked a humanitarian crisis as millions flee the country.

Russia fired missiles at an airport near Lviv on Friday, a city where hundreds of thousands had sought refuge far from Ukraine's battlefields, as Moscow tries to regain the initiative in its stalled campaign against Ukraine.

Ukraine has added a new front in a U.S.-Chinese relationship already at its worst level in decades, further deflating Biden's initial hopes of easing a wide range of disputes by using a personal connection with Xi that predates his term in office.

The United States and China are the world's two largest economies and Washington has been anxious to avoid a new ""Cold War"" between them, seeking instead to define the relationship as one of competitive coexistence.

However, China's ""no-limits"" strategic partnership with Russia announced last month and its stance on Ukraine has called that into question.

China has refused to condemn Russia's action in Ukraine or call it an invasion, and it has censored online content in China that is pro-West or unfavorable to Russia.

Beijing, while saying it recognizes Ukraine's sovereignty, has also said Russia has legitimate security concerns that should be addressed. It has urged a diplomatic solution to the conflict.

While Biden's administration has threatened counter-measures if China helps Russia's Ukraine effort, it and its allies have not yet decided precisely what steps they might take, according to a person involved in the conversations.

Targeting Beijing with the sort of extensive economic sanctions imposed on Russia would have potentially dire consequences for the United States and the world, given that China is the world's second-largest economy and the largest exporter.

Analysts say China is unlikely to turn its back on Russia over the conflict in Ukraine, but its diplomatic efforts to appear even-handed are becoming harder to maintain and closeness with Moscow could cost Beijing goodwill in many world capitals.

However, Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry, scorned the idea of Beijing being discomfited and instead lashed out against Western counties, accusing them of stoking fears in countries like Russia.

""Those who really feel uncomfortable are those countries that think they can lord it over the world after winning the Cold War, those that keep driving NATO's eastward expansion five times in disregard of other countries' security concerns, those that wage wars across the globe while accusing other countries of being belligerent,"" Zhao said on Thursday.

China’s ambassador to the United States, Qin Gang, has said China would have worked to prevent the war if it had known about the ""imminent crisis."" However, according to a New York Times report in February, Washington shared intelligence with senior Chinese officials on Russia’s troop build up in an effort to convince Beijing to intervene with Putin, but were rebuffed.

A seven-hour meeting in Rome on Monday between U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan and China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi was described as ""tough"" and ""intense"" by U.S. officials.

Biden's administration has not offered evidence of its claim that China has signaled a willingness to help Russia. Moscow has denied asking China for military assistance, and China's foreign ministry called the idea ""disinformation.""

However, Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said this week the country was counting on China to help it withstand the blow to its economy from punishing Western sanctions aimed at isolating Russia's economy from the rest of the world.
