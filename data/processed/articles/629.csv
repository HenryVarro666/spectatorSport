0,c725c827-46bb-4e8a-9654-30ed6fe4c259,[],2022-03-16,"President Biden today announced an additional $800 million in security assistance to Ukraine, bringing the total U.S. security assistance committed to Ukraine to $1 billion in just the past week, and a total of $2 billion since the start of the Biden Administration. The assistance will take the form of direct transfers of equipment from the Department of Defense to the Ukrainian military to help them defend their country against Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion.



The new $800 million assistance package includes:

800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems;

2,000 Javelin, 1,000 light anti-armor weapons, and 6,000 AT-4 anti-armor systems;

100 Tactical Unmanned Aerial Systems;

100 grenade launchers, 5,000 rifles, 1,000 pistols, 400 machine guns, and 400 shotguns;

Over 20 million rounds of small arms ammunition and grenade launcher and mortar rounds;

25,000 sets of body armor; and

25,000 helmets.

In addition to the weapons listed above, previous United States assistance committed to Ukraine includes:

Over 600 Stinger anti-aircraft systems;

Approximately 2,600 Javelin anti-armor systems;

Five Mi-17 helicopters;

Three patrol boats;

Four counter-artillery and counter-unmanned aerial system tracking radars;

Four counter-mortar radar systems;

200 grenade launchers and ammunition;

200 shotguns and 200 machine guns;

Nearly 40 million rounds of small arms ammunition and over 1 million grenade, mortar, and artillery rounds;

70 High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs) and other vehicles;

Secure communications, electronic warfare detection systems, body armor, helmets, and other tactical gear;

Military medical equipment to support treatment and combat evacuation;

Explosive ordnance disposal and demining equipment; and

Satellite imagery and analysis capability.

In addition to the U.S.-produced short-range air defense systems the Ukrainians have been using to great effect, the United States has also identified and is helping the Ukrainians acquire additional, longer-range systems on which Ukraine’s forces are already trained, as well as additional munitions for those systems.

The United States continues to expedite the authorization and facilitation of additional assistance to Ukraine from our Allies. At least 30 countries have provided security assistance to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began. In 2022, the Department of State authorized third-party transfers of defensive equipment from more than 14 countries, a number that continues to grow as Allies and Partners increase support to Ukraine.

1,c725c827-46bb-4e8a-9654-30ed6fe4c259,[],2022-03-17,"Earlier this month, the Biden-Harris Administration released the National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan, a roadmap to move the country forward safely and continue to fight COVID-19 as Americans get back to their more normal routines. Today the Administration is launching the Clean Air in Buildings Challenge, a key component of the President’s Plan, that calls on all building owners and operators, schools, colleges and universities, and organizations of all kinds to adopt key strategies to improve indoor air quality in their buildings and reduce the spread of COVID-19.



The Clean Air in Buildings Challenge is a call to action for leaders and building owners and operators of all types to assess their indoor air quality and make ventilation and air filtration improvements to help keep occupants safe. As part of the Challenge, today, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a best practices guide for improving indoor air quality and reducing the risk of spreading dangerous airborne particles. This guide – developed in collaboration with the Department of Energy, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other federal agencies – contains a set of clear recommendations organized into four groups:

Create a clean indoor air action plan that assesses indoor air quality, plans for upgrades and improvements, and includes HVAC inspections and maintenance. Optimize fresh air ventilation by bringing in and circulating clean outdoor air indoors. Enhance air filtration and cleaning using the central HVAC system and in-room air cleaning devices. Engage the building community by communicating with building occupants to increase awareness, commitment, and participation.

Under each of these recommendation areas, EPA’s best practices guide lays out clear-cut actions building owners and operators can implement. The best practices guide is designed to serve as a menu of improvements to choose from. The guide includes quick steps that all organizations can take right away as a starting place, as well as resources to help plan for longer-term investments and improvements.



The Biden Administration and Congress have provided hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funds that can be used in schools, public buildings, and other settings to improve indoor air quality. The American Rescue Plan provided $350 billion for state and local governments, as well as $122 billion for schools, that can be used to support making ventilation and filtration upgrades. These American Rescue Plan dollars are being put to work in communities around the country in improving Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. Funding within the State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund program and the Elementary and Secondary School Education Relief program can be spent on inspection, testing, and maintenance of current ventilation systems; purchasing portable air filtration units, with HEPA air filters; purchasing MERV-13 (or higher) filters for HVAC system and air conditioners; purchasing fans; repairing windows and/or doors; servicing, upgrading, or replacing HVAC systems consistent with industry standards; and more.



As detailed in the National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan, the Administration will continue to advance indoor air quality in buildings in additional ways, including:

Supporting state, local, and Tribal governments as well as school districts to make ventilation improvements and upgrades using American Rescue Plan (ARP) and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funds. The Administration will work closely with public sector partners like schools to provide guidance and technical assistance to make these improvements and connect them to agency resources on indoor air quality.



Building public awareness around ventilation and filtration improvements to reduce disease spread in buildings. The Administration will build public awareness and communicate with the public on how ventilation and good indoor air quality are key factors in keeping Americans safe while inside buildings. The Administration will launch efforts to explain what good ventilation and air filtration look like as an important component of helping to reduce disease spread, and how buildings of any kind can pursue improvements to their ventilation and air filtration strategies.



Highlighting actions taken by buildings to achieve clean, healthy air quality through a recognition program. While the Administration invites all buildings to take actions from the Clean Air in Buildings Challenge, the Administration will also foster ways to recognize steps taken by buildings to improve indoor air quality and protect their communities. Similar to how programs like LEED, Fitwel, and WELL recognize buildings for their environmental and health impacts, this new effort between the federal government and external experts will develop ways to recognize steps taken by building owners for the health and safety of their communities and their achievements in improving air filtration and ventilation systems to protect and promote public health.



Catalyzing science and technology innovation to reduce indoor disease transmission. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), in coordination with other partners through the Pandemic Innovation Task Force, is identifying opportunities to drive innovation and implementation of technologies to support clean indoor air in buildings and reduce disease transmission. OSTP will also host a series of public engagements to provide the latest science, tools, and best practices on improving indoor air quality.

Eisenhower Executive Office Building

1:01 P.M. EDT

THE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. I want to begin by thanking President Zelenskyy for his passionate message this morning. I listened to it in the private residence, and he was convincing. And — significant speech.



He speaks for a people who have shown remarkable courage and strength in the face of brutal aggression — courage and strength that has inspired not only Ukrainians but the entire world.

Putin is inflicting appalling — appalling devastation and horror on Ukraine — bombing apartment buildings, maternity wards, hospitals.



I mean, it’s — it’s God awful. I was speaking about this with the — our — our Commander, behind me here — General Milley. I mean, it just is amazing.

Yesterday, we saw reports that Russian forces were holding hundreds of doctors and patients hostage in the largest hospital in Mariupol. These are atrocities. They’re an outrage to the world. And the world is united in our support for Ukraine and our determination to make Putin pay a very heavy price.



America is leading this effort, together with our Allies and partners, providing enormous levels of security and humanitarian assistance that we’re adding to today and we’re going to continue to do more in the days and weeks ahead.



We are crippling Putin’s economy with punishing sanctions that’s going to only grow more painful over time with the entire NATO and EU behind us, and many other countries.

What’s at stake here are the principles that the United States and the united nations across the world stand for. It’s about freedom. It’s about the right of people to determine their own future. It’s about making sure Ukraine never — will never be a victory for Putin, no matter what advances he makes on the battlefield.

The American people are answering President Zelenskyy’s call for more help, more weapons for Ukraine to defend itself, more tools to fight Russian aggression. And that’s what we’re doing.



In fact, we started our assistance to Ukraine before this war began, as they started to do exercises along the Ukrainian border — the Russians — starting in March of last year.



We took the threat of Putin invading very seriously, and we acted on it. We sent Ukraine more security assistance last year — $650 million in weapons, including anti-air and anti-armor equipment before the invasion — more than we had ever provided before. So when the invasion began, they already had in their hands the kinds of weapons they needed to counter Russian advances.

And once the war started, we immediately rushed $350 million in additional aid to further address their needs: hundreds of anti-air systems, thousands of anti-tank weapons, transport helicopters, armed patrol boats, and other high-mobility vehicles, radar systems that help track incoming artillery and unmanned drones, secure communications equipment and tactical gear, satellite imagery and — and analysis capacity. And it’s clearly helped Ukraine inflict dramatic losses on Russian forces.

On Saturday, my administration authorized another $200 million to keep a steady flow of weapons and ammunition moving to Ukraine. Now I’m once again using my presidential authority to activate — to activate additional security assistance to continue to help Ukraine fend off Russia’s assault — an additional $800 million in assistance. That brings the total of new U.S. security assistance to Ukraine to $1 billion just this week. These are the lar- — these are direct transfers of equipment from our Department of Defense to the Ukrainian military to help them as they fight against this invasion.

And I thank the Congress for appropriating these funds.

This new package on its own is going to provide unprecedented assistance to Ukraine. It includes 800 anti-aircraft systems to make sure the Ukrainian military can continue to — can continue to stop the planes and helicopters that have been attacking their people and to defend their Ukrainian airspace.

And at the request of President Zelenskyy, we have identified and are helping Ukraine acquire additional longer-range anti-aircraft systems and the munitions for those systems.

Our new assistance package also includes 9,000 anti-armor systems. These are portable, high — high-accurate — high accurately — high-accuracy shoulder-mounted missiles that the Ukrainian forces have been using with great effect to destroy invading tanks and armored vehicles.

It’ll include 7,000 small arms — machine guns, shotguns, grenade launchers — to equip the Ukrainians, including the brave women and men who are defending their cities as civilians, and they’re on the countryside as well. And we’re — and we — and as well as the ammunition, artillery, and mortar rounds to go with small arms — 20 million rounds in total. Twenty million rounds. And this will include drones, which — which demonstrates our commitment to sending our most cutting-edge systems to Ukraine for its defense.

And we’re not doing this alone. Our Allies and partners have stepped up to provide significant shipments of security assistance and will continue to help facilitate these deliveries as well.

The United States and our Allies and partners are fully committed to surging weapons of assistance to the Ukrainians. And more will be coming as we source additional stocks of equipment that are — that we’re ready to transfer.

Now — now, I want to be honest with you: This could be a long and difficult battle. But the American people will be steadfast in our support of the people of Ukraine in the face of Putin’s immoral, unethical attacks on civilian populations. We are united in our abhorrence of Putin’s depraved onslaught, and we’re going to continue to have their back as they fight for their freedom, their democracy, their very survival. And we’re going to give Ukraine the arms to fight and defend themselves through all the difficult days ahead.

We’re going to continue to mobilize humanitarian relief to support people within Ukraine and those who have been forced to flee Ukraine.



In just the past few weeks, we’ve provided $300 million in humanitarian assistance to the people in Ukraine and in neighboring countries. Tens of thousands of tons of food, water, medicine, and other basic supplies to support the people in need.

Our experts on the ground in Poland and Moldova and other neighboring countries are there to make real-time assessments of the rapidly evolving crisis and get urgently needed humanitarian supplies to the people in need when they need it.

And we will support Ukraine’s economy with direct financial assistance as well.

And together with our Allies and partners, we will keep up the pressure on Putin’s crumbling economy, isolating him on the global stage. That’s our goal: make Putin pay the price, weaken his position while strengthening the hand of the Ukrainians on the battlefield and at the negotiating table.

Together with our Allies and partners, we’re going to stay the course. And we’ll do everything we can to push for and end this tragic, unnecessary war. This is a struggle that pits the appetites of an autocrat against humankind’s desire to be free.

And let there be no doubt, no uncertainty, no question: America stands with the forces of freedom. We always have and we always will.

I want to thank you all. And God bless you. And now I’m going to walk over and sign this legisla- — sign this bill to allow the drawdown of those materials.

And may God protect the young Ukrainians who are out there defending their country.

What I’m signing here is the Delegation of Authority Under Section 506(a)(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. Translated into plain English: a total of $800 million in defense articles.

(The Delegation of Authority is signed.)

Q Mr. President, what will it take for you to send the Polish MiGs that President Zelenskyy is asking for?

THE PRESIDENT: I’m not going to comment on that right now. I’m not going to comment on anything other than what I told you (inaudible).

Thank you.

The funds will go toward drones, 800 antiaircraft systems, 9,000 antiarmor systems, 7,000 small-arm machine guns, as well as grenade launchers and shotguns.

Funds also will be used to help care for the more than 3 million Ukrainians displaced by the war, while bolstering the country's defenses as Russian forces try to encircle the capital city Kyiv.

""This new package on its own is going to provide unprecedented assistance to Ukraine,"" Biden said at the White House, hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealed to the Congress for more help in fighting back the invasion.

""May God protect the Ukrainians who are out there defending their country,"" the president said.",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/16/russia-ukraine-news-biden-details-defense-assistance.html
6,c725c827-46bb-4e8a-9654-30ed6fe4c259,['Anita Powell'],,"U.S. President Joe Biden answered Ukraine’s plea for help on Wednesday with an $800 million assistance package that includes a range of weapons and defensive gear — a response that falls short of the no-fly zone Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy seeks as his country faces continued attacks from Russia.

But Biden also raised the temperature in the war of words between himself and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“I think he is a war criminal,” Biden said, speaking to journalists at an event later in the day. He did not elaborate and walked away.

In response, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the TASS news agency Biden's statement was ""unacceptable and unforgivable rhetoric.""

“The president's remarks speak for themselves,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said, when pressed for details. “He was speaking from his heart and speaking from what you've seen on television, which is barbaric actions by a brutal dictator through his invasion of a foreign country.”

Putin launched the invasion of Ukraine three weeks ago. His forces have struck hospitals, schools and homes. Zelenskyy said that about 100 children have been killed in the full-scale attack.

The new U.S. aid package “brings the total of new U.S. security assistance to Ukraine to $1 billion just this week,” Biden said.

“This new package on its own is going to provide unprecedented assistance to Ukraine,” the president added. “It includes 800 anti-aircraft systems to make sure the Ukrainian military can continue to stop the planes and helicopters that have been attacking their people and to defend their Ukrainian airspace.”

In addition to the 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems that Biden mentioned, the package includes 2,000 Javelin and 1,000 light anti-armor weapons, and 6,000 AT-4 anti-armor systems; hundreds of grenade launchers, shotguns and machine guns; thousands of rifles and pistols; more than 20 million rounds of ammunition and tens of thousands of sets of body armor and helmets.

The Pentagon Wednesday said efforts to deliver the equipment are already underway.

“We understand the tyranny of time here,” a senior U.S. defense official told reporters, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence and other sensitive matters.

“We've already started working on how to source all these all these items and get them there as quickly as possible,” the official said, noting that despite Russian threats, “things are still getting into the hands of the Ukrainians … Those routes are still open.”

The official declined to go into detail about reports that some allies, including Slovakia, are willing to provide Kyiv with the Russian-made S-300 air defense system, capable of shooting down enemy aircraft as well as some ballistic missiles and cruise missiles.

“There are air defense systems, mobile systems that that we know the Ukrainians know how to use and we also know that there are allies and partners who also possess them and might be willing to provide,” the official said. “We’re actively having those discussions.”

The new U.S. assistance package follows an impassioned plea Zelenskyy made Wednesday to U.S. lawmakers, begging them to do more to protect his nation amid a 3-week-old onslaught by Russian forces.

Watch video by VOA's Katherine Gypson:

In his speech before a joint session of Congress, Zelenskyy evoked some of the worst traumas of American history to ask the U.S. to give more military assistance and impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine’s besieged cities.

“Right now, the destiny of our country is being decided,” Zelenskyy said, speaking virtually to a packed session of U.S. lawmakers in a speech that evoked the painful memories of Japan’s 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, which spurred the U.S. to enter World War II; and the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, which launched the U.S.’s multifront, two-decades-long Global War on Terror.

The 44-year-old actor-turned-president, who spoke in English for part of his address, also raised the more inspiring parts of American history, including the words of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.

“I need to protect our sky,” Zelenskyy said. “I need your decision, your help, which means exactly the same, the same you feel when you hear the words, ‘I have a dream.’”

He reiterated his request for a no-fly zone, a request the White House has said would put the U.S. into direct confrontation with Russia.

‘Not-too-hot, not-too-cold’

Stephen Biddle, a professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University, described Biden’s response as “about the right not-too-hot, not-too-cold solution” that will help Ukraine defend itself while avoiding a confrontation between two nuclear powers.

Zelenskyy’s requests for air support “will have only a marginal effect on the military outcome in Ukraine. The primary Russian threat to Ukraine right now is not the Russian air force, which so far has been surprisingly ineffective,” Biddle said.

“Biden has the responsibility of statesmanship to resist even a powerful dramatic appeal from an immensely sympathetic hero in the form of Zelenskyy and do what we can to help, but not necessarily do everything Zelenskyy is asking him to do,” Biddle told VOA, via Skype. “Sometimes, statesmanship involves making very hard unpleasant choices, like not doing everything a brave, noble underdog ally would like you to do.”

Psaki said Biden watched Zelenskyy’s speech from the White House. She said the administration is in close contact with the Ukrainian government and that none of Zelenskyy’s requests came as a surprise.

“If we were President Zelenskyy, we would be asking for everything possible as well, and continuing to ask for it,” she said. “Because he is watching his country and his people be attacked and brutalized by President Putin and the Russian military. But how President Biden makes decisions is through the prism of our own national security, and as we've said before, a no-fly zone would require implementation, it would require us potentially shooting down Russian planes, NATO shooting down Russian planes, and we are not interested in getting into World War III.”

Instead, Washington is pursuing what officials say are harsh and effective sanctions against Russia, with a special focus on the wealthy elites who surround Russian President Vladimir Putin. To that end, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen and Attorney General Merrick Garland met virtually on Wednesday with officials from Australia, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the European Commission to launch the Russian Elites, Proxies, and Oligarchs (REPO) multilateral task force.

‘This is a lie’

Putin seems to be unfazed by the opposition, and told Russian media on Wednesday that he will continue what he describes as a “special operation” in Ukraine.

“The West is trying to convince its citizens that their difficulties are the result of Russia’s actions, but this is a lie,” Russian media reported Putin as saying.

Following a meeting with NATO defense ministers in Brussels on Wednesday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg reiterated that the alliance is “united” in holding firm in their opposition to imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine, despite Zelenskyy’s repeated calls for one.

He also said the alliance must continue to provide significant support to Ukraine, including military supplies, financial help and humanitarian aid. He also called on Russia to stop its attacks on Ukraine.

“Allies are united both in providing support to Ukraine, to support Ukraine to uphold the right for self-defense,” Stoltenberg told a press conference. “But allies are also united when it comes to that NATO should not deploy forces on the ground or in the airspace of Ukraine. Because we have a responsibility to ensure that this conflict, this war, doesn't escalate beyond Ukraine.”

Russia has objected to NATO’s presence near its borders and sought a guarantee that Ukraine will never join the alliance. NATO insists countries are free to make their own decisions about security ties.

While Ukraine is not part of NATO, seven NATO countries share borders with Russia, Ukraine or Russian ally Belarus, and that proximity has raised concerns of a wider conflict.

Stoltenberg said Wednesday there are 100,000 U.S. troops in Europe and another 40,000 troops under direct NATO command, as well as hundreds of thousands more on heightened alert across NATO nations.

Biden is to join other NATO leaders in Brussels for a summit taking place March 24, marking one month since Russia launched its invasion after denying for months it planned to do so.

On the ground in Ukraine, the country’s emergencies agency reported a 12-story residential building was among the targets hit by Russian forces. Ukrainian officials also said Russia bombed a theater in Mariupol where hundreds of people were taking shelter.

VOA’s White House bureau chief Patsy Widakuswara and national security correspondent Jeff Seldin and congressional correspondent Katherine Gypson contributed to this report.

7,c725c827-46bb-4e8a-9654-30ed6fe4c259,[],2022-03-16,"WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden on Wednesday approved a new $800 million security assistance package for Ukraine, bringing U.S. military aid to the war-torn country to $1 billion since last week.

""The world is united in our support for Ukraine and our determination to make Putin pay a very heavy price. America's leading this effort, together with our allies and partners, providing an enormous level of security and humanitarian assistance that we're adding to today,” Biden said in a public address from the White House.

The $800 million is the highest amount given in a single security assistance package to Ukraine and will include weapons to help defend Ukrainian airspace from Russian attacks, the president said.

“This new package on its own is going to provide unprecedented assistance to Ukraine,” Biden said. “It includes 800 [Stinger]anti-aircraft systems to make sure the Ukrainian military can continue to stop the planes and helicopters that have been attacking their people and to defend the Ukrainian airspace.""

The White House said the assistance package also includes 2,000 Javelin anti-tank systems, 1,000 light anti-armor weapons and 6,000 AT-4 anti-armor systems.

Biden said sending 9,000 “portable, high-accuracy, shoulder-mounted” anti-armor systems will help because Ukrainians “have already been using [such systems] with great effect to destroy invading tanks and armored vehicles.”

The package will also include 100 tactical drones, which Biden said demonstrates the U.S. “commitment to sending our most cutting-edge systems to Ukraine for its defense.”

Additionally, the U.S. will provide 7,000 small arms, such as machine guns, shotguns, grenade launchers and about 20 million rounds of ammunition, and 25,000 sets of body armor and helmets, according to the White House.

The announcement came hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asked Congress for such systems to strike down Russian air assaults.

Biden called Zelenskyy’s speech “convincing and significant,” and he said the U.S. has “identified and are helping Ukraine acquire additional longer-range and aircraft systems and the munitions for those systems.”

During his address to Congress, Zelenskyy pleaded for the U.S. to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine, but said the U.S. could instead send surface-to-air missile systems to help secure the skies against Russian assaults.

“If this is too much to ask, we offer an alternative: You know what kind of defense systems we need, S-300 and other similar [surface-to-air missile] systems,” he said. “You know how much depends on the battlefield on [Russia’s] ability to use aircraft.""

The U.S. opposes a no-fly zone over Ukraine because it would put U.S. forces in direct contact with Russian forces. Biden has repeatedly pledged not to send American service members into the country to fight the Russians.

Zelenskyy also said Ukraine needs “powerful, strong, aviation to protect our people, our freedom.”

“Lend [us] aircraft that can help Ukraine, help Europe,” he said. “You know that they exist and you have them, but they are not in Ukraine in the Ukrainian sky.”

The comment came after the U.S. declined last week to accept Polish fighter jets to transfer to Ukraine.

The Pentagon on March 9 rejected a plan offered by Poland to donate its fleet of MiG-29 fighter jets to the U.S. to transfer to Ukraine, chief Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said at the time.

“The intelligence community has assessed the transfer of MiG-29s to Ukraine may be mistaken as escalatory and could result in significant Russian reaction that might increase the prospects of a military escalation with NATO,” he said.

Aside from the “high-risk,” the U.S. believes fighter jets are not among “the systems that [Ukrainian forces] need most to defeat Russian aggression,” Kirby said, noting the Ukrainian air force still had “several squadrons of fully mission-capable aircraft.”

As of Tuesday, Ukraine and Russia still had 90% of its combat power available, a senior defense official said.

“We assess that adding aircraft to the Ukrainian inventory is not likely to significantly change the effectiveness of Ukrainian air force relative to Russian capabilities,” Kirby said March 9. “Therefore, we believe that the gain from transferring those MiG-29s is low.”

With the new package, U.S. has now given about $2 billion in security assistance packages to Ukraine in the past year, and more than $6.4 billion since Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014, according to the State Department.

The White House on Wednesday for the first time named some of the weapons that the U.S. has sent in previous Ukrainian security assistance packages. Until now, the administration had kept the details of its packages mostly secret.

Previous packages included 600 Stingers, 2,600 Javelins, five Mi-17 helicopters, three patrol boats, four counter-artillery and counter-drone tracking radars, four counter-mortar radar systems, 200 grenade launchers and ammunition, as well as 200 shotguns and machine guns, 40 million rounds of small arms ammunition and more than 1 million grenade, mortar and artillery rounds, according to the statement.

The U.S. also has sent military vehicles that include 70 high-mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicles, secure communications and electronic warfare detection systems, tactical gear, military medical supplies, explosive ordnance disposal and de-mining equipment, and satellite imagery and analysis capabilities, the White House said.

Biden on Tuesday signed into law a funding bill that allotted $3.5 billion to the Pentagon to help resupply U.S. military stocks of equipment already given out in security assistance packages, Defense Department spokesman Christopher Sherwood said.

The funds signed into law Tuesday will now allow the Pentagon to move “expeditiously” to deliver Biden’s new security assistance package, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement Wednesday.",https://www.stripes.com/theaters/us/2022-03-16/ukraine-russia-war-military-aid-biden-5365690.html
8,c725c827-46bb-4e8a-9654-30ed6fe4c259,[],2022-03-17,"Pelosi’s remarks in the closed-door Democratic meeting, relayed by multiple people in the room, reflect a growing frustration among party leaders about the difficult path forward for the $15 billion pandemic assistance measure. Pelosi, along with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and President Joe Biden, are searching for a way to approve that funding after members of her caucus rebelled over how the package would be paid for — specifically, clawing back hundreds of millions in unspent state government aid.

Walking out of the Thursday morning meeting, Pelosi was confident the legislation could soon pass both chambers of Congress and land on Biden’s desk.

“We’re just going to have to pass it, and we’ll pass it when we have the votes to pass it,” Pelosi said in a brief interview. “In order to have bipartisan votes, we want it to be paid for, and that’s what we’re doing.”

Later on Thursday, Pelosi suggested to reporters that the total should be even more than $15 billion, given the delay.

“The resources that we would have had in the bill I think need to be enhanced, now because we’re another week later and we still don’t have it.”

Amid intensifying White House pleas for a new strategy to pay for the Covid aid, Pelosi and her leadership team are ditching the controversial state offsets and trying to find a Plan B. But that brings up a bigger problem for the party: Now that the cash has been detached from the giant bipartisan spending deal that leaders had assumed would guarantee its passage, how do they get it through the 50-50 Senate?

It’s unclear when that package could get a vote, with the House slated to leave for a one-week recess on Friday without the bill on the schedule.

Several Senate Republican swing votes have sounded skeptical about delivering any more Covid cash, insisting that the White House needs to be clearer about exactly what it needs.

“Believe it or not, the administration has not provided the information that we Republicans asked for,” said Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah). “Nevertheless, Leader Schumer did agree with our leadership [on] a $15 billion package with money repurposed with prior Covid funds. It was stopped, as you know, by House progressives. But the money was there.”

“They have demonstrated that there’s money that’s not been spent, that can be used to meet the needs,” Romney added. “And we fully agree that they should do that.”

In fact, the House Democratic pushback ranged beyond progressives; it was dominated by members from states whose unspent pandemic aid would have gotten redirected to the new assistance package. That complicated stalemate has frustrated White House officials who say many lawmakers still don’t fully understand the consequences of failing to fund the Covid response — and who fear those members won’t get it until it’s too late.

In talks with the Hill, the administration has emphasized the urgency of its full $22.5 billion request, sending lawmakers lists of pandemic programs that are low on cash, and circulating internal projections for when supplies of specific treatments and vaccines will be exhausted.

Many Democrats say a compromise with Republicans is still possible, but concede it will be an uphill battle to win GOP support for a second agreement. Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) spoke to the White House this week about a path forward for Covid aid relief, but said Republicans need to know where and how the previous money was spent.

Senate Minority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) predicted that the odds of 10 Republicans supporting a Covid relief package are “not good” if the money doesn’t come from repurposed funds. Ultimately, GOP votes will depend on offsets, he said.

“It would have passed, they could have had it,” Thune said. “Now... this is a whole different conversation.”

Democrats acknowledge the far simpler path was to pass the aid as part of the bipartisan spending deal, which included sweeteners for the GOP like huge Pentagon funding increases and Ukrainian aid.

Now, the two parties must try to make a deal on pandemic aid alone, after a rebellion from several House Democrats forced party leaders to scuttle plans to include that money in the broader package. Those Democrats objected to party leaders’ plan to pay for a big chunk of that cash by repurposing hundreds of millions of dollars in certain states’ unused state pandemic aid.

“It’s a big challenge,” said Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) of the path forward in the Senate. “I think we’ve put together a responsible bipartisan approach, I’m sorry the House didn’t approve it.”

Durbin complained that some of the House Democrats refused to support it over a “small, small percentage of federal funds” that their states would have lost: “It really was not too much to ask considering the gravity of the situation.”

But the multiple House Democrats who did oppose the legislation felt strongly they had no choice. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.) said he was prepared to buck his own party’s leadership for the first time in 18 years.

“It was a mistake. It’s just the biggest one we’ve had since I’ve been here,” Cleaver said, reflecting on the previous week. “It put me in the worst spot that I’ve been in here.”

Even as House Democrats waffle over Covid aid, the administration has reserved its sharpest criticism for Republicans in the Senate, who have maintained the White House has not demonstrated the need for more money.

Meanwhile, Biden’s administration has come to believe that most GOP senators now understand the government is in dire need of more Covid money, but are still feigning uncertainty as an excuse not to support additional funding, according to one White House official who was granted anonymity to speak candidly. But there’s no path to passage without Senate GOP support, the official acknowledged, saying the money is needed within the next two to three weeks and thus can’t wait for a broader, must-pass package to come before Congress. The House will return March 28.

Officials have reiterated that need by explaining that monoclonal antibody treatments — which both Republican and Democratic governors have touted as lifesaving drugs — will run out within weeks. The White House told state leaders this week that it is cutting allotments of the treatments by 30 percent beginning next week. Even after that, the government only has enough supply to last until May.

Still, the administration is struggling to convince skeptical members of the gravity of the situation. The same White House official ventured that because the administration has always had vaccines and treatments on hand, some lawmakers don’t fully appreciate how quickly those stockpiles could disappear. Others are simply tired of the pandemic, the official added, and don’t want to continue dealing with it.

Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), who controls health spending for the House GOP, said he believes some funding will ultimately be approved. But he’s not sure the path to get there, only noting that he believed enough Republicans would eventually support a package as long as it is fully paid for.

Democrats “made it very hard,” Cole said. “Why would Republicans vote for more deficit spending or whatever, when we think the money’s there? And we actually had a solution.”
