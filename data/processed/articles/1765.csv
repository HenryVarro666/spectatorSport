NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg:



Foreign Minister Kuleba,

Dear Dmytro,

Welcome to NATO.

It is always a great pleasure to welcome you here.

And let me start by expressing how much we admire your courage, your leadership.

You personally, but also the Government of Ukraine, the people of Ukraine.

And, of course, the bravery and the courage of Ukrainian armed forces.

What you do every day, standing up against the Russian aggression, is something that inspires the whole world.

And as you know, NATO Allies have provided support for Ukraine for many years.

Trained tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops.

And now Allies are providing equipment, support to you to uphold your right for self defence.

A right which is enshrined in the UN Charter.

And it is an urgent need to further support Ukraine.

And at our meeting later on with the NATO Foreign Ministers, I am certain that we will address the need for more air defence systems, anti-tank weapons, lighter, but also heavier weapons, and many different types of support to Ukraine.

NATO also has a responsibility to, of course, protect and defend all Allies.

So we have since the invasion of Ukraine stepped up our military presence in eastern part of the Alliance.

And we are making sure that there is no room for misunderstanding, miscalculation in Moscow about our readiness to protect and defend all Allies.

You being here provides us with the very good opportunity to sit down with you.

To listen to your assessment, your analysis.

And together, discuss the way forward, how we can further support Ukraine.

So dear, Dmytro, please, welcome.

It is good to have you here.

Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Dmytro Kuleba:

Good morning.

Thank you, Jens, for welcoming me.

I came to Brussels to participate in the NATO ministerial.

And to hold bilateral meetings with Allies.

My agenda is very simple.

It only has three items on it.

It’s weapons, weapons, and weapons.

We are confident that the best way to help Ukraine now is to provide it with all necessary to contain Putin, and to defeat Russian army in Ukraine, in the territory of Ukraine, so that the war does not spill over further.

In the recent month, in the recent weeks Ukrainian army and the entire Ukrainian nation has demonstrated that we know how to fight.

We know how to win.

But without sustainable and sufficient supplies of all weapons requested by Ukraine, these wins will be accompanied with enormous sacrifices.

The more weapons we get, and the sooner they arrive in Ukraine, the more human lives will be saved.

The more cities and villages will not be destructed.

And there will be no more Buchas.

This is my message to the Allies.

It is very simple.

And I call on all Allies to put aside their hesitations.

Their reluctance to provide Ukraine with everything it needs.

Because, as weird as it may sound, but today weapons serve the purpose of peace.

Thank you.

Question 1: Secretary General, are you ready or are Allies ready to send more offensive weapons to Ukraine? And one question to the Minister. Do you think that Germany is doing enough?

NATO Secretary General: Allies are sending many different types of weapons. And I think also we need to realize that Allies have supported Ukraine for many years. And these weapons, so the support we have provided is proving its importance on the battleground every day. We can see all the Russian armor that has been destroyed. We have seen the Russian planes being shut down. And of course, this is first and foremost because of the bravery, the commitment and the courage of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. But the equipment that has been supplied is of course also of vital importance. I have urged Allies to provide further support of many different types of systems. Both the light weapons but also heavier weapons. It is as Foreign Minister Kuleba states, Ukraine needs weapons to defend its own country. And this is actually defensive self-defence also, of course, with advanced weapon systems. So I expect this to be one important issue at the meeting today.

Minister Kuleba: When it comes to Ukraine, there should be no such difference as between defensive weapons and offensive weapons. Because every weapon used in the territory of Ukraine, by the Ukrainian army, against a foreign aggressor is defensive by definition. So this distinction between defensive and offensive doesn't make any sense when it comes to the situation in my country. And those countries who are saying we will provide Ukraine with defensive weapons but we are not in a position to provide them with offensive weapons, they are hypocritical. This is simply unfair, unjustified approach.

Germany, as you perfectly know has made a revolutionary step in changing its position from not agreeing to supply any weapons at all, to allowing certain supplies and providing Ukraine in particular with anti-tank weapons. However, it's clear that Germany can do more given its reserves, reserves and capacity and we are working with the German government on providing us with additional weapons. The issue that concerns me the most is the length of procedures and decision making in Berlin. Because while Berlin has time, Kyiv doesn't.

Question 2: Minister, what do you think about the most recent sanctions proposals?

Minister Kuleba: Well, I hope they will be applied in full. This is definitely a step forward. A week ago, the sanctions proposals were much weaker, to say the least. We were very unhappy about it. We were working with partners in G7 and in the European Union to ensure that sanction pressure is stepped up. We succeeded, but I cannot say that we succeeded 100%. We will continue to insist on full oil and gas embargo for Russia, on de-SWIFTing all Russian banks, on making sure that all ports are closed for Russian vessels and Russian goods with the minimal number of exemptions from it based on humanitarian grounds.

And frankly speaking, I hope we will never face a situation again, when to step up the sanctions pressure you need, we need atrocities like Bucha to be revealed and to impress and to shock other partners to the extent that they sit down and say okay, fine, we will introduce new sanctions. I don't believe that Ukrainians have to pay with their lives, health and sufferings for the political will of partners to impose sanctions.

Question 3: Minister, what kind of weapons exactly do you need? Is it planes, long ranging missiles? What exactly are you asking for?

Minister Kuleba: Planes, short to vessel missiles, personnel armored vehicles, heavy air defence systems.

Question 4: Foreign Minister, I would like to ask you, you say: weapons, weapons, weapons are your priorities today. For you on a personal note, how difficult would it be when some of the NATO Allies tell you that they can't give you some weapons because they don't want to plunge the West into a wider war with Russia? And just a word on the support Britain is giving your country.

And Secretary General, can you just remind us what has changed in the last few days in light of the horrors we've seen? And do you think partners in NATO, their minds will be changed today from what you'll hear from the minister?

Minister Kuleba: Yes, there are two ways of approaching the issue of weapons supplies. The first one is when you do not want to supply anything, you come up with the argument: we don't have to do it because it will pull us or NATO as a whole into the war. The second approach is completely different. This line of thinking is completely different. We will provide Ukraine with all necessary weapons so that we, neither we nor NATO as a whole, will have to fight in this war, because Ukrainians will do it for us. I think the deal that Ukraine is offering is fair. You give us weapons, we sacrifice our lives and the war is contained in Ukraine. This is it. The United Kingdom has been at the forefront of providing Ukraine with all necessary assistance and we deeply appreciate that help.

NATO Secretary General: I think fundamentally, what we have seen over the last days is the brutality of this war. And that has just highlighted the importance of support to Ukraine. And therefore I think it is important that we have Minister Kuleba here today to meet all NATO Allies and to discuss how we can further support Ukraine.

NATO Allies are providing many different types of weapons also heavier systems, advanced systems, and also systems that can shoot down planes and of course attack Russian armour. And it is exactly as Minister Kuleba said that, you know, Ukraine is fighting the defensive war. So this distinction between offensive and defensive weapons doesn't actually have any real meaning in defensive war as Ukraine is fighting. What we also have seen is, of course, that we need both the support with weapons but also to step up sanctions. And therefore, I also welcome the fact that NATO Allies are now in the process of stepping up further sanctions on Russia.

NATO provides support to Ukraine but NATO is not sending troops to be on the ground. And we also have a responsibility to prevent this conflict from escalating beyond Ukraine and become even more deadly, even more dangerous and destructive. So we are providing support but at the same time, working hard to prevent the escalation of the conflict.",https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_194508.htm

BRUSSELS -- Spurred into action by reports of atrocities in Ukraine, NATO countries agreed Thursday to ramp up the supply of weapons to Kyiv, including hi-tech arms, amid concerns that Russia is about to launch a large offensive in Ukrarine's eastern Donbas region.

NATO, as an organization, refuses to send troops or weapons to Ukraine or impose a no-fly zone over it to keep the trans-Atlantic military group from being drawn into a wider war with nuclear-armed Russia. Individual NATO countries, however, have provided anti-aircraft and anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, as well as equipment and medical supplies.

“There was a clear message from the meeting today that allies should do more, and are ready to do more, to provide more equipment, and they realize and recognize the urgency,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said after chairing a meeting of allied foreign ministers in Brussels.

Stoltenberg declined to say which countries were stepping up supplies or what kinds of equipment they might send, but he said: “Rest assured, allies are providing a wide range of different weapons systems, both Soviet-era systems but also modern equipment.”

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the “sickening images and accounts coming out of Bucha and other parts of Ukraine” have strengthened the West’s resolve to punish Russia and step up support for Ukraine.

Blinken said the United States is “looking across the board right now not only at what we provided, and what we continue to provide, but whether there are additional systems that could make a difference.”

One of the drawbacks of sending modern arms is that Ukrainian troops would have to learn how to to use them, but some NATO nations raised the possibility of providing training outside of the war-ravaged country.

Britain was also outspoken about its intentions.

“We’ve agreed to step up support for Ukraine and we’ve also recognized that the conflict has entered a new and different phase with a more concentrated Russian offensive,” British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said.

“There was support for countries to supply new and heavier equipment to Ukraine so that they can respond to these new threats from Russia. We’ve agreed to help Ukrainian forces move from their Soviet-era equipment to NATO-standard equipment on a bilateral basis,” Truss said.

After talks with his NATO counterparts, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said he was cautiously optimistic that some countries would boost weapons supplies to his nation. But he warned that those arms must get to Ukraine quickly, with Russia set to attack more widely in the east.

“Either you help us now — and I’m speaking about days, not weeks — or your help will come too late,” Kuleba said his message was to NATO countries. Asked what more his country was seeking, Kuleba listed planes, land-based missiles, armored vehicles and air defense systems.

He also criticized some Western countries for failing to impose sanctions quickly enough, or of acting too late, highlighting his point with the reports of war crimes in the northern town of Bucha.

“How many Buchas have to take place for you to impose sanctions? How many children, women, men, have to die,” Kuleba said, “for you to understand that you cannot allow sanctions fatigue, as we cannot allow fighting fatigue?”

Some NATO countries sending weapons have been making a distinction about what kind of support they can provide, saying Ukraine should only receive arms for defensive purposes and not offensive weapons like war planes or tanks.

But Stoltenberg rejected the rhetorical arguments. “Ukraine is fighting a defensive war, so this distinction between offensive and defensive weapons doesn’t actually have any real meaning,” he said.

Stoltenberg said he has “urged allies to provide further support of many different types of systems, both light weapons but also heavier weapons.”

Despite the allegations of Russian war crimes and warnings that more atrocities might emerge, it appears unlikely, at least for now, that the world’s biggest security alliance will agree as an organization to arm Ukraine and help end Europe’s biggest land war since World War II.

Allies ramp up military support after atrocities

Allies are upping military support to Ukraine amid the latest, devastating images of war atrocities coming from Bucha, sending more drones, missiles and, for the first time, tanks.

With Russia’s attack on Ukraine in its sixth week, however, there remains a significant chasm between what Kyiv says it needs to win the war and what the West says it can provide.

The atrocities in Bucha: Photos of civilians apparently killed execution-style by Russian troops in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha have drawn fresh outrage over the Kremlin’s attack on Ukraine.

Images of the fallen suggested Russian troops had indiscriminately tortured, shot and killed individuals during their occupation of the town, and satellite images indicated that bodies had been left in the streets for weeks, contradicting Moscow’s claims that the photos were staged.

The United States and other countries quickly moved to punish Russia, with the Biden administration on Wednesday announcing a wave of new sanctions targeting Russia’s two largest banks, Putin’s two adult daughters and family members of Russia’s top diplomat, as well as blacklisting members of Russia’s Security Council.

Send in the weapons: Earlier this week, news broke that the Czech Republic has been quietly sending old Soviet-designed tanks into Ukraine — the first time another country had provided the vehicles to Kyiv since the Kremlin began its invasion on Feb. 24.

And the Biden administration on Tuesday said it would send up to $100 million worth of Javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine, its fourth such lethal aid package to the country since the war began, after confirming that it sent more than 100 Switchblade drones.

Pushing the limits: Kyiv wants Soviet-designed MiG-29 fighter jets and S-300 long-range air defense systems currently scattered around the continent, weapons they are already familiar with and are trained to use.

Those asks, however, have been met with resistance. The U.S. has outright rejected Poland’s plans from March to transfer its entire fleet of MiG-29s to a U.S. base in Germany to then be sent to Ukraine, calling the idea not “tenable.”

And the U.S. has sought to have Slovakia provide its S-300 systems to Ukraine, but the NATO ally wants a guarantee it will quickly get a “proper replacement” for the system. There has yet to be a public agreement between the two countries.

UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER DEMANDS ‘WEAPONS, WEAPONS, WEAPONS’

Ukraine’s foreign minister is calling on NATO to provide “weapons, weapons, weapons” to aid in its defense as Russia’s invasion enters its sixth week.

Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba voiced the plea on Twitter after meeting with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg at the alliance’s headquarters in Brussels, writing that the “three most important things” to Kyiv are “weapons, weapons, weapons.”

“Met with Secretary General @jensstoltenberg at NATO HQ in Brussels. I came here today to discuss three most important things: weapons, weapons, and weapons,” Kuleba wrote on Twitter.

“Ukraine’s urgent needs, the sustainability of supplies, and long-term solutions which will help Ukraine to prevail,” he added.

Pentagon officials testify on budget proposal

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley and Pentagon Comptroller Michael McCord testified to the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday about the Pentagon’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2023.

The Pentagon officials fielded questions from senators about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the forthcoming national defense strategy and how inflation will impact the increases asked for by the Pentagon.

Recap of the proposal: The Department of Defense is asking for a $773 billion budget for fiscal year 2023, a $30.7 billion (4.1 percent) increase over what was enacted for fiscal year 2022.

The Pentagon’s budget takes up the vast majority of the Biden administration’s overall $813.3 billion national defense budget proposal, which is also a 4 percent increase over what was enacted in fiscal year 2022.

The budget prioritizes China as the Pentagon’s “pacing challenge” and requests a historic $130.1 billion for research and development. It also allocates $56.5 billion for air power platforms, $40.8 billion for sea power, and $12.6 billion to modernize Army and Marine Corps fighting vehicles.

The proposal also calls for a 4.6 percent pay raise for military and civilian personnel.

On Russia and Ukraine: While the budget proposal prioritizes China as the Pentagon’s so-called pacing challenge, Austin and Milley fielded a lot of questions about Russia and Ukraine, which is the most pressing issue for the U.S. and Europe.

The Biden administration has allocated $2.4 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the start of the Biden administration, including an additional $100 million in assistance announced on Tuesday.

In response to a question from Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Austin told the panel that the U.S. will continue to focus on giving the Ukrainian people “everything they need” as fast as possible.

A MISSING NATIONAL DEFENSE STRATEGY

Republicans confronted the Pentagon officials on not publicly releasing an unclassified version of the Biden administration’s national defense strategy.

The Pentagon has said that the budget proposal reflects the strategy, a classified version of which was sent to Congress last week.

Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) pointed out that last year, testimony on the budget was delayed until Congress had the chance to review the strategy.

“I think having this hearing without any detailed information about the budget and when we are unable to openly discuss any of the administration’s strategy documents directly undermines the committee’s ability to conduct its oversight work,” Fischer said.

“And it is contrary to the spirit of transparent government that these public hearings are intended to support,” she continued.

The elephant of inflation: Democrats and Republicans alike raised concerns about how inflation would impact the Pentagon’s budget, with the GOP arguing that the proposed budget does not properly account for inflation.

The White House predicts that inflation will rise to 4.7 percent in 2022, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), and then drop to 2.3 percent in 2023 and years later.

But McCord told lawmakers that the Pentagon uses the gross domestic product implicit price deflator (GDP deflator), which measures changes in prices of goods and services produced in the U.S., for its measure of inflation.

The proposed budget builds in 4 percent price increases during fiscal year 2023. But the proposal had been finished last year, before Russia invaded Ukraine, an event which rattled U.S. markets.

“What happened last year is not what we see happening today, and it may not be what’s happening tomorrow,” McCord said. “But with all the information we had when we finished, we caught up so that we would not fall behind on our pricing.”

US, India gear up for 2+2 dialogue

The State Department announced Thursday that it will hold a strategic dialogue with top officials from India in Washington, D.C., next week.

The State Department said that Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will welcome India’s Minister of External Affairs S. Jaishankar and Indian Minister of Defense Rajnath Singh to Washington for the fourth U.S.-India 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue on April 11.

It added that this event will also commemorate 75 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries and “reaffirm the importance of the U.S.-India Comprehensive and Global Strategic Partnership in ensuring international peace and security.”

Strengthening bilateral ties: The Indian Ministry of External Affairs said that the dialogue would enable both countries to “undertake a comprehensive review of cross-cutting issues in the India-U.S. bilateral agenda related to foreign policy, defence and security with the objective of providing strategic guidance and vision for further consolidating the relationship.”

It added that it will provide an opportunity to exchange views about important regional and global developments and how both countries can work together to “address issues of common interest and concern.”

Pressuring India on Russia: This meeting comes as India is coming under pressure from the U.S. and Western countries to take a tougher position with Russia, a country with which it has long had strong ties.

President Biden’s economic adviser, Brian Deese, issued a strongly worded statement aimed at India on Wednesday and said the U.S. has told India the consequences of a “more explicit strategic alignment” with Moscow would be “significant and long-term,” Bloomberg reported.

Last month, Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economics Daleep Singh traveled to meet with officials from India’s government in New Delhi, and criticized the South Asian country’s imports of Russian oil and its reliance on military hardware from Moscow.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Francois Walschaerts /AFP via Getty Images Francois Walschaerts /AFP via Getty Images

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told Morning Edition that he anticipates heavier fighting in the weeks and months ahead as the Ukraine war moves into a ""new phase.""

He believes that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""totally underestimated"" the strength of Ukrainian forces and the support of its Western allies. But he doesn't think Putin has changed his overall aim of controlling Ukraine — and now the Russian military has changed its strategy to focus in on the east.

""What we have seen so far is extremely bad. It has caused a lot of casualties, civilian suffering, destruction,"" he said. ""But the scale and the scope of the fight we may see in Donbas will be even much heavier and even more dangerous.""

Stoltenberg said now is the time for NATO allies to reinforce the Ukrainians, both by providing them with advanced weapons systems and resupplying them with basic necessities like fuel, ammunition, food rations and medical kits.

Interview highlights

On the war's predicted duration

It's President Putin who is responsible for this senseless war, and he can end that war tomorrow by withdrawing his troops and sit down and engage in good faith in negotiations for a political solution. But you have to be realistic and realize that that's not very likely. So therefore, we need to also be prepared for the long haul. And it's hard to predict. Wars are always unpredictable. But this can last for months and even years, and that's reason also why we need to continue to provide support to Ukraine and be prepared for doing so for a long time.

On the long-term impact of the war on Russia's relationship with NATO

There's no way we can go back to the meaningful dialogue we tried to establish with Russia for many, many years. We need now to continue to talk to Russia, to address issues like deconfliction, to prevent incidents and accidents — and if they happen to ensure that they don't spiral out of control — and also, of course, talk to Russia on issues like arms control. But the kind of dialogue and even more what we strive for to establish a better relationship with Russia, that doesn't have any meaning in the current situation.

On the morale of the Ukrainian people

I'm impressed by the courage and by the strength of not only the Ukrainian armed forces, but also the Ukrainian people, and not least the Ukrainian leadership. And its high spirit, morale has, of course, been absolutely essential for the strength in the resistance we have seen from Ukraine.

According to Stoltenberg, Allies believe it is better often to not be specific exactly about what kinds of weapons systems are provided to Ukraine.

“But rest assured Allies are providing a wide range of different weapons systems, both Soviet era systems but also modern equipment,” Stoltenberg stressed.

In his words, distinction between offensive and defensive weapons is a bit strange, “because we speak about providing weapons to a country which is defending itself and self defence is a right which is enshrined in the UN Charter”.

“So everything Ukraine does with the support from NATO Allies is defensive because they are defending themselves. And of course, they need different types of weapons. And Allies are providing them with different types of weapons and we see the impact of these weapons on the battleground every day. Because the Ukrainians have been able to inflict severe losses on the invading Russian forces,” Stoltenberg added.

During the ministerial meeting, NATO countries also utterly condemned the horrific atrocities committed by Russian troops against civilians and stressed the importance of bringing all those responsible to justice.

A reminder that, on February 24, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin initiated a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, starting a war. Russian troops are shelling and destroying the key infrastructure facilities, launching missile and air strikes on residential areas in Ukrainian cities and villages, torturing and murdering civilians.
