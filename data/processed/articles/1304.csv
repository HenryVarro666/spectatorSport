After meeting with European allies on Thursday in Brussels, Mr Biden told a press conference it was time to step up efforts to isolate Russia from the international community.

He said if G20 member countries blocked his request to remove Russia, then Ukraine should be invited to attend the meetings.

“The single most important thing is for us to stay unified and the world to continue to focus on what a brute this guy (Russian President Vladimir Putin) is and all the innocent people’s lives that will be lost and ruined and what’s going on,” Mr Biden told reporters.

He said he didn’t expect the sanctions to have an impact in the short term, but he expected in the months to come the sustained pressure would take a toll on Mr Putin’s ability to wage war.

“If you’re Putin and you think that Europe is going to crack in a month or six weeks or two months, why not. They can take anything for another month. But the reason I asked for the meeting, we have to stay fully, totally united,” Mr Biden said.

The president’s comments came after he met with the leaders of the 30 Nato countries and G7 partners in back-to-back meetings.

The countries presented a united front against Russia, issuing further sanctions against 300 members of its Parliament and discussing how they would counter the threat of a potential chemical or biological weapon attack.

The US also announced it would take in 100,000 Ukrainian refugees and donate $1bn in aid to help Europe deal with the surge of nearly 3 million refugees.

BRUSSELS, March 24 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden said he thinks Russia should be removed from the Group of Twenty (G20) major economies and the topic was raised during his meetings with world leaders in Brussels earlier on Thursday.

""My answer is yes, depends on the G20,"" Biden said, when asked if Russia should be removed from the group.

Biden also said if countries such as Indonesia and others do not agree with removing Russia, then in his view, Ukraine should be allowed to attend the meetings.

He also said, following a day of meeting with key allies here, that Russia should be expelled from the G-20 group of nations and that if the other G-20 nations didn’t support expelling Russia from the group, then he would make the case for Ukraine to be able to participate in the meetings.

""The single most important thing is for us to stay unified and the world to continue to focus on what a brute this guy [Russian President Vladimir Putin] is and all the innocent people’s lives that will be lost and ruined and what’s going on,"" Biden said during a news conference.

""If you’re Putin and you think that Europe is going to crack in a month or six weeks or two months, why not. They can take anything for another month. But the reason I asked for the meeting, we have to stay fully, totally united,"" Biden said.

The U.S. announced a package of new sanctions against Russia Thursday that would apply to more than 400 Russians and Russian entities, including the Duma and more than 300 of its members, along with more than 40 defense companies.

Biden said he didn’t anticipate any of the actions taken Thursday to have an effect on Putin’s behavior in the short term, pointing instead to the impact of sustained and coordinated pressure.

“Why I asked for this NATO meeting today is to be sure that after a month we will sustain what we’re doing, not just next month and the following month, but for the remainder of this entire year. That’s what will stop him,” Biden said.

One wild card in the U.S. efforts to economically pressure Russia is China's next move. Biden said he has made it clear to Chinese President Xi Jinping that there would be consequences if he were to help Russia, pointing to the companies that have left Russia since the invasion.

""I think that China understands that its economic future is much more closely tied to the West than it is to Russia,"" Biden said.

Biden attended an emergency gathering of NATO leaders Thursday, where a senior administration official described the mood as having been “sober, it’s been resolute and it’s been incredibly united.” The NATO summit was followed by a meeting with leaders of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations and an address to European Union leaders.

As the biggest conflict in Europe since World War II enters its second month, the discussions here stood to be among the most consequential of Biden’s presidency. While the U.S. rolled out new steps aimed at further harming the Russian economy and additional assistance for Ukrainian refugees, Biden made no new military commitments to Ukraine.

While Biden has committed $2 billion in military assistance to Ukraine, that country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, told NATO on Thursday that his nation still needs more military equipment, specifically tanks and fighter jets.

“You have at least 20,000 tanks. Ukraine asked for a percent, one percent of all your tanks to be given or sold to us,” Zelenskyy said in a speech to NATO. “But we do not have a clear answer yet. The worst thing during the war is not having clear answers to requests for help.”

One topic the leaders discussed Thursday was the possibility that Putin might use chemical or biological weapons, something Biden said earlier this week was a “real threat.” Biden declined to elaborate on what NATO would do should Putin use chemical weapons but said the response would be “in kind.”

The administration also announced plans to take additional steps to prevent Russia from attempting to prop up its economy, like making clear that any transactions involving gold related to the bank are prohibited and calling on corporations to no longer conduct their activities with Russia in a business-as-usual manner.

And the White House said it would allow as many as 100,000 Ukrainians to enter the U.S., with a focus on those who are most vulnerable. The administration is also prepared to offer more than $1 billion in additional funding toward humanitarian assistance and $11 billion over the next five years to address worldwide food security threats after the disruptions to the Russian and the Ukrainian agricultural industries.",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-says-allies-must-stay-united-russia-expel-g20-rcna21381

Driving the news: Biden said the decision would ultimately be up to the G20, but that he has proposed allowing Ukraine to attend as an observer nation if other members do not agree to remove Russia.

The big picture: Biden spoke after hours of meetings with the leaders of NATO and the G7, and ahead of the European Council summit where he's been invited as a guest.

Biden announced earlier in the day that the U.S. would provide $1 billion in humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, welcome up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, and impose sanctions on over 600 Russian lawmakers, elites and defense companies.

The G7 and EU also agreed on a new initiative to tighten sanctions enforcement, as well as cooperation on supporting third countries harmed by sanctions and disruptions to food and energy security.

Other highlights

Chemical weapons: Biden said NATO ""would respond"" if Russia used chemical, biological or nuclear weapons inside Ukraine, and that ""the nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use.""

Pressed further on whether NATO would respond militarily, Biden said ""we'd make that decision at the time.""

China: Biden said he made clear in his phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping last week that he would be putting himself in ""significant jeopardy"" if Beijing supported Russia militarily or with sanctions evasion.

He added that he believes China ""understands its economic future is much more closely tied to the West than it is to Russia.""

Food shortages: Biden warned that there is a real risk of global food shortages given Russia and Ukraine's role as the ""bread basket of Europe,"" and that the G7 and EU discussed ways to lift restrictions and other measures to alleviate those concerns.

Trump's return: Biden said it's ""not an illogical question"" for Europeans and other U.S. allies to ask whether Donald Trump could win back the White House in 2024, but quipped that he would feel ""very fortunate"" to have Trump as an opponent.",https://www.axios.com/biden-russia-g20-summit-d8fe5ce7-5986-4fc3-bb17-c5f4c17c3a10.html

Biden made the comments during a press conference Thursday in Brussels following a series of urgent NATO meetings on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The G-20, or Group of Twenty, is an intergovernmental forum of 19 countries and the European Union that works on major global issues. He said he raised the issue Thursday with other world leaders.

Biden said that he would prefer is removed from the group, but should Indonesia or other nations disagree, he would ask that Ukraine leaders be allowed in for conversations.

Biden and Western allies on Thursday pledged new sanctions and humanitarian aid in response to the continued assault in Ukraine by Russian President .

6,cd1fb4de-4c84-47c4-9fbe-ede5a7b3e3b4,['Nicholas Gordon'],,"Russian President Vladimir Putin is likely keeping his invitation to join the G20 Summit in Bali later this year, despite calls from the U.S. and others to bar him from the November meeting due to his invasion of Ukraine.

At a Thursday press conference, U.S. President Joe Biden said that he supports ejecting Russia from the G20, an informal grouping of some of the world’s largest developed and developing economies, though noted that Russia's exclusion ""depends on the [other] G20"" members agreeing to excommunicate Putin—which is unlikely.

In 2014—after Putin annexed Crimea—members of what was then the G8 agreed to exclude Russia from their meetings, going back to being the G7. At the time, Russia Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov downplayed the significance of Russia's eviction, saying the G8 ""does not give out any membership cards and, by its definition, cannot remove anyone.""

Australia, which hosted the G20 in 2014, threatened to push for Russia's removal from the larger economic summit that year, too. Ultimately Russia was allowed to join because the other G20 members had no consensus on excluding the country.

Now, once again, the G20 members are divided over the issue of whether Putin should be allowed to attend, or whether Ukraine should be invited too, as Biden has suggested. Putin's presence would be ""highly problematic"" for European members, one EU source told Reuters. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison called sitting with Putin in Bali ""a step too far"", and said he had talked directly with Indonesian president Joko Widodo on the subject.

On Tuesday, Poland said that it asked the U.S. to consider ejecting Russia from the G20—and allow Warsaw to claim Moscow’s seat. But it's unlikely the G20 will eject Russia from the organization, given that any decision on membership would likely need to be reached by all the members.

On Wednesday, Russia's ambassador to Indonesia, Lyudmila Vorobieva, said that Putin would attend the summit, and that Russia wanted the G20 to focus on ""economic problems."" China has backed Russia’s continued presence in the G20, calling it an “important member”.

Story continues

“No member has the right to remove another country as a member,” said Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin at a news briefing on Wednesday. China had earlier asked Indonesia to keep Ukraine off the G20's agenda.

The issue also puts pressure on Indonesia, the current president of the G20 and host of this year's summit, to be held in Bali this October. On Thursday, Indonesia said it would ""remain impartial"" and affirmed that it would invite Russia to the G20 summit.

The G20 is an informal organization of twenty advanced and developing countries that largely corresponds to the world’s largest economies, with a few concessions made to ensure geographical diversity.

The first summit of G20 heads of state was held in November 2008 in Washington D.C. as a way to coordinate a global policy response to the Global Financial Crisis. Since then, the yearly. summit has become a platform for discussing cooperation on global issues like macroeconomic stability and climate change.

At the last G20 Summit, held in Rome, leaders agreed to set a minimum corporate tax rate of 15%, and stop funding overseas coal projects. Putin did not attend the Rome summit in-person, joining via video.

The G-7 leaders and the European Union also announced an initiative focused on blocking the evasion of sanctions on Russia, as well as efforts to blunt Russia's central bank from being able to deploy international reserves, including gold

""Today, the United States is announcing that we are prepared to provide more than $1 billion in new funding towards humanitarian assistance for those affected by Russia’s war in Ukraine and its severe impacts around the world, including a marked rise in food insecurity, over the coming months,"" the White House wrote in a statement. ""This funding will provide food, shelter, clean water, medical supplies and other forms of assistance. We are also announcing an additional $320 million in democracy and human rights funding to Ukraine and its neighbors.""

Already, 3.6 million people have fled the country, with another 6.5 million more internally displaced, according to the United Nations, the worst refugee crisis since World War II.

""While we expect many Ukrainians will choose to remain in Europe close to family and their homes in Ukraine, today, the United States is announcing plans to welcome up to 100,000 Ukrainians and others fleeing Russia’s aggression through the full range of legal pathways, including the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program,"" the White House wrote in a statement.

""In particular, we are working to expand and develop new programs with a focus on welcoming Ukrainians who have family members in the United States,"" the administration continued. ""The United States and the European Union are also coordinating closely to ensure that these efforts, and other forms of humanitarian admission or transfers, are complementary and provide much-needed support to Ukraine’s neighbors.""

The White House has been saying for weeks that the U.S. would accept refugees from Ukraine, but officials had expected most would want to remain in Europe to stay close to their homeland or to family members around Eastern Europe.

In terms of sanctions, the White House announced new punishments on more than 400 entities in Russia, including:

328 Duma members and sanctioning the Duma as an entity;

Herman Gref, the head of Russia’s largest financial institution Sberbank and a Putin advisor since the 1990s.

Russian elite Gennady Timchenko, his companies and his family members;

17 board members of Russian financial institution Sovcombank;

48 Large Russian defense state-owned enterprises that are part of Russia’s defense-industrial base and produce weapons that have been used in Russia’s assault against Ukraine’s people, infrastructure, and territory, including Russian Helicopters, Tactical Missiles Corporation, High Precision Systems, NPK Tekhmash OAO, Kronshtadt

""We are targeting, and will continue to target, the suppliers of Russia’s war effort and, in turn, their supply chain,"" the White House said of targeting Russian defense companies.

At a press conference on Thursday, President Joe Biden said that temporary sanctions will not stop Putin from continuing his siege on Ukraine, but long-term penalties on Russian finances, exports and elites could pressure the country enough.

Biden said a core reason why he traveled to Brussels was to affirm unity among NATO allies and make sure that sanctions can be maintained on Russia.

“The maintenance of sanctions, increasing the pain — and the demonstration of why I asked for this NATO meeting today — is to be sure that after a month we will sustain what we're doing. Not just next month, the following month, but for the remainder of this entire year,” he said.

“That’s what will stop him.”

The president said NATO leaders must stay banded together to have a chance at stopping the war in Ukraine.

“The single most important thing is for us to stay unified and for the world to continue to focus on what a brute this guy is, and all the innocent people's lives that are being lost and ruined,” he said.

“If you're Putin, and you think that Europe is going to crack in a month or six weeks or two months, why not?” he added. “They can take anything for another month. But we have to demonstrate — the reason I asked for the meeting — we have to stay fully, totally, thoroughly united.”

Biden on Thursday also said he thinks Russia should be expelled from the G20 group — a consortium of 19 countries and the European Union representing the world’s largest economies.

“My answer is yes. That depends on the G20,” he said, noting the issue was raised among leaders in Brussels earlier Thursday.

If other G20 countries or the Indonesian officials who lead the G20 do not allow it, he added, he believes Ukraine should be able to attend the group’s meetings.

Russia was expelled from the separate G8 in 2014 because of its annexation of Crimea, which is how the group reverted to the G7.

The G7 leaders and the European Union also announced Thursday an initiative focused on blocking the evasion of sanctions on Russia, as well as efforts to blunt Russia's central bank from being able to deploy international reserves, including gold.

""Together, we will not allow sanctions evasion or backfilling,"" the White House wrote.

""Our sanctions on Russia are unprecedented — in no other circumstance have we moved so swiftly and in such a coordinated fashion to impose devastating costs on any other country,"" the White House wrote. ""The ruble has depreciated substantially, and is expected by markets to weaken further. The Moscow Stock Exchange closed for weeks. The Central Bank of the Russian Federation has doubled interest rates to 20 percent and companies are being forced to turn over foreign exchange for rubles to provide the Russian Government hard currency. The economy is forecast to contract as much as 15 percent or more in 2022.""

""This economic collapse of Russia’s GDP will wipe out the past 15 years of economic gains in Russia, according to the Institute for International Finance,"" the Biden administration continued. ""Inflation in Russia is already spiking, with analysts projecting it to rise up to 15 percent on a year-over-year basis, and the Russian Government has been downgraded to “junk” status by major credit rating agencies. More than 400 multinational companies have left Russia in a mass exodus by the private sector.""

""As long as President Putin continues this war, the United States and allies and partners are committed to ensuring the Russian government feels the compounding effects of our current and future economic actions,"" the Biden administration added.

The White House announced the initiatives as President Biden and world leaders gathered in Brussels for a trio of summits in response to the Russian invasion, seeking new ways to limit the economic and security fallout from the conflict.

Biden detailed the events of Thursday's extraordinary NATO Summit to discuss Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which took place on the one month anniversary of Russia's incursion.

""NATO leaders met today on the one-month anniversary of Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine to reiterate our strong support for the Ukrainian people, our determination to hold Russia accountable for its brutal war, and our commitment to strengthening the NATO Alliance,"" Biden wrote.

""We had the privilege of hearing directly from President Zelenskyy, and we will continue to support him and his government with significant, and increasing, amounts of security assistance to fight Russian aggression and uphold their right to self-defense,"" he added.

Zelenskyy pleaded with NATO leaders for more military aid, calling for ""military assistance without limitations,"" saying that Russia is ""using its entire arsenal.""

Zelenskyy urged NATO to provide Ukraine with “1% of all your planes, 1% of all your tanks.”

“We can’t just buy those,” he said said. “When we will have all this, it will give us, just like you, 100% security.”

Ukraine is also in dire need of multiple launch rocket systems, anti-ship weapons and air defense systems, Zelenskyy said, asking: “Is it possible to survive in such a war without this?""

“It feels like we’re in a gray area, between the West and Russia, defending our common values,” Zelenskyy said. “This is the scariest thing during a war – not to have clear answers to requests for help.”

""NATO has yet to show what the Alliance can do to save people,"" Zelenskyy said. ""To show that this is truly the most powerful defense union in the world. And the world is waiting. And Ukraine is very much waiting. Waiting for real actions. Real security guarantees.""

""In the past few weeks, the United States has announced $1 billion in new security assistance to Ukraine — anti-aircraft systems, anti-armor weapons, drones, and millions of rounds of ammunition,"" Biden wrote in his statement. ""I welcome the steps by many other Allies to provide defensive support to Ukraine and together, we are committed to identifying additional equipment, including air defense systems, to help Ukraine.""

Biden said the leaders also discussed their ""work to bolster NATO’s collective defense, particularly on the Eastern flank,"" citing their joint statement released Thursday as evidence that the alliance is ""as strong and united as it has ever been.""

""The United States has surged thousands of forces and additional capabilities to Europe, and we have welcomed the new deployments made by our Allies,"" Biden wrote. ""Today’s establishment of four new battle groups in Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary is a strong signal that we will collectively defend and protect every inch of NATO territory.""

""Between now and the NATO summit in June, we will develop plans for additional forces and capabilities to strengthen NATO’s defenses,"" the president concluded. ""We will adopt an updated Strategic Concept to ensure NATO is ready to meet any challenge in the new and more dangerous security environment.""",https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2022/03/24/president-joe-biden--western-allies-open-1st-of-3-summits-on-russian-war
