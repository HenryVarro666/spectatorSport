Boris Johnson said western allies “will agree a massive package of economic sanctions designed in time to hobble the Russian economy” – expected to be outlined to House of Commons at 5pm on Thursday.

But Davis said that even the most “ferocious sanctions … are no longer a deterrent, they are a punishment” and that the invasion of Ukraine meant Vladimir Putin had “effectively declared war on the west”.

Davis tweeted: “Therefore if we do not provide military support, more than 40 million Ukrainians will go from living in a democracy to living under a brutal dictatorship.

“It is far too late to get boots on the ground, but it is not too late to provide air support to the Ukrainian army, which may neutralise Putin’s overwhelming armoured superiority.”

Davis said the air support should be confined to the airspace over Ukraine, and based on a request from Ukraine’s president, saying this “should be perfectly legal under almost any interpretation of international law”.

He added: “There are no zero-risk options. If we do not act militarily, then Nato will be significantly weakened and we must fear for the safety of every state that borders Russia.”

Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the defence select committee, said a Nato division should have been stationed in Ukraine as a deterrent. Ukraine is not a Nato member, but has requested membership.

“If Kyiv falls, history will ask why the west didn’t do more?” Ellwood told the BBC.

“Six months ago I called for a division, a Nato division, to be moved into Ukraine. That is what Ukrainians were requesting, and that would have deterred this invasion.

“That would have been enough to make Putin think twice. But we didn’t do that, we actually did the opposite. We declared that we would not send any Nato troops into Ukraine. We parked that away.”

The former minister Stephen Hammond also called for the UK to consider using further military deterrent. “We must stand with Ukraine at this time of continental crisisand ensure Russian aggression does not go unpunished. We must work with our allies to impose tougher sanctions and a no-fly zone,” he said.

Russia has significant advantages in air power: its total air force has 1,172 combat aircraft against Ukraine’s 124, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies thinktank.

Ukraine has sought to modernise its military over the past year, receiving Javelin anti-tank missiles from the US, shorter range anti-tank weapons from the UK and a small number of TB2 drones from Turkey. However, the bulk of its equipment dates back to the Soviet era and will be familiar to Russian generals.

Alicia Kearns, a Conservative MP and former senior communications officer at the Ministry of Defence, said Britain providing defensive support in Ukrainian airspace should be “on the table and under discussion”.

She said this would not be a move taken lightly, as it could mean Russia “shooting British airmen and women out of the sky”.

Kearns said the move would be contingent on “meaningful intelligence” suggesting it would “be effective” at curtailing the Russian advance.

“We know that Putin has a lot of anti-aircraft ground-to-air missiles,” she said. “He might not have any qualms about taking out British troops. If we went in, it would have to be with other Nato allies – a great number.

“The alternative is, of course, the UK could put anti-aircraft missiles in neighbouring countries, but that also runs the risk of taking us into overt war with Russia.

Kearns added it was “too late to put boots on the ground” but that if Russian troops continued their advance on Kyiv, the UK should consider cyberstrikes on the Kremlin and state firms “within the week”. She also suggested Turkey should be encouraged to deny the Russian navy passage through the Bosphorus straits, a key access point between the Black Sea and Mediterranean.

Tom Tugendhat, the chair of the foreign affairs select committee, said weak sanctions such as those announced on Monday “just encourage others to believe we are weak because we’re clearly not willing to do anything serious.

“So what that did, I’m afraid, on Monday was it didn’t deter but encouraged, because it gave the suggestion or made clear that we weren’t wiling to do anything serious.

“If we are going to do sanctions, as I say, we need to do them extremely hard and extremely early.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/conservative-mps-urge-increase-uk-military-aid-ukraine-russia

Later, in a intelligence update posted to its Twitter account on Friday afternoon, the Ministry of Defence said that fighting ""continues in key locations"".

""Russia has made limited progress so far today and Ukraine retains control of key cities,"" the MoD said.

In a further update, the MoD said that Russian forces had opened up a new route of advance towards Ukrainian capital Kyiv, having failed to capture Chernihiv, a city 150km to the north west.

""The bulk of Russian forces advancing on Kyiv remain more than 50km from the centre of the city,"" the MoD added.

PM to speak with NATO leaders

Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday hit Russia with what he described as the ""largest set of sanctions ever imposed anywhere by the UK government"", after the attack on Ukraine.

He spoke with leaders of the Joint Expeditionary Force today - made up of the UK, Denmark, Finland, Estonia, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Sweden and Norway - and will also join a virtual meeting of NATO leaders at 2pm.

On Friday morning, Mr Johnson spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

""President Zelenskyy updated the PM on the most recent Russian military advances, including missile and artillery strikes on Ukrainian cities and the terrible developments in Kyiv in the early hours of this morning,"" a Downing Street spokesperson said.

""The PM assured President Zelenskyy that the world is united in its horror at what Putin his doing.

""He paid tribute to the bravery and heroism of the Ukrainian people in standing up to Russia's campaign of violence, and expressed his deep condolences for those who have been killed.""

Posting on Twitter after his call with Mr Johnson, Mr Zelenskyy said his country needed ""the support of partners more than ever"".

""We demand effective counteraction to the Russian Federation,"" he added. ""Sanctions must be further strengthened.""

Downing Street said the PM was expected to raise the prospect of banning Russia from the Swift international payment system in the meeting with NATO allies, amid reports of a reluctance among some European nations to take such action.

Number 10 said ""nothing is off the table"" in support of Ukraine.

Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow would be ready to hold talks with Kyiv but only once Ukraine's military had laid down its arms.

He also said the Kremlin did not want ""neo-Nazis"" to govern Ukraine.

The Belarusian ambassador was summoned to the Foreign Office on Friday afternoon, a day after the Russian ambassador was handed a dressing-down by Foreign Secretary Liz Truss.

Belarus is an ally of Russia and the two countries recently conducted joint military drills ahead of the invasion of Ukraine.

Russian troops entered north Ukraine on Thursday from across the Belarus border.

After the summons, Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said: ""The UK condemns the role Belarus is playing in the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

""Belarus must stop supporting Russia's illegal and unprovoked actions. We must be united against Russian aggression.""

Mr Cleverly told the ambassador that UK sanctions on Russia would also apply to Belarusian individuals, entities and organisations who have aided and abetted the invasion of Ukraine.

Minister pushes back at calls for no-fly zone over Ukraine

Appearing in the House of Commons on Friday, armed forces minister James Heappey pushed back at calls from MPs for a no-fly zone to be enforced over Ukraine.

He warned that it could trigger a wider conflict between NATO countries and Russia under the alliance's Article 5 mutual defence clause.

""We need to have our eyes wide open to the reality that in such an event, NATO jets would not possibly but would most certainly probably come into a combat situation with Russian jets,"" Mr Heappey told MPs.

""And the risk of miscalculation and escalation and the triggering of Article 5 could not be understated in those circumstances.""

Mr Heappey said, for operational reasons, he could not specify exactly what extra military support the UK would supply to Ukraine.

But he reassured MPs the government wanted to see ""as much British kit in hands of Ukrainians as we can manage"".

The minister said military officers had been instructed to ""look across the full UK inventory for everything we have right now and look at what might be usable in the circumstances"".

Mr Heappey said anti-tank missiles had ""already proven to be invaluable"" in the conflict in Ukraine, with unsubstantiated reports they had ""been used to defeat Russian armour"".

He also told MPs that a total of 1,000 UK troops are on stand-by to support Ukraine's neighbours with a likely influx of refugees.

Putin compared to Hitler

Russia's aggression against Ukraine came despite a recent flurry of diplomatic activity to try and persuade Mr Putin to withdraw his forces from Ukraine's borders.

But, speaking to Sky News, Mr Wallace dismissed the suggestion that Western nations had failed in their efforts to avert a conflict.

The defence secretary used a newspaper interview earlier this month to suggest there was a ""whiff of Munich"" about the Ukraine crisis.

Explaining those comments, he said: ""It wasn't the bit about appeasement I was referring to, I was referring that in Munich in 1938, Adolf Hitler all along had a plan to invade parts of Europe.

""And all the diplomacy was about a straw man attempt by him to buy time. Putin has been set on this for many, many months and certainly over a year.

""It doesn't matter how much effort we made, and we all made unbelievable efforts... it didn't matter.""

Mr Wallace accused Moscow of acting on a ""greed to subsume Ukraine into the Russian Federation, or indeed for President Putin to land-grab"".

Mr Wallace said that Mr Putin had ""clearly broken international law"" with his actions over Ukraine.

""He's occupying or trying to occupy a sovereign country who made one mistake in his eyes,"" he said.

""Their mistake in his eyes was not to choose the Kremlin as a way for their future. And that's all they have done.""

Mr Wallace, who was this week overheard claiming Mr Putin had gone ""full tonto"" over Ukraine, added: ""Putin didn't need to do this, he didn't need to occupy - which he's doing right now - a sovereign country.

""None of it stacked up, none of the reasons why he would do it stacked up.

""A few of us felt that - and I made a few comments the other day about President Putin - he's not doing something that's logical.

""He's doing something that is about his ego and his legacy.""

In another broadcast interview, Mr Wallace suggested Mr Putin could turn his aim on the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia after Ukraine.

""He won't stop... He will use everything in the Baltic states. He doesn't believe the Baltic states are really countries,"" the defence secretary told BBC Radio 4.

Labour calls for government to 'go further' on sanctions

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he wanted the government to ""go even further"" than the latest package of sanctions.

""In the past we have not been strong enough in response to Putin,"" Sir Keir told Sky News.

""That has given him the idea that the benefits of his aggression outweigh the costs.

""We cannot allow that to happen again. The package we put in now must be enough not just to isolate Russia but to cripple its ability to function.""",https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-crisis-russia-has-failed-to-take-any-of-its-major-objectives-and-has-lost-450-personnel-defence-secretary-ben-wallace-says-12550928

UK will provide 6,000 new defensive missiles and £25m for Ukraine’s armed forces

Leaders meeting in Brussels are expected to discuss longer-term military, diplomatic and humanitarian support for Ukraine and strengthening measures against Russia

The Prime Minister will announce a major new package of support for Ukraine today at the NATO and G7 leaders’ meetings, as he calls on the international community to stay the course on Ukraine and stand against tyranny.

The measures announced today include 6,000 missiles, consisting of anti-tank and high explosive weapons, and £25 million in financial backing for the Ukrainian military. This more than doubles the defensive lethal aid provided to date to more than 10,000 missiles, and comes on top of the £400 million the UK has committed in humanitarian and economic aid for the crisis. The Prime Minister will set out the UK’s intention to work with partners to bolster Ukraine’s defence capabilities, including longer-range targeting and intelligence, as the Ukrainian people face down an unprovoked invasion.

The UK will also provide an additional £4.1 million for the BBC World Service as part of a cross-government effort to tackle disinformation in Russia and Ukraine, as well as new financial and policing support for the International Criminal Court’s investigation into war crimes.

One month into the conflict, the Prime Minister will welcome NATO and the G7’s unified stance on Ukraine and collective action on economic, military and diplomatic measures. He will urge Allies and partners to step up a gear in response to Russia’s use of increasingly brutal tactics, including by providing enhanced defensive support to Ukraine and doubling down on economic sanctions against the Kremlin.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:

Vladimir Putin is already failing in Ukraine. The Ukrainian people have shown themselves to be extraordinarily brave and tenacious in defending their homeland, in the face of an unprovoked onslaught. But we cannot and will not stand by while Russia grinds Ukraine’s towns and cities into dust. The United Kingdom will work with our allies to step up military and economic support to Ukraine, strengthening their defences as they turn the tide in this fight. One month into this crisis, the international community faces a choice. We can keep the flame of freedom alive in Ukraine, or risk it being snuffed out across Europe and the world.

The UK has already provided over 4,000 anti-tank weapons to Ukraine’s armed forces, including Next-Generation Light Anti-Tank Weapons Systems, or NLAWs, and Javelin missiles. The Government is also supplying Starstreak high-velocity anti-air missiles to help Ukrainians defend themselves against aerial bombings, as well as body armour, helmets and combat boots.

The £25 million in new non-ODA funding from the Conflict, Stability and Security Fund will help to pay the salaries of Ukrainian soldiers, pilots and police and ensure the armed forces are well equipped with high-quality equipment. The UK has committed £400 million in humanitarian and economic support to date, complementing the huge generosity of the British public, and donated more than 4 million items of medical equipment and 500 mobile generators.

In further support announced today, the BBC World Service will receive an additional £4.1 million in emergency funding to support its Ukrainian and Russian language services in the region, and to help it create content to counter disinformation about the war in Ukraine. The funding has been provided by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport and FCDO.

The Justice Secretary, Dominic Raab, will also chair a meeting of justice and foreign ministers in the Hague today to coordinate support for the International Criminal Court’s war crimes investigations. The Deputy Prime Minister is expected to announce an additional £1 million in funding for the court, as well as new support from UK soldiers with expertise in intelligence gathering and the Met Police’s War Crimes Team.",https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-announces-major-new-military-support-package-for-ukraine-24-march-2022

Secretary of State for Health and Social Care and Foreign Secretary affirm UK’s commitment to stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine

The UK has now donated to Ukraine 5.29 million items of medical supplies to help the country cope with the medical emergency caused by the Russian invasion, helping to save tens of thousands of Ukrainian lives.

The 13th flight carrying items including ventilators and other medical supplies following an urgent request from Ukraine left Birmingham airport this morning (Thursday 31 March) destined for Poland, from where the items will be transported to sites across Ukraine.

The flights have left from Stansted, Birmingham and Heathrow airports and RAF Brize Norton over the last month, carrying items including lifesaving medicines, intensive care equipment and wound packs donated by NHS England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

On Wednesday, the 12th flight left from Heathrow airport carrying hundreds of thousands of items and medicines critical for surgery and healthcare, including adrenaline, tourniquets and cannulas.

The UK government has been working closely with Ukrainian officials to deliver targeted support to ensure medical items are reaching the people who need them most, including Kyiv and Lyiv.

Health and Social Care Secretary, Sajid Javid, said:

The appalling atrocities inflicted on the Ukrainians by Putin’s evil attacks are causing untold misery to millions of people. The invasion has created a medical emergency and the UK has acted swiftly to give our Ukrainian friends the medical support they need which has helped save tens of thousands of lives. The UK will continue to stand with the remarkable people of Ukraine in the face of Russia’s horrendous invasion.

The 5 million milestone of medical items donated to Ukraine forms part of the government’s wider humanitarian response to this emergency.

Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss, said:

The UK is continuing to play a leading role in the response to Russia’s unprovoked attacks on the Ukrainian people, with UK aid supplies flowing into Ukraine and its border regions. From medicines and equipment, to food, generators, blankets and hygiene kits, we are working with the government of Ukraine, our trusted humanitarian partners and friends in the region to help those most in need.

Some of the significant items sent to the Ukraine so far include:

nearly 3,000 adult resuscitators

around 220,000 wound care packs

over 550,000 sterile needles

over 50,000 packs of bandages

1,600 pieces of equipment for ventilators

over 75,000 cannulas

around 380,000 packs of medicines – around 2.8 million doses – including antibiotics and painkillers

72,000 packs of gloves

28,000 FFP3 masks

On Tuesday, 3 trucks left for the region carrying wound care packs, syringes and bandages. A further truck left on Wednesday afternoon.

Medical aid donations have formed just part of the wider ongoing support from the UK government. Earlier this month 21 Ukrainian children with cancer were flown to the UK, all of whom are receiving lifesaving treatment from the NHS. The government also announced that Ukrainians fleeing their home country will be guaranteed free access to NHS healthcare, including hospital services, GP and nurse consultations, urgent care centres and injury units.

As of Tuesday 29 March, 22,100 visas have been granted through the Ukraine Family Scheme and, for those with valid Ukrainian passports, the government has removed the need to attend an in-person appointment to conduct biometric checks before travelling to the UK.

Since the Homes for Ukraine scheme launched on Monday 14 March more than 150,000 people have expressed interest in being sponsors.

Will Britons be prosecuted for going to Ukraine to fight Russian troops? The Foreign Office has told Britons: ""If you travel to Ukraine to fight, or to assist others engaged in the conflict, your activities may amount to offences against UK legislation and you could be prosecuted on your return to the UK.""

The Foreign Enlistment Act of 1870 bans Britons from fighting in the 'military or naval service of any foreign state' that is at war with a country the UK is 'at peace' with.

As of 11 February, the Foreign Office has advised Britons against all travel to the whole of Ukraine and has urged British nationals to leave the war-torn country.

The British Army has said all service personnel are banned from travelling to Ukraine.

The Metropolitan Police have reportedly warned officers they will face disciplinary action if they travel to Ukraine to help fight the invading Russian army.

There have been questions about the legality of Britons going abroad to fight in previous foreign conflicts.

In 2014, the Crown Prosecution Service warned that UK nationals who went to fight in the Syrian civil war could be committing an offence, even if they joined the rebels fighting to overthrow President Bashar Assad.

That's up from an estimate of one-third provided by the same official on Friday. Russia is believed to have amassed 190,000 troops in the vicinity of Ukraine. The U.S. Defense official declined to elaborate on the rest of Russia's force posture, but said the Russians' ""momentum continues to be slowed predominantly from a stiff Ukrainian resistance.""

We stand ready to support with humanitarian assistance in order to mitigate the suffering, including for refugees and displaced persons from the Russian aggression.

We call on the Russian Federation to stop the bloodshed, to immediately de-escalate and to withdraw its forces from Ukraine. We also call on Russia to ensure the safety of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission. We also condemn the involvement of Belarus in this aggression against Ukraine and call on Belarus to abide by its international obligations.

We condemn in the strongest possible terms Russian President Putin's decision on February 21 to recognise the Donetsk and Luhansk self-declared entities in eastern Ukraine as ""independent"" states as well as his decision to send Russian military forces into these regions. We call on other states not to follow Russia's illegal decision to recognise the proclaimed independence of these entities. The decision by President Putin is a grave violation of the basic principles enshrined in the UN Charter, in particular the respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of states and also a blatant breach of UN Security Council resolution 2202 – supported by the Russian Federation as a permanent member of the Security Council – as well as of the Minsk agreements, which stipulate the return of the areas concerned to the control of the Ukrainian Government.

We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders and territorial waters as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future and security arrangements. We reaffirm that illegally occupied Crimea and the self-declared ""people's republics"" are an integral part of Ukraine.

We condemn President Putin for his consistent refusal to engage in a diplomatic process to address questions pertaining to European security, despite our repeated offers. We stand united with partners, including NATO, the EU and their member states as well as Ukraine and remain determined to do what is necessary to preserve the integrity of the rules-based international order. In this regard, we are also closely monitoring global oil and gas market conditions, including in the context of Russia's further military aggression against Ukraine. We support consistent and constructive engagement and coordination among major energy producers and consumers toward our collective interest in the stability of global energy supplies, and stand ready to act as needed to address potential disruptions.",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/24/ukraine-russia-news-vladimir-putin-orders-attack-as-explosions-are-reported.html
