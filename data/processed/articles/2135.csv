KYIV, Ukraine — By midmorning, there was little left outside the shopping mall beyond rubble, blood stains and broken glass. On one side, the building had been reduced to a pile of debris. On the other lay remnants left by several victims — including their clothes. Used surgical gloves were scattered on the ground nearby.

The missile that struck the Retroville shopping complex late Sunday night killed at least eight people, officials here said, the latest violent attack on the capital in the past week that have left residents fearing what might come next. The devastation at the mall on Monday was some of the worst seen in Kyiv since the war began, and concern is mounting that Russia’s frustration over its failure to seize key territory could prompt its forces to escalate its attacks.

Civilians milled about outside the next morning to survey the damage, well aware that the unpredictable nature of the assault meant those who died here just hours before could just as easily have been them.

“The whole city is dangerous,” said Vitaliya Dubovetska, who lives on the 16th floor of an apartment building nearby and saw the strike from her window. “Any place could be safe or unsafe. It’s like a lottery.” Photos on her phone showed an orange fireball erupting in the distance. She moved closer to the strike site on Monday to repair the windows at a relative’s apartment across the street and then visited what remained of the mall.

Dubovetska and others said the attack occurred around 11 p.m. on Sunday, causing an enormous boom that rippled through the area. Due to a citywide curfew from 8 p.m. each night, journalists could not reach the scene until morning. It was not immediately clear who was killed in the attack, which took place at a time when most civilians would not be allowed outside their homes or shelters.

Just inside the damaged mall sat a grocery store that one former employee said was now being used for storage. Shards of glass and a large puddle of water sat in the hall. The ceiling was also damaged.

Troops guarding the door initially allowed a group of journalists to enter but then forced the press corps to leave. Vladyslov Kosiak, 21, stood across the street with two friends. They, too, had heard the strike the night before from a fourth-floor balcony nearby, then came to see the damage after the curfew lifted Monday morning.

“There was a very loud bang and the building started to shake like an earthquake,” Kosiak said. Throughout the morning, the heavy report of outgoing artillery could be heard.

A territorial defense volunteer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk freely, said the strike was the result of a hypersonic missile — but did not offer any evidence. “Maybe it was to show the Ukrainian military what they can do, that they can damage anything,” he said.

Booms echoed continuously throughout the area Monday morning. When asked if one loud blast was incoming or outgoing, the territorial defense member shrugged. “I don’t know, but it’s not here,” he said, and laughed as he gestured to his immediate surroundings. “So it’s okay.”

The attack Sunday came as Russia insisted Ukraine surrender the besieged city of Mariupol. Weeks of attacks on the port have created a deadly humanitarian disaster. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky refused. Civilians in Kyiv said Monday that his defiance left them feeling proud despite their horror over the events unfolding within their borders.

Most communication to Mariupol has been cut off since the beginning of March, but some civilians have managed to flee. They have brought with them stories of hellish conditions, including mass graves and bodies left in the streets. Two Associated Press journalists stayed in the city for weeks, documenting the horrors firsthand and helping the world understand the gravity of Russia’s attack, which has allegedly included strikes on a theater, an art school and a maternity hospital.

“If he would agree to give them Mariupol, tomorrow it would be Kharkiv. It’s better not to negotiate,” said Natalia, 44, who worked at the grocery store inside the mall before the war started. She spoke on the condition that only her first name be used due to security concerns. She, too, visited the site Monday to assess the damage.

“From the beginning,” she said, “Russian soldiers thought we in Kyiv would meet them with a flower in our hands. But if they come, we will each give them two,” a reference to the tradition of leaving flowers by a grave.

Her friend Oksana works in a food store next to where the strike occurred. She said the attacks on civilian infrastructure have only bolstered the civilians’ resolve to stand their ground. “We will never let the Russian army come to Kyiv,” she said. She had decided to stay in the capital out of a sense of patriotic duty. “It’s better to die in an apartment here than to try to live somewhere else.”

Still, residents worry the growing assault could make living here unbearable. Already, they are fearful and anxious — but keep pressing forward in hopes the situation will resolve.

“Every day I wake up to have breakfast and don’t know if I will be alive for dinner,” Natalia said.

Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, was awakened by explosions in the early hours of Friday morning local time, CNN reported.

""Strikes on Kyiv with cruise or ballistic missiles continued,"" Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Ukraine, told CNN.

The outlet said its reporters had heard two blasts in central Kyiv and another explosion in the distance.

It wasn't immediately clear how many people had been injured or how much damage the city had sustained.

Social-media users in Kyiv posted videos showing the sky lit up with explosions.

One user showed that what appeared to be an apartment building had been set ablaze.

The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, reported that the building fire injured three people — one of whom was said to be in critical condition.

The Biden administration told House lawmakers during a Thursday briefing that it believed Russian forces were intending to surround Kyiv — home to 3 million people — before capturing it, CNN reported.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday called himself Russia's ""No. 1 target"" but said, ""I stay in the capital, I stay with my people.""

""They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state,"" Zelensky added. ""We also have information that enemy sabotage groups have entered Kyiv. That's why I am asking Kyivites very much: Be careful, follow the rules of curfew.""

On Thursday, some Ukrainians took refuge in the subways for safety from attacks.

Russian forces invaded Ukraine on Thursday in what Russian President Vladimir Putin called a ""special military operation"" — essentially declaring war on the country early Thursday morning. Ukraine says more than 100 Ukrainians have been killed in the conflict so far.

The United Nations estimated Thursday evening that more than 100,000 people had been displaced within Ukraine.

Former and current Ukrainian diplomats condemned the Russian attacks, comparing them to World War II.

""Russia, the sin is on you. Shame is indelible,"" Olexander Scherba, Ukraine's former ambassador to Austria, tweeted. ""They say that you will bomb Kiev at 4 o'clock in Kiev. Well, you are true to tradition. Hitler was bombing at the same time.""

Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's minister of foreign affairs, urged the West to ""sever all ties"" with Russia.

""Horrific Russian rocket strikes on Kyiv,"" Kuleba said on Twitter. ""Last time our capital experienced anything like this was in 1941 when it was attacked by Nazi Germany. Ukraine defeated that evil and will defeat this one. Stop Putin. Isolate Russia.""

Mykhailo Podoliak, an advisor to Zelensky, argued, ""Just like in 1941, now the attacker can only get the hatred of the people and nothing more,"" according to The Kyiv Independent.",https://www.businessinsider.com/ukraine-capital-kyiv-attacked-missiles-2022-2
4,5be30176-5455-4697-8840-8d33f6042b10,"['Yuras Karmanau', 'Associated Press', 'Jim Heintz', 'Vladimir Isachenkov', 'Zeke Miller']",2022-02-26 21:42:42-04:00,"KYIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian forces put up fierce resistance to slow the advance of the larger and more powerful Russian military closing in on the capital, as the U.S. and EU rushed ammunition and weapons to Kyiv and announced powerful new financial sanctions aimed at further isolating Moscow.

Terrified men, women and children sought safety inside and underground, and the government maintained a 39-hour curfew to keep people off the streets. More than 150,000 Ukrainians fled for Poland, Moldova and other neighboring countries, and the United Nations warned the number could grow to 4 million if fighting escalates.

Huge explosions lit up the predawn sky south of Kyiv early Sunday. President Volodymyr Zelensky’s office said one of the blasts was near the Zhuliany airport, and the mayor of Vasylkiv, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of the capital, said an oil depot was hit.

Zelensky’s office also said Russian forces blew up a gas pipeline in Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city. The government warned that smoke from the huge explosion could cause an “environmental catastrophe” and advised people to cover their windows with damp cloth or gauze.

“We will fight for as long as needed to liberate our country,” Zelensky vowed.

President Vladimir Putin hasn’t disclosed his ultimate plans, but Western officials believe he is determined to overthrow Ukraine’s government and replace it with a regime of his own, redrawing the map of Europe and reviving Moscow’s Cold War-era influence.

To aid Ukraine’s ability to hold out, the U.S. pledged an additional $350 million in military assistance to Ukraine, including anti-tank weapons, body armor and small arms. Germany said it would send missiles and anti-tank weapons to the besieged country and that it would close its airspace to Russian planes.

The U.S., European Union and United Kingdom agreed to block “selected” Russian banks from the SWIFT global financial messaging system, which moves money around more than 11,000 banks and other financial institutions worldwide, part of a new round of sanctions aiming to impose a severe cost on Moscow for the invasion. They also agreed to impose ”restrictive measures” on Russia’s central bank.

It was unclear how much territory Russian forces had seized or to what extent their advance had been stalled. Britain’s Ministry of Defense said “the speed of the Russian advance has temporarily slowed likely as a result of acute logistical difficulties and strong Ukrainian resistance.”

A senior U.S. defense official said more than half the Russian combat power that was massed along Ukraine’s borders has entered the country and Moscow has had to commit more fuel supply and other support units inside Ukraine than originally anticipated. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal U.S. assessments.

The curfew forcing everyone in Kyiv inside was set to last through Monday morning. The relative quiet of the capital was sporadically broken by gunfire.

Fighting on the city’s outskirts suggested that small Russian units were trying to clear a path for the main forces. Small groups of Russian troops were reported inside Kyiv, but Britain and the U.S. said the bulk of the forces were 19 miles (30 kilometers) from the city’s center as of the afternoon.

Russia claims its assault on Ukraine from the north, east and south is aimed only at military targets, but bridges, schools and residential neighborhoods have been hit.

Ukraine’s health minister reported Saturday that 198 people, including three children, had been killed and more than 1,000 others wounded during Europe’s largest land war since World War II. It was unclear whether those figures included both military and civilian casualties.

A missile struck a high-rise apartment building in Kyiv’s southwestern outskirts near one of the city’s two passenger airports, leaving a jagged hole of ravaged apartments over several floors. A rescue worker said six civilians were injured.

Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, said troops in Kyiv were fighting Russian “sabotage groups.” Ukraine says some 200 Russian soldiers have been captured and thousands killed.

Markarova said Ukraine was gathering evidence of shelling of residential areas, kindergartens and hospitals to submit to The Hague as possible crimes against humanity.

Zelensky reiterated his openness to talks with Russia in a video message, saying he welcomed an offer from Turkey and Azerbaijan to organize diplomatic efforts, which so far have faltered.

The Kremlin confirmed a phone call between Putin and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev but gave no hint of restarting talks. A day earlier, Zelensky offered to negotiate a key Russian demand: abandoning ambitions of joining NATO.

Putin sent troops into Ukraine after denying for weeks that he intended to do so, all the while building up a force of almost 200,000 troops along the countries’ borders. He claims the West has failed to take seriously Russia’s security concerns about NATO, the Western military alliance that Ukraine aspires to join. But he has also expressed scorn about Ukraine’s right to exist as an independent state.

The effort was already coming at great cost to Ukraine, and apparently to Russian forces as well.

Ukraine’s Infrastructure Ministry said a Russian missile was shot down before dawn Saturday as it headed for the dam of the sprawling reservoir that serves Kyiv. The government also said a Russian convoy was destroyed. Video images showed soldiers inspecting burned-out vehicles after Ukraine’s 101st brigade reported destroying a column of two light vehicles, two trucks and a tank. The claim could not be verified.

Highways into Kyiv from the east were dotted with checkpoints manned by Ukrainian troops and young men in civilian clothes carrying automatic rifles. Low-flying planes patrolled the skies, though it was unclear if they were Russian or Ukrainian.

In addition to Kyiv, the Russian assault appeared to focus on Ukraine’s economically vital coastal areas, from near the Black Sea port of Odesa in the west to beyond the Azov Sea port of Mariupol in the east.

Ukrainian soldiers in Mariupol guarded bridges and blocked people from the shoreline amid concerns the Russian navy could launch an assault from the sea.

“I don’t care anymore who wins and who doesn’t,” said Ruzanna Zubenko, whose large family was forced from their home outside Mariupol after it was badly damaged by shelling. “The only important thing is for our children to be able to grow up smiling and not crying.”

Fighting also raged in two eastern territories controlled by pro-Russia separatists. Authorities in Donetsk said hot water supplies to the city of about 900,000 were suspended because of damage to the system by Ukrainian shelling.

The U.S. government urged Zelensky early Saturday to evacuate Kyiv but he turned down the offer, according to a senior American intelligence official with direct knowledge of the conversation. Zelensky issued a defiant video recorded on a downtown street, saying he remained in the city.

“We aren’t going to lay down weapons. We will protect the country,” he said. “Our weapon is our truth, and our truth is that it’s our land, our country, our children. And we will defend all of that.”

Hungary and Poland both opened their borders to Ukrainians.

Refugees arriving in the Hungarian border town of Zahony said men between the ages of 18 and 60 were not being allowed to leave Ukraine.

“My son was not allowed to come. My heart is so sore, I’m shaking,” said Vilma Sugar, 68.

At Poland’s Medyka crossing, some said they had walked for 15 miles (35 kilometers) to reach the border.

“They didn’t have food, no tea, they were standing in the middle of a field, on the road, kids were freezing,” Iryna Wiklenko said as she waited on the Polish side for her grandchildren and daughter-in-law to make it across.

Officials in Kyiv urged residents to stay away from windows to avoid debris or bullets. Many hunkered down in basements, underground garages and subway stations, where families, some with pets, camped out on hard floors.

Shelves were sparsely stocked at grocery stores and pharmacies, and people worried how long food and medicine supplies might last.

The U.S. and its allies have beefed up forces on NATO’s eastern flank but so far have ruled out deploying troops to fight Russia. Instead, the U.S., the European Union and other countries have slapped wide-ranging sanctions on Russia, freezing the assets of businesses and individuals including Putin and his foreign minister.

Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia’s Security Council, warned that Moscow could react by opting out of the last remaining nuclear arms pact, freezing Western assets and cutting diplomatic ties.

“There is no particular need in maintaining diplomatic relations,” Medvedev said. “We may look at each other in binoculars and gunsights.”

The rest of the group chimed in: ""Glory to heroes!""

Zelensky's post, which has since gone viral online has been widely shared across different social media platforms.

Also on Friday night, Zelensky released a formal national address, confirming that Russian forces were close to the capital, advancing from the north and the east. He added that he was still communicating with world leaders including US President Joe Biden.

KYIV: Two loud blasts were heard in central Kyiv early Friday, an AFP journalist said, as Russian troops push closer to the Ukrainian capital in an invasion of its Western-backed neighbour.

Ukraine's army said that Russia fired on civilian areas of Kyiv but that Ukraine's air defence systems repelled ""two deadly gifts"", according to a post on its verified Facebook page.

Ukrainian foreign minister also tweeted out condemning rocket strikes on Kyiv.

Kyiv mayor Vitaly Klitschko said three people were injured with one in critical condition after ""missile debris"" hit a residential building.

He tweeted a photo showing a building with part of its wall torn down and firefighters present at the scene.

Russian missiles and shelling rained down on Ukrainian cities on Thursday after President Vladimir Putin unleashed a full-scale ground invasion and air assault, forcing civilians to shelter on metro systems.

Russia's forces pressed deep into Ukraine as deadly battles reached the outskirts of Kyiv and the West responded with punishing sanctions.

On Thursday, Russian paratroopers wrested control of the Gostomel airfield, on the northwestern outskirts of Kyiv, after swooping in with helicopters and jets from the direction of Belarus.
