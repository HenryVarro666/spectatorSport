ROME, April 5 (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said that ""war crimes"" carried out in Ukraine must be punished, while Rome said it was expelling 30 Russian diplomats on national security grounds.

In a speech in Turin on Tuesday, Draghi also urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to halt the ""massacre of civilians"".

""President Putin, the Russian authorities and its army will have to be held to account for their actions,"" he said.

Draghi called for an independent investigation into deaths in the Ukrainian town of Bucha which came to light on Sunday, prompting international outrage.

Russia has denied responsibility for the Bucha killings.

Draghi said Italy was aligned with the European Union in its stance over the hostilities in Ukraine and ""supports with conviction"" a new package of sanctions presented by the EU Commission earlier on Tuesday.

Italy said earlier that it was the latest Western country to expel Russian diplomats because of security concerns following the invasion of Ukraine in February.

The Russian embassy in Rome said that no proof had been provided to back up the security concerns and that diplomats and their families had been given only 72 hours to leave Italian territory.

Ambassador Sergey Razov warned that the move would further harm bilateral relations and that Russia would respond.

Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova responded that ""Russia will give a pertinent answer,"" as reported by Interfax.

""There will be no threats to stop our action for peace,” added Di Maio. “Our goal is to achieve peace in this war in Ukraine, a war wanted and unleashed by Putin, who we must stop with all our strength, starting with the ceasefire and reaching an agreement.”

Russian Ambassador to Italy, Sergey Razov, was called to attend a meeting at the foreign ministry with Secretary-General, Ettore Francesco Sequi, in Rome. He was notified of “the Italian government’s decision to expel 30 Russian diplomats serving at the embassy as persona non grata” during the meeting.

The move comes in response to the atrocities committed by Russian officers in the city of Bucha and other towns near Kyiv.

“Such a measure, made together with our European and Atlantic partners, was necessary for our national security, in the context of the current crisis resulting from the unjustified aggression against Ukraine by the Russian Federation,” Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio announced.

The expulsion is part of a coordinated European operation that involved different countries. The French and German governments expelled on Monday 35 and 40 Russian diplomats respectively. On Tuesday, shortly after Rome’s announcement, Madrid followed and expelled 25 diplomats.

Right-wing party League, a partner in the government coalition, has dissociated itself from Italy’s move. “The Farnesina will have made its assessments. Certainly, history teaches that peace is achieved through dialogue and diplomacy and not by expelling diplomats”, sources from the party told Corriere della Sera.

Moscow’s reaction to the Italian announcement did not take long.

“Italy’s unjustified decision will lead to a further deterioration of bilateral relations”, since “no evidence has been provided” to explain why Russian diplomats threaten Italian security, Ambassador Razov claimed.

Russia “will expel Italian diplomats”, Maria Zakharova, spokeswoman of Russia’s foreign ministry said.",https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/short_news/italy-to-expel-30-russian-diplomats/

The Italian Foreign Minister, Luigi di Maio, announced on Tuesday from Berlin the expulsion of 30 diplomats from the Russian embassy as a risk “to national security” and following the decisions taken by other European countries.

Di Maio, who is in Berlin for the Moldova Support Group conference, announced that this Tuesday the Russian ambassador to Italy, Sergei Razov, was summoned to inform him of the expulsion of these 30 diplomats considered “persona non grata”, adding that it is taking place “in the context of the current situation of consequent crisis to the unjustified aggression against Ukraine by the Russian Federation”.

Italy thus continues the decision to expel diplomats who had already taken countries such as Denmark, Germany or France in recent hours, although it did not yet communicate the deadlines for them to leave the nation.

On Monday, the German Government declared 40 Russian diplomats from the Berlin embassy, also considered spies, “persona non grata”, who have been given five days to leave the country.

Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock stressed that the employees of the Russian embassy are a “threat to those who seek protection among us.”

According to the German agency DPA, the Minister of the Interior, Nancy Faeser, said that the diplomats expelled are those “that we attribute to the Russian intelligence services.”

“We will not allow this criminal war of aggression to be carried out as an information war in Germany as well,” Faeser said.

France, for its part, reported the expulsion of “numerous” diplomats from that country, considering their activity contrary to national “security interests”.
