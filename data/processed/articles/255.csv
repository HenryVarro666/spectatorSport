Ukrainian troops are engaging in firefights with Russian troops in the Ukrainian city of Voznesensk, over 50 miles north of Mykolaiv, a video posted to social media shows.

CNN has geolocated, and verified the authenticity of the video.

In the video, a number of Ukrainian military troops are seen on the southern side of Voznesensk near market. The soldiers are seen armed with shoulder-fired missiles and the sound of gunfire is heard.

Suddenly, an explosion is seen and heard near the side of the building where at least two Ukrainian troops are seen taking cover. As the camera suddenly backs away, one of the soldiers is seen falling back. It's unclear if any soldiers were injured in the explosion.

Continued fighting in Voznesensk is notable given that the Russian military have yet to defeat Ukrainian forces in Mykolaiv, 50 miles to the south. It suggests that some of the Russian military is bypassing the intense exchanges in Mykolaiv and attempting to advance further north.",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-09-22/h_12bf788f779d8edf67aa02ca33f72530

The battle for Kyiv is underway as Russian tanks push to within just a few miles of the city outskirts, analysts and witnesses have said, though initial assaults to the west and east of the capital were repelled as Vladimir Putin's forces face a long and bloody campaign to try and take the capital.

Kremlin troops launched two attacks on Kyiv Wednesday - one via the besieged western city of Irpin and another through the eastern district of Brovary, with video showing the moment Russian tanks and armoured vehicles were bombarded with artillery in a devastating ambush and forced to turn back.

Colonel Andrei Zakharov, commander of the tank regiment, was also killed in the ambush according to the Ukrainian defence ministry and radio chatter intercepted from Russians on the battlefield. The same transmissions suggested the column suffered heavy losses, with one tank and an armoured vehicle destroyed.

It marks just the latest Russian commander to be killed in Ukraine, after two generals were slain by Kyiv's troops. Colonel Zakharov had been awarded the Order of Courage by Vladimir Putin in 2016.

Vadym Denysenko, adviser to Ukraine's interior ministry, said Ukrainian forces had also managed to stop the attack in Irpin and were counter-attacking on Thursday morning with battles underway. In an afternoon update, the military said it had foiled a Russian attempt to cross the Irpin River in the town of Moshchun.

'The night was quite difficult, but in general we can say that the Ukrainian army counterattacked near Kyiv,' he said. 'There is no further detailed information yet.' Fighting was also reported to the south west of Kyiv as Putin's men continued their efforts to surround the city.

It means the Russian mission to overwhelm the Ukrainian capital is now underway, analysts at the Institute for the Study of War said, amid fears that devastating airstrikes on the city of Mariupol - which struck a maternity hospital killing three including a six-year-old girl - and Kharkiv could soon be seen in the capital.

President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is still in Kyiv, said Thursday that his 'heart breaks at what the occupants have done with our cities, our country, and at what they want to do to our people' who he said needed 'urgent help.'

Zelensky said seven humanitarian corridors were urgently being organised from bombarded cities to get civilians out and aid packages in, which were meeting with mixed success. Some 35,000 people were able to flee cities under attack by Russian forces on Wednesday, he said, including from the Kyiv suburbs and the eastern city of Sumy.

However, there has been no relief for the people of hard-hit Mariupol, which has been under bombardment for more than a week with no food, water, or electricity.

On Wednesday, a Russian airstrike targeted a children's hospital in Mariupol in the south, wounding at least 17 people. Mortuary workers were pictured putting corpses in body bags or carpets, taking them to the outskirts of the besieged port city, and then dumping them in mass graves.

A convoy was trying to reach the city today to bring supplies, but there was no word on whether it had managed to get through by early afternoon. Four previous attempts to bring relief to the city have failed, after Ukraine said Russia shelled the route it was intending to use.

Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said today that the city has been turned into a fortress ahead of the Russian assault, with about 2 million people - half the residents of the metro area of the capital - having fled.

'Every street, every house is being fortified, the territorial defence is joining. Even people who in their lives never intended to change their clothes, now they are in uniform with machine guns in their hands,' he said in televised remarks.

Troops were also warning civilians not to stray beyond the outskirts of the city, because Russian vehicles had been spotted just a few miles away. If Putin's men can encircle Kyiv, they are expected to shell it as they have done with other cities such as Mariupol, Kharkiv and Chernihiv.

Shelling in Kharkiv overnight killed four people, two of them children, with a five-year-old girl injured and rushed to hospital. Emergency workers said they are still working to pull people from the rubble of houses in the town of Slobozhanske. Three people were also killed in shelling on the city of Sumy - two women and a 13-year-old boy.

Bombs also fell on two hospitals in Zhytomyr west of the capital, the mayor said, as Russian forces intensified their siege of Ukrainian cities.

Giving an update on the situation on the ground onThursday, Ukraine's military said Russian efforts to attack Kyiv had been 'restrained' with offensives also thwarted in the cities of Mykolayiv as Putin's men try to push towards Kryvyi Rih - to the northeast and birthplace of the President - and Voznesensk - to the northwest.

Mariupol continues to be surrounded by Russian forces but is still in Ukrainian hands, officials said. They said Ukrainian fighter jets and anti-aircraft missile units destroyed four Russian Su-25 attack jet and two Russian helicopters over the past 48 hours.

Kyiv estimates that Russia has lost some 12,000 troops in the fighting, along with 335 tanks, 1,100 armoured personnel carriers, 500 vehicles, 81 helicopters and 49 planes. Moscow has admitted suffering losses, but has not given an accurate figure.

There has been no word from Ukraine on casualties its military has suffered. Russia says it has destroyed more than 2,900 Ukrainian military infrastructure facilities has has taken control of a number of neighbourhoods in besieged southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol.

Speaking about the Russian strike on the hospital in Mariupol, foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on Wednesday denied that any patients had been inside at the time - despite pictures showing pregnant women being taken out with injuries - and accused Ukrainian 'extremists' of occupying it.

In a stunning act of hypocrisy, he outright denied that Russia had attacked Ukraine and added that the Kremlin 'does not intend to attack anyone else' - raising fears that Putin does in fact aim to go beyond the borders of his ex-Soviet neighbour. Battle plans broadcast on TV by Belarus ally Alexander Lukashenko in the opening days of the war seemed to suggest that Moldova could be targeted.

He also vowed that Russia 'will survive' western sanctions on Putin's regime, and 'will do everything not to rely on the West ever, in any areas of our lives.' He added: 'We have no illusions the West can be a reliable partner, [it will] betray whoever, and will betray its own values.'

Lavrov was speaking after talks with Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba on the sidelines of a summit in Turkey, which ended without an agreement to stop the fighting.

Kuleba, speaking after the meeting, said Russia had demanded that Ukraine 'surrender' - which he said 'we will not do'. Ukraine wants a diplomatic solution, he added, but is determined to keep fighting if needs be.

Ukraine's military warned on Wednesday that Russia is 'not abandoning its plans to encircle' Kyiv and that its 'defence forces are repelling and holding back' the offensive 'in all directions'.

The crisis in Ukraine is likely to get worse as Russian forces resort to increasingly brutal and indiscriminate attacks on civilian areas in response to stronger than expected resistance.

CIA director William Burns on Tuesday said that Russian losses have been 'far in excess' of what Moscow expected, sparking fears that Putin's generals will ramp up their 'war of terror' on innocent civilians and strike further non-military targets.

An official told The Times in London: 'I think around Kyiv they are continuing to tighten the noose… this is definitely not over. They are still set on moving in. It'll be utterly horrific when they do'.

Britain's Ministry of Defence said fighting continued northwest of the capital on Wednesday, with the cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol being heavily pummelled by surrounding Russian forces.

Putin's troops are placing military equipment on farms and amid residential buildings in the northern city of Chernihiv, Ukraine's military said. In the south, Russians in civilian clothes are advancing on the city of Mykolaiv, a Black Sea shipbuilding centre of 500,000 people, it said.

The Ukrainian military, meanwhile, is building up defences in cities in the north, south and east, and forces around Kyiv are 'holding the line' against the Russian offensive, authorities said.

In Irpin, a town of 60,000, police officers and soldiers helped elderly residents from their homes. One man was hoisted out of a damaged structure on a makeshift stretcher, while another was pushed toward Kyiv in a shopping cart. Fleeing residents said they had been without power and water for the past four days.

Regional administration head Oleksiy Kuleba said the crisis for civilians is deepening in and around Kyiv, with the situation particularly dire in the suburbs.

'Russia is artificially creating a humanitarian crisis in the Kyiv region, frustrating the evacuation of people and continuing shelling and bombing small communities,' he said.

The situation is even worse in Mariupol, a strategic city of 430,000 people on the Sea of Azov that has been encircled by Russian forces for the past week.

Efforts to evacuate residents and deliver badly needed food, water and medicine failed on Tuesday because of what the Ukrainians said were continued Russian attacks. The city took advantage of a lull in the shelling on Wednesday to hurriedly bury 70 people. Some were soldiers but most were civilians.

Authorities announced new cease-fires on Wednesday morning to allow thousands of civilians to escape from towns around Kyiv as well as the southern cities of Mariupol, Enerhodar and Volnovakha, Izyum in the east and Sumy in the northeast.

Previous attempts to establish safe evacuation corridors largely failed because of what the Ukrainians said were Russian attacks. But Putin, in a telephone call with Germany's chancellor, accused militant Ukrainian nationalists of hampering the evacuations.

It was not immediately clear whether anyone was able to leave other cities on Wednesday, but people streamed out of Kyiv's suburbs, many headed for the city centre, even as explosions were heard in the capital and air raid sirens sounded repeatedly. From there, the evacuees planned to board trains bound for western Ukrainian regions not under attack.

Nationwide, thousands are thought to have been killed, both civilians and soldiers, in the two weeks of fighting since Putin's forces invaded. The UN estimates more than 2million people have fled the country, the biggest exodus of refugees in Europe since the end of the Second World War.

The fighting knocked out power to the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant, raising fears about the spent fuel that is stored at the site and must be kept cool. But the UN nuclear watchdog agency said it saw 'no critical impact on safety' from the loss of power.

Zelensky warned on Wednesday that 'millions' of Ukrainians could die if NATO and the West wait for World War Three to start before imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine. He also warned that Russia wants Ukrainians to 'feel like animals' as he urged the West to act two weeks after Moscow launched an all-out invasion of his homeland – and added that Putin is 'going directly to hell'.

'They want us to feel like animals because they blocked our cities, the biggest cities in Ukraine and they blocked them because they don't want our people to get some food or water,' he said in an interview with Sky News.

'We can't stop all of this alone. Only if the world will unite around Ukraine.

'Don't wait for me to ask you several times, a million times, to close the sky. You have to phone us, to our people who lost their children, and say 'sorry we didn't do it yesterday'.

'The world did nothing. I'm sorry, but it's true. In future, it will be too late. They will close the sky but will lose millions of people [while they wait]'.

Ukraine has called on Putin's Russia to 'capitulate' as Kremlin lapdog Sergei Lavrov prepares for 'peace talks' with Kyiv's foreign minister in Turkey on Thursday.

Moscow's most senior diplomat arrived in the southern resort city of Antalya to negotiate with Dmytro Kuleba at a summit mediated by Ankara, which has supplied Ukraine with drones and condemned the invasion but criticised punitive global sanctions against Russia.

Russia and Ukraine's meeting will be the highest-level diplomatic encounter since the Kremlin launched a full-scale operation to 'demilitarise' and 'de-Nazify' the country – aims dismissed as baseless pretexts by Kyiv and the West to instead overthrow Zelensky.

But in a video on Facebook confirming that talks would proceed, Kuleba said his expectations were 'limited' and that the success of the negotiations would depend on 'what instructions and directives Lavrov is under' from the Kremlin at the discussions.

Russia has demanded that Ukraine cease military action, change its constitution to enshrine neutrality so it cannot join the EU or NATO, recognise Crimea as sovereign Russian territory and recognise the separatist republics of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent territories.

Speaking to BBC Newsnight on Wednesday, Ukraine's deputy prime minister Iryna Verashchuk called Moscow's peace terms 'ultimatums' and thundered: 'There is only one discussion to be had: Russia's capitulation.'

'I think that in order to make demands you need to meet, you need to talk. But of course, the ultimatums that Russia has put forward are unacceptable: to recognize Crimea, to recognise the separatist republics as independent states, this is completely impossible,' she said.

'Of course we cannot trade away our territory, we would have to amend the constitution. How could we look the Ukrainian people in the eye and calmly give away a part of sovereign independent Ukraine. How will we look our children in the eyes? This is aggression, not just against Ukraine as you can clearly see. This is a challenge to the whole world.'

Asked what Ukraine wants from the West, Verashchuk went on: 'We want them to help us to impose a no-fly zone, at least over critical infrastructure. We would like air defence systems'.

When it was put to her that Britain and the US have ruled out no-fly zones because of the risk of nuclear war with Russia, Kyiv's deputy prime minister retorted: 'And the fact that the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is no longer under our control? You don't think that is a nuclear standoff with Russia?

'Putin is raising the stakes, he knows that. Who do you think this is aimed at? President Zelensky, or President Biden?'.

Putin's actions have sparked an unprecedented Western diplomatic, economic and cultural boycott of Russia and all things Russian.

Britain's prime minister Boris Johnson has committed to impose the 'maximum economic cost' on Russia as the Foreign Secretary is expected to say aggression like Putin's must 'never again' be allowed to 'grow unchecked'.

In a call on Wednesday evening, the Prime Minister joined Zelensky in condemning a reported Russian strike on a maternity hospital in the besieged port city of Mariupol.

He noted that this, together with reports Russian forces had failed to respect ceasefire agreements, was 'yet further evidence that Putin was acting with careless disregard for international humanitarian law', Downing Street said.

Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss prepared to call for a 'paradigm shift' in the wake of Russia's assault on Ukraine.

In a speech in the US on Thursday, she will make comparisons between the Russian despot's actions and 9/11, and will urge the international community to change its approach to dealing with antagonistic world leaders.

One of the three areas where she will say the UK wants to see stronger action is on forging stronger global alliances, including with countries not historically aligned to Britain, according to Foreign Office officials.

Giving the Makins Lecture at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, the Cabinet minister will say it is time to end 'strategic dependence' on hostile and authoritarian states, including a departure from using Russian energy.

It comes after the UK and the US on Tuesday announced they will phase out imports of Russian oil by the end of the year as part of increased sanctions on Moscow.

Truss will also argue that allies must strengthen deterrence by spending more on defence and NATO, warning that the 'era of complacency is over'.

The Foreign Secretary is expected to say that the West needs to become 'tough' in its approach to global security in the wake of the Ukraine crisis in order to prevent future aggressors from making advances.

She will urge leaders to ramp up global pressure and 'tighten the vice' on the Kremlin, including by implementing further sanctions, such as encouraging other countries to join in bringing about punitive measures and implementing a 'full Swift ban'.

Truss, who on Wednesday met US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, is scheduled to argue that Putin has 'launched a full-frontal assault' not just on Ukraine but 'on the very foundation of our societies and the rules by which we coexist'.

She will add: 'The invasion of Ukraine is a paradigm shift on the scale of 9/11. How we respond today will set the pattern for this new era.

'If we let Putin's expansionism go unchallenged it would send a dangerous message to would-be aggressors and authoritarians around the world. We can't allow that to happen.'

Brave Ukrainian Driver Jokes with Russian soldiers

Although Russia has been charging towards Kyiv with full force, there are reports of a few of the country’s military tanks going out of gas. As a result of which, the Russian soldiers in those tanks are now stuck on the highways of Ukraine.

One such military tank was spotted by a Ukrainian driver who had been passing by through the same route that the Russian soldiers were stranded on. The man is seen initiating a conversation with one of the soldiers and even goes out on a limb to make a joke, earning a bubble of laughter from the Russian men.

A short video of the same has been going viral all over the internet and on social media platforms.

Russian Army tank ran out of fuel and this Ukrainian offered to tow them back to Russia. 🇺🇦pic.twitter.com/jjFDkhfxGb — Marie-Ann Hates Tories and Brexit (@MarieAnnUK) February 27, 2022

In the clip, the Ukrainian driver who seems to be driving from the highway brings his car to a halt as he sees a Russian military tank on the side of the road.

Upon asking what the matter was, one of the soldiers informed the driver about their situation, saying they’ve run out of fuel. And to that, the driver responds by roasting him and saying that he could “tow them back to Russia.” He even got some of the soldiers to laugh at the hilarious retort.

He continued the conversation by asking them if they knew where they were headed but the Russian soldiers had no clue. And when a soldier asked him about the news, the driver readily replied by telling them how Ukraine is winning while their country is surrendering.

And as he drives away, yet another military tank is seen stranded on the side of the highway before the video comes to an end.

The Ukrainian driver is going viral on Twitter

It is not only astonishing that someone from Ukraine’s side engaged in a light and humorous conversation with Russian soldiers, but it is also fairly surprising to see that the latter reverted with the same energy.

With everything that has been going on between Ukraine and Russia, one would certainly not expect people from either side to pass jokes and roast the other one. At least not anytime soon.

But as a Ukrainian driver did exactly that, it created a lighter and a somewhat wholesome feeling for a moment or two. And he is currently trending on Twitter for the same.

As some laughed along and appreciated the driver for his bravery, others made remarks about how they overestimated the Russian military considering how their tanks are running out of fuel so quickly.

What is the current scenario of the Ukraine-Russia crisis?

Currently, Ukraine is still at it with trying to protect its citizens from all the carnage as two massive explosions were seen hitting Kyiv from the side of Vasylkiv.

On the other hand, there are people like the Ukrainian driver, who even though, is suffering along with his country, is still trying their best to be kind and funny. And that too, to the soldiers of the country that is so hell-bent on destroying his.

This just shows how peace is always an option, and even during incredibly tough times like these, at the end of the day, we’re all just simple humans; kindness indeed goes a long way.",https://www.thetealmango.com/latest/russian-tank-runs-out-of-fuel-ukrainian-driver-mocks-russian-soldiers/

Reports say Russia has 12,400 tanks which is the largest in the world with Ukraine possessing 2,586 tanks. Ukraine has 74 T-64 tanks against Russia's 2,000.

Ukraine also has 3,666 T-72 tanks however Russia has nearly twice that number at 9,950. Clearly as far as size is concerned the tank strength of the two countries is greatly mismatched.

Russia has in fact developed the T-14 Armata and has already produced 2,300 even since it was unveiled in 2015. It was battle-tested in Syria. It has state of the art laser-guided missiles with Kord 12.7mm and PKTM 7.62mm machine gun.

The T-14 can reportedly withstand nuclear, biological and chemical attacks. Russia currently has 20 T-14s which could prove to be a big hurdle for Ukraine's forces.

The likelihood is increasing that Ukrainian forces could fight to a standstill the Russian ground forces attempting to encircle and take Kyiv. Russian forces also appear to be largely stalemated around Kharkiv and distracted from efforts to seize that city. Russian advances in the south around Mykolayiv and toward Zaporizhya and in the east around Donetsk and Luhansk made little progress as well in the last 24 hours. Russia likely retains much greater combat power in the south and east and will probably renew more effective offensive operations in the coming days, but the effective reach and speed of such operations is questionable given the general performance of the Russian military to date. There are as yet no indications that the Russian military is reorganizing, reforming, learning lessons, or taking other measures that would lead to a sudden change in the pace or success of its operations, although the numerical disparities between Russia and Ukraine leave open the possibility that Moscow will be able to restore rapid mobility or effective urban warfare to the battlefield.

Russian forces around Kyiv did not attempt to renew offensive operations on a multi-battalion scale on March 10 following the failure of limited efforts on March 8-9. Ukrainian forces badly damaged a Russian armored column in the Brovary area east of Kyiv, likely further disrupting Russian efforts to set conditions for offensive operations on the east bank of the Dnipro. Ukrainian resistance all along the Russian lines of communication from eastern Kyiv to the Russian border near Sumy continues to disrupt Russian efforts to bring more combat power to bear near the capital. The episodic, limited, and largely unsuccessful Russian offensive operations around Kyiv increasingly support the Ukrainian General Staff’s repeated assessments that Russia lacks the combat power near the capital to launch successful offensive operations on a large scale.

Key Takeaways

Russian operations around Kyiv remained largely stalled over the past 24 hours.

Ukrainian forces badly damaged a Russian armored unit east of the capital, likely disrupting Russian efforts to encircle or assault the city from the east.

Russian forces continue to struggle in efforts to seize Chernihiv city and to secure the long ground lines of communication from Sumy, which the Ukrainians still hold, to eastern Kyiv.

A new Russian invasion from western Belarus, with or without Belarusian ground forces’ support, appears increasingly unlikely.

Russian forces remain pinned down attempting to reduce Mariupol by siege and bombardment.

Russian efforts to bypass Mykolayiv and establish a reliable ground line of communication across the Southern Bug River to the north of Mykolayiv remain stalled.

Ukrainian air force and air defense operations continue to hinder Russian ground forces maneuver by likely limiting Russian close air support and exposing Russian mechanized forces to Ukrainian air and artillery attacks.

Russian forces are engaged in four primary efforts at this time:

Main effort—Kyiv (comprised of three subordinate supporting efforts);

Supporting effort 1—Kharkiv; Supporting effort 1a—Luhansk Oblast;

Supporting effort 2—Mariupol; and

Supporting effort 3—Kherson and advances westward.

Main effort—Kyiv axis: Russian operations on the Kyiv axis are aimed at encircling the city from the northwest, west, and east.

Russian forces did not make any substantial gains in the past 24 hours. The Ukrainian military reported it halted Russian advances “in all directions” and that Russian forces have reduced their offensive pace due to demoralization on March 10.[1] The Ukrainian Air Force and Ukrainian air defenses additionally remain operational. The Ukrainian General Staff claimed that Ukrainian air defenses and fighters shot down four Russian Su-25 aircraft, two helicopters, and two cruise missiles on March 8-9.[2] Individual Russian attacks at roughly regiment size reported on March 8-9 may represent the maximum scale of offensive operations Russian forces can conduct on this axis at any one time. Russian forces will likely require a period longer than the previous operational pauses of 48-72 hours to sufficiently reinforce their forces to resume advances on Kyiv, if they are able to at all.

Subordinate main effort along the west bank of the Dnipro

Russian forces did not make any substantial advances west of Kyiv on March 10. The Ukrainian General Staff reported at noon local time on March 10 that Russian forces occupy a ring of positions north and west of Kyiv running through Poliske, Kukhari, Borodyanka, Andriyivka, Motyzhyn, Horenychi, Bucha, and Demydiv.[3] Russian forces made slight advances in Motyzhyn and Bucha, two towns west of Kyiv, but Russian positions in Kyiv’s northwestern outskirts remained the same over the past 24 hours. The Ukrainian General Staff did not report any new details on the Russian elements that attempted to push south toward Fastiv from Byshiv since March 9. The Ukrainian General Staff reported at 10:00 am local time on March 10 that Ukrainian forces continue to maintain their defensive lines around Kyiv.[4] The General Staff claimed Russian forces have not abandoned their efforts to encircle Kyiv from the west and southwest but predominantly regrouped and replaced combat losses over the last 24 hours.[5] Ukrainian forces repulsed Russian attacks on Vyshhorod (approximately 18 kilometers directly north of Kyiv along the west bank of the Dnipro River) and on Moshchun (roughly 20 kilometers northwest of Kyiv on the Irpin River) on March 10.[6]

The Ukrainian General Staff additionally reported on March 10 that Russian saboteurs are wearing yellow armbands (an identifying marker of Ukrainian forces) as well as a yellow band on the leg to identify themselves to other Russian forces.[7] The General Staff additionally stated Russian saboteurs may have infiltrated Kyiv under the guise of evacuated residents of Kyiv’s suburbs.[8] ISW cannot independently confirm the possible successes of Russian efforts to infiltrate Kyiv.

The apparent failure of Russian forces’ attacks on March 8-9 after reconstituting and preparing during the operational pause and resupply efforts of the past several days supports the Ukrainian General Staff assessments that Russian forces have far less effective combat power around the capital than their numbers would suggest.[9]

Russian and/or Belarusian forces remain unlikely to attempt to open a new axis of advance into western Ukraine in the near future. The Ukrainian General Staff reported on March 10 that Ukrainian forces continue to cover the border with Belarus.[10] The Russian military is unlikely to be able to concentrate sufficient combat power to conduct any meaningful operation against western Ukraine. The Ukrainian General Staff reported at midnight on March 9 that Belarus is supplying Russian forces with fuel and supplies and allowing Russian forces to use Belarusian bases but has not committed its own forces.[11]Russian aircraft additionally continue to operate from several Belarusian airbases.[12] Russia will likely continue to prioritize feeding individual replacements and reinforcing units to its ongoing main effort to encircle Kyiv, rather than attempting a new line of advance.

Subordinate supporting effort—Chernihiv axis

Russian forces unsuccessfully continued efforts to assault Chernihiv on March 10. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces continue to hold the city as of 6:00 am local time on March 10.[13] Ukrainian forces additionally claimed to destroy a Russian Iskander-M missile battalion near Chernihiv on March 10.[14] The Ukrainian General Staff previously reported on March 9 that elements of the 2nd Combined Arms Army, 41st Combined Arms Army, and 90th Tank Division are attempting to renew the offensive toward Chernihiv and Kyiv from the north.[15]

Ukrainian forces likely successfully repelled Russian attacks on Brovary, an eastern suburb of Kyiv, on March 10. The Ukrainian GUR claimed Ukrainian forces killed Russian Colonel A. Zakharov, commander of the 6th Tank Regiment of the 90th Tank Division, in Brovary on March 10.[16] Several social media users additionally posted videos, later verified by CNN, of Russian losses in Brovary on March 9-10.[17]

Subordinate supporting effort—Sumy axis

Russian forces likely continued efforts to consolidate control of their lines of communication to eastern Kyiv along the Sumy axis in the past 24 hours as Ukrainian forces continue to contest them. Russian forces again unsuccessfully attacked Okhtyrka in Sumy Oblast throughout March 9-10.[18] Ukrainian forces did not report any counterattacks against Russian forces in Sumy Oblast in the past 24 hours but claimed that Ukrainian troops continued ”stabilization operations” and territorial defense outside the Kyiv and southeastern axes, likely referring to fighting in northeastern Ukraine.[19] This continued fighting likely indicates that the Russians are struggling to consolidate control over this long line of communication and that Ukrainian forces are actively contesting it.

Supporting Effort #1—Kharkiv:

Russian forces continued to bombard Kharkiv on March 10 but have not renewed attempts to take the city through ground assault on a large scale.[20] Kharkiv Governor Oleh Sinegubov additionally claimed that Ukrainian forces recaptured the northern Kharkiv suburb of Dergachi from Russian forces on March 10—Ukrainian forces‘ third claimed counteroffensive in Kharkiv Oblast since February 24.[21]

Russian forces, likely from the Kharkiv axis, also continued operations to the southeast on March 10. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian forces attempted to seize Izyum, Petrivske, and Hrushuvakha, three towns approximately 110 kilometers southeast of Kharkiv.[22] Russian forces advancing southeast from the Kharkiv axis likely seek to link up with Russian forces advancing west from Donbas but are unlikely to do so in the near future given that Russian forces have been trying and failing to take Izyum since at least March 8.[23]

Supporting Effort #1a—Luhansk Oblast:

The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian and proxy forces continued attacks in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts on March 10, focused on the city of Kryvyi Rih.[24] The military situation in Donbas has not materially changed in the past 24 hours.

Supporting Effort #2—Mariupol:

Russian forces continue to encircle and bombard Mariupol. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces continue to successfully defend the city.[25] The Russian proxy Donetsk People’s Republic claimed that its forces took control of several neighborhoods near Mariupol—including Azovskiy, Naydenovka, Lyapino, Vinogradar, and the Azovstal metallurgical factory—on March 10.[26] The Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR)’s 1st Army Corps (the Ukrainian designation for the Russian-controlled military forces of the DNR) additionally reportedly deployed conscripted troops to Mariupol on March 10.[27]

The Ukrainian General Staff reported at 6:00 am local time on March 10 that Ukraine’s main efforts are focused on preventing the Russians from advancing in the “south-eastern direction”—likely referring to Russian attacks towards Zaporizhya—as well as Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts.[28] The Ukrainian General Staff had not explicitly highlighted the southeast as an operational priority prior to March 10.

Supporting Effort #3—Kherson and west:

Russian forces continued assaults on the outskirts of Mykolayiv on March 10.[29] Ukrainian forces and social media reported ongoing fighting in Voznesensk, which is northwest of Mykolayiv and the furthest point of Russian advances west of the Dnipro River from Crimea.[30] The Ukrainian General Staff also stated that Russian forces are ”trying to gain a foothold” in settlements approximately 25 kilometers south and southeast of Mykolayiv on March 10, indicating that Russian forces are likely experiencing difficulty advancing northwest beyond the Inhul River.[31]

Russian forces continued to concentrate on the drive toward Mykolayiv and made little progress on other operations. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russia deployed a battalion tactical group of the 336th Naval Infantry Brigade (of the Baltic Fleet) to “the Crimean direction” on March 10, and previously reported increasing concentrations of Russian forces toward Mykolayiv on March 9.[32] The Ukrainian General Staff reported at midnight on March 9 that Russian forces continued attacks toward Zaporizhia but did not secure territorial gains.[33]

Immediate items to watch

Russian forces around Kyiv may undertake another operational pause to prepare for renewed efforts to encircle Kyiv from east and west and/or to seize the city center itself following their failures of the previous 48 hours;

Russian troops may drive on Zaporizhya city itself within the next 48-72 hours, likely attempting to block it from the east and set conditions for subsequent operations after Russian forces besieging Mariupol take that city;

Russian forces may attempt amphibious landings anywhere along the Black Sea Coast from Odesa to the mouth of the Southern Bug River in the next 24-48 hours.

In this essay, our editors attempt to assess the military situation in Ukraine based on the available data. This article was originally published in Russian on March 9, 2022. Meduza opposes the war and demands the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine.

In recent days (approximately from the 10th to 14th day of the war), the Russian incursion into the depths of Ukraine has stalled. The columns of advancing Russian battle groups are no longer moving any more than 10 kilometers (about 6 miles) a day. Meanwhile, the army continues to incur losses from Ukrainian counterattacks against the groups at the front as well as ambushes at the rear guard. Ukraine’s successes are documented and posted online by journalists and regular citizens with cellphones.

However, this does not mean that the invasion has come to a halt. According to the same Ukrainian photos and videos, geolocation shows that Russian troops have made significant advances toward their intended targets . This is true in many key areas on the several fronts that were formed since the beginning of the invasion:

Kyiv is essentially blocked from three sides. Masses of Russian troops have blocked the road leading west out of Kyiv in the direction of Zhytomyr and are moving south along the outskirts with an obvious objective of cutting off the city from all contact with the Western part of the country. The incursion continues despite constant pressure on both flanks from the directions of Kyiv and Zhytomyr. The Russian Army continues to incur losses here (per the posted videos which can been seen on our interactive map), but the Ukrainian Army cannot stop their advance completely.

Russian troops moving from Chernihiv and the Sumy region have approached the eastern and northeastern outskirts of Kyiv, Brovary, and the Boryspil Airport, and have fortified their positions there. Ukrainian active combat units in the rear guard attempting to divert Russian forces in Chernihiv (which is practically surrounded) have not been able to impede their advance. Equipment losses have also failed to stop these troops.

In the south, in the Zaporizhzhia region, the Ukrainian Army is attempting to close the breach that formed after its units were routed in the Azov Sea, while Russian troops are collecting abandoned Ukrainian equipment from their hastily evacuated military bases. Having joined forces with a group from the Donbas, Russian forces in the Zaporizhzhia region are moving north through the cities of Polohy and Hulyaipole. Their objective is probably to cut off all or part of the most powerful Ukrainian forces, which, before Russia’s full-scale invasion, had been concentrated on maintaining the Ukrainian military’s “line of contact” and resisting the forces of the self-proclaimed Donbas “republics.”

Russian combat groups from around the cities of Balakiya and Izyum are probably aiming to converge with the Russian group in Zaporizhzhia, moving south from Kharkiv. Izyum saw a number of battles in recent days, part of the city has been destroyed, but the true situation on the ground is unclear. If the city (an important transportation hub) is taken, Russia’s troops will be able to start moving toward the south or southwest.

In the Donbas itself, Russian forces have already “ ” Ukrainian troops around Mariupol and Volnovakha and are forming another “kettle” around Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk. In the past two days, Russian and “LNR” troops have taken these cities along with the large group of Ukrainian troops within them, which had been moving toward Luhansk prior to the invasion, from the north (from the direction of Russia) and from the south (from the direction of the “LNR”).

Around Kharkiv, Okhtyrka, and Sumy, the armies are exchanging fire and raids. The Russian Air Force is regularly bombing these cities but has not been able to make any significant gains on the ground. It’s possible that the Russian Army is not planning on any further advancement into these areas, with other directions — west of Sumy and south of Kharkiv — being higher priorities.

Finally, in a separate area unrelated to other directions, around Mykolayiv and in southwest Ukraine, Russian troops have incurred losses while attempting to make a quick break in the direction of Odesa. There is a video from early March with burnt-out artillery positions, damaged tanks, and damaged armored combat vehicles around Voznesensk, where there was a battle for the river crossing across the South Bug, near Bashtanka. Since then, the Russian Army has been massing forces in this area, as well as expanding the area under its control on the right bank of the Dnipro. The city of Mykolayiv is blockaded from the north and the east and under artillery fire.

How do we know all this? All modern-day wars take place under the “surveillance” of volunteers who gather and filter photos and videos, tossing out fakes and doubles. Their lists are completely transparent: the evidence of each loss can be verified by anyone. One of these lists, compiled by a group of authors who’ve “done the counts” on all recent wars, including Syria, Iraq, Libya, Karabakh, and the Donbas, can be found here.

The events of the past few days on our interactive map

You can also look at more traditional versions of this map that clearly mark which side controls what territories. The map also correlates well with data from open sources (photos, videos, and messages from Ukrainian municipal authorities on the situations in their territories).

Overall, the open sources create a rather contradictory picture . On the one hand, according to the video and photo documentation, the Russian Army is suffering nonstop defeats and incurring huge losses, first and foremost, in terms of equipment. On the other hand, the losses and defeats are taking place deeper and deeper into Ukrainian territory, ever closer to possible key targets in this phase of the war.

However, these two facts only appear to contradict one another. We must remember that these open sources provide only an incomplete picture, even with universal access to cellphones, cameras, and social networks. The warring sides also have fundamentally different political goals, tactics, and strategies. Therefore, the way they approach and present military matters is radically different.

The important thing to understand here As a rule, after a battle, one of the sides controls the battlefield (or has access to it), while the other does not. The former will probably be interested in showing the world its opponents’ losses rather than its own. However, in the case of Ukraine, the people documenting the losses have access to the entire territory of the country regardless of the position of the fronts because the majority of them are civilians. One of the sides may be more eager to gather documentation of losses than the other. In the case of the war in Ukraine, this is clearly the case since Russian troops are forbidden from taking photos or videos for social media. The exception has been Chechnya, whose National Guard troops are actively broadcasting their actions. Additionally, information about Ukrainian losses is usually reported by pro-government Russian journalists who are only allowed into a small handful of active combat zones. The majority of known Ukrainian losses in equipment and ammunition are documented in the Donbas, north of Kyiv (where the Chechen units are located), and, in recent days, in the Kherson region. Previously, a small portion of Ukrainian losses had been reported by Ukrainian civilians who confused lost Ukrainian equipment for Russian hardware. The Ukrainian government is conducting a campaign to publicize Russian losses and clearly considers this one of its most important instruments of warfare directed at Russian citizens. If Russians are “sensitized” to the losses, goes the logic, this may cause political pressure on the Kremlin. For its part, the Kremlin wants to keep Russian citizens away from any unofficial information and simply blocks or shuts down these media channels at home.

Open sources tell us a lot about the problems, losses, and misfortunes incurred by the Russian Army but very little about what is going on with the Ukrainian side, which has lost several areas and entire regions in the south and in the Donbas. Fragmentary information in Western media outlets paints a picture of heavy losses and terrible problems on the Ukrainian side.

A New York Times article published on March 6, based on interviews with Ukrainian officers, speaks of serious defeats and heavy combat sustained by the Ukrainian Army’s surrounded 59th Brigade in the south of the country during the first days of the war. According to its commanders, the brigade was attacked by Russian forces five times its size and was constantly under aerial assault (which it had nothing to defend itself from, since a significant portion of antiaircraft defenses had been recalled to Kyiv on the eve of the war). As a result, they were surrounded on the left bank of the Dnipro, where they incurred heavy losses of tanks and artillery. Then, what remained of the brigade managed to cross the river into Kherson. They were forced to leave the city under a new threat of siege, which would have meant total destruction for the remaining units. Now, what remains of the brigade is attempting to hold back the Russian incursion into Kherson alongside other units who have arrived from elsewhere.

The details of combat in another area of the southern front, in Melitopol and Berdyansk, have yet to be released. However, pro-government Russian journalists were allowed to photograph the captured Ukrainian artillery battalion base with its abandoned equipment and supplies.

Obviously, both sides are incurring heavy casualties . The Ukrainian ones increase when its active army units are surrounded. Encircling or creating the threat of encircling subdivisions or entire divisions seems to have become the Russian military’s primary objective in this phase of the war. The purpose of this is apparently to destroy a significant part of the Ukrainian Army as an organizing force in the Donbas, on the left bank of the Dnipro, and in Kyiv. In the past several days, the Russian Army has surrounded Mariupol and Chernihiv, and has clearly been preparing to continue its operations aimed at surrounding other areas.

Regardless, this does not mean that the war is going according to the Russian Joint Staff’s plan. The objectives and pace of the operations outlined in this plan are unknown to the public, but things are clearly not going the way they were planned, judging by the changes in how military operations are being conducted, as well as the apparent problems and losses we have observed from open sources.

Clearly, the Russian Army has run into unanticipated logistical problems: in various areas, the supply lines have been severely damaged, which affects the units at the front.

Frontline units are also experiencing problems with reconnaissance. Based on the data from open sources (namely, videos showing damaged and abandoned equipment), reconnaissance is being conducted by small groups that are dispersed in various directions, traveling with a handful of tanks and armored vehicles that are then damaged by the enemy’s artillery fire, anti-tank weapons, and counterattack tanks.

Russian artillery — at least the units around Kharkov and Mykolayiv — have experienced palpable losses from Ukrainian artillery. This speaks to the fact that these units are not universally superior in terms of reconnaissance, targeting, and fire power. At the same time, before the invasion, it was believed that one of the Russian Army’s biggest advantages was precisely its artillery. In the north and west of Kyiv, and in the Donbas, it seems that the Russian Army does indeed have this advantage.

The Russian command seems to have decided against deploying heliborne assaults behind enemy lines. The risks for the troops in the air and on the ground appear to be greater than the advantages that may be gained from taking targets deep behind enemy lines.

Deep incursions down roads with advancing troops are no longer being attempted. The closer the Russian Army has gotten to its targets, the greater the resistance it has faced, alongside increasing difficulty in providing supplies and reinforcements. This is precisely why the invasion has slowed down so much. Each operation now seems to demand that the Army first mass its forces, whether they’re blockading cities and towns in the rear or at the front.

The Ukrainian Army’s strategy is driven by defending large cities with operations based in more or less the same locations as before the war. Around the cities falling along the path of the Russian invasion, they are conducting shelling with their artillery and anti-tank missiles. The troops regularly counterattack using mobile combat units with tanks (this was the case around Kharkiv, Chernihiv, and Mykolayiv). All of this is forcing the Russian troops to seek out new pathways for their advance and their supply lines, and waste their energy on blockading cities and, in the future, potentially, on storming them. This slows down (and, in places, even halts) the Russian invasion. However, the overall strategy and military situation for the Ukrainian Army continues to deteriorate .

At the same time, despite expectations to the contrary, two weeks into the war, the battle for the airspace continues. Here, just as it had before the war, the Russian Army has the advantage, but the Ukrainian Army and antiaircraft defenses, despite what Putin has said about them, still exist and are even capable of operating, albeit in a limited capacity . Maintaining battle-ready Ukrainian antiaircraft systems (capable at least of defensive use) has so far meant that the more Russia has tried to deploy its aerial forces, the greater its losses.

The inability to gain total supremacy in the air while being significantly richer in resources is probably related to Russia’s problems with organizing reconnaissance. Moscow finds itself in this situation despite the fact that the Ukrainian military has experienced no fewer problems with its Air Force and air defenses (including some losses likely caused by friendly fire).
