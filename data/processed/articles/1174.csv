1:43 P.M. EST

THE PRESIDENT: Sorry to keep you waiting. Good afternoon. The Russian military has begun a brutal assault on the people of Ukraine without provocation, without justification, without necessity.

This is a premeditated attack. Vladimir Putin has been planning this for months, as I’ve been — as we’ve been saying all along. He moved more than 175,000 troops, military equipment into positions along the Ukrainian border.

He moved blood supplies into position and built a field hospital, which tells you all you need to know about his intentions all along.

He rejected every good-faith effort the United States and our Allies and partners made to address our mutual security concerns through dialogue to avoid needless conflict and avert human suffering.

For weeks — for weeks, we have been warning that this would happen. And now it’s unfolding largely as we predicted.

In the past week, we’ve seen shelling increase in the Donbas, the region in eastern Ukraine controlled by Russian-backed separatists.

Rus- — the Russian government has perpetrated cyberattacks against Ukraine.

We saw a staged political theater in Moscow — outlandish and baseless claims that Ukraine was — Ukraine was about to invade and launch a war against Russia, that Ukraine was prepared to use chemical weapons, that Ukraine committed a genocide — without any evidence.

We saw a flagrant violation of international law in attempting to unilaterally create two new so-called republics on sovereign Ukrainian territory.

And at the very moment that the United Nations Security Council was meeting to stand up for Ukraine’s sovereignty to stave off invasion, Putin declared his war.

Within moments — moments, missile strikes began to fall on historic cities across Ukraine.

Then came in the air raids, followed by tanks and troops rolling in.

We’ve been transparent with the world. We’ve shared declassified evidence about Russia’s plans and cyberattacks and false pretexts so that there can be no confusion or cover-up about what Putin was doing.

Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences.

Today, I’m authorizing additional strong sanctions and new limitations on what can be exported to Russia.

This is going to impose severe costs on the Russian economy, both immediately and over time.

We have purposefully designed these sanctions to maximize the long-term impact on Russia and to minimize the impact on the United States and our Allies.

And I want to be clear: The United States is not doing this alone. For months, we’ve been building a coalition of partners representing well more than half of the global economy.

Twenty-seven members of the European Union, including France, Germany, Italy — as well as the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and many others — to amplify the joint impact of our response.

I just spoke with the G7 leaders this morning, and we are in full and total agreement. We will limit Russia’s ability to do business in Dollars, Euros, Pounds, and Yen to be part of the global economy. We will limit their ability to do that. We are going to stunt the ability to finance and grow Rus- — the Russian military.

We’re going to impose major — and we’re going to impair their ability to compete in a high-tech 21st century economy.

We’ve already seen the impact of our actions on Russia’s currency, the Ruble, which early today hit its weakest level ever — ever in history. And the Russian stock market plunged today. The Russian government’s borrowing rate spiked by over 15 percent.

In today’s actions, we have now sanctioned Russian banks that together hold around $1 trillion in assets.

We’ve cut off Russia’s largest bank — a bank that holds more than one third of Russia’s banking assets by itself — cut it off from the U.S. financial system.

And today, we’re also blocking four more major banks. That means every asset they have in America will be frozen. This includes V.T.B., the second-largest bank in Russia, which has $250 billion in assets.

As promised, we’re also adding names to the list of Russian elites and their family members that are sanctioning — that we’re sanctioning as well.

As I said on Tuesday, these are people who personally gain from the Kremlin’s policies and they should share in the pain. We will keep up this drumbeat of those designations against corrupt billionaires in the days ahead.

On Tuesday, we stopped the Russian government from raising money from U.S. or European investors.

Now, we’re going to apply the same restrictions to Russia’s largest state-owned enterprises — companies with assets that exceed $1.4 trillion.

Some of the most powerful impacts of our actions will come over time as we squeeze Russia’s access to finance and technology for strategic sectors of its economy and degrade its industrial capacity for years to come.

Between our actions and those of our Allies and partners, we estimate that we’ll cut off more than half of Russia’s high-tech imports.

It will strike a blow to their ability to continue to modernize their military. It’ll degrade their aerospace industry, including their space program. It will hurt their ability to build ships, reducing their ability to compete economically. And it will be a major hit to Putin’s long-term strategic ambitions.

And we’re preparing to do more. In addition to the economic penalties we’re imposing, we’re also taking steps to defend our NATO Allies, particularly in the east.

Tomorrow, NATO will convene a summit — we’ll be there — to bring together the leaders of 30 Allied nations and close partners to affirm our solidarity and to map out the next steps we will take to further strengthen all aspects of our NATO Alliance.

Although we provided over $650 million in defensive assistance to Ukraine just this year — this last year, let me say it again: Our forces are not and will not be engaged in the conflict with Russia in Ukraine. Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine but to defend our NATO Allies and reassure those Allies in the east.

As I made crystal clear, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power. And the good news is: NATO is more united and more determined than ever.

There is no doubt — no doubt that the United States and every NATO Ally will meet our Article 5 commitments, which says that an attack on one is an attack on all.

Over the past few weeks, I ordered thousands of additional forces to Germany and Poland as part of our commitment to NATO.

On Tuesday, in response to Russia’s aggressive action, including its troop presence in Belarus and the Black Sea, I’ve authorized the deployment of ground and air forces already stationed in Europe to NATO’s eastern flank Allies: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Romania.

Our Allies have also been stepping up, adding — the other Allies, the rest of NATO — adding their own forces and capabilities to ensure our collective defense.

And today, within hours of Russia’s unleashing its assault, NATO came together and authorized and activated — an activation of response plans.

This will enable NATO’s high-readiness forces to deploy and — when and where they’re needed to protect our NATO Allies on the eastern boundaries of Europe.

And now I’m authorizing additional U.S. forces and capabilities to deploy to Germany as part of NATO’s response, including some of U.S.-based forces that the Department of Defense placed on standby weeks ago.

I’ve also spoken with Defense Secretary Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Milley, about preparations for additional moves should they become necessary to protect our NATO Allies and support the greatest military Alliance in the history of the world — NATO.

As we respond, my administration is using the tools — every tool at our disposal to protect American families and businesses from rising prices at the gas pump.

You know, we’re taking active steps to bring down the costs. And American oil and gas companies should not — should not exploit this moment to hike their prices to raise profits.

You know, in our sanctions package, we specifically designed to allow energy payments to continue.

We are closely monitoring energy supplies for any disruption. We have been coordinating with major oil producing and consuming countries toward our common interest to secure global energy supplies.

We are actively working with countries around the world to elevate [evaluate] a collective release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserves of major energy-consuming countries. And the United States will release additional barrels of oil as conditions warrant.

I know this is hard and that Americans are already hurting. I will do everything in my power to limit the pain the American people are feeling at the gas pump. This is critical to me.

But this aggression cannot go unanswered. If it did, the consequences for America would be much worse. America stands up to bullies. We stand up for freedom. This is who we are.

Let me also repeat the warning I made last week: If Russia pursues cyberattacks against our companies, our critical infrastructure, we are prepared to respond.

For months, we have been working closely with our private — with the private sector to harden their cyber defenses, sharpen our ability to respond to Russian cyberattacks as well.

I spoke late last night to President Zelenskyy of Ukraine and I assured him that the United States, together with our Allies and partners in Europe, will support the Ukrainian people as they defend their country. We’ll provide humanitarian relief to ease their suffering.

And in the early days of this conflict, Russian propaganda outlets will keep trying to hide the truth and claim success for its military operation against a made-up threat.

But history has shown time and again how swift gains in territory eventually give way to grinding occupations, acts of mass civil — mass civil disobedience, and strategic dead-ends.

The next few weeks and months will be hard on the people of Ukraine. Putin has unleashed a great pain on them. But the Ukrainian people have known 30 years of independence, and they have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.

This is a dangerous moment for all of Europe, for the freedom around the world. Putin has a — has committed an assault on the very principles that uphold global peace.

But now the entire world sees clearly what Putin and his Kremlin — and his Kremlin allies are really all about. This was never about genuine security concerns on their part. It was always about naked aggression, about Putin’s desire for empire by any means necessary — by bullying Russia’s neighbors through coercion and corruption, by changing borders by force, and, ultimately, by choosing a war without a cause.

Putin’s actions betray his sinister vision for the future of our world — one where nations take what they want by force.

But it is a vision that the United States and freedom-loving nations everywhere will oppose with every tool of our considerable power.

The United States and our Allies and partners will emerge from this stronger, more united, more determined, and more purposeful.

And Putin’s aggression against Ukraine will end up costing Russia dearly — economically and strategically. We will make sure of that. Putin will be a pariah on the international stage. Any nation that countenances Russia’s naked aggression against Ukraine will be stained by association.

When the history of this era is written, Putin’s choice to make a totally unjustifiable war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.

Liberty, democracy, human dignity — these are the forces far more powerful than fear and oppression. They cannot be extinguished by tyrants like Putin and his armies. They cannot be erased by people — from people’s hearts and hopes by any amount of violence and intimidation. They endure.

And in the contest between democracy and autocracy, between sovereignty and subjugation, make no mistake: Freedom will prevail.

God bless the people of a free and democratic Ukraine. And may God protect our troops.

Q President Biden —

THE PRESIDENT: Associated Press, Zeke.

Q Chris Megerian. So, do you have any plans to speak with President Putin at this point? And what interactions have you had with the Russian government?

THE PRESIDENT: I heard the first part: Do I have any plans to speak with Putin at this point. And what?

Q What communications have you had with the Kremlin as far as military (inaudible) in Ukraine and making sure this does not spiral into a larger conflict?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, it’s a large conflict already. The way we’re going to assure it’s not going to spiral to a larger conflict is by providing all the forces needed in the Eastern European nations that are members of NATO. NATO is more united than it’s ever been.

And I have no plans to talk with Putin.

Wall Street Journal, Tarina [Tarini].

Q Mr. President, you didn’t mention SWIFT in your sanctions that you announced. Is there a reason why the U.S. isn’t doing that? Is there disagreement among Allies regarding SWIFT and whether Russia should be allowed to be a part of it?

THE PRESIDENT: The sanctions that we have proposed on all their banks is of equal consequence — maybe more consequence than SWIFT — number one.

Number two, it is always an option. But right now, that’s not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take.

Cecilia Ve- — Vega, ABC.

Q Thank you, sir. Sir, sanctions clearly have not been enough to deter Vladimir Putin to this point. What is going to stop him? How and when does this end? And do you see him trying to go beyond Ukraine?

And a second question I’ll just give to you now: This statement that he gave last night will — that the We- — the threat that he gave — the West “will face consequences greater than any you have faced in history.” Is he threatening a nuclear strike?

THE PRESIDENT: I have no idea what he’s threatening. I know what he has done, number one.

And number two, no one expected the sanctions to prevent anything from happening. That has to sh- — this is going to take time. And we have to show resolve so he knows what’s coming and so the people of Russia know what he’s brought on them. That’s what this is all about.

This is going to take time. It’s not going to occur — he’s going to say, “Oh my God, these sanctions are coming. I’m going to stand down.”

He’s going to test the resolve of the West to see if we stay together. And we will. We will and it will impose significant costs on him.

Q Will he go beyond Ukraine, sir? Do you see him going beyond Ukraine?

Q Mr. President — Mr. President —

THE PRESIDENT: (Points to reporter.) Yes.

Q Thank you. Two topics, just really quick. First, markets are down and gas prices are up. I know you always stress the difference between Wall Street and Main Street, but everybody seems to be in for some economic pain. How economically painful is it going to get for people in this country?

And I do have one more question.

THE PRESIDENT: First of all, there’s no doubt that when a major nuclear power attacks and invades another country that the world is going to respond and markets are going to respond all over the world. So, there’s no doubt about that, number one.

Number two, the notion that this is going to last for a long time is highly unlikely, as long as we continue to stay resolved in imposing the sanctions we’re going to impose on Russia, period.

What’s your next question? I’m sorry.

Q The next question is: Did you underestimate Putin? And would you still describe him the way that you did in the summer, as a “worthy adversary”?

THE PRESIDENT: At the time, he was — I made it clear he was an adversary, and I said he was “worthy.” I didn’t underestimate him.

And I’ve read most of everything he’s written. Did you read the — I shouldn’t sa- — I’m not being a wise guy. The — you heard the speech he made — almost an hour’s worth of speeches — why he was going into Ukraine.

He has much larger ambitions in Ukraine. He wants to, in fact, reestablish the former Soviet Union. That’s what this is about.

And I think that his — his ambitions are — are completely contrary to the place where the rest of the world has arrived.

Q President Biden — President Biden —

Q And — and with that — with his ambitions, you’re confident that these devastating sanctions are going to be as devastating as Russian missiles and bullets and tanks?

THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Russian bullets, missiles, and tanks in Ukraine. Yes, I am.

Q Thank you, President Biden. If sanctions cannot stop President Putin, what penalty can?

THE PRESIDENT: I didn’t say sanctions couldn’t stop him.

Q But you’ve been talking about the threat of these sanctions for several weeks now —

THE PRESIDENT: Yes, but the threat of the sanctions and imposing the sanctions and seeing the effect of the sanctions are two different things.

Q Okay, but —

THE PRESIDENT: They’re two different things. And we’re now going to — he’s going to begin to see the effect of the sanctions.

Q And what will that do — how will that change his mindset here, given he’s attacking Ukraine as we speak?

THE PRESIDENT: Because it will so weaken his country that he’ll have to make a very, very difficult choices of whether to continue to move toward being a second-rate power or, in fact, respond.

Q You said, in recent weeks, that big nations cannot bluff when it comes to something like this. You recently said that the idea of personally sanctioning President Putin was on the table. Is that a step that you’re prepared to take? And if not —

THE PRESIDENT: It’s not a bluff; it’s on the table.

Q Sanctioning President Putin?

THE PRESIDENT: Yes.

Q Why not sanction him today, sir? Why not sanction him today, sir?

Q Mr. President —

Q Mr. President, if I can, you detailed some severe and swift new sanctions today and said the impact it will have over time, but given the full-scale invasion, given that you’re not pursuing disconnecting Russia from what’s called “SWIFT” — the international banking system — or other sanctions at your disposal, respectfully, sir, what more are you waiting for?

THE PRESIDENT: Specifically, the sanctions we’ve imposed exceed SWIFT. The sanctions we imposed exceed anything that’s ever been done. The sanctions we imposed have generated two thirds of the world joining us. They are profound sanctions. Let’s have a conversation in another month or so to see if they’re working.

Yes.

Q Let me ask you about — can I ask you about Zelenskyy? Sir, you spoke to Volodymyr Zelenskyy yesterday, sir, if I could follow up —

Q What’s the risk that we are watching the beginning of another Cold War? And is there now a complete rupture in U.S. and Russian relations?

THE PRESIDENT: There is a complete rupture right now in U.S.-Russian relations if they continue on this path that they’re on.

And in terms of a Cold War, that depends. You have the vast majority of the rest of the world in total opposition to what he’s doing — from Asia to South America to Europe to acr- — around the world.

And so, it’s going to be a cold day for Russia. The idea — you don’t see a whole lot of people coming to his defense.

Q And are you — are you — if I could follow-up, sir. Are you urging China to help isolate Russia? Are you urging China to help isolate Russia?

THE PRESIDENT: I’m not prepared to comment on that at the moment.

(Cross-talk by reporters.)

Q Mr. President —

THE PRESIDENT: Wait. No, no. (Points to reporter.) Yeah.

No, no, no. He’s had his hand up a long time.

Q Thank you, Mr. President. How concerned are you that Putin wants to go beyond Ukraine into other countries and the U.S. will have to get involved if he moves into NATO countries?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, if he did move into NATO countries, he will be involved — we will be involved. The only thing that I’m convinced of is: If we don’t stop now, he’ll be emboldened. If we don’t move against him now with these significant sanctions, he will be emboldened.

Look, you know, every — well, anyway.

Q And can you talk anything more about your conversation —

(Cross-talk by reporters.)

THE PRESIDENT: I’m sorry, I can’t hear you.

Q Sir, India, which is a major defense partner of the United States — is India with — fully with you on the issue of Ukraine and Russia?

THE PRESIDENT: Does the Defense Department of the United States —

Q Sir, India is one of your major defense partners. Is India fully in sync with United States on Russia?

THE PRESIDENT: We’re going to be — we’re in consultation with — with India today. We haven’t resolved that completely.

Q One more question —

(Cross-talk by reporters.)

THE PRESIDENT: Okay, thank you all very much. Thank you.

2:05 P.M. EST",https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/02/24/remarks-by-president-biden-on-russias-unprovoked-and-unjustified-attack-on-ukraine/
1,5fe2b112-5d84-46cb-a6bc-f217a94595b5,"['Jeremy Herb', 'Donald Judd', 'Phil Mattingly']",2022-02-23 00:00:00,"(CNN) US President Joe Biden condemned Russia's ""unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces"" in a statement Wednesday evening following explosions in Ukraine.

The US and allies are planning on Thursday to trigger the ""full scale"" of the sanctions that have been discussed over the last several weeks in response to the attack, according to a senior Biden administration official.

""President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering,"" Biden said. ""Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable.""

The White House statement came in response to explosions across Ukraine, including in the capital of Kyiv. Shortly before the explosions began, Russian President Vladmir Putin announced a ""special military operation"" and called for Ukraine's ""demilitarization"" in televised remarks.

An adviser for the interior minister of Ukraine, Anton Gerashchenko, said Russia's ""invasion has begun"" with ""missile strikes on Kyiv,"" in an official WhatsApp group with journalists.

The early assessment from the US is that this is the start of the full Russian invasion, according to a senior US official familiar with the latest US intelligence. The source said the belief is that the explosions heard near Kyiv and Odessa are likely missiles, while those around Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine are likely artillery, given the proximity to the border.

Biden held a secure call with members of his national security team from the White House Wednesday evening, White House press secretary Jen Psaki tweeted . Biden was joined by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley and national security adviser Jake Sullivan, she said.

Biden also spoke by phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In a statement on the call, Biden said he briefed Zelensky ""on the steps we are taking to rally international condemnation, including tonight at the United Nations Security Council.""

""He asked me to call on the leaders of the world to speak out clearly against President Putin's flagrant aggression, and to stand with the people of Ukraine,"" Biden said.

In an address Thursday morning in Ukraine, Zelensky said he was introducing martial law across the country and urged Ukrainians to remain calm.

""No panic. We are strong. We are ready for everything,"" he said. ""We will win over everybody because we are Ukraine.""

Biden said that he planned to speak to his G-7 counterparts and would give a speech to the American people on Thursday. He said he intended to announce ""further consequences"" that the US and its allies planned to impose on Russia over ""this needless act of aggression against Ukraine and global peace and security.""

""We will also coordinate with our NATO Allies to ensure a strong, united response that deters any aggression against the Alliance,"" Biden said.

While the administration official declined to lay out specifics, the US has planned to target Russia's two largest banks, as well as other financial firms, and has prepared to deploy export controls to cut off Russian access to critical Western technology for entire Russian economic sectors.

Additional members of Putin's inner circle and their families are also likely to be targeted.

Discussions were ongoing late Wednesday evening between US and European officials about the final shape of the package, the official said. It will also be a topic of discussion at the virtual G-7 meeting that has been scheduled, the official said.

US officials remain on high alert for any cyber activity against key domestic targets including banks and critical infrastructure, the official said.

Biden's national security team plans to brief the House and Senate in separate, unclassified phone calls Thursday on the situation in Ukraine. Lawmakers from both parties roundly condemned Russia's actions in statements Wednesday and called for the US to ramp up sanctions against Moscow.

UN meeting as explosions begin

The UN Security Council held an emergency meeting on Wednesday evening in New York -- offering a remarkable split screen as the diplomats delivered speeches at the same time Putin's speech aired on Russian television and the explosions began in Ukraine. Ukraine's Ambassador to the United Nations

Sergiy Kyslytsya directly questioned Russia's representative in his speech.

""About 48 minutes ago, your President declared war on Ukraine,"" Kyslytsya said. ""You declared the war. It is the responsibility of this body to stop the war.""

US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield spoke for a second time as the UN meeting was nearing an end, stating Putin had ""delivered a message of war"" while the Security Council was meeting. She said the US would introduce a resolution in the UN on Thursday.

""At the exact time as we are gathered in the Council seeking peace, Putin delivered a message of war in total disdain for the responsibility of this council,"" Thomas-Greenfield said.

As the final speaker of the meeting, Kyslytsya turned his attention again to Russia's UN ambassador, Vasily Nebenzya, who was acting as president of the Security Council.

""I welcome the decision of some members of this council to meet as soon as possible to consider the necessary decision that would condemn the aggression that you launch on my people,"" Kyslytsya said. ""There is no purgatory for war criminals. They go straight to hell, Ambassador.""

Nebenzya shot back by claiming Moscow wasn't being aggressive against the Ukrainian people but against the ""junta"" in power in Kyiv, before hastily gaveling an end to the UN meeting.

Franco Ordoñez, Brian Naylor | NPR

President Biden issued a new round of economic sanctions Thursday meant to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for attacking Ukraine.

""Putin is the aggressor,"" Biden said in remarks at the White House. ""Putin chose this war and now he and his country will bear the consequences.""

Biden said the U.S. will block four additional Russian banks, including the two largest — Sberbank and VTB — from having access to the U.S. financial system and limit Russia's ability to import Western technology. He said the actions will hamper Russia's ability to do business ""in dollars, pounds, euros and yen.""

""The U.S. stands up to bullies,"" Biden said. ""We stand up to freedom.""

Biden repeated that U.S. troops will not be deployed to Ukraine, but reiterated that he has sent ""thousands of additional forces to Germany and Poland"" to protect NATO's eastern flank. Biden said NATO will convene a summit on Friday and that ""we'll be there to bring together the leaders of 30 allied nations and close partners to affirm our solidarity.""

""This is a dangerous moment for all of Europe,"" Biden said.

""If we don't move against him [Putin] now with these significant sanctions, he will be in Poland,"" Biden predicted.

Biden said he understood the effects on Americans of Russia's invasion

Biden vowed that he ""will do everything in my power to alleviate the pain"" that Americans are feeling at the gas pump as oil prices spike. But, he said, ""this aggression cannot go unanswered.""

Biden said that the U.S. and its allies would not take the step of keeping Russia from using the SWIFT system for global banking transactions because Europe did not want to, but he said it would be held in reserve.

Putin, he said, ""has much larger ambitions than Ukraine,"" adding that he thinks the Russian president wants to reestablish the Soviet Union. ""If we don't move against him now with these significant sanctions,"" Biden said, ""he will be emboldened.""

The White House has been saying for weeks that its threat of sanctions was aimed at deterring an invasion. But on Thursday, Biden said the sanctions were not expected to prevent one. Instead, he said, it would take time to have the intended impact: weakening Russia's economy.

Biden also again warned Putin against conducting cyberattacks against U.S. companies and infrastructure, vowing ""we are prepared to respond.""

Biden said Putin ""will be a pariah on the international stage""

Biden said he spoke Wednesday night with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and promised him the U.S. would provide humanitarian aid. Biden said Putin has ""unleashed a great pain"" on the Ukrainian people.

This morning, I met with my G7 counterparts to discuss President Putin’s unjustified attack on Ukraine and we agreed to move forward on devastating packages of sanctions and other economic measures to hold Russia to account. We stand with the brave people of Ukraine. pic.twitter.com/dzvYxj7J9w — President Biden (@POTUS) February 24, 2022

The Treasury Department said in a statement that on a daily basis, Russian financial institutions conduct about $46 billion worth of foreign exchange transactions globally, 80% of which are in U.S. dollars. ""The vast majority of those transactions will now be disrupted,"" according to the statement. ""The Russian financial institutions subject to today's action can no longer benefit from the remarkable reach, efficiency, and security of the U.S. financial system.""

Payments for energy will be allowed, the Treasury Department confirmed, as well as payments for agricultural and medical commodities.

Six Russian individuals were added to the sanctions list — two banking executives and four family members of other officials deemed close to Putin.

New sanctions take aim at cutting Russia off from critical technology

The Commerce Department on Thursday unveiled its new export controls for Russia, saying that semiconductors, computers, telecommunications, information security equipment, lasers and sensors would be subject to the new bans. In addition, 49 Russian military end users were added to a control list.

The department said similar measures would be taken by the EU, Japan, Australia, United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand, and that more countries were expected to join.

Thursday's sanctions follow measures Biden announced Tuesday. The first wave of sanctions against Russia targeted two Russian financial institutions along with the government's ability to access Western financing. There were also sanctions against the Russian-owned company building the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline.

Biden has warned that these were the first ""tranche"" of sanctions and that the administration would ratchet up the response based on Russia's next steps. Senior administration officials say the group of Russian elites and their family members who are being sanctioned have ""shared in the corrupt gains of the Kremlin, and they will now share in the pain.""

The update from Biden comes as a wave of ongoing air strikes and Russian troop deployments have led to dozens of deaths across Ukraine, which Putin claimed he has no plans to occupy after “recognizing” rebel-held eastern regions and falsely suggesting the former Soviet republic isn’t a sovereign nation.

On Thursday morning, Putin announced plans to demilitarize and “denazify” Ukraine — a claim that experts quickly denounced as preposterous, as Russian troops and tanks poured into a country with a democratically elected Jewish president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

“There is no purgatory for war criminals. They go straight to hell,” Sergiy Kyslytsya, the Ukrainian Ambassador to the United Nations, told the U.N. Security Council, in remarks directed at his Russian counterpart Wednesday night as airstrikes started to pound his country.

60 The Russian Invasion of Ukraine

Biden’s address can be watched here at MassLive through the above White House YouTube feed.

Ukraine won its independence in 1991.

Earlier this week, Putin asserted that Ukraine only exists because of Russia, which belies both countries’ long and complex histories and is at odds with the international community’s recognition of Ukraine.

Russia had ramped up its military presence around Ukraine’s borders for months, claiming to conduct military exercises and denying it planned any invasion.

U.S. intelligence officials, Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Pentagon leaders increasingly warned for weeks that the Kremlin planned to use disinformation and propaganda as a pretext for war.

On Thursday morning, Putin claimed that the newly “recognized” Russian-backed republics in Eastern Ukraine requested Russia’s help to face Ukrainian aggression, and that in response he’d decided to conduct a “special military operation.” U.S. officials and European leaders say there was no Ukrainian aggression and point to Russia’s unprovoked military buildup and continued false statements from the Kremlin.

Zelenskyy said he tried to call Putin days ago to re-engage in diplomacy, but Putin never responded. Zelenskyy pledged to fully defend Ukraine, which is not a member of the European Union or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

The Biden administration and European allies have already announced punishing economic sanctions for Russia, which also was hit with severe sanctions after it rolled into the Crimean peninsula in 2014 and took control of the region from Ukraine.

Putin warned Western leaders Thursday: “To anyone who would consider interfering from the outside — if you do, you will face consequences greater than any you have faced in history.”

Biden on Thursday morning met with the Group of 7 conference of industrialized nations to discuss the joint response to the unprovoked attack.

“The prayers of the entire world are with the people of Ukraine tonight as they suffer an unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces,” Biden said Wednesday night. “President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering. Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable.”

In a statement provided by the White House after a phone call with Zelenskyy, Biden said again that he’d pledged severe sanctions against Russia and continued support for the Ukrainian people.

“[Zelenskyy] asked me to call on the leaders of the world to speak out clearly against President Putin’s flagrant aggression, and to stand with the people of Ukraine,” he said.

Why would Russia want to take Chernobyl? Few places conjure more foreboding than Chernobyl, the site of the deadly 1986 nuclear disaster. So alarm bells rang in the West when Russian forces seized the decommissioned power plant in the early hours of their invasion of Ukraine on Thursday. Why would Russia make a radioactive wasteland one of its very first targets in Ukraine? While the full answer may be known only to top officials in Moscow, the site happens to lie along one of the most direct paths to Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. “The location is important because of where it sits,” retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, former commanding general of U.S. Army Europe, said in an interview. ""If Russian forces were attacking Kyiv from the north, Chernobyl is right there on the way, almost in the way."" Chernobyl is less than 10 miles from Ukraine's border with Belarus, a Russian ally where Moscow has been massing troops in preparation for its attack on Ukraine. From there, it's a relatively straight shot of about 80 miles south to Kyiv. Read the full story here. Share this -







Russia sanctions are a ‘big deal,’ experts say. But effects could take years. The flurry of sanctions the U.S. announced this week against Russia are some of the hardest-hitting that Moscow has ever faced, but the slow pain they inflict may not be enough to deter Putin from escalating his invasion of Ukraine, experts said. Biden and several U.S. allies, including the European Union, the United Kingdom and Japan, have vowed to review further restrictions on Moscow as punishment for the invasion. The sanctions that have already been announced are significant in size and scope, said former Treasury and State Department officials who handled U.S. sanctions in the past, but the longtime U.S. reliance on the national security tool has left the U.S. with few other options if Putin and Russia do not respond. Nevertheless, the Russian economy is already feeling the effects of war, and the sanctions could over time further cause the Russian stock market to falter, deflate the value of the ruble — which hit an all-time low Thursday — and make doing business in Russia increasingly difficult. “We’re counting a lot on sanctions, and the ones the Biden administration have put together are really pretty tough,” said Daniel Fried, a longtime diplomat and former ambassador to Poland who helped lead the West’s 2014 response to Moscow’s aggression against Ukraine as the State Department coordinator for sanctions policy. He called the recent sanctions ""a big deal."" Read the full story here. Share this -







Russia says it will support banks under sanctions Russia said its central bank will support banks affected by the sanctions the U.S. and other countries imposed this week. Leaders in Europe, Canada and the U.S. announced Thursday that they are committed to issuing severe economic sanctions following Putin's decision to attack Ukraine. Biden took aim at Putin by mounting pressure through Russia's economy, including the two largest majority state-owned institutions, Sberbank and VTB. Russia issued a statement through its central bank assuring that the state has a plan to remain functioning regardless of the sanctions. ""All operations of banks in rubles will be carried out, and the corresponding services will be provided to all customers as usual,"" the statement said. ""All customer funds in foreign currencies are also held and can be withdrawn in the account currency. The Bank of Russia is ready to support banks with funds in rubles and foreign currency."" A majority of the bank's balance at each bank is measured in rubles, the statement insists, and ""maintain a high margin of stability."" Share this -







Some Russians share black squares on social media to indicate anti-war stance Some well-known Russians have posted black squares on social media to publicly indicate their opposition to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Black squares were shared to show solidarity with the protests in the U.S. after the death of George Floyd nearly two years ago. And Thursday, many Russians appeared to use the same tactic to show their support for the country's anti-war movement. Television host and comedian Ivan Urgant posted “Fear and pain. NO to war"" on Instagram, alongside a black square, for his 9.9 million followers. Maxim Galkin, a Russian singer and comedian, posted the same black square for his 9.4 million Instagram followers, writing: ""There can be no justification for war! No War!"" Two-time Olympic figure skating silver medalist Evgenia Medvedevа wrote over a black background on her Instagram story, ""I hope this all ends as soon as possible, like a bad dream,"" placing a white dove emoji below the text for her 1.3 million followers. Former television host Xenia Sobchak, whose father was a mentor to Putin, posted the black square to Instagram for her millions of followers. ""We are all now locked in this situation. No exit. We, the Russians, will be dealing with the consequences of today for many years to come,"" she wrote. Share this -

Conductor Valery Gergiev, a Putin supporter, replaced ahead of Carnegie Hall performance Russian conductor Valery Gergiev, a known friend and supporter of Putin’s, will no longer lead a series of concerts this weekend at Carnegie Hall. Carnegie Hall and the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra announced Thursday that the Canadian conductor Yannick Nézet-Séguin will step in for Gergiev, leading the orchestra in three concerts at Carnegie Hall from Friday through Sunday. No reason was cited for Gergiev’s removal from the program; his relationship with Putin reflects the global denunciation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Daniel Froschauer, the orchestra’s chairman, called Gergiev a gifted artist and said he would take the podium for the Carnegie dates. “He’s going as a performer, not a politician,” Froschauer said. Carnegie Hall and the orchestra also said the Russian pianist Denis Matsuev, who had been scheduled to perform with Gergiev and the orchestra Friday, would not appear. Share this -







Russian forces have moved closer to Kyiv, fired more than 160 missiles, says U.S. defense official Russia has launched more than 160 missiles since it began striking Ukraine, a senior U.S. defense official said. Russian troops, meanwhile, have moved closer to Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, the official said Thursday, adding that the country has also sent additional airborne troops to Kharkiv, where fighting is ongoing. As part of its response to Russia's aggression and in support of its NATO allies, the U.S will deploy 7,000 more troops to Germany from Fort Carson, Colorado, the Defense Department said.

U.S. sanctions also target Belarus for supporting Russia The new round of sanctions against Russia that Biden unveiled Thursday also targets another country: Belarus. The measures take aim at Belarusian state-owned banks and the country's defense and security industries, as well as a number of its ""regime-connected officials and elites,"" for their support of Russia's invasion, according to the Treasury Department. The White House said in a statement, ""We call on Belarus to withdraw its support for Russian aggression in Ukraine."" Biden announced the latest round of sanctions just hours after the United Kingdom slapped similar sanctions on Belarus, as well as Russia. Other U.S. allies are expected to follow suit. Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus and a close ally of Putin's, said Thursday that troops from his country could be used in further Russian military operations in Ukraine if necessary, local media reported.

U.S. expels No. 2 ranking Russian diplomat The second-highest ranking Russian diplomat is being expelled from the U.S. in retaliation for a similar move made by Russia earlier this month, a senior State Department official told NBC News Thursday. Sergey Trepelkov is the second-highest ranking diplomat at the Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C., under Ambassador Antoly Antonov. The move is not a response to the Ukraine invasion, the State Department official said, but is instead a counter to Russia ousting U.S. Deputy Chief of Mission Bart Gorman earlier this month. Gorman had not completed his three-year diplomatic tour before being told to leave Russia. “We believe it is critical that our countries have the necessary diplomatic personnel in place to facilitate communication between our governments,” the official said. “However, we will not let actions like this go without a response and today, we have announced our response.” Share this -

Putin using false 'Nazi' narrative in attack on Ukraine, experts say Putin peddled accusations of Nazi elements within Ukraine on Thursday to justify the Russian attack, a move that experts slammed as slanderous and false. In announcing he had launched Russian forces against key Ukrainian military and logistics posts, Putin said he's striving for ""the demilitarization and denazification"" of the sovereign democracy in Kyiv. David Harris, the CEO of the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group, said he's confident that Putin's Nazi narrative ""won't work."" ""First, Ukraine is led by a Jewish president, who was overwhelmingly chosen by voters in a democratic election. It reflects today's Ukrainian mindset and outlook, a far cry from the past,"" Harris said. ""And second, the ones behaving like Nazis are, let's be clear, Putin and his regime. Brazenly invading another country, invoking fake grievances, lying incessantly and denying another nation's right to chart its own destiny are all, yes, taken from the Nazi playbook.""

European leaders not interested in pulling Russia out of SWIFT, Biden says Pulling Russia out of the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or SWIFT, is not an option European leaders are currently pursuing, Biden told reporters on Thursday. ""The sanctions that were proposed on all their banks have equal consequence — maybe more consequences — than SWIFT number one,"" Biden said. ""Number two, it is always an option. But right now, that's not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take."" SWIFT is a secure messaging system that links more than 11,000 financial institutions in over 200 countries and territories. Removing Russia from the coalition would prevent the country from making most international transactions but could also hurt other economies. Share this -

Biden announces stronger round of sanctions against Russia Biden on Thursday announced a new, stronger round of sanctions against Russia in response to the nation’s invasion of Ukraine that he said are designed to “maximize the long-term impact” on the country. “Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences,” Biden said during a speech from the White House. The sanctions, undertaken in conjunction with U.S. allies, will “stunt the ability to grow and finance” the Russian military and will include new limits on what can be exported to Russia. 'Putin is the aggressor': Biden announces sanctions in response to Russian attacks on Ukraine Feb. 24, 2022 04:23 The new round of sanctions will target four additional major Russian Banks, including VTB, a state-owned bank in Russia and the second-largest bank in Russia.

Biden added that the U.S. and its allies would add names to the list of Russian elites and their family members” who have already been targeted individually with sanctions. Share this -

On TikTok, livestreams show protests — and attract scams Livestreams on TikTok are bringing a first-person view of the conflict from all over Europe — but some of the streams purporting to come from Ukraine appeared to be fake. Some of the livestreams appear to be authentic, showing crowds gathered in major cities to protest Russian aggression. But other TikTok users are pretending to be in Ukraine, using doctored or dubbed footage of other places in an attempt to solicit followers and monetary donations. One account, which called for donations through TikTok, featured a livestream of a line of houses in a residential area as the sounds of gunshots, sirens and people screaming for help could be heard in the background. But that account hours earlier had posted a different angle of the same street in which cars with U.K. license plates were visible. Other videos posted to TikTok appear to be recycling old video and passing it off as coming from Ukraine. In one video viewed almost 20 million times on TikTok and posted about two hours after the first reports of shellings in Ukraine, a soldier is seen parachuting out of an airplane. “Bro is recording an invasion,” the top comment reads. The video is from a training exercise, first posted to an Instagram account by a user with the same username on April 6, 2016. The user on TikTok was seen later on Tuesday livestreaming on his couch.

More than 100 Russian missiles – including short range ballistic missiles, medium range ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, surface to air missiles and sea missiles launched from the Black Sea – were fired in the initial salvo, the official said. Targets have so far been military and air defenses, barracks, ammunition depots, and 10 airfields, the official said, adding that there is no clear understanding of the level of casualties on either side.

Ukraine invasion jeopardizes U.S.-Russia space cooperation Russia's invasion of Ukraine is already causing tension in the space community, one of the few global arenas in which the U.S. and Russia still cooperate.

Rogozin also tweeted “Glory to Russia!” on Monday, after Russian President Vladimir Putin gave a televised speech with misleading claims that Ukraine is “historically Russian land” and false claims the country has fallen into the hands of neo-Nazis and corrupt “puppets” controlled by the West.

Russian disinformation, propaganda ramp up as conflict in Ukraine grows Russia’s effort to spread disinformation and propaganda across the internet and through foreign and domestic media about its invasion of Ukraine started weeks ago — and it’s expected to ramp up now that the conflict has begun. Disinformation experts say that they have seen a concerted effort from Russian leaders and state-backed media to push a false narrative around the reasons for invading Ukraine, and that they expect that to continue as both international pressure and even some domestic Russian resistance to war grows. “We’re going to see a huge onslaught,” said Jane Lytvynenko, senior research fellow at Harvard University’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy. “And we need to be prepared for that.” Lytvynenko said people should be prepared for a wide variety of disinformation and propaganda, including the use of authentic images and video to push false narratives.

Russia isolated as 'Iron Curtain' falls down, Zelenskyy says Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy offered citizens details of military resistance in his latest update on Thursday, while continuing to urge Russian citizens to push back in protest against Putin. Zelenskyy praised the work of Ukrainian forces at the Russian border while calling the fight in the southern part of the nation ""complicated"" in remarks posted on Telegram. He also expressed optimism in his country's defense. ""The sounds that we hear today are not only missile strikes, explosions and rockets — it’s the sound of the Iron Curtain falling down and closing Russia from the other civilized world,"" Zelenskyy said. He renewed calls for Ukrainian citizens to aid territorial defense forces, asking anyone with military experience to offer themselves in the effort.

U.S. defense official: Russians 'making a move' on Kyiv The Russian invasion of Ukraine has so far focused on three main axes of assault – all of which have been assessed to have the intention of taking key population centers – and Putin's forces are ""making a move on Kyiv,"" a senior defense official told NBC News. The first axis is a south-to-north approach from Crimea to Kherson; the second axis is a north-central to south approach from Belarus to Kyiv; and the third axis is a northeast to south approach occurring around Kharkiv, where the heaviest fighting is currently occurring, the official said. The official disclosed the information as part of an operational update on the situation in Ukraine. Russia is “making a move on Kyiv,” the official said, adding that the the U.S. assessment of Putin’s actions indicate that Russia has “every intention of basically decapitating the government and installing their own method of governance.” “We have not been surprised so far with what we have seen them do,” the official said. “It is very much in line with what was expected.” Russia’s actions so far indicate that its invasion is still only in its initial phase, the official said. Russia’s military operation will include multiple phases, but the U.S. does not currently know how many phases the invasion will include – or how long the phases will take. Share this -







SWIFT banking system could be used as sanction against Russia. What is it? In recent weeks, President Joe Biden has threatened Russian President Vladimir Putin with ""severe economic consequences"" and sanctions like ""he's never seen"" if Russia invades Ukraine. Now, with Putin taking military action against Ukraine, Biden and U.S. allies may consider imposing one of the harshest financial penalties against Russia: kicking it out of the SWIFT banking system. But doing so, which some financial analysts have likened to a ""nuclear option,"" would be an unprecedented move against one of the world's largest economies. The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or SWIFT, is a cooperative of financial institutions formed in 1973 and headquartered in Belgium. It is overseen by the National Bank of Belgium with cooperation from other major central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve System, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank.

Explosions, sirens heard in Kyiv as Russia launches attacks on key Ukrainian cities Russia launched attacks on multiple cities in Ukraine on Wednesday evening, a decisive escalation after months of military buildup that stirred dire warnings from the United States and its allies.

Journalists in other cities also reported hearing explosions. Putin said he was taking action to “demilitarize” Ukraine because the West had pushed too far in trying to draw the country into the NATO alliance and had threatened Russian-speakers in eastern Ukraine. “I urge you to immediately lay down your weapons and go home,” Putin said, speaking to Ukrainian soldiers during a special televised address.

Sen. Mitt Romney slams Russia, past U.S. foreign policy Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, slammed Russia and past U.S. foreign policy under both Democratic and Republican presidents in a statement late Wednesday night. ""Putin's Ukraine invasion is the first time in 80 years that a great power has moved to conquer a sovereign nation. It is without justification, without provocation and without honor,"" he said. ""Putin's impunity predictably follows our tepid response to his previous horrors in Georgia and Crimea, our naive efforts at a one-sided 'reset,' and the shortsightedness of 'America First.'"" ""The '80s called' and we didn't answer,"" he said, referring to a 2012 presidential debate in which then-President Barack Obama mocked Romney’s suggestion that Russia was America’s greatest threat. “The '80s called and they’re asking for their foreign policy back,” Obama said to Romney, the Republican nominee at the time.

Putin says he is fighting a resurgence of Nazism. That's not true. Putin's rationalization for invading Ukraine includes a claim that he is fighting neo-Nazism. ""It is not surprising that Ukrainian society was faced with the rise of far-right nationalism, which rapidly developed into aggressive Russophobia and neo-Nazism,"" Putin said Monday, suggesting that NATO countries are backing neo-Nazis. While it's true that the Ukrainian National Guard is home to the Azov Battalion — a force populated by neo-Nazis — there is no evidence to suggest widespread support for such extreme-right nationalism in the government, military or electorate. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is Jewish; three of his family members were killed in the Holocaust. In the most recent Ukrainian parliamentary elections in 2019, a coalition of ultranationalist right-wing parties failed to win even a single seat in the Rada, the country's 450-member legislature. And for several years, U.S. appropriations laws have included a provision banning spending in support of the Azov Battalion. But in accusing Ukraine of pro-Nazi sentiment, Putin is playing to generations-old scars from World War II, when his country was allied with the U.S., Britain and other countries in defeating the Axis powers. According to the World War II museum in New Orleans, an estimated 24 million Russians died in that war. Share this -

Senators in both parties condemn Russia’s military action against Ukraine U.S. senators in both parties condemned Russia’s military action against Ukraine on Wednesday night and called for further sanctions against Moscow. “For more than 70 years, we have avoided large-scale war in Europe.

Mark Warner, D-Va., who chairs the Senate intelligence committee, in a statement. “President Biden has already imposed an initial tranche of sanctions, and it is now time for us to up the pain level for the Russian government,"" he said.

Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., a member of the Armed Services Committee, called for additional sanctions as he warned that China will be watching America’s response closely as it eyes Taiwan. “It’s crystal clear Vladimir Putin harbors fantasies of reuniting the Soviet Union, and now he’s translated this fantasy into action. He has absolutely no right to invade Ukraine’s sovereign borders and impose Russia’s will on the freedom-loving people of Ukraine,"" Cramer said in a statement. “We needed sanctions months ago to ward off exactly this type of action. Now that Putin has taken these steps we must implement strong, primary and secondary sanctions immediately,” he added. “Our response here is greater than Russia and Ukraine; what we choose to do will also send a message to China on Taiwan.” Share this -







Trump says Russian aggression in Ukraine happening because of 'rigged election' After Putin announced that Russia would conduct military operations in Ukraine, former President Donald Trump blamed the unrest on the U.S. presidential election.

""It happened because of a rigged election,"" he said, referring to his false claim that the election was stolen from him. Trump, who praised Putin as ""very, very savvy"" in a statement Tuesday, was asked repeatedly how he would handle the crisis but did not answer the question, saying only that he knows Putin ""very well. We had many, many times together. I got along with him fantastically."" He added, ""I don't believe he wanted to do this initially. I think he wanted to do something and negotiate it"" and it ""got worse and worse."" Share this -

'Not thinking about the stock market': Why sanctions are unlikely to stop Putin After months of threats, the United States and its allies moved swiftly to sanction Russia after President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into eastern Ukraine, a move President Joe Biden said amounted to “the beginning of a Russian invasion.” The question now is whether those measures will do anything to damage — or deter — the Russian leader, who has taken Europe to the brink of a devastating new conflict. The first salvo of Western sanctions targeted large Russian banks, oligarchs with close ties to the Kremlin, a key gas pipeline and a host of other individuals. The European Union is set to unveil its own, with reports suggesting they may go even further. But while leaders in Washington, Europe and Asia were able to present a united front against Moscow's aggression, officials and analysts say it's unlikely the sanctions will do anything to deter Putin from pursuing a large-scale invasion of Ukraine.
