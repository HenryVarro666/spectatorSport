Russia-Ukraine war further escalates

The Ukrainian Emergency Ministry released a video showing damaged buildings and destruction in Chernihiv, Ukraine. According to the statement released by the ministry on its Facebook page, shelling hit a residential building, a building at the central market and a kindergarten. There were no causalities, the statement added.

Russian President Vladimir Putin dramatically escalated East-West tensions by ordering Russian nuclear forces be put on high alert on February 27. Further, lambasting the US and the West for making ‚Äúaggressive statements‚Äù against Russia, Putin accused NATO and US of rampant unilateral and tough financial sanctions on his country, as he made efforts to revive Cold War-era influence. This has raised fears of nuclear war as Russian forces encountered strong resistance from Ukrainian Army in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, on the economic front, new crippling Western sanctions have forces Russia's Central Bank to sharply raise its key rate Monday to save the Ruble from collapse.

Amid the mounting pressure, Western nations said they would tighten sanctions and buy and deliver weapons for Ukraine, including Stinger missiles for shooting down helicopters and other aircraft. The European countries will also supply fighter jets to Ukraine, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said.

Meanwhile, Russian forces on Sunday had taken full control of Berdyansk, a Ukrainian city of 100,000 on the Azov Sea coast, Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to Zelenskyy‚Äôs office said. The soldiers made rapid advances towards another city in the south of Ukraine, Kherson, while Mariupol, a port city on the Sea of Azov, braced for an invasion. Russian troops entered capital Kyiv, a city with a population of almost 3 million, while the city's Mayor announced that it was too late to evacuate the civilians, and instead handed weapons and firebombs to anyone willing to fight Russia.",https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/russia-ukraine-crisis/russia-ukraine-war-videos-show-missile-striking-apartment-building-in-ukraines-chernihiv-articleshow.html

Evacuation of civilians - whether by the state or self-organised - does not appear to be safe. Reports of civilians targeted in their cars or on the pavements come from the different regions of Ukraine. In Mariupol, the evacuation collapsed twice as Russian shelling did not stop - according to the Ukrainian authorities.

Many families in Ukraine and abroad are looking for their loved ones in towns like Mariupol, Irpen, Hostomel, Bucha, Sumy, Chernihiv but can't reach them. There is no light, heating or running water in most of those areas. Reports reveal civilians lacking drinking water, food and medication. The mayor of the town of Izum near Odesa reports that its centre has been essentially destroyed.

1.5 million refugees have now left the country, while many others are looking for safe corridors to be able to do so.

8,20b0fda8-852e-4d36-a1f8-5e9789f38350,"['Abc News', 'The Associated Press', 'March']",,"Associated Press journalists are documenting military activity across Ukraine, where disinformation is spiking during a Russian ground and air offensive

KYIV, Ukraine -- Associated Press journalists around Ukraine and beyond are documenting military activity during Russia‚Äôs invasion. With disinformation rife and social media amplifying military claims and counterclaims, determining exactly what is happening is difficult. Here‚Äôs a look at what could be confirmed Monday as Russia‚Äôs military assault on Ukraine was in its fifth day.

DIRECTLY WITNESSED

‚Äî Explosions and gunfire appeared to subside overnight around Kyiv, the capital, before Ukrainian and Russian delegations met Monday on Ukraine‚Äôs border with Belarus.

‚Äî As the talks wrapped up, several blasts could be heard in Kyiv.

‚Äî Russian forces shelled Ukraine‚Äôs second-largest city, Kharkiv. Video showed residential areas being shelled, with apartment buildings shaken by repeated, powerful blasts. Flashes of fire and gray plumes of smoke could be seen.

‚Äî Pro-Russian separatists were taking control of the town of Nikolayevka in the eastern Donetsk region. The AP witnessed burnt trucks and the corpse of a man in camouflage fatigues.

‚Äî In the seaside resort town of Berdyansk, dozens of protesters chanted angrily in the main square against Russian occupiers, yelling at them to go home and singing the Ukrainian national anthem. They described the soldiers as exhausted young conscripts.

SATELLITE IMAGERY

‚Äî Russian troops advanced slowly on Kyiv from the north. A vast convoy of armored vehicles, tanks, artillery and support vehicles was 17 miles (25 kilometers) from the center of the city and stretched for 40 miles, according to satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies.

‚Äî The latest Maxar photos also showed deployments of ground forces and ground attack helicopter units in southern Belarus.

ANNOUNCED BY RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES

‚Äî The Russian military has offered to allow residents to leave Kyiv via a safe corridor, raising fears a further onslaught is coming.

‚Äî For the second day in a row, the Kremlin raised the specter of nuclear war, announcing that its nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarines and long-range bombers had all been put on high alert, following President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs orders over the weekend.

ANNOUNCED BY UKRAINIAN AUTHORITIES

‚Äî More than 70 Ukrainian soldiers were killed in an attack on a military base in Okhtyrka, a city between Kharkiv and Kyiv, the head of the region wrote on Telegram. Dmytro Zhyvytskyy posted photographs of the charred shell of a four-story building and rescuers searching the rubble. He said they were still recovering some bodies. In a later Facebook post, he said many Russian soldiers and some local residents also were killed during the fighting.

‚Äî Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said at least 16 children have been killed and 45 wounded, among hundreds of casualties. The U.N. human rights chief said 102 civilians have been killed and hundreds wounded ‚Äî warning that figure was likely a vast undercount.

‚Äî Ukraine's Emergency Ministry released a video showing damaged buildings and destruction in the northern city of Chernihiv. The ministry claims shelling hit a residential building, a building at the central market and a kindergarten.

‚Äî Zelenskyy said Mariupol, a port city on the Sea of Azov, is ‚Äúhanging on.‚Äù

ANNOUNCED BY OFFICIALS ELSEWHERE

‚Äî The U.N. refugee agency said more than 520,000 refugees had fled Ukraine and that the number ‚Äúhas been rising exponentially, hour after hour.‚Äù The U.N. expects the total to reach 4 million in the coming weeks.
