Street fighting and bombardments have raged in the besieged city of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov. Hundreds of thousands are believed to be trapped inside buildings, with no access to food, water, power or heat.

Millions of people have fled Ukraine since Russian forces entered on Feb. 24 in what Moscow called a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour's military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists.

Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw its forces.

Maurer, who visited Ukraine last week, said he would raise the issues of prisoners of war, missing people and detained civilians in his talks in Moscow.

He also met Pavel Savchuk, President of the Russian Red Cross, and Mrs Moskalkova, Human Rights Commissioner.



My conversations with Russian authorities are part of an existing and sustained bilateral dialogue between the ICRC and Russia on humanitarian needs and international humanitarian law. Last week I was in Kyiv and this week I was in Moscow; I have also visited the Donbas area several times. We speak to all sides with the same goal: saving lives and reducing suffering during armed conflict,"" said Mr Maurer. ""In the face of enormous needs, ICRC is rapidly expanding our humanitarian assistance to all those affected by the armed conflict in Ukraine.

The meetings focused on the armed conflict in Ukraine but also included humanitarian issues in Syria. On Ukraine, discussions focused on pressing humanitarian concerns, including:



Safe passages: Mr Maurer stressed that the parties must facilitate movements of civilians out of cities where fighting is taking place, and also the need to allow humanitarian supplies in. The ICRC urges the parties to agree on more safe passages and specific details to make them happen - such as starting time, duration, location - to allow civilians to escape the fighting.



Protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure: The ICRC is concerned about the suffering inflicted on civilians when they are exposed to devastating levels of violence. Wherever they may be, civilians and those no longer directly participating in the hostilities remain protected by international humanitarian law. All civilian objects and infrastructure must be spared from attack, including hospitals, schools, water systems and electrical infrastructure. The principles of proportionality, distinction, and precaution must be followed and put into practice in military operations to limit civilian suffering.



Prisoners of war, civilian internees, and the missing: ICRC's right to visit prisoners of war and civilian internees is an essential part of the parties' obligations to protect civilians and those no longer fighting. The repatriation and dignified treatment of the dead on all sides of the armed conflict is vital, as is the need for families to know the fate and whereabouts of their loved ones. All sides of the armed conflict are bound to facilitate and benefit from this key humanitarian activity.



ICRC's assistance scale-up: ICRC has brought in over 300 tons of aid in recent weeks and trucks are transporting medical supplies and relief, for example war-wounded kits to hospitals in Odessa and hygiene and relief items to displaced people in Vinnytsia and Dnipro. In Lysychansk and Severodonetsk, 2.5 tons of food and hygiene items were donated to local shelters. In the Donbas area, the ICRC has supported access to water for over 1 million people and supported over 140 medical facilities since 2014. Last week in Donetsk the ICRC distributed materials to help repair five health centers and damaged homes.

“We certainly also discussed the international humanitarian law and provisions of the Geneva Conventions in regard to conduct of hostilities… that civilians must be protected,” Peter Maurer said at a joint press conference with Lavrov.

Maurer was visiting Moscow after spending five days in Ukraine last week.

He said he and Lavrov had a “very substantive discussion”, and that he would also raise the Geneva Conventions that must be respected during a conflict at a meeting with the Russian defence ministry.

These conventions concern prisoners of war and “civilians detained in Russia as well as in Ukraine”, he said, as well as “the issue of dead bodies — civilians and militaries — that need to be repatriated and brought back to the families”.

The Russian minister said “we hope the efforts of the ICRC will bear fruit”, calling it an “impartial and independent intermediary”.

“Unfortunately we don’t have any particular basis to rely on conscientious fulfilment by the Kyiv authorities,” he added.

Maurer said the ICRC was committed to enlarging its humanitarian assistance to all citizens affected by the conflict, both in territory controlled by the Ukrainian government and in areas under Russian-backed separatist control.

“We have a particularly challenging frontline at the present moment in Ukraine in the sense that populations are exposed to military operations in urban areas, they are trapped in between frontlines,” Maurer said.

Talks between Ukraine and Russia “have produced already certain positive developments in terms of agreements for civilian populations, but we also know that this is insufficient”, he said.

Questioned on the humanitarian situation in the besieged southeastern port of Mariupol, he said that the city “has high visibility and attention from the international community”.

“But I also wanted to highlight that it is not the only place of concern,” Maurer said.

“It’s not possible to think about access or evacuation in Mariupol or any other place if we don’t have solid agreement and detailed agreement between the militaries on the ground,” he said.

Maurer told AFP ahead of his trip to Russia that he hoped to make progress on issues regarding “prisoners of war, the deceased, the conduct of hostilities”.

Roman Rukomeda is a Ukrainian political analyst. This is his 25th account of Russia’s invasion into Ukraine, which he succeeded to send to EURACTIV despite hardships and limited internet access.

The 30th day of war is coming to an end. The Russian aggressors do not have any significant successes so far. They have been pushed back around Kyiv. They did not manage to proceed towards Mykolayiv and Odesa, where they were counter-attacked, so they retreated towards the Kherson region.

They did not manage to capture Chernihiv, Sumy or even Mariupol despite the massive destruction inflicted on these cities. They continue to lose people, tanks, armoured vehicles, planes and helicopters in big numbers.

At the same time Ukraine has mobilised military reserves and now has about half a million soldiers and officers that are ready to fight and know how to do it. The only problem is weapons.

Meanwhile, Ukraine is experiencing a real humanitarian catastrophe in areas captured by Russian aggressors. People that are staying in their houses are lacking drinking water, food, electricity, heating and security.

Russian invaders are plundering, looting and robbing, killing and torturing civilians. In Mariupol drama theatre, which served as the biggest shelter and later was attacked by the Russian superheavy aviation bomb, there are more than 300 dead people under ruins. Some of them are pregnant women or women with newborn babies from the previously bombed maternity house of the city.

One of the biggest problems is Russia’s kidnapping of Ukrainian citizens, deporting them with force to Russian territory.

Ukrainian authorities in besieged Mariupol said about 15,000 civilians had been illegally deported to Russia since Russian terrorists seized parts of the southern port city.

There is evidence of strange behaviour by the International Committee of the Red Cross and its head, who announced the decision to open an office in Russian Rostov to assist Russian terrorists in the illegal deportation of Ukrainian citizens. In comparison, the president of the Red Cross did not mention such steps when he was in Ukraine.

Moreover, Red Cross is keeping silent about Russian filtration camps for captured Ukrainian citizens and is denying access of Red Cross members to Ukrainian war prisoners.

It looks bizarre and unacceptable in the current situation as the Red Cross has taken the Russian side despite the war crimes these terrorists commit each day in Ukraine. Hopefully, there will be a reasonable explanation for such behaviour.

The national economy has got used to operating in wartime mode. Now people in state and private enterprises can work up to 60 hours per week with just one day off. In the current situation, personal property such as cars can also be taken by the state with further financial compensation.

It is necessary to understand that now Ukraine is creating a new European history where Russia will no longer be a threat to any European state and will not have a possibility to intrude in the internal affairs and policies of sovereign European countries. It is also the most appropriate time now for the beginning of creating a new European security system with its influence on the global dimension. Ukraine is helping Europe and the world isolate and punish the most dangerous terrorist state of the 21st century – Russia.

The price Ukraine is paying is enormous, and the glory of its heroes is eternal.",https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/opinion/the-international-red-cross-is-siding-with-russia/
