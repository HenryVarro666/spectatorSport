European Union officials have discussed using billions of blocked assets of several Russian oligarchs, including superyachts, jets and real estate, to help fund Ukraine's recovery in light of its military conflict with Russia, the report said.",https://www.urdupoint.com/en/world/us-allies-in-europe-may-use-seized-assets-of-1485089.html
1,832cd6e2-2c3b-49a2-ac1b-94f7195efd90,"['Alberto Nardelli', 'Stephanie Bodoni']",2022-03-18 17:03:35-04:00,"(Bloomberg) -- European Union officials are discussing the possibility of using the assets of sanctioned Russian tycoons to help fund Ukraine’s war recovery efforts, according to three people familiar with the matter.

The idea is at a very early stage and no decision has been taken, the people said. One possibility would be to use the assets to fund war reparations, the people added. Any decision over how to handle the assets would ultimately need to be made by member states.

“At this point the assets are only frozen,” said Eric Mamer, spokesman for European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, when asked for comment. “The president has not asked for this to be explored.”

Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last month, the EU has sanctioned dozens of Russian tycoons, including some of the country’s wealthiest billionaires. Following the adoption of the penalties, several member states have immobilized assets such as superyachts, private jets and properties. Italy alone has frozen about 780 million euros ($862 million) worth of assets, government releases show.

The current sanctions regime allows for assets to be frozen and the EU announced on Thursday it was creating a “Freeze and Seize” task force to share information among member states in order to better implement the measures.

According to a statement released by the bloc’s executive arm to announce the initiative, the task force “aims to go one step further: It will coordinate actions by member states to seize and, where the national law calls for it, confiscate assets of the listed Russian and Belarusian oligarchs.”

In addition to the European task force, the EU will also work with Group of Seven countries, including the U.S., and Australia, on REPO -- the “Russian Elites, Proxies and Oligarchs” task force -- to coordinate efforts to identify the assets of those individuals and entities sanctioned in connection with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and take “legal steps to find, restrain, freeze, seize, and, where appropriate, confiscate or forfeit” their assets, according to the press release.

The discussion comes amid growing concern about Ukraine’s ability to sustain its military operations and provide services to its citizens, particularly since its ability to issue bonds on the international market is significantly limited.

Separately, European Council President Charles Michel announced on Friday that he spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy about the possibility of creating a Ukraine Solidarity Fund. Such a mechanism would provide short-term liquidity for the country’s defense efforts and basic services, as well as to pay for longer term investments to reconstruct the economy, another official said. Michel said partners could contribute through an international donors conference.

The US Government has announced potential $5million payouts to Americans offering information leading to seizure of assets belonging to Russian oligarchs.

The rewards, announced Wednesday by the Treasury Department, come as part of a sprawling effort by US officials to sanction individuals in league with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin amid the country's invasion of Ukraine.

Sanctions administered in the wake of the war by the US and several other Western nations have seen countries across Europe confiscate Russian business leaders' yachts, mansions and private jets the past month.

The new guidance, however, dubbed the 'Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Rewards Program,' was established months before the conflict, approved by Congress during the Trump administration as part of a defense spending plan.

With that said, the plan was officially only launched this week, as authorities continue to hunt for millions in assets squirrelled away by Russia's super-rich elites.

Under the new program, any US citizen who relays information that leads to the restrain, seizure, or forfeiture of assets 'linked to corruption involving the government of the Russian Federation,' could claim the $5millon, Treasury officials said Wednesday.

Assets can include yachts, jets, and properties owned by the rich Russians, only if they are situated in the US.

They can also include any financial holdings under the name of the oligarchs, if they are deemed by the US government to be aiding the Russian cause as the conflict continues.

Hundreds of Russian oligarchs, organizations, and individuals are set to and have already been hit with sanctions from Western countries targeting 'dirty money' and assets tied to the war

The US Treasury Department, headed by Janet Yellen (pictured here in September 2021), the Treasury Department, announced Wednesday a bill that will see potential $5million payouts to Americans offering information leading to seizure of assets belonging to Russian oligarchs

The Treasury can also award more than $5million, Vice reported, if they feel the situation warrants a more substantial payout.

A Treasury Department committee will consider 'reward eligibility on a case-by-case basis,' which will then need to be ultimately approved by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.

New York trial attorney Joe Valenti told USA Today Saturday that the program shows that the US government is willing to 'use all the tools that they can and put a lot of teeth into the economic sanctions.'

According to Valenti, who looked over the Congress-approved program, assets could include almost anything of value, as long as it belongs to a Putin ally - whether it be real estate, jewelry, investments, or even art.

Hundreds of Russian oligarchs, organizations, and individuals are set to and have already been hit with sanctions from Western countries targeting 'dirty money' allegedly being used to fund the war.

Under the program, any US citizen who relays information that leads to the restrain, seizure, or forfeiture of assets 'linked to corruption involving the government of the Russian Federation' could claim the $5millon. This $440million vessel, the SY A, owned by Russian billionaire Audrey Melnichenko, was seized by Italian authorities in the port of Trieste last Friday

On Monday, authorities in Spain seized former KB officer Sergei Chemezov's Valerie, a 279-foot, $140million superyacht that had been moored in Barcelona.

Oligarchs such as Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, valued by Forbes at $13.7billion, have seen their assets targeted in recent weeks, due to suspected links to the Kremlin.

The under-fire Premiere League fixture's $560million superyacht, The Solaris, was 'rushed' out of a shipyard in Barcelona last week - weeks before repairs were scheduled to be finished.

It is believed that he wanted to move his yacht out of Western European waters because of the risk of it being seized, even though he had still not been sanctioned at the time by the EU.

The Solaris which has a helipad and its own missile detection system had been undergoing repairs in the port of Barcelona before suddenly being moved last week.

Staff are said to have been told to tear down scaffolding so it could make a quick getaway.

This week, DailyMail.com photographers snapped Abramovich, 55, an orphan and a college dropout turned Kremlin insider, brazenly sailing the Solaris and his other yacht, the $711million Eclipse, on the high seas.

France, meanwhile, detained the Amore Vero, a 280ft superyacht valued at $120million said to be owned by Igor Sechin, a close Putin confidant, in the Mediterranean port of La Ciotat, as part of the sweeping Western sanctions on Russia's elite

The three-masted yacht, called the Sy A is owned by Russian billionaire Andrey Melnichenko (left), head of the EuroChem Group, a major fertilizer producer, and the coal company SUEK. Meanwhile, Sechin (right), who is facing sanctions, is the chief executive of the Russian oil producer Rosneft and a known ally of Putin

The billionaire's superyacht Solaris was seen off Tivat, Montenegro, earlier this week, but amid a seizure threat it is now motoring towards Turkey.

Eclipse - the second-largest luxury yacht in the world - was last seen off Gibraltar five days ago. It is reportedly now somewhere in the Mediterranean, past Libya and Tunisia.

Both boats were pictured flying Red Ensign flags - a flag that is only granted to parities that are under British protection – despite facing sanctions from the county.

The under-fire oligarch has both his luxury yachts – together estimated to be worth nearly $1.2 billion – registered in the British overseas territory of Bermuda.

It is believed that he wanted to move his yacht out of western European waters because of the risk of it being seized, even though he had still not been sanctioned at the time by the EU.

The steel magnate also owns a $200million mansion in Kensington, a $43million West London penthouse and, private jets, helicopters and supercars, when valued along with his yachts, are worth more than $1.6billion.

A Boeing 767 previously used by Abramovich landed in Basel on Tuesday, but has not been seized. The oligarch's main jet, a $340million Boeing 787 Dreamliner, is in Dubai.

Superyachts owned by other oligarchs have been dispersed to locations across the globe, including the Maldives, Seychelles and Turkey to prevent them being seized.

As sanctions increase and safe havens reduce, Abramovich's and other oligarchs' planes and boats are heading for places where they cannot be seized

French and Italian authorities recently seized four yachts worth nearly $800million on suspicion that they were owned by figures with ties to the Kremlin.

The most expensive of the haul was a $440 million vessel called the Sy A – short for Sailing Yacht A – which was impounded by Italian authorities in the port of Trieste last Friday.

The three-masted yacht is owned by Russian billionaire Andrey Melnichenko who owns the EuroChem Group, a major fertilizer producer, and the coal company SUEK.

Seven oligarchs sanctioned by UK Roman Abramovich is one of seven Russian oligarchs sanctioned by the UK Government last week. The Government estimates his wealth at more than £9billion and notes his stakes in steel giant Evraz, Norilsk Nickel and ownership of Chelsea FC. 'He is one of the few oligarchs from the 1990s to maintain prominence under Putin,' a Government spokesman said. The other oligarchs sanctioned today are: Oleg Deripaska: Estimated wealth of £2billion and a multi-million-pound Uk property portfolio. Subject to US sanctions since 2018. Has stakes in En+ Group, a major extractives and energy company which owns UC Rusal, one of the world's major aluminum producers.

France, meanwhile, detained the Amore Vero, a 280ft superyacht valued at $120million said to be owned by Igor Sechin, a close Putin confidant, in the Mediterranean port of La Ciotat.

Sechin, who is also facing sanctions, is the chief executive of the Russian oil producer Rosneft and a known ally of Putin. Amore Vero, which means ‘true love’ in Italian, can accommodate 14 guests and 28 crew.

Italian authorities in Samremo impounded Lena, a 134ft yacht owned by Putin associate Gennady Timchenko, who has an estimated $21bn fortune held in Russian raw materials companies.

Lady M, a 209ft, $27million yacht owned by Russian billionaire Alexei Mordashov who is the main shareholder of Russia’s largest steel and mining company, was seized in the nearby Ligurian port of Imperia.

French police who boarded the vessel at night said the crew had been 'making arrangements to leave in a hurry, without having completed the planned work.'

Energy magnate Mordashov, meanwhile, still has another vessel - one much more opulent - that has so far evaded Western sanctions, the $500 million Nord.

The 464-foot vessel, which boasts two helipads and an outdoor waterfall and can accommodate 36 guests, was anchored this month in the Seychelles, where US and European Union sanctions do not apply.

Dilbar, the world’s largest superyacht by gross tonnage, which is said to be owned by former major Arsenal shareholder Alisher Usmanov, was reported to have been seized in Hamburg.

Also this week, authorities in Spain seized former KGB officer Sergei Chemezov's Valerie, a 279-foot, 140million superyacht that had been moored in Barcelona.

Chemezov, who boasts close ties to the Kremlin, heads the state conglomerate Rostec.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez touted the confiscation on La Sexta Monday.

'We are talking about a yacht that we estimate is worth $140 million,' Sanchez said.

Meanwhile, in the US, Russia's wealthiest are trying to quietly sell their properties, it has been claimed, such as in Manhattan, amid fears that they could soon face sanctions.

Russian real estate investments in the city are worth at least $1 billion, according to reports.

Some 61 properties have already gone on the market or dropped prices, according to Fox Business, and at least another 70 are considering so-called 'whisper sales' - getting rid of a property privately, without putting it on the market.

'Everybody's putting feelers out there,' said Dolly Lenz, a real estate agent.

She told Fox that her firm received calls from Russian clients looking to potentially 'whisper list' between 50 and 70 properties, mostly in Manhattan, within the last week.

'They're not pulling the trigger yet. They're getting ready to pull the trigger.

'Meaning, 'Yes, I'll take whatever the best offering can get me'.

'That could be what comes down the pike. So really, depending on sanctions, and you know where we are with everything, that's all we see potentially is playing out.'

Many of the listings were on Manhattan's 'Billionaire's Row', Fox reported.

Alexei Kuzmichev, 59, an owner of Alfa-Bank - Russia's largest private bank, which has been slapped by US sanctions — has listed his $41 million Manhattan quadruplex.

He bought the Upper East Side property, at 33 East 74th Street, in 2016 for $42 million.

Forbes estimates that the financier is worth $6.2 billon.

Another looking to sell is Valery Kogan, the billionaire owner of Moscow's Domodedevo Airport, and his wife Olga.

The pair are quietly shopping their apartment at The Plaza for $50 million, according to sources who spoke to the New York Post.

There have been 16 new listings of apartments at the Plaza, worth between one and $28milion, since the war began.

They are also selling their other Upper East Side home, at 515 Park Avenue, plus an Upper West Side residence at 15 Central Park West.

The couple also intend to sell a Greenwich, Connecticut estate, the Post reported.

As a result of the wave of Western sanctions, Russia’s currency has gone into freefall the past month, and citizens have been seen at cash machines and banks desperately trying to withdraw funds before their life-savings become worthless.

Footage has also emerged of Russian seniors fighting over scarce food on supermarket shelves, as the conflict in Ukraine enters its 24th day.

Biden administration to ground Roman Abramovich's jet amid Russia sanctions over Ukraine

By Rob Crilly

The list of 100 aircraft includes 99 Boeing airplanes operated by Russian passenger and cargo carriers including Aeroflot, AirBridge Cargo, Utair, Nordwind, Azur Air and Aviastar-TU, as well as Abramovich's $65 million Gulfstream G650, which is believed to still be in Moscow.

In a statement, the department said it meant 'international flights from Russia on these aircraft are effectively grounded.'

It is the latest blow to the 55-year-old billionaire, who made his fortune buying up discounted state assets after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

He has been hit by a string of sanctions in the U.K. and E.U. thanks to his close relationship with Putin, and scrambled to divest before the asset freeze hit.

He put Chelsea Football Club up for sale, and staff are said to have been ready for viewings at his 15-bedroom $195 million (£150m) mansion at Kensington Palace Gardens, London, and a three-storey penthouse at Chelsea Waterfront.

Flight tracking data show that the plane, with tail sign LX-RAY, flew from Istanbul, Turkey, to Moscow and the safety of Russian airspace on Tuesday

Abramovich himself is now believed to be in Moscow.

He cannot enter the U.K. or E.U.

He was spotted on Monday in the departure lounge of Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion airport - he has Russian and Israeli citizenship - and is believed to have flown from Israel to Istanbul.

The latest flight tracking data suggested his Gulfstream plane picked him up in Turkey arriving in Moscow on Tuesday.

It was one of a number of Russian planes spotted in Israel in recent days, apparently alerting U.S. authorities to its role as a bolthole for oligarchs.

At the weekend, US Undersecretary of state for political affairs Victoria Nuland warned Israel: 'You don’t want to become the last haven for dirty money that's fueling Putin's wars.'

His super yachts are also on the move - My Solaris, worth $560 million (£430m), was moored in Barcelona a week ago but is now off the coast of Algeria; Eclipse, worth $704 million (£540m) is currently in open sea off the coast of the British Virgin Islands in the Caribbean.

Along with other oligarchs, he has seen his world turned upside down since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine and the West launched an economic stranglehold on Moscow.

Abramovich's luxury lifestyle is being squeezed by EU and UK sanctions - and now the US has moved to prevent his Gulfstream plane from making international flights

Abramovich made his fortune buying up discounted state assets after the collapse of the Soviet Union and was one of the oligarchs that make up Russia's wealthy elite. The West has imposed sanctions on them in an attempt to put pressure on Vladimir Putin

U.S. lawmakers had also stepped up calls for Washington to add its weight to the pressure on Abramovich.

'We request that Abramovich be sanctioned as a matter of urgency,' wrote members of Congress.

'His blood money helps fuel Putin’s unprovoked and illegal war against Ukraine.'

It came after investigators at State Street bank in Boston claimed that more than a billion dollars of his in cash had been funneled through offshore companies into the US from 2001 to 2016, BuzzFeed News reported.

On Friday U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimando said: 'Today, the Department of Commerce is demonstrating the power and reach of the actions we took over the past few weeks in response to Russia's brutal war of choice against Ukraine.'

'We are publishing this list to put the world on notice - we will not allow Russian and Belarusian companies and oligarchs to travel with impunity in violation of our laws.”

The department published specific tail numbers of the planes, including 33 Boeing planes operated by Aeroflot , and 12 Boeing 747 cargo planes operated by AirBridge Cargo, a unit of Volga-Dnepr Group.

Aeroflot, AirBridge and a spokesperson for Abramovich, who owns the English soccer club Chelsea, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The United States, Canada and much of Europe have barred Russian planes from flying over their airspace, which has forced the cancellation of much of Russia's international flights.

The rules apply to any U.S. manufactured aircraft or any with more than 25% U.S.-origin controlled content that were re-exported to Russia after the new stringent controls on aviation-related items for Russia took effect on Feb. 24.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10630779/Snitching-Russian-oligarchs-government-lead-5-million-reward.html

The US government wants your help getting ahold of stolen assets held by Russian oligarchs — and it's willing to pay a pretty penny for it.

The Treasury Department is offering rewards of up to $5 million for information about Russian elites' yachts, mansions, private jets, and other property through an effort known as the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Rewards Program.

Through the program, rewards are given for information leading to the restraint, seizure, forfeiture, or repatriation of stolen assets in an account at a US financial institution, that enter the US, or that come into the possession or control of a US person.

The Treasury is after assets ""linked to corruption involving the government of the Russian Federation,"" the Department said on its website.

Congress last year approved the establishment of the program, which also offers rewards for information about assets linked to corruption in other foreign governments.

Besides Russia , the Treasury specifically listed requests for tips about assets linked to bribes paid by Brazilian petrochemical companies Odebrecht and Braskem, as well as corruption involving the Sovereign Wealth Fund of Malaysia, known as 1MDB.

Several nations have seized yachts, villas, and jets from sanctioned Russian oligarchs in response to the country's invasion of Ukraine . Countries like Italy, France, and Spain have detained Russian billionaires' assets in recent weeks, and President Biden said in his State of the Union earlier this month that the US will follow suit.
