The European Commission, the bloc‚Äôs executive arm, will ask member nations next week to grant temporary asylum to all Ukrainians coming to the bloc for up to three years, the bloc‚Äôs commissioner for home affairs, Ylva Johansson, told reporters on Sunday. Member nations will have to agree, but Ms. Johansson said after a meeting of interior ministers on Sunday that ‚Äúan overwhelming majority‚Äù was in favor.

Seven million Ukrainians are expected to be displaced as a consequence of the Russian invasion.

Ukrainians can stay visa-free in the European Union for up to 90 days, and they can move freely between member nations. According to the commission, many have already left the first country they arrived in and headed to countries with big Ukrainian diasporas, mainly the Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal and Spain.

So far, a limited number of Ukrainians have applied for asylum, Ms. Johansson said, with most joining their relatives who already live in the European Union. ‚ÄúBut things will change, and we need to be prepared for much higher number of people trying to come,‚Äù she added.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/27/world/europe/european-union-ukrainian-refugees-asylum.html

During her visit to Romania, Johansson told Euronews, ‚ÄúThis is really a situation where we could have millions of people on our territory, and then we need to make sure that they have the proper protection and that they have the proper rights,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúMost of Ukrainians coming now, they are coming with passports that give them visa-free entry for 90 days. But we have to prepare for day 91.‚Äù



Thank you Minister Bode @MAIRomania for the coordination at üá∫üá¶ üá∑üá¥ border.

And chance to meet and talk with those at Siret refugee camp

and border post.

To this end, Johansson said the directive would help the European Union (EU) member states to handle the applications of all Ukrainian citizens expected to enter the bloc in the coming days. She noted that the mechanism could be adopted from Thursday.



The announcement comes after the EU‚Äôs interior ministers met on Sunday to discuss the bloc‚Äôs common response to the brewing migration crisis in Ukraine. The meeting was convened by French Interior Minister G√©rald Darmanin, who said, ‚ÄúThe European Union and its member states have provided, and will continue to provide, political, financial, humanitarian and logistical support in the face of Russian aggression.‚Äù Darmanin also activated the ‚ÄòEU‚Äôs Integrated Political Crisis Response‚Äô mechanism to discuss aid allocation, monitor the situation, and coordinate solidarity efforts.

#JHA | EU home affairs ministers discussed the activation of the temporary protection system for Ukrainian refugees. They also discussed:



‚û°Ô∏èhumanitarian support

‚û°Ô∏èmanagement of external borders

‚û°Ô∏èvisa measures

‚û°Ô∏èresponse in case of hybrid threats

During the meeting, Johansson extended support to the directive, saying, ‚ÄúIn my view, I think it would be the right time to use the Temporary Protection Directive to give the proper protection to people fleeing, and also the possibility to move in the European Union.‚Äù



Commenting on the same, Sweden‚Äôs Minister for Integration, Anders Ygeman, said the directive is not a ‚Äúmagic wand‚Äù since it is voluntary. ‚ÄúI think to tackle this kind of situation we need binding rules in the EU‚Ä¶ solidarity that is bound by real decisions,‚Äù he added.



The never-used-before mechanism was adopted following the 2001 wars in Yugoslavia and Kosovo. The directive extends temporary and immediate protection to people from non-EU countries who have been forced to leave their country due to armed conflict, violation of their human rights, and endemic violence. The directive strikes a balance between member states by allocating refugees according to states‚Äô accommodation capacities.



Once the mechanism is activated, all EU member states, except Denmark and Ireland, are obligated to receive the displaced people and fulfil certain obligations, including the issuance of residence permits to those granted temporary protection, which can be extended for up to three years.



Reportedly, the activation of the ‚Äòtemporary protection directive‚Äô will be proposed during the March 3 meeting of the EU member states‚Äô interior and justice ministers.



According to the United Nations, more than 500,000 people have fled Ukraine and sought refuge in neighbouring countries such as Poland, Hungary, Moldova, Romania, and Slovakia. The Commission estimates that Russia‚Äôs military attack on Ukraine could lead to Europe‚Äôs largest humanitarian crisis and displace seven million Ukrainians.



About half a million refugees have fled Ukraine since Russia‚Äôs invasion began last week, according to the United Nations refugee agency.



About half of them crossed the western border to Poland. Others have gone to Hungary, Moldova, Romania and Slovakia.https://t.co/ktF9ultRmZ pic.twitter.com/mNzTg2PvWr ‚Äî The New York Times (@nytimes) March 1, 2022

Poland has opened its borders for all Ukrainians and removed its negative COVID-19 test requirement. Germany and Austria are also offering free train services to those trying to flee the war.



Meanwhile, the European Commission on Monday announced additional emergency aid worth $100 million to aid civilians affected by the war in Ukraine. According to the official press release, the funding will help people in Ukraine and Moldova, and provide them with food, water, shelter, and health. Furthermore, the Commission said it is coordinating the transportation of material aid, including essential medical supplies, via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism to Ukraine.",https://www.statecraft.co.in/article/eu-activates-temporary-protection-directive-to-aid-over-500-000-ukrainians-fleeing-war

These soldiers have deliberately punched holes in their vehicles, just to avoid the combat, the NYT report said.

The assessment is presumably based on the statements given by captured Russian soldiers and is the reason why the 40-mile convoy of tanks and armoire vehicles near Kyiv has come to a near crawl in the past few days, the report added.

But, the Pentagon official cited by NYT, said that Russian commanders leading the armoured column may be rethinking their battle plans to push forward, and encircle and capture the Ukrainian capital.

The Ukraine ‚Äì Russian talks have now ended for today ‚Äì the outcome is as yet unknown. A second round of talks is planned, but no date has yet been set.

Al Jazeera‚Äôs Bernard Smith, reporting from Moscow this afternoon, says Ukraine and Russia ‚Äúseem very, very far apart on what they want out of the talks‚Äù. ‚ÄúRussia, we already know, has asked for an unconditional surrender of the Ukrainian forces,‚Äù Smith said. (Al Jazeer)

INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION

The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, signed the application for membership of the European Union, it was announced this Monday on the official account of the Ukrainian Parliament via Twitter. The announcement comes after the Ukrainian president asked this Monday for the country‚Äôs immediate accession to the EU under a simplified procedure, reported this Monday Politico (open access / content in English).

‚ÄúWe ask the European Union for the immediate accession of Ukraine through a new special procedure,‚Äù Zelensky said via Telegram. ‚ÄúOur aim is to be with all Europeans and, more importantly, to be on an equal footing. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs fair. I am sure it is possible,‚Äù he added.

Earlier a top EU official said Monday there were disagreements among the 27 member states on enlarging the bloc, as Kyiv appealed for membership in the face of a Russian invasion. ‚ÄúThere are different opinions and sensitivities within the EU on enlargement,‚Äù European Council chief Charles Michel said. He said that Kyiv would have to submit an official request to join, then member states would have to come up with a unanimous position. (AFP)

HUMMANITARIAN AID

More than 500,000 people have fled Ukraine since the start of Russia‚Äôs invasion, Filippo Grandi, the UN‚Äôs high commissioner for refugees, says. The latest and still growing count had 281,000 people entering Poland, more than 84,500 in Hungary, about 36,400 in Moldova, more than 32,500 in Romania and about 30,000 in Slovakia, UN refugee agency (UNHCR) spokeswoman Shabia Mantoo said.

Ukraine‚Äôs president says Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has agreed to provide Kyiv with $100m of aid, on top of existing financial support.

Pakistan‚Äôs foreign ministry says it has evacuated at least 499 of the country‚Äôs citizens from Ukraine in recent days. The ministry said in a statement that a further 160 citizens were awaiting evacuation at the Ukraine-Poland border, and an additional 21 were currently en route to the Ukraine-Hungary border.

The European Union is preparing to grant Ukrainians who flee the war the right to stay and work in the 27-nation bloc for up to three years, senior EU and French officials said, thanking volunteers at the borders for helping those who arrive.(AFP)

Home rental company Airbnb Inc said today its non-profit arm Airbnb.org would offer free, temporary housing for up to 100,000 refugees fleeing Ukraine. Chief Executive Brian Officer Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia, the chairman of Airbnb.org, have sent letters to leaders of Poland, Romania, Germany and Hungary offering help to house the refugees

OPPOSITION

More than a thousand writers and artists from all over the world, including some Nobels, such as the Turkish Orhan Pamuk and the Belarusian Svetlana Alexievich, signed a letter condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine, announced PEN International.

Margaret Atwood, Paul Auster, Jonathan Franzen, Maria Ressa ‚Äì journalist who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2021 ‚Äì Salman Rushdie, Olga Tokarczuk, Benjamin Moser, Joyce Carol Oates and Siri Hustvedt are other personalities who signed the PEN International document, chaired since September 2021 by Turkish writer Burhan Sonmez.

AIR TRAVEL

Russia this Monday banned airspace to airlines from 36 countries, including Portugal, in response to sanctions imposed by several countries, advances Russian news agency RIA Novosti.

Russian Foreign Minster Sergei Lavrov has cancelled a trip to Geneva for disarmament talks because his plane would not be able to pass through airspace that the European Union has closed to Russian aviation as part of sanctions against Moscow, RIA news agency quoted a diplomatic source as saying on Monday. (Reuters)

SHIPPING

The United Kingdom on Monday banned Russian-flagged ships from docking in its ports. The ban extends to ships registered in Russia or owned by Russian citizens.

‚ÄúThe maritime sector is fundamental to international trade and we must do our part to constrain economic interests‚Äù, said Secretary of State for Transport, Grant Shapps, in a letter addressed to British citizens.

ELECTRICITY DISRUPTION

About 322,000 Ukrainian citizens are experiencing disruptions (partial or complete) in access to electricity, the Ukrainian Ministry of Energy advances through Facebook.

In the publication, the Ministry guarantees that the authorities are working to restore the normality of services.

HACKING ATTACKS

The website of Russian state news agency TASS appears to have been hacked, the Reuters news agency reports, with its regular site replaced with an anti-war message and calls to stop Putin‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine.

‚ÄúWe urge you to stop this madness, do not send your sons and husbands to certain death,‚Äù the message read, Reuters reported, citing checks from several different devices.

RUSSIAN ECONOMY

The sanctions imposed by the European Union on Russia are causing economic turmoil. The ruble, the Russian currency, has never been worth less and there is already a run on ATMs. In Moscow, the stock exchange did not open this Monday. All trading on the markets is suspended until further notice. The ruble plummeted after the announcement of new economic sanctions on Vladimir Putin. A ruble is worth less than a cent. To get an idea, to buy something that cost just one euro, you would need 110 rubles.

INTERNATIONAL SPORTS

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) says its executive board has recommended that international sports federations ban Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials from participating in events. The board said in a statement that in cases where it proves impossible to prevent athletes from the two countries competing, such as if there is insufficient time to give notice or for other ‚Äúorganisational or legal reasons‚Äù, they should be prevented from doing so under their nations‚Äô banner.

Russia has been expelled from the 2022 World Cup and its teams suspended from all international football competitions ‚Äúuntil further notice‚Äù after its invasion of Ukraine, FIFA announced in a joint statement with UEFA on Monday. The men‚Äôs team had been due to play in qualifying play-offs in March for the World Cup in Qatar later this year, while its women‚Äôs side had qualified for the European Championship in England, to be held in July.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) recommends that Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials are banned from any organised international competitions.

The IOC has urged sport governing bodies not to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete, with the Beijing Winter Paralympic Games starting on Friday. (BBC)

TRANSPORT

The trains are free and everyone can enter up to the maximum limit. Even so, several families were being separated as only children and women could pass. The capital‚Äôs central train station is completely packed. This comes after the Russian Defence Ministry said civilians can safely leave Kyiv.

SANCTIONS

Switzerland, a traditionally neutral country, will adopt all European Union sanctions against Russia, ‚Äúwithout any exception‚Äù, the government announced on Monday, after the president had given this possibility as ‚Äúvery likely‚Äù.

Ignazio Cassis admitted that this is an ‚Äúunprecedented and difficult step‚Äù that needed ‚Äúcareful consideration‚Äù.

Finance Minister Ueli Maurer added that ‚Äúthere will not be a single exception‚Äù to European sanctions and that ‚Äúit is essential‚Äù to maintain the integrity of the Swiss financial centre.

NETFIX AND SPOTIFY

Some Netflix and Spotify members in Russia say they are having trouble paying their subscription fees.

As SkyNews reports, some service users say they are receiving error messages related to their bank cards, especially from banks such as Sberbank, Tinkoff and Alfa-Bank.

It is possible that these difficulties are related to the exclusion of these banks from the SWIFT financial system but, for the moment, none of the companies has commented on the situation.

RUSSIAN BANKING

All Russian banks will have their assets frozen within days, UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Monday, as part of plans to ramp up economic sanctions. ‚ÄúWe will bring in a full asset freeze on all Russian banks in days, looking to coordinate with our allies,‚Äù Truss told parliament, saying it was designed to prevent the Kremlin funding its invasion of Ukraine.

Putin will pay ‚Äòover the long run‚Äô for Ukraine invasion, Biden says in State of the Union address

U.S. President Joe Biden said Russian leader Vladimir Putin must be harshly punished for the invasion of Ukraine to stop other authoritarians from emulating his attack on the democratic world, framing the war as an existential fight against autocracy.

‚ÄúThroughout our history, we‚Äôve learned this lesson: when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos. They keep moving, and the costs and threats to America and to the world keep rising.‚Äù

Mr. Biden emphasized the unity of the Western alliance in imposing unprecedented sanctions on Moscow, vowing that Mr. Putin would come out of the struggle far worse off. He also announced further measures, including that the U.S. would join the European Union and Canada in closing its airspace to Russian planes, and seize luxury yachts belonging to oligarchs.

He ruled out sending U.S. forces to Ukraine, an acknowledgment both of Americans‚Äô refusal to get into another war after debacles in Iraq and Afghanistan, and of the risks of escalation. Mr. Putin has already threatened to use his nuclear arsenal in response to Western sanctions.

Analysis: In first State of the Union address, Biden captures the moment telling Putin ‚Äòfreedom will always triumph over tyranny‚Äô

The annual State of the Union Address is an American set-piece, a sturdy tradition required by the Constitution, and beginning with the 20th century, 87 of these messages have been delivered in person and most of them have concentrated on domestic affairs.

Not this one.

Not in a Capitol sealed off by a fence. Not in a capital warily watching the Russian invasion of Ukraine and shuddering as Vladimir Putin has his nuclear forces on alert.

‚ÄúThe world is clearly choosing the side of peace and security,‚Äù Joe Biden said, telling Ukrainians, represented in the hall by Oksana Markarova, Kyiv‚Äôs ambassador to Washington, ‚ÄúWe stand with you.‚Äù

The principal elements of the speech were addressed as much to Mr. Putin as to the audience in the chamber and at home across the country.

‚ÄúThe free world is holding him accountable,‚Äù Mr. Biden said, adding that the Russian president was ‚Äúmore isolated from the world than he has ever been.‚Äù

Asian shares slip, oil surges again as Russia sanctions bite

Asian stocks came under renewed pressure and oil prices jumped after rising worries about the impact of aggressive sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine sank shares in Europe and on Wall Street.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes closed about 1.6% lower, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped nearly 1.8%.

Global sanctions against Russia have prompted a string of major companies to announce suspensions to or exits from their businesses in the country.

Exxon Mobil said on Tuesday that it will exit Russia operations, including oil production fields, following similar decisions by British oil giants BP PLC and Shell, and Norway‚Äôs Equinor ASA.

Exxon‚Äôs announcement comes as the price of oil continues to surge above $100 per barrel. On Wednesday morning, global benchmark Brent crude jumped 2.6% to $107.69 per barrel, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 3% o $106.50.

Alberta investment agency to sell off Russian assets

Alberta‚Äôs public-investment manager Alberta Investment Management Corp., or AIMCo, says it has started divesting all of its small measure of Russian holdings in response to the invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing humanitarian crisis.

The public-investment manager holds more than $160-billion in assets for provincial pension plans and endowments and said in a news release that the decision is ‚Äúboth values, and value-driven‚Äù and reflects the change in geopolitical risk.

At the end of last week, AIMCo‚Äôs exposure was about $159-million, or roughly 0.1 per cent of its total assets, according to the fund manager‚Äôs spokesperson D√©nes N√©meth. But by this week, that number had dropped.

AIMCo‚Äôs news release also said the Russian holdings now represent 0.16 per cent of the entire $48.7-billion public-equities portfolio and areexternally managed. ‚ÄúBeyond public equities, AIMCo does not have any direct exposure to Russia.‚Äù

Former Afghan translator flees Ukraine to safety

From inside a Polish school near the border with Ukraine that‚Äôs been converted to a shelter for refugees, Jawed Haqmal says he can‚Äôt believe what his family experienced over the past five days in Kyiv and he‚Äôs feeling incredibly relieved to have made it to safety.

‚ÄúFinally I escaped that country, this is the second war. I hope there will not be a third,‚Äù Mr. Haqmal told The Globe and Mail on Tuesday evening after the nearly 20-hour trip. Mr. Haqmal and his family had fled war in Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover last summer, only to find themselves fleeing Russia‚Äôs war in Ukraine.

Mr. Haqmal worked as an interpreter for the Canadian military in Afghanistan and had been living in a Kyiv hotel with his family since the end of August. His family of 12 were evacuated by Ukrainian special forces, a mission carried out after a request from The Globe to the office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Their stay in Ukraine was meant to be temporary but ended up feeling at times indefinite as they waited, and still wait, for resettlement approval from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, or IRCC.

For Moldova, welcoming Ukrainians combines kindness with economic self-interest

For three decades, one of Europe‚Äôs poorest countries has been emptying out: More than a million people have departed Moldova since 1991. They‚Äôre still leaving, at a pace of 35,000 a year. Across the country, 100,000 homes stand empty.

Now, Ukrainian refugees are pouring into Moldova ‚Äì more than 88,000 so far ‚Äì and its government and companies are scrambling to give them chances to work through acts of charity that coincide with a national need for labour.

The government is sweeping away legal barriers to their employment and opening its classrooms to Ukrainian teachers. Meanwhile, companies are offering jobs as graphic designers, office managers, construction workers, restaurant staff and IT workers.

But the tide of people also represents an economic opportunity to bring skills into a country that has struggled to keep its most talented at home.

No-fly zone over Ukraine out of the question for NATO

NATO countries are not considering imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said despite a plea from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that it would limit the number of people who die.

Mr. Johnson ruled out a no-fly zone while speaking at a news conference at Estonia‚Äôs Tapa military base on Tuesday, where British troops are leading the NATO battle group stationed there. The news came as Russian military aggression is expected to increase and after reports that Russia is indiscriminately bombing civilian areas.

‚ÄúWhen it comes to a no fly-zone ‚Ä¶ in the skies above Ukraine, we have to accept the reality that, that involves shooting down Russian planes,‚Äù Mr. Johnson said. ‚ÄúThat is a very, very big step that is simply not on the agenda of any NATO country.‚Äù

World Court to hear Ukraine and Russia case on March 7-8

The World Court on Tuesday said it will hold hearings on March 7-8 on whether to order ‚Äúprovisional measures‚Äù in a lawsuit brought by Ukraine against Russia seeking a halt to Moscow‚Äôs military actions in Ukraine.

The UN court said in a statement it had sent Russia an urgent communication to prepare in case it does order provisional measures, or immediate steps, to protect Ukraine, as it has requested.

The court, formally known as the International Court of Justice, is the United Nations‚Äô venue for resolving disputes between states.

Ukraine‚Äôs lawsuit filed on Sunday argues that Russia‚Äôs claim it invaded Ukraine to prevent a genocide is false.

Ukraine‚Äôs President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Sunday that he had filed the lawsuit at the court over genocide accusations made by Moscow.

Russian President Vladimir Putin had repeatedly asserted that Ukraine committed ‚Äúgenocide‚Äù in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine, without presenting evidence, and said the invasion, called a ‚Äúspecial operation‚Äù by Russian officials, was therefore justified to end it.

Beijing offers to play role in ending attack on Ukraine amid international criticism for appearing to stand by Russia

Chinese foreign ministry Wang Yi spoke with his Ukrainian counterpart Tuesday, offering to play a role in ending the conflict as Beijing faces international criticism for appearing to stand by Russia following the invasion.

Ukraine said foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba had pushed Mr. Wang to pressure Russia to stop the war. The Chinese readout said Kiev ‚Äúis willing to strengthen communication with China and looks forward to China‚Äôs mediation to achieve a ceasefire.‚Äù

Beijing previously called for a diplomatic end to the conflict but stopped short of criticizing Moscow, with foreign ministry officials even unwilling to call the operation launched by Russia an ‚Äúinvasion.‚Äù This, as well as a show of unity by President Xi Jinping and Russian leader Vladimir Putin in early February, had been seen by many as proof the war had China‚Äôs tacit approval.

Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder loses entire staff after refusing to resign from Russian energy company boards

The entire staff of Gerhard Schroeder, the former German chancellor who is close to Russian President Vladimir Putin and an advocate of increasing Russian natural gas exports to Germany, has resigned in protest over his ties to the Kremlin.

The employees quit because they were embarrassed by Mr. Schroeder‚Äôs prominent roles at three Russian gas and pipeline companies, according to German media reports.

Those roles had enraged many Germans even before Mr. Putin invaded Ukraine last week. Some of his critics noted that Mr. Schroeder‚Äôs income ultimately came from a regime ‚Äì the Russian government ‚Äì that had launched an illegal and senseless war, in their view.

For Ukrainian refugees in Poland, hope lives at the humble Marko Hotel

At any other time, the Hotel Marko would barely rate a glimpse from travellers as they sped along the highway outside Przemysl, which leads to Poland‚Äôs border with Ukraine.

The two-storey hotel is easy to miss despite its bright yellow walls and turret motif. It sits behind an empty furniture store and a deserted restaurant, both closed because of the pandemic.

The Marko‚Äôs 15 rooms ‚Äì painted either green or white ‚Äì offer few amenities for its three-star rating beyond a table, a couple of chairs, a television and a kettle.

There‚Äôs a broken fridge in the lobby selling warm soft drinks, and a rack of postcards featuring pictures of local attractions.

‚ÄúI think we will probably see that in the coming days and weeks as Putin tries to lash out against these crippling level of sanctions we‚Äôve put on him,‚Äù Warner said while appearing on a Washington Post live event.

The White House and the European Union have unleashed unprecedented economic sanctions in recent days that have strangled the Russian economy, sending the value of the ruble plummeting.

Warner has also raised the possibility that cyber-attacks launched by Putin could trigger NATO‚Äôs Article 5 collective defense principle, which says an attack on one NATO country is an attack on all, as well as warning of a dangerous cyber tit-for-tat between global powers.

‚ÄúThese can be extraordinarily destructive and if you get into the cyber escalation, you don‚Äôt know where it would end,‚Äù he said Monday.

The European Space Agency said Monday that the launch of a mission to Mars with Russia later this year is ‚Äúvery unlikely‚Äù after Moscow‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine.

‚ÄúWe are fully implementing sanctions imposed on Russia by our Member States,‚Äù the agency said in a statement.

Senior defense official: No sign yet of Belarusian forces fighting in Ukraine

12:50 p.m.

U.S. officials have not seen Belarusian troops involved in or preparing to join the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a senior U.S. defense official said Monday.

‚ÄúWe have seen no indications that Belarusian troops are being readied to move into Ukraine and certainly no indications that they are in fact moving or are in Ukraine,‚Äù the official told reporters. ‚ÄúOur best information is that the forces inside Ukraine are all Russians.‚Äù

Reports emerged earlier Monday that Belarus is preparing to send troops into Ukraine in support of the Russian invasion which began last week.

Russian President Vladimir Putin so far has sent into Ukraine ‚Äújust under 75 percent‚Äù of the more than 150,000 troops he had assembled for the assault, and forces have fired more than 380 missiles, the official said.

The Kremlin has already used Belarus as a location from which to pour its troops quickly across the border into Ukraine after insisting the large number of forces assembled there were for joint military drills.

The U.S. has also ‚Äúseen some indications‚Äù that Russia in some areas of Ukraine is employing mercenaries from the shadowy Russian military contractor the Wagner Group, though details on where or how many are not clear.

The official also said Russian forces are frustrated they have not yet taken the capitol city of Kyiv, which could lead them to take a ‚Äúmore aggressive approach‚Äù militarily.

‚ÄúThey have been slowed and they have been frustrated by their lack of progress on Kyiv,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúOne of the things that that could result in is a reevaluation of their tactics and the potential for them to be more aggressive and more overt, in both the size and scale of their targeting of Kyiv.‚Äù

The Russians are ‚Äúrunning out of gas and they‚Äôre having logistics problems‚Äù on the way south to Kyiv and have also met significant Ukrainian resistance.

Still, the Kremlin forces are roughly 16 miles away from the capital city, which they hope to encircle, according to the official.

‚ÄúWe do believe that their plans are to encircle the city and they try to take it that way because that has really been where the heaviest fighting has been,‚Äù they said.

MOSCOW (AP) ‚Äî Ordinary Russians faced the prospect of higher prices and crimped foreign travel as Western sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine sent the ruble plummeting, leading uneasy people to line up at banks and ATMs on Monday in a country that has seen more than one currency disaster in the post-Soviet era.

The Russian currency plunged about 30 percent against the U.S. dollar Monday after Western nations announced moves to block some Russian banks from the SWIFT international payment system and to restrict Russia‚Äôs use of its massive foreign currency reserves. The exchange rate later recovered ground after swift action by Russia‚Äôs central bank.

People wary that sanctions would deal a crippling blow to the economy have been flocking to banks and ATMs for days, with reports in social media of long lines and machines running out.

6:48 a.m.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) ‚Äî Outgunned but determined Ukrainian troops slowed Russia‚Äôs advance and held onto the capital and other key cities ‚Äî at least for now. In the face of stiff resistance and devastating sanctions, President Vladimir Putin ordered Russia‚Äôs nuclear forces put on high alert, threatening to elevate the war to a terrifying new level.

The bloc‚Äôs home affairs commissioner, Silva Johansson, told reporters that the European Commission will ask member states, next week, to grant temporary asylum to all Ukrainians coming to the bloc for up to three years.

Ukrainians arrived at the Medica pedestrian crossing, fleeing the fighting in their country, in eastern Poland on February 27, 2022.

The member states ‚Äôapproval would have to be approved, but Johansson said after a meeting of interior ministers that a‚Äú overwhelming majority ‚Äùsupported the decision.

It is expected that seven million Ukrainians will be displaced as a result of the Russian invasion.

In a tweet, Johansson said, ‚ÄúWe welcome open hands to those who chose to flee from Putin‚Äôs bombs.‚Äù

The committee noted that many had left the first country they had reached and headed to countries with large Ukrainian communities, mainly the Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal and Spain.

So far, Johansson said, a small number of Ukrainians have applied for asylum, most of them joined by relatives already living in the European Union.

The New York Times reported that Ukrainians have gained widespread solidarity in Poland, where dozens of people are hosting them in their homes, taking them to the border and giving them food and clothing.

Poland has prepared a train to transport the wounded Ukrainians from the city of Moscieska to the Polish capital Warsaw, where they will be sent to various hospitals.

Ukrainian refugees on the border with Poland

Poland, already home to millions of Ukrainians, is the main destination of people fleeing Russian aggression.

Polish authorities say that so far, 213,000 Ukrainians have crossed the country, and Poland has opened its border with Ukraine to everyone, regardless of their legal status.

Slovakia has announced that all Ukrainians coming to the country will receive temporary residence, free health care and work permits.

The government of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban issued a special decree last week providing temporary protection to all Ukrainians.
