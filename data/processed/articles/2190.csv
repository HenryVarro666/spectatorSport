Several international airlines continue to operate flights to and from Russia, despite the country’s invasion of Ukraine.

Air Serbia, the national carrier based in Belgrade, is believed to have added extra flights to and from Moscow Sheremetyevo airport to cope with the demand.

For travel on Friday 11 March, the return fare from London Heathrow is £544. But on some dates for future travel, for example 4 April, the price falls by more than half to £249 return.

Air Serbia also offers connections from Amsterdam, Athens, Berlin and Rome via Belgrade to Moscow.

The aviation data analysts, ForwardKeys, reports that capacity scheduled in the first week of March rose by around 50 per cent.

This corresponds to an increase from two to three flights per day between Belgrade and Moscow.

The firm also says that 60 per cent more flight tickets were issued for travel from Russia to another destination via Serbia in the week immediately after the invasion than during the whole of January.

Olivier Ponti, vice-president for insights for ForwardKeys, said: “What’s most notable is the speed with which Serbia has become the gateway for travel between Russia and Europe.”

During January, 85 per cent of transfers from Russia via Serbia were to the neighbouring republic of Montenegro.

In the week after the invasion, the figure fell to 40 per cent as Serbia became a hub for onward travel to western Europe.

The Independent has found that several of the world’s leading airlines – including Emirates, Etihad, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines – are still operating from their hubs to Russian cities. Each of these carriers has been asked to comment on continuing operations in Russia.

Turkish Airlines has four flights a day from Istanbul to Moscow plus two to St Petersburg.

For a same-day departure from Manchester via Istanbul to Moscow Vnukovo, the Turkish carrier is charging £842 return.

The airline has temporarily suspended services from Istanbul to the southern Russian cities of Rostov and Sochi.

Up to this point, all European Union Member States, as well as Albania, Switzerland, Canada, Norway, and the United Kingdom, have banned airlines of Russia from entering their airspace. Authorities in Moscow have taken similar measures, banning all flights from these countries from entering their airspace, SchengenVisaInfo.com reports.

Amid raised safety concerns, the military attack on Ukraine by Russia has raised serious questions about whether it is safe to fly to and within Europe.

Besides, the war in Ukraine has also affected many European airlines, with airBaltic, Austrian Airlines, British Airways, Jet2, KLM, Lufthansa, Ryanair, Scandinavian Airlines, Swiss International Airlines, and Wizz Air being the most affected ones, as reported by Euronews.

airBaltic

Amid raised safety concerns, the Latvian airline has suspended all flights to Russia until the end of May. Russian authorities have also taken reciprocity measures.

“Due to the airspace limitations, a small number of airBaltic routes are adjusted, without a significant increase in the flight time,” a spokesperson from the airline said.

Austrian Airlines

Following the example of other airlines, Austrian Airlines has also suspended flights to Ukraine until March 26. At the same time, flights to Kyiv and Odessa have been cancelled since February 21.

Regarding flights to neighbouring countries, the airline said that “We continue to monitor the situation closely and are in close contact with national and international authorities. The safety of our passengers and crew members is our top priority at all times.”

British Airways

British Airways has also cancelled its flights to Russia’s capital, warning that such a decision would lead to rerouting some services to Asia, causing longer journey time.

Russian authorities have also been banned from landing at Russian airports.

Jet2

The airline has suspended all flights to Poland, at the same time cancelling flights to Krakow from late March until the end of May. Such a decision was announced through a statement published by the airline on March 9.

KLM

The Dutch airline has also cancelled all flights to Russia.

In this regard, the airline said the decision was prompted by sanctions imposed by EU states.

“This means KLM can no longer guarantee that flights to Russia or passing over Russian territory can return safely,” the statement reads.

Lufthansa

The German airline Lufthansa has also suspended flights to Russia.

“Lufthansa Group continues to monitor the situation closely and is in close exchange with national and international authorities,” a spokesperson pointed out in this regard.

First, the Federal Aviation Administration will issue a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) that will prohibit Russian airlines and operators from using US airspace. As of the publication of this post, the NOTAM has not yet been issued, but is anticipated to be issued today.

Second, the USDOT has issued a Notice and Order, effective immediately, suspending “the existing, proposed, and prospective scheduled passenger and all-cargo operations of all foreign air carriers of the Russian Federation (Russia) to and/or from the United States.” The order also suspends the authority of all Russian foreign civil aircraft operators to navigate in the United States.

Special to USA TODAY

Following the invasion of Ukraine, the European Union closed its airspace to all Russian airline, Russian-owned and Russian-operated aircraft. Soon after, Russia closed its airspace to all European aircraft. More countries like Canada have since followed the EU, consequently, the number of aircraft and flights affected increased.

So what does all of this mean to air travelers?

The most immediate effect is on travelers to and from Russia. Many flights are canceled, and some have been forced to turn around. One Aeroflot flight was nearing Canada airspace when the ban was announced and had to return to Russia.

Another Aeroflot flight en route from Miami to Moscow was mistakenly allowed to transit Canada. The controlling authority, NAV Canada, admitted the mistake and said that corrective action had been taken to prevent a reoccurrence.

As a result of losing access to Canadian airspace, Aeroflot has been canceling flights to their four destinations in the U.S. (New York, Washington, Los Angeles and Miami), as well as Cancun, Mexico, and Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic.

And last week, Delta Air Lines suspended its code-sharing agreement with Aeroflot, which is Russia's national airline.

During the State of the Union speech, President Joe Biden announced the U.S. is closing off airspace to all Russian flights, joining a growing number of countries around the world that have made similar moves in recent days.

Longer routes, fewer diversion airports

More consequences of the closing of airspace are the necessity to reroute some flights, adding flight time and increasing fuel costs.

Flights, for example, from London to Asia now fly much further south to avoid Russian airspace. Polar flights from the U.S. to Asia can no longer use Russia as alternate airports. Should an emergency such as engine failure occur, no Russian airport can be a diversion airport.

Under Long Range Operational Performance Standards, aircraft are rated by how long it would take to reach the nearest diversion airport. For newer, more efficient long-haul aircraft like the Airbus A-350, the limit is 370 minutes. For smaller twin-engine planes, the limit is lower.

Some polar flights must have Russian airports as an available diversion airport. Losing those airports mean that the flights must go much further south and may require a technical stop for fuel, which dramatically increases flight time and cost.

'IT WILL BE A LOT HARDER ON PEOPLE': How sanctions will impact ordinary Russians

The airspace over Ukraine is, of course, closed, requiring all air traffic to route around it.

The rules for closing airspace were tightened after the Russian military shot down Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 over eastern Ukraine in 2014. Hence, no civilian aircraft are flying over Ukraine until the conflict subsides.

In the meantime, any plans for travel that might overfly Russia or any of Eastern Europe should include regular information from your airline to see the departure time, flight time and other possible changes, such as a technical stop.

HOW TO PRESSURE PUTIN: Do Russia's yacht-owning oligarchs hold the key?

Fewer planes flying in Russia due to parts shortages, leased aircraft recall

Secondary issues include a ban on aircraft parts to Russian operators. Aircraft will be soon be grounded due to lack of needed parts. This will cause cancellations of domestic flights. Many Russian operators fly European, and U.S.-built aircraft. Once the flow of the parts stops, the reliability of the airlines will be adversely affected.

Meanwhile, a number of leased Russian planes will be recalled or seized in the next few weeks because the latest EU sanctions cut off the supply of planes, parts and technology to that country and its ability to insure planes starting March 28. This will impact Russian air travel as well.

For the aircraft that aren't recalled, it remains to be seen how airlines can make their payments after several major Russian banks were removed from SWIFT, a communications network linking financial institutions worldwide.

Already, European-based aircraft leasing companies are scrambling to recover billions from Russian airlines before the EU's embargo on planes and supplies kick in on March 28. They've also recalled some planes and could seize more.

All of us hope the conflict in Ukraine will end quickly and peacefully. Until then, travelers need to factor the fighting there into their planning. But know that the airlines are doing all they can to maintain our very high level of safety during this challenging time.

Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized a military operation in eastern Ukraine on Thursday in what appeared to be the start of a war in Europe.

Ukraine State Air Traffic Services Enterprise said on its website that the country's airspace was closed to civilian flights starting at 12:45 a.m. GMT on Thursday and that air traffic services had been suspended.

Following the decision, Turkish Airlines announced early Thursday that it has canceled all flights to Ukraine. The national flag carrier was operating flights to Kyiv, Kherson, Kharkiv, Lviv, Lviv, Mykolaiv, Odessa and Zaporizhzhia.

Turkey's low-cost carrier, Pegasus Airlines, also announced Thursday via a Twitter statement that it has canceled all flights to Ukraine after the country’s air space was closed.

“Due to the closure of the Ukrainian airspace, our flights to Ukraine, dating 24.02.2022 have been cancelled,” the statement read.

The airport in Belarus' capital Minsk has cancelled all flights to the south.

""Today, flights from the National Airport to Istanbul, Tel Aviv and Sochi have been cancelled,"" it said in a statement.

The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said airspace in Russia and Belarus within 100 nautical miles (185 kilometers) of their borders with Ukraine could also pose safety risks to airlines.

""In particular, there is a risk of both intentional targeting and misidentification of civil aircraft,"" the agency said in a conflict zone bulletin.

""The presence and possible use of a wide range of ground and airborne warfare systems pose a high risk for civil flights operating at all altitudes and flight levels.""

Russia has also suspended domestic flights to and from a number of airports near its border with Ukraine until the early hours of March 2, its federal aviation agency Rosaviatsiya said in a statement on Thursday.

Flights at airports in the cities of Rostov-on-Don, Krasnodar, Anapa, Gelendzhik, Belgorod, Voronezh and Stavropol, among others, are temporarily suspended, the agency said.

The aviation industry has taken heightened notice of the risks the conflicts pose to civil aviation since Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine in 2014.

EASA said Russia's Defense Ministry had sent an urgent message to Ukraine warning of high risk to flight safety due to the use of weapons and military equipment from 12:45 a.m. GMT on Thursday and asked Ukraine's air traffic control to stop flights.

Flight tracking websites showed early morning traffic skirting the whole country in crowded corridors to the north and west.

An El Al flight from Tel Aviv to Toronto made a sudden U-turn out of Ukraine's airspace around the time the airspace was closed, according to flight tracking website FlightRadar24.

A LOT Polish Airlines flight from Warsaw to Kyiv also turned back to Warsaw around the same time.

Hours before then, Safe Airspace, which was set up to provide safety and conflict zone information after the downing of MH17, said it had increased its risk level over all of Ukraine to ""do not fly.""

It also warned of the potential for a cyberattack on Ukraine's air traffic control.

Russia has also closed some airspace in the Rostov sector to the east of its border with Ukraine ""in order to provide safety"" for civil aviation flights, according to a notice to airmen.

Before Ukraine advised of the airspace restrictions, the United States, Italy, Canada, France and Britain had told their airlines to avoid certain airspace above eastern Ukraine and Crimea but stopped short of a total ban.

Germany's Lufthansa halted flights to Ukraine from Monday, joining KLM which already suspended flights.

The European Union closed all airspace across its 27 countries to Russian airplanes on Sunday, following a steady stream of announcements of airspace closures from member countries over the weekend.

In response to the EU ban, the Russian Civil Aviation Authority announced on Monday that it has closed off its airspace to the carriers of 36 countries.

The United Kingdom closed its airspace to Russian aircraft on Thursday, with Russia responding with its own UK ban on Friday.

Canadian airspace is also closed to Russian aircraft operators.

The number of canceled flights to and from Moscow’s Sheremetyevo International Airport ranked highest worldwide as of mid-day Monday as western governments closed airspace to Russian aircraft.

One in every five departing and arriving flights from Sheremetyevo have been canceled as of 12:30 p.m. ET Monday, according to data on flight tracking site FlightAware. The airport is the largest in Russia, according to its website.

Lask week, Ukraine’s airspace closed in the wake of the Russian invasion. Ukraine’s neighbor Moldova also closed its airspace, as did part of Belarus.

The conflict could redraw the world air map.

Meanwhile, the US government’s Federal Aviation Administration told US pilots last week to avoid “the entire country of Ukraine, the entire country of Belarus and a western portion of Russia.”

The European Union Aviation Safety Agency, known as EASA, has warned of a “high risk” to civilian aircraft flying near the Ukrainian border.

Countries including the United States and the United Kingdom have advised their citizens to leave Ukraine, and both the US and the UK have advised against all travel to Ukraine and Russia.

Here’s what we know about how travel in Eastern Europe and Russia might be impacted in the wake of the conflict.

Can I still fly to Eastern Europe?

Air traffic is still moving outside of severely affected areas. As well as bordering Russia, Ukraine also neighbors Belarus, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Moldova, as the map above illustrates.

EASA doubled the size of the warning zone around Ukraine on February 25, fearing “mid-range missiles penetrating into controlled airspace.”

The zone expanded from within 100 nautical miles to within 200 nautical miles of the Ukrainian border with Russia. EASA says the expanded area now factors in the “risk posed by the threat of missile launches to and from Ukraine.”

Moldova has closed its airspace, while Belarus has banned flights over part of the country.

All countries bordering Ukraine were already on the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Level 4 list of highest-risk Covid-19 destinations for travel. The US government also warns against traveling to Belarus and Moldova due to the conflict.

Florida-based travel adviser Gwen Kozlowski, a specialist in travel to central Europe and president of travel agency Exeter International, told CNN Travel on February 24 that her agency has had questions from travelers with upcoming trips to Poland.

“We have guests traveling at the end of March and into April in Poland, but that’s over a month out. It’s impossible to say now how this will evolve. We’re basically in wait-and-see mode,” Kozlowski said via email.

Przemysłlaw Marczewski, a representative for the national Polish Tourism Organisation told CNN Travel on February 25 that “travel to Poland is smooth, and the borders of the Republic of Poland with neighboring countries are not closed.”

Marczewski noted that Polish land borders with Ukraine have been open to refugees and that the travel industry is supporting the citizens of Ukraine with temporary accommodation in hotels.

Tourists with near-term plans to visit Poland are advised to book accommodations in advance, “as part of the hotel infrastructure may be earmarked for those in need.”

My flight is supposed to be flying over Ukrainian airspace. Will it be rerouted?

If you are flying on a route that would usually cross currently blocked-off airspace, the airline will reroute the flight.

Imagery from February 24 from aircraft tracker ADS-B Exchange showed empty airspace over Ukraine and its Russian border.

“For aviation, safety is always the top priority,” said Willie Walsh, the director general of the International Air Transport Association airline industry body, in a statement provided to CNN Travel on February 24.

“IATA is helping to facilitate the relevant and timely sharing of information with airlines from government and non-government sources to support airlines as they plan their operations around airspace closures in Ukraine and parts of Russia.”

Can I still travel to Russia?

Countries including the UK and US have issued warnings on travel to Russia due to the current conflict.

Current flight and airspace restrictions also make travel to and from Russia difficult.

Russian airspace on the border with Ukraine is closed to civilian flights. There are also some restrictions on domestic flights within Russia.

EU airspace is closed to Russian aircraft, as is UK and Canadian airspace.

“These aircraft will no more be able to land in, take off or overfly the territory of the European Union. This will apply to any plane”, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on February 28, confirming the news.

As of February 28, Russian airspace is closed to 36 countries.

As well as the UK, which was banned from Russian airspace last week, all EU nations including France, Italy and Spain are now prevented from operating in Russian airspace.

Delta Air Lines has suspended its codeshare with Russian national airline Aeroflot.

The US State Department issued a Level 4: Do Not Travel advisory for Russia in January and updated it on February 28 citing the “unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces in Ukraine, the potential for harassment against US citizens by Russian government security officials, the embassy’s limited ability to assist US citizens in Russia,” as well as Covid-19 and other factors.

The United Kingdom updated its advisory to citizens on February 28, broadening a warning against travel to certain parts of Russia to advising against all travel to Russia.

Canadian citizens are advised to avoid non-essential travel to Russia due to the conflict, and avoid all travel within 50 kilometers of the Ukraine border.

Meanwhile, popular travel author Rick Steves, who organizes tours, announced Thursday he is canceling tours in Russia for the remainder of the year.

“Our mission at (Rick Steves’ Europe) is to help Americans understand the world through travel,” Steves Tweeted. “But when we bring travelers to Russia, we also bring their dollars — dollars that would support Putin’s aggression. We have now canceled all 2022 tours to Russia.”

How long will travel be affected?

The situation in Ukraine is fast-moving. It is unclear how long airspace over Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus or Russia will be impacted.

According to the UK government’s travel advisory, restrictions on domestic flights in Russia are currently set to be in place through March 2.

Ukraine International Airlines, which sent part of its fleet to safety abroad last week, diverted one Kyiv-bound flight to Moldova. Some of its planes remained grounded in Kyiv.

Hungary's Wizz Air (WIZZ.L) said it was trying to evacuate Ukrainian-based crew, their families and four aircraft.

In the London insurance world, underwriters acted swiftly to contain their risks.

Leading war-risk insurers cut the notice period to 24 hours for cancellation of policies for Ukrainian airlines, said Bruce Carman, chief underwriting officer at Hive Aero in London.

Airline shares fluctuated, with an index of major European carriers down 6% and U.S carriers erasing early losses, as some analysts warned of a sanctions war forcing carriers to fly longer routes.

Britain said it had banned all Russian airlines including Aeroflot which operates daily to London, from entering its airspace or landing on its soil.

Airlines and companies that control jets worth billions of dollars have voiced concerns about the risk of Russia closing its own airspace as part of tit-for-tat sanctions. read more

""While that would be Russia shooting itself in the foot, I can't dismiss it once the sanctions start to bite,"" said airline analyst Robert Mann.

Air corridors between parts of Europe or North America and Asia stretch across Russia, generating overflight fees.

The crisis also cast a shadow over wider travel demand for the third northern summer in a row, after two years of pandemic.

U.S. carriers have been boosting capacity, expecting a surge in demand to Europe. But the conflict might force travellers to change plans, Mann said.

Those that do fly are likely to face higher ticket prices after oil jumped above $100 a barrel on Thursday.

Russia meanwhile suspended domestic flights to and from several airports near its border with Ukraine, including Rostov-on-Don, Krasnodar and Stavropol, until March 2.

A notice to pilots said the move was ""to provide safety"" for civil flights.

The measure is set to go into effect from 3pm local time.

Several countries, including Bulgaria, Poland and the Czech Republic, have closed their airspace to Russian carriers.

Meanwhile, Estonia, Latvia and Slovenia on Saturday also said they would ban Russian flights.

“We invite all EU countries to do the same,” Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas tweeted, adding, “There is no place for planes of the aggressor state in democratic skies”.

Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa quoted Kallas’s tweet saying, “Slovenia will do the same”.

Latvian Transport Minister Talis Linkaits also said on Twitter that “Latvia will close its airspace to Russian-registered airlines for commercial flights,” adding that the decision would be formally approved at the next cabinet meeting.

The United Kingdom has banned Russian flagship carrier Aeroflot from flying over the UK.

While many airlines are still using Russia’s east-west transit corridors, some have begun asking about capacity in Anchorage, harking back to Alaska’s Cold War use as a refuelling hub for jets barred from Soviet airspace.

Western airlines, lessors and manufacturers were assessing the growing risks of doing business with Russia as sanctions targeted Russian companies, banks and individuals.

Delta Air Lines said it was suspending a codesharing service with Russia’s Aeroflot.

“It will be more difficult for investors to accept portfolios of aircraft assets containing Russian airlines. Nobody wants to take Russian risk today,” aviation adviser Bertrand Grabowski said, adding that fears included a lack of insurance coverage.

Russian forces were closing on Ukraine’s capital on Friday in the biggest attack on a European state since World War II.

Airspace in Ukraine, Moldova, parts of Belarus and in southern Russia near the Ukraine border has been closed, giving airlines a narrower range of routing options.

Japan Airlines on Thursday cancelled a flight to Moscow, citing potential safety risks, and the United Kingdom closed its airspace to Russian airlines, including Aeroflot, as part of a raft of punitive measures.

In response, Moscow barred UK airlines from landing at its airports or crossing its airspace, citing “unfriendly decisions” by London.

Russian airline S7 announced Friday it was suspending all of its flights to Europe, citing sanctions imposed on Moscow over the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine.

“Due to the closure of airspace by European countries, S7 Airlines has decided to cancel all flights to Europe from February 26 to March 13,” the company said in a statement carried by Russian news agencies.

Virgin Atlantic said skirting Russia would add 15 minutes to an hour to its flights between UK and India and Pakistan.

American Airlines Group Inc said it had re-routed its Delhi-New York flight. Rival United Airlines, however, was still using Russia’s airspace for Delhi-Chicago and Delhi-Newark flights, according to Flightradar24.

Gulf carrier Emirates said it had made minor routing changes, leading to slightly longer flight times. United Parcel Service Inc said it was implementing contingency plans.

OPSGROUP, an aviation industry cooperative that shares information on flight risks, said any aircraft travelling through Russian airspace should have such contingency plans in place for closed airspace due to risks, or sanctions.

Revenue from Russian overflights goes to state carrier Aeroflot.

“Russia are unlikely to initiate their own sanctions and airspace bans as they would not wish to see Aeroflot receive reciprocal bans,” OPSGROUP said. “However, they may react in response to sanctions from other states.”

Airlines were also reeling from a rise in oil prices to more than $105 a barrel for the first time since 2014.

That raises operating costs at a time when travel demand remains low because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Rating agency Fitch said airlines’ profits and cash flows could suffer if crude prices continued to rise or stayed high.

Jefferies analysts said European airlines were likely to take a longer-term hit in light of the conflict.

A network of millions of parts has also been affected.

Washington announced export controls on goods including aircraft parts. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU also planned to stop exporting such parts to Russia. The United States said there would be steps to uphold safety.

“(W)e believe that sanctions and export control activities should not hinder the need to maintain flight safety of commercial aircraft,” said Eric Fanning, chief executive of the US-based Aerospace Industries Association.

Russian airlines have 980 jets in service, of which 777 are leased, according to analytics firm Cirium. Of these, 515 with an estimated market value of $10 billion are rented from abroad.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2022/2/25/update-5-airlines-tackle-russia-risks-as-ukraine-fallout-widens
