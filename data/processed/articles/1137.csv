Missiles hit the western city of Lviv and Ukrainian counterattacks retook several villages from Russian forces on Saturday, according to local officials.

Here are some of the developments on the ground as of Saturday:

Lviv: The western city and cultural hub was hit by a series of airstrikes, with air raid sirens going on and off throughout the day. Three powerful blasts were heard in the center of the city, and plumes of thick black smoke could be seen rising in the distance. The missiles struck a fuel storage facility and a military infrastructure site, injuring at least five people. No deaths have been reported so far. Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi called for air defense of Ukraine after the strikes.

Kyiv: The city's Mayor Vitali Klitschko canceled an extended curfew planned for the capital. In a statement on Telegram, Klitschko said the curfew — planned to begin Saturday at 8:00 p.m. local time and run until 7:00 a.m. on Monday — would not be introduced.

Suburbs in west and east of Kyiv: The Kyiv region's military administration said Saturday that suburbs to the west and east of the capital had come under Russian shellfire and in some districts Russian forces were digging in. The western suburbs of Маkariv, Bucha and Irpin were being shelled, and the community of Bilohorodka had come under rocket attack and missile strikes, according to Oleksandr Pavliuk, the head of the Kyiv regional military administration. Pavliuk added that Russian forces were attempting to fortify positions in Bucha and another western suburb, Nemishaeve.

Slavutych, north of Kyiv: Russian troops entered the city of Slavutych after several days of shelling, a move that sparked protests among hundreds of Ukrainian civilians. The city was built to house workers of the nearby Chornobyl nuclear power plant and the UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said it was monitoring the situation.

Kharkiv: Ukrainian forces have staged a counteroffensive in areas around Ukraine's second-largest city Kharkiv, local officials said. A counterattack that began on Friday to the east of Kharkiv led to the recapture of several villages, according to the regional administrator Oleg Synegubov. He said a number of villages around Malaya Rogan were retaken by Ukrainian forces. The villages are roughly 20 kilometers (12 miles) from central Kharkiv, which has been nearly encircled by Russian forces since the early weeks of the invasion.

Ukrainian counterattacks: The success of Ukrainian forces around Kharkiv has been mirrored further north, near the city of Sumy, where Ukrainian troops have liberated a number of settlements, according to videos geolocated and verified by CNN. A separate counterattack in the south also led to the liberation of two villages from Russian forces northwest of Mariupol, according to the Zaporizhzhia regional military administration. And Ukrainian counterattacks north and west of the capital appeared to have made some headway earlier this week, with Ukrainian forces restoring control of the town of Makariv, some 40 miles west of Kyiv.

Chernihiv: The mayor of the northern city said Chernihiv is surrounded by Russian troops. There is no stable electricity supply, and water is delivered by volunteers as the water supply hasn't been fully restored. ""The enemy consciously destroyed the only bridge connecting Chernihiv with a southern highway towards Kyiv,"" Mayor Vladyslav Atroshenko said. ""There are currently no humanitarian corridors or any safe way to bring or supplies, aid or wounded in or out."" He said the population has more than halved since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.",https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-27-22/h_b92b79ca0027cd3d07e53c80caf08bd0

Lviv governor Maksym Kozytskyy said there had been two missile strikes at about 2.45pm UK time. Shortly before 5pm, the governor said there had been three more explosions.

It is understood an oil depot was hit in the first attack. Five people were injured in the initial strikes, Mr Kozytskyy said.

Both he and the city's mayor, Andriy Sadovyi, urged people to stay indoors. ""Stay in the shelters!"" Mr Kozytskyy said. ""Don't walk down the street! Don't take pictures of anything! Do not read information in anonymous Telegram channels and do not spread it from there!""

Footage from the first strikes showed plumes of heavy black smoke in the sky near the city. Sky News correspondent Sally Lockwood, who is at the scene, heard air raid sirens and said there were reports of jets flying over.

Flashes and loud bangs could be heard from the site in the hours after the attack, she said, describing it as an ""active situation"". The later explosions are believed to have hit a defence facility.

There are concerns that an ""enormous"" fire that has broken out, close to homes and two petrol stations, could spread due to high winds, and police and soldiers have been moving people away from the area.

""There are a number of apartment blocks in the vicinity of the fire and there are lots of people out looking at the fire,"" Lockwood said. Many people are emotional, some are quite angry - there are high emotions, certainly.""

Mr Sadovyi said the strikes were by rockets that had been fired from Sevastopol in Crimea.

The attack happened as US president Joe Biden was over the border in Warsaw, Poland.

""There's some commentary here to suggest there is no coincidence... that this is a message to President Biden,"" Lockwood said.

Defence and security analyst Michael Clarke told Sky News: ""The Russians are using the missiles to probe for supply routes and depots and stuff that's coming in from Poland, so every time they think they see something around Lviv, I think they go for it.""

Lviv, a city of more than 700,000 people roughly 45 miles east of Ukraine's border with Poland, has been largely spared of major attacks in recent weeks.

Russia says footage 'from Black Sea' shows missile launch targeting region west of Kyiv

Earlier, Russia claimed it had launched missile strikes on Ukrainian military infrastructure from the Black Sea in the northwestern city of Zhytomyr - around 96 miles from the capital of Kyiv.

A crew of a small missile ship off the Black Sea Fleet launched four Kalibr cruise missiles at military facilities belonging to the Ukrainian Armed Forces from the Black Sea, Russia's Ministry of Defence said.

""As a result of an accurate hit, the high-precision weaponry destroyed weapons and military equipment depot on the territory of Zhytomyr Region,"" it said, in a Facebook post with footage of the blasts.

Russia appeared to be scaling back its ambitions in Ukraine to focus on consolidating control of eastern areas, but the UK warmed that the bombardment of cities would likely continue.

Another video released by the Defence Ministry on Saturday allegedly showed an airstrike on a Ukrainian Buk missile system performed by an Iskander missile in the Kyiv region - causing a huge explosion.

Russia has previously pointed to far bigger ambitions but stiff resistance from Ukraine forces, logistical problems and reported low morale may have taken their toll as its forces have been unable to seize any major Ukrainian city more than four weeks into the conflict.

Chernobyl workers' town 'seized' by Russian forces

Vladimir Putin's forces have taken control of the town of Slavutych, where workers at the defunct Chernobyl nuclear plant live, the governor of Kyiv region Oleksandr Pavlyuk said on Saturday.

Mr Pavlyuk wrote in an online post that Russian troops had occupied the hospital in Slavutych and kidnapped the mayor. The reports are yet to be verified.

However, Sky News verified a video located to Slavutych showing demonstrators gathered outside Slavutych City Hall while gunfire can be heard.

Yesterday, Ukraine said its troops had repulsed the first attack by Russian troops closing in on the town.

Chernihiv 'surrounded by the enemy'

The Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, in the north of the country, has been cut off by Russian forces, its regional governor said on Friday.

""The city has been conditionally, operationally surrounded by the enemy,"" Viacheslav Chaus said, adding that it was being bombarded by artillery and warplanes.

Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk earlier said that Ukraine wanted to open a humanitarian corridor in Chernihiv on Saturday.

In the eastern city of Kharkiv, four people were killed on Friday when Russian shelling hit a clinic providing humanitarian aid, regional police said.

There is also increasing evidence of mass graves in Mariupol - including one that appears to hold 200 bodies - the head of the UN's human rights team in Ukraine has said.

Ten humanitarian corridors confirmed for today

Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk announced on Saturday that 10 human corridors had been confirmed for the day across the country.

It comes as Ukraine's prosecutor general office announced that at least 136 children have died since the Russian invasion a month ago.

Speaking on national television, she said civilians trying to flee the besieged port city of Mariupol would have to

leave in private cars as Russian forces were not letting buses through their checkpoints.

Ms Vereshchuk added that more than 100,000 people needed to be evacuated from the city.

On Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy again appealed to Russia to negotiate an end to the war, but said his country would not agree to give up any of its territories for the sake of peace.

Vladimir Putin's forces are under great strain in many parts of the country as the US and other countries have accelerated their transfer of arms and supplies to Ukraine.

However, the UK's Ministry of Defence published a map of the areas in Ukraine under Russian assault on Saturday - showing that Putin's forces are showing little sign of letting up.

It shows Kyiv continuing to be encircled, as well as predicting advances into more cities in the north and south of the country by Russian troops.

The US also said Russian forces were no longer in full control of Kherson, the first city to fall after the invasion began.

It's another apparent boost for Ukraine, which also claimed to have destroyed a Russian landing ship near the coastal city of Berdyansk this week.

'300 killed in theatre attack'

Despite the counterattacks, the death toll mounts - and the council in the southern city of Mariupol said on Friday that it believed about 300 people had died in the bombing of a theatre last week.

It would make it the worst single loss of life in the month-long war.

3,9f92db1d-5e17-4b13-8d67-a16e199de1cd,[],,"Ukrainians disrupt and derail Russian offensive as war moves to new phase

Originally Published: 27 MAR 22 10:00 ET

Updated: 27 MAR 22 13:18 ET

By Tim Lister, Paul P. Murphy and Celine Alkhaldi, (CNN) -- Just over a month after the first ballistic missiles slammed into Kyiv's international airport, the Russian campaign has been disrupted and derailed by stubborn Ukrainian resistance -- and in the last few days by agile Ukrainian counterattacks on several fronts.

Russian forces retain considerable -- but not overwhelming -- numerical superiority. Their armored groups have struggled against Western-supplied anti-tank weapons and Turkish-made drones. Ukrainian air defenses have punched above their weight and are now being reinforced by thousands of US-made Stinger missiles.

Poor logistical support, questionable tactics and growing evidence of poor morale among Russian battalion tactical groups have allowed the Ukrainian military to hold off Russian advances in several regions -- and begin to take the fight to the enemy.

CNN analysis of satellite imagery, social media content and official statements from both sides suggests the conflict may now be moving into a new phase: a war of attrition in which the Russians may lose more ground than they gain and suffer even greater resupply issues as the Ukrainians cut into their extended lines.

There are indications that the Russian military is trying to compensate for this by greater use of missile forces and indirect fire from artillery and multiple launch rocket systems. To the north and west of Kyiv, for example, the Russians appear to be digging in rather than seeking to advance, shelling areas like Irpin and Makariv, where Ukrainian troops have established a tenuous hold.

In the last two weeks, there's been an uptick in Russian missile strikes, from Lviv in the west to Zhytomyr in central Ukraine and Mykolaiv in the south, with prime targets being fuel dumps, military depots and airfields.

Ukraine goes on the attack

The Ukrainians have been mostly circumspect about going on the offensive, but on Friday National Security Adviser Oleksiy Danilov said: ""We are going on the counterattack in some areas, and this counterattack is absolutely productive.""

These fightbacks are limited and focused but include fronts in the south, central Ukraine and the northeast.

The Institute for the Study of War, in its latest assessment, describes them as ""prudent and effective, allowing Ukrainian forces to regain small areas of tactically or operationally significant terrain without overextending themselves.""

The south

The push towards the Russian-occupied city of Kherson is perhaps the most ambitious. After resisting attempts by Russian forces to take Mykolaiv -- a bridgehead for assaulting Odesa -- the Ukrainians launched devastating missile attacks against the Russian command at Kherson's airport (killing a Russian general in the process, they say) and gained ground to the north of the city. This as civil disobedience in the city has frayed the nerves of Russian troops.

On Sunday, a large crowd took to the streets of Kakhovka -- east of Kherson -- to protest Russian occupation. A local journalist, Oleh Baturin, told CNN that Russian forces still controlled the area. Kakhovka matters because it's close to a bridge linking Kherson with points east. A Russian land corridor linking Crimea with its border would be hard to sustain without that access.

Baturin said there was heavy fighting near the nearby town of Tavriysk and Nova Kakhovka, where there was a large concentration of Russian forces.

How this battle evolves could have a major bearing on the Russian campaign in the south.

The northeast

Perhaps surprisingly, Ukrainian units have also gained territory close to the Russian border, around the cities of Kharkiv and Sumy. Kharkiv, just 30 miles from the Russian border, has been under almost constant attack since the first day of the invasion but remains in Ukrainian hands.

Ukrainian forces now appear to have retaken some outlying areas. Oleh Syniehubov, the head of the Kharkiv regional administration, claimed Saturday that ""several settlements were liberated"" east of the city.

A long video analyzed by CNN showed an assault by troops of the ultra-nationalist Azov Battalion on a village near Kharkiv in which they took a number of Russian prisoners, some of them apparently badly wounded. Other videos showed a string of villages south of Kharkiv now in Ukrainian hands.

Russian forces continue a weeks-long attempt to take Izium, to the south of Kharkiv, but Ukrainian resistance continues in the heavily damaged city.

A local official, Maksym Strelnyk, said Sunday that ""currently, the situation in Izium is extremely complicated. Fierce fighting continues.""

Still in the northeast, CNN has geo-located video and images showing Ukrainian forces back in control of the town of Trostyanets, some 30 miles from the city of Sumy, with Russian armor including a T-80 tank and infantry fighting vehicles damaged and abandoned.

The Ukrainian 93rd Brigade posted images on its Facebook account showing its soldiers in Trostyanets, and said the Russians had fled -- ""leaving behind weapons, equipment and ammunition.""

Near Kyiv

Just east of Kyiv the last few days have seen Ukrainian gains in a largely rural area some 40 miles (70 kms) from the capital, around the villages of Lukyanivka and Rudnytske. If sustained, these gains could complicate an already long Russian supply chain and even cut off forward Russian units.

It's not all one-way traffic. The city of Chernihiv north of Kyiv is still surrounded by Russian forces, which have also entered the nearby city of Slavutych this weekend. Social media videos showed them in control of the center of the city, using stun grenades and bursts of automatic fire into the air as a crowd of several hundred Ukrainian civilians protested.

And the Russians retain the ability to shell the outskirts of Kyiv from the north.

Moscow's shifting language

As their ground campaign falters, Russian officials have asserted that encircling Ukrainian cities actually serves an ulterior goal: to pin down Ukrainian forces and prevent them from focusing on the separatist regions of Donbas.

Colonel General Sergei Rudskoy, first deputy chief of Russia's General Staff, said Friday that laying siege to Ukrainian cities and damaging military infrastructure ""allow us not only to tie down their forces and prevent them from strengthening their grouping in the Donbas.""

In announcing the special military operation on February 24, President Vladimir Putin said it was aimed at securing Donbas -- the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk -- from an alleged Ukrainian assault.

Rudskoy appeared to reference that, saying, ""In general, the main tasks of the first stage of the operation have been completed."" The Russian intention was never to storm Ukrainian cities, he insisted, adding that while the possibility was not excluded ""our forces and means will be concentrated on the main thing -- the complete liberation of Donbas.""

But Rudskoy also referred to a more ambitious goal of Putin, the so-called ""demilitarization and denazification"" of Ukraine.

The available evidence suggests Russian forces are edging forward on the fringes of Donbas. But a significant component of those forces has been itself tied down in the grueling siege of Mariupol. Losses there will affect their ability to project force elsewhere in the southeast.

The Institute for the Study of War said Rudskoy's comments ""could indicate that Russia has scaled back its aims and would now be satisfied with controlling the entirety of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts, but that reading is likely inaccurate.""

The ISW says: ""The absence of significant Russian offensive operations throughout most of Ukraine likely reflects the inability of the Russian military to generate sufficient combat power to attack rather than any decision in Moscow to change Russia's war aims or concentrate on the east.""

The Ukrainian armed forces command appears unconvinced too, saying that Russian units are reorganizing and consolidating to replace combat losses.

All of which suggests a second and possibly still bloodier phase of the conflict is about to begin, as Russia tries to reinvigorate a faltering campaign on the ground while doubling down on its use of cruise and ballistic missiles.

IAEA concerned over lack of staff rotation at Chernobyl

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been informed that Russian forces have seized Slavutych, where many people working at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant live.

The UN nuclear watchdog’s chief, Rafael Grossi, said he remained concerned about the ability of the site’s staff to regularly rotate and return to their homes to rest, read a statement from the IAEA, adding that there has been no personnel rotation for nearly a week.

A ‘muted response’

Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan, reporting from Kyiv, has described a “muted response” to Biden’s forceful speech in Warsaw from some Ukrainian officials.

“The speech didn’t give Ukrainians nothing new, it was much more a sum up of the US position when it comes to Ukraine, but Ukrainians don’t want to talk about sanctions, about refugees or humanitarian aid being delivered,” Khan said, noting that they were rather seeking stronger practical support, including more weapons and the ability to close the sky.

Khan referred as an example to a tweet by Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, who said: “Listened to the speech @POTUS delivered in Rzeszow. It’s 170 kilometers from Lviv. And 80 kilometers from Ukraine-NATO border”.

‘We stand with you. Period’: Biden

The US President has framed the war as being much more consequential than just one country invading another one, but rather as a battle between democracy and autocracy, Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett said, commenting on Biden’s speech at Warsaw’s Royal Castle.

“He took various historical examples showing how people collectively were able to overcome the authoritarian rule of the Soviet Union,” Halkett said. Biden said Russia “has strangled democracy and sought to do so elsewhere” and told Ukraine: “We stand with you. Period.”

Biden moved on to highlight what he believes has been a collective response by the West, including an unprecedented package of sanctions that have reduced the Russian rouble into “rubble”. He added that “swift and punishing costs is the only thing that will get Russia to change course”.

Biden stressed that US forces are in Europe to defend NATO allies, not to engage with Russian forces. He said, however, in the most animated passage of his speech: “Don’t even think about moving onto one single inch of NATO territory.”

The president also spoke directly to Russia’s residents: “Let me say this if you’re able to listen … You the Russian people are not our enemy.”

The city, located near Ukraine’s border with Russia and Belarus, now has just half of its usual 285,000 inhabitants, he said. Atroshenko also described the current conditions in the city as catastrophic. Chernihiv was without power, he said, and it was impossible to establish escape corridors since Russian forces destroyed a bridge leading towards Kyiv.

“In basements at night, everyone is talking about one thing: Chernihiv becoming (the) next Mariupol,” 38-year-old resident Ihar Kazmerchak, a linguistics scholar, told the Associated Press in a phone conversation.

Ukraine is offering its own natural gas storage facilities to keep strategic energy reserves of the EU, Ukrainian energy minister Herman Hlushchenko said. The country can rely on the largest underground storage facilities in Europe, Hlushchenko wrote in a post on Facebook.

The minister also welcomed EU efforts to wean the bloc off Russian gas supplies and buy jointly from other suppliers. Ukraine could contribute to this solidarity and balancing mechanism with its storage facilities, he added.

Clashes continue over Mariupol: Ukrainian, Russian sources

The Russian army is shelling civilian and military sites in the port city of Mariupol from the air and with artillery, the Ukrainian General Staff said in a report. Meanwhile Russian ground forces are trying to advance into the city centre. Oleksiy Arestovych, a senior adviser to Zelenskyy, also referred to street fighting in the southern city.

From the Russian side, Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov published videos allegedly showing the deployment of his fighters in Mariupol.

NATO’s article 5 is ‘sacred commitment’: Biden

The US has a “sacred commitment” to the NATO military alliance’s collective defence, Biden told his Polish counterpart Duda while in Warsaw.

“You can count on that… for your freedom and ours,” he added. Biden’s comment came after Duda said that Poles were feeling a “great sense of threat” due to the ongoing war.

Biden also said he thought Putin “was counting on dividing, be able to separate eastern flank from the west”. However, he said, he had not been able to do so.

New Kyiv curfew from Saturday evening to Monday morning

A fresh curfew will be imposed on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv from Saturday evening until Monday morning, mayor Vitali Klitschko announced.

“The military command decided to reinforce the curfew. It will start from 8:00 pm Saturday and last until 7:00 am on Monday,” he said on Telegram.

He said residents could only “go out to seek shelter if sirens go off” and added that “public transport, shops, pharmacies and petrol pumps will be closed.”

Curfew has been imposed several times in Kyiv since the start of the Russian invasion on February 24. The previous curfew lasted 35 hours between March 21 and 23.

Biden meets top Ukrainian ministers in Warsaw

Joe Biden met in Warsaw with two Ukrainian ministers in the first face-to-face talks between the US president and top Kyiv officials since Russia’s invasion began.

Foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba and defence minister Oleksii Reznikov made a rare trip out of Ukraine in a possible sign of growing confidence in the fightback against Russian forces.

The meeting took place at the Marriott Hotel in the city centre – opposite a Warsaw train station where there has been a constant flow of Ukrainian refugees since the conflict started.

Biden last met Kuleba in Washington on February 22 – two days before Russia began its assault.

Japan’s Kishida sees growing chance of Russia using nuclear weapons

Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said the prospect of Russia using nuclear weapons was “increasingly real”, while welcoming a visit by the United States ambassador to Hiroshima, the first city to suffer a nuclear attack.

Japan, the only country attacked by atomic weapons, has regularly spoken out against nuclear armaments. Kishida, who represents Hiroshima in parliament, visited the city’s peace memorial and museum on Saturday with envoy Rahm Emanuel.

“When the possible use of nuclear weapons by Russia is increasingly real, I believe ambassador Emanuel’s visit to Hiroshima and his experience of seeing the nuclear reality will become a strong message to the international society,” Kishida told public broadcaster NHK.

“I believe our visit was meaningful.”

Putin has not directly threatened a nuclear attack. But he warned that anyone hindering Russia would face “such consequences that you have never encountered in your history” – a statement some leaders took as a threat to use nuclear weapons.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday that Russia would use nuclear weapons only to counter “an existential threat for our country”.

Ukraine president makes surprise appearance at Doha Forum

Ukraine’s Zelenskyy has delivered a virtual address to a forum of more than a dozen world leaders at the annual Doha Forum in Qatar.

Al Jazeera’s Jamal Elshayyal, reporting from Doha, said that Zelenskyy’s address was not announced to be part of the programme, possibly because its organisers wanted to bring in the Russian side.

“Zelenskyy used the opportunity to address over a dozen world leaders participating at the forum to further press them to take stronger action in putting an end to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” Elshayyal said from Doha.

The Ukrainian president asked countries attending to take steps to further isolate Moscow and boycott Russian oil and gas, and urged gas-rich nations like Qatar to step in and fill the void.

“Even if Qatar would want to do something like this, lucrative as it would be, it would be almost impossible to fill the 30 percent of Europe’s energy needs which are currently being supplied by Russia,” Elshayyal said.

Russian defence minister seen speaking at army meeting after long public silence

Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu was seen chairing an army meeting and discussing weapons supplies in a video posted by his ministry, the first time he had publicly been shown speaking for more than two weeks.

In the video, uploaded on social media, Shoigu said he had discussed issues related to the military budget and defence orders with the finance ministry.

“We continue ahead-of-schedule delivery of weaponry and equipment by means of credits. The priorities are long-range high-precision weapons, aircraft equipment and maintenance of engagement readiness of strategic nuclear forces,” said Shoigu, who is overseeing what Russia calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine.

The meeting was attended by a number of top Russian army officials including Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov, who also had not been seen in public recently.

Ukraine says 10 humanitarian corridors agreed for front-line areas

Ukraine has reached an agreement on the establishment of 10 humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians from towns and cities on the front line of the conflict, the deputy prime minister has said.

Speaking on national television, Iryna Vereshchuk said civilians trying to leave the besieged southern port of Mariupol would have to leave in private cars as Russian forces were not letting buses through their checkpoints.

Ukraine and Russia have traded blame when humanitarian corridors have failed to work in recent weeks.

Zelenskyy calls on energy producers to hike output

Ukraine’s president made a surprise video appearance at Qatar’s Doha Forum, calling on energy producing countries to increase output so that Russia cannot use its oil and gas wealth to “blackmail” other nations.

Zelenskyy compared Russia’s destruction of the port city of Mariupol with the Syrian and Russian destruction wrought on the city of Aleppo in the Syrian war.

“They are destroying our ports,” Zelenskyy said. “The absence of exports from Ukraine will deal a blow to countries worldwide.”

Zelenskyy called on countries to increase their exports of energy – something particularly important as Qatar is a world leader in the export of natural gas.

He also noted that Muslims in Ukraine would have to fight during the upcoming holy fasting month of Ramadan.

“We have to ensure this sacred month of Ramadan is not overshadowed by the misery of people in Ukraine,” he said.

Russia conducts military drills on isles disputed with Japan: Reports

Russia was conducting drills on islands claimed by Tokyo, Japanese media reported, days after Moscow halted peace talks with Japan because of its sanctions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Russia’s Eastern Military District said it was conducting military drills on the Kuril Islands with more than 3,000 troops and hundreds of pieces of army equipment, Russia’s Interfax news agency said.

It did not say where on the island chain, connecting Russia’s Kamchatka peninsula and Japan’s northernmost main island of Hokkaido, the drills were taking place.

Japanese media said they were on territory the Soviet Union seized at the end of World War II that is claimed by Tokyo. Japan’s foreign ministry and prime minister’s office could not be reached outside business hours to comment on the exercises.

Russia ‘scaling back’ ambitions in Ukraine: Analyst

Russia is shifting its military goals in Ukraine to focus on fully capturing the eastern region of Donbas because it failed to take Kyiv quickly, Harry Nedelcu, policy director at Rasmussen Global, an international policy consultancy firm, has said.

“Now like a bully that got a bloody nose, Russia is scaling back its ambitions,” Nedelcu told Al Jazeera from Brussels, Belgium.

“It’s bringing this back to a focus on just the territories of the so-called people’s republics in eastern Ukraine, which Putin recognised right before he invaded Ukraine. So this allows Putin to concentrate firepower and resources on war aims which from Moscow’s perspective are more attainable.”

Russian focus on ‘liberating’ Donbas hints at shift in strategy

Russia has claimed that the first phase of its “military operation” in Ukraine was mostly complete and that it would focus on fully “liberating” eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region.

The announcement appeared to indicate that Russia may be switching to more limited goals after running into fierce Ukrainian resistance in the first month of the war.

“The combat potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has been considerably reduced, which … makes it possible to focus our core efforts on achieving the main goal, the liberation of Donbas,” Sergei Rudskoi, head of the Russian General Staff’s Main Operational Directorate, said.

LVIV, Ukraine (AP) — For a month now, Russian forces have repeatedly attacked Ukrainian medical facilities, striking at hospitals, ambulances, medics, patients and even newborns — with at least 34 assaults independently documented by The Associated Press.

With every new attack, the public outcry for war crimes prosecutions against Russian President Vladimir Putin, his generals and top Kremlin advisers grows louder.

To convict, prosecutors will need to show that the attacks are not merely accidents or collateral damage. The emerging pattern, tracked day by day by the AP, shows evidence of a consistent and relentless onslaught against the very civilian infrastructure designed to save lives and provide safe haven to Ukraine’s most vulnerable.

AP journalists in Ukraine have seen the deadly results of Russian strikes on civilian targets first hand: the final moments of children whose tiny bodies were shredded by shrapnel or had limbs blown off; dozens of corpses, including those of children, heaped into mass graves .

“The pattern of attacks will help prosecutors build the case that these are deliberate attacks,” said Ryan Goodman, professor of law at New York University and former special counsel at the U.S. Department of Defense. “Prosecutors will draw inferences from how many medical facilities were targeted, how many times individual facilities were repeatedly struck and in what span of time.”

Deliberate attacks on hospitals will likely be a top priority for war crimes prosecutors.

Aftermath of the Russian airstrike on a maternity hospital in Mariupol, Ukraine.

This accounting of attacks on medical facilities is part of a larger effort by the AP and the PBS series Frontline to track evidence of potential war crimes committed during the one of the largest conflicts in Europe since the end of World War II.

The War Crimes Watch Ukraine project launched by AP and Frontline includes details of apparent targeted attacks as well as indiscriminate destruction of civilian buildings and infrastructure. The AP/Frontline online database will continue to be updated as long as the conflict lasts. The goal is to provide an independent accounting of events, apart from potentially inflated claims by advocates or misinformation spread by state-backed propaganda.

___

This story is part of an ongoing investigation from The Associated Press and Frontline that includes the War Crimes Watch Ukraine interactive experience and an upcoming documentary.

___

The AP’s own reports include strong visual evidence such as photos and videos, along with witness accounts of alleged atrocities. AP journalists outside Ukraine have confirmed the details of other attacks by interviewing survivors and independently verifying the authenticity of videos and photos from the war zone posted online by local officials and residents.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights confirms at least 1,035 civilians, including 90 children, have died in the four weeks since the start of the war. Another 1,650 civilians have been wounded. Those numbers are certainly an undercount since scores of bodies now lie under the rubble of demolished buildings or were hurriedly buried in mass graves, or the deaths occurred in areas now under Russian control.

Still, Russian officials have denied hitting civilian targets, deriding the mounting documentation of atrocities as “Fake News” and claiming without evidence that dead and wounded civilians photographed were “crisis actors.”

Speaking at talks in Turkey about a potential cease-fire, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov dismissed concerns about civilian casualties as “pathetic shrieks” from Russia’s enemies and denied Ukraine has even been invaded.

Military attacks on civilian populations and their property are generally forbidden under international laws governing armed conflicts going back more than a century. Efforts are already underway by the International Criminal Court in the Hague and Ukrainian prosecutors to compile evidence for future criminal indictments.

Chief ICC prosecutor Karim A.A. Khan announced last month that his agency had opened an investigation after receiving referrals from 39 nations over potential evidence of war crimes committed in Ukraine. President Joe Biden has said he believes Putin is a war criminal, and the U.S. government has assessed that members of Russia’s armed forces have committed war crimes.

Attacks on medical facilities and staff are considered particularly heinous under international law, which stipulates they must be protected. Still, bombing a hospital is not necessarily a war crime. Prosecutors must show that the destruction is intentional or reckless.

But the evidence of such attacks in Ukraine verified by AP and Frontline is both mounting and horrendous, and belies Russian claims that they were staged, self-inflicted or militarily justified.

Russia is bombing “medical infrastructure on purpose, fighting sick people as if they were military,” said Pavlo Kovtoniuk, a former deputy minister of health and WHO consultant who co-founded the Ukrainian Healthcare Center, a think tank based in Kyiv that has been documenting attacks on hospitals.

“Bombing hospitals is especially cruel because it shows civilian people that there is no safe place for them on earth,” he said.

Among the most thoroughly documented strikes was the March 9 bombing of a children’s and maternity hospital in Mariupol. Two AP journalists, the last international media to remain in the city after it was encircled by Russian forces, arrived at the hospital minutes after the explosion.

They saw a smoldering two-story deep crater in the interior courtyard, surrounded by the twisted and burned remains of several cars. The force of the explosion tore the facades off three surrounding buildings, blowing out the windows and wrecking rooms inside.

The AP journalists took photos and video of stunned survivors coming out of the hospital. A pregnant woman being carried on a stretcher held her belly, blood staining her sweatpants, her face pale. She later died following an emergency cesarean section at another nearby hospital, according to Dr. Timur Marin, one of the surgeons who tried to save her. The woman’s baby also did not survive.

Another pregnant woman, Mariana Vishegirskaya, her face bloodied, clutched her belongings in a plastic bag and made her way down a set of debris-strewn stairs and out of the ruined hospital.

Vishegirskaya was taken to another nearby hospital, Mariupol Regional Intensive Care, where she gave birth the following day to a baby girl she named Veronika.

“We were lying in wards when glass, frames, windows and walls flew apart,” she told AP, lying next to her newborn.

Ukrainian authorities say three were killed by the airstrike, including a child. Another 17 were wounded.

Kremlin officials admitted Russian aircraft had struck the hospital but insisted all patients and staff had been evacuated prior to the bombing. State media claimed without providing any evidence that the hospital was being used as a base for the Azov Battalion, a small far-right nationalist group often used as casus belli by Putin for false claims that the Ukrainian government is rife with Nazis.

At a U.N. Security Council meeting the day after the strike, Russian ambassador Vassily Nebenzia claimed the wounded pregnant women documented by AP journalists were “crisis actors,” playing the part of victims in an elaborate plot to frame Russia.

On Twitter, the Russian embassy in London posted two AP photos side-by-side, one depicting Vishegirskaya and another of the pregnant woman who died. Each was branded in red as “FAKE.” Twitter removed the tweet for violating its rules against denying violent events.

Vishegirskaya is a blogger in Mariupol who before the war posted about skin care, makeup and cosmetics; there is no evidence that she was anything but a patient at the hospital. She posted multiple photos and videos on Instagram documenting her pregnancy in the past few months.

The AP journalists also saw no evidence that the facility was being used as anything other than a hospital. They saw no military hardware or vehicles among the burned-out wrecks in the courtyard. Hospitals rooms were filled with beds and medical equipment.

The contention that the victims were actors and the hospitals were military targets “is preposterous, and no court of law would give it any credence,” said David Scheffer, who served as U.S. Ambassador at Large for War Crimes Issues during the Clinton administration. ”Imagine them trying to say it in front of a seasoned panel of judges as if it can be credibly believed.”

Scheffer and Goodman both said prosecutors in any future trial are likely to argue multiple strikes against medical facilities are evidence of an intentional strategy to break the morale of the enemy population.

Russian commanders used similar airstrikes during the Syrian war. Physicians for Human Rights, an advocacy group that tracked attacks on medical workers in Syria, documented more than 250 attacks on medical facilities and staff after Russia intervened in the conflict in 2015.

The assaults on medical facilities in Ukraine began with at least two attacks on the very first day of the war.

On Feb. 24, a local media organization posted a photo on Twitter of City Children’s Hospital No. 1 in Donetsk, struck by an artillery shell that damaged its top floor. AP found that the photo matches the pictures of the hospital from before the war; the building is clearly marked as a medical facility on maps of the area.

Another photo posted on Twitter showed a large explosion and fire at Central City Hospital in Vuhledar. AP matched the building in the photo to pre-war images of the hospital in Vuhledar, which is clearly marked as a medical facility on maps.

Угледар попал под обстрел, попали в больницу, есть жертвы среди мирного населения. pic.twitter.com/iR1HijoVoY — Наталка 🕑🕔 (@Volnovakha) February 24, 2022

The advocacy group Human Rights Watch obtained additional photos from the hospital’s chief doctor, Natalia Sosyura, who provided the names of the four civilians who died in the strike. Ten others were reported to have been wounded.

Additional photos published by a Ukrainian media organization showed two burned out vehicles in the hospital’s driveway with two bodies covered by blue sheets. Another photo showed the crumpled nose cone of a rocket.

Chris Weakley, a former U.S. Army explosive ordnance disposal technician and private intelligence analyst, identified the cone as coming from a Russian Tochka ballistic missile, used to carry cluster munitions. As a former Soviet republic, Ukraine’s military also has access to some Russian weapons systems, but there is no evidence Ukraine has been attacking its own hospitals.

In a statement issued March 12, a spokesperson for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva, Liz Throssell, said the agency had received “credible reports of several cases of Russian forces using cluster munitions” and specifically cited the attack on the Vuhledar.

The stockpiling and use of cluster munitions is banned under an international convention signed by 110 countries, but Russia and Ukraine are not among them. However, their use in civilian areas is by definition indiscriminate — a violation of international humanitarian law — since the munition scatters small grenade-sized bomblets over a wide area.

On the second day of the war, three more Ukrainian medical facilities were reported to have been hit, including a children’s hospital and cancer center.

Kharkiv Regional Children’s Clinical Hospital No. 1 also was struck by a cluster bomb munition, wounding one staff member. Photos posted on the hospital’s social media accounts show numerous impact craters on the hospital campus, including one that fell in a playground. One of the photos shows an unexploded bomblet about the size of a soda bottle on the ground near the front entrance. Weakley identified it as a Russian-made 9N235 cluster submunition.

A different video verified by AP shows a series of explosions in a building identified on maps as the oncology department of Melitopol City Hospital No. 1. The building in the video matches pre-war imagery of the hospital, which features a large red cross on the facade.

Statistics for the number of Ukrainian medical facilities damaged since Russia invaded vary widely. The Ukrainian Health Ministry says 248 medical facilities have been damaged, with 13 completely destroyed. The World Health Organization, by contrast, said 57 Ukrainian medical facilities have been damaged, some more than once. The AP and Frontline have only counted those they could independently confirm.

Russian shelling in Lysychansk caused extensive damage to Luhansk Regional Children’s Clinical Hospital in early March. Sergei Haidai, a local government official, said the hospital was hit by at least 10 shells over a two-day period, wounding a surgeon.

AP video from March 11 shows damage to ambulances and buildings at Dergachi Central Hospital, which Mayor Vyacheslav Zadorenko says resulted from Russian attack on his town. That video also shows expended cluster rocket canisters impaled in the ground. Weakley identified them as Russian-made 9M27K cargo rockets, which carry the same bomblets found at the children’s hospital in Kharkiv.

Okhmatdyt Children’s Hospital in Kyiv, which houses Ukraine’s primary pediatric cancer center, has repeatedly been rocked by explosions since the war began. Dr. Serhii Chernyshuk, the hospital’s medical director, said the blasts and shrapnel from Russian missiles and rockets landing nearby have blown out windows and doors.

To try to keep their patients from the ongoing bombardment, Ohmatdyt’s staff moved them into the basement. An AP journalist who visited the facility on Feb. 28 photographed three young cancer patients , their heads bald from chemotherapy. Two held up sheets of notebook paper with a handwritten message in English: “Stop War.”

Chernyshuk said he and his staff have been largely living at the hospital, working long hours on little sleep.

“We must support our patients because, in Kyiv and Ukraine, it’s terrible for everybody,” he said. “But our patients have a different problem, they cannot help themselves. We must do it.”

Yulia Ablamskaya was one of 17 employees inside the Mediland Clinic Kyiv when she says a loud “boom” rocked the building in the early morning hours of March 16. As the chaos unfolded, she hurried to get the three remaining patients at the center to a safer place. The patients, she said, are all awaiting operations and unable to travel.

“We felt the walls of the building shivering,” Ablamskaya, an administrator at the clinic, recounted. “So, we of course jumped up and went to take the patients.”

Once they were safe, she returned to take photos and videos of the damage, which she provided to AP. They show cracked walls and shattered windows.

There’s also evidence Russian forces have intentionally targeted ambulances and medics, including multiple photos posted by Ukrainian health officials showing ambulances riddled with bullet holes.

Video posted online Feb. 26 shows an ambulance is engulfed in flames on a rural road outside Kherson after Ukrainian officials say it was struck by Russian heavy weapons fire. Medics from a second ambulance work feverishly to save a wounded man wearing a red paramedic’s uniform who is on the ground, bleeding from his head. Ukrainian media and government authorities reported the ambulance’s driver, Volodymyr Vasyliovych Kovalchuk, and a patient died in the attack, which appears to match a confirmed incident in the WHO database.

Ukrainian Health Minister Viktor Liashko said in a Facebook post on Wednesday that Russian forces have hit 58 emergency vehicles and killed six medics, forcing the government to outfit emergency medical workers with body armor.

David Crane is a former senior inspector general in the Department of Defense who served as chief prosecutor of a United Nations-sponsored war crimes tribunal over atrocities committed during Sierra Leone’s civil war. What is happening in Ukraine, he said, is worthy of prosecution.

“The bottom line is this is medieval warfare in the Ukraine,” Crane said. “It’s precisely the sort of warfare that the laws of armed conflict were designed to prevent.”
