Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief, made the comparison in a characteristically blunt speech to the European parliament as he urged Europe to send more arms to Ukraine to help end the war.

“We have to continue arming Ukraine. We need less rounds of applause and more assistance,” he said. The EU had pledged €1bn in military aid for Ukraine, he said, which “might seem a lot” but “€1bn is what we pay Putin every day for the energy he provides us. Since the beginning of the war we have given him €35bn. Compare that to the €1bn we have given to Ukraine in arms and weapons.”

He made the comments as the EU debated a fifth round of sanctions against Russia, with a ban on coal imports worth €4bn from the country expected to be announced soon.

EU work on sanctions intensified as officials reacted to reports from Bucha and other Ukrainian towns where civilians have been murdered, tortured, raped and abused.

Poland and the Baltic states argue that the energy ban should also target Russia’s far more lucrative oil and gas exports, but have faced resistance to immediate action from Germany, Austria and Hungary. The EU imports 41% of its gas and 27% of its oil from Russia, but these figures are much higher in some member states.

The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, who is expected to travel to Kyiv with Borrell in the coming days, promised the latest sanctions would not be the last. “Now we have to look into oil and we will have to look into the revenues that Russia gets from fossil fuels.” EU officials, she told MEPs, would study an Estonian idea under which payments for Russian gas would be put in an escrow account, ie in the hands of a third party, with the aim of limiting revenues to the Russian state that could fund the war effort.

""[Ukrainian President] Zelenskyy needs us to tell him less often that he is a hero and give him more weapons to fight.That's what Ukrainians expect from us and that's what we're doing; and we must do it faster. Putting pressure on Russia and arming Ukraine. Help them to combat the invading forces with all the capabilities at our disposal,"" Borrell told the European Parliament on Wednesday.

""We've given Ukraine nearly €1 billion. That might seem like a lot but €1 billion is what we're paying [Vladimir] Putin every day for the energy he provides us with. Since the start of the war, we've given him €35 billion, compared to the €1 billion we've given Ukraine to arm itself.""

The EU's heavy dependency on Russian oil, gas and coal has been laid bare by the war in Ukraine.

A growing chorus of voices is calling on the bloc to implement a total embargo on Russian fossil fuels, which last year amounted to over €99 billion and are credited with funding the Kremlin's war machine.

But the issue has become highly divisive among member states, who have different energy mixes and are therefore unequally exposed to the consequences from a cut-off. While Poland and the Baltic states say the move is a moral duty for the EU, German businesses have warned of a ""steep recession"" if a complete embargo is introduced.

The debate has reached a new level of intensity after reports emerged of indiscriminate killings against civilians in Bucha, a suburb close to Kyiv.

A new package of sanctions unveiled by the European Commission on Tuesday afternoon proposed a ban on imports of Russian coal, which represent around €4 billion and are the easiest supply to replace.

""Today we put an end to coal, but that's a very small fraction of the total bill,"" said Borrell.

""Our independence, our energy autonomy, is contingent upon renewable energy and, for the first time, geopolitics and climate change shake hands in a common goal.""

The Commission has said it will work on measures related to oil, for which the EU pays over €70 billion annually, but made no mention of gas, on which the bloc spends more than €16 billion.

The latest measures are now being discussed by the 27 member states, who need to approve them by unanimity.",https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2022/04/06/eu-has-spent-35bn-on-russian-energy-and-just-1bn-on-aid-borrell

The EU paid Moscow €35 billion, Josep Borrell told the European Parliament, compared to just €1 billion in aid for arms to Kyiv.

While he said the money for arms for Ukraine “might seem a lot”, he added: “€1 billion is what we pay Putin every day for the energy he provides us.”

Britain has announced that it will end all dependency on Russian coal and oil by the end of the year, and gas imports “as soon as possible” afterwards.

Liz Truss, the Foreign Secretary, urged European and G7 allies to agree to a timetable to end all imports of Kremlin-controlled fossil fuels.

As Nato and G7 foreign ministers met in Brussels, she warned that Britain would never normalise relations with Moscow until its leaders faced justice for suspected war crimes in Ukraine.

Writing exclusively for The Telegraph, Ms Truss said: “If and when we do engage, it will be on our terms. Our starting point will be our resilience, defence and deterrence, and that Russia faces justice for its heinous crimes.

“Now is the time to be strong to ensure we see off Putin’s aggression for good. We must go further to cripple Putin’s war machine through sanctions.”",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/04/06/eu-spends-35-times-russian-energy-weapons-ukraine/

Europe has actually bought more fuel from Russia since Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine back in February, despite pledging to punish the Kremlin’s aggression.

On Tuesday, the amount of gas mainland Europe bought from Russia (in shipments going via Ukraine) hit a four-month high – the EU currently to import 41% of its gas from the country and 27% of its oil.

While prime minister Boris Johnson did previously warn there would be a transition period before Europe is able to wean itself off Russian supplies, the trade leaves the West open to accusations it is undermining its own attempts to punish Moscow through sanctions.

As Bloomberg’s energy columnist Javier Blas said: “Europe’s current energy policy isn’t sustainable. It’s hypocritical, and leaves the region at the mercy of Moscow. The alternative isn’t pretty, but Europe needs to prepare for it.”

Will it change any time soon?

Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign affairs chief, did openly admit that Europe’s approach was probably helping Putin’s war effort on Tuesday, and called for immediate change.

He told the European Parliament: “We have given Ukraine €1 billion [£0.83 billion]. It might seem a lot, but €1 billion is what we pay Putin every day for the energy he provides us.

“Since the beginning of the war, we have given him €35 billion [£29 billion], compared to the €1 billion we have given Ukraine in arms and weapons.”

He added: “Each day, roughly, we are paying €1 billion to import Russian energy, and that’s, obviously, a source of income that’s used to finance the war.”

Borrell called for the EU to “cut the umbilical cord”, and wanted more money handed to Ukraine through weapons.

He said: “When it comes to oil and gas, we are paying the equivalent of the amount of assets that have been frozen owned by the Russian central bank. So, the first thing that we need to do is to cut the umbilical cord. We need to stop these flows that allow them to gain assets to finance this war.”

Story continues

The EU chief claimed the bloc will “have cut our dependence on Russian energy by two-thirds” by the end of the year, adding: “Everybody needs to make an individual effort when it comes to cutting use.”

The EU is actually expected to announce an embargo on Russian coal soon – worth an estimated £3.3 billion) although it remains to be seen if the bloc will follow this up with a ban on oil and gas.

The UK and the US have already announced a ban on Russian oil imports.

Each day, roughly, we are paying €1 billion to import Russian energy, and that’s, obviously, a source of income that’s used to finance the war.Josep Borrell, EU foreign affairs chief

What’s the hold-up?

Germany, Austria and Hungary have all resisted any changes to Europe’s energy strategy.

Last month, Germany’s chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a statement: “Europe has deliberately exempted energy supplies from Russia from sanctions.

“At the moment, Europe’s supply of energy for heat generation, mobility, power supply and industry cannot be secured in any other way. It is therefore of essential importance for the provision of public services and the daily lives of our citizens.”

Europe also puts gas into storage in April in preparation for the following winter, but to do so efficiently for this year, it would need to keep buying from Russia.

Russian gas only makes up a small portion of the UK’s total supplies, but the UK market is closely aligned with Europe, meaning if gas prices climb once again there, they’ll do the same here.

In March, the prime minister said: “There are different dependencies in different countries, we have to be mindful of that.

“You can’t simply close down use of oil and gas overnight, even from Russia. That’s obviously not something every country around the world can do.”

He added: “We need to do is make sure we’re all moving in the same direction, all share the same assumptions, that we accelerate that movement.”

The text was adopted by an overwhelming majority of 513 votes against 22 with 19 abstentions. And although such resolutions are non-binding, they can ramp up pressure on member states.

Student or retired? Then this plan is for you.

The EU is paying Russia about €800m each day for the supply of fossil fuels, according to centre-right MEP Siegfried Muresan who said a total embargo was necessary to stop financing the war in Ukraine.

During a plenary debate on Wednesday, the EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell also said Europe has paid about €35bn to Russia for energy supplies since the start of the war, compared to the €1bn the bloc had given to Ukraine to arm itself.

A full embargo would have to go hand-in-hand with a proposal from the European Commission to ensure the EU's security of energy supply, MEPs said.

They also called on EU countries to step up the delivery of weapons to Ukraine and to exclude Russia from the G20 and other international organisations such as Interpol, the World Trade Organization, and Unesco.

With the fifth package of sanctions against Moscow expected on Friday, pressure is mounting on the EU to halt imports of Russian energy.

Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba also urged the EU to impose a full oil and gas embargo during an address in a Nato session on Thursday.

But the EU's sanctions regime requires unanimity and several member states have voiced scepticism about imposing a full embargo on Russian energy.

Hungary's recently re-elected prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has repeatedly said his country will block any sanctions targeting oil or gas.

The two fossil fuels remain Moscow's main sources of foreign income.

For the moment, the EU is only expected to announce a ban on coal imports worth an estimated €4bn per year.

But an oil embargo is gaining support to be potentially included in the next round of sanctions, an EU diplomat told EUobserver.

Russia is the world's second-largest exporter of crude oil, after Saudi Arabia, and the biggest supplier to the EU.

Germany, the Netherlands and Poland are the top buyers of Russian crude oil, according to the International Energy Agency, an intergovernmental body in Paris.

Russia has extensive infrastructure to ship oil to Europe and Asia.

But those EU countries connected to the so-called Druzhba pipeline system are especially dependent on Russian crude oil. These include Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Germany.

What would oil embargo mean?

Experts said an oil embargo could push inflation for producers and consumers even higher.

If EU refiners cannot purchase Russian cargoes, they would be forced to bid elsewhere for supply, and ""that will raise the prices they pay or reduce the amount of oil available to them,"" George Pearkes, an investment analyst at Bespoke Investment Group, told EUobserver.

But Pearkes pointed out that purchases of Russian crude cargoes have already slowed substantially given the lack of interest from buyers who do not want to accidentally face future sanctions or logistics problems.

For his part, Nick Sitter, a professor at the Central European University and BI Norwegian Business School, said the EU is much more likely to go for an oil embargo than a gas cut-off.

This would be part of ""a response to further Russian escalation or further revelations of war crimes,"" he said.

Macron and Draghi

Earlier this week, French president Emmanuel Macron made a link between the oil embargo and the reports of war crimes in Bucha.

Russia is the world's second-largest producer of natural gas, behind the United States. In Europe, Germany and Italy are the largest importers of Russian gas.

Italian prime minister Mario Draghi told a press conference on Wednesday that a gas embargo was not on the table. ""I don't know if it ever will be,"" he said.",https://euobserver.com/world/154694

Fresh sanctions were levied against Russia by the UK and the US on Wednesday targeting banking infrastructure, the energy industry and even Vladimir Putin’s daughters.

But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has dismissed the sanctions as “not enough” and said these had failed to match “the evil” seen in Bucha and Mariupol.

It came as his foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba urged Nato allies to supply Ukraine with “weapons, weapons and more weapons.”

Speaking in his nightly address, President Zelensky said: “Today, Western countries announced a new package of sanctions against the Russian Federation. This package looks good. But this is not enough.

“Still it can hardly be called commensurate with the evil that the world saw in Bucha. With the evil that continues in Mariupol, in the shelling of Kharkiv, in Russia’s attempt to launch a new global bloody offensive in Donbas.”

The EU is still thrashing out its latest sanctions package, which is expected to be finalised on Thursday.

For weeks, Ukraine has pleaded with its allies to bolster support for the country militarily. Most recently the country’s foreign minister Kuleba called on Nato to provide war planes, heavy air defence systems, missiles and armoured vehicles.

He criticised countries that were making the distinction between offensive and defensive weapons. Many nations, including France, have been reluctant to provide Ukraine with weapons such as tanks over fears Russia would see it as a direct provocation and involvement in the war.

Here i takes a look at what each Western nation is doing to support Ukraine and to punish Russia – and what President Zelensky thinks about his allies.

The UK

President Zelensky has already lauded Boris Johnson’s readiness to support Ukraine, especially in the form of military support.

He previously remarked that “Britain is definitely on our side” and added that “Johnson is a leader who is helping more” than other nations.

The UK has already supplied extensive defensive weapons to Ukraine, recently sending a shipment of Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles.

British military chiefs are now drawing up plans to send armoured vehicles to Ukraine, The Times reports.

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) believes the next three weeks will be critical, and are considering sending more lethal weapons to help enable Ukrainian forces to push further towards Russian lines.

Further military support will be seen in the form of anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, a source told the newspaper.

Officials are also expected to announce the deployment of more British troops to nations neighbouring Ukraine to carry out training.

Speaking on Wednesday at Nato’s headquarters, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: “In the face of Putin’s appalling aggression in Ukraine the G7 and Nato are stepping up our efforts on sanctions and on weapons.

“The UK is now banning all imports of Russian energy, we are sanctioning more banks and we are stepping up our supply of weapons to Ukraine.”

Germany, Austria and Hungary

President Zelensky has appeared to group these nations together and issued a damning assessment of their political leadership.

In his latest address, the Ukrainian president called out Western leaders who are pushing back against a Russian oil ban.

The nations leading the charge are Germany, Austria and Hungary, though President Zelensky did not outright name them.

“Some politicians are still unable to decide how to limit the flow of dollars and euros from the oil trade to Russia, so as not to jeopardise their own economies,” he said.

“But that’s why people go into politics. To solve such problems, such difficult tasks. To solve them quickly and in a principled fashion.”

In a damning indictment aimed at Hungary’s Viktor Orban, Germany’s Olaf Scholz and Austria’s Karl Nehammer, he added: “If you are not capable then you shouldn’t have entered politics.”

The three nations are resisting an outright embargo as they are highly dependent on the imports.

They fear that cutting off Russian gas risks wiping out growth in Europe’s biggest economies, sending energy prices to record highs and triggering an inflationary shockwave through the global economy.

The German Economy Minister Robert Habeck has said a sudden import ban on energy would harm the EU more than Russia.

President Zelensky previously accused Germany of “making a mistake” by sitting on the fence and failing to take a firm stance against Mr Putin over economic fears.

Austria has also spoken out against sanctions on Russian fuel.

Magnus Brunner, Austria’s federal minister for finance, told CNBC: “Austria is not in favour of more sanctions concerning gas. We are very much dependent on the Russian gas and I think all sanctions which hit us more than the Russians wouldn’t be good for us. That is why we are against sanctions in oil and gas.”

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has noted that the bloc has given Russia €35bn (£29.2bn) in energy payments since the start of the war but has given Ukraine just €1bn (£834m) in arms and weapons.

But as EU nations, the trio have backed the previous four packages of sanctions against Russia that target banks, oligarchs and key industries. They are also set to back the bloc’s latest round of sanctions.

US

President Zelensky has given a mixed assessment of the US response to the Russian invasion.

On Wednesday, he welcomed the news from the US Treasury that it will cut off Russia’s ability to make debt payments using dollars held at US banks.

“It is good that the US Treasury has suspended Russia’s ability to use US bank accounts and related assets to pay its debt,” the Ukrainian leader said.

On Wednesday, President Biden also unveiled a new package of sanctions, which took aim at Putin’s inner circle, including his daughters.

Severe sanctions were also levied against Russia’s largest private bank, Alfa Bank, and its largest financial institution, Sberbank.

Further punitive measures were taken on critical major state-owned enterprises and a number of Russian government officials and their family members.

So far over 1,000 Russian individuals and businesses have also been subject to sanctions by the US.

Czech Republic

The European nation has reportedly become the first Nato member to supply Ukraine with heavily armoured vehicles.

Prague is understood to have sent a train carrying five T-72 tanks, five BVP-1 infantry fighting vehicles and howitzer artillery pieces.

The decision to supply tanks to Kyiv will pile pressure on other Nato allies to follow suit.

It comes after President Zelensky has been urging the West for weeks to send tanks and planes to help his country fight against Russian troops.

Ireland

President Zelensky has previously heaped praise on Ireland’s repsonse to the war and said the country “was one of the first to come to our aid after February 24” when Russian forces invaded Ukraine.

He added that Ireland “is one of those who shows principled leadership in the European house to put effective and decisive pressure on Russia”.

The comments come after he addressed the Irish parliament on Wednesday and after this he concluded: “Ireland fully supports Ukraine’s accelerated accession to the European Union.”

France

Mr Zelensky appears to have toned down his criticism of Emmanuel Macron, having previously accused the French leader of being “afraid of Russia”.

The Ukrainian leader previously lashed out at Mr Macron for failing to support his country militarily. Mr Macron has resisted calls to send offensive weapons such as tanks to Ukraine saying it could cross “a red line” and draw Nato directly into the conflict.

France has however sent defensive miliatry equipment to Ukraine.

President Macron has also been vocal in calling for tougher sanctions targeting Russian energy this week.

After supporting an embargo on Russian oil and coal, the French leader said he would speak with Germany to co-ordinate a response on Russian fuel.

The nation also joined Germany in expelling Russian diplomats.

European Union

The EU has led a coordinated response to the Ukraine invasion and is expected to levy its fifth round of sanctions against Russia today.

European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen has unveiled plans to impose a fifth wave of sanctions on Russia, which includes:

A ban on coal imports worth €4bn (£3.3bn) a year

A full ban on four Russian banks, including Russia’s second biggest bank VTB

A ban on Russian ships entering EU ports (with some exemptions) and on Russian road transport operators

Bans on EU exports of some tech and machinery including advanced semiconductors, and on imports on Russian alcohol, seafood, and wood

Russian companies would also be barred from taking part in competing for contracts across the EU

You can be fairly certain the Kremlin will trot out the same narrative it has in response to previous sanctions - that the West is looking for any excuse to sanction Russia.

Vladimir Putin said last week the West has been waging an economic war against Russia for years in order to undermine its development.

He is trying to tell the Russian people they are, in effect, the victims here and there is no causal relationship to what's happening in Ukraine.

In his words, Western sanctions are the price Russia must pay for freedom and independence.

The Kremlin's narrative is that this is not a war - it's a special military operation designed to defend the interests of Russian-speaking people living in the east of Ukraine.

But increasingly the Kremlin is portraying Ukraine as the real aggressor.

It is trying, Russians are told, to acquire nuclear weapons, it's trying to develop biological ones, there's evidence, people here are told, that Ukraine wants to try and use those kinds of weapons against Russia.

Regarding the footage out of Bucha, some Russians are seeing that, but they're being told that it's fake news.

It's very difficult to get access to any other sources of information, even social media channels - many of them have been blocked here.

And so many Russians believe what they're being told.",https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-60991746/page/7
