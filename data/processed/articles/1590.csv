A Russian tank commander was killed in the attack in the town of Brovary, the Ukrainian military claimed.

The footage, taken from a Ukrainian drone, shows three Russian tanks in the village of Skybyn before they are joined from the north by at least 20 Russian vehicles, including tanks and a TOS-1A, the thermobaric missile launcher system Russia recently confirmed it had used in Ukraine.

The vehicles turn and stop on the north side of the village before artillery shells and rockets begin to explode around them.

The closely grouped tanks appear to be thrown into disarray by the attack, eventually turning to retreat from the town.

A military expert, Air Marshal Philip Osborn, said the grouping of the vehicles suggests they did not anticipate an attack.

""In regards to grouping, you would only group in that way if you felt relatively secure from attack,"" he told Sky News. ""This video proves that was a misjudgement.""

Russian tank commander 'killed'

Intercepted radio communication in audio released alongside the video says they have been ""ambushed"" as multiple strikes hit the column.

Footage shows somebody down on the floor as others rush to help.

The thermobaric missile launcher can be seen to fire, though it is unclear if that was on purpose.

Ukrainian forces claimed a Russian tank commander, Colonel Andrei Zakharov, was killed during the assault.

'Questionable tactics'

The Ukrainian Ministry of Defence said the Russian forces ""suffered significant losses in personnel and equipment"" and the tank column was forced to retreat and go on the defensive.

Rob Lee, a military expert and senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, told Sky News: ""The Russian forces in the video demonstrated some questionable tactics.

""They are quite close to Kyiv and moving on a likely avenue of approach, where the Ukrainians would expect them to come from, and yet the column isn't dispersed at all, leaving them vulnerable to artillery fire.""

An explosion rocked Zagreb (Croatia) at around 23:00 local time on March 11, 2022, triggering fear among the population. The emergency services then found a crater 3 m wide and 1 m deep with the remains of a ‚Äúpilotless military aircraft‚Äù, with some witnesses stating that it was a plane that crashed after the crew ejected and parachuted down to safety.

A press release from Croatia‚Äôs presidential office quotes President Zoran Milanovic stating the aircraft entered Croatian airspace after flying undetected over Hungary for over 40 minutes. The drone then flew less than seven minutes in the Croatian air space, and crashed in the Jarun neighbourhood. The statement continued saying that the drone flew in from Ukraine flying at over 500 knots and at 1,300 meters (about 4,000 feet) of altitude.

According to the first investigation reports released from Croatia, the drone lost the control signal and flew until it ran out of fuel. Meanwhile, Hungarian sources said it arrived in their airspace via Romania, again without being detected by air defenses. The event is being treated as a serious incident and Croatia launched an investigation to try to understand how an old Soviet-era drone was able to fly undetected through NATO airspace.

The War Zone‚Äôs Tyler Rogoway, after close examination of the visual evidence, strongly believes this drone was actually a Tu-141 ‚ÄúStrizh‚Äù reconnaissance drone that must have severely malfunctioned. Nobody knows if it was launched by Ukraine or Russia at this time, but some accounts state it had Russian red stars on it. Even more confusion is added to the mix by sources from the Ukrainian military which said the drone did not belong to them.

The Tupolev Tu-141 Strizh is a Soviet reconnaissance drone that historically served with the Soviet Red Army during the late 1970s and 1980s, before being retired in the early 1990s. In 2014, Ukraine ‚Äúresurrected‚Äù the drone after the invasion of Crimea, since large stocks of it remained in its territory following the fall of the Soviet Union.

Some Tu-141s were reportedly operated during these last two weeks, with at least one while being shot down as seen in photos on social medias. Again, it is not possible to verify who is really operating the drones, as some sources mentioned the presence of the ‚ÄúZ‚Äù symbol which was seen on many vehicles since the beginning of the invasion.

#Ukraine: We have managed to identifiy new wreckage, and can confirm a Ukrainian drone was shot down! However, it‚Äôs not the TB-2, but the Cold war era Tupolev Tu-141 reconnaissance drone; note the landing gear/KR-17A engine.

The Tu-141 is a relatively large, medium-range reconnaissance drone, designed to undertake reconnaissance missions several kilometers behind the front lines at transonic speeds. Among its payloads, it can carry a range of film cameras, infrared imagers, EO imagers, and imaging radar. Some of these payloads are reportedly shared with the recon variant of the Su-24 Fencer.

As with previous Tupolev designs, the Tu-141 has a dart-like rear-mounted delta wing, forward-mounted canards, and a KR-17A turbojet engine mounted above the tail. It is launched from a trailer using a solid-propellant booster and lands with the aid of a tail-mounted parachute and retro rockets, which could explain the reports about the drone being shot down and the parachutes found on the scene.

In 2014, a Ukrainian Tu-143 Reys, a type of drone developed from Tu-141 but smaller and with a shorter operational range than the Strizh, was recovered, almost intact, by pro-Russia separatists in a field in Ukraine.

Update

It looks like that contrary to the initial Croatian press release, both Romania and Hungary detected the drone.

2,0f71b4a1-9efc-4ac4-a121-6bcf6359cca0,['Defense Brief Editorial'],2022-03-13,"Croatian authorities revealed that the Soviet-era Tu-141 Strizh drone that crashed in the country‚Äôs capital late Thursday carried a bomb that weighed up to 120 kilograms.

This was revealed on Sunday as the majority of the wreck was pulled out of a crater that resulted from the aircraft‚Äôs impact. It was said that the bomb exploded only after penetrating the soft ground where it crashed, a coincidence that allegedly prevented more significant damages from the blast.

A damaged black box from inside the aircraft was also recovered, the authorities said, adding that experts are currently working on extracting as much information as possible.

The drone entered Croatian airspace from east to west, or from Hungarian airspace, at a speed of 700 kilometers per hour at an altitude of 1,300 meters. The Romanian defense ministry said that the drone entered its airspace from Ukraine at approximately 23:23 and spend three minutes in its airspace. It crashed in Zagreb after seven minutes in Croatian airspace.

Croatia confirmed the aircraft‚Äôs Soviet origin but did not say whether it was Ukrainian or Russian. Both Ukraine and Russia have already denied involvement in the event.

It is worth noting that Russian news agency Tass reported that a Tu-141 drone also crashed in Crimea a day after the crash in Croatia. The one that was discovered in Crimea reportedly featured a Soviet red star on its wings.

As Croatia continues its investigation, its defense ministry emphasized it would insist on intensifying cooperation within NATO so that such an event would not happen again.

‚ÄúOnce again, we are telling the citizens that they should not worry. What we expect is better communication among NATO members because this could have happened to anyone. That is why we will raise this issue at all levels ‚Äì both political and military,‚Äù the country‚Äôs defense minister Mario Bano≈æiƒá told reporters on Saturday.",https://defbrief.com/2022/03/13/soviet-tu-141-drone-that-crashed-in-croatia-carried-120kg-bomb/

4,0f71b4a1-9efc-4ac4-a121-6bcf6359cca0,['Thomas O Falk'],2022-03-11,"Ankara, which has good relations with both Moscow and Kyiv, has sold dozens of its combat drones to Ukraine since 2019.

During Russia‚Äôs war on Ukraine, video footage has circulated on the internet showing the Turkish combat drone Bayraktar TB2 successfully striking the Russian army.

But as so often during heightened conflicts, it is hard to distinguish between factual events and misinformation ‚Äì some videos of the drone attacks have already been exposed as the latter.

Given the chaotic events on the ground, it is almost impossible to assess how often and how successfully Ukraine has utilised its Turkish drones so far, Mauro Gilli, senior researcher in military technology and international security at ETH Zurich, told Al Jazeera.

‚ÄúThere have been some video footages allegedly showing the employment of the TB2. Of course, information at this point is fragmented, and it needs to be taken with caution.

‚ÄúWe do know that Ukraine bought some TB2 over the past years and that Turkey and Ukraine signed an agreement for the production within Ukrainian borders of the TB2 ‚Äì but, as far as I know, production had not started yet.

‚ÄúAllegedly, some transport aircraft delivered some drones shortly before the beginning of the hostilities with Russia,‚Äù Gilli said.

Since 2019, Kyiv has bought dozens of drones from Ankara.

They have also been used in Libya and in last year‚Äôs battle between Azerbaijan and Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh ‚Äì when the drones were used by Turkey‚Äôs ally Baku.

‚ÄúThe TB2 produced by the company Bayraktar is one of the two prominent armed drones produced by Turkey [the other being the Anka produced by Turkish Aerospace Industry]. It is cheaper than other Western models, but it has a good performance in key parameters [range, altitude as well as sensors and communication system],‚Äù Gilli said.

But given Russia‚Äôs strength of forces, what impact drones might have in Ukraine?

‚ÄúIt will very well depend on Russian air defences. Drones like the TB2 are vulnerable to anti-air defence systems. To be effective, they need to be employed in a savvy way, in coordination with other electronic warfare systems that ‚Äòblind‚Äô enemy radars and through appropriate tactics,‚Äù Gilli said.

‚ÄúHowever, against capable enemies, these technologies and tactics might not be sufficient. In Libya, Russian forces figured out effective ways to counter Turkish tactics and shoot down their drones. The same [has been] observed in Syria and Nagorno-Karabakh,‚Äù he added.

‚ÄúThat Ukraine could strike some Russian ground forces with TB2 suggests either that Russian forces are advancing without air defence ‚Äì which is very well possible, in light of the logistical and organisational problems Russia has encountered so far. Or that Ukrainian forces acquired also advanced electronic warfare systems. Whether they will have a systematic effect on the outcome of the war, it‚Äôs hard to say, but I tend to be sceptical,‚Äù said Gilli.

Regardless of their impact, the use of drones inevitably raises Turkey‚Äôs profile.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has maintained amicable relations with Russia and Ukraine for years, but Moscow‚Äôs invasion has complicated his balancing act.

‚ÄúTurkey and Ukraine were enjoying good and friendly relations before the war,‚Äù Erdi Ozturk, associate professor in politics and international relations at London Metropolitan University, told Al Jazeera.

‚ÄúTurkey has strongly supported Ukrainian independence in the 1990s. After its independence, they worked closely to establish a stable environment in the Black Sea [through] economic and military cooperation,‚Äù he said.

As far as Ankara is concerned, Russia is unlikely to change this dynamic.

‚ÄúTurkey has been playing an active role with its drones, and eight trucks of humanitarian aid have been delivered to local authorities in Ukraine and neighbouring Moldova. Furthermore, in an hourlong call with Moscow [last] Sunday, Erdogan appealed for an urgent general ceasefire,‚Äù said Ozturk.

However, Erdogan still has to be cautious. He cannot afford to favour either side, as this would have severe security and economic consequences.

‚ÄúOn the fifth day of Moscow‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine, Erdogan, one more time, repeated that Turkey could not abandon its ties with Russia or Ukraine,‚Äù Ozturk said.

‚ÄúTurkey is still trying to perpetuate the balance-based policy, which does not mean that Turkey has been establishing its policies without a dilemma. Instead, Turkey has been in a stuck position between Russia and the West regarding security, economy, and energy,‚Äù Ozturk noted.

But while Russia is facing off Turkish drones in Ukraine, the Ankara-Moscow relationship is unlikely to suffer, Cristian Nitoiu, lecturer in diplomacy and international governance at Loughborough University London, told Al Jazeera.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure there have been informal discussions between Erdogan and Putin on potential military support from Turkey to Ukraine, including the supply of drones,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúAnkara has a dualistic approach, criticising Russia for violating Ukraine‚Äôs territorial integrity and expressing its support for the Tatar community in Crimea. Turkey also closed the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits to warships, a move which favours Russia, as it does not allow NATO warships to enter the Black Sea in order to aid Ukraine,‚Äù Nitoiu said.

Furthermore, following the shooting of the Russian aircraft in 2015 by the Turkish air force, the two nations have developed early warning strategies and methods for managing potential military tensions.

‚ÄúIt is likely that Erdogan will inform or even consult Putin before sending military support to Ukraine,‚Äù Nitoiu added.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/11/turkey-drones-use-ukraine

Born two months premature to American parents, the twins were moved from Kyiv to Poland in a rescue evacuation on Monday.

On the day Russia invaded Ukraine, Max and his wife drove from their home in Germany to Poland, and then crossed the border into Ukraine. With fear, they moved in the opposite direction of the long line of cars that intended to flee the country and that was snarling the roads for miles.

Traveling diagonally across the country on Feb. 24, they encountered unmistakable signs of possible violence to come, from dozens of Ukrainian military checkpoints, tanks patrolling the roads and sandbags piled high on the street.

Not venturing to the country would have broken the couple‚Äôs decade-old dream to have a family. Their Ukrainian surrogate mother was soon expected to give birth to their twin daughters.

‚ÄúJust our children not being with us was something we couldn‚Äôt live with,‚Äù Max said.

Now when his daughters smile at him, the war fades away. They were born prematurely on March 4. But he knows that any day, war could be coming closer to his family. Air raid sirens sound day and night, and much of the twins‚Äô first days in the world have been spent in the hospital‚Äôs underground shelter.

Max said he didn‚Äôt know if, when and how his new family of four would be able to return home to safety. He spoke on the condition that his last name not be used because many of his relatives did not know he and his wife had turned to surrogacy.

The Russian war in Ukraine has devastated cities and killed more than 500 Ukrainian civilians, with no end to the fighting in sight. The war has also engulfed the lives of foreign couples seeking to become parents. Nearly every day, Ukrainian surrogates give birth to the children of foreign couples, and these parents are struggling to evacuate their children or even meet them for the first time.

Commercial surrogacy is legal in Ukraine for heterosexual married couples who are medically unable to have children or who have unsuccessfully tried to become pregnant several times using in vitro fertilization. The country‚Äôs favorable laws ‚Äî biological parents are listed on the baby‚Äôs birth certificate ‚Äî and affordable prices, generally around $40,000, have attracted many aspiring parents.

Most parents visit Kyiv, the capital, once before their child‚Äôs birth, to visit agencies, potentially undergo in vitro fertilization and sign a surrogacy contract. Then, the process of a surrogate becoming pregnant may take multiple attempts over years.

At least a dozen companies offer surrogacy in Ukraine, and BioTexCom, one of the leading agencies in Kyiv, estimates that it arranges at least a thousand births each year. The agency had expected to have 100 babies born by month‚Äôs end. Many of these newborns will be born in Kyiv, where fighting has neared hospitals, far from the parents who wait anxiously from outside Ukraine‚Äôs borders to take them home.

Sam Everingham, the founder of Growing Families, a nonprofit based in Australia that supports people navigating surrogacy, said that he had heard from about 90 panicked couples with newborns or babies soon expected in Ukraine. Surrogacy agencies, many of them based in Kyiv, once courted parents with images of chubby-cheeked babies and sonograms. Now, the agencies‚Äô social media pages are filled with grim updates of the staff members‚Äô upended lives and their attempts to keep surrogates and newborns safe in bleak shelters.

Some agencies, like New Hope Surrogacy, have relocated pregnant surrogates to safer regions of the country, or outside of it altogether. However, if these women give birth in neighboring countries with different laws about paid surrogacy, the biological parents‚Äô rights could be jeopardized.

The number of stranded babies is growing. Denis Herman, BioTexCom‚Äôs legal adviser, said the agency was caring for 30 newborns, most of them in Kyiv.

‚ÄúWe have a lot of babies born during this time,‚Äù Mr. Herman said. ‚ÄúWe cannot stop this process. We have to find some ways to deal with it.‚Äù

BioTexCom believes that the babies are safer in the bomb shelters in Kyiv than being transferred in haste, Mr. Herman said.

Mr. Everingham has heard about ‚Äúan ongoing flow‚Äù of parents traveling into Ukraine despite the risk.

Televised scenes of Russian strikes have terrified parents, including a new Canadian father who spoke on the condition of anonymity because his religion forbade surrogacy. His son was born in Kyiv shortly before the war began. He and his wife are in Turkey, trying to figure out a plan to extract their son, mired by deep stress and depression as they follow the news.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to do and where to go,‚Äù said the 41-year-old man, who lives in Toronto. ‚ÄúThe joy of our child has taken over by the fear we might never get to hold him and lose him forever.‚Äù

The parents who have managed to extract their children through a combination of luck, connections and timing, say they feel immense responsibility to help evacuate their surrogates and others left behind in Ukraine.

Sasha Spektor, who lives in Chicago with his partner, Irma Nu√±ez, met his twin boys, Lenny and Moishe, for the first time on Tuesday. His sons had just traveled from Kyiv to Poland, a journey that took about 18 hours.

They were born two months prematurely in Kyiv at the beginning of war, on Feb. 25. The couple, their friends and supporters made hundreds of calls to locate resources in Kyiv, like baby formula and medical equipment, and to find the twins a way out of the war zone. The couple previously told their story of bringing their sons to safety to The Washington Post and NPR.

Eventually, they were able to secure an evacuation with the help of a volunteer Ukrainian ambulance crew and Project Dynamo, a nonprofit based in Tampa, Fla., conducting rescue missions out of Ukraine.

Meeting their sons was amazing, the new father said, adding that they were so gentle, and so tiny.

Their surrogate, Katya, crossed into Poland with the twins and another baby and its parents. Several days later, she returned to Ukraine, to reunite with her 6-year-old son in Lviv with the hopes of fleeing the country together.

‚ÄúThere are other people I feel responsible for,‚Äù Mr. Spektor said. ‚ÄúIt was just as hard for me to part with her and just let her go back into Ukraine. She is one of us.‚Äù",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/03/11/world/ukraine-russia-news

Just ran a test with a mission for the TU-141 coming out of an area around Novobarovo, Ukraine and heading southwest towards Zagreb, Croatia. Altitude is 12k meters and speed 480 knots. It spends a few minutes over Romania but the bulk of its flight is over Hungary. I placed a Patriot battery in Hungary along the flight path. The Patriot detects the TU-141 at around 90 nm. But it never IDs it. On a one way mission, it runs out of fuel just past Zagreb and crashes.



According to news reports, NATO actually detected the flight, but listed it as non-threat. Not sure if that was the right or not. But the test I ran matches the flight path I would have expected.
