CNN footage showed Russian airborne troops on the ground as they engaged Ukrainian troops.

The airport's role as a cargo center and proximity to the capital could aid Russia's offensive.

Ukrainian and Russian forces have been fighting for hours over a critical airfield on the outskirts of Kyiv, Ukraine's capital.

Russian forces attacked and seized the Hostomel (Gostomel) airfield, a cargo airport near Kyiv that is also known as Antonov Airport, early Thursday, according to Agence France-Presse. Ukraine's leadership vowed to take it back, AFP added.

""The enemy paratroopers in Hostomel have been blocked, and troops have received an order to destroy them,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address.

Hostomel is in the northwestern suburbs of Kyiv, which could make it critical to the defense of the Ukrainian capital. Control of the strategic airport would allow Russia to quickly reinforce its fight with troops and supplies.

Matthew Chance, a CNN reporter who has been on the ground outside Kyiv, reported earlier Thursday that Russian airborne troops were engaged in a firefight with Ukrainian troops at the airfield.

""It shows us now for the first time just how close Russian forces have got towards the center of the Ukrainian capital,"" the reporter said.

Helicopters were seen flying low over the airfield, and witnesses nearby told AFP they saw fighter jets fire missiles at Ukrainian troops as the fighting began.

""Then there was shooting. It lasted three hours,"" one local resident told AFP. ""Then three more jets flew in and they started shooting again.""

While it was reported earlier Thursday that the Russian troops, who were identified by orange and black bands on the arm of their uniforms, had taken the airport, Ukraine may have since been able to retake the airfield.

An advisor to the Ukrainian president, after initially declaring prematurely that Ukraine had repelled the Russians, said on Facebook, ""Hostomel Airport is ours,"" and, ""Russian paratroopers have been destroyed."" The exact status of the airfield could not be independently confirmed.",https://www.businessinsider.com/ukraine-russia-fight-over-airfield-outside-kyiv-2022-2

Gen. Igor Konashenkov claimed Friday that Russian forces staged a ""successful landing operation"" to capture Hostomel airfield on the outskirts of Kyiv.

""More than 200 Russian helicopters were involved in the operation,"" according to the statement. ""The success of the landing was ensured by the suppression of the entire air defense system in the landing area, the complete isolation of the combat area from the air and the active conduct of electronic warfare.""

Konashenkov claimed that Russian forces killed more than 200 of the opposing forces and that there were no casualties among in the Russian Armed Forces.

CNN could not immediately corroborate those claims, but a CNN team on the ground witnessed Russian airborne troops taking positions at the airfield Thursday.

The Russian statement claimed — without evidence — that US military and intelligence advisers have instructed Ukrainian military leaders to place rocket artillery systems in residential areas to provoke return fire on local residents, echoing propaganda claims that the Russian military has made in Syria to counter allegations of civilian casualties caused by Russian strikes.

""I appeal to Ukrainian citizens,"" Konashenkov said. ""Your nationalist leadership uses the same methods as the terrorists. They want to use you as a human shield. The Russian Armed Forces will not inflict any strikes on residential areas of the Ukrainian capital.""

More context: Two residential buildings in Kyiv suffered damage in the early hours of Friday, but it's not clear if they were intentionally struck or hit by debris, or if anyone was injured.

Ukrainian Deputy Interior Minister Evgeny Yenin told CNN a Ukrainian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jet was shot down over Kyiv. Photos tweeted by the emergency forces appear to show a fire at a two-story private house with debris from what appears to be a plane nearby.

Feb. 24 (UPI) -- Ukrainian officials on Thursday said they reclaimed a key military airport as Russian special forces captured locations in the country including the Chernobyl power plant. The Ukrainian Parliament's official Telegram account said Antonov Airport in Hostomel was ""fully under the control"" of Ukrainian troops, which Deputy Interior Minister Anton Geraschenko called ""the first big victory,"" ABC News reported.

Video posted on social media earlier in the day appeared to show Russian military helicopters on the way to capturing international cargo airport and testing facility in a northwestern suburb of Kyiv.

""Twenty KA-52 and Mi-8 helicopters of the Russian Federation landed at the Gostomel airfield, fighting is ongoing. The enemy continues aggressive actions along the entire common border line,"" tweeted former Zelensky spokesperson Iuliia Mendel.

Earlier, Ukrainian officials said Russian military forces captured the entire area around the now-abandoned nuclear plant in Chernobyl, which includes the country's repository for nuclear waste from other power plants.

""The Chernobyl zone -- the exclusion zone -- and all installations of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant have been taken under control of Russian armed groups,"" Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said during a televised statement late Thursday, The Washington Post reported.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the United States was ""outraged"" citing ""credible reports"" that Russian soldiers are holding civilian staff of the power plant hostage,.

""This unlawful and dangerous hostage taking, which could upend the routine civil service efforts required to maintain and protect the nuclear waste facilities, is so obviously incredibly alarming and greatly concerning. We condemn it and we request their release.""

Chernobyl was the site of the world's largest nuclear disaster in 1986, after one of the plant's reactors melted down.

This comes after on-the-ground fighting between Russian soldiers and Ukrainian National Guard forces, which are routinely stationed around the plant as a safety measure.

Earlier Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted that Russian forces were trying to seize the Chernobyl plant.

""Our defenders are giving their lives so that the tragedy of 1986 will not be repeated,"" Zelensky tweeted.

""This is a declaration of war against the whole of Europe.""

Diplomat Olexander Scherba said that Zelensky had announced 137 fatalities including both members of the military and civilians.

Zelensky issued a declaration that Ukrainian males aged 18-60 were banned from leaving the country ""in order to ensure the defense of the state, maintaining combat and mobilization readiness of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other military formations.""

""Mobilization shall be carried out within 90 days from the date of entry into force of this decree,"" the announcement said.

Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Resnikov issued a statement Thursday saying the country was repelling the invasion by Russia but warned that additional attacks may be on the horizon.

""The Kremlin is planning a new wave of attacks, including using paratroopers, but our army is ready to meet them,"" Resnikov said.

He added the situation in the south remains ""difficult"" and heavy fighting took place in the Sumsky region north of Kyiv, while praising international sanctions against Russia.

""Tomorrow, Russia will learn the price of the Putinist insanity. We are on our soil and we will resist. And we will definitely win,"" Resnikov said.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also said he was ""convinced"" that Russia would move to overthrow the Ukrainian government.

""You don't need intelligence to tell you that that's exactly what President Putin wants. He has made clear he'd like to reconstitute the Soviet Empire, short of that he'd like to reassert a sphere of influence around the neighboring countries that were once part of the Soviet bloc"" he said.

Blinken also said NATO would stand in the way if Putin sought to set his sights beyond Ukraine.

""There's something very powerful standing in the way of that. That's something we call Article 5 of NATO. That means an attack on one member of NATO is an attack on all members of NATO,"" he said. ""The President's been very clear that we will defend every inch of NATO territory. I think that's the most powerful deterrent against President Putin going beyond Ukraine.""

In response to the military campaign, U.S. President Joe Biden announced a further ""severe"" round of sanctions Thursday against Russia, which now target all of its major banks.

""As a result of Putin's war of choice, Russia will face immediate and intense pressure on its economy, and massive costs from its isolation from the global financial system, global trade, and cutting-edge technology,"" Biden said from the White House.

""This includes cutting off Russia's largest bank from the U.S. financial system -- a significant blow to its ability to function and process global trade. It also includes full blocking sanctions on Russia's second largest bank -- freezing any of its assets touching the U.S. financial system. Russia's ability to access global markets, attract investment, and utilize the U.S. dollar will be devastated.""

Biden said sanctioning Putin personally remains an option.

The United States is also prepared to accept Ukrainian refugees and assist European countries neighboring Ukraine handle refugees fleeing a Russian invasion, Psaki said Sunday.

""We certainly expect that most if not the majority will want to go to Europe and neighboring countries,"" Psaki said. ""So, we are also working with European countries on what the needs are, where there is capacity. Poland for example, where we are seeing an increasing flow of refugees over the last 24 hours.""

The U.S. Agency for International Development deployed a Disaster Assistance Response Team made up of 17 disaster experts to assess the situation, identify priority needs and scale up assistance inside Ukraine alongside partners.

""The team will lead the U.S. Government's humanitarian response to help address critical needs caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, including responding to the needs of those internally displaced,"" the USAID said in a statement.

There were also fears the fighting could have environmental consequences for larger parts of Europe.

Al Jazeera reported that a Russian explosive hit a radioactive waste repository at Chernobyl, but could not immediately corroborate the account.

Radiation has continued to leak from the site since the 1986 meltdown, which is the reason for the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.

Multiple sources reported that the loss of Hostomel Airport forced a much larger Russian follow-on force to abort a full-scale airborne assault that could have put approximately 2,000 troops on the ground only minutes from downtown Kyiv.

After a day of fighting, Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, posted on Facebook that Hostomel (also known as Gostomel) had been retaken, posting: “Now we’ve definitely hit it off. Gostomel Airport is ours. Russian paratroopers have been destroyed.”

Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s Ministry of Internal Affairs, also said Ukrainian troops had retaken the airport, calling it “the first big victory.” The 4th Rapid Response Brigade’s Facebook page published a celebratory post: “Our guardsmen with their flag, torn to pieces after today’s battle. Congratulations to all of you and say that we will win!”

Hostomel sits roughly 10 miles northwest of Kyiv and normally services cargo flights. Russian forces appeared to have identified the field as a primary invasion target to allow large numbers of forces to be flown in.

A journalist with the open-source investigative website Bellingcat and several Russian flight trackers reported that, with the airport in Russian hands, 18 IL-76 cargo planes — roughly equivalent to American C-17s — were airborne and inbound to Hostomel.

If accurate, that many IL-76s could have delivered 2,000 troops and supporting vehicles.

However, a Ukrainian counterattack pushed the small Russian force off the airfield before the large aircraft arrived. A British citizen who joined the fighting on the Ukraine side provided Coffee or Die Magazine’s Nolan Peterson cell phone footage that captures the sound of the fighting.

Several reports said the unit that reclaimed the airport was Ukraine’s 4th Rapid Reaction Brigade, a special operations-style unit based near Kyiv.

An unconfirmed but stunning video appears to show a Ukrainian fighter jet “hunting” the fleeing Russians, firing rockets within feet of civilian homes.

The invasion began Thursday morning with a large-scale air assault. Videos show more than a dozen Mi-17 transport helicopters and Ka-52 and Ka-50 attack helicopters rushing toward the field over Kyiv, carrying paratroopers that the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense identified as being from the 11th Guards Air Assault Brigade, a Russian paratroop unit based in Ulan Ude, a city in the eastern portion of the country near Mongolia.

By midmorning, a CNN reporter interviewed Russian troops at the airport who appeared to have secured the grounds.

Pictures and videos taken during the assault showed at least two of the helicopters being shot down.
