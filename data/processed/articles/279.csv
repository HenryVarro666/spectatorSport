Kramer', 'Lucas Lilieholm', 'Victoria Kim', 'Katie Rogers', 'Keith Bradsher', 'Mike Ives']",2022-03-10 00:00:00,"Iuliia Shuvalova and Sergei Ignatev attended demonstrations after the Russian opposition leader Aleksei Navalny was imprisoned. They recently crossed into the United States from Tijuana, with no plans to return to Russia.

LOS ANGELES — Last fall, Iuliia Shuvalova and Sergei Ignatev, a young Russian couple, sold their car and took out a loan to pay for a holiday at a beach resort on Mexico’s Riviera Maya.

But they were not going on vacation. And they did not intend to return to Russia.

Once in Cancun, the couple purchased flights to Tijuana, a city just across the border from San Diego, and stayed there just long enough to buy a used car with a California license plate. At 4 a.m. on Dec. 2, they joined a line inching toward the U.S. border station in their $3,000 black Chrysler 200.

Ms. Shuvalova, 24, a political activist, said they were immediately honest with the American officers when they reached the inspection booth. “Sorry, we are Russians,” she told them. “We need asylum.”

At least two million Ukrainians have fled Russia’s assault on their nation to neighboring countries, and Russians, too, have been pouring out of their country in recent weeks amid crushing economic sanctions and a severe clampdown on public dissent. But a Russian exodus to the United States was already well underway, according to tallies on border crossings over the past year, as the number of Russians seeking asylum on the southern border grew to the highest numbers in recent history.

More than 4,100 Russians crossed the border without authorization in the 2021 fiscal year, nine times more than the previous year. This fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, the numbers are even higher — 6,420 during the first four months alone.

Ukrainians have also been crossing in greater numbers, with 1,000 apprehensions in the first four months of fiscal 2022 — some as recent as this week — compared with 676 in 2021.

Like Ms. Shuvalova and Mr. Ignatev, many of the newly arriving Russians are supporters of the jailed Russian opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny and said they no longer felt safe in their homeland. They include L.G.B.T.Q. people and religious minorities, such as Jehovah’s Witnesses, who were ostracized and harassed.

“I get calls every other day; people have been fleeing Russia like crazy,” said Anaida Zadykyan, an immigration lawyer in Los Angeles who has been helping Russians file asylum claims.

“Politically, the times in Russia are worse than during Stalin; people are living in terror,” said Ms. Zadykyan, who grew up in Moscow. “Economically, there is no money. People feel they can’t survive.”

The spike in Russian migration across the southern border coincides with a confluence of factors that have rendered it virtually impossible for Russians to enter the United States directly, and the number of asylum seekers soared in the months leading up to the invasion of Ukraine.

Strained relations between the United States and Russia had hobbled visa processing at the U.S. embassy in Moscow, as consular operations had also halted in nearby countries under pandemic shutdowns. All that limited legal options for reaching the United States, while Russians could still enter Mexico with relative ease, needing only a visa they obtained electronically.

Some Ukrainians have arrived at the U.S. border in the days since the Russian invasion began driving millions out of the country, though exact numbers have not yet been made public.

A mother and three children who showed up at the border in San Diego on Wednesday were refused entry, according to an immigrant advocate familiar with the case, but the U.S. authorities informed the family the following day that it would be allowed to enter.

Ukrainians in the United States have been inundating immigration lawyers with calls asking how they can sponsor relatives stranded in Poland and other countries. “There is newfound panic, and demand is overwhelming,” said Jeff Khurgel, a Russian-speaking lawyer in Irvine, Calif. U.S. consulates in some European cities have begun expediting visas, he said.

Russians and Ukrainians represent only a small fraction of all the people crossing the southern border. But unlike most migrants from Mexico and Central America, who have often been turned away since the beginning of the pandemic, they are being allowed to make asylum claims at ports of entry. And while a vast majority of asylum cases are ultimately denied, two-thirds of those from Russia and Ukraine have been winning their cases, according to government data analyzed by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.

Between June and Feb. 21, with the exception of one week, Russians were among the top-three nationalities assisted by the San Diego Rapid Response Network, which offers food and lodging to migrants after their release from U.S. border custody. The network has also been receiving a small but growing number of Ukrainians, and the volume is expected to increase in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion, assuming access to Mexico remains relatively easy.

“This is about to become a torrent,” said Lou Correa, a Democratic representative from California who recently testified in Congress about what he witnessed at the San Ysidro port of entry near San Diego. “You are going to have destitute Ukrainians and hungry Russians.”

A flight that he boarded from Cancun to Tijuana six weeks ago was packed with Russian speakers, he said in an interview.

To qualify for asylum in the United States, applicants must establish that they have a well-founded fear of persecution on account of their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. All those who cross without visas are placed in deportation proceedings, and make a case for asylum during court hearings.

L.G.B.T.Q. people from Russia have for years been seeking asylum in the United States. But in recent years, the pressure against them in Russia has escalated with a spate of state-sanctioned discriminatory policies, especially in the Russian republic of Chechnya, according to advocates who have been working with the new immigrants.

“The increase in L.G.B.T.Q. asylum seekers coming over the border reflects the desperation that people are feeling,” said Tess Feldman, an immigration lawyer at the Los Angeles LGBT Center.

Jehovah’s Witnesses, subjected to raids and imprisonment since a Russian court labeled the Christian denomination an extremist group in 2017, have been heading to the U.S. border with photographs of themselves worshiping and proof they were baptized, said Mr. Khurgel, the immigration lawyer.

Most Russians driving through San Diego-area border crossings have been following tips shared by groups on the encrypted messaging app Telegram — about how to plan the journey, find car dealers in Tijuana and avoid arousing suspicions. (Hint: Don’t buy a beater car.)

In December, when a record 2,000 Russians were encountered, officers fired at two vehicles carrying 18 Russians as they raced toward the San Ysidro port of entry. Bullets hit one car, which crashed into the other, and two migrants suffered minor injuries.

Ilia Kiselev, 29, a Russian opposition activist who made the trip in November, said he had felt increasingly vulnerable after a Russian court last June classified organizations linked to Mr. Navalny, the jailed Kremlin critic, as extremist. He attended opposition rallies and hoisted posters denouncing parliamentary elections in September as a sham. The police in his hometown, Yaroslavl, wrote down his information and then came searching for him at his house, he said.

“I knew that I was a target, and I had to get out of Russia before it was too late,” Mr. Kiselev said in a recent interview at a cafe in Los Angeles.

In late November, he paid $1,500 for a vacation package to Playa del Carmen, a popular beach town south of Cancun. Once there, he spent $220 on airfare to Tijuana and to Mexico City; he never meant to fly to the capital but had read on Telegram that Mexican officials had been detaining Russians with one-way tickets to the border city.

From Tijuana, Mr. Kiselev and a fellow Russian rode to the border on a bright-red Honda motorcycle.

After requesting asylum, they were handcuffed and detained in a room with about 15 people, mainly from Russia, he recalled, until being allowed to proceed to Los Angeles.

His roommate, Vadim Fridovskii, 34, another activist, was turned back by American officers who were standing a few feet short of the port of entry. (Asylum claims can be made only by people who touch American soil.) A few hours later, Mr. Fridovskii and his group managed to make it to the drive-up window, and to request asylum.

Before deciding to seek asylum in the United States, Ms. Shuvalova and Mr. Ignatev said, they had participated in activities organized by supporters of Mr. Navalny in their hometown, Ulyanovsk.

“We saw with our own eyes people being beaten and arrested; we could be next,” Ms. Shuvalova, a chemist, said while sitting beside her husband, a chef, on a recent afternoon.

The couple tried to gain entry to Poland, only to be refused visas. So they turned to social networks, where people were swapping information about how to enter the United States via Mexico.

They told their families that they were planning a beach vacation in Mexico.

“They would never understand the truth. They think we are zombies, programmed by Western propaganda,” Ms. Shuvalova said.

In late November, the couple boarded a charter flight from Moscow to Cancun, with two carry-ons and one suitcase between them. The flight was full, the couple recalled.

They spent a few nail-biting days in Cancun arranging travel to Tijuana after getting a tip that the Mexican authorities had been arresting Russians in hotels. At the border town, they bought a car and, with the help of GPS, made their way to the border.

As their car crawled toward the checkpoint, Ms. Shuvalova said, she was trembling.

When they reached the window and requested asylum, “the American officers chuckled and replied, ‘Oh, more Russians,’” she recalled, before instructing them to pull to the side.

After two days in detention, the couple was bused to a San Diego shelter with a notice to appear in immigration court, their throwaway car impounded by the U.S. authorities.

Watching events unfold in Ukraine and Russia, they have been horrified but also especially grateful that they left their homeland, even though some relatives call them “traitors,” Mr. Ignatev said. The couple are expecting their first child, who will be an American.",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/03/10/world/ukraine-russia-war

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

MR PRICE: Good afternoon.

QUESTION: Good afternoon.

MR PRICE: As we have noted in recent days and recent hours, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is beginning. Hours after Russia recognized the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics as, quote/unquote, “independent,” President Putin authorized Russian troops to enter those regions. He has taken other steps that amount to a direct assault on Ukraine’s sovereignty.

We responded in turn quickly and decisively. Within less than a day, we’d announced the first tranche of sanctions with our allies and partners, including those in the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, and Australia.

Our German allies, yesterday, took resolute action to ensure that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, what had been a prized $11 billion investment on the part of the Russian Federation, is suspended indefinitely. And as you have just seen, President Biden today authorized sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG and its corporate office-holders. We have now taken complementary action using our own authorities to ensure that Nord Stream 2 is off the table, just as we said it would be.

In lockstep with our allies, we are blocking from the global financial system two large banks that are connected to the Kremlin and Russian military, and Russian sovereign wealth can no longer trade on U.S. or European financial markets. As you all know, we additionally sanctioned Russian elites, those elites who are in many ways complicit.

This is the beginning of our response. If Putin escalates further, we will escalate further using additional sanctions and export controls, which we’ve yet to unveil but are fully prepared to implement with allies and partners across the globe.

The sequence of events that Secretary Blinken laid out at the UN Security Council last week appears to be proceeding exactly as he laid out. We’ve seen false flags, we’ve seen provocations, we’ve seen theatrically staged meetings at the Kremlin, we’ve seen cyber operations, and the list goes on.

So where do we go from here? Moscow needs to demonstrate that it’s serious about diplomacy. Russia’s actions over the last 48 hours have, in fact, demonstrated the opposite. If Moscow’s approach changes, we remain ready to engage.

The United States and our allies and partners remain open to diplomacy. We are eager to engage to avert what would be a brutal and costly conflict, but as we have said, diplomacy cannot succeed unless Russia changes course.

As we have said, we are prepared. We are prepared for any contingency going forward.

Matt.

QUESTION: Okay. Thanks. I have a question about the Houthi sanctions, but it’s largely semantic, so I’ll leave it ‘til later.

On Nord Stream 2, you guys had been saying for months – indeed, for over a year, since the waivers were first granted – that in fact this gave you additional leverage, withholding the sanctions did, and would serve as a deterrent. Clearly it didn’t – they didn’t provide you with any leverage at all that we can tell, because of what you just said in your opening statement about the invasion beginning. So how do you explain to people why you didn’t impose these sanctions earlier?

MR PRICE: So Matt, it’s important – and let’s just rewind the tape and remember what has happened in recent hours. Yesterday, within a short timeframe of the Russian invasion beginning, Germany took decisive, resolute action to take Nord Stream 2 off the table. Today, we followed with our own complementary authorities using the powers and capabilities that we have.

We have always said in the context of Nord Stream 2, in the context of the steps that we are taking with partners and allies around the world, that one of the most important tools we have in our arsenal is transatlantic unity. The fact that Germany acted so quickly, so decisively, is in many ways a product of the coordination of the consultation we have done now with two successive German governments. Of course, this started with Chancellor Merkel and her government, and in more recent months we have had concerted discussions with Chancellor Scholz and his government.

The fact that we are acting in unison immediately to take these steps that essentially remove Nord Stream 2 from the equation – that is a byproduct, that is a result of the work that we have done together with the German Government over the course of these last several months, over the course of the last year or so.

QUESTION: So it sounds to me – and correct me if I’m wrong – that your argument is that if you had imposed the sanctions earlier, the Germans wouldn’t have suspended – done – the Germans wouldn’t have done what they did yesterday, or it would have been a much bigger lift to get them to do that.

MR PRICE: What we have said, and our – what —

QUESTION: (Off-mike.)

MR PRICE: Our strategy has been predicated on the knowledge that transatlantic unity is the most powerful instrument we have.

QUESTION: That’s fine, but I don’t – but look, the pipeline’s already been built, okay? Now, whether it gets turned on or not is another —

MR PRICE: Well, but —

QUESTION: — is another question.

MR PRICE: Right. So you —

QUESTION: But presumably you had more leverage – and I don’t understand why you don’t think that you would have had more leverage if it hadn’t been – if these sanctions had been imposed before the pipeline was finished.

MR PRICE: So, Matt, you also raise a good point. The pipeline, when this administration came into office, was more than 90 percent complete. We have imposed sanctions under PEESA on a number of targets associated with this pipeline, persons and entities. But the fact is that had we sanctioned Nord Stream 2 AG, had we sanctioned its corporate office holders, it is far from clear that that would have kept the pipeline from going into operation. What the Germans did yesterday was to ensure that the pipeline is no longer part of the equation.

QUESTION: Right.

MR PRICE: So by acting together with the Germans how we did, when we did, and the way in which we did, we have ensured that this is an $11 billion prize investment that is now a hunk of steel sitting at the bottom of the sea.

QUESTION: All right, well, I don’t think you, though, can prove – and the converse can’t be proven either. But you just don’t know if imposing the sanctions earlier would have had more of a deterrent effect or any deterrent effect —

MR PRICE: Well, if we would have made it a sunk cost many, many months ago for the Russian Federation, I don’t think that would have had much deterrent capability.

QUESTION: Well, it hasn’t anyway, so I’ll leave it there.

MR PRICE: Simon.

QUESTION: Yeah, the Secretary obviously said yesterday he had canceled his meeting with Foreign Minister Lavrov, but you guys remain open to diplomacy. So what exactly would you want to see from Russia in order to reschedule that meeting, in order to resume some kind of diplomacy, diplomatic talks between you? And just an additional one: You’ve sort of – this is the last – or this is part of the first tranche of sanctions, the Nord Stream 2 sanctions that just came out. Is that the end of the first tranche or is there more coming in that? And can you say whether more sanctions actions will be taken if Russia doesn’t escalate further from where it is now?

MR PRICE: Well, the question you ask is what we would like to see. Let me tell you – let me start by answering that question by letting you know what we no longer will engage in, and that is the pretense of diplomacy. You heard the Secretary use that phrase yesterday, and that is what we have seen. This is and has been, in some ways, diplomatic kabuki theater on the part of the Russians – making statements that they are committed to a diplomatic path while their actions suggest exactly the opposite. That is not an environment in which diplomacy can achieve the results that it needs to achieve.

Our goal here, even as the Russian invasion of Ukraine is beginning, is to avert the worst-case scenario, the worst-case scenario that we have warned about for some time now. And we have gone into great detail in terms of what that could look like: electronic warfare; the – a fuller-scale invasion, an attack on major urban centers, including Kyiv, a city of 2.9 million people; horrific human rights abuses, atrocities, potential war crimes. These are all things that, even as the invasion is beginning, we are going to do everything that we reasonably can to prevent from happening.

And so that’s why, together with our allies and partners, we absolutely remain open to diplomacy, but only if Moscow is serious. We are not going to engage in this pretense with them during which they draw out the process – suggest one thing, do another, ready their preparations, move their forces closer to the border, develop and refine their plans – as they give the world a head fake that they are actually committed to the diplomatic path.

Now, there are a number of ways that Moscow could indicate that it is serious. It essentially boils down to de-escalation. That would be the most concrete, the clearest indication that diplomacy has the potential to bear fruit, that diplomacy has the potential to save lives. That is the kind of diplomacy we are interested in. That is also not the kind of diplomacy that we have seen any indication, as of yet, that Moscow is interested in.

Vivian.

QUESTION: Can you comment on the reports that the U.S. informed the Ukrainian Government that an attack could happen as soon as tonight and that Kharkiv is possibly in the line of attack, that it could be directly – that the Russian troops could roll over the border and attack Kharkiv tonight?

MR PRICE: What I’ll say about those reports is they are entirely consistent with what we have been saying for some time now: that Russia has amassed forces along Ukraine’s borders, in Belarus; positioned the assets, the heavy weaponry, the soldiers, the service members it would need to undertake an invasion of Ukraine at a moment’s notice. That has been true for some time now.

So for several days now, we have said the invasion is potentially imminent, meaning it could start today. It could start tomorrow; it could start next week. What we haven’t seen is – and this goes back to Simon’s question – is any indication that the Russians are backing away from this. We have not seen any data points that alleviate the grave concern, the profound concern that we’ve been expressing for some time yet – some time now. So the invasion remains potentially imminent, and Moscow is poised to do precisely the kinds of things that you just outlined.

QUESTION: Can I just follow up real quickly also on something Simon said, that you and Simon discussed? With this notion of diplomacy still on the table and now you’re saying that it’s possible that – Donbas is obviously being attacked if not actually, then rhetorically; that the Russians are now acknowledging or recognizing their autonomy and sovereignty. So how can you then justify discussions about diplomacy when this is underway? I mean, you keep on saying that the Russians have to show that they’re serious. They have to de-escalate. But could they pause things right now and possibly engage in talks with the U.S., or do significant sort of scale-back have to happen? Do we have to see troops falling back before that’s discussed? Is Donbas being regarded differently from the rest of the country?

MR PRICE: So you heard from our colleagues at the White House and others here over the course of the day yesterday, including the Secretary, that the invasion is beginning. And when we spoke about the beginning of the invasion, we talked about several developments over the course of that 24-hour period: Vladimir Putin’s recognition of the so-called DNR and LNR; the order that he conveyed to the ministry of defense to deploy forces into the Donbas; the authorization that he sought to send Russian servicemembers into service extraterritorially; the rhetorical assault, essentially, that we saw President Putin deliver against Ukraine denying Ukraine its sovereignty and, essentially, its right to exist. Those are what we’ve seen. Those are what we’ve heard.

But as I just mentioned, there are some things – many things, in fact – that Russia is poised to do at a moment’s notice that we have not yet seen. A large-scale invasion, an assault on urban centers, the human rights abuses, the potential war crimes, the atrocities that we have great concern could take place, these are all things that we want to prevent.

So you asked the question, why would we engage in diplomacy? Well, we would engage in diplomacy to save lives. We would engage in diplomacy to prevent an all-out war. This is a war that would be brutal. It would be costly. It would be in many ways devastating for the Russian Federation, of course for the Ukrainian people. And the way in which the Russian Federation would wage this war, you heard from the National Security Advisor, it would not be a type of conflict that you might imagine over territory or over concrete ends. You heard the National Security Advisor make the case that this would be a war waged against the Ukrainian people to subjugate them, to crush them, to exact in many ways revenge.

This is what we want to prevent. So we are ready to engage, but we need a partner. We need a negotiating counterpart that demonstrates seriousness of purpose. We have not seen that from the Russian Federation; in fact, we have seen the opposite at every turn.

Andrea?

QUESTION: Ned, do we have diplomats right now in Lviv? Or are they spending their nights in Poland and going back and forth? Have we made any kind of commitment to the safe passage, to any kind of extraction, if you will, for key members of the Zelenskyy government, if necessary? And what would be our commitment to any insurgency that developed, given if it were a full-scale invasion, if any? I mean, there was training. There was support.

And one final question —

MR PRICE: I should write these down.

QUESTION: Sorry. Your reaction to former Secretary of State Pompeo and former President Trump praising Putin’s cleverness, strength, and smartness in the last couple of days?

MR PRICE: I’ll start with that one. I have no response. In fact, I have no words.

To move on to Lviv, I think what you heard from us on Sunday is that the Secretary had determined that it was in the best interests, in the best interests of the safety and security of our team on the ground, for them to temporarily relocate into Poland. They have been spending the night in Poland, but they have been regularly essentially commuting back into Lviv. Our chargé, Kristina Kvien, has been leading the team back on the ground in Lviv. We have every expectation that they will continue to do so as long as the security environment remains permissive.

When they’re on the ground in Lviv, they’re able to undertake emergency consular services to help Americans who may be seeking to leave the country. They are engaging with our Ukrainian partners, and they have important missions that they’re able to fulfill in Lviv.

But regardless of whether they’re in Lviv, whether they are in Poland, that in no way changes the commitment we have to our Ukrainian partners. It in no way diminishes the partnership we have with Kyiv. We’ve remained in constant contact with our partners in the Ukrainian Government, and that takes me to your question about any advice we may have passed on to the Zelenskyy government.

The fact is that we are in contact with our friends and counterparts in Kyiv on a daily basis. As you know, Foreign Minister Kuleba was here yesterday. The President had an opportunity to speak to President Zelenskyy over the weekend. The Secretary was in the Oval Office for that call. The president, President Zelenskyy and his team, know that they have the steadfast and unwavering support of the United States. Of course, our goal in all of this is to avert that worst-case scenario, the worst-case scenario that we’ve already talked about in the course of this briefing. The fact is that the president and his team will make decisions in the coming days best – based on the best interests of their country and their people. The foreign minister was asked a question about this just yesterday. He provided an insight into their thinking. But these will be decisions that our Ukrainian counterparts will make based on their own determinations and their own calculus.

In terms of our – let me put it this way. In terms of our continued assistance to our Ukrainian partners, the President has made very clear that in the event of a Russian invasion – which, as we have said, is beginning – we will not only continue our defensive security assistance to our Ukrainian partners, but we will double down on it. So on top of the unprecedented level of defensive security assistance that we provided to our Ukrainian partners over the last year – $650 million, including a $200 million drawdown that the President signed in December, deliveries of which continue to flow into Kyiv, flow into Ukraine I should say – we will continue – not only continue to provide that support, but we will look to further that defensive security assistance for our Ukrainian partners.

Kylie.

QUESTION: I’m just wondering if Russia has responded at all to Blinken’s letter yesterday and what diplomatic conversations between the U.S. and Russia have looked like in the last 24 hours.

MR PRICE: What I’ll say is we – the Secretary laid out for Foreign Minister Lavrov in a private communication the fact that, under the current circumstances and what we have seen from the Russian Federation so far, our conclusion that a meeting this week in Geneva would not serve the purpose that any such meeting would need to serve. And first and foremost, that is to avert a brutal, massive, costly conflict. The Russians, and all of you later, heard that publicly from Secretary Blinken. The Russians know precisely our position. They know through private communications and through our own public messaging that we stand ready to engage diplomatically if they are willing to do so in good faith, and if they are willing to change their posture we will be ready, willing, and able to engage them on this.

QUESTION: And did the Secretary detail what “in good faith” would look like in this letter, or was it broad descriptions like you just gave?

MR PRICE: We are not going to be prescriptive in terms of what de-escalation might look like, what good faith might look like. We have been very clear – because all of you know, presumably our counterparts in the Russian Federation know – what steps might look like if they were interested in signaling de-escalation. We have not seen any of those steps. And again, we have seen steps that actually move in the opposite direction.

QUESTION: And then just a last question. Can or will the U.S. keep open our embassy in Moscow if there is a full-scale invasion into Ukraine?

MR PRICE: We believe, in times of conflict, in times of crisis, that the ability to communicate is in some ways even more imperative. Now, long before the massive Russian military buildup started along Ukraine’s borders, in Belarus, of course, our team on the ground in Moscow and throughout Russia, they were in a very difficult operating environment – a very difficult operating environment because of the restrictions that the Russian Federation had imposed on them. It will be our goal to be in a position to maintain diplomatic communication, the ability to convey clearly any messages that we need to send to the Russian Federation. Embassies are an important tool in that, but we have also seen the Russian Federation even in recent days escalate on an unprovoked and needless basis the bilateral challenges in terms of our own diplomatic staffing in Moscow and our ability to operate an embassy on the ground. But again, we believe communication, we believe the ability to pass messages is even more important in times of great crisis.

QUESTION: Ned, on Nord Stream, are you working with the Germans to find alternative sources of energy for them? I mean, it seems like the pipeline is not going to go full – or going to go operational anytime soon, so are you working with them, with the Qataris or any other potential suppliers, perhaps in Algeria and so on, and about the means to get it there?

And I have a quick question on the diplomacy.

MR PRICE: Sure. Let me start with your question on the energy, and of course, this was something that President Biden discussed yesterday. We have been frank, we have been candid with the American people that our measures – the measures we have and are prepared to impose on the Russian Federation – certainly won’t be cost-free for the Russian Federation, but they won’t be entirely cost-free for the rest of the world as well. And so that is why we are working with countries around the world, executing a plan with major producing and consuming countries to secure the stability of global energy supplies, whether that’s oil, whether that’s LNG.

For energy consumers – and you heard this from Deputy National Security Advisor Daleep Singh yesterday – he made the point that we all have strategic reserves at our disposal, and those reserves we know could support the supply of global energy. The White House announced such a move late last year. There are other countries that have their own strategic supplies. For energy producers, we know that many of them have spare capacity to provide supply to global markets that could balance those markets in the event of any supply disruption.

More broadly, we’ve been very clear with the Russian Federation that any further attempt to weaponize energy, to constrict flows with malign geopolitical intent or purpose, would have massive consequences and, to your point, would only further the longstanding effort to diversify energy supplies for Europe and the rest of the world. We have heard from a number of countries, including Japan, including Australia, including Slovakia, that they are taking concrete steps in terms of global energy markets. We expect other countries will have announcements of their own. We also know that the International Energy Agency has announced that it’s monitoring and consulting with member states to ensure market stability going forward.

But to the question about diversification of supply, this has been a longstanding goal of ours. And to go back to the question of Nord Stream 2, there was the communiqué that together we drafted and finalized with the German Government over the summer, in the summer of July of 2021. It laid out a series of steps that Germany committed to taking with Ukraine to help Ukraine diversify its supply of energy, cognizant that Russia had weaponized energy flows in the past and Russia might have been looking to do so again in the future. If Russia were to take that step, we’ve been very clear about the massive consequences that would befall it.

QUESTION: Very quickly to follow up on Kylie’s and your response to her on diplomacy. So are you urging the Ukrainians not to cut off relations with Russia? Because there was talk that they might cut off all diplomatic relations with Russia.

MR PRICE: That’s a decision for the Ukrainian Government to make.

QUESTION: Of course, but are you bringing them – I mean, if they decided to cut off their relations with Russia, you wouldn’t say, “No, don’t do it now” or “Go ahead, do it”?

MR PRICE: That is a decision for the Ukrainian Government to make. Again, the Russian Federation has launched an assault on Ukraine’s sovereignty, on its territorial integrity, in many different ways and many different forms. But the decision as to whether to continue diplomatic relations between Kyiv and Moscow, that’s something that Kyiv will have to decide.

QUESTION: Ned, on the diplomacy, I’m curious about your reference publicly from the podium to what the Russians have been doing as kabuki theater. What specifically are you referring to? The meeting in Geneva between Secretary Blinken and Foreign Minister Lavrov? The UN Security Council meeting last week or even – whatever it was – a day or two ago? The Russian National Security – the —

MR PRICE: So I think you could point to any number of steps. The – what comes to my mind immediately was the dramatic, theatrical scene we saw – I guess it was last week now – between President Putin and his deputies, in which they had what was scripted, I assume, to be a pretty candid exchange indicating that the Russian Federation should pursue diplomacy, only as, at that very moment and in the days that followed, we saw additional Russian forces go to the border.

QUESTION: Right, but that —

MR PRICE: We saw additional Russian forces take up readiness. That is not consistent with a country that purports to be interested in diplomacy.

QUESTION: No, but that is not diplomacy per se. That was an internal government meeting. Whether they – it was staged or what —

MR PRICE: That was kabuki theater, I think we can agree.

QUESTION: Well, fine, yeah, but I want to know if you’re talking about the meeting in Geneva between the Secretary and Foreign Minister Lavrov.

MR PRICE: I was referring to the incident of kabuki theater that I just mentioned to you.

QUESTION: You’re referring specifically – okay, because I just want to make sure that you don’t think – you’re not now in a position where you think that the meeting in Geneva that did happen was a waste of time and simply an entertainment.

MR PRICE: Look, I wouldn’t want to characterize —

QUESTION: Or the Security Council meetings are a waste of time because – I just want to make sure that you’re not talking about those.

MR PRICE: Well, I – so the UN Security Council meeting most certainly was not a waste of time because the Russian Federation and the entire world heard from a number of countries the broad and strong consensus that this should be resolved diplomatically and that state sovereignty should be an inviolable principle. That certainly was not pointless.

Yes.

QUESTION: (Off-mike.)

MR PRICE: Sure.

QUESTION: Because before the Security Council meeting, U.S. officials said that they believed Russia could be using it as a pretext for this invasion. And you said earlier that this is and has been in some ways kabuki theater all along. So are you – to Matt’s point, are you making the assessment that the —

MR PRICE: The security – the Russian Security Council meeting you’re referring to?

QUESTION: No, sorry, the one last Thursday, before there was a briefing where U.S. officials said they believed given the document that the Russian mission circulated that they were going to use the meeting as a pretext. So do you assess now that all of these diplomatic engagements were part of a charade to give Russia cover, to show that they had been engaging in good faith diplomacy in their mind?

MR PRICE: I wouldn’t want to make a sweeping categorical judgment like that. What I will say is that, if you take a step back, we have not seen any indication that Russia’s stated commitment to the diplomatic path had – bore any resemblance to its actions or that its actions reflected any commitment to – stated commitment to the diplomatic path. That is not to say that there is not value in these sessions, and I think the UN Security Council session that you all saw last Thursday was extraordinarily valuable. It was valuable for – even for the Russian Federation, and if any of those messages got to the Russian people, they would have heard a strong message of resolve and consensus and unanimity from the rest of the world that the steps that Putin was taking, the plans that he may well still have in mind, that is not something that the rest of the world is prepared to countenance.

QUESTION: But the meetings in Geneva, the non-papers back and forth, that – you don’t think that that all was a charade by the Russian Government?

MR PRICE: I am not prepared to use such wholesale language. Now, have we been able to deter and to prevent the worst-case scenario? That’s still an unresolved question. What is not unresolved is that we have seen continued signs that the Russian Federation is moving forward with the plans that we have been warning about for weeks.

QUESTION: Can I have another follow-up?

QUESTION: Can I just point out that some people do find value in kabuki theater, especially the Japanese, who invented it?

MR PRICE: That’s – no —

QUESTION: They pay to go see it, so —

MR PRICE: No offense intended.

Yes.

QUESTION: Can I just – another follow-up?

MR PRICE: Yeah, yeah.

QUESTION: Yesterday Foreign Minister Kuleba said that their Plan A, obviously, is to use diplomacy to deter Russia. Plan B is to defend every inch of Ukrainian territory. You have previously praised their restraint. Do you agree with their Plan B? Do you think they have a right to self-defense? And if Russia moves past the current areas that the separatists control in the Donbas, do the Ukrainians have a right to respond?

MR PRICE: Of course, the Ukrainians have a right to self-defense.

Yes.

QUESTION: So I find there have been a lot of mixed signals coming from the PRC in terms of its stance on the Ukraine situation. At times they’ve talked about the importance of state sovereignty; other times they’ve railed against NATO expansion. Have you – has the State Department been in communication with PRC interlocutors seeking clarity on their position? And have you laid out any ways in which these ongoing signals might undercut U.S.-China ties?

And on a related note, you’ve kind of hinted before that if the PRC were to seek to undermine the impact of U.S. sanctions on Russia, then the U.S. would have countermeasures. Have those discussions continued with PRC interlocutors?

MR PRICE: Well, as you know, Secretary Blinken had an opportunity to speak to his counterpart, Foreign Minister Wang, just the other night. And one of the two primary topics they discussed was Russia’s – the crisis that Russia has needlessly precipitated with Ukraine and with the rest of the world. Secretary Blinken – and we issued a readout; the PRC also issued their own readout – but you saw in our readout that the Secretary made very clear where we stand in terms of our unwavering support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity and its sovereignty. And I think especially that last point, sovereignty, should be an element that the PRC understands quite well. We often in statecraft hear the PRC cite this principle of sovereignty, which in any number of instances they have claimed should be inviolable, should be sacrosanct, should be one of the foundational rules that countries abide by and respect.

So you’ll have to ask the PRC how they marry that longstanding position with anything less than an effort to use the considerable influence and sway they have with the Russian Federation to urge Vladimir Putin to back down, to de-escalate. Whether they are doing that, you’ll have to ask them. But we did see in the readout that our PRC counterparts are also calling for the situation to be resolved diplomatically and to be resolved peacefully. Now, whether Putin heeds that call, I think that is not something we yet know.

QUESTION: And what about relaying the potential impact on U.S.-China relations?

MR PRICE: Look, in terms of our bilateral relationship with —

QUESTION: In terms of China’s support for Russia in its railing against NATO expansion and the potential tacit endorsement that that provides – what’s the impact of that on U.S.-China relations?

MR PRICE: Well, we believe – and we’ve made this point not only about the PRC, but every responsible country in the world has, in our estimation, an obligation to use any influence it has with the Russian Federation to urge, to incentivize, to advocate for Vladimir Putin to back down, for the Russian Federation to de-escalate. Again, you will have to ask the PRC whether they have used their own considerable influence with the Russian Federation to that end. Of course, we’ve all read the 5,000-word joint communiqué, and we can glean our own conclusions from that.

I think what gives us concern is that – from that manifesto and from what we’ve seen not only in recent days, weeks, and months, but in recent years – is this growing partnership between Russia and the PRC. And I say it’s concerning because we talk about a rules-based international order, a rules-based international order that has been at the crux of seven-plus decades of unprecedented levels of stability, of security, of prosperity the world over, whether that’s in Europe or the Indo-Pacific and places in between.

It is true, I think, we think, that Russia and the PRC also want a world order. This is a vision that they appear to be developing together if you read that communiqué. But this is an order that is and would be profoundly illiberal, an order that stands in contrast to the system that countries around the world – including, by the way, Russia and in some ways the PRC – have built over the last seven decades. It is an order that is in many ways destructive rather than additive.

So that is as we see this relationship develop, and we’ve seen something that gives us great concern. And of course, in recent days we’ve seen Russia reach out to its autocratic counterparts in other corners of the globe. This gets back to one of the core points that the President has been making since before he assumed high office, and that is, increasingly, we are seeing the world divided between democracy and autocracy. It is and has been a charge of this President and this administration’s foreign policy to act to unite our democratic colleagues around the world, to act in unison, to galvanize collective action. And I think whether the challenge has been what Russia is doing, whether the challenge has been what the PRC is doing, what we are seeing from state and non-state actors around the world, you’ve seen us succeed in that.

But it will continue to be an animating principle as we continue to see the forces of autocracy, the forces of authoritarianism, the forces of illiberalism continue to work together and attempt to combine forces. But the other point, even as they try to do that, we are confident. We are confident in our own abilities. We are confident in our abilities as an international community, and whether that’s the West, whether that’s a community of democracies, whether it is our system of alliances and partnerships that span the globe.

And we’re confident for a number of reasons. If you look at it quantitatively, we have 50 percent-plus of global GDP. We have a large share of the world’s population. China and Russia, in terms of their GDP are, what, 20 percent of global GDP? We have innovation. We have entrepreneurship. We have a shared set of values that we really think are a core instrument of national power. And we know that when we put all of this together, especially when we act with our allies and our partners – as we’ve done in the face of the challenge that Russia has posed, in the face of the challenge to the rules-based international system that the PRC has posed – or even when you talk about the threats and challenges that we face that are not state actors – climate change, COVID, economic recovery – we know that acting together, we are situated to take on any threat, to seize any opportunity.

And that’s really been the driving force of our foreign policy. It’s why Secretary Blinken spent so much time of his first year in office repairing, revitalizing, in some ways reimagining the system of alliances and partnerships. And you’re seeing the dividends of that now play out, even in recent hours.

QUESTION: Well, first of all, can you guess how long that answer was, how many minutes that was?

MR PRICE: (Laughter.) I’m sure you will tell me.

QUESTION: I’ll pull it up – well, I can’t because my Otter seems to have, like, frozen here. But if —

MR PRICE: Yeah. I haven’t paid for the premium version.

QUESTION: But if you’re – yeah – but if you’re boasting about reinventing it and you’re seeing that – the fruits of all that labor now, you’re talking about the united reaction against —

MR PRICE: United – the united response of the international community.

QUESTION: To Russia?

MR PRICE: Yeah.

QUESTION: Okay. Can I – purely – it’s unrelated to Ukraine, but it is China. And that is something that I know Nike is interested in and has been asking about before. But there is barely an anniversary, a diplomatic – an anniversary in diplomatic history that goes by without the U.S. – the State Department at least, if not the White House – making some kind of comment about it. And in that light, regardless of how tense or strained relations are now with China, why is it that there hasn’t been any mention of Nixon’s – former President Nixon’s – the 50th anniversary of former President Nixon’s visit to China, which was a pretty groundbreaking event when it happened, paved the way for recognition or U.S. recognition of the PRC and opening of diplomatic relations.

And it seems to me that it would make sense for there to be some kind of mention of this, or are you just, like, embarrassed by it now and think that it should never have happened?

MR PRICE: I don’t think – certainly not the latter. I – Matt, there are some anniversaries that we commemorate there. There are other anniversaries that we don’t. I’m not aware of any plans at the moment for a statement, but —

QUESTION: Yeah, but (inaudible) statements about, like, the 17th anniversary of U.S.-Iceland relations or something – not to demean Iceland – but I mean, these kinds of things get attention. And this one, which was, a pretty big deal – a BFD, as the President might say – at the time and since, just seems to be being ignored.

MR PRICE: I don’t know that we’re ignoring it. I’m not sure that I would equate not putting out a formal statement with ignoring it.

Nike.

QUESTION: Thank you, Matt, for asking (inaudible). But my question is on Pakistan. Can I ask about Pakistan Prime Minister Khan’s visit to Russia? Does the State Department have a – an assessment of his visit at this timing?

MR PRICE: Well, we’re certainly aware of the trip, and the points I made earlier about the PRC in some ways apply here. We believe it’s the responsibility of every responsible country around the world to voice concern, to voice objection to what Putin appears to have in mind for Ukraine. We’ve communicated to Pakistan our position regarding Russia’s further renewed invasion of Ukraine, and we have briefed them on our efforts to pursue diplomacy over war. We have a longstanding partnership and cooperation with Pakistan. We view our partnership with a prosperous, with a democratic Pakistan as critical to U.S. interests. And we certainly hope, when it comes to those shared interests – the aversion of a costly conflict, the aversion of a destabilizing conflict, that every country around the world would make that point clearly in unambiguous language in their engagements with the Russian Federation.

Andrea.

QUESTION: On the —

QUESTION: Can I – sorry, can I just follow up on Khan’s visit? On the timing of his visit, is it the U.S. read that he’s indirectly endorsing Putin?

MR PRICE: You would have to ask the Pakistani Government what the intent is.

QUESTION: But I’m asking your read.

MR PRICE: You would have to ask the Pakistani Government. I’m just not in a position to offer an assessment on the timing of foreign counterparts’ travel to another country.

Yes, Andrea.

QUESTION: Do you have a different assessment of Vladimir Putin than the one that this government had – that this President had – after Geneva, or was the previous assessment wrong?

MR PRICE: The previous assessment and the assessment now is that we would prefer a relationship with Russia that is stable and predictable. But at every turn before Geneva or just about every turn before Geneva and at turns since Geneva, the Russian Federation has indicated that they have apparently little interest in that type of relationship. So we’ve always said that – and we said this before Geneva when we responded decisively in response to interference in our elections, in response to the Russian Federation’s use of weapons of mass destruction against dissidents on foreign soil, for SolarWinds – that we would respond decisively, strongly in response to these types of activities. We have. The same is true if Russia continues its invasion of Ukraine. Same principle applies.

QUESTION: A separate question on a different subject, if I could ask a quick question about Iran?

MR PRICE: Okay. Any final questions on Russia/Ukraine before we move on?

QUESTION: Yes. Yes.

MR PRICE: Okay, please. Please.

QUESTION: On sanctions.

MR PRICE: Yes.

QUESTION: Today the Russian ambassador to Washington said that he doesn’t remember a single day that – when Russia lived without restrictions from the Western world. Putin proved he’s immune to sanctions. He has $600 billion in federal reserves. He has been in the driving seat making decisions to which the West is responding now and was responding since 2008. Are you thinking of a strategical approach to deal with this? You just said that they are trying to change the world order.

MR PRICE: So to the statement from the Russian Federation that they have been under sanctions since 2014, that is of course accurate. The sanctions that we have put in place and that we will continue to put in place are qualitatively different from any measures that the United States or any other country has imposed on the Russian Federation, including in 2014. So if they are comparing what they’ve been under now to what they will be under in – going forward if this invasion moves forward, that would be a profound miscalculation on their part.

When you talk about and think about the sanctions that we’ve already put in place, Nord Stream 2 is off the table. The Germans have taken decisive action. We have taken decisive action. That’s an $11 billion project that is now a piece of steel at the bottom of the ocean. We have, in lockstep with our allies, put in place blocking sanctions against the fifth-largest Russian financial institution. That’s $50 billion in assets. We’ve put in place blocking sanctions against another bank that funds the Ministry of Defense with some $35 billion in assets. In other words, these institutions can no longer make any transactions with the United States or with Europe, given Europe’s – the EU’s own corresponding actions in this regard.

Here’s the other point: With the authorities we have, with the intent we have, no Russian financial institution is safe if the invasion proceeds. As you heard from Daleep Singh yesterday, we are ready at the press of a button to take action against the two largest financial institutions in Russia. Together, these are institutions that hold three-quarters of a trillion dollars in assets, $750 billion in assets, half of the total Russian banking system. There are other measures and moves we have in store and that are ready if Russia continues with this invasion, including export controls, targeted sanctions against oligarchs and elites, and other measures.

So the Russians can depict these moves however they would like. I think it is noteworthy what we heard from our Ukrainian partners yesterday. You heard from Foreign Minister Kuleba as he was standing right next to Secretary Blinken here at the department. He said that, quote, “[W]e do appreciate…the sanctions which were announced today. They target Russia. They’re very specific. They are painful.”

QUESTION: (Off-mike.)

MR PRICE: Please. Please, go ahead. Yeah, Joel.

QUESTION: Thanks, Ned. I arrived with a couple questions of my own and have a couple follow-ups for this interesting conversation, from what you told my colleagues. First, do you think that China, given their desire for the world order that you just described, regards Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a step towards bringing that about?

MR PRICE: It is certainly not a step in the direction of the principle that the PRC claims to prize, and that is state sovereignty. You – I think everyone in this room is familiar with the position the PRC has taken in response to Russia’s aggression in Ukraine since 2014. I wouldn’t want to characterize that, but it suggests a level of deep unease.

So again, I would refer you to the PRC for any comment they might have on what Putin has in store, but if we are to judge the PRC based on what they have said consistently on the world stage in any number of fora, a direct assault on the sovereignty, on the territorial integrity of another state, that would not be consistent with what we’ve heard.

QUESTION: Yeah, I was just trying to clarify, because I thought I heard you say they’re – they’ve combined forces somehow.

MR PRICE: It was a reference to the burgeoning partnership that we’ve seen between these two countries over the course of many years now.

QUESTION: Okay. On Ukraine’s Plan B, fighting for every inch, Senator Risch, who is of course ranking on Foreign Relations and on Intelligence, or a senior member of the Intelligence Committee, has said that Russia could sweep across Ukraine pretty quickly, their first day would be their best day, they’d immediately face resistance movements. So I wonder, would the United States as a member of NATO either encourage or object to other NATO members offering this Ukrainian resistance cross-border safe haven?

MR PRICE: Countries are going to make their own sovereign decisions. We have in recent weeks, as you know, worked with a number of our NATO Allies to authorize them to provide U.S.-origin equipment to our Ukrainian partners – this is defensive security equipment – with an understanding that our Ukrainian partners need supplies, need materiel to defend themselves. The United States has provided them with this. We have – a number of our NATO Allies have done the same.

But when it comes to the decision that NATO Allies or other countries in Europe might make along those lines, I’d need to refer you there.

QUESTION: And I guess I wonder, do you see any lessons from Afghanistan for the kind of risk that we’re of course – when the Taliban could retire across the border to a place where they couldn’t be attacked, then that was difficult for a modern military to defeat.

MR PRICE: I – look, I would hesitate to make battlefield comparisons between two very different countries.

QUESTION: Finally, what I hope are truly a couple of quick ones. Those Nord Stream 2 sanctions, are those permanent or do you think that, like, the permanent punishment for this, that that’s gone, or do you regard that as something that could be lifted again later in exchange for de-escalation? And can we also get an answer to Foreign Minister Kuleba’s request for a Lend-Lease program? Do you expect that to proceed?

MR PRICE: Look, the fact is that sanctions are a means to an end. There is no sanction in any responsible sanctions program around the world that is permanent, and that is precisely because we don’t sanction countries just with the goal of enacting sanctions. This is not a policy to be purely punitive; this is a policy to change behavior. In this case, this is a policy to deter a further Russian invasion of Ukraine, to deter a war – a bloody, costly, devastating war that would take place on European soil and that would constitute the greatest threat to peace and security since the conclusion of World War II, certainly since the end of the Cold War.

QUESTION: Wait, so now the imposition of sanctions is a deterrent? I thought we just spent the last, like, couple months – you and the administration spent, like, the last couple months arguing that the threat of sanctions was the deterrent, and that if you imposed – that if you actually imposed them, then you would lose that deterrent.

MR PRICE: Matt, you’ve heard us say —

QUESTION: But you can’t have it both ways.

MR PRICE: We’re not having it both ways, Matt. You have heard us say very clearly, if Russia’s invasion escalates, if Russia’s actions escalate, so too will our response. We are prepared to enact an escalating series of measures against the Russian Federation if – unless – until and unless the Russian Federation changes course.

Said.

QUESTION: No Lend-Lease program?

QUESTION: Can I —

MR PRICE: So look, I don’t have any response to that, but – specific response to that, but I will make the point that this has not been Lend-Lease; this has a been a program of provision. We have provided our Ukrainian partners with, over the course of the last year, $650 million worth of defensive security assistance. We’re in a constant conversation and dialogue with our Ukrainian partners about their defensive security needs, and that will continue. As I mentioned before, if the Russian invasion continues, we will not only continue with that provision of security assistance, but we’ll double down on it.

Said.

QUESTION: Could I change topics? Just a very quick one on the Palestinian —

MR PRICE: Anything left on Russia-Ukraine?

QUESTION: I have on Ukraine.

QUESTION: Ukraine, Ukraine.

MR PRICE: In the very back, please.

QUESTION: Yes, sir. So – but you – we listened to the Russians also, and they present also, as they say, their legit security grievances. And it seems the West in a way or another did not reach any common – to which extent the U.S. and NATO now is really going into this offer of diplomacy? Where is the West going to give an in into the security demands from Putin?

MR PRICE: So this is something we’ve spoken to at great length. It’s actually something that we put in writing at some length. Subscribers of El País can see it with their own eyes. But we’ve been quite clear that there are some, quote/unquote, “demands” that the Russian Federation has put forward that are non-starters for us. The very principles that are at stake in terms of the rules-based international order, those are not negotiable. The idea that any other country can dictate the policy choices, whether foreign policy or domestic policy, of any other country – that is not something we’re going to negotiate. International borders, internationally recognized borders, sovereignty, the inviolability of borders – that is not something that is up for negotiation.

But what we – there are some areas that would improve our security, our own security environment, the security environment of the transatlantic community, and could address some of the stated security concerns of the Russian Federation. And we’ve delineated a series of those: discussions regarding the placement of offensive missiles in Europe; broader arms control protocols; protocols regarding stability and transparency; confidence-building measures. There are a number of areas that we think have the potential to be fruitful if we find a negotiating counterpart in the Russian Federation that operates in good faith. We have not found that yet, and I think at this stage those sort of broader areas may not take precedence to the first priority that we have, and that’s averting a bloody, costly, devastating war in Ukraine.

So I think our diplomacy going forward, at least for the foreseeable future, if, again, we find a counterpart in Moscow that is willing to sit down in good faith to discuss these issues in good faith, we are going to be very focused on saving lives, on preventing a war, on seeing to it that the plans Putin has set in motion over the course of many months now do not go forward.

Conor.

QUESTION: Two very quick ones on Trevor Reed and Paul Whelan. Do you have any indication that their cases are being treated separately from all this? Any concerns that the crisis would affect their detentions?

MR PRICE: We always treat the cases of U.S. hostages separate and apart from geopolitical issues and geopolitical dynamics. It remains an absolute priority for us to see the release of Paul Whelan and Trevor Reed, both of whom have been held unjustly, traveled to Russia as tourists, have been imprisoned on false charges that entire time. So it’s a priority of ours.

QUESTION: You do, but do you have any concern that the Russian Government would not?

MR PRICE: Again, human beings should not be held as pawns in terms of state-to-state relations. It is our priority to see them released, to do everything we can to achieve their release as quickly as we can.

QUESTION: And then secondly, do you have any new estimate of the number of Americans that would be in Ukraine at this moment in time?

MR PRICE: So as we’ve told you, late last year, October of last year, it was our assessment at the time that there were some 6,600 Americans who were resident in Ukraine. Now, that timeframe is important because the very month – October 2021 – that this assessment was last updated was the very month that we started urging Americans not to travel to Ukraine. In more recent weeks, as you know, we have been recommending and, even more recently, urging Americans to leave Ukraine.

So I think there is every expectation that the number of Americans who are resident in Ukraine late last year, October of last year, is far lower now than it was then. I can tell you procedurally we have been in repeated contact with Americans who remain in Ukraine. We have asked them to provide us with their contact information so that we can continue to be in communication with them to urge them to leave the country, to avail themselves of commercial and private options that continue to be available, and to provide any form of support that they may need in doing so, and that includes a repatriation loan if they’re not able to afford the return travel on their own.

When – in addition, we have provided specific guidance on overland crossings that Americans can take, providing specific recommendations about border crossings. We have been engaged in diplomacy with our Polish allies to see to it that Americans need not have any sort of advanced authorization to travel across the border. We’ve even established a welcome center across the Polish border to assist Americans should they need any assistance, whether it’s a passport application, whether it’s any form – other form of consular assistance.

Yes.

QUESTION: You just used the word “hostage” to describe Trevor Reed and Paul Whelan.

MR PRICE: They’re Americans who are unjustly detained.

QUESTION: So do you regard them as hostages? I haven’t heard that formulation before, but maybe I missed it.

MR PRICE: They are – they are Americans who are held unjustly against their will.

QUESTION: I know, but do you regard them as hostages?

MR PRICE: I – we’ll get back to you if there’s a – if – on that. i

Yes.

QUESTION: (Inaudible) about Latin America, the fact that Putin is looking for new partners in Latin America – for example, Argentina, Brazil. What’s the position of the State Department? And do you think this is a way to increase the pressure on the United States, talking about the close relationship of United States with Latin America?

MR PRICE: Well, it goes back to what we were discussing before, and this is the fact that what we are seeing is autocracies around the world band together, and we’ve seen in some ways Russia at the vanguard of this activity. When it comes to their motives or intentions, that’s not something I would want to speak to from here. I would refer you to the – to Moscow to speak to their own foreign policy decisions. But we have certainly seen Moscow reach out to some of the most repressive, autocratic, undemocratic governments in this hemisphere. That includes Nicaragua. That includes Cuba. That includes Venezuela.

Yes, Said.

QUESTION: Thank you. I want to move to the Palestinian issue and I have a quick one on Iran. On the Palestinian issue —

QUESTION: (Off-mike.)

QUESTION: Yeah, okay. Yeah. On the Palestinian issue, I know I have asked in this room many times before on your position regarding the practice of administrative detentions by Israel, to which all Palestinians at one time or another probably experience. There is one particular case, a 14-year-old boy who has been falsely accused. One Israeli judge after Israeli judge threw it out of court, but the authorities keep him in prison. They keep renewing this. He has a neuromuscular disease. He might die in prison. Will the United States call on Israel to quit this practice, especially against children who have not – who have been found innocent by their own judicial system?

MR PRICE: Said, you’ve heard this from us before, but we urge —

QUESTION: And the boy’s name, by the way, is just, for the record, Amal Nakhleh.

MR PRICE: We urge the full respect for human rights in Israel and the West Bank and Gaza. As we’ve said many times, Palestinians and Israelis alike equally deserve to live safely and securely, to enjoy equal measures of freedom, of security, of prosperity.

QUESTION: With all due respect, the Palestinians do not arrest Israelis and put them under administrative detention.

MR PRICE: Said, we – and again, you have heard this from us before, but we continue to elevate the role of human rights in our foreign relations and to encourage, to your question, legal reforms that advance respect for human rights of all individuals.

QUESTION: My second question also pertains to the holding of dead Palestinians, killed Palestinians, those who have been killed by the Israeli soldiers for years on end. Is that the – is that a form of collective punishment? Does the – does this administration view this as a collective punishment?

MR PRICE: We have stressed to Israel both publicly as well as privately our strong hope that any measures that Israel takes would be designed to avoid further escalating tensions and to take into consideration the impact of any such measures on the Palestinian people.

QUESTION: And lastly, on Iran, should we expect some sort of a deal or returning to a deal over the next few days, as was suggested?

MR PRICE: Well, you’ve heard this from my colleagues, but there has been significant progress, and we are close to a possible deal, but at the same time, a number of very difficult issues remain unresolved. What we know is that there is very little time remaining to reach a deal, to resolve these remaining issues given the pace of Iran’s nuclear advances. You’ve heard us say this before, but it remains true that even as we are narrowing the set of issues we’re discussing, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.

If Iran shows seriousness, if it demonstrates serious of purpose in Vienna, we believe that we can and should reach an understanding on a potential mutual return to compliance in short order, potentially within days. But anything much beyond that, if this were to drag on any longer than that, would put the possibility of return to the deal at grave and profound risk.

Andrea.

QUESTION: (Inaudible) issues, whether they involve equipment, centrifuges, compliance, verification? Broad categories, Ned.

MR PRICE: I really can’t, and that is primarily because we are at this decisive stage where it is incumbent on the Iranians and all parties to do everything we can to narrow those differences. We’re going to be a little bit more circumspect at this especially sensitive period, but again, if the Iranians demonstrate seriousness of purpose, we believe that we can achieve an understanding in relatively short order.

QUESTION: (Inaudible) anything more on travel?

MR PRICE: On travel?

QUESTION: By the Secretary.

MR PRICE: Oh, by the Secretary. We – look, we do not have any travel to announce or to preview at this time. The Secretary has been working the phones. He has been on with Josep Borrell of the EU today. He spoke to his British counterpart, Elizabeth Truss, earlier today as well. And I expect you will see him continue to engage with his counterparts around the world.

Yes.

QUESTION: On Yemen, we saw the designations today, and in the statement you said they are intensifying the humanitarian crisis. When you removed them last year from the terrorist organization list, you said you did that for humanitarian purposes. Is the State Department – my first question: Is the State Department objecting designating them as a terrorist organization?

MR PRICE: So as you know, there’s a review underway regarding that very question, so I’m not in a position to speak to it in any great detail. What I can say is that we have a number of tools at our disposal, including the tools we use today in mounting sanctions and designations against these Houthi-affiliated individuals and entities, that can hold the Houthis accountable for their reprehensible behavior. We are committed to doing so; we will continue to do so. We will use every appropriate tool to hold accountable those Houthi leaders who are responsible for the terrorist attacks for – against our partners in the region, for the violence in Yemen itself, for the humanitarian emergency, which by many estimations is now the world’s worst humanitarian catastrophe with some 16 million people who are suffering from food insecurity and malnutrition.

So we are committed to doing everything we can to bring this conflict to an end, knowing that only through a diplomatic resolution will we be able to, on a sustainable basis, calm the violence, ease the humanitarian suffering of the Yemeni people, and mitigate the threat that the United States and our partners face from the Houthis, including in the context of these attacks.

QUESTION: On Iran, do we expect anything regarding the detainees ahead of the deal?

MR PRICE: Again, this is an issue that is of the utmost importance to the United States. At every single opportunity, we make the release of Americans, of other third-country nationals, a priority of ours. We have been clear that the nuclear negotiations in Vienna and our efforts to see our unjustly detained citizens released, these operate on separate tracks precisely because a potential return to the JCPOA has always, at best, been an uncertain proposition, and we want the release of our citizens to be a certain proposition.

So we have not explicitly tied our Americans – tied these individuals, these detainees to progress in the nuclear talks. But as Rob Malley has made clear, it is – certainly it colors our engagement in Vienna and elsewhere knowing that this is a government that is unjustly detaining Americans and other third-country nationals.

So in every other context we’re doing this, but certainly in the case of Iran we’re making every effort to see our Americans, to see other third-country nationals released just as quickly as possible.

QUESTION: Back on Yemen and the Houthis.

MR PRICE: Mm-hmm.

QUESTION: And I realize that a lot of people probably think this is just a semantic thing, so I’ll keep it short, but the – these designations were made under an executive order that is a counterterrorism executive order. And you – in the Secretary’s statement and in the Treasury’s statement, it refers to the Houthis committing terrorist acts, but it doesn’t identify them as terrorists. And the EO – they’re being used – they’re being designated under a counterterrorism EO simply because of their affiliation with the IRGC Qods Force, which is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization.

So my question is: Do you believe that the Houthis as a group are terrorists? You say that – you’ve designated them under a counterterrorism executive order. You accused them of staging, launching terrorist attacks. But you won’t call them terrorists. Why not?

MR PRICE: Matt, so this is a question that’s based on semantics, but we’ve been very clear that —

QUESTION: Well, and —

MR PRICE: — that the Houthis have launched reprehensible terrorist attacks —

QUESTION: Yes.

MR PRICE: — against our partners in the region. These may be attacks that are targeting our partners, but these types of operations have the potential not only to harm citizens of Saudi Arabia, citizens of the United Arab Emirates, but Americans —

QUESTION: Yes. Yes.

MR PRICE: — who may be in the region as well. So we have been very clear that these are terrorist attacks.

QUESTION: Yeah, but you’re not saying that the Houthis themselves are terrorists, and I’m just wondering why. And yes, it’s a semantic argument, but I’m just looking at a statement that came out from Senator Murphy and a bunch of his colleagues urging you not to reinstate the Foreign Terrorist Organization designation against the Houthis. So – because it would cause grave damage and economic – humanitarian – even worse humanitarian disaster. But yet, today you have designated these individuals and entities under a counterterrorism executive order and accused them of committing terrorist attacks. So what’s the problem? Why can’t you identify the Houthis as terrorists?

MR PRICE: It is completely consistent that a certain label and a certain authority – in this case, the FTO – not be applied to a group that can commit terrorist attacks. There are any number of examples of groups that aren’t FTOs that you know well that have committed, over the course of years, consistent terrorist attacks. This is a question of semantics. This is a question of legal authorities.

QUESTION: So what – well, it’s a question of political will, right? Or —

MR PRICE: It is a question of us demonstrating that we have a number of tools and a number of authorities to hold Houthi leaders and others affiliated with this movement accountable for their reprehensible actions —

QUESTION: Okay.

MR PRICE: — including the terrorist attacks that they’ve undertaken in recent days against our partners in the region.

QUESTION: Okay. Can you give me an example of a group that has been committing terrorist attacks for decades that has not been labeled an FTO?

MR PRICE: Matt, I think there are a number of examples. You could look at the Taliban as a group that is not an FTO that I think you would probably agree has committed terrorist attacks.

Thank you all very much.

(The briefing was concluded at 3:24 p.m.)

i Paul Whelan and Trevor Reed are not officially categorized as hostages. We continue to be deeply concerned over their treatment. Both men traveled to Russia as tourists, were arrested, and were then convicted without credible evidence.

5,bb36ff46-5eef-48a1-87b9-577399002244,['Silvia Resende'],,"The last few years have been marked by a great increase in global mobility. The rapid digital transformation, with greater access to information, faster internet, the possibility to work or study remotely, as well as an improvement in communications and transport, has made the desire to live in another country, temporarily or even permanently, increasingly common. For those who live in big cities and are used to a high cost of living, the idea may be even more tempting. Especially if it is possible to maintain the salaries of the country of origin, and spend less in the chosen destination. And why not?

Based on the Numbeo website, a kind of Wikipedia of prices around the world, it is possible to assess how much your salary could be worth if you decide to live in Portugal. And even though it may seem low for your country's standards, it will certainly be enough and even worth more in Portuguese lands, ensuring a good quality of life.

Live better. For less.

With how much money can I live well in Portugal? This is a question that will depend a lot on the city you will choose to live in, your lifestyle and the number of people in your family. Portugal has one of the lowest minimum wages in Europe (705€), and also because of this, living in the country is not that expensive.

Generally speaking, it is said that a couple can live comfortably in Lisbon on 1,500 to 2,000 euros per month. A good part of this amount will be spent on housing, so the choice of where to live will make all the difference in the budget. Tourist places and big metropolises like Lisbon and Porto are more expensive regions. On the other hand, it is possible to spend less, even living in areas close to these cities. Therefore, it is always good to plan based on your needs and the city you choose to call home.

Comparing the cost of living: Lisbon x San Francisco x New York

To arrive at more realistic figures, we chose two important American cities to compare prices with the Portuguese capital: San Francisco, CA and New York, NY. According to the website numbeo.com, a person earning $3,017 a month in San Francisco could maintain the same standard of living with just $1,250 in Lisbon. That, assuming the cost of rent in both cities. This calculation assumes net earnings, that is, after income tax. In New York, on the other hand, a salary of around $3,000 would be necessary to maintain the standard of living achieved in Lisbon with less than half of this value.

It should be noted that Lisbon is the city with the highest cost of living in Portugal. It is possible to live in other cities and spend less. Porto, the second most important city in the country, has a cost of living 11% lower than Lisbon. Braga, another example, has a cost of living 19% lower than the capital. Those who prefer to live in less densely populated areas will pay even less and still enjoy the quality of life offered in Portugal.

How much does a villa in Lisbon cost?

Housing is one of the items that weighs the most on the budget, so it must be analysed individually. According to Numbeo, the monthly rent for a 3-bedroom flat in downtown New York City is valued at $6,500. In San Francisco, the value is similar: $6,850. In Lisbon, the same type of property can be rented for $1,850, about 70% less.

If the option is not to rent but to buy a property, the flats located in downtown Lisbon cost on average 63% less than in the two American cities. The value of the square meter in Lisbon is valued at $5,330, against $15,340 in New York, and $13,152 in San Francisco.

Education costs in Lisbon

Education is something that is highly valued when choosing a new city to live in. In Portugal, education costs much less than in American cities. Tuition fees in public schools for children up to 5 years old can cost up to 81% less in Lisbon than in San Francisco and New York. It is worth noting that education up to the 12th grade is compulsory and offered free of charge in the country. And many of the public schools stand out in national rankings, with scores similar to those of public schools.

In the case of university education, this difference in values may be even greater. It is worth noting that Portuguese universities, even public ones, are not free. Even so, undergraduate courses in Portugal have attractive prices for foreigners. The average cost of a degree at the University of Lisbon is $980 per year for local students and around $7,900 for international students. It is worth remembering that foreigners who live legally in Portugal for 5 years may apply for citizenship and enjoy cheaper tuition fees at these institutions.

Despite still being one of the poorest countries in Europe, Portugal has obtained excellent results in international evaluations of education such as PISA, aimed at students up to 15 years old, being the only country of the continent that improves its performance every year. In addition, 7 Portuguese universities are in the list of the 1,300 best universities on the planet according to the QS World University Ranking. The University of Porto is among the 300 best in the world.

Is healthcare in Portugal cheaper than in the United States?

Yes, for sure!

In the United States, health care is a very expensive item, generally speaking. The country does not have a single healthcare system, but rather a variety of independent programmes, autonomously regulated by the 50 federal units and sponsored by the market. Popular health insurances such as Medicaid and ACA (Affordable Care Act) do not cover the entire population and their services leave much to be desired. According to Health Markets, the average monthly cost of private health insurance in California is $430, and generally does not cover all expenses. Insurance in New York is among the most expensive in the country, with monthly premiums of around $700 and high deductibles.

How much does healthcare cost in Portugal?

In Lisbon, private health insurance costs around $100, depending on the age of the patient and the type of coverage desired. Generally speaking, these insurances require their users to pay a percentage of the expenses for consultations and hospitalization. Something around 20% of the total expense. A consultation with a specialist doctor costs on average $80.

Portugal also offers quality public medical care through the National Health System. The system is universal, but not totally free. There are moderate fees to prevent overuse, but they are small. For a general medicine consultation, for example, the fee is $5. Moreover, many citizens are exempt from this payment, such as the unemployed, pregnant women, blood donors, transplant patients, children under 17 years old, among others. In Portugal, 93% of those enrolled in the SNS have a family doctor. The government also has medicine subsidy programs, in which the State pays part of the amount and the user pays the rest. There are 4 co-payment scales, varying from 90% to 15% of the value of the medicine.

According to the most recent Euro Health Consumer Index, Portugal is in 13th place in the ranking of European health systems. It is important to note that foreigners who live legally in Portugal can also benefit from the public health system.

Food costs in Lisbon

Food is also cheaper in the European city; whether it is groceries bought at the supermarket or meals taken in restaurants. Meals in Lisbon restaurants cost, on average, 50% less than in New York and 46% less than in San Francisco.

Even maintaining vices can be more economical in the Portuguese capital, with cigarettes and beer at more attractive prices. Average price of a half-litre of ordinary beer in Lisbon? Only $2.50, against $7 in San Francisco and $8 in New York. Marlboro cigarettes? In Lisbon, $5.75, against $15 charged in NY and $11.34 in San Francisco.

Transport and fuel prices in Lisbon

There are few items that cost more in Lisbon. A litre of petrol currently costs $1.90 in the Portuguese capital, 60% more than in San Francisco and 136% more than in New York. The value of a car is also higher in Portugal: a model equivalent to a Golf 1.4 90kw costs on average $29,300 in Lisbon, against $25,000 in NY and $24,000 thousand in San Francisco.

Nevertheless, the underground ticket in Lisbon costs $1.70, which is less than in New York ($2.75) and San Francisco ($2.50). It is worth noting that public transport in Portugal is of high quality, being widely used by citizens from all social classes, including those who have their own vehicle.

Leisure

There's no quality of life without good leisure options, and there's no shortage of them in Lisbon. Besides being able to enjoy its cultural wealth, with its centuries-old monuments, churches of singular beauty, and sunny beaches, the Portuguese capital also has good options in theater, music, festivals... And with an affordable cost as you can see, taking as a basis the value of a movie ticket: in Lisbon it costs around $8, against $17 in NY and $15 in San Francisco.

What is the average salary in Lisbon?

On average, salaries in San Francisco and New York are four to five times higher than in Lisbon. While the average salary in the Portuguese capital is $1,200, in New York that figure is close to $6,000, while in San Francisco it's almost $8,000. Have you ever thought of spending a salary like that in a Portuguese city? It's no wonder that many Americans have been looking to Portugal to live. The country has already been considered the best destination in the world for remote work, according to travel website Momondo. It is also on the list of the best destinations to enjoy retirement, occupying the 4th position in the ""2022 Annual Global Retirement Index"". In addition, Portugal is the 7th country in the world with the best English proficiency, according to the ""EF English Proficiency Index"" ranking of 2021, which makes life much easier for Americans who do not master the Portuguese language.

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. House overwhelmingly approved legislation that would ban Russian oil imports to the United States, an effort to put into law the restrictions announced by President Joe Biden in response to the escalating war in Ukraine.

Going further than Biden’s import ban on Russian oil, the bill making its way through Congress would also encourage a review of Russia’s status in the World Trade Organization and signal U.S. support for sanctions on Russian officials over human rights violations, as the U.S. works to economically isolate the regime.

Lawmakers in both parties have been eager to act, willing to risk higher gas prices at home in order to support Ukraine with a show of U.S. bipartisanship. The legislation was approved Wednesday, 414-17, and now goes to the Senate.

Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, who helped draft the bill, acknowledged it may cost more to fill up tanks at home to stop Russian President Vladimir Putin’s tanks abroad.

“It is one way to demonstrate our solidarity,” Doggett said during the debate.

TOKYO — Japanese electronics and entertainment giant Sony is suspending all shipments of its PlayStation video game consoles as well as game software to Russia because of the war in Ukraine.

Launch of “Gran Turismo 7,” a popular racing car game, is being suspended, and the PlayStation store in Russia will close, Sony Interactive Entertainment said in a statement Thursday.

The company “joins the global community in calling for peace in Ukraine,” it said.

Sony, which has movies and music businesses, earlier said it’s halted theatrical releases of its movies in Russia. Sony Group Corp. has also announced US$2 million in humanitarian aid to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the international aid group Save the Children to help war victims.

TOKYO — Japanese machinery and technology company Hitachi Group is suspending exports to Russia and has temporarily stopped manufacturing there.

Hitachi said Thursday products and services related to electric power equipment “indispensable to the daily lives of people” will continue. Operations in Ukraine have resumed by moving employees and families to safer areas, it said.

“Hitachi Group considers the safety and health of all employees and their families as its top priority. In Ukraine, the company is engaged in various activities to realize this goal and hopes that peace will return as soon as possible,” it said.

IRPIN, Ukraine — Hundreds of Ukrainians living in towns occupied by Russian troops on the outskirts of Kyiv fled Wednesday.

Streams of cars -- some fixed with white flags -- filed down the road, joined by lines of yellow buses marked with red crosses.

The Interior Ministry said about 700 people were evacuated from Vorzel and Irpin. People from three other Kyiv suburbs were unable to leave. Some who managed to get out said they hadn’t eaten in days.

“I forgot when I ate last,” said an Irpin resident who gave only her first name, Olena. “I’m so scared. I need to keep walking.”

Iuliia Bushinska, a Vorzel resident, said: “Occupiers came to our house and they were ready to shoot us.""

""They took away our house, our car, they took away our documents. So we need to start our life from the beginning. We survived things that I never experienced in my life,” Bushinska said.

WASHINGTON — The U.S. government publicly warned that Russia might seek to use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, after Russia, without evidence, accused Ukraine of having chemical weapons labs.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki called Russia’s claim “preposterous” and said it could be part of an attempt by Russia to lay the groundwork for using such weapons of mass destruction against Ukraine itself.

“This is all an obvious ploy by Russia to try to try to justify its further premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified attack on Ukraine,” said Psaki.

“Now that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them.”

Russia has used chemical weapons before in carrying out assassination attempts against Putin enemies like Alexey Navalny and former spy Sergei Skripal. It also supports the Assad government in Syria which has used chemical weapons against its people in a decade-long civil war.

LVIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called on the West to impose even tougher sanctions on Russia after the airstrike on the maternity hospital in Mariupol.

“A genocide of Ukrainians is taking place,” Zelensky said Wednesday in his daily late evening video address to the nation. Wearing his now traditional wartime army green, he said the West should strengthen the sanctions so Russia “no longer has any possibility to continue this genocide.”

He said 17 people were injured in the attack, including pregnant women.

Mariupol has been blockaded by Russian troops for nine days. City officials said Wednesday that about 1,200 residents have been killed.

Zelensky again called on Western leaders to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine, something NATO members have refused to do for fear of provoking a wider war with Russia. Short of that, Zelensky called for the delivery of more fighter jets to Ukraine, a proposal the Pentagon rejected on Wednesday.

Zelensky said about 35,000 civilians have used humanitarian corridors to flee to western Ukraine to escape the fighting.

NEW YORK — Wall Street titan Citigroup said it would wind down its Russian banking business, with the ultimate goal of finding a seller. But the bank also acknowledged that selling the business may be difficult due to the Russian economy “being disconnected from the global financial system.”

Citigroup had a robust presence in Russia for several years, operating branches in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other major Russian cities. The company also did investment banking and business banking in the region.

Until the business is sold, Citi said it is “operating the business on a more limited basis” and is helping its U.S. and other corporate clients unwind or suspend their businesses in Russia.

Weeks before Russia invaded, Citi had announced it was leaving several Asian markets including Russia as part of a company-wide strategic review of its major markets. Citi is probably the most global of the Wall Street banks, operating consumer banking franchises in Asia, Latin America and Europe.

WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon slammed the door Wednesday on any plans to provide MiG fighter jets to Ukraine, even through a second country, calling it a ""high-risk"" venture that would not significantly change the Ukrainian Air Force's effectiveness.

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Polish counterpart on Wednesday and told him the U.S. assessment. He said the U.S. is pursuing other options that would provide more critical military needs to Ukraine such as air defence and anti-armor weapons systems.

Poland had said it was prepared to hand over MiG-29 planes to NATO that could then be delivered to Ukraine, but Kirby said U.S. intelligence concluded that it could trigger a ""significant"" Russian reaction.

LVIV, Ukraine -- Russian aircraft bombed Zhytomyr on Wednesday evening, while artillery fire continued pounding the suburbs of Kyiv and Kharkiv, the country's second largest city.

In Zhytomyr, a city of 260,000 to the west of Kyiv, bombs fell on two hospitals, one of them a children's hospital, Mayor Serhii Sukhomlyn said on Facebook. He said the number of casualties was still being determined.

""Oh, this is a hot night,"" he said in a video address to city residents. ""Russia understands that it is losing strategically, but we have to hold out.""

Russian artillery shelled Kharkiv, destroying a police headquarters, killing at least four people and wounding 15, prosecutors office representative Serhii Bolvinov said on Facebook. He said since the invasion began nearly two weeks ago, 282 city residents have been killed, including six children.

After darkness fell, Russian artillery again began shelling Kyiv suburbs.

""Russian troops are methodically turning our life into a hell. People day and night have to sit underground without food, water or electricity,"" the head of the Kyiv region, Oleksiy Kuleba, said on Ukrainian television.

UNITED NATIONS -- The United Nations has received official notification from Ukraine that it intends to withdraw about 250 troops serving in the UN peacekeeping mission in Congo as well as military equipment, including some aircraft.

UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric confirmed the withdrawal on Wednesday stressing that every country has a right to withdraw military forces contributed to peacekeeping operations. He acknowledged ""the tremendous role Ukraine has played, especially on issues of transport and helicopters.""

Dujarric said it is up to the Ukrainian government to explain why it asked to pull out the troops and the UN will be contacting other countries to replace the troops and equipment in the Congo mission known as MONUSCO which has about 17,800 personnel.

The UN spokesman said Ukrainians remain present in smaller numbers in other UN peacekeeping missions -- 13 in South Sudan, 12 in Mali, five in Cyprus, four in Abyei and three in the UN political mission in Kosovo.

WASHINGTON -- U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that President Volodymr Zelensky has told her that it will take ""everybody's help"" in rebuilding Ukraine after the war with Russia.

Pelosi said she had a more than 45 minute call Wednesday with Zelensky. She said the Ukrainian president again asked for U.S. help in sending warplanes, anti-aircraft missiles and tanks to fight the Russian invasion.

But Pelosi said Zelensky also told her: ""We're going to need everybody's help in rebuilding Ukraine as soon as we end this war.""

Pelosi said she hopes the U.S. can help facilitate the transfer of Soviet-era MiG fighter planes that Ukraine has requested from neighbouring NATO allies. But she noted there's a school of thought that suggests anti-aircraft missiles could also help Ukraine in its fight against Russia.

The Pentagon has rejected the idea of sending any fighter jets to Ukraine.

UNITED NATIONS -- Russia's ""illegal, unprovoked"" and ""cruel"" war against Ukraine is underscoring the many different ways in which peace, security and a stable climate are linked, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said Wednesday.

Kerry told an informal UN Security Council meeting on Climate Finance for Sustaining Peace that ""the crisis in Ukraine really does underscore the risks that we face in the current volatile and uncertain energy markets.""

The U.S. special presidential envoy for climate said in a virtual speech that ""Russia has attacked a nuclear facility in Ukraine, dangerous in and of itself, risky.""

There was increasing concern Wednesday over the safety of the decommissioned Chornobyl nuclear plant, which Russian troops seized early in the invasion and which lost power and had to revert to backup generators. And there is also concern about the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the largest in Europe, which Russia seized last week.

The United States is responding by banning the import of Russian oil, liquefied natural gas and coal, ""and many other nations are now rethinking their reliance on Russian energy sources,"" Kerry said. The ""instability, conflict, death destruction"" in Ukraine is happening in the context of ""a global existential crisis"" of global warming that scientists have warned about for decades, he said.

""We are actually living through the consequences of that crisis,"" Kerry said.

WASHINGTON -- The United Arab Emirates said Wednesday it will urge OPEC to consider boosting oil output.

The announcement followed a U.S. ban on imports of Russian oil, the latest in a series of sanctions designed to punish Russia for the war in Ukraine. Oil prices have risen sharply since Russia -- the world's third-largest oil producer -- invaded Ukraine late last month.

""We favour production increases and will be encouraging OPEC to consider higher production levels,"" UAE's ambassador to the United States, Yousef Al Otaiba, said in a statement posted on his embassy's website. He said his country believes that stability in energy markets is critical to the global economy.

The UAE is a longtime member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which last week, along with its oil-producing allies including Russia, said it was sticking to its plan to gradually increase oil production rather that opening the spigots further.

The UAE was the world's seventh-largest oil producing nation in 2020, according to U.S. Department of Energy figures published in December of last year.

Oil prices surged Tuesday after President Joe Biden announced the U.S. ban on Russian oil. But the possibility of increased OPEC output helped send prices tumbling Wednesday. A barrel of U.S. crude oil dropped 11% to US$110.12.

BERLIN -- The head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog said he will travel to Antalya in Turkey on Thursday at the invitation of Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu as concerns rise over the security of Ukraine's nuclear reactors.

Cavusoglu will host a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers in Antalya as the two-week-long war in Ukraine claims more victims. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi tweeted Wednesday evening that he will attend meetings and hopes ""to make progress on the urgent issue of ensuring the safety and security of .Ukraine's nuclear facilities. We need to act now!""

At the invitation of #Turkey’s Foreign Minister @MevlutCavusoglu I will travel tomorrow to Antalya. In meetings there I hope to make progress on the urgent issue of ensuring the safety and security of #Ukraine’s nuclear facilities. We need to act now! — Rafael MarianoGrossi (@rafaelmgrossi) March 9, 2022

Concerns rose Wednesday over the safety of the decommissioned Chornobyl nuclear plant, which Russian troops seized early in the invasion and which lost power and had to revert to backup generators. The state communications agency said the power outage could put systems for cooling nuclear material at risk. The site has been under control of Russian troops since last week.

Ukraine's nuclear regulator said remote data transmission from monitoring systems at Chornobyl has been lost.

The Vienna-based UN nuclear watchdog said it saw no critical impact on safety at Chornobyl because there could be ""effective heat removal without need for electrical supply"" from spent nuclear fuel at the site.

SEATTLE -- Amazon said it will suspend shipments of products sold on its website to customers based in Russia and Belarus.

The e-commerce giant said late Tuesday in a blog update on its website that it will also suspend Prime Video access for customers based in Russia and will stop taking orders for New World, the only video game the company says it sells directly in the Russia. The retailer added new Russia and Belarus-based third-party sellers won't be able to sell on its site.

The retailer had said earlier in the day that its cloud computing network, Amazon Web Services, will also stop allowing new sign-ups in Russia and Belarus. Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov had called on the company to stop providing AWS in Russia, suggesting in a letter sent to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos that not doing so could be supporting ""bloodshed and disinformation that can be leveraged through digital infrastructures.""

WASHINGTON - U.S. gasoline prices hit another record on Wednesday, with the national average rising to US$4.25 a gallon, an overnight increase of eight cents, according to the AAA auto club.

Motorists in California continue to pay the highest prices, with the statewide average at $5.57 a gallon. Prices topped $4.50 in Illinois, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Alaska and Hawaii.

Gasoline prices have been rising for nearly two years, following the trend in oil prices. Production fell at the outset of the pandemic, and producers have not pumped enough oil since then to meet rising demand.

The national average for gas has spiked 60 cents in just the past week, which analysts say is almost entirely due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which led President Joe Biden to announce Tuesday that the U.S. will ban the import of Russian oil.

WASHINGTON - The Pentagon said Wednesday that two U.S. Army Patriot air defence batteries have been shifted from Germany to Poland as a precautionary defensive move.

TIRANA, Albania - The U.S. Special Operations Command Europe, or SOCEUR, opened its forward-based headquarters in Albania on Wednesday, aiming at enhancing regional stability, its head Maj. Gen. David Tabor said.

A 12- to 15-member Task Force Balkans group will be based in Tirana to coordinate joint and combined exchange training and civil military support element engagements, Tabor said. Tabor said Albania's central location in the Balkans was behind the decision to open the command there, he said.

It will be the first-ever U.S. permanent military presence in Albania, said U.S. Ambassador in Tirana Yuri Kim.

Albanian senior officials said that opening such a U.S. military office is more important now.

The opening of the command in Tirana “came at the proper moment, at the culmination of the insecurity due to the gloomy situation in the continent after Russian aggression,” said Defence Minister Niko Peleshi.

PRAGUE - The Czech government has agreed to give refugees from Ukraine free access to the labour market without any work permit.

Labour and Social Affairs Minister Marian Jurecka said Wednesday that the refugees will be in a position “of any other citizen” if they want to get a job.

The refugees will only need to get a visa for their stay in the Czech Republic to work. Assistance centres in all regions of the Czech Republic are working around the clock to provide all necessary documents and other initial help, including housing, to the refugees.

It's estimated some 150,000 people have arrived in the country that doesn't border Ukraine invaded by the Russian troops.

Jurecka said there are some 350,000 jobs currently available in the Czech Republic.

The government also approved a plan to give all the refugees a financial contribution of US$215 on arrival. They would be able to receive it monthly six times if needed.

NICOSIA, Cyprus - Cyprus said the first 165-ton batch of humanitarian aid for the people of Ukraine has been shipped to Poland via the Greek port city of Thesaloniki.

The foreign ministry said in a statement Wednesday that the shipment will reach a European Union logistics hub set up in conjunction with Polish authorities.

The aid - collected mainly from individual donations - includes 88 tons of foodstuffs, sleeping bags, tents blankets and portable toilets, 5,000 pairs of shoes, bottled water, an electricity generator, personal hygiene kits and 14 tons of medical supplies.

The aid is a “tangible demonstration of the solidarity of Cyprus to the Ukrainian people,” the ministry said. Freight costs were covered by the ministry.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed Ukrainian “nationalists” for hampering the evacuation of civilians from besieged Ukrainian cities.

The Kremlin said that Putin discussed the situation in Ukraine in Wednesday's phone call with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, with a “special emphasis given to the humanitarian aspects.” It said that Putin told Scholz about Russian “efforts to organize humanitarian corridors for civilians to exit areas of fighting and attempts by militants from nationalist units to hamper safe evacuation of people.”

Ukrainian officials said that the continuous Russian shelling has derailed efforts to evacuate civilians from areas affected by fighting.

LONDON - British American Tobacco said it has suspended all planned capital investment in Russia but continues to operate there, even as many other Western brands announce they're halting all business in the country because of the Ukraine invasion.

The company, one of the so-called Big Four tobacco producers, said Wednesday that it has a “duty of care” to all its 2,500 employees in Russia. BAT said it's focusing on its locally produced tobacco products in Russia, where it has substantial manufacturing and has been operating since 1991.

“Furthermore, we are scaling our business activities appropriate to the current situation, including rationalising our marketing activities,” the company said, adding it's complying with all international sanctions related to the conflict.

The company said it is “deeply concerned about the conflict in Ukraine,” where it employs 1,000 people and has suspended all business and manufacturing.

In contrast, another major tobacco producer, Imperial Brands, said earlier Wednesday it would halt all operations in Russia, including production at its factory in Volgograd and ceasing all sales and marketing activity.

Separately, S&P Global Ratings said it has suspended commercial operations in Russia. The credit rating agency said it would maintain analytical coverage from outside Russia.

GENEVA -- The international Red Cross says civilians caught up in places affected by fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces should have ""broader relocation alternatives"" for evacuation -- including to other parts of Ukraine -- beyond the Russian government's offer to take them into Russian territory.

The International Committee of the Red Cross, which in particular is trying to arrange evacuations of civilians from the hard-hit port city of Mariupol, made the comments Wednesday after Russia offered in recent days to allow safe-passage corridors for Ukrainian civilians across the Russian border. Ukrainian authorities have rejected that idea.

ICRC has said authorities on both sides need to agree on any evacuation plan, and evacuations should be voluntary for the civilians concerned.

Some civilians might refuse evacuation ""if the only escape route available to them implies resettling in the Russian Federation or the Republic of Belarus,"" said ICRC spokesman Jason Straziuso in an email, referring to Russian ally Belarus. ""In the view of the ICRC, civilians affected by the hostilities should be given broader relocation alternatives, including within Ukraine itself.""

NEW YORK -- Russia has admitted that conscript soldiers have been sent into Ukraine and that some have been captured by Ukrainian troops.

The admission comes after President Vladimir Putin vowed that conscripts would not be deployed and that Russian forces would rely on professional troops.

Defence Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said that ""unfortunately there have been detected several instances of the presence of conscript-service military personnel"" with units in Ukraine but that ""almost all"" of them had been recalled to Russia.

He added that some conscripts were taken prisoner by Ukrainian forces while serving in a logistics unit and efforts are under way to free them. Konashenkov didn't specify how many conscripts had served in Ukraine or how many were captured.

LONDON -- Ukraine's ambassador to Britain has urged the government to suspend visa requirements for Ukrainians fleeing the war, after the U.K. acknowledged fewer than 1,000 visas have been handed out so far.

Vadym Prystaiko told lawmakers that ""if you can vote for some temporary releasing of us from these rules, to allow people to get here, we will take care of (them).""

Britain's Conservative government says it is prepared to take in hundreds of thousands of refugees from Ukraine. But as of Wednesday the number of visas issued was just below 1,000.

European Union nations are allowing Ukrainians to live and work for up to three years without having to go through a formal asylum-seeking process. The U.K., which left the bloc last year, isn't waiving the paperwork, saying applicants must submit biometric data for security reasons.

Ukrainians arriving at the English Channel port of Calais have been told to apply at British missions in Paris or Brussels, while others say they are waiting days for appointments at U.K. embassies in eastern Europe.

The British government says it is setting up a new visa centre in Lille, northwest France, that will start work on Thursday.

ROME -- Italy will let refugees arriving from Ukraine who have applied for a residency permit to work, either for employers or in self-employment, including seasonal work.

The existing quotas for foreign workers based on nationalities will be lifted for the Ukrainians fleeing the war in their homeland, Premier Mario Draghi told lawmakers.

As of Wednesday, nearly 24,000 Ukrainians fleeing the war had arrived in Italy, mainly through the Italian border with Slovenia. Of those, 9,700 are minors.

All the refugees will be required to either be vaccinated against COVID-19 if they aren't already or take a swab test every 48 hours. In Italy, those 5 years and older can be vaccinated against COVID-19.

In terms of integration measures, children will be able to attend Italian schools. Draghi cautioned Italians to keep in mind that measures for the refugees will be needed not for days or months but ""perhaps for far longer.""

GENEVA -- The World Health Organization says it has documented 18 attacks on health facilities, workers and ambulances since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began.

At a press briefing on Wednesday, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the UN health agency has delivered 81 metric tons of supplies to Ukraine and is now establishing a pipeline to send further equipment. To date, Tedros said WHO had sent enough surgical supplies to treat 150 trauma patients and other supplies for a range of health conditions to treat 45,000 people.

Dr. Michael Ryan, WHO's emergencies chief, acknowledged that sending medical supplies to Ukraine was unlikely to make a big difference.

""This is putting bandages on mortal wounds right now,"" he said.

WHO chief Tedros said some of the main health challenges officials were facing in Ukraine were hypothermia and frostbite, respiratory disease, heart disease, cancer and mental health issues. He added that WHO staffers have been sent to countries neighbouring Ukraine to provide mental health support to fleeing refugees, mostly women and children.

LONDON -- The European Union is working on sending communications equipment to Ukraine after the country asked Brussels for help to keep telecom networks running.

The EU ""received a request from our Ukrainian friends and we're in the process of coordinating on that,"" French digital minister Cedric O said Wednesday.

The minister said EU officials discussed aid in the form of electronic and computer equipment that they could offer Ukraine to ensure the country's telecom and administrative networks ""continue as normally possible.""

He did not go into details but said it was all civilian equipment ""necessary to keep an administration up and running.""

As the Russian offensive grinds on, Ukraine's ability to maintain telecommunications in some areas is in question as cellphone networks went down in the besieged port city of Mariupol.

BERLIN -- German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is indicating that he doesn't favour supplying old MiG fighter jets to Ukraine.

Poland late Tuesday offered to give the U.S. 28 MiG-29 fighter planes for Ukraine's use. U.S. officials said the proposal was ""untenable,"" but they would continue to consult with Poland and other NATO allies.

Scholz was asked Wednesday whether Germany would be prepared to allow such a delivery, and whether he feared being drawn into the conflict by a jet delivery via the United States' Ramstein Air Base in Germany -- which Poland had proposed.

Scholz noted that Germany has given Ukraine financial and humanitarian aid, as well as some weapons. He added: ""otherwise, we must consider very carefully what we do in concrete terms, and that most certainly doesn't include fighter planes.""

LONDON -- Britain's defence minister says Russia's military assault on Ukraine will get ""more brutal and more indiscriminate"" as President Vladimir Putin tries to regain momentum against fierce Ukrainian resistance.

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told British lawmakers that Russia was seeking to use mercenaries from the Wagner Group in Ukraine, calling that a sign of ""desperation.""

The Wagner Group, owned by a confidant of Putin, has been accused by Western governments and UN experts of human rights abuses in Africa and involvement in the conflict in Libya.

Wallace said the group was ""responsible for all sorts of atrocities in Africa and the Middle East. And the fact that Russia is now trying to encourage them to take part in Ukraine, I think, is a telling sign.""

Western intelligence officials are concerned that Russia plans to use violence to terrorize the population and deter protests in areas of Ukraine under its control. A European official told the AP that Russia was considering ""aggressive measures"" including ""violent crowd control, repressive detention of protest organizers"" and even public executions.

BERLIN -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he has told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that Canada will soon send Ukraine ""highly specialized equipment.""

Trudeau said during a visit to Berlin that Zelensky also accepted an invitation to address the Canadian Parliament during Wednesday's conversation. Zelensky spoke to the British Parliament on Tuesday.

Trudeau said Canada will be able to start sending ""in the coming days"" equipment including cameras used in drones. He acknowledged that ""there are challenges at the borders in terms of getting equipment securely across and into Ukrainian hands, but we are working through that.""

ROME -- Luxury Italian car maker Ferrari says it has decided to suspend production of vehicles for the Russian market for now.

Ferrari CEO Benedetto Vigna said the company ""stands alongside everyone in Ukraine affected by this ongoing humanitarian crisis."" He said ""we cannot remain indifferent to the suffering,"" adding that Ferrari is ""playing our small part alongside the institutions that are bringing immediate relief to this situation.""

The company is donating 1 million euros to support Ukrainians in need.

BERLIN -- The International Atomic Energy Agency says it sees ""no critical impact on safety"" from the power cut at the decommissioned Chornobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine.

The Vienna-based UN nuclear watchdog said Wednesday that Ukraine had informed it of the loss of electricity and that the development violates a ""key safety pillar on ensuring uninterrupted power supply."" But it tweeted that ""in this case IAEA sees no critical impact on safety.""

The IAEA said that there could be ""effective heat removal without need for electrical supply"" from spent nuclear fuel at the site.

MARIUPOL, Ukraine -- City authorities in the besieged southern Ukrainian port city of Mariupol are burying their dead in a mass grave.

With the city under steady bombardment, officials had been waiting for a chance to allow individual burials to resume. But with morgues overflowing, and many corpses uncollected at home, they decided they had to take action.

A deep trench some 25 metres long has been opened in one of the city's old cemeteries in the heart of the city. Social workers brought 30 bodies wrapped in carpets or bags Wednesday, and 40 were brought Tuesday.

The dead include civilian victims of shelling on the city as well as some soldiers. Workers with the municipal social services have also been collecting bodies from homes, including some civilians who died of disease or natural causes.

No mourners were present, no families said their goodbyes.

LONDON -- Dutch brewer Heineken, TV company Discovery and the Universal Music Group have joined the corporate exodus from Russia over the Ukraine invasion.

Heineken said Wednesday it will stop the production, advertising and sale of the beer brand in Russia. The company said it stands with the Ukrainian people and called the Russian government's war ""an unprovoked and completely unjustified attack.""

""We will take immediate steps to ring-fence our Russian business from the wider Heineken business to stop the flow of monies, royalties and dividends out of Russia,"" said Heinken, which earlier stopped all new investments and exports to Russia.

Discovery said in a brief statement that it decided to ""suspend the broadcast of its channels and services in Russia."" The indefinite suspension is set to take effect by the end of Wednesday.

Universal Music Group said late Tuesday that it's suspending all its operations and closing its offices in Russia, effective immediately.

Earlier Wednesday, Imperial Brands became the first of the so-called Big Four tobacco producers to halt all operations in Russia. It said the move includes halting production at its factory in Volgograd and ceasing all sales and marketing activity in the country.

LVIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian authorities say the decommissioned Chornobyl nuclear plant, the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster, has been knocked off the power grid. Emergency generators are now supplying backup power.

The state communications agency says the outage could put systems for cooling nuclear material at risk.

The cause of the damage to the power line serving Chornobyl was not immediately clear, but it comes amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The site has been under control of Russian troops since last week.

Ukrainian grid operator Ukrenerho said that according to the national nuclear regulator, all Chornobyl facilities are without power and the diesel generators have fuel for 48 hours. Without power the ""parameters of nuclear and radiation safety"" cannot be controlled, it said.

Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the grid supplying electricity is damaged and called for a ceasefire to allow for repairs.

BRATISLAVA, Slovakia -- The Slovak government has approved a plan for NATO service members to be deployed in Slovakia. The move is part of NATO plans to strengthen the alliance's eastern flank following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The Slovak Defence Ministry said on Wednesday that up to 2,100 troops could be deployed to help boost his country's defence capabilities. It will be the first such a long term deployment of NATO troops in the country.

Germany will contribute up 700 soldiers, including the Patriot air defence system, and up to 600 troops will come from the Czech Republic and 400 from the United States. The Netherlands, Poland and Slovenia will also send their troops.

The plan still need approval from the Parliament where the ruling coalition has a majority.

WARSAW, Poland -- Poland is ready to make its Russian-made fighter jets available to Ukraine, via NATO, Poland's prime minister said Wednesday. But he added that it's a ""very serious decision"" that should be taken by all NATO alliance members because it affects wider security.

Premier Mateusz Morawiecki says the decision on whether to make the MiG-29 planes available to Ukraine as it fights Russia's invasion is now in the hands of NATO and the U.S.

""Poland is not a side in this war (...) and NATO is not a side in this war,"" Morawiecki said during a visit to Vienna. ""Such a serious decision like handing over planes must be unanimous and unequivocally taken by by all of the North Atlantic Alliance.""

Morawiecki said talks on the subject are continuing.

Ukraine has been calling on the U.S. and Western countries to provide fighter jets. Poland responded on Tuesday by offering to transfer its planes to a U.S. military base in Germany, with the expectation that the planes would then be handed over to Ukrainian pilots. The Pentagon reacted by saying it had not been aware of the plan which it finds ""untenable.""

BRUSSELS -- European Union countries have agreed to slap further sanctions on Russia, targeting oligarchs and their relatives who played a role in the invasion of Ukraine.

In addition to measures already adopted targeting President Vladimir Putin, Russia's financial system and the country's high-tech industry, the EU imposed new sanctions on 160 individuals and added new restrictions on the export of maritime navigation and radio communication technology. The extra measures are also aimed at Russia's ally Belarus.

The French presidency of the European Council said they will exclude three Belarussian banks from SWIFT, the dominant system for global financial transactions.

KYIV, Ukraine -- Civilians from besieged towns northwest of Kyiv worked their way toward the capital Wednesday, crossing over a small river via a damaged bridge.

The bridge area has come under sporadic mortar fire in recent days, with civilians killed. But there was little shelling reported in the area Wednesday morning, so civilians took their chance to leave their homes in the hope of finding safety.

Firefighters pulled an elderly man in a handcart, and police helped others across. A soldier held a child's hand. A woman carried her cat.

One resident of the town of Irpin described four days without heat, electricity, water or cell phone connections. Others came from neighboring Bucha.

The route from Irpin and Bucha to Kyiv is part of a humanitarian corridor announced by Ukrainian authorities Wednesday.

Thousands have been entering Kyiv via this route in recent days, with many then taken to the railway station for onward evacuation by train to Ukraine's west.

""We have a short window of time at the moment (for evacuations). Even if there is a ceasefire right now, there is a high risk of shells falling at any moment,"" said Yevhen Nyshchuk, actor and former culture minister, now a member of Ukraine's territorial defence forces.

KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says efforts are under way to evacuate some 18,000 people from the capital Kyiv and embattled towns near it.

He said Wednesday the efforts are part of broader evacuation attempts by multiple humanitarian corridors within Ukraine, and warned Russian forces against violating ceasefire promises.

He appealed again for foreign air support, saying ""send us planes."" Western powers have sent military equipment and beefed up forces on Ukraine's eastern flank, but have been wary of providing air support and getting drawn into a direct war with Russia.

He also issued an appeal, unusually in Russian, to urge Russian soldiers to leave.

""Our resistance for almost two weeks has shown you that we will not surrender, because this is our home. It is our families and children. We will fight until we can win back our land,"" he said. ""You can still save yourselves if you just go home.""

LONDON -- Britain has impounded a private jet it suspects of being linked to a Russian oligarch, and tightened aviation sanctions against Russia in response to the invasion of Ukraine.

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said Wednesday the Luxembourg-registered plane had been seized at Farnborough Airport in southern England while U.K. authorities tried to unravel its ownership.

U.K. officials believe the Bombardier Global 6500 jet is connected to billionaire oil tycoon Eugene Shvidler. It arrived in the U.K. from New Jersey last week and had been due to fly to Dubai on Tuesday.

Britain has banned Russian-owned or operated planes from its airspace, but Shapps said the government was still working to close some ""loopholes.""

The government announced late Tuesday it was toughening sanctions to include ""the power to detain any aircraft owned by persons connected with Russia."" Britain also banned the export of aviation- or space-related items and technology to Russia.

MARIUPOL, Ukraine -- The besieged Azov Sea port city of Mariupol has seen some of the most desperate scenes of the war, with civilians struggling without water, heat, basic sanitation or phones for several days.

With water supplies cut, people have been collecting water from streams or melting snow.

The representatives of Ukraine's Red Cross are trying to deliver first aid to those who need it the most, but resources are scarce.

""There is no heating, electricity, water, natural gas ... In other words there is nothing. no household commodities. The water is collected from the roofs after the rain,"" says Aleksey Berntsev, head of Red Cross of Mariupol.

People sheltered in underground basements, anxiously waiting for news of evacuation efforts as they struggled to survive in a city where bodies have been left uncollected on the streets.

Berentsev said that apart from delivering aid, giving local residents information is one of the most important task they are undertaking.

""Sometimes information is more important for the people than food,"" he says.

Power cuts mean that many residents have lost internet access and now rely on their car radios for information, picking up news from stations broadcast from areas controlled by Russian or Russian-backed separatist forces.

WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- New Zealand lawmakers have unanimously passed a bill to impose economic sanctions on Russia.

Unlike many countries that had already imposed sanctions, New Zealand's laws didn't previously allow it to apply meaningful measures unless they were part of a broader United Nations effort. Because Russia has UN Security Council veto power, that had left New Zealand hamstrung.

The new law, which was rushed through in a single day, targets those in Russia associated with the invasion, including oligarchs. It will allow New Zealand to freeze assets and stop superyachts or planes from arriving. Lawmakers said it would stop New Zealand becoming a safe haven for Russian oligarchs looking to avoid sanctions elsewhere.

LONDON -- British defence officials say Russia's assault on Kyiv has failed to make progress but several Ukrainian cities continue to suffer heavy shelling.

In an update posted on social media Wednesday, the Ministry of Defence said ""fighting north-west of Kyiv remains ongoing with Russian forces failing to make any significant breakthroughs.""

It said the cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol remain encircled by Russian forces and are being heavily shelled.

The ministry said Ukraine's air defences were holding up against Russian aircraft, ""probably preventing them achieving any degree of control of the air.

BEIJING -- China says it is sending humanitarian aid including food and daily necessities worth 5 million yuan (US$791,000) to Ukraine while continuing to oppose sanctions against Russia over its invasion.

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told reporters an initial batch was sent to the Ukrainian Red Cross on Wednesday with more to follow ""as soon as possible.""

China has largely backed Russia in the conflict and Zhao reiterated Beijing's opposition to biting economic sanctions against Moscow.

Zhao told reporters at a daily briefing that ""wielding the stick of sanctions at every turn will never bring peace and security but cause serious difficulties to the economies and livelihoods of the countries concerned.""

He said China and Russia will ""continue to carry out normal trade cooperation, including oil and gas trade, in the spirit of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit.""

China has sought to blame the U.S. for instigating the conflict, citing what it calls Washington's failure to adequately consider Russia's ""legitimate"" security concerns in the face of NATO expansion.

LVIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian authorities have announced a 9 a.m.-9 p.m. ceasefire along several evacuation routes for civilians in besieged or occupied cities, though it is unclear whether Russian forces will respect it.

Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Russian authorities on Wednesday confirmed the ceasefire along the evacuation corridors to Ukrainian counterparts and the Red Cross.

She said the routes lead out of Sumy in the northeast, Mariupol on the Azov Sea coast, Enerhodar in the south, Volnovakha in the southeast, Izyum in the east, and several towns in the Kyiv region.

All the corridors lead to sites elsewhere in Ukraine that are currently held by the Ukrainian government.

The route out of Sumy, on the Russian border, is the only one that has been used successfully so far, allowing for the evacuation of 5,000 people on Tuesday southwest to the city of Poltava.

Ukrainian officials released videos Wednesday showing trucks and buses with red cross symbols heading to besieged cities.

------

BERLIN -- The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross says he hopes that corridors to evacuate civilians from under-fire cities in Ukraine will begin to work better after a sputtering start.

ICRC President Peter Maurer told Germany's Deutschlandfunk radio on Wednesday that his organization has been working for days to bring the warring parties together and encourage them to hold detailed military-to-military talks on enabling civilians to flee.

Maurer said it's important that agreements succeed ""because the military units stand close to each other and the smallest uncertainty, as we have seen in recent days, leads instantly to exchanges of fire, and that makes the escape routes impossible.""

He added: ""We hope that it will work better today; in any case, we are talking to the parties and, above all, the parties are talking to each other -- that is the most important thing at the moment.""

But, pressed on how confident he is, he added: ""I really can't speculate. But we hope that today a large number can at least get to safety at least from some cities.""

Russia's Defence Ministry says it has thwarted a large-scale plot to attack separatist-held regions of eastern Ukraine.

Defence Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov on Wednesday cited from what he claimed was an intercepted Ukrainian National Guard document laying out plans for a weekslong operation targeting the Donbas region.

Konashenkov said in a televised statement: ""The special military operation of the Russian armed forces, carried out since Feb. 24, preempted and thwarted a large-scale offensive by strike groups of Ukrainian troops on the Luhansk and Donetsk People's Republics, which are not controlled by Kyiv, in March of this year.""

He did not address Russia's shelling, airstrikes and attacks on Ukrainian civilians or cities, Russian military casualties or any other aspect of its bogged-down campaign.

Russia calls its invasion of Ukraine a ""special military operation,"" and official statements about the war have focused almost exclusively on fighting and evacuations in the separatist-held regions, where Russian-backed forces have been fighting Ukraine's military since 2014.

LVIV, Ukraine -- The general staff of Ukraine's armed forces says the country is building up its defence of key cities in the north, south and east as Russia's advance has stalled.

In a statement early Wednesday, it said that forces around Kyiv are resisting the Russian offensive with unspecified strikes and ""holding the line.""

The Ukrainian general staff said that in the northern city of Chernihiv, Russian forces are placing military equipment among residential buildings and on farms.

And in the south, it said Russians dressed in civilian clothes are advancing on the city of Mykolaiv.

Meanwhile, the administration of the northeastern border city of Sumy says further civilian evacuations are planned Wednesday.

In a Telegram post, regional administration chief Dmytro Zhyvytsky says a safe corridor will be open from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. and 22 buses that traveled the day before from Sumy southwest to the city of Poltava would return Wednesday afternoon to pick up more people seeking to flee. Priority will go to pregnant women, women with children, the elderly and the disabled.

Sumy is on the Russian border and has seen deadly shelling in recent days. The Sumy-Poltava route is the only one successfully used so far for humanitarian evacuations, and some 5,000 people, including 1,700 foreign students, were brought out Tuesday. Other evacuation efforts stalled or were thwarted by Russian shelling.

LVIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine's energy minister said Russian forces that now control a Ukrainian nuclear plant are forcing the exhausted staff to record an address that they plan to use for propaganda purposes.

Russian troops have been in control of the Zaporizhzhia plant, the largest in Europe, since seizing it an attack on Friday that set a building on fire and raised fears of a nuclear disaster. It was later determined that no radiation was released.

Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said on Facebook that about 500 Russian soldiers and 50 pieces of heavy equipment are inside the station. He said the Ukrainian staff are ""physically and emotionally exhausted.""

Russia describes the war as a ""special military operation"" and says it is conducting targeted attacks. Halushchenko's reference to propaganda appears to refer to Russian efforts to show it is not endangering Ukrainian civilians or infrastructure.

WASHINGTON -- Additional air defence capabilities are the number one priority for Ukraine's military right now, the country's U.S. defence attache, Maj. Gen. Borys Kremenetskyi, said Tuesday after returning from a meeting at the Pentagon.

""It can be ground based air defence systems. It can be fighter jets, whatever possible,"" he said in an interview with The Associated Press.

He said there are countries around the world that have Soviet-produced air defence systems that the Ukrainians already know how to operate. ""The U.S. government can also motivate those countries to provide us this equipment,"" he said.

They also need additional anti-tank, anti-armor weapons and coastal defence capabilities to defend against Russian ships at the south.

UNITED NATIONS -- Natalia Mudrenko, the highest-ranking woman at Ukraine's UN Mission, is accusing Russia of effectively holding civilians ""hostage,"" and says ""the critical situation"" in Mariupol and other cities demands immediate action by world leaders and humanitarian and medical organizations.

She told a UN Security Council meeting Tuesday on women in conflict that civilians, mostly women and children, ""are not allowed to leave and the humanitarian aid is not let in.""

""If they try to leave, Russians open fire and kill them,"" Mudrenko said, her voice shaking with emotion. ""They are running out of food and water, and they die.""

The Russian military has denied firing on convoys and charged that the Ukrainian side was blocking the evacuation effort.

Mudrenko said a 6-year-old girl died Monday in the besieged city of Mariupol on the Azov Sea, ""alone in the last moments of her life as her mother was killed by Russian shelling.""

On Tuesday in the Mykolaiv region, she said ""Russian occupiers fired at a van with a group of female teachers of the local orphanage (and) three of them were killed."" She said there are also ""cases of child sexual violence committed by occupiers.""

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. House overwhelmingly approved legislation that would ban Russian oil imports to the United States, an effort to put into law the restrictions announced by President Joe Biden in response to the escalating war in Ukraine.

Going further than Biden’s import ban on Russian oil, the bill making its way through Congress would also encourage a review of Russia’s status in the World Trade Organization and signal U.S. support for sanctions on Russian officials over human rights violations, as the U.S. works to economically isolate the regime.

Lawmakers in both parties have been eager to act, willing to risk higher gas prices at home in order to support Ukraine with a show of U.S. bipartisanship. The legislation was approved Wednesday, 414-17, and now goes to the Senate.

Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, who helped draft the bill, acknowledged it may cost more to fill up tanks at home to stop Russian President Vladimir Putin’s tanks abroad.

“It is one way to demonstrate our solidarity,” Doggett said during the debate.

TOKYO — Japanese electronics and entertainment giant Sony is suspending all shipments of its PlayStation video game consoles as well as game software to Russia because of the war in Ukraine.

Launch of “Gran Turismo 7,” a popular racing car game, is being suspended, and the PlayStation store in Russia will close, Sony Interactive Entertainment said in a statement Thursday.

The company “joins the global community in calling for peace in Ukraine,” it said.

Sony, which has movies and music businesses, earlier said it’s halted theatrical releases of its movies in Russia. Sony Group Corp. has also announced $2 million in humanitarian aid to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and the international aid group Save the Children to help war victims.

TOKYO — Japanese machinery and technology company Hitachi Group is suspending exports to Russia and has temporarily stopped manufacturing there.

Story continues

Hitachi said Thursday products and services related to electric power equipment “indispensable to the daily lives of people” will continue. Operations in Ukraine have resumed by moving employees and families to safer areas, it said.

“Hitachi Group considers the safety and health of all employees and their families as its top priority. In Ukraine, the company is engaged in various activities to realize this goal and hopes that peace will return as soon as possible,” it said.

IRPIN, Ukraine — Hundreds of Ukrainians living in towns occupied by Russian troops on the outskirts of Kyiv fled Wednesday.

Streams of cars -- some fixed with white flags -- filed down the road, joined by lines of yellow buses marked with red crosses.

The Interior Ministry said about 700 people were evacuated from Vorzel and Irpin. People from three other Kyiv suburbs were unable to leave. Some who managed to get out said they hadn’t eaten in days.

“I forgot when I ate last,” said an Irpin resident who gave only her first name, Olena. “I’m so scared. I need to keep walking.”

Iuliia Bushinska, a Vorzel resident, said: “Occupiers came to our house and they were ready to shoot us.""

""They took away our house, our car, they took away our documents. So we need to start our life from the beginning. We survived things that I never experienced in my life,” Bushinska said.

WASHINGTON — The U.S. government publicly warned that Russia might seek to use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, after Russia, without evidence, accused Ukraine of having chemical weapons labs.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki called Russia’s claim “preposterous” and said it could be part of an attempt by Russia to lay the groundwork for using such weapons of mass destruction against Ukraine itself.

“This is all an obvious ploy by Russia to try to try to justify its further premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified attack on Ukraine,” said Psaki.

“Now that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them.”

Russia has used chemical weapons before in carrying out assassination attempts against Putin enemies like Alexey Navalny and former spy Sergei Skripal. It also supports the Assad government in Syria which has used chemical weapons against its people in a decade-long civil war.

LVIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on the West to impose even tougher sanctions on Russia after the airstrike on the maternity hospital in Mariupol.

“A genocide of Ukrainians is taking place,” Zelenskyy said Wednesday in his daily late evening video address to the nation. Wearing his now traditional wartime army green, he said the West should strengthen the sanctions so Russia “no longer has any possibility to continue this genocide.”

He said 17 people were injured in the attack, including pregnant women.

Mariupol has been blockaded by Russian troops for nine days. City officials said Wednesday that about 1,200 residents have been killed.

Zelenskyy again called on Western leaders to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine, something NATO members have refused to do for fear of provoking a wider war with Russia. Short of that, Zelenskyy called for the delivery of more fighter jets to Ukraine, a proposal the Pentagon rejected on Wednesday.

Zelenskyy said about 35,000 civilians have used humanitarian corridors to flee to western Ukraine to escape the fighting.

NEW YORK — Wall Street titan Citigroup said it would wind down its Russian banking business, with the ultimate goal of finding a seller. But the bank also acknowledged that selling the business may be difficult due to the Russian economy “being disconnected from the global financial system.”

Citigroup had a robust presence in Russia for several years, operating branches in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other major Russian cities. The company also did investment banking and business banking in the region.

Until the business is sold, Citi said it is “operating the business on a more limited basis” and is helping its U.S. and other corporate clients unwind or suspend their businesses in Russia.

Weeks before Russia invaded, Citi had announced it was leaving several Asian markets including Russia as part of a company-wide strategic review of its major markets. Citi is probably the most global of the Wall Street banks, operating consumer banking franchises in Asia, Latin America and Europe.

WASHINGTON — The Pentagon slammed the door Wednesday on any plans to provide MiG fighter jets to Ukraine, even through a second country, calling it a “high-risk” venture that would not significantly change the Ukrainian Air Force's effectiveness.

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Polish counterpart on Wednesday and told him the U.S. assessment. He said the U.S. is pursuing other options that would provide more critical military needs to Ukraine such as air defense and anti-armor weapons systems.

Poland had said it was prepared to hand over MiG-29 planes to NATO that could then be delivered to Ukraine, but Kirby said U.S. intelligence concluded that it could trigger a “significant” Russian reaction.

LVIV, Ukraine — Russian aircraft bombed Zhytomyr on Wednesday evening, while artillery fire continued pounding the suburbs of Kyiv and Kharkiv, the country’s second largest city.

In Zhytomyr, a city of 260,000 to the west of Kyiv, bombs fell on two hospitals, one of them a children’s hospital, Mayor Serhii Sukhomlyn said on Facebook. He said the number of casualties was still being determined.

“Oh, this is a hot night,” he said in a video address to city residents. “Russia understands that it is losing strategically, but we have to hold out.”

Russian artillery shelled Kharkiv, destroying a police headquarters, killing at least four people and wounding 15, prosecutors office representative Serhii Bolvinov said on Facebook. He said since the invasion began nearly two weeks ago, 282 city residents have been killed, including six children.

After darkness fell, Russian artillery again began shelling Kyiv suburbs.

“Russian troops are methodically turning our life into a hell. People day and night have to sit underground without food, water or electricity,” the head of the Kyiv region, Oleksiy Kuleba, said on Ukrainian television.

UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations has received official notification from Ukraine that it intends to withdraw about 250 troops serving in the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Congo as well as military equipment, including some aircraft.

U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric confirmed the withdrawal on Wednesday stressing that every country has a right to withdraw military forces contributed to peacekeeping operations. He acknowledged “the tremendous role Ukraine has played, especially on issues of transport and helicopters.”

Dujarric said it is up to the Ukrainian government to explain why it asked to pull out the troops and the U.N. will be contacting other countries to replace the troops and equipment in the Congo mission known as MONUSCO which has about 17,800 personnel.

The U.N. spokesman said Ukrainians remain present in smaller numbers in other U.N. peacekeeping missions — 13 in South Sudan, 12 in Mali, five in Cyprus, four in Abyei and three in the U.N. political mission in Kosovo.

WASHINGTON — U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that President Volodymr Zelenskyy has told her that it will take “everybody’s help” in rebuilding Ukraine after the war with Russia.

Pelosi said she had a more than 45 minute call Wednesday with Zelenskyy. She said the Ukrainian president again asked for U.S. help in sending warplanes, anti-aircraft missiles and tanks to fight the Russian invasion.

But Pelosi said Zelenskyy also told her: “We’re going to need everybody’s help in rebuilding Ukraine as soon as we end this war.”

Pelosi said she hopes the U.S. can help facilitate the transfer of Soviet-era MiG fighter planes that Ukraine has requested from neighboring NATO allies. But she noted there’s a school of thought that suggests anti-aircraft missiles could also help Ukraine in its fight against Russia.

The Pentagon has rejected the idea of sending any fighter jets to Ukraine.

UNITED NATIONS — Russia’s “illegal, unprovoked” and “cruel” war against Ukraine is underscoring the many different ways in which peace, security and a stable climate are linked, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said Wednesday.

Kerry told an informal U.N. Security Council meeting on Climate Finance for Sustaining Peace that “the crisis in Ukraine really does underscore the risks that we face in the current volatile and uncertain energy markets.”

The U.S. special presidential envoy for climate said in a virtual speech that “Russia has attacked a nuclear facility in Ukraine, dangerous in and of itself, risky.”

There was increasing concern Wednesday over the safety of the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant, which Russian troops seized early in the invasion and which lost power and had to revert to backup generators. And there is also concern about the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the largest in Europe, which Russia seized last week.

The United States is responding by banning the import of Russian oil, liquefied natural gas and coal, “and many other nations are now rethinking their reliance on Russian energy sources,” Kerry said. The “instability, conflict, death destruction” in Ukraine is happening in the context of “a global existential crisis” of global warming that scientists have warned about for decades, he said.

“We are actually living through the consequences of that crisis,” Kerry said.

WASHINGTON — The United Arab Emirates said Wednesday it will urge OPEC to consider boosting oil output.

The announcement followed a U.S. ban on imports of Russian oil, the latest in a series of sanctions designed to punish Russia for the war in Ukraine. Oil prices have risen sharply since Russia — the world’s third-largest oil producer — invaded Ukraine late last month.

“We favor production increases and will be encouraging OPEC to consider higher production levels,” UAE’s ambassador to the United States, Yousef Al Otaiba, said in a statement posted on his embassy’s website. He said his country believes that stability in energy markets is critical to the global economy.

The UAE is a longtime member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which last week, along with its oil-producing allies including Russia, said it was sticking to its plan to gradually increase oil production rather that opening the spigots further.

The UAE was the world’s seventh-largest oil producing nation in 2020, according to U.S. Department of Energy figures published in December of last year.

Oil prices surged Tuesday after President Joe Biden announced the U.S. ban on Russian oil. But the possibility of increased OPEC output helped send prices tumbling Wednesday. A barrel of U.S. crude oil dropped 11% to $110.12.

BERLIN — The head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog said he will travel to Antalya in Turkey on Thursday at the invitation of Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu as concerns rise over the security of Ukraine’s nuclear reactors.

Cavusoglu will host a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers in Antalya as the two-week-long war in Ukraine claims more victims. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi tweeted Wednesday evening that he will attend meetings and hopes “to make progress on the urgent issue of ensuring the safety and security of #Ukraine’s nuclear facilities. We need to act now!”

Concerns rose Wednesday over the safety of the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant, which Russian troops seized early in the invasion and which lost power and had to revert to backup generators. The state communications agency said the power outage could put systems for cooling nuclear material at risk. The site has been under control of Russian troops since last week.

Ukraine’s nuclear regulator said remote data transmission from monitoring systems at Chernobyl has been lost.

The Vienna-based U.N. nuclear watchdog said it saw no critical impact on safety at Chernobyl because there could be “effective heat removal without need for electrical supply” from spent nuclear fuel at the site.

SEATTLE — Amazon said it will suspend shipments of products sold on its website to customers based in Russia and Belarus.

The e-commerce giant said late Tuesday in a blog update on its website that it will also suspend Prime Video access for customers based in Russia and will stop taking orders for New World, the only video game the company says it sells directly in the Russia. The retailer added new Russia and Belarus-based third-party sellers won’t be able to sell on its site.

The retailer had said earlier in the day that its cloud computing network, Amazon Web Services, will also stop allowing new sign-ups in Russia and Belarus. Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov had called on the company to stop providing AWS in Russia, suggesting in a letter sent to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos that not doing so could be supporting “bloodshed and disinformation that can be leveraged through digital infrastructures.”

WASHINGTON — U.S. gasoline prices hit another record on Wednesday, with the national average rising to $4.25 a gallon, an overnight increase of eight cents, according to the AAA auto club.

Motorists in California continue to pay the highest prices, with the statewide average at $5.57 a gallon. Prices topped $4.50 in Illinois, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Alaska and Hawaii.

Gasoline prices have been rising for nearly two years, following the trend in oil prices. Production fell at the outset of the pandemic, and producers have not pumped enough oil since then to meet rising demand.

The national average for gas has spiked 60 cents in just the past week, which analysts say is almost entirely due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which led President Joe Biden to announce Tuesday that the U.S. will ban the import of Russian oil.

TIRANA, Albania — The U.S. Special Operations Command Europe, or SOCEUR, opened its forward-based headquarters in Albania on Wednesday, aiming at enhancing regional stability, its head Maj. Gen. David Tabor said.

A 12- to 15-member Task Force Balkans group will be based in Tirana to coordinate joint and combined exchange training and civil military support element engagements, Tabor said. Tabor said Albania’s central location in the Balkans was behind the decision to open the command there, he said.

It will be the first-ever U.S. permanent military presence in Albania, said U.S. Ambassador in Tirana Yuri Kim.

Albanian senior officials said that opening such a U.S. military office is more important now.

The opening of the command in Tirana ""came at the proper moment, at the culmination of the insecurity due to the gloomy situation in the continent after Russian aggression,” said Defense Minister Niko Peleshi.

PRAGUE — The Czech government has agreed to give refugees from Ukraine free access to the labor market without any work permit.

Labor and Social Affairs Minister Marian Jurecka said Wednesday that the refugees will be in a position “of any other citizen” if they want to get a job.

The refugees will only need to get a visa for their stay in the Czech Republic to work. Assistance centers in all regions of the Czech Republic are working around the clock to provide all necessary documents and other initial help, including housing, to the refugees.

It’s estimated some 150,000 people have arrived in the country that doesn’t border Ukraine invaded by the Russian troops.

Jurecka said there are some 350,000 jobs currently available in the Czech Republic.

The government also approved a plan to give all the refugees a financial contribution of $215 on arrival. They would be able to receive it monthly six times if needed.

The foreign ministry said in a statement Wednesday that the shipment will reach a European Union logistics hub set up in conjunction with Polish authorities.

The aid — collected mainly from individual donations — includes 88 tons of foodstuffs, sleeping bags, tents blankets and portable toilets, 5,000 pairs of shoes, bottled water, an electricity generator, personal hygiene kits and 14 tons of medical supplies.

The aid is a “tangible demonstration of the solidarity of Cyprus to the Ukrainian people,” the ministry said. Freight costs were covered by the ministry.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed Ukrainian “nationalists” for hampering the evacuation of civilians from besieged Ukrainian cities.

The Kremlin said that Putin discussed the situation in Ukraine in Wednesday’s phone call with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, with a “special emphasis given to the humanitarian aspects.” It said that Putin told Scholz about Russian “efforts to organize humanitarian corridors for civilians to exit areas of fighting and attempts by militants from nationalist units to hamper safe evacuation of people.”

Ukrainian officials said that the continuous Russian shelling has derailed efforts to evacuate civilians from areas affected by fighting.

LONDON — British American Tobacco said it has suspended all planned capital investment in Russia but continues to operate there, even as many other Western brands announce they’re halting all business in the country because of the Ukraine invasion.

The company, one of the so-called Big Four tobacco producers, said Wednesday that it has a “duty of care” to all its 2,500 employees in Russia. BAT said it’s focusing on its locally produced tobacco products in Russia, where it has substantial manufacturing and has been operating since 1991.

“Furthermore, we are scaling our business activities appropriate to the current situation, including rationalising our marketing activities,” the company said, adding it’s complying with all international sanctions related to the conflict.

The company said it is “deeply concerned about the conflict in Ukraine,” where it employs 1,000 people and has suspended all business and manufacturing.

In contrast, another major tobacco producer, Imperial Brands, said earlier Wednesday it would halt all operations in Russia, including production at its factory in Volgograd and ceasing all sales and marketing activity.

Separately, S&P Global Ratings said it has suspended commercial operations in Russia. The credit rating agency said it would maintain analytical coverage from outside Russia.

A statement on the city council’s social media account on Wednesday said the hospital suffered “colossal” damage.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy tweeted that there were “people, children under the wreckage.” He called the strike an “atrocity.”

The deputy head of Zelenskyy’s office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, said authorities are trying to establish the number of people who may have been killed or wounded.

GENEVA — The international Red Cross says civilians caught up in places affected by fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces should have “broader relocation alternatives” for evacuation – including to other parts of Ukraine – beyond the Russian government’s offer to take them into Russian territory.

The International Committee of the Red Cross, which in particular is trying to arrange evacuations of civilians from the hard-hit port city of Mariupol, made the comments Wednesday after Russia offered in recent days to allow safe-passage corridors for Ukrainian civilians across the Russian border. Ukrainian authorities have rejected that idea.

ICRC has said authorities on both sides need to agree on any evacuation plan, and evacuations should be voluntary for the civilians concerned.

Some civilians might refuse evacuation “if the only escape route available to them implies resettling in the Russian Federation or the Republic of Belarus,” said ICRC spokesman Jason Straziuso in an email, referring to Russian ally Belarus. “In the view of the ICRC, civilians affected by the hostilities should be given broader relocation alternatives, including within Ukraine itself.”

NEW YORK — Russia has admitted that conscript soldiers have been sent into Ukraine and that some have been captured by Ukrainian troops.

The admission comes after President Vladimir Putin vowed that conscripts would not be deployed and that Russian forces would rely on professional troops.

Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said that “unfortunately there have been detected several instances of the presence of conscript-service military personnel” with units in Ukraine but that “almost all” of them had been recalled to Russia.

He added that some conscripts were taken prisoner by Ukrainian forces while serving in a logistics unit and efforts are under way to free them. Konashenkov didn’t specify how many conscripts had served in Ukraine or how many were captured.
