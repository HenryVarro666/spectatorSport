An Estonian-owned cargo ship has sunk off Ukraine’s major Black Sea port of Odesa, hours after a Bangladeshi vessel was hit by a missile or bomb at another port.

Many shipping firms have suspended sailings to affected Black Sea ports and other terminals in Ukraine as Russia’s invasion of the country enters its second week.

At least three commercial ships have been hit by projectiles since February 24.

Two crew members from the Marshall Islands-flagged and Estonian-owned Helt cargo ship were in a life raft at sea while four others were unaccounted for, Igor Ilves, managing director of Tallinn-based manager Vista Shipping Agency, told the Reuters news agency on Thursday.

“The vessel has finally sunk,” he said. “Two of the crew are in a raft on the water and four others are missing. I don’t know where they are at the moment.”

Ilves said the vessel might have struck a mine.

“It’s a big problem – nobody can help them. The Ukrainians cannot go to sea because it is under Russian control.”

Ilves said the crew comprised four Ukrainian nationals, one Russian and one Belarusian.

NATO’s Shipping Center warned on Wednesday that there was “a high risk of collateral damage on civilian shipping in the northwestern part of the Black Sea”, which included mines.

Amid calls for sanctions by the European Union, the three biggest container shipping groups in the world, Danish giant Maersk, Switzerland-based MSC and France’s CMA CGM, and other smaller competitors announced on Tuesday they were suspending non-essential deliveries to Russia.

One seafarer killed

Meanwhile, late on Wednesday evening, a missile or bomb struck a Bangladeshi-owned cargo ship in the Black Sea port of Olvia, killing one of its crew members, and efforts were under way to rescue the others from the vessel, its owner said on Thursday.

“The ship came under attack and one engineer was killed,” Pijush Dutta, executive director of Bangladesh Shipping Corp, told Reuters.

“It was not clear whether it was a bomb or missile or which side launched the attack. The other 28 crewmen are unharmed,” he said, without providing further details.

The Bangladesh-flagged Banglar Samriddhi had been stuck in Olvia since the Russian invasion began on February 24, and was hit by a missile, a Bangladeshi foreign ministry official said.

Olvia is located in the Dnipro-Bug estuary on the Black Sea coast, 15km (9 miles) south of Mykolaiv and about 110km (70 miles) east of Odesa.

In the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka, the Russian embassy said in an English-language statement on its Facebook page that the circumstances of the incident were “being established”.

“We express deep condolences to the near and dear ones of the deceased. The Russian side bends every effort to ensure safe departure of the Bangladeshi ship from the port,” it said.

Video clips on social media showed crew members asking for help after the ship was hit.

In one video, the vessel’s second engineer said the ship had been hit by a rocket with one crewmate already dead.

“We have no power supply. Emergency generator power supply is running. We are on the verge of death. We have not been rescued yet. Please save us,” the seafarer said.",https://portlouishub.com/https-www-aljazeera-com-news-2022-3-3-two-cargo-ships-hit-by-explosions-around-ukraine-one-killed/

Two weeks after the Russian offensive began in Ukraine, the foreign ministers of both countries met on Thursday in the resort town, with the Turkish government acting as mediator on the margins of the Antalya Diplomacy Forum.

The tripartite meeting, the first high-level talks since the start of the conflict, came a day after Ukraine accused Russia of war crimes over airstrikes on a maternity hospital in the besieged port of Mariupol. Russia has claimed that the hospital served as a military base for the hard-line Azov Battalion and “other radicals.”

Delegations from the two countries have held three rounds of talks previously, in Belarus and Ukraine, but with no breakthrough.

The latest round of discussions in Antalya also appear to have made little progress, with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba saying that no ceasefire agreement was reached.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba also failed to reach an agreement on humanitarian corridors or a ceasefire.

Turkey Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told reporters: “There are many elements that Russia and Ukraine are debating, including neutrality. A comprehensive peace agreement is also on the table.”

Moscow's demands include Ukrainian neutrality, demilitarization and a guarantee that Kyiv will not join NATO. In response, Kyiv recently offered Ukrainian neutrality.

Ukraine’s foreign minister described the meeting as “difficult” and said that Moscow reverted to “traditional narratives.”

Lavrov said that Russian President Vladimir Putin is willing to meet with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky to talk about “particular issues,” adding: “I hope such a need will arise.”

Both countries underlined their willingness to continue using diplomatic channels in the future.

“There was a clear gap of expectation between Kuleba and Lavrov regarding the summit in Antalya,” Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, Ankara office director of the German Marshall Fund of the US, told Arab News.

“During the press meetings, which the two foreign ministers held separately, Kuleba said that they couldn’t reach an agreement on humanitarian corridors or a ceasefire,” he said.

“When a journalist asked Lavrov about the issue, Lavrov said they never aimed to reach an agreement on humanitarian corridors or ceasefire as those issues are being discussed in Belarus,” he added.

However, experts say that bringing together the two foreign ministers was an important step towards de-escalating tensions and reminding people of the power of diplomacy.

Turkey, which shares a maritime border with Russia and Ukraine in the Black Sea, has tried to maintain a relatively neutral position during the conflict. It did not join Western sanctions against Russia, and offered to mediate peace talks while also condemning the invasion.

Turkey sees energy, trade, tourism and defense ties with Russia as important, but also values defense cooperation with Ukraine.

While Western sanctions have failed to halt the Russian offensive, Lavrov said that Moscow will no longer depend on Western companies, and will not try to persuade the West to buy oil and gas.

The UK recently issued new sanctions against seven Russian billionaires, and the International Monetary Fund approved $1.4 billion in emergency financing for Ukraine. The World Bank recently warned that sanctions have pushed Russia close to defaulting on loans.

Unluhisarcikli said that it was “unclear” what Lavrov expected from the meeting, beyond a platform to make his case to a global audience.

He added: “Turkey’s role in this process was not that of a mediator, but that of a facilitator, limited to creating a platform for bringing the parties together, which Turkey did fulfill.”

According to a survey by Aksoy Research company, 78.2 percent of people think that Turkey should remain neutral in the war.

Ankara is facing a busy diplomacy schedule over the coming days.

Following a phone call between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his US counterpart Joe Biden on Thursday, Greek PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will visit Turkey on March 13 and 14, respectively. The NATO secretary-general will also visit Erdogan on Friday.

“The message that the two parties sent out sticks to their usual playbook,” Francesco Siccardi, senior program manager at Carnegie Europe, told Arab News.

“Lavrov condemned the West for essentially provoking Russia into the war and said the Russian military was advancing as planned. Kuleba repeated that Ukraine would resist and not surrender. It was legitimate to expect some limited progress on humanitarian corridors, but the meeting in Antalya bore no concrete results. It’s clear that decisions are taken in the Kremlin.”

During the press meeting, Lavrov was asked whether Russia was planning to “attack other countries.” He replied: “We are not planning to attack other countries. We didn’t attack Ukraine in the first place.”

According to Siccardi, the parties will convene again and it is significant that the Russians have indicated this might happen in the future to discuss “specific issues.”

Turkey’s effort to facilitate talks “is valuable, even if the prospects for quick results are slim,” he said.

Samuel Ramani, associate fellow at the Royal United Service Institute, told Arab News: “Turkey’s international status within NATO was the only winner from the Russia-Ukraine talks.”

Ramani said that Turkey and Russia will benefit from their experiences in working together diplomatically. Both countries tried to deliver a ceasefire agreement in Libya in January 2020, and are co-guarantors of the Astana peace process in Syria.

Seckin Kostem, a Russia expert from Bilkent University in Ankara, said that Russia and Ukraine will most likely continue with the negotiations over the coming weeks.

“Temporary ceasefires can be accomplished, but it is unrealistic to expect a breakthrough in negotiations for a political settlement,” he told Arab News.

“Lavrov has reiterated the Kremlin’s demands from Ukraine, and in return, Kuleba demonstrated the Ukrainian government’s determination to continue resisting Russian occupation.”

Separately, on Thursday, Russia announced it would no longer attend the Council of Europe, days after the Strasbourg-based human rights body suspended Moscow’s rights of representation due to the Ukraine conflict, which has led to more than 2 million people fleeing the country.

On Saturday, Russia also released a list of “unfriendly” countries, including many members of the Council of Europe.",https://www.arabnews.com/node/2039826/world

KVIV: Russia gave holdout Ukrainian soldiers an ultimatum on Sunday to lay down arms in the pulverized southeastern port of Mariupol which Moscow said its forces nearly completely controlled in what would be its biggest capture of the nearly two-month war.

Several hours after the 0300 GMT deadline there was no sign of compliance by Ukrainian fighters holed up in the vast Azovstal steelworks overlooking the Sea of Azov.

Having failed to overcome Ukrainian resistance in the north since President Vladimir Putin’s Feb. 24 invasion, the Russian military has refocused on the eastern Donbas region where Mariupol is the main port.

The Russian Defense Ministry said its troops had cleared the urban area of Mariupol, which has seen some of the fiercest fighting and worst civilian suffering with bodies littering streets and thousands hunkered down in atrocious conditions underground.

The steelworks, one of Europe’s biggest metallurgical plants with a maze of rail tracks and blast furnaces, has become a last stand for the outnumbered defenders.

“The Russian Armed Forces offer the militants of nationalist battalions and foreign mercenaries from 06:00 (Moscow time) on April 17, 2022, to stop any hostilities and lay down their arms,” the defense ministry said in a statement.

“All who lay down their arms are guaranteed that their lives will be spared,” it said, offering the defending “remnants” a four-hour window to leave the plant without arms or ammunition.

There was no immediate response from Kyiv to the ultimatum, though Ukraine’s military said Russian air strikes on Mariupol continued along with assault operations near the port.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia on Saturday of “deliberately trying to destroy everyone” in Mariupol and said his government was in touch with the defenders. But he did not address Moscow’s claim that Ukrainian forces were no longer in urban districts.

He said killing his troops would put paid to peace efforts.

“Our soldiers are blocked, the wounded are blocked. There is a humanitarian crisis... Nevertheless, the guys are defending themselves,” he told the Ukrainska Pravda news portal.

If Russia’s capture of the port is confirmed, it would be the first major Ukrainian city to fall since the invasion and a strategic prize for Moscow: connecting territory that it holds in Donbas with the Crimea region it annexed in 2014.

Russia calls its action a special military operation aimed at demilitarizing Ukraine and clearing out what it calls dangerous nationalists.

Russia said Ukraine had lost more than 4,000 soldiers in Mariupol as of Saturday. Kyiv says between 2,500 and 3,000 Ukrainian troops have died so far in the war nationwide

It was not known how many soldiers were in the steelworks. Satellite images have shown smoke and fire coming from the area, which is riddled with tunnels underneath.

Mariupol’s defenders have included Ukrainian marines, motorized brigades, a National Guard brigade and the Azov Regiment, a militia created by far-right nationalists that was later incorporated into the National Guard.

Elsewhere around Ukraine, there were reports of more Russian long-range strikes on Sunday.

Local media reported an explosion in the capital Kyiv, though deputy mayor Mykola Povoroznyk said air defense systems had thwarted Russian attacks. The mayor of Brovary city, close to Kyiv, said a missile attack had damaged infrastructure.

And Russia said it had destroyed an ammunition factory near the capital, according to the RIA news agency.

Ukraine resisted Russian ground advances in the early phase of the war, in part by successfully deploying mobile units armed with Western-supplied anti-tank missiles against armored convoys confined to roads by muddy terrain.

Despite the desperate situation in Mariupol, Ukraine says it has so far held off Russian forces elsewhere in the Donbas regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.

Western sanctions have squeezed Russia’s economy but failed to pressure Putin into a withdrawal.

Forthcoming further European Union sanctions will target banks, including major institution Sberbank, as well as oil, the head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen told the German newspaper Bild am Sonntag.",https://www.arabnews.com/node/2040041/world
