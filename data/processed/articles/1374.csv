The name of the site, 200rf.com, is a grim reference to Cargo 200, a military code word that was used by the Soviet Union to refer to the bodies of soldiers put in zinc-lined coffins for transport away from the battlefield; it is a euphemism for troops killed in war.

The website is part of a campaign launched by Ukraine and the West to counter what American officials characterize as Russian disinformation, which includes Russia’s insistence before the invasion that the troops surrounding Ukraine were simply there for military exercises. Information and the battle for public opinion around the world have come to play an outsize part in a war that has come to seem like a David vs. Goliath contest.

On Monday, Ukraine’s ambassador to the United Nations, Sergiy Kyslytsya, read out before the General Assembly what he said were the final text messages from a Russian soldier to his mother. They were obtained, he said, by Ukrainian forces after the soldier was killed. “We were told that they would welcome us and they are falling under our armored vehicles, throwing themselves under the wheels and not allowing us to pass,” he wrote, according to Mr. Kyslytsya. “They call us fascists. Mama, this is so hard.”

The decision to read those texts, Russia experts and Pentagon officials said, was a not-so-veiled reminder to Mr. Putin of the role Russian mothers have had in bringing attention to military losses that the government tried to keep secret. In fact, a group now called the Union of Committees of Soldiers’ Mothers of Russia played a pivotal part in opening up the military to public scrutiny and in influencing perceptions of military service, Julie Elkner, a Russia historian, wrote in The Journal of Power Institutions in Post-Soviet Societies.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/01/us/politics/russia-ukraine-war-deaths.html

The Russian army on Sunday admitted that there were ""killed and injured"" soldiers among its troops in Ukraine on the fourth day of its invasion of the country, without specifying how many Russians had died there.

""Russian servicemen are showing courage and heroism while fulfilling combat tasks in the special military operation. Unfortunately, there are killed and injured among our comrades,"" Moscow's army spokesman Igor Konashenkov said on state television.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday Ukraine was willing to hold talks with Russia, but rejected convening them in neighbouring Belarus as it was being used as a launchpad for Moscow's invasion.

The Russian government has said that it is ready for talks with Ukraine in Belarus, news agency AFP reported on Sunday.

Russian troops have blown up a natural gas pipeline in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s state service of special communications and information protection has said.

Ukrainian forces put up fierce resistance to slow the advance of the larger and more powerful Russian military closing in on the capital, as the US and EU rushed ammunition and weapons to Kyiv and announced powerful new financial sanctions aimed at further isolating Moscow.

Terrified men, women and children sought safety inside and underground, and the government maintained a 39-hour curfew to keep people off the streets. More than 150,000 Ukrainians fled for Poland, Moldova and other neighboring countries, and the United Nations warned the number could grow to 4 million if fighting escalates.

Huge explosions lit up the predawn sky south of Kyiv early Sunday. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s office said one of the blasts was near the Zhuliany airport, and the mayor of Vasylkiv, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of the capital, said an oil depot was hit.

Zelenskyy's office also said Russian forces blew up a gas pipeline in Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city. The government warned that smoke from the huge explosion could cause an “environmental catastrophe” and advised people to cover their windows with damp cloth or gauze.

""We will fight for as long as needed to liberate our country,” Zelenskyy vowed.

President Vladimir Putin hasn’t disclosed his ultimate plans, but Western officials believe he is determined to overthrow Ukraine’s government and replace it with a regime of his own, redrawing the map of Europe and reviving Moscow’s Cold War-era influence.

To aid Ukraine's ability to hold out, the US pledged an additional $350 million in military assistance to Ukraine, including anti-tank weapons, body armor and small arms. Germany said it would send missiles and anti-tank weapons to the besieged country and that it would close its airspace to Russian planes.

The U.S., European Union and United Kingdom agreed to block “selected” Russian banks from the SWIFT global financial messaging system, which moves money around more than 11,000 banks and other financial institutions worldwide, part of a new round of sanctions aiming to impose a severe cost on Moscow for the invasion. They also agreed to impose ”restrictive measures” on Russia's central bank.

It was unclear how much territory Russian forces had seized or to what extent their advance had been stalled. Britain’s Ministry of Defense said “the speed of the Russian advance has temporarily slowed likely as a result of acute logistical difficulties and strong Ukrainian resistance.”

A senior U.S. defense official said more than half the Russian combat power that was massed along Ukraine’s borders has entered the country and Moscow has had to commit more fuel supply and other support units inside Ukraine than originally anticipated. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal U.S. assessments.

The curfew forcing everyone in Kyiv inside was set to last through Monday morning. The relative quiet of the capital was sporadically broken by gunfire.

Fighting on the city's outskirts suggested that small Russian units were trying to clear a path for the main forces. Small groups of Russian troops were reported inside Kyiv, but Britain and the U.S. said the bulk of the forces were 19 miles (30 kilometers) from the city's center as of the afternoon.

Russia claims its assault on Ukraine from the north, east and south is aimed only at military targets, but bridges, schools and residential neighborhoods have been hit.

Ukraine’s health minister reported Saturday that 198 people, including three children, had been killed and more than 1,000 others wounded during Europe’s largest land war since World War II. It was unclear whether those figures included both military and civilian casualties.

A missile struck a high-rise apartment building in Kyiv's southwestern outskirts near one of the city's two passenger airports, leaving a jagged hole of ravaged apartments over several floors. A rescue worker said six civilians were injured.

Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, said troops in Kyiv were fighting Russian “sabotage groups.” Ukraine says some 200 Russian soldiers have been captured and thousands killed.

Markarova said Ukraine was gathering evidence of shelling of residential areas, kindergartens and hospitals to submit to The Hague as possible crimes against humanity.

Zelenskyy reiterated his openness to talks with Russia in a video message, saying he welcomed an offer from Turkey and Azerbaijan to organize diplomatic efforts, which so far have faltered.

The Kremlin confirmed a phone call between Putin and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev but gave no hint of restarting talks. A day earlier, Zelenskyy offered to negotiate a key Russian demand: abandoning ambitions of joining NATO.

Putin sent troops into Ukraine after denying for weeks that he intended to do so, all the while building up a force of almost 200,000 troops along the countries' borders. He claims the West has failed to take seriously Russia's security concerns about NATO, the Western military alliance that Ukraine aspires to join. But he has also expressed scorn about Ukraine's right to exist as an independent state.

The effort was already coming at great cost to Ukraine, and apparently to Russian forces as well.

Ukraine's Infrastructure Ministry said a Russian missile was shot down before dawn Saturday as it headed for the dam of the sprawling reservoir that serves Kyiv. The government also said a Russian convoy was destroyed. Video images showed soldiers inspecting burned-out vehicles after Ukraine's 101st brigade reported destroying a column of two light vehicles, two trucks and a tank. The claim could not be verified.

Highways into Kyiv from the east were dotted with checkpoints manned by Ukrainian troops and young men in civilian clothes carrying automatic rifles. Low-flying planes patrolled the skies, though it was unclear if they were Russian or Ukrainian.

In addition to Kyiv, the Russian assault appeared to focus on Ukraine’s economically vital coastal areas, from near the Black Sea port of Odesa in the west to beyond the Azov Sea port of Mariupol in the east.

Ukrainian soldiers in Mariupol guarded bridges and blocked people from the shoreline amid concerns the Russian navy could launch an assault from the sea.

“I don’t care anymore who wins and who doesn’t,” said Ruzanna Zubenko, whose large family was forced from their home outside Mariupol after it was badly damaged by shelling. “The only important thing is for our children to be able to grow up smiling and not crying.”

Fighting also raged in two eastern territories controlled by pro-Russia separatists. Authorities in Donetsk said hot water supplies to the city of about 900,000 were suspended because of damage to the system by Ukrainian shelling.

The U.S. government urged Zelenskyy early Saturday to evacuate Kyiv but he turned down the offer, according to a senior American intelligence official with direct knowledge of the conversation. Zelenskyy issued a defiant video recorded on a downtown street, saying he remained in the city.

“We aren’t going to lay down weapons. We will protect the country,” he said. “Our weapon is our truth, and our truth is that it’s our land, our country, our children. And we will defend all of that.”

Hungary and Poland both opened their borders to Ukrainians.

Refugees arriving in the Hungarian border town of Zahony said men between the ages of 18 and 60 were not being allowed to leave Ukraine.

“My son was not allowed to come. My heart is so sore, I’m shaking,” said Vilma Sugar, 68.

At Poland's Medyka crossing, some said they had walked for 15 miles (35 kilometers) to reach the border.

“They didn’t have food, no tea, they were standing in the middle of a field, on the road, kids were freezing,” Iryna Wiklenko said as she waited on the Polish side for her grandchildren and daughter-in-law to make it across.

Officials in Kyiv urged residents to stay away from windows to avoid debris or bullets. Many hunkered down in basements, underground garages and subway stations, where families, some with pets, camped out on hard floors.

Shelves were sparsely stocked at grocery stores and pharmacies, and people worried how long food and medicine supplies might last.

The U.S. and its allies have beefed up forces on NATO's eastern flank but so far have ruled out deploying troops to fight Russia. Instead, the U.S., the European Union and other countries have slapped wide-ranging sanctions on Russia, freezing the assets of businesses and individuals including Putin and his foreign minister.

Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia’s Security Council, warned that Moscow could react by opting out of the last remaining nuclear arms pact, freezing Western assets and cutting diplomatic ties.

“There is no particular need in maintaining diplomatic relations,” Medvedev said. “We may look at each other in binoculars and gunsights.”",https://www.firstpost.com/world/ukraine-russia-war-news-live-updates-will-be-catastrophe-for-world-if-russia-uses-nukes-on-ukraine-says-foreign-minister-10411881.html

The Ukrainian Interior Ministry issued the appeal on February 27, directing relatives of Russian soldiers to online platforms where they can search through photos and videos of Russian soldiers captured or killed by Ukrainian forces.

The initiative, called Ishchi Svoikh (Look For Your Own), appears aimed in part at undermining morale and support for the war in Russia, where officials and state media have refrained from disclosing details of Russian casualties and military assaults against Ukrainian cities, including the capital, Kyiv.

Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, said the Russian government had been unresponsive about facilitating the return of Russian soldiers’ remains.

“For that reason, we have been forced to appeal to you, citizens of Russia, so that you can find those who were killed on our territory -- and killed because he illegally crossed our border based on an illegal and despicable order by your president,” Denysenko said in the video appeal, which the Ukrainian Interior Ministry posted on its official YouTube channel:

Russian authorities moved swiftly against the initiative's site, which was blocked by the government's media regulator the same day at the request of Russia's Prosecutor-General's Office.

The Russian Defense Ministry has yet to release information about the number of Russian soldiers killed, wounded, or captured since President Vladimir Putin launched the invasion of Ukraine on February 24.

The Ukrainian military on February 27 said that Russia had lost around 4,300 military personnel, though that figure did not include a breakdown of the number killed, wounded, and captured.

A day earlier, the Ukrainian military said that more than 3,500 Russian soldiers had been killed, though it was not possible to independently corroborate that claim.

Ruslan Leviyev, the founder of the nongovernmental Conflict Intelligence Team (CIT), an open-source investigative group focused on the Russian military, said his team estimates that at least 500 Russian soldiers have been killed in the conflict so far.

“The [Russian Defense Ministry] itself is not acknowledging a single loss -- not prisoners of war or those killed in action. It’s as if there aren’t any at all,” Leviyev told Current Time, the Russian-language network run by RFE/RL in cooperation with VOA.

Shortly after Leviyev’s interview on February 27, the Russian Defense Ministry issued its first admission of casualties, but gave no numbers on how many the Russian military had suffered.

“Unfortunately, there are dead and wounded among our comrades,” ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov was quoted by the state-run RIA Novosti news agency as saying.

WATCH: Amid claim and counterclaim about Russia's war in Ukraine, open-source intelligence analyst Ruslan Leviyev says Russia has suffered at least 500 killed so far.

'Mama And Papa, I Didn't Want To Come Here'

The URL for the website launched by Ukraine for Russians to identify their killed or captured relatives is called 200rf.com -- a reference to ""Cargo 200,” a code for the bodies of soldiers being returned. The bulk of the images, videos, and official documents of Russian soldiers are posted on an associated channel on the encrypted messaging service Telegram.

The photographs and videos include extremely graphic images of soldiers killed in battle, as well as on-camera interrogations of captured Russian soldiers.

In one post, a purported Russian POW is shown being allowed to inform relatives about his whereabouts. In another, a different alleged POW is asked if he has a message for his mother and father.

“Mama and papa, I didn’t want to come here. They forced me to,” the man says.

RFE/RL was unable to verify what kind of pressure the men in these videos may have been subjected to prior to giving on-camera statements.

Denysenko, the adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, claimed in his appeal to families of Russian soldiers on February 27 that Ukraine is treating war prisoners “very humanely.”

“No one is treating them badly. If necessary, we provide medical care. But your government took your relatives’ telephones away. They don’t have any way to contact you,” Denysenko said.

He added that as a paid service, parents could submit their own DNA information via the website for a test to determine the identity of soldiers killed in action.

A Lone Confirmed Death

Since the start of the war, there has been just one official confirmation of the death of a Russian soldier, but it did not come from Russia’s Defense Ministry. Instead, it came from the Moscow-appointed head of Russia’s volatile North Caucasus region of Daghestan.

Sergei Melikov, who had headed the region since October 2020, said in an Instagram post that Russian officer Nurmagomed Gadzhimagomedov, a native of Dagestan who served in Russia’s airborne troops, had died in combat and that he “received the tragic news with great regret.”

Melikov did not disclose how Gadzhimagomedov died.

An anonymous NATO official said between 7,000 to 15,000 Russian troops have died.

A pro-Kremlin tabloid this week ran a report that nearly 10,000 Russian troops have been killed.

NATO released a new estimate that up to 40,000 Russian troops have been injured, captured, or killed in the first month of Russia's war on Ukraine.

An anonymous NATO official spoke to media outlets including NBC and the AP, confirming the number. The official said that per NATO's most recent intelligence assessment, between 7,000 to 15,000 Russian troops have died in the conflict.

The NATO estimate aligns with an estimate released by US intelligence, which pegged the Russian death toll at around 7,000 people.

A senior US official told reporters on a conference call attended by NBC that it is difficult to give casualty counts because the US does not have boots on the ground in Ukrainian territory.

""I'm not going to characterize what the ranges are that we're looking at because they're just very broad and we continue to have low confidence in those estimates because we're not on the ground and can't see, you know, what's really going on on a day to day basis,"" said the official, who declined to be named.

However, the same official told reporters that Russian forces have faced many logistical issues, and are suffering from low morale.

The NATO estimate comes the same week that the pro-Kremlin tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda reported almost 10,000 Russian troops had been killed in the conflict. It cited numbers from the Russian Ministry of Defense saying 9,861 Russian troops had died, and 16,153 soldiers were injured. The story was later taken down.

Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, in an unprovoked assault that was the biggest military offensive in Europe since World War II. However, the last month has seen strong resistance from Ukraine, with reports of Russian tanks being destroyed and Russian troops suffering from frostbite because of inadequate gear. Ukraine also says it has killed at least five Russian generals.

""Some say a few weeks. Others — several years. Some say the war will last until the end of this year. And someone advises to prepare for a permanent confrontation with Russia as long as it exists,"" he said in his nightly address to the nation.

But Zelenskyy says the ""effectiveness of instruments of influence"" on Russia used by Ukraine as well as its entire anti-war coalition against Russia must be taken into account, when predicting how long the war will last.

""The success of our military on the battlefield is really significant. Historically significant. But not enough to clean our land from the occupiers yet. We'll beat them more,"" he said.

""Sanctions against Russia are very significant. Economically painful. But still not enough for the Russian military machine to be left without means of subsistence. We promote stronger, more destructive ones,"" Zelenskyy said.

These two areas, he says, will determine how long this war will last. The amount of support for Ukraine ""literally defines how many more Ukrainians the occupiers will manage to kill.""

""If someone says: year or years, I answer: you can make the war much shorter. The more and the sooner we get all the weapons we have requested, the stronger our position will be and the sooner peace will come,"" he said.

Ukrainian officials claim that between 4,500 to 5,300 Russian troops have been killed so far, although these figures could be overstated.

They also say they have taken out 29 aircraft, 191 tanks, 74 guns, 816 armoured combat vehicles, 21 multiple-launch Grad rocket systems, 291 vehicles and one Buk anti-aircraft missile system.

Hanna Maliar, Ukraine’s Deputy Minister of Defence, admits: “Information is approximate and may be clarified’. But such numbers only five days into this conflict are not far below the total fatalities for previous wars involving Russia.

In the first Chechen war, from 1994 to 1996, the official figure for Russian military deaths was 5,732, although other estimates put the number between 3,500 and 7,500. During the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, from 1979 to 1989, more than 15,000 soldiers died and 60,000 were wounded.

After invading along multiple axes, from Belarus in the north, the occupied regions in the east and occupied Crimea in the south, Russia currently controls parts of the Donbas region in the east, Crimea and the area north of it, as well as areas in the north around Chernobyl and Chernihiv.

Fighting is continuing in Kyiv after Ukrainian troops pushed back an assault on the city over the weekend, while rocket attacks killed dozens of people and injured hundreds in Kharkiv on Monday.

Anton Herashchenko, an adviser to Kyiv’s interior minister, said Russia had bombarded residential areas with Grad rocket missiles. “The whole world must see this horror! Death to the occupiers!” he added.

The plan was to capture Kyiv and other major cities within 48 hours, remove President Zelensky and install a puppet leader, British and Ukrainian defence sources believe.

But Mr Putin is yet to capture any of the country’s major cities after encountering fierce resistance from the Ukrainian troops, which have brought down Russian warplanes and tanks.

However, cities continue to be heavily shelled on Monday, even as peace talks began near the Belarussian border, with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky says next 24 hours will be a “crucial period” for his country as peace talks continue at Belarus border.

However, residents in Mariupol said the southern city, north of Crimea, was surrounded by Russian troops.

Russia’s defence ministry also claimed its forces had taken over the towns of Berdyansk and Enerhodar in Ukraine’s southeastern Zaporizhzhya region as well as the area around the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant, Interfax reported.

The plant’s operations continued normally, it said. Ukraine denied that the nuclear plant had fallen into Russian hands, according to the news agency.

There was fierce fighting around the Hostomel airbase outside Kyiv last week, and an explosion at an air base at Vasylkiv, just outside Kyiv.

However, fighting and explosions have also been reported as far west as Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk.

102 civilians, including 16 children, have been reported dead and hundreds wounded so far but the actual numbers are believed to be far higher.

The Russian Ministry of Defence spoke about the losses of the Russian army for the first time on Sunday evening but did not include numbers.

Ukrainian Major General Borys Kremenetsky said on Saturday that Ukraine had captured around 200 Russian soldiers who were “badly equipped”.

“We captured around 200 Russian soldiers, some of them 19 years old, not trained at all, badly equipped. We treat them according to Geneva Convention, according to international humanitarian law,” Kremenetsky, who is a defence official at the Embassy of Ukraine in the US, said.

Russia has moved to restrict social media and news sites on what they can report about its military losses in Ukraine. It comes after anti-war protests have broken out in cities across Russia since Thursday.

Russia has clamped down on social media and news sites, restricting Twitter and Facebook and issuing warnings to 10 media outlets including the Novaya Gazeta newspaper over the weekend, over veering from Putin’s specified narrative of the invasion as a “special operation”.

Roskomnadzor, the Russian communications watchdog, also warned of consequences for placing advertising messages with information about Russian military losses online, with fines of up to 5 million roubles.

Roskomnadzor said certain messages on Google ads “contain false information about the numerous victims among the Russian military personnel, as well as the civilian population of Ukraine”. and demanded that access to these messages be restricted.

Meta refused to remove posts about the war in Ukraine at the request of Roskomnadzor. In its transparency report, the company said that it received requests from the Russian regulator to remove seven posts calling for an anti-war action, one post condemning the war and four media posts with messages about the situation in Ukraine. After checking these posts, the company did not find violations in them.

News of Russian casualties is, however, making its way into Russia, and anger is growing, particularly from parents of soldiers sent to fight.

One father whose son, Rafik Rakhmankulov, 19, was captured in Ukraine on the first day of the invasion, gave an emotive interview to the independent Russian TV channel Dozhd, which has been branded a “foreign agent” by the state.

Rushan Rakhmankulov said he did not want his son to be used as “cannon fodder” and asked: “Why are oligarchs’ sons not serving?”

He said: “My niece sent me video and photos where Rafik is standing in the woods with another boy. Also I thought it was fake. I was reassured at work.”

However he said he had received confirmation of the news from the Committee for Soldiers’ Mothers.

His mother, Natalja Dejneka, told the BBC that her son, a combat engineer in the Fourth Guards Tank Division, did not know that he would take part in the invasion.

She last spoke with Rafik on February 23, when he told her that his division was close to the Ukrainian border.

“I asked him why he didn’t tell me they had been reassigned, to which he replied, ‘So you don’t have to worry.’ He also told me that everything was calm there. ”

When pictures of prisoners began circulating, Russia’s state TV channel called it “fake news.”

“Which doors do I have to knock on to get my son back,” she told Dozhd, adding that she had not received a clear answer from the authorities about what had happened to her son.

The Committee of Soldiers’ Mothers of Russia has claimed many of Putin’s soldiers were tricked into enlisting and told they were heading to the border for practice drills before being sent into bloody conflict.

“We’ve had a flurry of calls from scared mothers all over Russia. They are crying, they don’t know if their children are alive or healthy,” Andrei Kurochkin, the deputy chairman of the group, told Russian site Takie Del.

“If there is a war, then professionals should deal with it, not untrained green guys,’ he said, adding it was a “complete catastrophe” to have soldiers fighting a war “under duress.”

The Ukrainian authorities have set up a Telegram channel called Look for your Own, on which they are posting documents, photos and videos of captured and dead Russian soldiers.

In a video on the site, Viktor Andrusiv, an adviser to the Interior Minister, said: “I am talking to you in Russian because this site was created for you. I know that many Russians are worried about how and where their children, sons, husbands are and what is happening to them – so we decided to put this online so that each of you could search for your loved one who Putin sent to fight in Ukraine.”

There have been reports that Russia could be using mobile crematoriums to dispose of the bodies of dead soldiers and civilians to hide the true scale of losses.

Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, said on Thursday: “If I was a soldier and knew that my generals had so little faith in me that they followed me around the battlefield with a mobile crematorium, or I was the mother or father of a son, potentially deployed into a combat zone, and my government thought that the way to cover up losses was a mobile crematorium, I’d be deeply, deeply worried.”

He also warned that Russian setbacks could spell further violence yet: they are taking significant casualties and they are feeling public rejection in parts of the Russia system itself; we’ve seen many protests.

“But the Russian handbook is to then get more violent and commit more forces because fundamentally in the Russian doctrine…. The lives of their own soldiers matter much less than in other armed forces”.

In addition a number of weapons systems are also said to have been taken out of action, as well as 60 tankers used for refuelling Russian military vehicles, BBC News reports.

“Mom, I’m in Ukraine,” Sergiy Kyslytsya read out in Russian, from printed text messages that he said were the last conversation between a Russian soldier and his mother before he was killed. “There is a real war raging here. I am afraid. We are bombing all of the cities, even targeting civilians. We were told that they would welcome us… They call us fascists. Mama, this is so hard.”

Kyslytsya asked representatives to “visualize the magnitude of the tragedy” by imagining the “more than 30 souls of killed Russian soldiers” next to the nameplate of every country. “Just imagine those people next to you,” he said.

Since the beginning of Russia’s invasion, President Volodymyr Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials have repeatedly emphasized the tragic death toll of Russian soldiers, often expressing empathy for them and their families back home. They have described them as often misguided young conscripts, ill-equipped and tricked into fighting in Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war. As casualties have mounted, so have Ukrainian officials’ efforts to appeal directly to the Russian people, saying they are being lied to about a war Moscow still calls a “special operation”. More than 5,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or injured in the conflict, Western intelligence officials estimated on Tuesday.

As high-level talks in Belarus ended Monday without a ceasefire amid continued Russian shelling, Ukraine’s defense minister Oleksii Reznikov appealed directly to Russian troops in the country. “Russian soldier! You were brought to our land to kill and die,” he said in a statement posted on social media in which he offered full amnesty and monetary compensation if they laid down their weapons. “Don’t follow criminal orders.”

Reznikov emphasized that many of the Russian soldiers captured by Ukrainian forces are very young. “The Kremlin turns them into criminals, turns them into murderers… some of them were deceived, some were bombed with propaganda or intimidated,” he alleged, saying they were offering soldiers a chance to “start a new life.” But he ended with the warning: “For those who continue to behave like an occupier, there will be no mercy.”

This message has also been echoed in popular propaganda videos filmed by Ukrainian soldiers, mixing expletive-laden threats and bravado with dashes of sympathy. “You’re all young boys, you don’t want to die here,” one soldier says in a viral video purporting to be a message to Russian troops from “Kyiv’s Defenders.” “I know that very well. You have no idea where you’re going… So surrender, kiddos. We will feed you, give you water, no one will harass you. Unlike you, we don’t kill non-armed people.”

Kyiv has also tried to undermine domestic support for the war in Russia and to break through to the public there by appealing directly to the families of captured soldiers. As Russia continues not to disclose information about casualties, Ukraine’s Interior Ministry has set up an effort called Ishchi Svoikh, or “Look For Your Own,” for Russians to identify killed or captured relatives.

“I am talking to you in Russian because this site was created for you,” Viktor Andrusiv, an adviser to Ukraine’s Interior Minister, said in a video noting that the Russian government had not responded to their efforts to facilitate the return of their troops’ remains. “I know that many Russians are worried about how and where their children, sons, husbands are and what is happening to them—so we decided to put this online so that each of you could search for your loved one who Putin sent to fight in Ukraine.”

Through its website and its Telegram channel, the effort has posted videos of captured Russian soldiers. (The initiative’s website was immediately blocked in Russia, reportedly at the request of the country’s Prosecutor-General’s Office.) In some of them, Russian soldiers are filmed while being allowed to call home. This had the intended effect, with videos of demoralized soldiers being widely shared on social media and messaging apps. “Mama and papa, I didn’t want to come here. They forced me to,” a soldier says in one of the videos, a refrain repeated by several others.

Russian families who have recognized loved ones in these videos have expressed shock and anger, with many saying they had no idea they were fighting in Ukraine. The International Committee of the Red Cross declined to comment on whether these posts violate the Geneva Conventions, which regulate the treatment of prisoners of war, including the use of images of captured soldiers. A spokesperson for the ICRC told TIME that Russian prisoners “must be protected, particularly against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity.”

These efforts to publicize Russian soldiers’ whereabouts have grimly contrasted with previous reports, confirmed by the British Ministry of Defense, that Russia has prepared mobile crematoriums to use in the conflict. “If I was a soldier and knew that my generals had so little faith in me that they followed me around the battlefield with a mobile crematorium, or I was the mother or father of a son, potentially deployed into a combat zone, and my government thought that the way to cover up losses was a mobile crematorium, I’d be deeply, deeply worried,” British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace told The Telegraph.

Western officials have similarly adopted pointed rhetoric when referring to the conflict, placing it squarely on one man’s shoulders. In a call with reporters on Feb. 26, a U.S. administration official repeatedly referred to the conflict as “Putin’s war of choice.” When European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced a new round of crippling economic measures the following day, she also called it “Putin’s War.” In President Joe Biden’s address to the nation on Feb 24, he also spoke directly to Russians. “To the citizens of Russia: you are not our enemy,” he said, “and I don’t believe you want a bloody, destructive war against Ukraine.”

This tone was set by Zelensky himself who, in a televised speech on the eve of the invasion, spoke directly to the Russian people in their own language. “They’re telling you that this flame will liberate the people of Ukraine, but the Ukrainian people are free,” Zelensky said. “Ukraine on your TV news and the real Ukraine are two totally different countries… Do Russians want war? I would like to answer that question, but the answer depends only on you.”

It’s unclear what impact these efforts will have. There are indications that morale is sagging among Russian troops on the ground, with some surrendering without a fight and many running out of fuel and food, a senior U.S. defense official said Tuesday. But the Russian government is still fighting to control the narrative. It has throttled access to Facebook, blocked websites set up by the Ukrainian government, and reportedly ordered media outlets not to use words like “attack,” “invasion” and “war.” On Tuesday, Moscow moved further to stem the spread of what they called “deliberately false information” about its invasion of Ukraine, blocking in Russia an independent TV channel and a liberal radio station, and even threatening to block Wikipedia there.

Despite those measures, there are signs that the invasion is growing more unpopular, especially with the Russian economy facing catastrophic consequences. In rare and often risky shows of dissent, Russian anti-war protestors have demonstrated across the country, according to the Russian monitoring group OVD-Info. Almost 6,000 of them have been arrested.

For now, with negotiations stalled and mounting casualties on both sides, it’s clear that Ukrainian officials intend to keep trying to get through. Asked if he had a message for Russian soldiers on Sunday, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko told the camera “Go back home. You have nothing to find here.”

Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Malyar said on Sunday that the number of dead could be as high as 4,300, but it still needed to be clarified. She also said on her Facebook page that Russian troops lost about 146 tanks, 27 aircraft and 26 helicopters.

The news comes after Putin has been mocked by Ukraine after the nation has stood firm amidst 72 hours of bitter onslaught.

The conflict is now in its fourth day and Russian forces have taken out key oil and gas facilities, but the Ukrainian resistance remains intact.

Minister of Defence of Ukraine Oleksii Reznikov tweeted: ""72 hours of resistance! The world didn’t believe. The world doubted. But we did not just stand, we confidently continue to fight with Russian occupant! ""We showed the world - don’t be afraid of Russia, be strong & repel it! Support of Ukraine must be more stronger! Your safety depends on us!""
