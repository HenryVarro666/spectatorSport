A Police Public Relations Branch officer said three people were handed HK$5,000 fines for allegedly gathering in groups larger than two on Thursday evening. Separately, a 32-year-old man and a 31-year-old woman were arrested for failing to present their identity documents. Both were Ukrainian, police said.

The protest followed Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky‚Äôs calls for citizens worldwide to take to the streets and show solidarity with Ukrainians to mark one month since Russia invaded its eastern European neighbour.

‚ÄúThe world must stop the war,‚Äù Zelensky said, speaking in English in a video message on Wednesday. ‚ÄúCome from your offices, your homes, your schools and universities, come in the name of peace, come with Ukrainian symbols to support Ukraine, to support freedom, to support life.‚Äù

The protest in Central on Thursday was small in scale. Images showed a handful of people holding up Ukraine‚Äôs blue and yellow flag, with one woman carrying a sign that read ‚ÄúStop genocide in Mariupol,‚Äù referring to the southeastern Ukrainian city that has been devastated by bombings.

The month-long conflict has left Ukraine in ruins, with hospitals and apartment buildings bombed and residents forced to flee their homes. Thousands have died and millions have fled the country since Russia‚Äôs military invaded.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's testing tour of the Caribbean will spark an inquest when they return to Britain after becoming victims of series of 'avoidable' PR errors by rusty aides and republican politicians hijacking the couple's visit to push harder to remove the Queen as head of state, royal experts said today.

William and Kate were greeted as rock stars in Belize, Jamaica and now The Bahamas - with cheering crowds chanting 'we love you' - but they have also faced challenges in three nations with burgeoning campaigns for complete independence from the UK and demands for slave trade reparations.

A senior British diplomat supporting the Cambridges complained to the BBC today that criticisms of the tour had been 'really unfair' - but others claimed the royal couple and Britain had been 'humiliated' at times because of poor planning. Others insisted William and Kate will have 'expected dissent' because 'times have changed', especially because of the rise of the BLM movement, meaning the tour had gone well.

But there have been several missteps, including pictures of the couple shaking hands with black children through a wire fence in Trench Town, Jamaica. Yesterday the couple were accused of taking part in 'colonial-style' photo opportunity by riding around in a 1953 Land Rover inspecting troops, with William wearing military uniform.

And the future king was accused of being 'tone deaf' and not showing the 'courage' to apologise for the slave trade in a landmark speech. The opening event in Belize had to be postponed because of protests.

Royal author Tom Bower, most recently a biographer of Meghan Markle and Prince Charles, told MailOnline that the Cambridges had been badly let down by civil servants organising the trip on their behalf.

He said: 'I blame the officials at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office for the disaster. Incompetent, uneducated and lazy, they totally failed to anticipate the problems which William and Kate would encounter. The officials‚Äô ignorance exposed the couple to unnecessary embarrassment. The FCO‚Äôs misjudgement, just as in Afghanistan and elsewhere, has humiliated Britain'.

Other royal commentators believe difficult moments on the trip had been 'cruelly distorted' by those who oppose the monarchy to degrade what has been a successful first post-pandemic tour to further their republican campaigns.

Biographer Richard Fitzwilliams said: 'There is no need to think the sky is falling in'. He said it is 'by no means certain' Jamaica will vote to be a republic and 'will stay in the Commonwealth, whose next head will be Prince Charles. The likelihood is that William and Catherine will return in future years, with their children'.

Experts have said they believe there will be an inquest into what has happened. Royal biographer and Daily Mail columnist Robert Hardman believes that rustiness on behalf of the organisers could be partly to blame.

'I sense that because there haven't been any royal tours for a couple of years, everyone has got a bit out of practice, particularly on the planning front. I think there were glitches in the planning of this,' he said, adding: 'I think when they get back from this trip, a few questions will be asked'.

But BBC Royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said that the tour has been 'overshadowed by PR missteps'.

He said: 'It's been more than two years since the last tour and the Cambridges' team sorely lacks experience in setting up a long and complex trip. The whole fingers-through-the wire moment was avoidable. Black Lives Matter has changed many perceptions. And the declaration by Barbados of a republic late last year has changed things too. There is no longer the forgiveness there once was for the slightly tone-deaf moment'. He added: 'The Land Rover might have seemed like a good idea at the time. But on the day it felt like one more reminder of colonial days. Times have changed. The Royal Family have in the past been pretty good at changing with them. But not on this tour. And second chances are these days few and far between'.

Camilla Tominey, who is the Daily Telegraph's royal editor, believes the Cambridges were sent to the Caribbean by the Queen to 'fight a losing battle' when it was billed by the palace as a royal 'charm offensive'.

She said: 'The days of us accepting royals, walking around foreign climbs, not addressing the elephant in the room which is our imperialism and colonial past is over. William and Kate of course have to accept some of the dissent that they encounter when they go on these tours'. She added: 'The truth of the matter is, because of the Queen's performance on the throne and her solid support of Commonwealth Countries, she remains sacrosanct. Are there going to be more countries flirting with republicanism when we have King Charles III on the throne? Well, yes, maybe'.

Former BBC royal editor Peter Hunt was critical of William's Kingston slavery speech, which did not contain an apology. He said: 'Windsor caution wins the day. The defence is saying sorry is too political. The reality is William could have apologised for the active role his ancestors played in the slave trade. An opportunity to shape history has been ducked'.

William and Kate's Caribbean tour to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee, billed as a royal charm offensive, has been beset with controversy and helped reignite for republican calls in Jamaica for complete independence from Britain. MailOnline has asked the Foreign Office to comment on claims they are to blame for the planning.

Whoopi Goldberg calls on royal family to apologize for its colonial past and 'running roughshod over India for years' while discussing anti-monarchy protests New York City-based actress Whoopi Goldberg, 66, has joined the chorus of people calling on the royal family to apologise for its colonial past Whoopi Goldberg has joined the chorus of people calling on the royal family to apologise for their colonial past. The 66-year-old Sister Act actress, who is based in New York City, was discussing the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's tour of the Caribbean for ABC's popular talk show The View. Whoopi, who has been vocal about royal issues in the past, said that the modern royal family needs to apologise for its imperialist past and the British empire's links to slavery, saying the crown 'ran ram shod' over India for years and needs to take responsibility for its colonial past. Her comments come after Prince William, 39, delivered a heartfelt speech where he described Britain's historic role in the slave trade as 'abhorrent' and a 'stain on our history' in a keynote speech alongside his wife at a state dinner on Wednesday night in Jamaica. An animated Whoopi said: 'Let us not forget when we talk about what needs to happen, all the folks that need to apologise.' She did note that Prince Charles acknowledged Britain's imperialist past when he travelled to Barbados in November. Charles travelled to the country to attend a ceremony marking the end of the royal rule over the Caribbean island. 'Listen, this is not new. I suspect Charles when he was in Barbados, had some idea because he went on and apologised. Yes, he was releasing the hold that Britain has,' she added. While calling for an apology, the Ghost actress noted that the royal family has shown signs it is catching up with the times. 'So perhaps someone is listening, and it's the new group of folks. I don't know if it's Charles, but one of them,' she said. Advertisement

There will also be an inquest when they return to London after unfortunate photo calls that led to accusations they were echoing Britain's colonialist past rather a more down-to-earth future.

Yesterday they were driven in an open-top Land Rover during a military parade in Jamaica that some observers called 'absolutely awful'. Earlier in the trip there were unfortunate images of the couple greeting children pinned behind tall metal fences.

Professor Rosalea Hamilton, a civil rights campaigner and founding director of the Institute of Law and Economics in Jamaica, told the Mirror: 'These unfortunate images are a relic of the past and could have been taken in the 1800s. They signify this young generation is continuing the monarchical traditions of holding one race superior and another inferior'.

William used a speech in Kingston to roundly condemned Britain's 'abhorrent' history of slavery, calling it a 'stain on our history' as he expressed his disgust at the 'appalling atrocity' that has left such a heavy legacy in the Caribbean island. He expressed his 'profound sorrow' that the slave trade had ever happened, although he stopped short of a full apology, which is said to have upset the Jamaican government and its people. One group called it 'tone deaf'. A Jamaican MP said William lacked 'courage'.

William and Kate have flown into another storm in The Bahamas as islanders piled more pressure on the Royal Family over slave trade reparations amid a growing movement on Caribbean islands

The couple landed in Nassau last night after a bumpy visit to Jamaica that sparked protests and allowed prime minister Andrew Holness to further his campaign to become a republic. A visit in Belize this week had to be rearranged over fears it could be disrupted.

As they touched down at Lynden Pindling International Airport in Nassau, Bahamas, to begin the final leg of their tour, Prince William and Kate were met by members of the military and eight-year-old local resident Aniah Moss, who presented the couple with a bouquet of flowers in front of the Royal Air Force Voyager plane.

They then met country's Prime Minister Philip Davis, who gifted them a portrait and said their visit to the island was 'long overdue'. As Kate wore duck egg blue to match the country's flag, Mr Davis told them: 'And our best wishes are sent to the Queen, and congratulations on her Platinum Jubilee. I do not think we will see the same again', to which William nodded.

Mr Davis, avoided any discussion of independence, and said they talked about climate change, with the future king pledging to 'do all he can' to support their work to restore The Bahamas' coral reefs. Mr Davis said last year that an independence referendum was 'not on the agenda' but admitted that could change if voters demand it. But one of his senior ministers said recently it was his 'life's work' to be truly independent from Britain.

And on the eve of the Cambridges' arrival in The Bahamas, the island nation's National Reparations Committee called for millions of pounds to be paid in reparations for the British monarchy's role in slavery.

The incendiary letter read: 'They and their family of royals and their government must acknowledge that their diverse economy was built on the backs of our ancestors. And then, they must pay. We, the children of those victims, owe it to our ancestors to remember. We owe it to our ancestors to demand a reckoning and to demand accountability, healing, and justice.

'The Duke and Duchess may not be compelled to make such a declaration during their visit to our shores. They may not be able at this time to speak on behalf of the Queen and their government. However, they can no longer ignore the devastation of their heritage.

The committee added: 'We, the members of the Bahamas National Reparations Committee (BNRC), recognise that the people of the Bahamas have been left holding the bag for much of the cost of this extravagant trip.

'Why are we footing the bill for the benefit of a regime whose rise to 'greatness' was fuelled by the extinction, enslavement, colonisation, and degradation of the people of this land? Why are we being made to pay again?'

Beaming Queen uses a walking cane on official engagement after vowing she DOES 'hope to attend' Philip's memorial service despite claims she refuses to be seen using a wheelchair The Queen, 95, now uses a walking stick, confessing to mobility problems, and usually carrying out only light duties at Windsor The Queen was all smiles as she stood with her walking stick at an official engagement at her Windsor Castle home this week after it was revealed she hopes to attend a thanksgiving service to remember her late husband Prince Philip at Westminster Abbey next Tuesday. Elizabeth II - currently in residence at Windsor Castle - was pictured wearing half-moon glasses to examine luxury artefacts by British craftwork firm Halcyon Days, which is held in high esteem by the royal family and has three Royal Warrants. The official engagement marked the Queen's first in-person visit with a significant group of attendees since her pre-Jubilee reception last month when she was joined members of the local community in the Sandringham House ballroom in Norfolk. The 95-year-old monarch was due to visit the Halcyon Days factory in Staffordshire in 2020 to mark its own Platinum Jubilee of 70 years, but plans were put on hold when the pandemic struck - instead she was visited at her home on Wednesday. Royal aides recently announced details of The Duke of Edinburgh's upcoming service, which will 'give thanks to his dedication to family, nation and Commonwealth and recognise the importance of his legacy in creating opportunities for young people, promoting environmental stewardship and conservation, and supporting the Armed Forces'.

The royal couple also had an official meeting with the country's Prime Minister, Philip Davis, who passed on his best wishes to The Queen and said 'it's great to have you both here.'

They were welcomed to the Prime Minister's office by Mr Davis who introduced his wife Ann Marie, who told Kate 'delighted to meet you'.

The Duke and Duchess were introduced to a line up of dignitaries Myles Laroda, the minister of state and Leon Lundy, the parliamentary secretary in the office of the PM.

William and Kate then posed in front of a sign reading 'Office of the Prime Minister' before being led into a side room to have a private meeting.

Mr Davis told William: 'We have been looking forward to your arrival. It's long overdue. We are delighted you are here.'

William replied: 'Yes very much, excited to be here.'

Mr Davis said: 'And our best wishes are sent to the Queen, and congratulations on her Platinum Jubilee.

'I do not think we will see the same again', to which William nodded.

During the meeting, Mr Davis and his wife gifted the couple a hand painted portrait by local artist Jamaal Rolle.

The Prime Minister also posted a tweet welcoming William and Kate to The Bahamas.

He wrote: 'The Bahamas welcomes The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on the occasion of The Queen's Platinum Jubilee as they partake in a series of events within the country spanning the next three days.'

Kate wore a stunning aquamarine Emilia Wickstead dress to echo the Bahamian flag with a matching clutch bag, whilst William wore a suave blue suit, black lace-up shoes, and a white shirt.

The photo ops that backfired on William and Kate during their tricky Caribbean royal tour Children behind fences The Cambridges greeting Jamaican fans through a fence The Cambridges arrived in Jamaica to a much publicised demonstration calling on the monarchy to pay reparations for slavery on the island. Kingston-born England international Raheem Sterling received a rapturous applause whenever he touched the ball and there were screams for the duke - and a few ironic ones when he fluffed a shot. Dozens of locals stood behind a wire fence to watch the sporting spectacle unfold and others sat on roofs to get a better view. But critics were unhappy about pictures of Kate shaking hands with children through the fence. And the royals are likely to have been unhappy about the optics too. Meeting with the Jamaican PM The Prime Minister of Jamaica, Andrew Holness presents the Duke of Cambridge with a bottle of Appleton Estate Ruby during a meeting at his office in Kingston, where the PM almost immediately raised his wish to make Jamaica a republic Prime minister of Jamaica Andrew Holness was accused of ambushing the future king and his wife within seconds of welcoming them to his office in Kingston. Before the couple could sit down Mr Holness said Jamaica is 'moving on' and their royal visit was an opportunity to air his country's 'unresolved issues' before suggesting they will be the next country to break away from the monarchy. Prince William was left nodding politely as he listened to his two minute pre-prepared statement. After signing a visitors' book in the lobby, William and Kate were presented with an official gift of Appleton Estate Ruby rum. An aide to Mr Holness, who is said to have helped set up the meeting, has said that they and their colleagues were shocked. The insider told ITV's Good Morning Britain: 'The meeting was deeply embarrassing for Prince William', adding they 'felt incredibly sorry for him'. Trip in open top car The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge ride in Jamaica a vintage Land Rover used by Queen Elizabeth II in 1966 and again in 1994, as they leave a commissioning parade in Kingston on the sixth day of their Caribbean tour William and Kate recreated a photograph taken of the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh on the staircase when they visited in 1953. The now 95-year-old visited on her first Commonwealth tour as monarch when they were guests of the then-Governor, Sir Hugh Foot. But some observers called the optics 'absolutely awful'. Earlier in the trip there were unfortunate images of the couple greeting children pinned behind tall metal fences. Professor Rosalea Hamilton, a civil rights campaigner and founding director of the Institute of Law and Economics in Jamaica, told the Mirror: 'These unfortunate images are a relic of the past and could have been taken in the 1800s. They signify this young generation is continuing the monarchical traditions of holding one race superior and another inferior'. Advertisement

The couple earlier bid a fond farewell to Jamaica on what is possibly the last Royal visit to the island as a Commonwealth realm as their tour to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee headed north to The Bahamas.

Ahead of departing for their final destination, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge posted on their official Instagram account: 'What an amazing trip so far! Thank you Belize and Jamaica. Next stop, The Bahamas'.

Kate boarded the plane wearing an emerald dress made by London-based fashion designer Emilia Wickstead and a hummingbird brooch gifted to the Queen during her visit to Jamaica in 2002.

Flags were flown from the cockpit of a Royal Air Force plane while military personnel marched at a departure ceremony for the royal couple at the airport in Kingston, Jamaica's capital, on Thursday.

Earlier today, William quoted Bob Marley as he spoke at a military parade in Jamaica on day six of his Caribbean tour with Kate, saying: 'You never know how strong you are, until being strong is your only choice.'

The Duke wore his white Tropical Dress of the Blues and Royals and proudly displayed his military medals in Kingston, while the Duchess looked glamourous in a white McQueen dress and Philip Treacy hat.

The couple attended at the inaugural Jamaica Defence Force Commissioning Parade on the island nation for service personnel who have completed the Caribbean Military Academy's officer training programme.

And William said: 'You are graduating today as officers into an uncertain world. In your service ahead you will have to contend with climatic, geological, criminal and wider state and non-state threats to our collective safety, security and prosperity.

'Being asked to lead men and women through uncertainty and danger is daunting. 'You never know how strong you are, until being strong is your only choice'. From here the onus is on you to grow into the leaders you have been taught about in textbooks, watched on your screens and witnessed in your instructors.'

William also quoted the Queen, continuing: 'Good leadership is hard to define, but it's easy to recognise in others. As Catherine and I visit Jamaica in celebration of the Queen's Platinum Jubilee, I thought I might quote my grandmother on the subject.'

The Duke referred to her address to the United Nations General Assembly in 2010, in which she said: 'I know of no single formula for success, but over the years I have observed that some attributes of leadership are universal, and are often about finding ways of encouraging people to combine their efforts, their talents, their insights, their enthusiasm and their inspiration, to work together.'

Following today's parade, the Duke and Duchess travelled in the same open-top Land Rover that transported the Queen in 1966 and again in 1994.

Later this afternoon, the couple - whose children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis are at home in London - will be greeted by Philip Davis, the prime minister of The Bahamas.

Jamaican government insiders criticised William for failing to apologise for Britain's historic role in the slave trade ‚Äì despite calling the evil practice an 'appalling atrocity' and a 'stain on our history' during an address last night.

The duke denounced slavery as 'abhorrent', saying 'it should never have happened' as he addressed the issue following days of protests calling for reparations from the royal family.

William expressed his 'profound sorrow' at the forced transportation of millions of people from Africa to the Caribbean and North America ‚Äì a trade which British monarchs either supported or profited from during the 17th and 18th centuries.

Speaking during his visit to Jamaica with Kate, he echoed the words of his father the Prince of Wales and went on to acknowledge Jamaica's 'pain'.

The Cambridges' tour of Belize, Jamaica and the final leg in The Bahamas has prompted demonstrations and statements calling for an apology from the royal family. The future king did not say sorry, just as his father Charles had not during his trip to witness Barbados become a republic.

But he praised the Windrush generation of Caribbeans who arrived in the UK a few years after the Second World War to help rebuild the nation depleted by six years of conflict.

Jamaica's prime minister Andrew Holness appeared to suggest his country may be the next country to break away from the monarchy, telling the Cambridges it was 'moving on' and intended to 'fulfil our true ambitions and destiny as an independent, developed, prosperous country'.

The Independent has reported the Jamaican government has already begun the process to transition to a republic, with an official appointed to oversee the work.

Speaking during a dinner hosted by the Queen's representative in Jamaica, Governor General Sir Patrick Linton Allen, the duke said: 'Anniversaries are also a moment for reflection, particularly this week with the International Day of Remembrance of the Victims of Slavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade.'

Commenting on the sentiment expressed by Charles when he attended the Barbados ceremony that saw it become a republic in November, he said: 'I strongly agree with my father, the Prince of Wales, who said in Barbados last year that the appalling atrocity of slavery forever stains our history.'

'I want to express my profound sorrow. Slavery was abhorrent. And it should never have happened.

'While the pain runs deep, Jamaica continues to forge its future with determination, courage and fortitude. The strength and shared sense of purpose of the Jamaican people, represented in your flag and motto, celebrate an invincible spirit.

'It is this same spirit that spurred on the Windrush generation, who came to the United Kingdom to help rebuild after the Second World War.

'We are forever grateful for the immense contribution that this generation and their descendants have made to British life, which continues to enrich and improve our society.'

Elizabeth I was involved with one of Britain's first slave traders, John Hawkins, while Charles II encouraged the expansion of the industry and with his brother the Duke of York, later James II, invested their private funds in the Royal African Company, which transported Africans across the Atlantic.

As the slavery abolitionists campaigned they were opposed by the Duke of Clarence, George III's son, later to become William IV.

The royal and the rest of the pro-slavery lobby would eventually lose the battle when William Wilberforce and other abolitionists succeeded in passing the bill banning the slave trade in 1807.

William delivered his speech on Wednesday and for the second day the Cambridges' presence in Jamaica prompted protests, with around a dozen members of Jamaica's Rastafarian community demanding reparations from the royal family when the couple visited a military event near Montego Bay.

Ras Iyah V, a leading member of Jamaica's Rastafari Nyahbinghi community, said: 'We are here to protest against any British monarchy descendant coming to Jamaica without being prepared to apologise for slavery and colonialism.

'We can only forgive people who acknowledge that what they did was wrong and are willing to repair the breach of the wrongs they have committed.'

He added: 'And today the British monarchy has a lot of African artefacts in their possession ‚Äì they still bathe in the wealth that was extracted out of the blood, sweat and tears and lives of our people and we have never been compensated for any form of enslavement.'

During his speech at the black tie event William affectionately paid tribute to the Queen, whose Platinum Jubilee is marked by the Cambridge's Caribbean tour: 'She may be my actual grandmother, but everyone counts her as their grandmother too.'

And he recognised the plight of Jamaicans caught up in the conflict in Ukraine: 'Catherine and I were deeply moved by the plight of the Jamaican students who have recently returned safely from Ukraine.

'Their experiences are a reminder of the terrifying toll and inequality of war and conflicts across the world, which we must never forget.'

Kate was dressed in a green gown by British designer Jenny Packham paired with earrings and a bracelet that were loaned by the Queen and wore the Royal Family Order and her Dame Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order star.

Prince William's speech at military parade in Jamaica A speech by The Duke of Cambridge at the Inaugural Commissioning Parade of the Caribbean Military Academy Governor General, Prime Minister, Chief of Defence Staff of the Jamaica Defence Force, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, good morning. I am honoured to be here representing Her Majesty The Queen at the Caribbean Military Academy's first Commissioning Parade for the Initial Officer Training Programme. Congratulations to everyone on parade today. I have stood to attention myself on many parades as you do now, proud of my accomplishments, yet also hoping that the Reviewing Officer keeps the speech short. This is all the more important today as we bask in the glorious Jamaican sunshine! You all stand before me as seventy-seven officer cadets: from Jamaica, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Guyana, St Kitts and Nevis, Suriname and Uganda. However you are here today as one unit. You have formed friendships which will last a lifetime, and built a network of camaraderie and experience to call upon in the future. I know very well from my own time at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst what a formative experience this year will have been. Today you mark the successful completion of your training programme in the classrooms, on the parade squares and in the exercise areas. But remember, this is just the beginning. Because now the hard work really starts, as you join your units and assume command. You are graduating today as officers into an uncertain world. In your service ahead you will have to contend with climatic, geological, criminal and wider state and non-state threats to our collective safety, security and prosperity. Being asked to lead men and women through uncertainty and danger is daunting. 'You never know how strong you are, until being strong is your only choice'. From here the onus is on you to grow into the leaders you have been taught about in textbooks, watched on your screens and witnessed in your instructors. Good leadership is hard to define, but it's easy to recognise in others. As Catherine and I visit Jamaica in celebration of The Queen's Platinum Jubilee, I thought I might quote my grandmother on the subject. In an address to the United Nations General Assembly in 2010, she said: 'I know of no single formula for success, but over the years I have observed that some attributes of leadership are universal, and are often about finding ways of encouraging people to combine their efforts, their talents, their insights, their enthusiasm and their inspiration, to work together.' I think that's a very good model to follow. Let me also pay tribute today to the instructors and staff here at the Caribbean Military Academy for running this Initial Officer Training Programme. Putting on this international course for the first time was never going to be easy. And then you had to deliver it in the middle of a global pandemic. You should all be incredibly proud of your achievement, and of the young officers turned out so smartly in front of us today. I know how pleased the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst is to have helped you establish this course, and it's great to see the Commandant here today. Your collective collaboration and success is a testament to the continuing excellent defence relationship between Jamaica and the United Kingdom. And finally, I know how special it is to have your families join this celebration of your achievement. So I would like to thank all the guests for travelling here today. Were it not for your support and guidance, particularly given the additional challenges imposed by the pandemic, these cadets would not be here. I know you are beaming with pride. Congratulations again everyone. Advertisement

My Fair Lady: Kate Middleton channels Eliza Doolittle in head-to-toe white as she wears a custom-made lace Alexander McQueen dress and Princess Diana's bracelet for final engagement in Jamaica

By Jessica Green For MailOnline

Kate Middleton has channelled My Fair Lady's Eliza Doolittle in head-to-toe white for her final engagement in Jamaica.

The Duchess of Cambridge, 40, appeared effortlessly elegant in a custom lace Alexander McQueen dress as she joined Prince William at the Jamaica Defence Force Commissioning Parade on day six of their tour of the Caribbean.

Kate looked every bit My Fair Lady in the ensemble, which was reminiscent of the frilly white gown sported by Cockney flower-seller Eliza Doolittle ‚Äì played by Audrey Hepburn in the 1965 Hollywood musical - as she accompanies Professor Henry Higgins to Ascot.

The royal mother-of-three teamed her ensemble today with a stunning pearl bracelet that belonged to Princess Diana, while carrying her essentials in a ¬£395 Anya Hindmarch pearl-embellished satin clutch.

She completed her look with a sophisticated hat featuring floral details and matching white high heels.

Kate wore Princess Diana's bracelet (pictured). This isn't the first time the Duchess has opted to wear the piece, having worn it at a summer reception in Germany in 2017 and a G7 summit reception in June 2021

Adding even more glitz to her ensemble, Kate donned a pair of dainty pear earrings to match the bracelet that the late Princess Diana wore in 1989 (pictured) for an engagement in Hong Kong

This isn't the first time the Duchess has opted to wear the piece, having worn it at a summer reception in Germany in 2017 and a G7 summit reception in June 2021.

Kate, with her hair pulled back, oozed elegance thanks to her radiant dress, which featured a cinched waist thanks to a white belt and a square neckline.

With statement shoulders, the midi-length dress boasted stunning lace detailing along the skirt and top.

Kate finished her look with a smattering of glamorous makeup, including a deep blush and pink lips.

Looking equally sophisticated for the military parade, Prince William wore his Tropical Dress of the Blues and Royals and proudly displayed his military medals.
