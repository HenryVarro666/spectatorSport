One by one, diplomatic bridges between the United States and Russia are being set ablaze.

The latest bit of rhetorical demolition came when Joe Biden labelled Vladimir Putin a war criminal, a move that Russia said was ""unforgivable"".

Mr Biden’s statement was an odd one, albeit not out of keeping for a politician who has a history of making monumental policy shifts in seemingly off-the-cuff remarks (see, for instance, his comments on gay marriage in 2012).

After initially telling a reporter he did not think Mr Putin was a criminal, he came back and reversed himself. If there had been an internal debate at the White House over how to handle the growing calls in Congress and the press to condemn Mr Putin in this way, the president settled it in an aside, not a set-piece speech.

This, of course, will make it harder for Mr Biden and his administration to work with the Russians going forward. Every concession or negotiated agreement, on whatever topic, will invite the rejoinder: How can you associate with a criminal?

Perhaps Mr Biden, in his comments, was simply acknowledging the new reality - that the world's political order has irrevocably shifted, and there’s no going back to the way things were.",https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-60774819/page/11

The Russian army will attack any military cargo that will be delivered to the territory of Ukraine, said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in an interview with the Russian VT channel RT.

""We have made it very clear that any cargo that will enter the territory of Ukraine and which, we will assume, transport weapons, will become a legitimate target. This is completely understandable,"" the Foreign Minister said.

At the same time, Lavrov especially warned NATO countries against supplying Ukraine with S-300 missile systems developed during the Soviet era. The Russian Foreign Minister stressed that countries such as, for example, Slovakia, which openly declare their readiness to do this, do not have the right to do so. According to him, according to Soviet treaties, they cannot transfer weapons to third countries.

""This is a completely legitimate demand,"" Lavrov stressed.

NATO countries began supplying weapons to Ukraine even before the war began, when information about the upcoming invasion started appearing in the media. To date, military cargoes are delivered to Ukraine from the USA, Great Britain, Germany, Spain and other countries of the alliance. Logistics centers for the delivery of weapons are located in Poland.

The threat that Russia intends to attack convoys with Western weapons has previously been voiced by Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov. Then, his words were addressed to US President Joe Biden, who the day before announced that Washington was supplying weapons to Ukraine, including anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons.

""We warned the United States that the orchestrated pumping of Ukraine with weapons from a number of countries is not just a dangerous move, but an action that turns the relevant convoys into legitimate targets. We warned about the consequences that the thoughtless transfer to Ukraine of such types of weapons as portable anti-aircraft missile systems, anti-tank missile systems and so on could have,"" Ryabkov said at the time.

In response, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg warned that an attack by the Russian army on the supply lines of allied countries supporting Kyiv with ammunition and weapons would lead to a dangerous escalation of the war.

The war in Ukraine began on February 24 after the Russian army invaded the country on the orders of President Vladimir Putin. Moscow insists that the invasion is a ""special military operation"" to save residents of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics ""from genocide."" However, despite these statements, the Russian military continues to shell cities and towns outside these areas.

President Joe Biden warned Chinese President Xi Jinping that Beijing would face consequences if it provides “material support” to Russia amid its invasion of Ukraine, the White House announced Friday.

“President Biden detailed our efforts to prevent and then respond to the invasion, including by imposing costs on Russia,” said a White House readout of the call hours after it concluded.

“He described the implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia as it conducts brutal attacks against Ukrainian cities and civilians,” the WH added.

The White House has not detailed what those consequences would be.

Top Russian negotiator: Moscow & Kiev get closer on Ukraine’s neutral status

Moscow and Kiev have achieved certain progress in the ongoing talks, getting their positions on Ukraine’s potential status “as close as possible,” the head of the Russian delegation, Vladimir Medinsky, said Friday.

“The topic of neutral status and non-accession of Ukraine to NATO is one of the key issues of the negotiations. This is the issue on which the parties have brought their positions as close as possible,” Medinsky stated, adding, “Then details begin relating to what security guarantees Ukraine receives in addition to the already existing in case of its refusal to join the NATO bloc.”

Other questions however, namely Russian demands to “demilitarize” and “denazify” Ukraine, remain the subject of debate. The delegations are only “halfway” into finding common grounds on the former issue, Medinsky revealed, while the situation with the latter remains “rather strange,” with Kiev continuing to deny the very existence of neo-Nazis in the country.

“Ukrainian colleagues believe that there are no Nazi formations in Ukraine,” the official explained.

Ukraine’s negotiator at talks with Russia on Friday announced Kiev’s position was unchanged and it wanted peace negotiations to lead to a ceasefire, the withdrawal of Russian troops and security guarantees

US: Russian soldiers don’t appear to be “particularly motivated” about Ukraine war

Russian soldiers do not seem “to be particularly motivated,” Gen. Frank McKenzie, the Commander of US Central Command, told reporters during a briefing at the Pentagon Friday.

Putin tells Macron Russian troops are doing everything they can to save civilian lives

In another phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron, Russian President Vladimir Putin stressed that during the special operation in Ukraine, the Russian Armed Forces are doing everything they can to save the lives of civilians, the Kremlin press service announced.

It added that the presidents had continued to exchange opinions on the situation around Ukraine.

“Responding to the concerns voiced by Emmanuel Macron, the Russian president emphasized once again that during the special military operation the Russian Armed Forces are doing everything they can to save the lives of civilians, including through organizing humanitarian corridors for their safe evacuation,” it said.

The president drew Macron’s attention “to numerous war crimes committed on a daily basis by Ukrainian forces and nationalists, in particular massive missile and artillery strikes on Donbass cities,” according to the Kremlin.

Macron told Putin he is “extremely concerned” about Mariupol

French President Emmanuel Macron has told his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, that he is “extremely concerned” about the situation in Mariupol, which has been hit by constant shelling over recent days, according to the French presidential office.

The call lasted just over one hour, the Elysee added.

“The [French] President again brought up the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine, the continued strikes hitting civilians and failure to respect humanitarian law while negotiations between the Russian and Ukrainian delegation have for now not led to any progress,” according to Macron’s office.

UN: 6.5 million displaced inside Ukraine due to war

The UN migration agency estimates that nearly 6.5 million people have now been displaced inside Ukraine, on top of the 3.2 million refugees who have already fled the country.

Zelensky: 130 rescued, ‘hundreds’ under Mariupol theatre rubble

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated that 130 people had been saved after the bombing of a theatre in the port city of Mariupol under Russian siege, but “hundreds” were still trapped in the rubble.

Ukraine accused Russia of hitting the theatre on Wednesday. It had been feared that up to 1,000 people may have been taking refuge underground at the time of the blast. Russia has denied responsibility for the attack.

Western states say Russia using UN to spread propaganda

Russia is using the UN Security Council to spread disinformation and propaganda about its invasion of Ukraine, six Western members states have stated.

They made the allegation at a council meeting called at Russia’s request to discuss its allegations that Ukraine is developing biological weapons.

“Russia is once again attempting to use this council to launder its disinformation, spread its propaganda, and justify its unprovoked and brutal attack on Ukraine,” the six countries with seats on the council said in a statement read out by US ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield.

She was accompanied by representatives of France, Norway, Albania, Ireland and Britain.

Dutch & Germans to send 3 Patriot missile defence systems to Slovakia

The Dutch government has said it would send a Patriot missile defence system to Sliac, Slovakia, as part of NATO moves to strengthen air defences in Eastern Europe.

“The worsened safety situation in Europe as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine makes this contribution necessary,” Defense Minister Kajsa Ollongren said in a statement.

Germany is also sending two Patriot systems to Slovakia, the statement said.

Ukraine says Russian forces not made fresh advances

Ukraine’s Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Malyar has said Ukrainian troops had prevented Russian troops from making any fresh advances.

Speaking on national television, Malyar added Russian forces had food and fuel supply issues and communications problems.

The Armed Forces of Ukraine have also issued an upbeat assessment of their defense of Kyiv, saying Russia’s two main routes for attacking the capital city have been blocked.

In the face of a campaign to apparently encircle the capital ahead of a possible attempt to take it, Russian forces on both sides of the Dnipro river — which divides the city north to south — have been stopped, according to Oleksandr Hruzevych, deputy chief of staff.

“As of today, the enemy has been stopped at a distance of almost 70 kilometers (about 43 miles) from the city’s right bank, which makes it impossible to carry out fire, except for rocket fire. On the left bank, the advance has [also] been stopped. The enemy is cynically shooting at our infrastructure facilities. [But] the main ways of attack are blocked,” he said Friday.

Russian forces had abandoned offensive actions around Brovary to the northeast of Kyiv, and Boryspil to the southeast, Hruzevych added. After creating two lines of defense to protect the capital, Hruzevych noted Ukraine’s army was now “working on strengthening a third, distant line of defense.”

Xi tells Biden: “Conflict not in anyone’s interest”

Conflict and confrontation is not in anyone’s interest, Chinese President Xi Jinping said to US President Joe Biden on a video call Friday morning, according to Chinese state media.

“State-to-state relations cannot go to the stage of military confrontation. Conflict and confrontation are not in the interests of anyone. Peace and security are the most cherished treasures of the international community,” CCTV quoted Xi as saying on the call.

China and the US have a responsibility to ensure peace, Xi told Biden.

“As permanent members of the UN Security Council and the world’s two largest economies, we must not only lead the development of China-US relations down the correct path, but also shoulder our international responsibilities and make efforts for world peace and tranquillity,” Xi is reported to have said on the video call.

“The world is neither peaceful nor tranquil,” Xi acknowledged, adding, “The Ukraine crisis is something we don’t want to see.”

Lavrov warns Russia will target any weapons shipments entering Ukraine

Putin: Main goal of Russian operation in Ukraine is to set Donbass free from genocide

Setting free the people of Donbass from the “genocide” being waged against them is the main goal of the Russian special operation in Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin stated on Friday.

“[The Donbass residents], who did not agree with the [2014] coup [in Kiev], were immediately hit with punitive military operations. A blockade was immediately put in place against these people. They were subjected to systematic shelling, air strikes. This is what is called ‘genocide’,” he continued.

UN: At least 816 civilians killed in Ukraine since conflict began

The UN rights office (OHCHR) said on Friday that at least 816 civilians had been killed and 1,333 wounded in Ukraine through to March 17.

Most of the casualties were from explosive weapons such as shelling from heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes, OHCHR added.

The real toll is thought to be considerably higher since OHCHR, which has a large monitoring team in the country, has not yet been able to verify casualty reports from badly-hit cities like Mariupol.

NATO chief says 100k US troops now in Europe

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has announced that there are now 100,000 US troops in Europe as NATO ramps up its presence on the bloc’s eastern flank amid Russia’s ongoing special military operation in Ukraine.

Stoltenberg argued that the number of American servicemen in Europe has increased by several thousand over the past few weeks and that they remain on “heightened alert”.

EU has ‘very reliable evidence’ China considering military support for Russia

EU leaders are in possession of “very reliable evidence” that China is considering military assistance to Russia, a senior EU official told POLITICO, threatening potential trade measures if weapons’ deliveries go ahead.

It follows a similar warning from US officials earlier this week that the Russian government had asked China for military equipment and other support.

“EU leaders have very reliable evidence that China is considering providing military aid to Russia. All the leaders are very aware of what’s going on,” the senior EU official stated on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak publicly about confidential information.

He did not say what kind of assistance Moscow had requested.

“We are concerned about the fact that China is flirting with the Russians,” he added.

The EU will “impose trade barriers against China” should Beijing proceed with Russia’s request, he noted, as “this is the only language Beijing understands.”

Ukraine president says he expects progress on EU membership bid within months

President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he spoke with the head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and Ukraine expects progress to be made on its application to join the EU in the coming months.

The deputy chief of staff of Zelenskyy has also said Ukraine will not abandon its bid to join the EU to reach a compromise with Russia as part of an agreement to end the war.

“I will be categorical, this is absolutely unacceptable. It is our choice, the application for EU membership has been submitted and now it is being put into practice,” deputy chief of staff Andrii Sybiha added.

Speaking on national television, Sybiha stated negotiations with Russia were ongoing but difficult.

Russia’s request to suspend World Cup playoff rejected

The Court of Arbitration for Sport on Friday refused to suspend FIFA’s ban on Russia taking part in the playoffs for the 2022 World Cup finals that was imposed over the invasion of Ukraine.

The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) is still to rule on the legal basis of the ban, but a decision is not expected for several weeks at least.

“The challenged decision remains in force and all Russian teams and clubs continue to be suspended from participation in FIFA competitions. The CAS arbitration proceedings continue,” the court announced in a statement.

The Football Union of Russia had appealed against the suspension, hoping to gain permission to allow Russia to face Poland in a World Cup playoff that was due to have been played on March 24.

UN refugee agency says fewer Ukrainians fleeing

A UN refugee agency official said on Friday that daily crossings by people fleeing violence in Ukraine have slowed in recent days, noting warmer weather might be a factor.

“We have seen a slowdown, a general slowdown,” stated Matthew Saltmarsh via videolink from Poland, adding that warmer weather might be a factor.

However, he warned that any escalation of violence in the Western Ukrainian city of Lviv might cause crossings to rise again.

At least 3.25 million refugees have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion, the United Nations announced Friday.

India defends purchases of Russian oil

Indian government officials on Friday defended the continued buying of Russian oil, saying European countries were still purchasing hydrocarbons from Moscow and that high crude prices left New Delhi with little choice.

Indian oil refiners have in recent days reportedly purchased several million barrels of discounted Russian oil even as the West seeks to isolate Moscow economically over its invasion of Ukraine.

But an Indian government official stated on Friday that the world’s third-biggest consumer of crude relied on imports for almost 85 percent of its needs, with Russia supplying a “marginal” less than one percent of this.

“Geopolitical developments have posed significant challenges to our energy security. For obvious reasons, we have had to stop sourcing from Iran and Venezuela. Alternative sources have often come at a higher cost,” the official noted on condition of anonymity.

Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Kremlin says Biden’s remarks about Putin amount to “personal insults”

US President Joe Biden’s remarks about his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin amount to personal insults, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday.

“Moscow hears and sees what is already daily statements made by President Biden, which are already, in fact, personal insults of Putin,” Peskov told reporters on a regularly held conference call.

Speaking at the annual Friends of Ireland Luncheon on St. Patrick’s Day in Capitol Hill on Thursday, Biden said Putin was “a murderous dictator, a pure thug,” who is waging an immoral war against the people of Ukraine.”

Peskov added that he didn’t want to react harshly to these statements in view of Biden’s “irritability, fatigue and forgetfulness” and so as “not to cause more aggressiveness.”

“Taking into account President Biden’s irritability, fatigue and forgetfulness, which lead to such aggressive statements, we will not give sharp assessments of his words, so as not to cause more aggressiveness,” he continued.

Biden’s comments Thursday came a day after he first called Putin a war criminal — a significant escalation in his rhetoric condemning the Russian leader’s actions against Ukraine.

Peskov told reporters on Thursday Biden’s comments were “absolutely unacceptable and inexcusable.”

World Food Programme says supply chains ‘falling apart’ in Ukraine

A World Food Programme (WFP) official announced on Friday that food supply chains in Ukraine were collapsing, with a portion of infrastructure destroyed and many grocery stores and warehouses now empty.

Putin tells Scholz Kyiv stalling peace talks with Moscow

Russian President Vladimir Putin told German Chancellor Olaf Scholz during a phone call on Friday that Kyiv was attempting to stall peace talks with Russia but that Moscow was still keen to continue negotiations.

“It was noted that the Kyiv regime is attempting in every possible way to delay the negotiation process, putting forward more and more unrealistic proposals,” the Kremlin said in a readout of the call.

“Nonetheless the Russian side is ready to continue searching for a solution in line with its well-known principled approaches,” it added.

Scholz called for a ceasefire in Ukraine during the phone call with Putin, a German government spokesperson said.

In their nearly hour-long conversation, Scholz also stressed that the humanitarian situation needed to be improved and progress needed to be made in finding a diplomatic solution as soon as possible, added the spokesperson.

Putin has also complained of Ukrainian attacks in eastern Ukraine during the phone call with Scholz, the Kremlin has said in a statement.

According to Moscow, Ukrainian missile launches targeted residential areas in the cities of Donetsk and Makeyvka, and resulted in a “significant number of human casualties”.

“These war crimes have been ignored by the West,” the statement added.

FM: Russia’s illusions about West are over

Moscow has lost all illusions about relying on the West and Moscow will never accept a view of the world dominated by a United States that wants to act like a global sheriff, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said.

He expressed hope that the current “abnormal” situation between Russia and Ukraine will be resolved, but warned that the West is going to prevent this from happening.

Elaborating on the influence that Western countries have on Ukraine, Lavrov pointed at the allegations of biological weapons being created in the Eastern European country under US supervision.

The West will continue to impose sanctions on Russia but Moscow is used to it, Lavrov stated.

“The sanctions drive is going to continue and they are threatening the fifth wave. Maybe there will be another wave but we are used to it,” he noted.

“As President [Vladimir] Putin recalled, we are now champions in the number of sanctions introduced against the Russian Federation, more than 5,000 individual acts, almost twice as many as was introduced against Iran and North Korea. But sanctions always made us stronger,” Lavrov pointed out.

The foreign minister noted that there is no such thing as independent western media, adding that “we are not closing the door to the west – they are closing the door”.

He also claimed that the Kremlin’s goal is to remove any threat to Russia on Ukrainian soil.

Russia suspects Pentagon-funded bioresearch laboratories in foreign nations, including those in Ukraine, may pose a threat because of the secrecy surrounding their work, Lavrov told RT. Washington apparently didn’t want to risk exposing its own people to the pathogenic threat, he suggested.

“The Americans some years ago decided that it was too dangerous to do [such research] on their own soil. So, they moved all these threatening and dangerous activities to other countries,” Lavrov claimed.

Lavrov stated that, in his assessment, there were more than 300 biolabs worldwide involved in research for the Pentagon. He noted Russia does not rule out the possibility that Ukraine could be the Pentagon’s largest bio-laboratory project.

Macron: Russia’s offensive in Ukraine is ‘electroshock’ to NATO

Russia’s ongoing military offensive in Ukraine has delivered an “electroshock” to NATO, France’s President Emmanuel Macron said. The remark came in response to a journalist’s question regarding the president’s 2019 characterization of the military alliance as “brain dead,” and whether the French head of state was still of that opinion.

Macron added that he stood by his initial ‘diagnosis,’ taking “full responsibility” for his words; however, according to the French president, Russia’s military campaign against Ukraine has been a wake-up call for NATO.

Macron pointed out that the “war launched by President [Vladimir] Putin” at the alliance’s doorstep created an “unusual threat which gives a strategic clarification to NATO.”

He also stated that the military alliance in its current form would not cut it, standing by his earlier calls for reform.

Pope calls Ukraine war a ‘perverse abuse of power’ for partisan interests

Pope Francis has called the war in Ukraine a “perverse abuse of power” waged for partisan interests which has condemned defenceless people to brutal violence.

His latest condemnation came in a message to a Catholic Church conference in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia.

Ukraine FM says he discussed further Russian sanctions with EU’s Borrell

China maintains independent stance on Ukraine crisis as US threatens backlash for supporting Russia

Beijing adheres to an independent position on the Ukrainian crisis, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Friday, commenting on Washington’s threats to take action in event of China’s support for Russia. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday that US President Joe Biden will make clear to his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, during their phone call scheduled for Friday that Beijing will face consequences for supporting the Russian operation in Ukraine. “Regarding the Ukrainian issue, China has always made independent judgments based on the merits of the case in an objective and fair manner,” Zhao told reporters. Some people in the US continue to spread false information, slander, and pressure China, which is extremely irresponsible behaviour that does not help resolve the crisis, the diplomat added.

Ukraine: Russia lost 14,200 servicemen

Ukraine’s Defense Ministry has announced that Russia lost some 14,200 servicemen since the invasion began on February 24, including about 200 in the past 24 hours.

UK: “Faltering” Russian troops face logistical challenges like food shortages

The Russian military continues to face logistical problems in its “faltering invasion of Ukraine,” Britain’s Ministry of Defence announced in a statement.

In its latest intelligence update, the ministry said Russian forces were being prevented from resupplying “forward troops with even basic essentials such as food and fuel,” due to their inability to control Ukrainian airspace and challenges on the ground.

Russian forces have been reluctant to maneuver across the country, the ministry added, but did not provide additional details on its knowledge of Russia’s strategic moves.

“Reluctance to maneuver cross-country, lack of control of the air and limited bridging capabilities are preventing Russia from effectively resupplying their forward troops with basic essentials such as food and fuel,” the ministry said.

“Incessant Ukrainian counterattacks are forcing Russia to divert large numbers of troops to their own supply Iines. This is severely limiting Russia’s offensive potential,” it added.

White House cites ‘high concern’ China may provide Russia with weapons

The White House has announced it had “high concern” that China could provide Russia with military equipment to aid its invasion of Ukraine, and President Joe Biden would be candid and direct in an upcoming phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said China’s failure to denounce Russia’s actions “speaks volumes”.

Biden and Xi will discuss Russia’s invasion of Ukraine Friday, according to a White House statement released Thursday.

Biden will warn Xi on Friday that he will face “costs” if China rescues Russia from intense Western sanctions aimed at punishing Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

The phone call — the first known discussion between the two leaders since November — comes after recent assertions from US officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, that Russia has asked China for military support in Ukraine. Beijing and Moscow have both denied the claims.

Blinken said China bears “responsibility” to use its influence with Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop the war in Ukraine.

“We continue to call on all nations, especially those with direct influence with Russia, to use whatever leverage they have to compel Moscow to end this war of choice. We believe China in particular has a responsibility to use its influence with President Putin and to defend the international rules and principles that it professes to support,” Blinken stated.

“Instead, it appears that China is moving in the opposite direction by refusing to condemn this aggression while seeking to portray itself as a neutral arbiter. And we’re concerned that they’re considering directly assisting Russia with military equipment to use in Ukraine. President Biden will be speaking to President Xi tomorrow and will make clear that China will bear responsibility for any actions it takes to support Russia’s aggression and we will not hesitate to impose costs,” he added.

Ukrainian biolabs continue to destroy biological materials and documentation on the research of dangerous viruses, Kirillov noted.

“Information continues to be received about attempts to destroy biomaterials and documentation in laboratories in Ukraine. We know that during the liquidation in the laboratory of veterinary medicine in the settlement of Khlebodarskoye, working employees, citizens of Ukraine, were not even allowed into the building,” he continued.

Ukrainian Defense Ministry laboratories in Kiev, Odessa, Lvov and Kharkov received $32 million funding from the US, Kirillov had claimed.

China calls US, NATO initiators of Ukraine crisis

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian on Thursday refuted US State Secretary Antony Blinken’s accusations that China’s unwillingness to condemn Russia’s “special military operation” is inconsistent with China’s position on the UN Charter.

China always stands for respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries and abiding by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, Zhao noted during a regular press conference.

Blinken’s China-smearing remarks fully revealed the US side’s Cold War mentality and bloc confrontation thinking, Zhao said, adding that such remarks will not help solve the problem.

On the Ukraine issue, China has always adopted an objective and fair attitude and made judgments independently based on the merits of the matter itself, the spokesperson reiterated, adding that China believes the security concerns of all countries must be taken seriously and supports all efforts that are conducive to the peaceful settlement of the crisis.

As a responsible, major country, China will continue to play a constructive role in maintaining world peace and stability, Zhao said.

He stated the US government’s decision on NATO’s eastward expansion is directly related to the current Ukraine crisis and stressed that the key to solving the crisis lies in the hands of the US and NATO.

As the initiators of the crisis, the US and NATO should reflect on their role in the crisis, effectively assume responsibility, and take practical action to de-escalate the situation and solve the issue, Zhao continued.

He also called on the US to work together with the majority of the developing countries in the world, stand on the side of peace and justice and promote the early de-escalation of the situation in Ukraine.
