NASA FIRMS satellite imagery is designed to track forest fires. Turns out, it’s also great at letting us know what’s happening on a battlefield.

I added the bigger, highlighted city names for better readability. Other than one fire northwest of Kyiv, that whole front is quiet. We know that Ukrainian troops are mopping up after Russia’s withdrawal. That lone fire could be an isolated skirmish, or it could be Ukrainians blowing up unexploded munitions and landmines. Chernihiv is also quiet, along with Sumy. There is action south and southeast of Kharkiv, where we know Ukraine is on the counter-offensive. As we’ve discussed in previous updates (here and here), Ukraine is within reach of cutting off a major supply route to Russian forces attempting to encircle Ukraine’s defensive positions on the Donbas front.

Speaking of Izyum, which Russia reportedly took today, it’s dead quiet. Always so weird to see things so calm after weeks of action. The rest of the Donbas front is on fire, as it has been every day of this war.

North of Kherson, we see fires on the roads up to Kryvyi Rih, in that ill-fated and quite stupid attempt to reach up to it. We know Ukraine is rolling back that front, and the fires suggest that Russia is actually trying to defend their captured territory. There is also fire in Kherson proper for the first time in a while. The Pentagon has been hinting at partisan activities for days (“Russia isn’t fully in control”), though there hasn’t been any confirmation or evidence of it anywhere I’ve found.

The biggest surprise? The road between the Russian cities of Melitopl, between Kherson and Mariupol, and Vasylivka, to its north, is suddenly lit up.

The road between Melitopol in the south, and Vasylivka is suddenly on fire.

Vasylivka is the edge of Russian-held territory in the area. just south of Ukrainian held Zaporizhzhia. I’m not seeing anything on Twitter or Telegram suggesting Ukrainian counter-offensive actions in the region, but these fires are all new, and the fact that they hug this highway suggests ambushes or something larger. We’ll definitely keep an eye on the region in the coming days. Meanwhile, to the east of here, Mariupol continues to hang on. Rubble makes great defensive positions for urban defenders. So long as they have food and ammo stored, they might be able to hold out indefinitely. There was speculation early on that the city, preparing for war, had stashed away food and ammo in underground tunnels, and could fight for a while—thus tying up the Chechen TikTok army indefinitely.

The Ukrainian counteroffensive is gaining effectiveness. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said in its last report that local troops successfully launched several attacks around Kyiv and Kherson. This progress also represents an additional difficulty for Russia’s attempt to reorganize its forces and redirect efforts to eastern Ukraine, a move that has been underway since Friday of last week. Ukrainian forces could recover even more territory in the coming days, according to the ISW. Some analysts believe that Ukraine has retaken more territory over the last week than it has lost.

Ukrainian activity went beyond local assaults. Before dawn on Friday, two Ukrainian helicopters struck an oil depot in the Russian city of Belgorod, some 20 miles (40 km) from the border, according to regional authorities there.

In Kyiv, the counterattacks coincided with a withdrawal of Russian troops from Brovary for redeployment on other fronts. For several days now, Putin’s army has also been bringing in some of its forces serving abroad. The UK Defense Ministry’s intelligence services view this apparently improvised restructuring of resources as a sign of Russia’s difficulties and of the losses it has suffered since the beginning of the invasion on February 24.

In the north, the Ukrainian counteroffensive has taken back Sloboda and Lukashivka along the axis between Chernihiv and Kyiv, according to the latest UK intelligence update.

In the east, Russian forces have regrouped to advance from Izyum to Donetsk and Luhansk, where air operations have intensified, according to Ukraine. Kharkov continued to sustain shelling, but Russian troops did not take any further territory in the last 24 hours.

In the south, the Ukrainian resistance took back the towns of Orlove, Zagradivka and Kochubeyevka, north of Kherson. In the port city of Mariupol, Russian troops continued to slowly take additional territory, and the ISW reiterated that the city could fall very soon.

March 31 | New shelling but no advance

Russian forces continued to shell major cities, including the capital Kyiv, Chernihiv and Kharkiv. Despite Moscow’s claims that it would scale back operations and focus on the eastern region of the Donbas, recent attacks appeared to be targeting key infrastructure in these cities, such as fuel storage sites, in order to inflict damage on Ukraine’s logistical operations, said regional authorities.

Fighting continued in Brovary, northeast of Kyiv, and there was movement of Russian troops in a northern direction, possibly signaling a redeployment to other axes of advance, said the Institute for the Study of War (ISW).

There was significant Russian shelling and missile strikes around Chernihiv, according to the UK Defense Ministry’s intelligence update, and also around Kharkiv, where around 15% of buildings have been destroyed, according to the mayor.

In the east, Ukrainian forces repelled several Russian attacks in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, according to the ISW. Further south, on the shore of the Sea of Azov, Russian troops continued to take territory in Mariupol, and reportedly have much of the city under their control.

Although Russia has not launched any clear offensives in the last few days, the ISW noted that it has been deploying support personnel and auxiliary units to replace combat losses. It is still unclear how the new strategy will play out.

According to the Ukrainian General Staff, the death of Russian officials is impeding the army’s ability to reorganize and find replacements.

March 30 | Russian troops still near Kyiv

The Russian army is maintaining its positions near Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, despite the strategy change announced by the Kremlin last week, when it said the focus would shift to the eastern Donbas region. According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), “Russian forces continued fighting to hold their forwardmost positions on the eastern and western Kyiv outskirts even as badly damaged units withdrew to Russia from elsewhere on the Kyiv and Chernihiv axes.”

The Russians continued to actively resist Ukrainian counteroffensives in Irpin and Hostomel, according to the ISW. There were troops in the areas of Bucha and Nemishyev, northwest of Irpin, and artillery fire was being aimed at Ukrainian positions north and west of the capital. There were strikes against Makariv and Irpin, which were shelled on Tuesday.

However, both the ISW and the UK Defense Ministry believe that the Russian offensive has failed in its attempt to encircle Kyiv, at least for now. Russian statements and reports of Russian troops retreating into Belarus might indicate that Russia has accepted the loss of initiative in the region.

Russia intensified its efforts in northeast Ukraine, probably to try to connect its positions southeast of Kharkiv and Izium with its forces in the eastern Luhansk region.

In the east, the Russian advance in Mariupol continued to gain ground. According to the ISW, the city could fall within days.

March 29 | Russia not giving up on Kyiv

Ukrainian troops may have regained control of Irpin, a suburb located northwest of Kyiv, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) and the Ukrainian General Staff. This would be the third area to be controlled by local forces around the capital in the last week. Maintaining this position will be key in the effort to repel the Russian troops that reached the outskirts of the capital from the Dnipro River.

Despite the Kremlin’s announcement that it was shifting its focus to the eastern Donbas region, the Russians do not appear to have given up on their attempts to encircle Kyiv.

Along the Chernihiv-Sumy axis, which is being used by Russian troops to advance towards Kyiv, the Ukrainian counteroffensive has achieved some results. Following several days of fighting in Brovary, Ukraine appears to have stalled the Russian forces and regained control of Rudinstke.

This may be happening, according to the same sources, because Ukrainian defenders are taking advantage of ongoing Russian force rotations. Russian troops have barely made any progress in recent days as they work to resolve logistical issues. According to the ISW, “Russian conscription efforts, which Ukrainian intelligence expects to begin on April 1, are unlikely to provide Russian forces around Ukraine with sufficient combat power to restart major offensive operations in the near term.”

In the east, Russian forces continued to bomb Kharkiv, the second-largest city in Ukraine, but made no significant gains and did not launch ground attacks. According to UK intelligence reports, the Russians may already be deploying a private mercenary group known as the Warner Group, whose members have combat experience in Syria and Lybia. Their presence had been noted earlier, but it was thought that the group was made up of small units. Now, over 1,000 fighters are expected to be deployed in the eastern area alone.

In the south, Russian troops continued to make gains in Mariupol, the Ukrainian General Staff admitted. However, the Russians have reportedly suffered “great losses.”

March 28 | Slow Russian advance

In the first hours since Russia changed its focus (it says it will now concentrate on the Donbas region), the only progress made by troops was near Mariupol, where they were said to be trying to capture the port, according to the UK Defense Ministry’s intelligence update. The city, which has been withstanding heavy attacks for a month, is a key location to control access to the Sea of Azov.

In northern Ukraine, fighting continued outside the capital, Kyiv, where loud explosions were heard before dawn, according to The New York Times. There have been several Ukrainian counterattacks in the areas of Brovary in the east and Irpin in the west. Two weeks ago, Russian advances in these areas suggested an imminent attack on the capital, but this has not yet happened, presumably due to Russia’s logistical problems.

The eastern front is taking on special relevance following the Kremlin’s strategy change. There were reports of recent fighting in Sumy and Izyum, where the Russians were moving south while the Ukrainian defense was holding out in the north, “likely hindering Russian capabilities to resume offensive operations in the southern direction,” according to the ISW.

March 27 | No change in sight

Although the Russian Defense Ministry said on Friday that efforts would be focused on the Donbas region, an assessment by the ISW did not observe any changes to Russian activities near Kyiv. According to this research institute, troops continued to try to secure positions from which to attack or encircle the Ukrainian capital. Allies and the Ukrainian government were also wary of Russia’s announcement.

Two missiles hit Lviv, 60 kilometers from the Polish border, on Saturday. And the UK Defense Ministry said on Sunday that the Russian air force continued to attack targets across Ukraine.

The battleground in northern Ukraine was largely static, said the UK intelligence report. In those areas, counterattacks are hindering Russian attempts to reorganize. On Saturday, Ukrainian forces launched small counterattacks near Kharkiv, in the northeast.

In the east, UK services said they believed that Russian forces are being concentrated in order to try to surround Ukrainian troops in the Donbas, advancing from Kharkiv in the north and Mariupol in the south.

The ISW believes that Mariupol may come under Russian control soon. Fighting continued in the city, and Russian forces continued to sustain significant losses.

March 26 | A change in strategy?

Reports varied regarding the situation on the fronts. Russian forces on Friday said they intended to reduce their military targets and shift their focus to the Donbas region. However, an assessment by the ISW questioned this statement and considered it an attempt to adjust the narrative so that Russia’s limited progress of the past few weeks will look like it was part of the plan.

The news agency Reuters on Saturday said that reports of intense fighting in different parts of the country suggest that there will be no swift end to the conflict. Two missiles struck Lviv on Saturday afternoon, producing large columns of smoke. The mayor confirmed that the attacks damaged an industrial facility used for fuel storage and injured five people.

There was also fighting around Kyiv. The ISW registered minor progress by Ukrainian counterattacks north of the capital, with images confirming the presence of local troops in parts of Irpin that were earlier under Russian control. Invading troops were also forced back around Brovary.",https://english.elpais.com/international/2022-03-30/the-ukraine-war-in-maps-russia-has-not-given-up-its-attacks-on-kyiv.html

As the Russian military operation in Ukraine continues to deepen, casualties are rising on both sides. The conflict has so far resulted in thousands of civilian deaths and about 2.5 million Ukrainian have left their country, according to the United Nations, and the humanitarian crisis continues to grow. Though the wave of condemnation of Russia by the West is growing, none of them is willing to help the wrestling parties calm down and cease fire.

The Western media has bombarded the public with sensational and even fabricated news and battlefield scenes, but none has offered explanations over the real causes of the war. The media has portrayed Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky as a hero and Ukraine the only victim of the conflict, and demonized Russia as an evil ""invader"". In order to mislead viewers, Radio France Internationale used a photo of Zelensky visiting the eastern border of Ukraine in military uniform in the face of Russian aggression. However, it was proved that the photo was actually taken a few years ago.

US President Joe Biden claimed that the attack on Ukraine was definitely an ""unprovoked and unjustified attack."" But he did not mention the fact that it was NATO that promised Ukraine the membership and pushed the front line to the door of Russia, threatening its national security. As John Mearsheimer, a professor at the University of Chicago, said in an open lecture that he believed ""all the trouble in this case really started in April, 2008, at the NATO Summit in Bucharest, where afterward NATO issued a statement that said Ukraine and Georgia would become part of NATO."" The immediate trigger is that Zelensky approved the Azov Battalion, a military organization in the Donbass region, to persecute the civilians in Donbass with extreme cruelty. These actions, therefore, directly led to the military actions of Russia against Ukraine.

We have a saying in Chinese: ""When something goes wrong, there must be a demon."" As the world's peace-loving people are calling for ceasefire, the US government is making full use of Russia's military actions instead, and encouraging its allies to add more fuel to the fire by supplying destructive weapons to Ukraine. At the NATO summit in Brussels this March, Biden said that since he became president, the United States has committed more than $2 billion in military equipment to Ukraine, and now the air defense systems, anti-armor systems, ammunition and weapons are flowing into Ukraine. He also appealed to his European allies to support Ukraine in its defense.

Obviously, it is a war engineered by the US, whose aim is to encourage Ukraine to start a manageable and limited war, and kill three birds with one stone: to force the European capital flow back to the US stock market, to strengthen US' leadership in NATO, and to embarrass China to take side between Russia and Ukraine, knowing that choosing either side would hurt China's national interest. The biggest beneficiary of the war is US, not Europe, but the latter, however, has to pay a heavy price for it. By creating a permanent tension in Europe, Europe would be subjected to US domination of Europe.

US ambition does not stop there. China is also the target of US in Russia-Ukraine war. By pretending to stand on the ""moral high ground"", the US could achieve it calculation: as a traditional friend and neighbor of Russia, if China condemned Russia, it would alienate it; if China chose to stand with Russia, it would hurt the image of China in the world. To US' disappointment, China, as a responsible country, has chosen to stand on the side of justice and morality and avoided the trap laid by the US. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken threatened that China would be held accountable for any action it takes in support of Russian aggression. Reuters quoted Blinken as saying that China had a responsibility to use its influence on Putin to defend international rules, but Beijing appeared to be ""moving in the opposite direction"". However, Washington offered no evidence that China had expressed a willingness to help Russia.

Since the very beginning, the Chinese government has been calling for restraint from both sides, and has offered humanitarian aid to Ukraine. After the first batch of humanitarian aid worth 10 million yuan to Ukraine, the Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said on Sunday that the Chinese government has decided to provide another batch of humanitarian aid worth of 10 million yuan to Ukraine, and China will continue to play a constructive role in easing the situation in Ukraine and is willing to take its own efforts to overcome the humanitarian crisis.

At the same time, China has explicitly condemned the deeds of some Western countries that are calling for a halt in the fighting publicly while providing weapons to Ukraine behind the scenes. Such duplicity does nothing good but escalates the scale of war and humanitarian crisis. Unfortunately, the British government decided to provide Ukraine with 6,000 anti-tank missiles and anti-personnel demolition systems, as well as 25 million pounds in military aid. As expected, the sanctions initiated by the US and its allies failed to pressure Russian economy to crash, and the idea of paralyzing a power like Russia once for all is even naive and crazy.

As expected, these sanctions have backfired. The natural gas prices in Europe and US has skyrocketed, American public rancor is mounting and their anger is hard to be calmed down, deep rooted domestic problems are still ignored, partisanship is intensifying. European allies are forced to dream different dreams. Self-induced dollars crisis is deepening. BRICS countries are choosing to get closer for security.

Against this background, what Western countries should do to show their real concern to the conflict should see Russia's security anxiety from their perspective, and evaluate the potential toll if the war escalates. As the behind-door manipulator of the war, the US should stop thinking the world in the Cold War mentality, stop engaging in any activities that may obstruct normal communication and negotiations between warring sides. Most important, US politicians should reflect on the mess they have made all over the world in the past decades, especially the humanitarian disaster they have caused in Iraq, Libya, Syria and Afghanistan, and becoming a responsible and credible superpower is only the choice for a better world.

After all, a peaceful and stable world is to everyone's interest, for the world has already suffered a lot from the pandemic and bigger challenges such as the global warming are waiting for us ahead. Human being have to bear in their mind that wars bring us nothing but more hatred and wars as history has already proved.

A curated weekday guide to major national security news and developments over the past 24 hours. Here’s today’s news.

RUSSIA, UKRAINE – FIGHTING

Two low-flying attack helicopters swept over the southern Russian city of Belgorod today, firing rockets and blowing up a fuel dump, according to Russian media. Local governor Vyacheslav Gladkov immediately blamed Ukraine for the attack. Robyn Dixon reports for the Washington Post.

Eight tanks of fuel are on fire at the oil depot in Belgorod in Russia, and there is a threat of the fire moving to eight more, Russian state news outlet RIA Novosti has reported the emergency services as saying. BBC News reports.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has said that the Ukrainian strike against a fuel depot in Belgorod has not created comfortable conditions to continue peace talks with Kyiv. Reuters reports.

Ukrainian officials are reporting gains made outside Kyiv and in the southern Kherson region. In the Kyiv region Ukrainian forces have “freed” the town of Vyshhorod, presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said on Telegram. In the southern Kherson region, 11 towns and villages have been taken by Ukrainian forces, he added. BBC News reports.

Hundreds of Syrian fighters are en route to join Russian forces in Ukraine, effectively returning the favor to Moscow for helping President Bashar al-Assad crush rebels in an 11-year civil war, according to two people monitoring the flow of mercenaries. The first contingent of at least 300 soldiers from Syria has already arrived in Russia for military training. Ben Hubbard, Hwaida Saad and Asmaa al-Omar report for the New York Times.

RUSSIA, UKRAINE – HUMANITARIAN CORRIDORS, REFUGEES AND DEPORTATIONS

Evacuations from the besieged city of Mariupol are planned for today after dozens of buses ready to transport civilians arrived in the city yesterday. Matt Viser, Dalton Bennet, Alex Horton and Paulina Villegas report for the Washington Post.

A small International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) convoy of just three vehicles has left Zaporizhzhia, travelling towards Mariupol with the aim of trying to facilitate the evacuation of civilians from the besieged city, after receiving security guarantees from all sides. Wyre Davies reports for BBC News.

Around 2,000 civilians are on evacuation buses heading from the coastal city of Berdyansk to the Ukrainian government-held city of Zaporizhzhia, carrying civilians evacuating from Mariupol. “The evacuation convoy left Berdyansk for Zaporizhzhia,” Mariupol city council have said, adding that they “expect the arrival of a record number of Mariupol residents.” Olga Voitovych and Maria Kostenko report for CNN.

Russian forces yesterday confiscated 14 tons of humanitarian aid from buses bound for Melitopol in southern Ukraine, according to Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk. Russian forces also blocked 45 buses going to Berdiansk on Thursday en route to Mariupol, she added. CNN reports.

RUSSIA, UKRAINE – U.S. RESPONSE

President Biden yesterday announced that he will tap up to 180 million barrels of government oil reserves to help bring down prices. The oil release would be the administration’s third, and by far the largest ever, drawdown from the country’s emergency stockpile of roughly 568 barrels. Timothy Puki, Tarini Parti, Collin Eaton report for the Wall Street Journal.

The U.S. yesterday announced further sanctions against nearly three dozen Russian companies and individuals that the Treasury Department said are helping Moscow evade the West’s economic pressure campaign and aiding the country’s defense and intelligence agencies. Among those blacklisted include Russia’s largest microchip manufacturer, Mikron, a firm named Serniya Engineering that the Treasury said oversaw a network of companies that procured technology and dual-use goods from abroad for the military and intelligence services, and supercomputer company T-Platforms. Some of the firms named in the announcement have been identified as shell companies set up to evade prior U.S. sanctions. Ian Talley reports for the Wall Street Journal.

​​U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has decided that U.S. military members deployed to Europe following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, will stay in position there for “a while longer,” Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said during a briefing yesterday.

More than a month after the UK's Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme was launched, thousands of sponsors are still waiting to welcome Ukrainian nationals, amid reports of red tape and bureaucracy in the process.

Lynette Protheroe, from Derbyshire, was matched with sisters Yana and Inna and their three children on 20 March but weeks after submitting an application, she says she still has no way to track its progress.

""The system is shambolic and it is failing these people,"" Ms Protheroe told Sky News.

""You can order some balloons from China and you can track it and you know where it's coming from, you know where it is.

""You can generally tell when it will be delivered. You cannot track these visa applications. There's no way the family can track them. You just have to wait.""

The Florida Forest Service Everglades District said the L-30 fire has burned more than 13,800 acres and is 65 percent contained as of Saturday afternoon. Service rangers remain on the scene monitoring activity but all are reported safe.

The fire spread north from Krome Avenue in Miami-Dade County toward the Broward County line. It’s now located near U.S. 27 and Pines Boulevard.

The fire is contained in an area surrounded by water and levees and isn’t a threat to homes or businesses.

“We’re praying for rain right now,” said boater Scott Weinstein. “The fire is dangerously close to the C-11 canal here, which is where Everglades Holiday Park is operating their airboat tours. I think when it gets a little bit closer, they’ll probably close the park.”

Ash fell from the sky and the smell of smoke is enveloping some communities as crews continue to battle one of a few brush fires that broke out in South Florida this week. NBC 6’s Kim Wynne reports

The city of Weston urged residents with respiratory issues to monitor the air quality index.

Officials said the fire – although massive and scary to see up close – is just part of life in the Everglades.

“We do want the public to know this is part of a cycle, that the Everglades burns and it’s good for the vegetation and the wildlife, it grows back relatively quickly,” David Rosenbaum of the Florida Forest Service said Friday.

Strong winds made it the second wildfire South Florida has seen in the last three days. A brush fire in southwest Miami-Dade, first reported Tuesday, charred more than 600 acres so far. It is currently 85% contained.

Some residents said as long as it doesn’t get near residential areas, there shouldn’t be a reason to panic.

“It’s natural, you know. That’s nature taking it’s course, that’s what it’s supposed to do,” said fisherman Dennis Short. “As long as nobody gets hurt, you know, everything is good.”",https://miamistandard.news/2022/04/02/this-is-part-of-a-cycle-everglades-brush-fire-brings-concern-for-local-residents/
