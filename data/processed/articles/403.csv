The “Deck” in White Plains, N.Y., as it is known to local bridge players, is running three afternoon card games a week — on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays — and averaging about seven tables a session as the main spot in the area for playing cards in person.

With the COVID-19 threat lessening by the day, it is hoped that this club, as well as others like it all over the country, will see their attendance rise so that in-person duplicate bridge will once again thrive as the preferred form of the game for competitive bridge players.",https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Bridge-in-Greenwich-The-Deck-is-the-place-to-be-16945320.php

And the most picturesque way to do it? Well, the most touristy way is a quick visit to Capilano Suspension Bridge Park, but our favorite way is hiking in Lynn Valley and Lynn Canyon.

We’ve been living 15 minutes drive away from the North Vancouver rainforests, and have visited them countless times. This post was born from our love for them and to help you plan an unforgettable visit here. (Lynn Valley trail maps and parking suggestions are also included.)

The Lynn Valley hiking trails are not just usual forest trails, they are jaw-dropping! With lush green carpets of moss and fern, lichen hanging from the centuries-old cedar, fir or hemlock trees, rushing, crystal clear creeks and pretty waterfalls, these rainforests are truly out of a fairy tale. And there’s a trail for everyone here, whether you’re looking for an easy stroll, an adventurous hike or a stroller-friendly path.

Three parks connect with each other and provide maintained paths, information boards, picnic areas, parking lots and washrooms (toilets) in the area: Lynn Canyon Park, Lynn Headwaters Regional Park and Lower Seymour Conservation Reserve. They’re free to visit.

Easily reachable beauties in Lynn Canyon Park

While the Capilano Suspension Bridge Park owns the longest suspension bridge in Vancouver, it can only be visited if you pay the (not very cheap) entrance fee. However, there’s a free suspension bridge in Lynn Canyon Park, swinging 50 meters above roaring Lynn Creek and offering fabulous views of Lynn Canyon.

Lynn Canyon Park is one of the best natural attractions in Vancouver, anyway. With Lynn Canyon Suspension Bridge, incredibly turquoise Lynn Creek, charming Twin Falls and Thirty Foot Pool, you really couldn’t ask for more from a city park. And you don’t even need to hike too much to see all of them, a few hours are enough to conveniently explore these sights. However, be prepared to climb a few hundred wooden stairs.

Both the Twin Falls and Thirty Foot Pool trails start from Lynn Canyon Cafe. The Twin Falls loop is about 45 minutes walk, the Thirty Foot Pool trail is about 40 minutes there and back, and you can easily connect the two. The suspension bridge is included in both routes as it’s in the middle.

Twin Falls loop trail

The Twin Falls loop is the harder of the two, because it involves a few hundred stairs. But as a hiking trail it’s easy, you don’t even need hiking boots on the well-established path (unless it’s pouring rain). It’s just not a flat forest walk, and certainly not wheelchair accessible.

The Twin Falls can be seen from the bridge above it (it’s not the suspension bridge, that’s upstream from Twin Falls), but for the best front view continue the trail downstream after crossing the bridge. Climb down to the bank of Lynn Creek on a steep detour (not marked on trail maps, but quite obvious once you’re there), and halfway down you’ll get your perfect view of Twin Falls (don’t climb over the fence, stay behind it). Then you’ll get impressed by the emerald water rushing through Lynn Canyon from up close when you reach the bank. Twin Falls can’t be seen from the bank though.

Hiking essentials Trailhead: Lynn Canyon Cafe Length: 1.2 km loop Difficulty: medium (there are a few hundred wooden stairs to climb) See the trail map here!

Thirty Foot Pool loop trail

You can reach the Thirty Foot Pool by passing the Lynn Canyon Suspension Bridge and hiking upstream along Lynn Creek. The pools have an incredible turquoise color, and there’s a large area that’s suitable for picnicking while admiring the pools. It’s a swimming hole, too, in the summer, but beware that the water is extremely cold even then.

You can return the same way, but we recommend continuing on the long stairway after the Thirty Foot Pool. The forest is spectacular, and you can have another great view of Lynn Canyon from the Pipe Bridge. You can cross the bridge and make it a loop, but we like returning on the same way as the trail is further from Lynn Creek on the other side, and a short section of the path is actually walking on Lynn Valley Road.

Hiking essentials Trailhead: Lynn Canyon Cafe Length: 2 km return Difficulty: easy (though there’s a longer stairway) See the trail map here!

Ecology Centre

You can stop by the Ecology Centre when hiking in Lynn Canyon Park, it’s right next to Lynn Canyon Cafe and the visitor center. It offers exhibits about the flora and fauna of temperate rainforests, and educates you about environmental concerns. You can also get information about the trails here. Entrance is by donation.

Where to park your car?

Lynn Canyon Park has a paid parking lot with a maximum 3 hours limit. It’s a few minutes walk from the Ecology Center and the Lynn Canyon Suspension Bridge, and if you only spend an hour or two in the park, this might be your best option (if you find available spots).

But there are other options, too. Peters Road and Duval Road are also close to the suspension bridge, and you can park on the streets for free wherever it’s not prohibited. Parking signs tell you clearly whether parking is allowed, not allowed or allowed with permit only. You can also find free street parking on Lynn Valley Road.

If you’d do a longer loop trail which includes other sights, like Rice Lake or Norvan Falls, simply choose another parking lot and start your loop there. There’s Rice Lake parking lot, Lynn Headwaters Entrance parking lot, Cedar Mills Trail parking, Lillooet-Clearwells Trailhead parking or a small dirt parking lot where Lillooet Road crosses the Baden Powell Trail.

None of them have a time limit, but they don’t allow overnight parking, so make sure to leave before they close the gate for the day. Lynn Headwaters Entrance and Cedar Mills Trail parking lots belong to Lynn Headwater Regional Park, and they are paid parking lots in the summer season (from March until October).

Easy trails along Lynn Creek in Lynn Headwaters Regional Park

North of Lynn Canyon Park, the Lynn Headwaters Regional Park gives access to the upper section of Lynn Creek and several challenging routes into the wilderness. First, let’s see the shorter creekside trails.

Why are they worth a visit? Because Lynn Creek and the rainforests are fabulous, and these trails are not nearly as busy as the ones in Lynn Canyon Park, but you can easily connect with them since the two parks are neighbors.

Varley Trail loop (trail map here) is 3.5 km, easy and can be done in about an hour. You can connect it to the Thirty Foot Pool trail so that you see even more of Lynn Creek. Varley Trail is on the west bank of Lynn Creek and offers a few creekside access points. The trail on the other side makes it a loop hike, but the forest is not as spectacular as on the west side. Start this loop from the Lynn Headwaters Entrance or the Cedar Mills Trail parking lots. They’re paid parking lots from March until October, free in the winter months.

Lynn Loop Trail is a 7.2 km loop in the rainforest with several river viewpoints (click here for the trail map). There’s a steeper section, but it’s still an easy trail overall. If you’d prefer staying close to Lynn Creek, continue on Cedars Mill Trail, it’s 8 km there and back – see it here. In any case, it’s best to start from Lynn Headwaters Entrance parking.

Half-day hike in the rainforest to Norvan Falls

However, our favorite hike in Lynn Headwaters Regional Park is Norvan Falls. It’s not that short, but relatively easy, with only a few hundred meters elevation gain all the way, but with occasional steeper slopes, creek crossings or rugged terrain. It takes about half a day to hike to Norvan Falls and back.

The route includes part of the Lynn Valley Loop and Cedar Mills Trails along Lynn Creek, then continues on Headwaters Trail. It means you’ll get all the beautiful river views and access points, an enchanted rainforest and 30 metres tall Norvan Falls at the end. You can even cross the creek to get closer to the waterfall if water levels are low enough.

A leisurely stroll around Rice Lake in the Lower Seymour Conservation Reserve

Now here’s a place that feels so out in the wild, yet it’s easily accessible to everyone. If you use the Rice Lake parking lot at the top of Lillooet Road, then the trail to Rice Lake and the loop walk around the lake are wheelchair accessible all the way, including the pier that offers the best views of Rice Lake and the surrounding mountains. It makes this a nice walk for mums with a stroller, too.

Side note: it’s not an alpine lake. It’s lovely, but it’s in a different league. 🙂

Rice Lake loop hiking essentials Trailhead & parking: Rice Lake parking lot Length: 3.1 km loop Difficulty: very easy See the trail map here!

You can connect the Rice Lake loop trail with the Thirty Foot Pool and Twin Falls trails if you hike downstream along Lynn Creek, or the Varley Trail and other trails of the Lynn Headwaters Regional Park if you hike upstream. Or you can hike both upstream and downstream a bit to make a nice ~8 km loop in the area – as you see it on this trail map.

Magical rainforests of the Lower Seymour Conservation Reserve

Even though this park doesn’t include any section of Lynn Creek, its trails are connected to both Lynn Canyon Park and Lynn Headwaters Regional Park. It offers about 100 km of hiking and biking trails, mostly through old-growth rainforests that look absolutely stunning.

Our favorite rainforest walks are quite short and easy: the Mystery Creek & Hyannis loop (3.6 km loop, trail map here) and the Homestead Trail & Twin Bridges Trail loop (4.7 km loop, trail map here). They make you feel like being in a giant, quiet, green cathedral decorated with thick moss and lichen, pristine little creeks and rushing Seymour River. Any of the loops are suitable for beginner hikers and families with small kids, too. My 2.5 years old Tomi actually hiked both of these loop trails all the way (not on the same day).

Full day hikes to explore the North Vancouver rainforests

In case you have a full day to experience Lynn Canyon, the creeks, lakes and rainforests that North Vancouver offers, you can start hiking in the morning and not stop until dusk comes (and the park gates close).

Lynn Canyon & Lynn Headwaters day hike

One of our suggestions for a day hike is a path that includes Twin Falls, Thirty Foot Pool, Rice Lake and Norvan Falls. It’s about 22 km and looks like this. If you start at Lynn Canyon Cafe and drive there, then park on the street on Lynn Valley Road or nearby, since the official Lynn Canyon Park lot has a 3 hours limit. You can also start from the Rice Lake parking lot, or any of the parking lots in Lynn Headwaters Regional Park. Lynn Headwaters has paid parking in the summer, but there’s no time limit (other than the gate closure at the end of the day).

Baden Powell Trail

This is a historic route that runs through all three parks and crosses the entire North Shore from Horseshoe Bay (in West Vancouver) to Deep Cove (in North Vancouver). It was constructed by the Boy Scouts and Girl Guides of Canada to celebrate the 100 year anniversary of British Columbia’s entry as a province into Canada. The full route is a 45.5 km point to point trail, but you can break it into sections. Like one piece from Deep Cove to Grouse Mountain via Lynn Canyon is a nice, challenging day hike.

Things to know before you visit

How to access the parks?

You can reach them by public transport, but it’s quicker by car. Once you’re out of Vancouver Downtown, public transport is not that frequent and convenient, and getting (free) parking is usually manageable, so we visit North Vancouver by car.

However, parking lots can fill up quickly on good weather days, especially on weekends. Some parking lots have time limits (max. 2 or 3 hours), and some of them are pay parking lots. You can opt to park on the street in North Vancouver, just make sure it’s allowed. Some streets are only for parking with permit, or one side of the street is with permit, the other is for everyone. These things are posted clearly everywhere, so pay attention to the signs. You find tips where the best parking place is for the specific trails in the post.

Bear safety

What?! Inside the city? Yes. Vancouver is a fascinating city with wildlife, like coyotes and bears. We haven’t met any of them so far, and it’s not that surprising, because most of these trails are busy, and wild animals avoid humans if they can. Also, they are the most active at dusk and down, so make sure you finish your hikes before darkness falls.

However, bears and other wild animals can get attracted to an area if they get used to finding food there. So make sure to use the provided trash bins for all of your waste, including any kind of food waste. These bins can all be closed in a way that animals can’t access the food inside them. By not leaving food in the outdoors and not feeding any wildlife you protect both yourselves and your fellow hikers, and the animals.

In case you do encounter a bear, stay calm and don’t run. Don’t turn your back on the bear, give them space, speak in a calm voice and slowly back away. You can carry bear spray as a last resort, but bears rarely attack humans. They’re usually more afraid of you than you’re of them. 🙂

Which is the best time of the year to visit?

You can hike these trails year-round. They’re usually snow free, except for a few weeks in December or January when you can enjoy a snowy rainforest with half-frozen waterfalls. Microspikes come handy if the trails are icy. This short snowy period is an exception though, most of these trails are located at such elevation which doesn’t usually get snow. But since rainforests are evergreen, it’s beautiful to hike here in the winter months, too.

With that said, keep in mind that Vancouver is the rainiest between November and March. And you can expect a few rainy days any time of the year during your visit. There’s a reason temperate rainforests thrive here, after all. But don’t let rain scare you away from exploring these trails. Dense forest trails are actually one of the best options on a rainy day. For more tips to have an enjoyable hike in the rain, read this one (yes, we’ve written a full post about it; we live here, we have to cope with it).

Where to stay?

Exploring Downtown Vancouver is the most convenient when you book your accommodation downtown. But when it comes to exploring the North Shore, a charming creekside cabin or B&B in North Vancouver suits much better. It’s closer to the trails, and it treats you with that exact same serene atmosphere which belongs to this community.

a river is just a shooting sight, isn’t it?

This Riverfront Bed and Breakfast gets lots of praise for its wonderful location (right next to a river just like the name suggests), comfortable beds and delicious breakfast. The Secret Garden Treehouse is tucked in the woods, and it offers ocean views, a spacious outdoor patio and a treehouse. This condo and this large family home in Lynn Valley are almost walking distance from many trails and attractions we’ve mentioned in the post.
