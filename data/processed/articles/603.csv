According to Feldman: ""Yesterday, there was a tragedy in our Ecopark. Two people who managed to get into the park’s territory to feed the animals (it is needed at least once every three days) were killed. They died under mortar and machine gun fire.""

Details: On 7 March, Feldman Ecopark was looking for volunteers who could feed the animals.

""A large number of animals remain in our Ecopark, which is located on the outskirts of the city and has been severely damaged by shelling. Only some of the animals were evacuated or temporarily placed in people’s homes.

Many employees of the Ecopark have left [the city] or cannot reach the park. The remaining staff are making a heroic effort to feed and care for all the animals, but their efforts are no longer enough. Therefore, we need volunteers who can get to the Ecopark and spend 1-2 hours there feeding the animals,"" the statement said.",https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2022/03/8/7329504/

On February 24, Russian president Vladimir Putin announced the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine. Russian troops simultaneously crossed Ukrainian borders from the north, east, and Crimea. They are destroying cities, killing civilians, shelling and destroying key infrastructure facilities, hitting Ukrainians' homes with missiles. Martial law was imposed in Ukraine and general mobilization was announced. The Armed Forces of Ukraine, with the support of all the people, courageously resist the aggression.

A hospital in the Ukrainian city of Izium was destroyed by the Russian military, according to the city’s Deputy Mayor, Volodymyr Matsokin. On Tuesday, Matsokin uploaded several photos and a video to Facebook showing the ruins of the city’s central hospital.

“It was probably another secret NATO base,” Matsokin sarcastically noted the social media post.

The city’s police station was also reportedly destroyed.

Izium, a city of approximately 46,000 located 75 miles southeast of Kharkiv, was reportedly attacked by Russian aircraft on the night of March 3rd, killing eight. Battles in the area have raged for the last several days. On Tuesday, the head of the President's Office of Ukraine, Oleksiy Arestovych, denied reports that the city had fallen to the Russian military.

""The report that the enemy allegedly captured the city of Izium does not correspond to reality. There are fights going on right now. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are defeating the enemy,"" Arestovych said at a briefing, as quoted by Interfax-Ukraine.

The United Nations human rights office said Tuesday that it is waiting to verify the number of civilian casualties in the city. ""This concerns, for example, the towns of Volnovakha, Mariupol, Izium where there are allegations of hundreds of civilian casualties,"" the human rights office noted in a statement.
