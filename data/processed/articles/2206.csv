The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

How you can help: Here are ways those in the U.S. can help support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.

2,b3f01204-b0aa-409c-b7aa-2ae2aa6dd597,[],2022-02-24 00:00:00,"Putin approves ‘special military operation’ as Russia launches an invasion of Ukraine by land, air and sea.

Russia has launched an all-out invasion of Ukraine by land, air and sea, the biggest attack by one state against another in Europe since World War II and confirmation of the worst fears of the West.

The attacks began on Thursday after Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a televised address that he had approved a “special military operation”. The move came after Moscow earlier recognised rebel-held territories in Luhansk and Donetsk and said they had asked for its “help”.

Russian missiles rained down on Ukrainian cities. Ukraine reported columns of troops pouring across its borders into the eastern Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Luhansk regions, and landing by sea at the cities of Odesa and Mariupol in the south.

Russian troops attacked Ukraine from Belarus as well as Russia with Belarusian support, and an attack was also being launched from annexed Crimea, Ukraine’s border guard service said.

Explosions could be heard before dawn in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Gunfire rattled out near the main airport and sirens blared across the city.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said martial law had been declared and he appealed to world leaders to impose all possible sanctions on Russia, including on Putin, who he said wanted to destroy the Ukrainian state.

Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter that Putin had “launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine”.

“Peaceful Ukrainian cities are under strikes. This is a war of aggression. Ukraine will defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now,” he said.

Putin justified the attack as “a special military operation” to protect people, including Russian citizens who had been subjected to “genocide” in Ukraine, an accusation the West has long described as absurd propaganda.

“And for this, we will strive for the demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine,” Putin said. “Russia cannot feel safe, develop, and exist with a constant threat emanating from the territory of modern Ukraine.”

Russia’s defence ministry said it had taken out military infrastructure at Ukrainian airbases and degraded its air defences.

Ukraine closed its airspace to civilian flights citing a high risk to safety, while Russia suspended domestic flights at airports near its border with Ukraine until March 2.

Russian-backed separatists in the east said they had captured two towns, the RIA news agency reported.

Shortly after Putin spoke, Al Jazeera’s Andrew Simmons, who is in Kyiv, said there were explosions in the capital and power had been cut.

It appeared to be a “full-scale attack”, targeting the airport and key buildings, he said. There was “chaos” in the city centre, he added.

US President Joe Biden, in a phone call with Zelenskyy, condemned the “unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces”, the White House said.

Biden said in a statement he briefed Zelenskyy on Washington and its allies’ planned next steps against Russia, including “severe sanctions”.

In an impassioned appeal, United Nations chief Antonio Guterres condemned Russia’s actions.

“In the name of humanity, bring your troops back to Russia,” he said. “In the name of humanity, do not allow a war to start in Europe which could be the worst war since the beginning of the century with consequences not only devastating for Ukraine, not only tragic for the Russian Federation but with an impact we cannot even foresee.”

NATO called an emergency meeting with chief Jens Stoltenberg condemning what he said was a “reckless attack”.

The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said Russia faces “unprecedented isolation” over its attack on Ukraine and will be hit with the “harshest sanctions” the EU has ever imposed.

‘You declared war’

Putin’s address ordering the military action took place at the same time as the UN Security Council met for its second emergency meeting this week.

Russia’s UN ambassador Vasily Nebenzya, who is the current president of the Security Council, admitted to fellow members of the council that “special operations” were under way, insisting to the other ambassadors that the action did not amount to war and was a consequence of Ukraine’s actions.

“The aim of the operation is to protect the people who for eight years have been suffering “genocide of the Ukrainian regime”, he said, claiming the action was justified under Article 51 of the UN Charter, which allows for individual or collective self-defence in the face of an armed attack on a UN member state.

Putin demanded Ukrainian forces lay down their arms, and repeated his position that any Ukrainian membership of NATO was unacceptable to Moscow, according to state media.

In the UN council chamber, Ukraine’s UN Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya appeared lost for words. “Three minutes ago, your president declared war on my country,” he told his Russian counterpart Nebenzya.

In a second round of comments, having effectively called for Russia’s expulsion from the UN, he concluded: “There’s no purgatory for war criminals, Mr Ambassador, they go to hell.”

The world must act immediately. Future of Europe & the world is at stake. To do list: 1. Devastating sanctions on Russia NOW, including SWIFT

2. Fully isolate Russia by all means, in all formats

The US said it was calling for an urgent resolution at the Security Council, and the call was backed by the United Kingdom, France and Ireland who noted Russia’s utter “disdain” for the UN by its military assault. The meeting is expected within 24 hours.

As news of the assault on Ukraine filtered through, some diplomats condemned Russia.

Germany said it was a “shameless breach of international law” while the UK said the attack was “unprovoked, unjust” and it was a “dark day for Ukraine”.

Analysts said it could be that Russia was beginning with a “shock and awe” attack in the belief that it might mean it could get what it wants without having to mount a larger-scale attack.

“Putin might think that will cause such shock that the government will collapse, that there will be calls for surrender,” William Courtney, an expert at the Rand Corporation in Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera. “If so, the Kremlin has probably underestimated the resilience of Ukrainians.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/24/putin-orders-military-operations-in-eastern-ukraine-as-un-meets

In his address during which he called the moves a “military operation” to “protect civilians”, Putin warned other countries that any attempt to interfere or help Ukraine would lead to “consequences you have never seen”.

Explosions were heard before dawn in the capital Kyiv, and the cities of Kharkiv and Odesa as world leaders decried the start of an invasion that could cause massive casualties, topple Ukraine’s democratically elected government and threaten the post-Cold War balance on the continent.

According to an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at least 40 people have died and dozens more are injured.

Mr Zelenskyy declared martial law, saying Russia has targeted the country’s military infrastructure. When military bodies and armed forces are granted authority over an area, usually invoked in times of war, natural disaster, or rebellion.

Across the globe, financial markets plunged and oil prices soared, and governments from the US to Asia and Europe readied new sanctions after weeks of failed efforts for a diplomatic solution.

Here’s how the world reacted to what Ukraine’s Foreign Minister called a “full-scale invasion”.

UK

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK will eventually use military action to stop Russia further invading Ukraine if all other options fail, as he described the events as a ""catastrophe"" for Europe.

In an address to the nation, he said: ""Our mission is clear diplomatically, politically, eventually military, this hideous and barbaric venture of Vladimir Putin must end in failure.""

Mr Johnson said Russian President Putin has “chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction” with his attack on Ukraine and that the UK and its allies would respond “decisively”.

The PM's speech comes after he chaired an emergency morning Cobra meeting to address the crisis - it will be followed by a statement in Parliament around 5pm.

Mr Johnson has called an ""urgent meeting"" of all Nato leaders and that he will also speak to leaders of G7 countries Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United States.

In a statement on Twitter, Mr Johnson said he had spoken with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss “next steps”.

A Downing Street spokesperson said Mr Johnson had assured Mr Zelensky the West “would not stand by as President Putin waged his campaign against the Ukrainian people”.

“The Prime Minister said he hoped Ukraine could resist and that Ukraine and its people were in the thoughts of everyone in the United Kingdom during this dark time,” the spokesperson said.

All UK airlines have been instructed to avoid Ukrainian airspace after the Department for Transport announced a ban on flights between the UK and Ukraine.

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace described Russia’s actions as “naked aggression against a democratic country” and said no one had been fooled by the Kremlin’s “false flags and fake narratives”.

“The Russian Federation has today further violated Ukrainian Sovereignty,” he said.

Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the Kremlin “must face the severest consequences” for “unprovoked aggression” in Ukraine.

She tweeted: “Overnight developments in Ukraine – however anticipated – are appalling and horrific.""

Britain’s ambassador to Ukraine urged UK nationals to leave Ukraine immediately.

Melinda Simmons wrote on Twitter: “We advise GB nationals to leave Ukraine immediately if you judge that it is safe to do so from your location. Please call +380 44 490 3660 if you need assistance.”

US

US President Joe Biden called Russia’s decision to commence a military operation an “unprovoked and unjustified attack” as he pledged new economic sanctions.

The president said he planned to address Americans on Thursday after a meeting of the Group of Seven leaders.

He said in a statement: “The prayers of the entire world are with the people of Ukraine tonight as they suffer an unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces.

“President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering. Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable.”

Mr Biden later said his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy had “reached out” to him following the attack by Russian forces and asked for world leaders to “speak out clearly” against Vladimir Putin’s actions.

“I briefed him on the steps we are taking to rally international condemnation, including tonight at the UN Security Council,” Mr Biden wrote on Twitter.

“He asked me to call on the leaders of the world to speak out clearly against President Putin’s flagrant aggression, and to stand with the people of Ukraine.”

He added: “Tomorrow, I will be meeting with the Leaders of the G7, and the United States and our allies and partners will be imposing severe sanctions on Russia.”

UN

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says Russia's attack on Ukraine — as he appealed for President Vladimir Putin to stop his troops — was “the saddest moment” of his five-year tenure.

The UN chief opened the emergency Security Council meeting late on Wednesday by urgently appealing to Putin: “In the name of humanity, bring your troops back to Russia.""

""This is the saddest moment in my tenure as secretary general of the United Nations""

But during that meeting, Putin announced in the early hours of Thursday he was launching a “special military operation” in eastern Ukraine, and explosions could be heard across Ukraine.

Mr Guterres later urged the Russian president to withdraw his troops and added: “In the name of humanity do not allow to start in Europe what could be the worst war since the beginning of the century, with consequences not only devastating for Ukraine, not only tragic for the Russian Federation, but with an impact we cannot even foresee in relation to the consequences for the global economy.”

“What is clear for me is that this war doesn’t make any sense,” Guterres said, stressing that it violates the UN Charter and will cause a level of suffering if it doesn’t stop that Europe hasn’t known since at least the 1990s Balkans crisis.

NATO

NATO's chief said the “brutal act of war” has shattered peace on the European continent, as the US-led alliance mobilised more troops to move toward eastern Europe.

The alliance announced it would be beefing up its ""air, land and sea forces on its eastern flank near Ukraine and Russia"".

Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels: “This is a deliberate, cold-blooded and long-planned invasion... Russia is using force to try to rewrite history.""

He said the Kremlin's actions were a “grave breach of international law” and that allies would meet to address the “renewed aggression”.

“I strongly condemn #Russia’s reckless attack on #Ukraine, which puts at risk countless civilian lives,” he wrote on Twitter.

“This is a grave breach of international law & a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security.

“#NATO Allies will meet to address Russia’s renewed aggression.”

EU The European Union is preparing to impose the “strongest, the harshest package” of sanctions against Russia it has ""ever implemented,"" said EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell.

He described the Kremlin's attack on Ukraine as among ""the darkest hour for Europe since the end of World War II,"" for which Russia will face the consequences of ""unprecedented isolation"".

The 27 EU leaders will be asked to approve a second round of ""massive and targeted sanctions"" later on Thursday at a summit meeting and they could be imposed soon after.

Mr Borrell warned the major nuclear power is threatening reprisals of any other state that comes to Ukraine's rescue - but that the EU and trans-Atlantic partners ""will stand united"" and their strength ""should not be underestimated"".

""This is not only the greatest violation of international law - it's a violation of the basic principles of human co-existence. It's costing many lives, with unknown consequences ahead of us,"" he told a press conference in Brussels on Thursday.

""The European union will respond in the strongest possible terms.""

The bloc had already issued sanctions on Russia for its recognition of breakaway republics in Ukraine earlier this week and the next package will be ""designed to take a heavy toll on the Kremlin’s interests and their ability to finance war,"" said Commission President Ursula von der Leyen as she ""strongly condemned"" the ""unjustified attack"".

“With this package, we will target strategic sectors of the Russian economy by blocking their access to technologies and markets that are key for Russia,"" she told a press conference in Brussels.

“We will weaken Russia’s economic base and its capacity to modernise. In addition, we will freeze Russian assets in the European Union and stop the access of Russian banks to European financial markets.”

Similar to the first package of sanctions, she said the EU's actions will be ""closely aligned"" with those of allies such as the UK, the US, Canada, Japan and Australia.

She continued: ""President Putin is trying to turn the clock back to the times of the Russian empire, but by doing so he is putting at risk the future of the Russian people.

""I call on Russia to immediately stop the violence and withdraw its troops from Ukraine's territory.""

“In these dark hours, our thoughts are with Ukraine and the innocent women, men and children as they face this unprovoked attack and fear for their lives,"" said Ms von der Leyen.

“We will hold the Kremlin accountable.”

The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, has called for a meeting of the council on Thursday evening as he urged Mr Putin to “stop this war immediately”.

Mr Michel said he had spoken with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy as the Belgian condemned Russian’s “unjustified large scale military aggression” as well as expressing his solidarity with Ukraine.

“Today both the European Council and G7 leaders will meet to agree on further steps against Russia’s illegal acts and in support of Ukraine,” he tweeted.

African Union

The African Union's chair urged an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine “to preserve the world from the consequences of planetary conflict”. The statement by Senegal President Macky Sall and AU Commission chair Moussa Faki Mahamat also calls on Russia to respect Ukraine’s territorial integrity and international law, expressing “extreme concern at the very serious and dangerous situation”. Few among Africa’s 54 countries have publicly reacted to the invasion.

Germany

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz sharply condemned Russia’s attack on Ukraine calling it “a terrible day for Ukraine and a dark day for Europe.”

The chancellor said on Thursday morning “the Russian attack on Ukraine is a blatant violation of international law. It cannot be justified by anything.”

Listen to our Ukraine Q&A podcast:

He added that “Germany condemns this reckless act by President Putin in the strongest possible terms.”

Scholz said in a written statement that “our solidarity is with Ukraine and its people. Russia must stop this military action immediately.""

He added Germany would coordinate closely with others within the framework of the G7, NATO and the European Union.

“We woke up in a different world today,” Germany’s foreign minister said.

Australia

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said his country is considering sanctions against 300 members of the Russian parliament over the attack on Ukraine.

Mr Morrison also condemned Russia for the “brutal” and “unprovoked” attack, and said it should withdraw its troops.

Japan

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida condemned Russia’s military actions in the Ukraine and said his country will respond in a speedy fashion in concert with the United States and other allies. “This Russian invasion stands to put at risk the basic principle of international order that forbids one-sided action of force in an attempt to change the status quo. We strongly condemn Russia, and we will respond speedily in cooperation with the US and other Western nations,” he said at his official residence in Tokyo.

China

China is advising its people in Ukraine to stay home because of ongoing military actions and chaos but made no mention of Russian forces.

The notice issued on its Kyiv embassy’s social media account Thursday said: “Social order is chaotic and out of control, especially in the cities where at times of serious unrest.""

It said a person walking on the streets could be a target of attack and traffic could be stopped at any time. It added that people should remain calm and contact local authorities if they come into danger.

China has denounced sanctions against Russia, with which it has increasingly aligned its foreign policy to challenge the West, and blamed the US and its allies for provoking Moscow.

India

India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi phoned Vladimir Putin on Thursday night and appealed for an “immediate cessation of violence,” his office said in a statement.

Modi also expressed concern over Indian citizens in Ukraine. Officials earlier in the day said some 4,000 out of the 20,000 Indian nationals there had been evacuated.",https://www.itv.com/news/2022-02-24/how-has-the-world-reacted-to-russias-military-operation-in-ukraine

After weeks of intense diplomacy, the US, UK and their allies imposed a number of economic sanctions on Russia and said more would follow if it invaded Ukraine. However, the sanctions did not deter Putin who had massed around 200,000 troops along the borders of Ukraine

In a surprise television announcement around 6:00 am in Moscow, Putin said, ""I have made the decision of a military operation"" in Ukraine

Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said “full-scale invasion” of Ukraine was underway and that peaceful Ukrainian cities were under strike.

“From this day, there is a new geopolitical reality in the world,” Gerashchenko said in a statement posted on his official Facebook page.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday announced a military operation in Ukraine, claiming it’s intended to protect civilians

In a televised address, Mr. Putin said the action comes in response to threats coming from Ukraine. He added that Russia doesn’t have a goal to occupy Ukraine. Mr. Putin said the responsibility for the bloodshed lies with the Ukrainian “regime.”

Many countries across the world have reacted strongly to the move, including the U.S., the U.K. The United Nations has made a direct and strong appeal to Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop his troops from attacking Ukraine and “give peace a chance”.

Here are the latest updates:

G7

Group of Seven leaders condemn Russia’s attack on Ukraine.

The German government, which currently heads the G7, put out a joint statement after a virtual leaders’ meeting on Thursday, vowing to bring “forward severe and coordinated economic and financial sanctions.”

It called “on all partners and members of the international community to condemn this attack in the strongest possible terms, to stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine, and raise their voice against this blatant violation of the fundamental principles of international peace and security.”

Romania

Putin threatens peace of whole planet: Romanian President

The President of Romania has condemned Russia’s “reprehensible” attack on Ukraine and said that Russian President Vladimir Putin “threatens the peace of the entire planet.” Romania borders Ukraine and is a member of NATO and the European Union.

Romanian President Klaus Iohannis said that Russia “chose the reprehensible and completely illegal path of massive armed violence against an independent and sovereign state.” Mr. Iohannis said that Romania, a country of about 19.5 million people, is ready to deal with economic and humanitarian consequences that the conflict could generate.

He stressed that Romania will not be drawn into the military conflict in Ukraine and said Romanian authorities will take “absolutely all the necessary measures” to ensure the safety of the country’s citizens.

Nato

No ‘plans’ to send NATO troops to Ukraine: Stoltenberg

NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday that the alliance had no intention to send forces into Ukraine after Russia invaded its pro-Western neighbour.

“We don’t have NATO troops in Ukraine, and we don’t have any plans to send NATO troops into Ukraine,” Mr. Stoltenberg told a media conference after an emergency meeting of the alliance’s ambassadors.

Germany

German army ‘limited’ in Russia response, says commander

Germany’s army can do little to support the response to the Russian invasion, its chief said said Thursday, as the country’s ex-defence minister admitted that Berlin committed a “historical failure” in not bolstering itself militarily.

Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who was defence minister in Angela Merkel’s cabinet said Germany had forgotten lessons from the past that “negotiation always comes first, but we have to be militarily strong enough to make non-negotiation not an option for the other side”.

“I’m so angry at ourselves for our historical failure. After Georgia, Crimea, and Donbas, we have not prepared anything that would have really deterred Mr. Putin,” admitted Mr. Kramp-Karrenbauer, referring to incursions carried out by Russia while Ms. Merkel was in power.

Her outburst on Twitter came as the chief of the German land army, Alfons Mais, wrote on a post on the social network LinkedIn that “the options we can offer to politicians to support (NATO) are extremely limited.”

Germany was criticised in the build-up to the invasion for refusing to deliver lethal weapons into the crisis zone, sending instead 5,000 helmets to Ukraine. The weapons export policy is a long-standing principle, which has its roots in the war of aggression led by the Nazis during World War II. - AFP

Erdogan denounces Russia invasion as ‘heavy blow’ to peace

Oil prices soared on Thursday with Brent surging over the $100 a barrel mark for the first time in eight years as Russia launched an attack on Ukraine, sparking fears that a war in Europe could disrupt energy supplies.

After months of tensions and weeks of reports that Russia is preparing an attack on Ukraine, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin on Thursday launched a military attack on several Ukrainian cities.

In a tweet this morning, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said that Putin had launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Putin has just launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Peaceful Ukrainian cities are under strikes. This is a war of aggression. Ukraine will defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now. — Dmytro Kuleba (@DmytroKuleba) February 24, 2022

He also called for immediate action from foreign governments, including putting “devastating sanctions” on Russia, the provision of weapons for Ukraine, and financial and humanitarian assistance.

The world must act immediately. Future of Europe & the world is at stake. To do list:



1. Devastating sanctions on Russia NOW, including SWIFT

2. Fully isolate Russia by all means, in all formats

3. Weapons, equipment for Ukraine

4. Financial assistance

5. Humanitarian assistance — Dmytro Kuleba (@DmytroKuleba) February 24, 2022

Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, held an urgent meeting this morning with the leadership of the government, representatives of the defence sector, and the economic bloc. The President also spoke about negotiations with world leaders to form an international coalition to end Russian aggression.

Talked to @POTUS, @OlafScholz, @eucopresident, @AndrzejDuda, @BorisJohnson. Urge to stop Putin, war against 🇺🇦 & the world immediately! Building an anti-Putin coalition. Immediate sanctions, defense & financial support to 🇺🇦! Close the airspace! The world must force 🇷🇺 into peace — Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa) February 24, 2022

The escalation of this crisis sparked fears in the market. As a result, according to a report by Reuters, Brent crude rose to as much as $103.78 a barrel, the highest since 14 Aug 2014, and was at $103.18 a barrel at 0830 GMT, up $6.34, or 6.5%. Furthermore, U.S. WTI crude futures jumped $5.48, or 6%, to $97.58 a barrel, after rising to as much as $98.46, the highest since 11 August 2014.

Earlier research from the energy intelligence group, Rystad Energy, estimated that an escalation of military tensions between Russia and Ukraine could put up to 155 billion cubic meters per year of natural gas imports to Europe at risk, if the conflict causes Russia to halt deliveries. The figure corresponds to 30% of Western Europe’s annual gas demand, according to Rystad.

As detailed by Rystad, of the 155 Bcm of piped gas Europe imported from Russia in 2021, 40 Bcm was piped through Ukraine. This supply would likely be disrupted in the event of military escalation between the two countries, Rystad said earlier in February.

The U.S. has already imposed sanctions on Russia’s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline while Germany halted the process of certifying it. Announcing the first tranche of sanctions against Russia, U.S. President Joe Biden said on Wednesday that Nord Stream 2 “will not, as I promised, move forward.”

German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, previously said that the project could not go ahead in these crisis circumstances. What this means is that, without the certification, the Nord Stream 2 cannot begin operating.

Nord Stream 2, worth $11 billion, is designed as two parallel 48-inch lines, some 1,200 kilometres long, each starting southwest of St. Petersburg and ending at the German coast at Greifswald.

Earlier this week, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said that, despite fears that Europe might face a gas crunch following the cancellation of Nord Stream 2, Europe is currently in a better situation than it was at the start of 2021/22 winter.

Kateryna Filippenko, principal analyst, Europe gas research, said: “Overall, the current supply and storage situation means Europe is in a better position both to navigate 2022 without Nord Stream 2 and to prepare for the next winter.”

However, Filippenko expects 2023 to be more challenging as Europe may struggle to refill its storage to a comfortable level through summer 2023 and prepare for winter.

Condemnation of Russia’s attack on Ukraine

U.S. President Joe Biden condemned the “unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces.”

President Zelenskyy reached out to me tonight and we just finished speaking. I condemned this unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces. I briefed him on the steps we are taking to rally international condemnation, including tonight at the UN Security Council. — President Biden (@POTUS) February 24, 2022

After talking to Zelenskyy, Biden said: “I briefed him on the steps we are taking to rally international condemnation, including tonight at the United Nations Security Council. He asked me to call on the leaders of the world to speak out clearly against President Putin’s flagrant aggression, and to stand with the people of Ukraine. Tomorrow, I will be meeting with the Leaders of the G7, and the United States and our Allies and partners will be imposing severe sanctions on Russia. We will continue to provide support and assistance to Ukraine and the Ukrainian people.”

NATO Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg, also condemned the attack on Ukraine, calling it “a grave breach of international law & a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security.”

I strongly condemn #Russia’s reckless attack on #Ukraine, which puts at risk countless civilian lives. This is a grave breach of international law & a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security. #NATO Allies will meet to address Russia’s renewed aggression. https://t.co/FPpyuzmUXD — Jens Stoltenberg (@jensstoltenberg) February 24, 2022

“Once again, despite our repeated warnings and tireless efforts to engage in diplomacy, Russia has chosen the path of aggression against a sovereign and independent country,” the Secretary General said in a statement this morning.

Stoltenberg is expected to brief the media today at around 12:00 (CET) after an extraordinary meeting of the North Atlantic Council on “Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine.” The event will be streamed live on the NATO website.

However, Putin sees the situation differently. In an address on Thursday, he spoke about the “tragic events in Donbass.” Reminding of his previous address made on 21 February 2022, he said: “I spoke about our biggest concerns and worries, and about the fundamental threats which irresponsible Western politicians created for Russia consistently, rudely and unceremoniously from year to year. I am referring to the eastward expansion of NATO, which is moving its military infrastructure ever closer to the Russian border.”

Putin further said in his address: “These past days NATO leadership has been blunt in its statements that they need to accelerate and step up efforts to bring the alliance’s infrastructure closer to Russia’s borders. In other words, they have been toughening their position. We cannot stay idle and passively observe these developments. This would be an absolutely irresponsible thing to do for us.”

Further condemnations of Russia’s actions came in a joint statement on Thursday as President Charles Michel of the European Council and President Ursula von der Leyen of the European Commission condemn “in the strongest possible terms Russia’s unprecedented military aggression against Ukraine.”

“We call on Russia to immediately cease the hostilities, withdraw its military from Ukraine and fully respect Ukraine’s territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence. Such use of force and coercion has no place in the 21st century. The EU stands firmly by Ukraine and its people as they face this unparalleled crisis,” the statement said.

Russia is now facing more sanctions as President Michel has urgently convened an extraordinary meeting of the European Council to discuss the crisis and further restrictive measures. These will impose massive and severe consequences on Russia for its actions. President von der Leyen and High Representative Borrell will outline a further sanctions package being finalised by the European Commission and the EEAS in close coordination with partners.",https://www.offshore-energy.biz/oil-price-soars-past-100-mark-as-russia-ukraine-crisis-escalates/

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled a package of “severe” sanctions against Russia on Thursday, targeting banks, members of President Vladimir Putin’s closest circle and the extremely wealthy who enjoy high-rolling London lifestyles.Western nations are coordinating action to impose tough sanctions against Russia in response to its all-out invasion of neighbouring Ukraine, where Moscow staged missile strikes on cities and poured its troops into the country.Speaking to parliament, PM Johnson said Putin would be condemned by the world and by history for his invasion, never able to cleanse the “blood of Ukraine” from his hands.“This hideous of the barbarous venture of Vladimir Putin must end in failure,” he told parliament when announcing the new sanctions.The government said it would impose an asset freeze on some major Russian banks, including state-owned VTB, its second-biggest bank, and stop major Russian companies from raising finance in Britain.Since the fall of the Soviet Union three decades ago, London’s capital markets have been the favoured destination for Russian companies seeking to raise money outside Moscow.
