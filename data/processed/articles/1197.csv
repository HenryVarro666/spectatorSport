Russian shelling of Europe's largest nuclear power plant on Friday prompted widespread dismay, with world leaders swiftly condemning the assault and the U.N. nuclear chief warning ""we are in completely uncharted waters."" Russian military forces have seized control of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant, according to Ukraine's nuclear agency, following a night of shelling that set a building ablaze at the complex. Authorities say the fire at the site has now been extinguished by emergency services and radiation levels are normal. Two security personnel were injured as a result of the attack. In response, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said: ""Europe needs to wake up."" ""We are issuing a warning, no country has ever shot at nuclear blocks except for Russia,"" Zelenskyy said in a video statement, according to a translation. ""For the first time ever in our history, in the history of humankind, the terrorist country has reverted to nuclear terror.""

Situated in the southeast of Ukraine, the Zaporizhzhya complex houses six of the country's 15 operational nuclear power reactors. These reactors produce about half of the country's electricity.

Reactors not affected

The U.N. nuclear chief said on Friday that it was understood the projectile that hit Zaporizhzhya came from Russian forces. Rafael Mariano Grossi, director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, warned the situation at the complex is ""very fragile"" and ""continues to be extremely tense and challenging."" ""It is important to say that all the safety systems of the six reactors at the plant were not affected and that there has been no release of radioactive material,"" Grossi said.

Both Russia and Ukraine are considering an offer of meeting at Chornobyl, he added: ""It is time for action ... we need to do something about this."" The aim of the proposed meeting was for both sides to recommit to the principles of nuclear safety. The State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine said personnel at the Zaporizhzhia facility were monitoring the condition of power units to ensure they could operate safely. It comes as Russia's invasion of Ukraine enters its ninth day and amid conflicting reports about which side controls the strategically important Black Sea port city of Kherson.

Global condemnation

World leaders condemned Russia's attack on the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the ""reckless actions"" of Russian President Vladimir Putin could ""directly threaten the safety of all of Europe."" U.S. President Joe Biden urged Moscow to stop its military activities around the site, while Canada's Justin Trudeau said the ""horrific attacks"" at the nuclear site were unacceptable and called on Russia to ""cease immediately."" All three heads of government spoke to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy by telephone. The IAEA has put its Incident and Emergency Centre in ""full response mode"" due to the situation at the nuclear site and appealed for a halt of the use of force. The U.N. agency had previously warned Russia's war with Ukraine had raised the risk of nuclear accidents and called for restraint from all actions that could jeopardize the safe operations of Ukraine's nuclear facilities.",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/04/ukraine-nuclear-russian-troops-seize-control-of-zaporizhzhya-plant.html

MUKACHEVO, Ukraine — A top U.S. official said Friday that a Russian assault at a major Ukrainian nuclear facility had nearly caused devastating consequences for the world, even as the mayor of Mariupol warned that the port city was “on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe.” Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight West of Mariupol in Kherson, a regional capital and the first major city to fall to Russian forces, a city council member said Russian equipment and soldiers were “absolutely everywhere” as supplies of food and other necessities begin to dwindle.

And in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, Russian troops have fired cluster munitions into at least three residential neighborhoods, according to a Human Rights Watch report released Friday.

The grim conditions on the ninth day of Russia’s invasion spawned an urgent appeal late Friday from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who urged Europeans to “take to the streets” to back his battered country.

“Do not be silent. Support Ukraine. Because if Ukraine does not survive, the whole of Europe will not survive,” Zelensky said.

As demonstrators in multiple European cities heeded the president’s call, Russia’s international isolation grew.

The country’s Internet censor on Friday announced that it would block access to Facebook, cutting off a key source of outside information to Russian citizens. The BBC said it would suspend reporting from Russia in response to new legislation that it said “appears to criminalize the process of independent journalism.” Major U.S. news networks, including CNN, ABC and CBS, also said they would stop reporting from Russia.

International companies such as Airbnb, Microsoft and Cogent Communications — a key Internet provider — also cut ties.

Pressure on Moscow could escalate further in the coming days, with the Biden administration weighing a ban on crude oil imports. The United Nations’ top human rights body, meanwhile, voted decisively to set up a commission to investigate alleged rights violations by Russia, amid growing reports of potential war crimes.

But the limits to international willingness to come to Ukraine’s defense were also laid freshly bare, with NATO’s senior leader once again rebuffing Ukrainian demands to set up a no-fly zone.

The exact number of casualties caused by more than a week of fighting has been impossible to verify. The U.N. human rights office said Friday that at least 331 civilians had been killed, while Ukraine’s emergency services put the number of civilian fatalities much higher, at more than 2,000.

A U.N. statement said most of the casualties had been caused “by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and missile and airstrikes.”

Russia has acknowledged the deaths of about 500 of its troops, while Ukrainian officials claim that as many as 10,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or captured.

Russia’s seizure early Friday of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power facility, Europe’s largest nuclear plant, came after a projectile set part of the complex on fire, raising fears across Europe of a catastrophic accident.

The U.N. nuclear watchdog reported that the blaze had not affected “essential” equipment and that Ukraine’s regulator reported no change in surrounding radiation levels. U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm tweeted that the Energy Department also had seen no elevated radiation readings.

“The plant’s reactors are protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down,” Granholm wrote. Even so, the blaze sparked international alarm and underscored the perils of a war fought around nuclear sites.

The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said the world “narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe” and thanked Ukrainian operators for keeping nuclear reactors safe.

“Russia’s attack last night put Europe’s largest nuclear power [plant] at grave risk,” she said. “It was incredibly reckless and dangerous.”

Zelensky said his country had “survived a night that could have stopped history” and that the attack on the nuclear facility could have been as bad as “six Chernobyls.”

Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations denied reports that the Russian military shelled the reactor, saying his country’s troops were actually offering “protection” for the facility — a claim that Western ambassadors dismissed.

In Mariupol, Russian forces have been engaged in a “bombardment of critical civilian infrastructure” aimed at forcing the city to surrender, a senior western intelligence official said.

The city’s mayor, Vadym Boychenko, said officials were hoping that talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials would establish a “period of silence” to restore utilities such as electricity and water. “We are simply being destroyed,” he said on his Telegram channel, noting the city has been under “merciless bombardment” from Russian forces over the past five days.

Kherson, meanwhile, faces dire consequences if a humanitarian corridor is not opened soon to allow civilians to be evacuated, and for food and medicine to be delivered, the secretary of the city council said.

“In Kherson, we are running out of food — literally, we can still last for maybe three, four days,” the city council secretary, Galina Luhova, said by telephone. “We’re running out of medicines, we’re out of baby food, we are running out of diapers, and we are running out of first aid in hospitals.”

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz spoke Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling on him to “immediately cease all hostilities” and allow access for humanitarian aid to Ukraine, according to a readout of the conversation from Berlin.

With the conflict now in its second week and Russia sending nearly all of its assembled military power into neighboring Ukraine, satellite images are providing glimpses of the scale of the invading force, as well as the devastation the fighting has wrought. Analysis of satellite imagery by the U.S. firm Maxar Technologies shows bridges and roads damaged and homes destroyed in towns and cities across the country.

In Chernihiv, a strategic northern city on a highway that links the Ukraine-Belarus border with Kyiv, the capital, and where a fierce battle has been waged in recent days, the images show damaged roads, bridges and homes. Some factories appear to have been leveled. On Friday, Chernihiv’s regional authority said in a Facebook post that Russian strikes killed 47 people, including nine women.

The images also continue to show a long Russian armored column north of Kyiv that has remained stalled because of what Western officials say are logistical challenges and fierce resistance by Ukrainian forces, including the destruction of a bridge.

“We certainly believe that the Ukrainians blowing up that bridge absolutely had an effect on stopping and curtailing the movement of that convoy,” a senior U.S. defense official said. “But we also believe that they have hit the convoy at other places as well in direct attacks.”

The convoy may also have stalled because Russians have not been able to seize the suburbs west of Kyiv, where antitank weapons have littered roads with destroyed vehicles and dead Russian troops. A significant blow to the Russian forces in the area are losses among its airborne soldiers, said Rob Lee, a Russia military expert and a senior fellow with the Foreign Policy Research Institute. Airborne troops are expected to move quickly against the enemy, but their lightly armored vehicles have become a burden as the troops have struggled to gain the initiative.

The convoy, consisting of combat and logistics vehicles, appears destined to help encircle Kyiv. But if the defenders can hold, Lee said, “they will stymie forces trying to begin the siege.”

Alarm over the fate of Ukraine’s cities has intensified amid growing evidence that Russian forces are indiscriminately targeting urban centers.

“We have seen the use of cluster bombs and we have seen reports of use of other types of weapons which would be in violation of international law,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels on Friday.

In its report Friday, Human Rights Watch said it had documented the use of cluster munitions on the basis of two witness interviews and the analysis of 40 videos and images. Some of these sources show the “explosion signatures and rocket remnants” consistent with the delivery of cluster munitions from 9M55K Smerch rockets, the group added.

Because of the indiscriminate nature of cluster munitions — they scatter over a wide area small bomblets that could explode even after the fighting has ended — Human Rights Watch claimed that Russia may have committed a war crime by using them.

“Using cluster munitions in populated areas shows a brazen and callous disregard for people’s lives,” said Steve Goose, the arms director at Human Rights Watch. “If these deadly acts were carried out either intentionally or recklessly, they would be war crimes.”

The United States, which is out of step with many of its allies in abstaining from a treaty banning cluster weapons, has said for days it cannot verify they are being used by Russians in Ukraine.

Russian forces have launched more than 500 missiles of all sizes since the invasion began, the Pentagon said Friday, many of which were fired from inside the territory of Russia and Belarus.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in Brussels as part of a trip to Europe this week, said conditions for Ukrainian civilians will only deteriorate in the days to come. “The terrible expectation is that the suffering we’ve already seen is likely to get worse before it gets better,” Blinken said.

No release of radioactive material, monitoring working

VIENNA, March 4 (Reuters) - No damage was done to reactors at Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and there was no release of radioactive material after a military projectile hit a nearby building on the site, U.N. atomic chief Rafael Grossi said on Friday.

Two members of security staff were injured when the projectile hit overnight after the Ukrainian authorities reported a battle with Russian troops near Europe's biggest power plant, which is operating at just a small fraction of its capacity with one of its six units still running. read more

At a news conference called at short notice, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Grossi showed an overhead shot of the site and the building that was hit, a training centre close to but separate from the row of reactor units.

""What we understand is that this projectile is a projectile that is coming from the Russian forces. We do not have details about the kind of projectile,"" Grossi said, adding that the radiation monitoring system at the site was functioning normally.

""We of course are fortunate that there was no release of radiation and that the integrity of the reactors in themselves was not compromised,"" he added.

Russia's Defence Ministry on Friday blamed the attack on Ukrainian ""saboteurs"". Reuters could not independently verify what happened in the incident. read more

Russia's invasion of Ukraine is the first time war has broken out in a country with such an advanced and established nuclear power programme, the IAEA says. Zaporizhzhia is the biggest of the country's four operational nuclear power plants, together providing about half Ukraine's electricity.

Grossi suggested meeting Russian and Ukrainian officials at defunct power plant Chernobyl, where Russia has seized the radioactive waste facilities near the site of the world's worst nuclear accident in 1986, so that they could commit not to do anything to endanger nuclear security in Ukraine.

'NOT NORMAL'

Staff on duty at Chernobyl have not been rotated out since it was seized last week despite repeated appeals by Grossi. The situation at Zaporizhzhia was similar in that Russia controls it but Ukrainian staff continue to operate it.

""For the time being it is purely Ukrainian staff running the operations there. What we have in this case as we speak ... is in Chernobyl and in Zaporizhzhia we have effective control of the site in the hands of Russian military forces. I hope the distinction is clear,"" Grossi said.

Russia and Ukraine were considering his offer of a meeting at Chernobyl. Grossi appealed overnight on both sides not to clash near Zaporizhzhia.

""I'm extremely concerned. This is something which is very, very fragile, very unstable as a situation,"" he said on Friday.

""Right now we have this normal abnormality, if I can put it like that. The other day in my statement (to the IAEA Board of Governors) I was saying normal operations (at Zaporizhzhia) but in fact there is nothing normal about this.""

The fire was extinguished and there was no release of radioactive material, but IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said he was “extremely concerned” about the situation at the Zaporizhzhia plant, which is located at the town of Enerhodar on the Dnieper River in southern Ukraine, north of Crimea on a major invasion route by Russian forces. Experts said the incident underscores ongoing concerns about fighting occurring near Ukraine’s reactors.

“Firing shells in the area of a nuclear power plant violates the fundamental principle that the physical integrity of nuclear facilities must be maintained and kept safe at all time,” Grossi said.

The radiation systems at the plant are fully functional, but it is not currently possible for monitors to fully access the site to ensure systems are operating safely, IAEA said. Two people were reported injured, the organization said, citing Ukrainian officials. Only one of the plant’s reactors is currently operating and the plant’s staff remain on site, officials said.

The U.S. Embassy in Ukraine said on its Twitter account that attacking a nuclear power plant is a “war crime.”

“Putin’s shelling of Europe’s largest nuclear plant takes his reign of terror one step further,” the post said.

Zaporizhzhia is Europe’s largest nuclear plant, with six reactors. Yesterday, a Twitter message from Ukraine Foreign Affairs Minister Dmytro Kuleba said, “Russian army is firing from all sides” at the plant. “Fire has already broke out,“ the minister said. Kuleba pleaded with Russians to cease fire and allow firefighters in to quell the flames and create a security zone.

In a statement last night, the White House said that President Biden spoke by telephone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about the threat to the plant and would be briefed regularly.

Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said Russian military operations near the plant “are reckless and must cease.” After speaking with Ukraine’s energy minister, Granholm commented on Twitter, “the plant’s reactors are protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down.”

Granholm also said the Energy Department had activated its nuclear incident response team to monitor the situation with the Department of Defense, Nuclear Regulatory Commission and White House, and said the administration had seen “no elevated radiation readings near the facility.” IAEA said it was putting its incident and emergency center in full response mode.

Containment structures around U.S. reactors were designed to withstand aircraft impacts, but pumps, backup generators and their fuel supplies, and other equipment that could be vital in emergencies are much more exposed, noted Matthew Bunn, a professor for energy, national security and foreign policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, in a Twitter comment last night.

In one of the first accounts of the fighting, Andriy Tuz, spokesperson for the plant, said in a video statement that “we demand that they stop the heavy weapons fire. There is a real threat of nuclear danger in the biggest atomic energy station in Europe.” The plant supplies about a quarter of the nation’s electricity.

Grossi issued a statement yesterday calling the threat “critical.” Ukraine officials informed IAEA that a large number of Russian tanks and infantry broke through Ukrainian defenses to attack Enerhodar.

The website of the Ukrainian nuclear regulatory organization issued an appeal to IAEA to “take concrete joint action” in the emergency.

Earlier this week, international nuclear monitors said that the invasion posed a safety threat to 15 reactors in Ukraine, which is Europe’s second-largest nuclear power producer after France. Experts warned of risks such as stray missiles or power outages caused by the invasion that could affect the ability of reactors to cool (Energywire, Feb. 29).

James Acton, director of the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said in a Twitter post yesterday while the immediate danger to the Zaporizhzhya plant appears to have passed, the events “underscore the dangers facing all of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants. “

“While Russia should get out of Ukraine entirely, it must keep all military operations well away from Ukraine’s power plants and avoid attacks, such on Ukraine’s power grid, that could endanger them,” he said.

On the night of March 3, more than 4 million people watched a livestream of security camera footage from the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. Located along the southern bank of the Dnieper River, the six reactors at Zaporizhzhia constitute the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Bright flashes illuminated columns of armored vehicles, which were otherwise muted against the grayscale footage.

Before the invasion, Ukraine derived nearly half its electrical power from nuclear power plants, and of that, nearly half the capacity comes from Zaporizhzhia. With the reactor held by Russian forces and cities like Mariupol under siege from Russian forces, Zaporizhzhia’s capture stands as both a first in the history of warfare, and as part of a much longer pattern: the denial of electrical power to countries under invasion.

This story also appeared in Popular Science

During the attack, a projectile hit a training building on the power plant campus, setting it on fire. The reactors remained unharmed and the fire was later extinguished. By the morning of March 4, the site was reportedly under Russian control, with a Ukrainian authority claiming the management of the facility was operating under gunpoint.

In the early hours of March 4, the plant “became the first operating civil nuclear power plant to come under armed attack,” the World Nuclear Association declared in a statement, going on to note that “The Additional Protocol of 1979 to the Geneva Conventions contains in Article 56 a provision stating that nuclear power plants ‘shall not be made the object of attack, even where these objects are military objectives, if such an attack may cause the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population.’”

When it fell, Zaporizhzhia became the second nuclear power plant captured by Russia since the invasion began. A week earlier, on Feb. 24, Russian forces had captured Chernobyl (“Chornobyl,” in Ukrainian), the long since decommissioned site of the infamous nuclear reactor disaster. Chernobyl last produced electricity in the year 2000, but the site is still staffed to manage the work of decommissioning, like sustaining cooling pools for spent fuel rods.

“Regarding reports earlier today of higher radiation measurements at the Chornobyl site,” the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a February 25 release, “Ukraine’s regulatory authority said that they may have been caused by heavy military vehicles stirring up soil still contaminated from the 1986 accident.”

The same geographic concerns that situated Chernobyl along the Pripyat River north of Kyiv also suggests why so many tanks and military vehicles had driven by: It’s a relatively cleared, dry area along a highway north of the capital, a traversable break from the surrounding marshlands. Kyiv remains a pivotal objective of Russian forces in the war, and the road through Chernobyl is one of the most direct paths for forces aiming to encircle the city.

Even decommissioned, important work continues at Chernobyl, like the safe monitoring of cooling pools for spent fuel. A loss of power to the site, reported by Ukraine’s minister of foreign affairs Dmytro Kuleba, could threaten its operation, though the cooling pools should maintain an effective temperature for weeks or months, depending on the estimate. The IAEA noted that the lack of power is also a strain on the staff and guards working in captivity at the facility.

But Zaporizhzhia, a live reactor complex located between Russia’s Crimean holdings and its advancing forces from the declared Donetsk and Luhansk republics, presents a much more striking security challenge than the inactive Chernobyl. Managing the safety of a nuclear power plant requires technical skill and the ability to properly and thoroughly follow safety procedures. Doing so under hostile military occupation, while that same military is responsible for attacks on the country, might make such safety procedures impossible, and difficult to verify.

“According to reports, the situation at occupied power plants is bad and getting worse. Plant managers need to get approval for any actions, including those related to reactor operations,” writes Nickolas Roth of the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a U.S.-based nonprofit aimed at reducing nuclear and biological threats. “Ukraine’s nuclear regulator has said it is now having problems communicating with staff at Zaporizhzhya as phone lines, emails, and fax machines are no longer operating.”

Only one of the reactors at Zaporizhzhia was operational at the time of the attack, thanks to regular maintenance outages, controlled shutdowns, and reserve operation. Reactors are designed to withstand many kinds of powerful impacts, like storms and even airliner crashes, so it remains unlikely that an errant shell from a battle would be catastrophic.

Instead, a deeper concern from the hostile occupation of Zaporizhzhia is that merely being held in Russian hands will lead to denying electricity to civilians in the country. Invading militaries have destroyed or captured power plants before, but never one like this. It’s a grim signal, as Russia’s invasion moves from first forays to grinding sieges.

Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), confirmed that a fire at Europe’s largest nuclear power station was the result of a Russian airstrike.

He said at a press conference this morning that the situation remains “fragile” and “unstable”, but that the attack did not result in a radiation leak. Russian forces have seized control of the plant.

The overnight fire at the facility sparked concerns of a repeat of the 1986 nuclear meltdown in Chernobyl, regarded as the worst nuclear catastrophe in history.

Three soldiers were killed in last night’s assault and a further two wounded, according to Ukraine’s nuclear agency.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described the missile attack as an act of “nuclear terrorism” and warned that last night “could have been the end of history for Ukraine and Europe.”

It comes as Putin warned Russia’s neighbours not to “escalate the situation” by imposing more restrictions on his country.

He told a government meeting broadcast: “There are no bad intentions towards our neighbourt. I would also advise them not to escalate the situation, not to introduce any restrictions.”

The blaze has now been extinguished, though Russian troops have seized the nuclear power plant and remain in control of the site.

Mr Grossi said five of the plant’s reactors are offline with the remaining reactor operating at 60 per cent capacity.

He insisted that safety systems were “not affected at all” in the attack, which hit an “adjacent” building, but admitted that “the physical integrity of the building has been compromised with what happened last night”.

Mr Grossi said he had informed Russia that he wants to visit the Chernobyl site in northern Ukraine as soon as possible to ensure the Kremlin is not planning any future attacks on nuclear power plants. Russian troops seized the plant last week.

International condemnation

World leaders rallied to condemn Russia’s overnight attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, warning that it marked a significant escalation in Russia’s ambitions over Ukraine.

In an urgent address on Twitter, President Zelensky said: “Europeans, please wake up. Tell your politicians [that] Russian troops are shooting at a nuclear power plant in Ukraine.

“Russian propaganda has warned in the past that it would cover the world in nuclear ash. Now this isn’t just a warning, this is real.”

Boris Johnson described the incident as a reckless attack that showed that Russian President Vladimir Putin “could now directly threaten the safety of all of Europe”.

The Prime Minister held an emergency call with President Zelensky following the blaze, in which both agreed that Russia “must immediately cease its attack on the power station and allow unfettered access for emergency services ”.

Mr Johnson also called for a meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss an international response to the crisis.

Escalating crisis

Russia has continued to use increasing violence in recent days as part of attempts to seize key cities across Ukraine.

A British intelligence update released this morning said the southern port of Mariupol remains under the control of Ukrainian forces but is currently encircled by Russian troops.

The city, which has a population of more than 400,000 has been without heating, water and electricity for several days after intense shelling by Russian forces.

Pyotr Andriushchenko, an adviser to the Mayor of Mariupol, said the city was facing a humanitarian catastrophe with Kremlin forces blocking all exits and entrances and preventing civilians from fleeing.

The region is considered a key target for Russian forces as it stands between Crimea, which was annexed by Putin in 2014, and the pro-Russian separatist regions in eastern Ukraine.

At least 47 people were killed in an attack on Chernihiv yesterday following heavy missile bombardments on residential areas. The city, located just north of Kyiv, has a population of around 285,000.",https://inews.co.uk/news/nuclear-plant-fire-shelled-russian-forces-ukraine-war-1497612

Countries around the world swiftly condemned the episode, with the United States embassy in Ukraine warning an attack on a nuclear plant was a ""war crime"" and the United Nations Security Council convening an emergency meeting.

In a statement Friday morning local time, the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate (SNRI) confirmed the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine was occupied by Russian military forces, but said officials remained in contact with plant management.

The power plant's six reactors remained intact, though the compartment auxiliary buildings for reactor unit 1 had been damaged, the SNRI said in its statement. Four of the remaining units were being cooled down while one unit is providing power, the statement said.

Petro Kotin, head of Ukraine's nuclear power operator Energoatom, later reported that management were operating at ""gunpoint."" He said on Telegram that Russian forces ""entered the territory of the nuclear power plant, took control of the personnel and management of the nuclear power plant.""

""Today there is no connection, the station management works at invaders' gunpoint,"" Kotin continued.

""As for the staff, they were admitted in the morning to perform their duties. We do not currently have a direct connection to the station. We get information from the sources at the station.""

Kotin warned that although the reactors are safe, further attacks could lead to ""disaster.""

Ukraine's State Emergency Services (SES) had earlier confirmed several dozen firefighters had extinguished a blaze that had started in a training building outside the main reactor complex, following shelling from Russian military forces.

Reports of the fire raised concern from world leaders and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) -- who called for a stop to fighting around the facility -- though the IAEA said Ukrainian authorities had reported background radiation levels were normal and the fire had not affected ""essential"" equipment.

However the ongoing military operation around the site meant the situation was ""very fragile,"" IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi warned.

Speaking at a press conference in Vienna on Friday, the IAEA's Rossi said the safety of the reactors had not been affected.

""We are fortunate there has not been a release of radioactive material and the integrity of the reactors has not been compromised,"" he said. However, the operator and regulator have relayed to the IAEA that the situation on the ground is ""extremely tense and challenging,"" he warned.

He explained that a Russian projectile had hit a building within the site, causing a localized fire, but none of the reactors were affected and radiation monitoring systems are fully functional.

Ukrainian staff are still at the helm of operations at the plant, but ""effective control"" of the site was in the hands of Russian forces, Grossi said, adding: ""I hope the distinction is clear."" He said that what happens next at Zaporizhzhia is ""a situation that is very difficult to sustain, very fragile"" while there is an active military operation and Russian forces in control. ""This is unprecedented,"" he said. ""Completely uncharted waters.""

Grossi later told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that although radioactive material was not released, it was a ""close call.""

He told Amanpour that he had warned both sides that ""the utmost restraint is to be exercised in and around this type of facility. Because wittingly or unwittingly, you can very quickly go into a disaster, and this is why we're so concerned.""

The US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told the meeting that the world ""narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe last night.""

She called Russia's reactions ""reckless"" and ""dangerous,"" saying it put Europe's largest nuclear power plant at grave risk and threatened the safety of civilians in Russia, in the UK and across the European continent. Russian forces were also 20 miles away from Ukraine's second largest nuclear facility, she noted.

""Nuclear facilities cannot become part of this conflict,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. ""Mr Putin must stop this madness, and he must stop it now.""

Zelensky pushes for no-fly zone

On Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russian troops of committing a ""terror attack"" by intentionally firing at the power plant -- potentially risking the lives of millions.

He later condemned NATO's decision to rule out the implementation of a no-fly zone over the country.

NATO's chief said Friday that a no-fly zone over Ukraine is not an option being considered by the alliance. ""We've agreed that we should not have NATO planes operating over Ukrainian airspace or NATO troops on Ukrainian territory,"" Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said at a press conference earlier in Brussels.

In a Facebook post, Zelensky questioned what the alliance's members were thinking, saying, ""All the people who will die from this day will also die because of you, because of your weakness, because of your disunity."" However, he also expressed his gratitude to NATO countries that have shown support for Ukraine.

Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the establishment of a no-fly zone in Ukraine by the US and it's NATO allies could lead to a ""full-fledged war in Europe,"" but said Washington would continue to work with it's allies to provide Ukrainians with the means to defend themselves from Russian aggression.

Nuclear plant under attack

Reports of the attack on the facility emerged early Friday morning, with video of the scene showing bursts of gunfire apparently directed at the Zaporizhzhia facility before dawn.

Flames could also be seen on video footage, though for some time it was unclear where the fire was or the scale of the threat posed to the facility.

Ukrainian authorities released video later on Friday from inside the facility's control room, with an announcement ringing out on a PA system aimed at the Russian forces outside.

""Stop shooting at a nuclear dangerous facility. Stop shooting immediately! You threaten the security of the whole world!"" the announcement says.

The Russian government has claimed Ukrainian ""provocation"" led to a firefight around the nuclear power plant.

In a video briefing, Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russian forces took the city of Enerhodar, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and the territory adjacent to it on February 28. Konashenkov claimed the plant's technical staff continued regular work on the facilities, but that Ukrainian forces attempted a ""monstrous provocation"" in the early hours of Friday. Konashenkov also claimed the Ukrainians had set fire to the training building themselves.

Smoke rises from tire barricades set on fire in Enerhoda, Ukraine, on March 3.

CNN could not immediately verify any details of the firefight on the territory of the plant.

The Russian government has routinely and without evidence claimed the Ukrainian government is staging ""provocations"" to provoke a military response by Western governments.

It's the not first nuclear plant to come under threat from the Russian invasion. On the first day of the assault, Russian forces seized control of the Chernobyl power plant in northern Ukraine, the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster, according to Ukrainian officials.

The Chernobyl nuclear power plant reactor exploded in 1986, when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union -- sparking a disaster that affected, directly or indirectly, nine million people, due to radioactive materials released into the atmosphere.

The IAEA said in a statement that Ukraine had informed it staff held at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant since Russian military forces took control of the site a week ago were facing ""psychological pressure and moral exhaustion.""",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/03/europe/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-fire-ukraine-intl-hnk/index.html

Ukrainian officials said on Friday that fire at the largest nuclear power plant in Europe has been extinguished, but that the facility is now under Russian control after fighting.

In a later development at a Friday news conference, the chief of the U.N.'s atomic watchdog said there had been no release of radioactive material at the plant.

Rafael Mariano Grossi, director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said a Russian projectile had hit a structure at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in southeast Ukraine that was not part of the reactor, injuring two people. He said his organization has been in contact with Ukraine's nuclear regulator and managers at the plant after the strike.

""We are fortunate that there was no release of radiation and that the integrity of the reactors themselves was not compromised,"" he said.

Earlier Friday, Mayor Dmytro Orlov of Enerhodar, the town closest to the Zaporizhzhia plant, posted a message on his Telegram account saying the flames had been extinguished. Ukraine's nuclear regulator issued a statement confirming that the fire was out.

The Ukrainian state company that runs the plant posted a message Friday on Telegram saying that the plant is now under Russian control. ""Russian forces are controlling the administrative building and passage into the plant,"" it says. ""Our employees are still inside, ensuring the stable operation of nuclear facilities. Radiation levels are normal,"" it said.

The company said there were deaths among the casualties but did not elaborate, saying its website has come under cyberattack.

The complex came under Russian shelling on Thursday — prompting alarm about any possible radioactive damage and global calls for Russia to halt its attack.

In an emotional middle-of-the-night speech, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the fire could mean ""the end for everyone. The end for Europe. The evacuation of Europe."" He also had a late night phone call with President Biden.

The Zaporizhzhia plant provides a quarter of Ukraine's electricity. The war has already strained Ukraine's critical infrastructure, leading to blackouts across the country.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson criticized the Russian attack and said he would seek an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council, The Associated Press reported. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the attacks ""horrific,"" saying they ""must stop immediately."" Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda called the Russian action an ""act of nuclear terrorism.""

In a rare publicly stated expression of unease about the war in Ukraine, China said it is ""seriously concerned about the safety and security"" of nuclear facilities in Ukraine following the attack.

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told reporters on Friday that China will continue to follow developments at the Zaporizhzhia plant in the city of Enerhodar and ""calls on all parties concerned to maintain calm and restraint, prevent further escalation of the situation and ensure the safety of the nuclear facilities concerned,"" according to The Associated Press.

During the attack, security footage from the plant's main gate, geolocated by NPR, had showed what appeared to be Russian troops at the entrance of the power plant, engaged in active combat on the site. Footage also showed what appeared to be a fire in one of the plant's administrative buildings.

In a brief statement on Thursday, the International Atomic Energy Agency said that it had received a report from Ukraine's atomic regulatory authority stating that Russian armor and infantry had broken through a barricade in a nearby town earlier in the day.

""The battle is going on in the town of Enerhodar and on the road to the ZNPP [Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant] site,"" the regulator told the IAEA, adding that the situation was ""critical.""

Biden spoke with Zelenskyy about the attack and joined him in urging Russia to cease its military activities in the area and allow firefighters and emergency responders to access the site.

U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said on Twitter that she spoke with her Ukrainian counterpart and that the plant's reactors were being safely shut down. She also said, ""We have seen no elevated radiation readings near the facility.""

The IAEA said that the fire had not affected essential equipment and that Ukraine's nuclear regulator reported no change in radiation levels, according to the AP. The American Nuclear Society concurred, saying that the latest radiation levels remained within natural background levels.

The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant is the largest nuclear plant in Europe. It is located in southeastern Ukraine. It consists of six Russian-designed VVER pressurized water reactors that date from the 1980s and 1990s. Ukraine relies on 15 nuclear reactors spread throughout the country for around half of its electricity.

Ukraine was the site of the world's largest nuclear disaster, the 1986 explosion of a reactor at the Chernobyl plant. Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister, warned that if something similar happens at Zaporizhzhia, ""it will be 10 times larger.""

10,c999d0cd-0c62-4be0-8228-1afe825a32c7,"['Jim Heintz', 'Yuras Karmanau', 'Mstyslav Chernov', 'Associated Press']",,"KYIV, Ukraine — No radiation was released from a Russian attack at Europe's biggest nuclear power plant in Ukraine and firefighters have extinguished a blaze at the facility, U.N. and Ukrainian officials said Friday, as Russian forces pressed their campaign to cripple the country despite global condemnation.

The International Atomic Energy Agency’s director-general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said Friday the building hit by a Russian “projectile” at the Zaporizhzhia plant was “not part of the reactor” but instead a training center at the plant.

Nuclear officials from Sweden to China said no radiation spikes had been reported, as did Grossi. Ukrainian officials have said Russian troops took control of the overall site, but the plant’s staff were continuing to ensure its operations. Grossi said the Ukrainians were in control of the reactor.

In the frenzied initial aftermath when the risk of a radiation release was not clear, the attack caused worldwide concern — and evoked memories of the world’s worst nuclear disaster, at Ukraine’s Chernobyl.

Facing worldwide indignation over the attack, Russia sought to deflect blame. Without producing evidence, Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov blamed arson rather than artillery fire. He claimed a Ukrainian “sabotage group” had occupied the training building at the plant, fired on a Russian patrol and set fire to the building as they left.

There had been conflicting reports earlier over which part of the Zaporizhzhia facility had been affected in the attack, with an official saying at one point that shells fell directly on the facility and set fire to a reactor not in operation as well as a training building. Grossi later said that the fire was in the training center.

The confusion itself underscored the dangers of active fighting near a nuclear power plant. It was the second time since the invasion began just over a week ago that concerns about a nuclear accident or a release of radiation materialized, following a battle at Chernobyl.

Grossi said only one reactor of six at Zaporizhzhia is currently operating, at about 60% capacity, and that two people at the site were injured in the fire. Ukraine’s state nuclear plant operator Enerhoatom said three Ukrainian soldiers were killed and two wounded.

Trying to block sea access

The plant fire came as the Russian military advanced on a strategic city on the Dnieper River near where the facility is located, and gained ground in their bid to cut the country off from the sea. That move would deal a severe blow to Ukraine's economy and could worsen an already dire humanitarian situation.

With the invasion in its second week, another round of talks between Russia and Ukraine yielded a tentative agreement to set up safe corridors to evacuate citizens and deliver humanitarian aid to the country, overturned by a war that has sent more than 1 million fleeing over the border and countless others sheltering underground. A handful cities are without heat and at least one is struggling to get food and water.

In the center of the capital, Kyiv, frequent shelling could still be heard Friday, although more distant than in recent days, with loud thudding every 10 minutes resonating over the rooftops.

The West has heaped sanctions on Russia, and most of the world lined up to demand Russia withdraw its troops in a vote in the U.N. General Assembly this week. In the latest show of international opposition to the invasion, the U.N.’s top human rights body voted 32-2 on a resolution that would among other things set up a panel of experts to monitor human rights in Ukraine. Only Russia and Eritrea opposed; there were 13 abstentions.

U.S. activates nuclear response team

The attack on the nuclear facility led to phone calls between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and U.S. President Joe Biden and other world leaders. The U.S. Department of Energy activated its nuclear incident response team as a precaution.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council to raise the issue of Russia’s attack on the plant.

In an emotional speech in the middle of the night, Zelenskyy said he feared an explosion that would be “the end for everyone. The end for Europe. The evacuation of Europe.”

But most experts saw nothing to indicate an impending disaster.

“The real threat to Ukrainian lives continues to be the violent invasion and bombing of their country,” the American Nuclear Society said in a statement.

Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces have brought their superior firepower to bear over the past few days, launching hundreds of missiles and artillery attacks on cities and other sites around the country and making significant gains in the south.

The Russians announced the capture of the southern city of Kherson, a vital Black Sea port of 280,000, and local Ukrainian officials confirmed the takeover of the government headquarters there, making it the first major city to fall since the invasion began just over a week ago.

No heat, electricity

A Russian airstrike on Thursday destroyed a power plant in Okhtyrka, leaving the northeastern city without heat or electricity, the head of the region said on Telegram.

“We are trying to figure out how to get people out of the city urgently because in a day the apartment buildings will turn into a cold stone trap without water, light or electricity,” Dmytro Zhyvytskyy said.

Another strategic port, Mariupol on the Azov Sea, was “partially under siege,” and Ukrainian forces are pushing back efforts to surround the city, Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovich said Friday.

“The humanitarian situation is tense,” he told reporters, adding that Ukrainian authorities are in talks with Russian representatives and international organizations to set up humanitarian corridor to evacuate residents and supply food.

Battles in the area have knocked out the city’s electricity, heat and water systems, as well as most phone service, officials said. Food deliveries to the city were also cut.

Associated Press video from the port city Thursday showed the assault lighting up the darkening sky above deserted streets and medical teams treating civilians, including a 16-year-old boy who could not be saved. The child was playing soccer when he was wounded in the shelling, according to his father, who cradled the boy’s head on the gurney and cried.

Ukraine’s defense minister said Friday that the flagship of its navy has been scuttled at the shipyard where it was undergoing repairs in order to keep it from being seized by Russian forces. Oleksii Reznikov said on Facebook that the commander of the frigate Hetman Sahaidachny decided to flood the ship.

“It is hard to imagine a more difficult decision for a courageous soldier and crew,” Reznikov said.

Ukraine’s state emergency agency issued mass text messages Friday with advice on what to do in case of an explosion: Lie on the ground and cover your head with your hands; use available shelter; do not rush to leave the shelter; help the wounded; do not enter damaged buildings.

Overall, the outnumbered, outgunned Ukrainians have put up stiff resistance, staving off the swift victory that Russia appeared to have expected. But Russia's seizure of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 gives it a logistical advantage now in the country's south, with shorter supply lines that smoothed the offensive there, said a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Ukrainian leaders called on the people to defend their homeland by cutting down trees, erecting barricades in the cities and attacking enemy columns from the rear. In recent days, authorities have issued weapons to civilians and taught them how to make Molotov cocktails.

As the Russian and Ukrainian negotiators met in Belarus on Thursday, Putin warned in a call with French President Emmanuel Macron that Ukraine must quickly accept the Kremlin’s demand for its “demilitarization” and declare itself neutral, renouncing its bid to join NATO.

The two sides said they tentatively agreed to allow cease-fires in areas designated safe corridors, and that they would seek to work out the necessary details quickly. A Zelenskyy adviser also said a third round of talks will be held early next week.

The Pentagon set up a direct communication link to Russia’s Ministry of Defense earlier this week to avoid the possibility of a miscalculation sparking conflict between Moscow and Washington, according to a U.S. defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the link had not been announced.
