The Croatian president, Zoran Milanović, said it was clear the drone came from Ukraine. A statement issued by Croatia’s government said the “pilotless military aircraft” entered Croatian airspace from neighbouring Hungary at a speed of 700km/h (434mph) and an altitude of 1,300 metres (4,265ft).

The Croatian prime minister, Andrej Plenković, said: “According to information I have so far, this flying object was Russian-manufactured, we are not sure whether it belongs to the Russian or Ukrainian army.”

He added that it had come from the direction of Hungary, and that according to the prime minister there, Viktor Orbán, it had arrived via Romania.

The Croatian government said an official criminal investigation would be launched and that Nato would be informed of the incident. The large drone flew for at least 350 miles (560km) apparently undetected by air defences in Croatia, Hungary and Romania, all members of the western military alliance.

Military experts of the War Zone online magazine said the aircraft was likely to have been a Soviet-era Tu-141 Strizh reconnaissance drone that must have severely malfunctioned. It said Ukraine was the only known operator of the Tu-141.

The Ukrainian defence ministry adviser, Markian Lubkivskiy, was quoted by the Interfax news agency as denying the drone was Ukrainian. He put the blame for the incident on Russia.

“This drone did not have Ukrainian markings,” he was quoted as saying. “There were red stars on it” – a symbol of the Russian military.

The Russian embassy in Zagreb said the drone was made in Ukraine and that Russian forces had stopped using Tu-141s since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.

Milanović said “the serious incident” must be thoroughly investigated to determine “how a relatively unsophisticated drone flew for over an hour over Nato countries without being detected”.

He said that the drone crashed in Zagreb after running out of fuel.

The Croatian defence minister and the army chief of staff both described the drone incident as serious, but said more details would be revealed after the ongoing investigation.

The two officials said at a news conference that Croatia responded by closing its airspace. They said they had been in contact with neighbouring countries and Nato and could not reveal whose drone it was.

“We can’t say at this moment whose it was. Those are relatively old-era flying objects that were used in the Soviet Union,” said chief of staff Adm Robert Hranj. “I can’t even say it flew from Ukraine without detailed analysis.”

Hungary’s foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, said in a social media post that Hungarian authorities were also investigating the crash.

“According to the information currently available, the airspace of several Nato member states, including Hungary, was involved in the drone flight,” he said.

The mayor of Zagreb Tomislav Tomašević said parts of the flying object were scattered in several locations. He said authorities were working to determine how the incident happened and that initial findings indicated it was an accident.

The drone came down in the residential district of Jarun, in south-west Zagreb. “No one was hurt and that is good fortune,” said Tomašević. “It is a relatively big object. It is amazing that no one was hurt.”

The Croatian police said they came to the scene after calls from local people. They said they found a large crater and two parachutes in a wooded area. Some parked cars were damaged. The site is near a large student dormitory.

Photos from the scene show metal pieces of the wreckage scattered on the ground, a parachute hanging from tree branches and what seems to be a section of a wing. Police sealed off the area of the blast for investigation. The Tu-141 has parachutes used for soft landings.

Witnesses quoted by the media said they first heard a large explosion that rocked the ground, followed by a foul smell.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/ukraine-military-drone-crashes-into-croatian-capital-zagreb

The drone, flying at 1,300 metres, came from Hungary and crashed seven minutes after entering Croatia's air space, the government said. Both Hungary and Croatia are NATO members.

Hungary's Defence Ministry said in a reply to Reuters questions that the Tupolev TU-141 drone was detected by radar in Hungarian airspace. It had been detected over Ukraine and then it entered Hungary via Romanian air space.

""Under continuous monitoring and controls from the time when it entered Hungary, it left Hungarian air space,"" the ministry said, adding that there was a similar event on Friday in the northeast of Hungary when Gripen fighter jets belonging to Hungary checked but found no trace of any flying objects.

""Due to the Ukraine military conflict it is especially important that we handle such events calmly,"" it added.

Croatian President Zoran Milanovic said that according to preliminary information the drone originally came from Ukraine and crashed once it had run out of fuel.

""We estimate that this was an incident and it was not (military action) directed against Croatia,"" Milanovic said.

Defence Minister Mario Banozic declined to comment on details.

""This was a very serious incident. We will have to investigate it thoroughly,"" Banozic told press conference.

He said it was unclear whether the drone belonged to Russia or Ukraine. He also declined to say from where the drone could have originated.

""The investigation will reveal further details,"" he said.

Russia invaded Ukraine two weeks ago. Russian forces bearing down on the capital Kyiv were regrouping northwest of the city, satellite pictures showed, and Britain said Moscow could now be planning an assault within days. read more

Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said Hungary was closely cooperating with Croatia and other NATO allies.

""Our authorities are examining what happened, as according to present data, the air space of several NATO members including Hungary was affected by the drone's flight.""

5,95a1b17d-407d-487d-8a27-dfb1357a4f70,[],2022-03-12 08:10:00-05:00,"ZAGREB, CROATIA -- Croatian officials criticized NATO Saturday for what they said was its slow reaction to a military drone that apparently flew from the Ukrainian war zone through the airspace of three NATO member states, before crashing in the Croatian capital.

The Russian-made unmanned aircraft crossed Romania and Hungary before entering Croatia and slamming late Thursday into a field near a student dormitory. Some 40 parked cars were damaged but no one was injured after a loud blast.

NATO said the alliance's integrated air and missile defence had tracked the object's flight path. But the Croatian prime minister said the country's authorities were not informed and that NATO reacted only after question were posed by journalists.

""We cannot tolerate this situation, nor should it have ever happened,"" Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said while visiting the crash site.

""This was a pure and clear threat and both NATO and the EU should have reacted,"" he said. ""We will work to raise the readiness not only of us but of others as well. ""

Plenkovic said a Soviet-era Tu-141 ""Strizh"" reconnaissance drone flew for over 40 minutes over Hungary and six to seven minutes over Croatia before crashing. Earlier, Romanian defense authorities said the drone was in Romania's airspace for only three minutes after crossing from Ukraine, making it hard to intercept.

Plenkovic called on Hungarian authorities to launch an investigation into why its defenses apparently did not notice the unmanned drone as both Croatia and Romania had little time to react to the fast-moving object.

""Fortunately, something much worse did not happen,"" Plenkovic said, adding that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban ""found out about this after me.""

""This could have fallen on the nuclear power plant in Hungary. Obviously there was no good reaction and other countries did not react well. Now we have a test from which we have to learn and react much better,"" he said.

He said that only an investigation can determine who launched the drone -- the Russians or the Ukrainians -- after the aircraft is pulled out of a large crater created after impact.

Both Russia and Ukraine have denied they launched the drone.

Russian troops shelled a cancer hospital in the southern city of Mykolaiv, Ukraine, with heavy artillery while hundreds of patients were inside, Ukrainian officials said.

No one was killed in the attack that left the building damaged, head doctor Maksim Beznosenko said.

Mykolaiv is just under 300 miles south of Kyiv.

“The Russian invaders cannot conquer us. They do not have such strength. They do not have such spirit. They are holding only on violence. Only on terror,” he says.

He says Russia’s professional class is fleeing the country.

“We still need to hold on. We still need to fight. Every day and every night we must look for ways to cause maximum damage to the enemy,” he says.

He says “Ukraine will not forgive” any collaborators.

He says humanitarian corridors are working and 12,729 people evacuated today.
