Example video title will go here for this video

RZESZOW, Poland — President Joe Biden’s visit to Poland on Friday gave him a chance to underscore the U.S. commitment to protect a key NATO member on Ukraine’s doorstep and to thank Poles for their generous welcome to refugees fleeing Russia's invasion.

But Poland is also a complicated ally whose populist leaders are accused by some European partners of riding roughshod over democratic norms, and liberal Poles will be seeking a sign that the U.S. remembers its role in promoting democracy.

Biden's two-day visit follows a trio of emergency summits in Brussels and brought him to the country that has accepted the lion’s share of the more than 3.5 million people who have fled Ukraine. More than 2.2 million refugees have entered Poland since the start of the month-old war, and many propose to stay there.

Polish assistance to Ukrainians has won praise near and far. Not only have shelters and schools opened their doors to refugees, with 90,000 children registering to attend classes, but many regular Poles have welcomed Ukrainians into their homes. In some cases, they're taking in friends and in others, complete strangers.

President Andrzej Duda, who is allied with a right-wing political party accused of eroding democratic norms, and who clearly preferred former U.S. President Donald Trump to Biden, was set to welcome his American counterpart upon Air Force One's arrival in Rzeszow, a city some 70 kilometers (45 miles) from the border with Ukraine.

But Duda arrived late due to a technical problem with his own plane, which had to make an emergency landing in Warsaw. The delay forced Biden to change his schedule and to meet before a briefing on the humanitarian crisis facing Ukrainians with American soldiers who are serving alongside Polish troops on NATO's eastern flank.

He lavished praise on the members of the U.S. Army’s 82nd Airborne Division and told them they were in the midst of a fight between democracy and autocracy.

The soldiers Biden met are among thousands of additional U.S. troops deployed due to Russia’s war in Ukraine and come in addition to thousands deployed on a rotating basis since Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014. Many Poles find their presence reassuring: Russia’s March 13 strikes on the Yavoriv military base in western Ukraine were so close that they were felt or seen in border communities.

At the same time, many Poles will be hoping for a sign from Biden that Washington will continue to urge the Polish government's adherence to democratic values, hoping that won’t be forgotten amid the need for wartime NATO unity.

During his election campaign, Biden mentioned Poland along with Belarus and Hungary in warning about “the rise of totalitarian regimes in the world.” The comment caused offense to leaders in Poland, which has become a refuge for dissidents from authoritarian Belarus.

The European Union has accused Poland of eroding judicial independence since the Law and Justice party started governing in 2015. The EU sees political interference in the judiciary as an attack on the 27-member bloc’s fundamental democratic values, and particularly objects to a Supreme Court body with powers to suspend judges whose rulings displease government authorities.

Recently, the EU withheld millions of euros from a pandemic recovery fund from Warsaw, seeking to use the money as leverage for change.

Poland’s government has also incurred international criticism for eroding media independence, for anti-LGBT rhetoric by Duda and others, and over the use of Pegasus spyware against government critics.

The Justice Defense Committee, an umbrella group in Poland that includes independent judges, prosecutors and civil groups, alleged in a March 13 letter to EU institutions that since the war in Ukraine began, Polish authorities have “taken a number of measures to further destroy the rule of law.”

The government denies its behavior has been undemocratic, noting that it keeps winning elections and arguing that it is trying to reform a corrupt, inefficient court system.

Duda late last year moved to ease one key U.S. concern, vetoing legislation that threatened to silence an independent broadcaster, TVN. The legislation would have forced Discovery Inc., a American company that owns TVN, to give up its majority stake in the broadcaster — the largest ever U.S. investment in Poland.

Biden, however, will likely not have forgotten that Duda and other Polish officials were ardent supporters and ideological brethren of Trump, particularly in their opposition to accepting Middle Eastern refugees and migrants.

Duda was among a handful of leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, who waited weeks before congratulating Biden after he won the 2020 election, taking a wait-and-see approach as Trump refused to accept his defeat.

In 2018, while asking the U.S. to establish a permanent military base in Poland, Duda proposed calling it ""Fort Trump.”

The proposal sparked some mockery in Europe and was quickly dropped. Poles continue to want a permanent base and a greater U.S. military presence as safeguards against Russian aggression. They hope Biden's visit to Poland will bring stronger military commitments.

Before Biden returns to Washington on Saturday, he is expected to address the Polish people.

The White House said he would “deliver remarks on the united efforts of the free world to support the people of Ukraine, hold Russia accountable for its brutal war, and defend a future that is rooted in democratic principles.”

1,af85f34a-873f-4114-be0c-1240de6b9163,"['Chris Megerian And Darlene Superville', 'Associated Press', 'March']",2022-03-25 20:27:05,"60 miles from Ukraine, Biden sees refugee crisis in Poland

RZESZOW, Poland — Just 60 miles from Ukraine, President Joe Biden saluted Poland on Friday for welcoming more than 2 million refugees who have fled Russia's invasion. Then he met with humanitarian experts on the ground about what will be needed to mitigate the growing suffering.

Biden said he had hoped to get even closer to the border but was prevented because of security concerns. Still, he said he wanted to visit Poland to underscore that the assistance it is providing is of “enormous consequence"" as Europe experiences the biggest refugee crisis since World War II.

“It’s not stopping,"" Biden said of the devastation in Ukraine. ""It’s like something out of a science fiction movie.”

Biden also visited with some of the thousands of U.S. troops who have been sent near Poland’s border to assist with the humanitarian emergency and to bolster the U.S. military presence on the eastern flank of NATO. More than 3.5 million Ukrainians have fled the country since the Feb. 24 invasion, including about 2.2 million to Poland, according to the United Nations.

Within a few days, the number of refugees displaced from Ukraine since last month will exceed the number of Syrians routed from their homes over years of conflict after a 2011 uprising turned into a full-scale war, said Samantha Power, the U.S. Agency for International Development administrator.

The American military commitment in Poland was apparent as soon as Air Force One touched down, rolling past Patriot missile batteries. More hardware, including heavy trucks and other equipment painted with dark green and brown camouflage, was present at the airport. A nearby convention center serves as a base for the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne Division.

Polish President Andrzej Duda joined Biden for a briefing with humanitarian experts.

Duda, through an interpreter, thanked Biden for his support. He said the Poles see the Ukrainians they are receiving as their “guests.”

“This is the name we want to apply to them,"" Duda said. “We do not want to call them refugees. They are our guests, our brothers, our neighbors from Ukraine, who today are in a very difficult situation.”

Biden's first stop was with 82nd Airborne troops, at a barber shop and dining facility where he invited himself to sit down and share some pizza. The Americans are serving alongside Polish troops.

With the troops, he shared an anecdote about visiting his late son, Beau Biden, while he was deployed in Baghdad and going by his mother’s maiden name so as not to draw attention to himself. The president jokingly razzed one service member about his standard-issue short haircut and seriously praised the troops, too.

“You are the finest fighting force in the world and that's not hyperbole,. Biden said.

He later addressed a group of soldiers in more formal remarks, telling them the nation “owes you big.” He also borrowed the words of the late Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to underscore their place in a fragile moment for the U.S. and its European allies.

""The secretary of state used to have an expression. She said, ‘We are the essential nation,’"" Biden told the troops. “I don't want to sound philosophical here, but you are in midst of a fight between democracy and an an oligarch.""

Biden will be in Warsaw on Saturday for further talks with Duda and others. The Polish leader had planned to welcome him at the airport on Friday, but his plane was delayed by a technical problem.

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Biden was looking to hear directly from the American troops and humanitarian experts about the situation on the ground and “what further steps need to be taken to make sure that we’re investing” U.S. dollars in the right place.

Biden, who spent Thursday lobbying U.S. allies to stay united against Russia, speculated that what he sees in Poland “will reinforce my commitment to have the United States make sure we are a major piece of dealing with the relocation of all those folks, as well as humanitarian assistance needed both inside Ukraine and outside Ukraine.”

Speaking in Brussels after meetings with other world leaders, Biden said he had visited many war zones and refugee camps during his political career and “it's devastating” to see young children without parents or men and women with blank looks on their faces wondering, “My God, where am I? What's going to happen to me?”

He said Poland, Romania and Germany shouldn't be left on their own to deal with the largest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.

“This is an international responsibility,” Biden said shortly after he announced $1 billion in additional assistance to help Ukrainian refugees. He also announced that the United States would take in up to 100,000 of those refugees. The White House has said most Ukrainian refugees eventually want to return home.

Biden said the United States is obligated to be “engaged and do all we can to ease the suffering and pain of innocent women and children and men"" who make it across the border.

He said, “I plan on attempting to see those folks ... I hope I get to see a lot of people.”

Some refugees interviewed Friday at the train station in Przemysl, Poland, said they hoped to eventually return to Ukraine. They also weren't very hopeful about Biden's visit.

“For sure I do not have any expectations"" about Biden, said a tearful Ira Satula, 32, from Kremenchug. Satula was grateful for all the support and Poland's warm reception.

“But home is home, and I hope we'll be there soon,"" Satula said.

Olga Antonovna, 68, from Chernigov, said “it’s really 50-50"" that Biden will help enough.

“I think that we needed help a long time ago, long before,” she said.

Sullivan said Biden will give a speech Saturday on “the stakes of this moment, the urgency of the challenge that lies ahead, what the conflict in Ukraine means for the world.”

'You’re going to see when you’re there – some of you have been there – you’re going to see women, young people, standing in the middle, in front of a damn tank, saying, ""I’m not leaving"",' Biden said in a speech to the 82nd Airborne Division.

Biden's mention of 'when you're there' seem to suggest that the troops would be deployed across the border, but the administration insisted there has been no change in stance.

'The president has been clear we are not sending U.S. troops to Ukraine and there is no change in that position,' a White House spokesperson told Fox News on Friday.

Biden has persistently said that troops would not be sent into Ukraine under any circumstances during Putin's invasion, fearing it would turn into World War Three and end up becoming a lengthy combat mission like in Afghanistan.

Biden also talked about his late son Beau and thanked the paratroopers for their service in the during the remarks in Rzeszów.

The president recalled when he went to Iraq in 2009 to visit Beau, who was stationed there as part of his service in the Delaware National Guard, he discovered his son was using the last name Hunter.

The White House was forced to clarify on Friday that American troops would not be going into Ukraine after President Biden appeared to make a slip in his speech to paratroopers in Poland

'You’re going to see when you’re there – some of you have been there – you’re going to see women, young people, standing in the middle, in front of a damn tank, saying, ""I’m not leaving"".' Biden's mention of 'you're there' seem to suggest that the troops would be deployed across the border, but the administration insisted there has been no change in stance

Biden said asked what was going on. Beau told his dad that the name 'Biden' could be a hassle where he was, and so was instead going by 'Hunter.'

Hunter was the maiden name of Beau's mother, who died in a car crash in 1972. It's also the name of his younger brother, the president's only living son Hunter.

Biden regularly mentions his late son when he visits service members. And Thursday's trip to visit the 82nd Airborne Division he deployed to Europe during Russia's invasion of the Ukraine was no exception.

The president ate pizza and took selfies during his visit.

'You are the finest fighting force in the world and that's not hyperbole,' Biden said before sitting down on a folding chair to eat.

'Don’t stop eating because of me,' he said when he walked into the cafeteria and saw the paratroopers munching on the pie provided by the White House.

Biden also visited the barber shop, where one of the service men suggested that maybe Biden should finish the haircut. Biden laughed and said that was the last thing the young man would want.

And he made jokes with the division that specializes in parachute assault operations.

'Don't jump. You guys are used to jumping. Don't jump. Anyway, thanks for letting me come to say hello to you all,' he told the room full of service members.

He praised them for their duty, telling them they upheld the values seen in the American Declaration of Independence.

'You know, we're a unique country in many ways. And we are the only country, the only country in the world not organized based on geography, ethnicity, raced or anything else. We're based on idea. We hold these truths to be self-evident that all women and men are created equal. Sounds corny, it's the truth of who we are,' he said.

Biden was joined by Polish President Andrzej Duda, at one point reaching along a table to grab his hand and explain that a 'pizza pie' with hot peppers was making him cough

Biden says he was told he couldn't cross the border into Ukraine and refers to invasion and civilian courage as 'Tiananmen Square squared'

During a meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda later on Friday, he reached for new words and analogies to find ways to try to describe the horrors Ukrainians are facing Thursday – comparing blown out landscapes to something 'out of a science fiction movie.'

After landing in Rzeszow near the Ukrainian border, Biden also spoke to the bravery of Ukrainian citizens rising up to try to counter the Russian invasion,' comparing them to protesters who resisted a Chinese government crackdown.

At an event where he was briefed on efforts to coordinate the humanitarian response, Biden spoke of the 'courage and passion for resilience of the Ukrainian people.'

'When you see a 30-year old woman standing there in front of a tank with a rifle. I mean, talk about what happened in Tiananmen Square? This is Tiananmen Square, squared,' Biden said.

He was referencing the iconic 1989 image where a lone man stood in front of a tank to try to stop the government crackdown.

There have been similar scenes in Ukraine, where ordinary citizens used their bodies and and personal appeals to try to stop Russian armor – even as Ukrainian troops take a toll of their by blowing up Russian equipment with arms provided by the U.S. and allies.

'It's like something out of a science fiction movie': President Joe Biden described some of the horrific images emerging from Ukraine

Forgetting numbers, confusing Libya and Syria, calling Kamala 'president' and hot mic blunders: Biden's gaffes that have raised health concerns As the oldest person ever sworn in to the White House, President Joe Biden has faced questions and concerns over his mental as well as physical acuity since taking one one of the most stressful jobs in the world. But aside from his advanced age, Biden, 79, has worried even supporters with numerous gaffes over the year he's been in office. Most recently, Rep. Ronny Jackson pointed out in a letter demanding Biden take a cognitive test that one of the first signs of Alzheimer's Disease is erratic changes in mood or personality. January 24, 2022 - Biden calls Peter Doocy a 'stupid son of a b*****' 'You displayed this type of mood change during a cabinet meeting on when you apparently did not know your microphone was on after finishing your opening remarks, and you called a White House reporter a 'stupid son of a b****'in response to a question asked on inflation,' Jackson claimed. He was referring to a hot mic moment in late January during which Biden criticized Fox News reporter Peter Doocy, after which the president personally apologized to the journalist. Biden has also been known to have trouble with the names of his most senior officials, foreign leaders and even countries. At last year's G7 in June, the president bungled the names of Syria and Libya multiple times when discussing security efforts with Russia. The White House was later forced to issue a clarification. Another embarrassing foreign policy faux pas occurred in September 2021, when Biden appeared to forget the name of Australia's prime minister -- who was appearing via video link right beside him. While announcing a historic security deal between the UK, US and Australia, Biden told Britain's Boris Johnson, 'Thank you, Boris,' before turning to Australia's Scott Morrison and saying: 'And I want to thank that fella down under. Thank you very much pal.' Biden has seemingly even struggled with names of people he speaks to more regularly. He gave a speech marking International Women's Day in March of last year, during which he was promoting two female officers to four-star generals. March 8, 2022 - Slipping and forgetting Lloyd Austin's name The president slipped up during the March 8 speech while trying to remember Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's name. 'I want to thank Sec-, the former general, I keep calling him 'General.' My - the guy who runs that outfit over there,' Biden said, before quickly adding, 'I want to make sure we thank the secretary for all he's done.' A trip to Texas that same month to visit a Houston-area vaccination center saw Biden apparently lose his train of thought and become confused. He even asked, 'What am I doing here?' while trying to get himself back on track. On multiple occasions Biden has also appeared to refer to Vice President Kamala Harris as the 'president.' During a commencement speech at South Carolina State University in late December, Biden remarked: 'Of course, President Harris is a proud Howard alum.' He made the mistake again more recently, declaring during a voting rights speech in Georgia on January 11 that 'President Harris and I stood on the United States Capitol.' Biden has been known to get dates confused as well -- in May 2021 he recalled traveling via Amtrak to see his mother while he was vice president in 2013. But his mother had died in 2010. The apparent issues began long before Biden took the White House. When he was on the campaign trail in September 2020, then-candidate Biden was widely mocked for saying '200 million people have died' from COVID-19 under Donald Trump's watch. The number was around 200,000 at the time. And while president, Biden had to be corrected on a statistic regarding COVID-19 vaccinations. During a COVID-19 White House press conference, Biden attempted to say, '57… excuse me… 570… I don't want to read it, I'm not sure I got the right number…' Chief Medical Adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci aided him to say the figure was '57 million.' Confusing Libya and Syria 'I'm hopeful that we can find an accommodation where we can save the lives of people in — for example, in — in Libya,' the president said, mentioning the north African country for the third time instead of Syria, in the Middle East. Biden is pictured in Cornwall, United Kingdom on June 13 The White House later brushed the confusion off, confirming that it was indeed, Syria, the country where Russia and the US have been involved in a decade-long civil war, which the president was referring to Biden repeatedly confused Syria with Libya while discussing ways of working with Russia during a press conference at the G7 on June 13. The 78-year-old gaffe machine spoke of working with Russian President Vladimir Putin to provide economic assistance to the people of Libya, prompting some confused glances from the press pack at the G7 summit in Cornwall, England. 'I'm hopeful that we can find an accommodation where we can save the lives of people in — for example, in — in Libya,' the president said, mentioning the north African country for the third time instead of Syria, which is in the Middle East. The White House later brushed the confusion off, confirming that the president was indeed referring to Syria, the country where Russia and the US have been involved in a decade-long civil war. Tripping while climbing the Air Force One stairs Over the years, President Joe Biden has made numerous gaffes and mix-ups and has even been caught falling. Pictured: Biden falling while walking up the stairs of Air Force One on March 19 On March 19, he was caught tripping up the stairs as he boarded Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews Advertisement

On March 19, video captured Biden tripping up the stairs as he boarded Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews.

In the clip, Biden stumbles as he walks up the airstairs. He grabs the hand railing to catch his balance, but then loses his footing two additional times.

During the third stumble, he falls to his knees. However, after brushing off his leg, he reaches the top of the plane and gives a salute before disappearing inside.

White House Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre later told reporters that Biden was '100 percent fine' and preparing for his trip in Atlanta.

'It's pretty windy outside. It's very windy. I almost fell coming up the steps myself,' she said.

Just one day earlier, during a press conference on March 18 (pictured), he referred to Vice President Kamala Harris as 'President Harris'

Just one day earlier, Biden accidentally referred to Vice President Kamala Harris as 'President Harris.'

The gaffe occurred during a press conference on March 18, during which he lauded his administration for being close to meeting their goal of 100 million COVID-19 vaccine doses in his first 100 days in office.

'Now when President Harris and I took a virtual tour of a vaccination center in Arizona not long ago, one of the nurses on that, on that tour injecting people, giving vaccinations, said that each shot was like administering a dose of hope,' Biden said.

Harris was standing behind Biden as the president carried on with his speech, but did not correct himself.

Later that day, when the White House released the transcript of his speech, Harris's proper title was inserted with brackets.

On March 9, while making a speech, Biden seemed to forget the name of Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin (above)

In a speech on March 9, Biden seemed to fumble with his words and forget the name of his Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin.

'I want to thank Sec - the former general - I keep calling him 'General,'' Biden said.

'My - the guy who runs that outfit over there. I want to make sure we thank the Secretary for all he's done to try to implement what we've just talked about, and for recommending these two women for promotion.' The slip-occurred despite the fact that just a few minutes earlier, he had mentioned Austin's name in the speech without an issue.

On Election Day, in November, Biden introduced a crowd to his granddaughter, but referred to her as his son

During an Election Day speech in Philadelphia, Biden stumbled over his words and confused his granddaughter with his late son, Beau Biden.

Biden told the crowd: 'I want to introduce you to two of my granddaughters...this is my son, Beau Biden who a lot of you helped elect to the Senate in Delaware.'

The commander-in-chief had meant to introduce the crowed to Natalie, Beau's daughter, but hadn't just mixed up the name but the person - he also put his arm around Finnegan Biden, Hunter's daughter.

He finally corrected himself as he draped his arm around Natalie's shoulder and said: 'This is Natalie, this is Beau's daughter.'

Beau Biden passed away in 2015 after a months-long battle with glioblastoma, one of the deadliest types of brain cancer.

TOLD STATE SENATOR IN WHEELCHAIR TO STAND UP

In 2008, Biden told then-Missouri state senator Chuck Graham to stand up for the crowd at a rally, before realizing he was in a wheelchair

Not all of Biden's gaffes occurred in the 2020s or even the 2010s. In fact, some happened in the early aughts.

In September 2008, after Biden had been named former President Barack Obama's running mate, he attended a campaign rally in Missouri.

It was there that he called on then-Missouri state senator Chuck Graham, who passed away last year. to stand up for the crowd.

'I'm told Chuck Graham, state senator, is here. Stand up Chuck, let 'em see you,' Biden said.

It was at that moment he realized Graham was in a wheelchair due to muscular dystrophy.

'Oh, God love you. What am I talking about. I'll tell you what, you're making everybody else stand up, though, pal.'

According to the Columbia Tribune, Graham said he was never offended by the mistake.

The president cited UN figures saying 12 million Ukrainians need assistance, with thousands of civilian casualties since the invasion a month ago.

'Hundreds of thousands of people are being cut off from health by Russian forces and are being besieged in places like Mariupol. I mean, it's not stopping. It's like something out of a science fiction movie. Turn on the television and see what these towns look like, and cities,' he said.

He spoke on a day when new video emerged of the destruction inside a theater in Mariupol, where Ukrainian authorities said 300 people had died in the Russian attack. Images after the building was struck show Ukrainian women and children covered in dust trying to leave the once stately building.

Biden also spoke Friday to members of the storied 182nd Airborne Division – lauding troops for both assisting in relief and helping protect NATO's eastern flank amid. The administration says officials are preparing for 'contingencies' should Russia try attack NATO territory to try to stop efforts to arm the Ukrainians.

Biden alluded to his many past trips to war zones, some during his decades as a senator.

The war has brought devastation on Kiev and other cities. Firefighters work at a factory destroyed after it was hit by Russian shelling in Chaiky district of Kyiv, Ukraine on 24 March, 2022

'When you see a 30-year old woman standing there in front of a tank with a rifle. I mean, talk about what happened in Tiananmen Square? This is Tiananmen Square, squared,' Biden said of the Ukraine invasion

'Quite frankly, part of my disappointment is that I can't see it firsthand like I have in other places. They will not let me understandably I guess cross the border and take a look at what’s going on in Ukraine,' he said.

Biden does plan to meet with Ukrainian refugees here in Warsaw on Friday.

Biden was joined by Polish President Andrzej Duda, at one point reaching along a table to grab his hand and explain that a 'pizza pie' with hot peppers was making him cough.

Duda, who suffered an apparent aircraft mishap earlier in the day, thanked U.S. troops for providing security and U.S.-based NGOs who were aiding relief efforts. He called the estimated 2 million Ukrainian refugees in his country 'guests.'

Of U.S. troops, he said: 'They are guarding the security of the Polish border and guarding the security also of the entire European community.

In images from the start of the invasion, Ukrainians were filmed blocking Russian armor while screaming 'invaders, killers' and ordering them to stop. One video showed a group of fearless Ukrainians leaping on a Russian military vehicle while waving blue and yellow flags.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10653329/White-House-corrects-Biden-suggested-troops-sent-Ukraine.html
3,af85f34a-873f-4114-be0c-1240de6b9163,['Anita Powell'],,"U.S. President Joe Biden met with American troops during a visit to Poland on Friday in support of allied responses to the humanitarian and human rights crises sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as allies take new action to deter Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“You are in the midst of a fight between democracies and oligarchs,” Biden said as he met in Rzeszów with members of the U.S. Army’s 82nd Airborne Division, which is supporting thousands of other NATO troops in eastern flank countries that include Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Bulgaria and Romania.

Biden’s first visit with U.S. service members was in a makeshift barbershop at the division’s temporary headquarters. Biden then stopped at a dining facility for the troops, where he sat and shared pizza with them.

""You are the finest fighting force in the world and that's not hyperbole,” Biden said before sitting down to eat with the troops.

Biden also received a briefing at the Rzeszów-Jasionka Airport on the allied response to the humanitarian crisis and the growing number of refugees who are fleeing the violence in Ukraine.

Also attending the briefing was Polish President Andrzej Duda, who was scheduled to greet Biden when he first arrived in Poland earlier Friday in the eastern town of Rzeszów, nearly 100 kilometers from the Ukrainian border. Poland, a NATO ally, has taken in millions of Ukrainian refugees.

The Polish president’s plane, however, experienced a mechanical issue en route, forcing him to return to the capital, Warsaw. Duda later met with Biden after eventually arriving in Rzeszów.

Biden’s arrival in Poland came hours after meeting Friday in Brussels with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, after which they announced formation of a joint task force to reduce Europe’s dependence on Russian fossil fuels.

Biden said Putin has used the profits from its energy sales ""to drive his war machine"" in Ukraine. Biden said he wanted ""to make it clear that the American people would not be part of subsidizing Putin’s brutal, unjustified war against the people of Ukraine.""

""We are determined to stand up against Russia's brutal war,"" von der Leyen said. ""This war will be a strategic failure for Putin.""

The United States is providing Europe with 15 billion cubic meters of liquid natural gas this year.

In Ukraine, Russian forces are “faltering” east of the capital of Kyiv, British defense ministry official Mick Smeath said Friday, further denying Putin’s attempt to seize the capital.

Smeath told reporters that “Ukrainian counterattacks” and retreating Russian forces have allowed the Ukrainian military “to reoccupy towns and defensive position up to 35 kilometers east of Kyiv.”

Russia’s attempted drive toward the southwestern seaport city of Odesa is “being slowed by logistic issues and Ukrainian resistance,” Smeath said.

On Thursday, Biden said there would be a Western military response if Russia used chemical weapons in Ukraine.

""It would trigger a response in kind,"" Biden replied to a reporter's question during a news conference. ""Whether or not you're asking whether NATO would cross [into Ukraine to confront Russian forces], we'd make that decision at the time.""

He also said at NATO headquarters that Russia should be removed from the Group of 20 major economies and that Ukraine should be allowed to attend G-20 meetings.

Biden confirmed the issue was raised during his meetings with other world leaders Thursday as they marked one month since Russia invaded Ukraine.

Asked whether Ukraine needed to cede any territory to achieve a cease-fire with Russia, Biden responded, ""I don't believe that they're going to have to do that,"" but that is a decision for Kyiv to make.""

At his news conference, Biden said the United States was committing more than $1 billion in humanitarian assistance ""to help get relief to millions of Ukrainians affected by the war in Ukraine.""

""With a focus on reuniting families,"" the United States will welcome 100,000 Ukrainians and invest $320 million to support democratic resilience and defend human rights in Ukraine and neighboring countries, the president said.

NATO also announced Thursday that the defense alliance would bolster its capabilities after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had called on the organization's leaders to provide more weaponry to his country ""without limitations"" as Russia's invasion of Ukraine enters its second month.

Zelenskyy's appeal came as Biden met with NATO leaders to discuss their short- and long-term response to the Russian invasion.

Addressing the summit via video, Zelenskyy said his military needed fighter jets, tanks, and improved air and sea defense systems, as he warned Russia would attack NATO member Poland and other Eastern European countries.

""Russia has no intention of stopping in Ukraine,"" he declared. ""It wants to go further. Against Eastern members of NATO. The Baltic states. Poland, for sure.""

A White House statement issued Thursday said that ""between now and the NATO summit in June, we will develop plans for additional forces and capabilities to strengthen NATO's defenses.""

A Biden administration official told reporters that Zelenskyy did not reiterate on Thursday his demand for a no-fly zone, which NATO previously rejected on the grounds it would lead to direct conflict between NATO and Russia.

NATO members said in a joint statement after the summit that they would ""accelerate"" their commitment to invest at least 2% of their national budgets on the alliance, allowing for a significant strengthening of its ""longer term deterrence and defense posture.""

The alliance also vowed to ""further develop the full range of ready forces and capabilities necessary to maintain credible deterrence and defense.""

In addition to participating in the NATO talks, Biden met Thursday with G-7 leaders and the European Council.

The White House on Thursday announced a new round of sanctions targeting 48 Russian state-owned defense companies and more than 400 Russian political figures, oligarchs and other entities — an action Biden said was being done in alignment with the European Union.

Britain said Thursday its new package of sanctions includes freezing the assets of Gazprombank, a main channel for oil and gas payments, as well as Alfa Bank, a top private lender in Russia. Oil tycoon Evgeny Shvidler, Sberbank CEO Herman Gref and Polina Kovaleva, stepdaughter of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, are among individuals sanctioned.

Biden shared a meal with soldiers from the U.S. Army’s 82nd Airborne Division stationed in the area of Rzeszow airport, and spoke about the high stakes of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

“You are in the midst of a fight between democracies and oligarchs,” Biden said, referring to rich Russians who have faced Western sanctions since the war started on Feb. 24. “What’s at stake is what are your kids and grandkids going to look like in terms of their freedom,” Biden said.

Biden’s schedule in Poland was briefly delayed after the plane carrying President Andrzej Duda was turned back en route to Rzeszow and made an emergency landing in Warsaw. Duda later boarded a different aircraft and headed back.

An official in his office said Duda had not been in any danger in the incident, which for many Poles brought back memories of the 2010 Smolensk air crash in Russia that killed top military officers and politicians, including President Lech Kaczynski.

“We all know the history we have when it comes to flights,” Duda told reporters. “I did not argue, that was the decision of the plane’s captain,” he said, adding that the passengers could feel that the plane had become unstable.

Biden received a briefing on the humanitarian response to help civilians sheltering from Russian attacks inside Ukraine and to respond to the growing flow of refugees fleeing Ukraine.

“I’m here in Poland to see first hand the humanitarian crisis,” he said at the start of a meeting with NGOs, U.S. and Polish officials and Duda. “Quite frankly part of my disappointment is I can’t see it first hand like I have in other places. They won’t let me, understandably, I guess, cross the border and take a look at what’s going on in Ukraine.”

Poland has taken in more than 2.23 million people fleeing violence in Ukraine, out of some 3.7 million all together who have poured over borders across central Europe during the last four weeks.

“Hundreds of thousands of people are being cut off from help by Russian forces and are besieged in places like Mariupol,” Biden said in a reference to the port city in eastern Ukraine which has been under siege since the war’s early days.

“It’s like something out of a science fiction movie.”

Biden told reporters in Brussels on Thursday that his visit will “reinforce my commitment to have the United States make sure we are a major piece of dealing with the relocation of all those folks, as well as humanitarian assistance needed both inside Ukraine and outside Ukraine.”

In Rzeszow, TV footage showed him sharing a pepperoni and jalapeno pizza and chatting with U.S. paratroopers gathered in the base’s cafeteria.

“I just came by to say thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.”

WESTERN REINFORCEMENT ON EASTERN FLANK

Biden on Thursday attended an unprecedented triple summit in Brussels of NATO, G7 nations and European leaders which addressed the continent’s worst conflict since the 1990s Balkans wars.

On Friday evening, he landed in the capital Warsaw. On Saturday, he was scheduled to have further talks with Duda and give what the White House described as a major address.

Poland hopes that Biden’s visit will underline the security assurances already made by the United States that it will defend “every inch” of NATO territory. Warsaw is keen to see even more U.S. troops stationed on NATO’s eastern flank.

Poland is also likely to raise the idea of an international peacekeeping mission involving troops being stationed in Ukraine, an idea first proposed by ruling party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski during a trip to Kyiv.

En route to Poland on Air Force One, national security adviser Jake Sullivan briefed reporters. Asked whether Russia would try to bomb convoys carrying supplies to Ukraine over land through NATO countries, Sullivan said: “We are doing contingency planning for the possibility that Russia chooses to strike NATO territory in that context or in any other context.

“And the president has been about as clear as one can be about his absolute determination to respond decisively, alongside the other members of our alliance if Russia attacks NATO,” Sullivan said.

He also suggested the United States and its allies could still impose new measures to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.

“Of course, there are additional measures to tighten the screws on sanctions, and we will be constantly reviewing those,” he said.

The latest: The weeks-long resistance in besieged Mariupol appeared to be cracking as Russian forces moved closer to capturing the seaside port city in southeastern Ukraine, with a Russian-imposed deadline for Ukrainian forces in the city to surrender passing early Sunday local time. Meanwhile, officials in the capital Kyiv and the western city of Lviv reported explosions Saturday. Moscow has withdrawn its forces from those regions to focus on eastern Ukraine, but airstrikes have continued.

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

RZESZOW, Poland — President Biden traveled to this southeastern Polish city Friday to visit U.S. troops deployed along NATO’s eastern fringe as a bulwark against Russian incursion, and to laud Poland’s humanitarian role in welcoming more than 2 million Ukrainian refugees. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight Biden, who met with members of the 82nd Airborne Division and Polish President Andrzej Duda, said he regretted that he could not cross the border into Ukraine, barely 60 miles away, to see the crisis firsthand.

But inside Ukraine, where Russia’s brutal onslaught continued, a senior aide to President Volodymyr Zelensky said officials were “very disappointed” in the outcome of the series of summits Wednesday among NATO and European Union leaders in Brussels that brought Biden to Europe.

“We expected more bravery. We expected some bold decisions,” Andriy Yermak, Zelensky’s chief of staff, told the Washington-based Atlantic Council via live video Friday.

U.S. and Ukrainian officials believe that the Russian operation has already failed in some respects, given strong Ukrainian resistance and heavy Russian losses, and Russia signaled Friday its aims might be narrowing. But Yermak’s remarks served as a reminder that Ukraine remains outmanned, outgunned and facing more destruction each day. The Pentagon said Friday Russia has begun to mobilize military reinforcements to possibly send into Ukraine.

By issuing a general statement of ongoing military support, while continuing to deny Ukraine’s requests to send it Soviet-era jet fighters, impose a no-fly zone against Russian aircraft over Ukraine, and speed the flow of more heavy weaponry, Yermak said, NATO “is just trying to ensure that it is not provoking Russia to a military conflict” with the West, calling the alliance’s inaction “appeasement.”

“We need very concrete things. But we still have to repeatedly remind you,” he said.

Yermak said Ukraine needs NATO to “close our sky” to Russian air power and provide “intelligence in real time,” as well as more antiaircraft and antitank weaponry — some of which is now in short supply in the West. He also pleaded for more long-range artillery, rocket launchers and small weapons.

“Without it,” Yermak said, “our war will not be able to stand.”

Far from an anticipated rush toward full occupation of a country with a far weaker military, Russia appeared Friday to have at least partially lost control of the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, on the Black Sea, according to defense officials, the first of a handful of midsized cities it has struggled to occupy in the five weeks since the invasion began.

Ukrainian forces, bolstered by armed civilians, have pushed back Russian advances in other parts of the country, as well. The Pentagon said Friday that Ukraine has made “incremental” progress against Russia outside the northern city of Chernihiv, and other offensives were underway in the western suburbs in Kyiv, the capital. A senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Pentagon, said that Russian troops, stalled outside Kyiv for weeks, have begun to establish defensive positions instead of prioritizing an advance.

While Russia’s objective in the invasion initially appeared to be seizing Kyiv, the Kremlin is now emphasizing its intention to control the Donbas region in the east, where Ukrainian troops have been fighting against two breakaway areas since 2014. Moscow has recognized the region as two separate “republics.”

“The combat potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has been considerably reduced, which … makes it possible to focus our core efforts on achieving the main goal, the liberation of Donbas,” Sergey Rudskoy, head of the Russian General Staff’s Main Operational Directorate, said in a speech Friday.

The renewed focus on Donbas could be a face-saving measure as the Russians fail to achieve their larger aims, such as the capture of Kyiv and decapitation of Ukraine’s government. Russians have made modest gains in the east, and their focus now may be to enlarge territory controlled by separatists and declare victory. It could also be designed as a ruse to allow beleaguered Russian troops to rest.

It is not clear whether Russian troops will be pulled from elsewhere to reinforce Donbas, the U.S. defense official said, but there is evidence that they have shifted how they fight in other places.

“It appears the Russians are for the moment not pursuing a ground offensive toward Kyiv,” the official said. “They are digging in. They are establishing defensive positions.”

Rudskoy also issued the first Russian casualty assessment since the beginning of March, saying that 1,351 service members have died, and 3,825 have been injured. NATO estimated Wednesday that 7,000-15,000 Russian troops have been killed in four weeks of fighting in Ukraine, according to an alliance senior military official.

The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under NATO ground rules, said the estimate was based on several factors, including information from Ukrainian officials, what the Russian side has released, and open sources. By comparison, Russia lost about 15,000 troops over a decade of war in Afghanistan after it invaded in late 1979.

Among the most recent Russian casualties, according to a Western official and a Ukrainian journalist, was Col. Yuri Medvedev, commanding officer of the 37th Motor Rifle Brigade, who was attacked and injured by troops under his command after they suffered heavy losses in the fighting outside Kyiv. The troops ran a tank into Medvedev, injuring both his legs, after their unit lost almost half its men, according to a Facebook post by journalist Roman Tsymbaliuk.

Although Tsymbaliuk said the colonel had been hospitalized, a senior Western official said he believed Medvedev had been killed.

Russia’s bombardment of Ukraine’s population centers and other targets continued, with the senior defense official reporting Moscow is flying 300 sorties over Ukraine per day — an increase over a week ago. On Friday, Ukraine’s air force also claimed that Russian missiles had hit a command center in Vinnytsia, in west-central Ukraine, “significantly” damaging some buildings.

The southern port city of Mariupol remained under heavy Russian attack and cut off from food, water and humanitarian assistance. Matilda Bogner, head of the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, said at a news conference Friday that her agency had received “increasing information” and satellite images of mass graves in Mariupol.

One mass grave identified appears to hold some 200 bodies, she said, although it remained unclear how many of the deceased were civilian casualties of the war.

Bogner said the U.N. human rights office had also documented 22 cases of Ukrainian officials disappearing or being forcibly detained in Russian-controlled territories, 13 of whom have since been released. A number of journalists in areas under Russian occupation in the southeast have disappeared or been killed.

In his remarks Friday, Yermak expressed gratitude to the United States and other Western countries, as has Zelensky in the numerous video addresses he has given to Western legislatures and other audiences. But, as has Zelensky, Yermak emphasized that Ukraine is the West’s front line against further Russian aggression that NATO must stop for its own security.

Biden, in Poland, touted an additional $1 billion he had previously announced to aid the millions of Ukrainians who have fled the violence into neighboring countries and beyond, as well as the millions displaced and suffering inside the country. The United States has also committed to provide more than $2 billion in military equipment under Biden, including Stinger man-portable anti-air defense missiles, and Javelin antitank weapons.

As Russia’s offensive was getting underway in late February, the State Department appealed to countries to which it had sold those weapons in the past to share those they could spare with Ukraine. The United States, it promised, would quickly issue the necessary waivers to transfer them to another country, and would backfill their arsenals with weapons sent from its own stockpiles.

But as the need in Ukraine has grown, some of those weapons, in particular Stingers, have been in increasingly short supply. Production lines for the missiles, which first entered service in 1981, ceased some time ago and “we are exploring options to more quickly replenish U.S. inventories, and backfill depleted stocks of allies and partners,” Defense Department spokeswoman Jessica R. Maxwell said.

“It will take time to revive the industrial base … to enable production to resume,” Maxwell said in an email. Among the options to fast-track production, she said, were adding additional workers to the production line and developing alternatives for obsolete components.

Mike Nachshen, senior director for international communications of Raytheon Missiles and Defense, which produces Stingers, said that they “recognize the urgent need to bolster inventories” and are working with government and industry “to accelerate production timelines so that we can deliver additional units of this critical combat capability as soon as possible.”

The administration is considering invoking the Defense Production Act, which gives the executive emergency authority to control domestic industries and speed up production of certain critical items. Both Biden and President Donald Trump invoked the act to deal with the covid-19 pandemic.

The U.S. promise to resupply U.S.-manufactured defense supplies sent from other nations to Ukraine is of particular importance to countries along NATO’s eastern flank, concerned about defending their own front lines in a possible confrontation with Russia.

In particular, Ukraine has asked for supplements to the Russian-made S-300 air defense system already in its arsenal, whose missiles fly higher and farther than the short-range Stingers. Slovakia and Bulgaria — which, like Ukraine, are former members of the Soviet-era Warsaw Pact — also possess the system, as does Greece.

Bulgaria and Greece have declined. Slovakia has said it would transfer the system, as long as the aging S-300 is immediately replaced, an action that requires a host of down-line changes to other capabilities once an alternative has been identified. In a visit to Slovakia last weekend, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said officials are working on it.

Radovan Javorcik, the Slovakian ambassador to the United States, said in an email this week that his government was in “close consultation” with allies, but “until a concrete replacement of the S-300 system has been identified, Slovakia will not be able to decide on a possible donation of the system.”

Russia signaled a possible recalibration of its war aims in Ukraine on Friday as the Kremlin faced spreading global ostracism for the brutal invasion, hardened Western economic punishments and a determined Ukrainian resistance that appeared to be making some gains on the ground.

A statement by Russia’s Defense Ministry said the goals of the “first stage of the operation” had been “mainly accomplished,” with Ukraine’s combat capabilities “significantly reduced,” and that it would now focus on securing Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, where Russia-backed separatists have been fighting for eight years.

The Defense Ministry statement was ambiguous about further possible Russian territorial ambitions in Ukraine, where its ground forces have been mostly stymied by the unexpectedly strong Ukrainian military response.

But on a day when President Biden was visiting U.S. soldiers in Poland near the Ukrainian border, the statement suggested the possibility that the Russians were looking for a way to salvage some kind of achievement before the costs of the war they launched a month ago became impossibly onerous.

While Russia “does not exclude” that its forces will storm major Ukrainian cities such as Chernihiv, Mykolaiv and the capital, Kyiv, the Defense Ministry statement said that taking them over was not the primary objective.

“As individual units carry out their tasks — and they are being solved successfully — our forces and means will be concentrated on the main thing: the complete liberation of the Donbas,” Col. Gen. Sergei Rudskoi, a senior Russian military commander, said in the statement, his first since Russia’s invasion on Feb. 24.

Whether General Rudskoi’s statement was sincere or simply strategic misdirection was difficult to assess. But the statement amounted to the most direct acknowledgment yet that Russia may be unable to take full control of Ukraine and would instead target the Donbas region, where Russia has recognized the independence of two Kremlin-backed separatist areas that it calls the “Donetsk People’s Republic” and the “Luhansk People’s Republic.”

Russia has also insisted that Ukraine recognize its control of Crimea, which President Vladimir V. Putin’s forces seized from Ukraine in 2014.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has ruled out ceding those regions to stop the war.

Pavel Luzin, a Russian military analyst, cautioned that the public pronouncements of Russian military commanders should be regarded skeptically. While Russia could indeed be narrowing its war aims, he said, General Rudskoi’s statement could also be a feint as Russia regroups for a new offensive.

“We could say that this is a signal that we’re no longer insisting on dismantling Ukrainian statehood,” Mr. Luzin said. “But I would rather see it as a distracting maneuver.”

General Rudskoi’s statement came as Ukraine acknowledged that Russian forces had been “partially successful” in achieving one of their key objectives — securing a land corridor from Russia to the Crimean Peninsula.

While Russia already controlled much of the area, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said the route allowed Russian troops and supplies to flow between Crimea and Russia.

But some Ukrainian officials said the significance of such a route might be overstated. Oleksandr Danylyuk, a former secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine under Mr. Zelensky, described the land bridge as a minor Russian victory and said the Kremlin was moving to secure Donetsk and Luhansk to “sell to the Russian public as a potential victory.”

In Moscow, Mr. Putin, who has made any criticism of the war a potential crime, used a televised videoconference with the winners of a presidential arts prize on Friday to deliver a diatribe about “cancel culture” that made no mention of the war in Ukraine.

In embracing a term that has become a favorite of the American political right to reprise his contention that the West is trying to erase Russian culture and history, Mr. Putin cited J.K. Rowling, author of the “Harry Potter” books, whose comments about transgender women have been criticized as transphobic.

“Not so long ago, the children’s writer J.K. Rowling was also ‘canceled’ for the fact that she — the author of books that have sold hundreds of millions of copies around the world — did not please fans of so-called gender freedoms,” Mr. Putin said.

Ms. Rowling responded on Twitter that, “Critiques of Western cancel culture are possibly not best made by those currently slaughtering civilians for the crime of resistance, or who jail and poison their critics.” She added the hashtag #IStandWithUkraine.

As Mr. Putin spoke, there were indications that Ukrainian forces were making some progress in the second week of their counteroffensive. A senior Pentagon official said that Russian forces no longer had full control of the southern port of Kherson and that the city, the first major urban center to be captured in the Russian invasion, was now “contested territory.”

The Pentagon assessment contradicted General Rudskoi’s claim on Friday that the Kherson region was “under full control.”

In another sign of the bloody stalemate in Ukraine, Russian soldiers have adopted “defensive positions” near Kyiv, the Pentagon official said, adding that Russia appeared to be “prioritizing” the fight in eastern Ukraine, as General Rudskoi had indicated.

“Clearly, they overestimated their ability to take Kyiv and overestimated their ability to take any population center,” the Pentagon official said.

Mr. Biden, on the second day of his three-day visit to Europe because of the Ukraine crisis, traveled to Rzeszow, Poland, about 50 miles from the Ukrainian border, where he met with members of the 82nd Airborne Division who are serving as part of NATO’s efforts to protect Poland and other member states from Russian aggression.

Greeting American service members who were eating pizza in a cafeteria, Mr. Biden called them “the finest fighting force in the history of the world,” and added, “I personally thank you for what you do.”

Later, Mr. Biden met with President Andrzej Duda of Poland and officials managing the humanitarian response to the more than two million Ukrainian refugees who have fled to Poland to escape the shelling and deprivation.

Mr. Biden also announced a deal to increase U.S. shipments of natural gas to help wean Europe off Russian energy. But it remained unclear exactly how the administration would achieve its goals.

The deal calls for the United States to send an additional 15 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas — roughly 10 to 12 percent of current annual U.S. exports to all countries. But it does not address the lack of port capacity to ship and receive more gas on both sides of the Atlantic.

Still, American gas executives welcomed a renewed emphasis on exports as a sign that the Biden administration was now seeking to promote the U.S. oil and gas industry rather than punish it for contributions to climate change.

“I have no idea how they are going to do this, but I don’t want to criticize them because for the first time they are trying to do the right thing,” said Charif Souki, executive chairman of Tellurian, a U.S. gas producer that is planning to build an export terminal in Louisiana.

Robert Habeck, the vice chancellor and economic minister of Germany, said his country expected to halve imports of Russian oil by midsummer and nearly end them by year’s end — sooner than many thought possible. He estimated that Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, could be free of Russian gas by mid-2024.

Images and videos from Ukraine that emerged on Friday underscored the escalating death toll and destruction.

Newly surfaced security camera footage, verified by The New York Times, showed an attack on people in line for emergency aid outside a post office and shopping center in the battered northeastern city of Kharkiv on Thursday. Oleg Sinegubov, the head of the regional government there, said that at least six civilians had been killed and 15 wounded.

Photographs out of Kharkiv on Friday also showed a large fireball and nearby cars and buildings on fire, as residents fled on foot and bicycle, carrying whatever belongings they could grab in the aftermath of the attack.

In the central city of Dnipro, Russian missile strikes on a military facility destroyed buildings late Thursday night, according to Ukrainian officials, who said that casualties were still being assessed.

And in Mariupol, the southern port savaged by Russian attacks, Ukrainian officials said that an estimated 300 people had been killed in a March 16 strike on a theater used as a bomb shelter.

It was unclear how officials had arrived at that estimate. Ukrainian officials have said that about 130 people were rescued from the theater, which was attacked even though “children” had been written in giant letters on the pavement on both sides of the building.

The United Nations said on Friday that more than 1,000 civilians have been killed, including 93 children, since Russia’s invasion began, many in what appeared to have been indiscriminate bombardments that could constitute war crimes.

The United Nations cautioned that it had not been able to verify the death toll in areas of intense conflict, including Mariupol, and said the actual number of injured and dead was likely to be considerably higher.

In a sign that diplomatic efforts were struggling, Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, rejected comments by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, who had suggested that Ukraine was open to concessions in four key areas.

In an interview released Friday, Mr. Erdogan, who is hosting talks between Ukrainian and Russian delegations, said that Ukraine was willing to drop its bid for NATO membership, accept Russian as an official language, make “certain concessions” about disarmament and agree to “collective security.”

But Mr. Kuleba said the negotiations had proved “very difficult” and that Ukraine had “taken a strong position and does not relinquish its demands.”

“We insist, first of all, on a cease-fire, security guarantees and territorial integrity of Ukraine,” he said, adding that there was “no consensus with Russia on the four points mentioned by the president of Turkey.”

“In particular,” he said, “the Ukrainian language is and will be the only one state language in Ukraine.”

Jeff Fortenberry should resign after he was convicted of felonies, & says he plans to speak with the Nebraska Republican today: “When someone’s convicted it’s time to resign.”



He adds that if Fortenberry wants to appeal, can do it that as a private citizen. — Melanie Zanona (@MZanona) March 25, 2022 The Nebraska congressman was convicted in federal court in Los Angeles on Thursday of lying to federal authorities about an illegal contribution to his campaign in 2016 from a Lebanese-Nigerian billionaire. Fortenberry, who is in his ninth term, told reporters at the courthouse that he planned to appeal. McCarthy said that was his right, but suggested he do it as a private citizen, not a member of Congress.



25 Mar 2022 10.27 With Manchin’s support in the bag, attention now turns to senator Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat from Arizona, another centrist holdout on key parts of Biden’s agenda. But so far, the senator has signaled that she intends to support Jackson’s nomination. With Manchin as a yes on Ketanji Brown Jackson's nomination, attention turns to Kyrsten Sinema, but she has sounded very positive about the judge. This is from last week: https://t.co/bvz390fTce — Joan Greve (@joanegreve) March 25, 2022 Despite a brutal confirmation hearing, Democratic leaders remain hopeful Jackson will attract some Republican votes, as she did during her confirmation to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit last year. As long as all 50 Democrats support Jackson, they do not need any Republican votes to confirm her to the bench. The filibuster no longer applies, after minority leader Mitch McConnell and Republicans voted in 2017 to lower the threshold to confirm supreme court nominees from 60 votes to 50 in response to an attempt by Democrats to block the confirmation of judge Neil Gorsuch. It followed a 2013 rule change by Democrats that lowered the threshold from 60 to 50 votes to confirm most presidential nominees, excluding Supreme Court picks, amid a Republican blockade against several nominees of Barack Obama.



25 Mar 2022 10.10 Manchin will vote to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson Senator Joe Manchin, Democrat of West Virginia, said he would vote to confirm Biden’s nominee for the supreme court, Ketanji Brown Jackson, all but ensuring she will be the first Black woman to sit on the bench. “After meeting with Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, considering her record, and closely monitoring her testimony and questioning before the Senate Judiciary Committee this week, I have determined I intend to vote for her nomination to serve on the Supreme Court,” he said, citing the judge’s “exemplary” record and career.

My full statement: pic.twitter.com/SUgwuBtHup — Senator Joe Manchin (@Sen_JoeManchin) March 25, 2022 Though not a complete surprise, it is likely a relief for Democrats in the evenly divided, 50-50 Senate, where they need every vote from their party to confirm Jackson. Manchin, who has blocked major pieces of Biden’s legislative agenda and recently doomed his nominee to the Fed, has largely supported the president’s judicial nominees. “On top of her impressive resume, she has the temperament to make an exceptional jurist,” he said, adding a very Manchian (Manchinian?) detail: “Notably, Judge Jackson and her family spend a great deal of time in West Virginia and her deep love of our state and commitment to public service were abundantly clear.” He concluded: “I am confident Judge Jackson is supremely qualified and has the disposition necessary to serve as our nation’s next Supreme Court Justice.”

25 Mar 2022 09.59 Air Force One has landed at Poland’s Rzeszów-Jasionka Airport, which is in the southeast part of the country, roughly an hour drive from the border with Ukraine. Biden was supposed to meet first with Andrzej Duda, but the Polish president’s plane has been delayed. Polish media is reporting that the plane was forced to return due to a technical issue. A Polish Government 737, en route to Rzeszów, has returned to Warsaw. According to media the Polish president Andrzej Duda was onboard the aircraft that returned because of a technical problem. pic.twitter.com/7LrphWHrdR — Flightradar24 (@flightradar24) March 25, 2022 Instead, Biden will first greet US service-members of the 82nd Airborne Division, who are working alongside Polish allies on deterrence efforts on Nato’s eastern flank, before receiving a briefing by humanitarian groups. According to background provided by the White House, members of the Task Force 82 have completed “combined training, civic, and cultural engagements” since their arrival in Poland last month. That includes “combined arms training” with Polish and British allies as well as civic and cultural visits to local orphanages, youth groups, military memorials and the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp site.

25 Mar 2022 09.34 Sullivan answered questions from reporters a number of topics. Concern that Russia may use chemical weapons was an “important topic of conversation” during Biden’s visit to Europe. Biden vowed to respond “in kind” if Russia uses chemical weapons in Ukraine. Pressed on what that means, as chemical weapons are illegal under international law and Biden has repeatedly said the US would not send troops to fight Russia in Ukraine, Sullivan said it was an issue being discussed and prepared for both militarily and diplomatically as well as among allied leaders. “We are working through contingency planning for a range of different scenarios,” he said. “It is difficult to give precision to these kinds of hypotheticals because of course, the form of use, the location of use, the context of use, all have a bearing on the specificity of the response. But in broad terms, I believe that there is convergence around the fundamental nature of how the alliance would respond to these issues.” He also told reporters that the US does not believe China has granted Russia’s request for military aid. “We have not seen the Chinese move forward with the provision of military equipment to Russia, but it’s something we continue to watch every day,” he said. Asked whether the president expected to discuss a Polish proposal to send international peacekeepers into Ukraine, Sullivan said he wasn’t sure if the Polish president would raise that with Biden during their meeting and said the US needed more information before it responded. He also said there is “no update” on Ukraine’s request for more warplanes, after the US rejected a proposal from Poland to transfer Russian-made MiG fighter planes from a US base in Germany to Ukraine out of concern that it might escalate the conflict with Russia. Asked about how Biden views his trip to Europe, Sullivan emphasized a point Biden stressed in his remarks on Thursday: that unity will take work over time. “Part of the reason that he decided that we needed to do this is because the early weeks unity can be carried forward by momentum and inertia and adrenaline,” Sullivan said. “But this could go on for some time, and to sustain that unity as costs rise, as the tragedy unfolds, that’s hard work. And the president wanted to get everybody together to say, ‘we’ve got to do that work.’ ...It takes an American president coming over to really try to drive this forward.”
