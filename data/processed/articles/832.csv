Explosions and gunfire erupted in a northern district of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on Friday, an AFP reporter on the ground heard, as invading Russian forces closed in.

Pedestrians ran for safety and small arms fire and explosions were heard in the Obolonsky area. The larger blasts could be heard as far away as the city centre.

Russian forces first arrived on the outskirts of Kyiv on Thursday when helicopter-borne troops assaulted an airfield just outside the city, close to Obolonsky.

The Ukrainian military claims to have repulsed the attack on the Gostomel airbase, but Russian ground forces have also been pushing down the west bank of the Dnieper river from Belarus.

As they arrived in Obolonsky, within the city, the Ministry of Defence's Facebook page urged civilians to resist.

""We urge citizens to inform us of troop movements, to make Molotov cocktails, and neutralise the enemy,"" it said.

(CNN) — Explosions have been seen and heard in parts of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, as the fight by Ukrainian forces to hold back a Russian advance on the capital intensifies in the early hours of Saturday morning, amid warnings the city could fall within days and as officials handed out weapons to reservists.

“This night will be very difficult, and the enemy will use all available forces to break the resistance of Ukrainians,” President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a late-night video message Friday. “This night we have to stand ground. The fate of Ukraine is being decided right now.”

Earlier Saturday, videos from eyewitnesses showed explosions taking place in an area north-west of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. There is a military base in the area.

CNN teams in the capital also reported hearing loud explosions to the west and south of the city Saturday. Shortly afterward, Ukraine’s State Service of Special Communications said clashes are underway in an eastern suburb as well — as Russian forces close in on the capital from multiple sides.

Meanwhile, the Ukrainian armed forces reported heavy fighting around the city of Vasylkiv, some 30 kilometers southwest of Kyiv.

“Heavy fighting is currently underway in the town of Vasylkiv in the Kyiv region, where the occupiers are trying to land a landing party,” the armed forces said.

Russian forces are close to Kyiv, Zelensky confirmed in his message Friday, advancing on the capital from the north and east after seizing control Thursday of an airbase just north of the city. But “Ukrainians resist the Russian aggression heroically,” he said.

Russia’s military claimed earlier Friday its forces had staged a “successful landing operation” to capture Hostomel airfield, viewed as strategically important, on Kyiv’s outskirts.

Zelensky’s comments came hours after a video was posted on his Facebook page, showing him with a group of men, saying, “We are here. We are in Kyiv. We are defending Ukraine.”

Before dawn Friday, explosions lit up the sky above the capital as Russia targeted the city with missile strikes, according to a Ukrainian government adviser. A CNN team reported hearing two large blasts in central Kyiv and a third loud explosion in the distance, followed by at least three more explosions to the south-west of the city a few hours later.

“Strikes on Kyiv with cruise or ballistic missiles continued,” Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to the Head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine told reporters via text message Friday.

Meanwhile, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said Russian reconnaissance troops had entered the Obolon district of northern Kyiv, just a few miles from the city center. Videos from the area showed chaotic scenes as civilians tried to hide from small arms fire.

A tweet from the ministry asked citizens of the district to report any suspicious movements, adding: “Make Molotov cocktails and take down the occupier.”

CNN witnessed a group of Ukrainian security forces leave the city police headquarters with weapons and ammunition — apparently heading towards Obolon.

Meanwhile, 92 people working at the Chernobyl power plant, the site of the world’s worst-ever nuclear disaster, have been taken hostage, the Ukrainian ambassador to the US said Friday. Russian forces took control of the site on Thursday, sparking fears that the fighting could interfere with the operation of nuclear waste facilities.

As Russian troops advance, US intelligence officials are concerned that Kyiv could fall under Russian control within days, according to two sources familiar with the latest intelligence.

However, the latest British defense intelligence assessment said Russia had made “limited progress” Friday in its attack.

“Fighting continues in key locations. Russia has made limited progress so far today and Ukraine retains control of key cities. Ukrainian MOD reports that Russian forces have arrived in the suburbs of Kyiv,” the UK Ministry of Defence tweeted.

A senior US defense official told reporters that the Russians have “about a third of their combat power” in Ukraine out of the total combat power they have amassed on the country’s borders right now, but “that does not mean that they will not commit more.”

The Ukrainian Defense Ministry earlier said that airborne assault troops blew up a bridge over the Teteriv River at Ivankiv, about 30 miles north of Kyiv, successfully preventing a Russian column of forces from advancing towards the capital, which has a population of close to 3 million.

For now, Ukraine’s democratically elected government remains intact but President Volodymr Zelensky warned in a video address late Thursday that “enemy sabotage groups” had entered this city and he is their No. 1 target. “They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state,” he said.

“Russian forces continued to launch missile strikes on the territory of Ukraine. They say that they are only targeting military facilities, but these are lies. In fact, they do not distinguish in which areas they operate,” he said. “Such attacks on our capital haven’t occurred since 1941.”

In an address Friday morning, Zelensky said Ukrainians were “showing their true heroism” but that they were defending their country “alone.” The sanctions imposed on Russia by Western powers are “not enough to get these foreign troops off our soil,” he said.

A few hours later, Zelensky released a message in which he again called for Russian President Vladimir Putin to hold direct talks. “There is fighting all over Ukraine now. Let’s sit down at the negotiation table to stop the people’s deaths,” he said, speaking in Russian.

Shortly afterward, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was ready to send a delegation to Minsk, the capital of Belarus, for talks with Ukraine, Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti reported.

“As you know, today the President of Ukraine Zelensky announced his readiness to discuss the neutral status of Ukraine,” Peskov said, according to RIA. The talks would concern “neutral status,” he suggested. Peskov said later Friday that the Ukrainian side had countered with a proposal to meet in Warsaw and then dropped contact.

Zelensky has not directly proposed neutral status but has signaled a willingness to discuss it, while insisting his country be provided security guarantees.

“Ukraine has been and remains ready to talk about a ceasefire and peace. This is our constant position,” Sergii Nykyforov, a spokesperson for Zelensky, said late Friday. He also denied what he called “claims that we have refused to negotiate.”

Meanwhile, Putin called on Ukraine’s armed forces to overthrow their government in remarks to his security council Friday.

“Do not let Banderites (Ukrainian nationalists) and neo-Nazis use your children, wives and old people as human shields,” Putin said in remarks aired on Russian state television. “Take power into your own hands, it looks like it will be easier for us to come to an agreement than with this gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis that has settled in Kyiv and taken hostage the entire Ukrainian people.”

Putin frequently repeats the baseless and inaccurate claim that the democratically elected Ukrainian government is a “Nazi” or “fascist” regime. The language has been roundly condemned internationally, especially considering that Zelensky is Jewish.

Asked by CNN at a news conference Friday what Moscow’s plans were for the leadership of Ukraine as Russian forces advance on Kyiv, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov replied: “Nobody is going to attack the people of Ukraine.”

In an interview with CNN on the streets of Kyiv, former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko accused Putin of being “simply crazy” in wanting to “come here to kill Ukrainians” — and vowed they would resist. “We demonstrate a unique quality that we can stand against Russian aggression,” he said.

Homes damaged

The advance on Kyiv comes only a day after Russian forces entered Ukraine from three sides, by land, sea and air, prompting a barrage of international condemnation and sanctions — and questions about Putin’s wider ambitions for the country and its capital.

It’s unclear how long Ukrainian forces can resist the advance of Russian forces who are much better equipped and have superior air power.

Two residential buildings in Kyiv suffered damage in the early hours of Friday, but it’s not clear if they were intentionally struck or hit by debris, or if anyone was injured.

Ukrainian Deputy Interior Minister Evgeny Yenin told CNN a Ukrainian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jet was shot down over Kyiv. Photos tweeted by the emergency forces appear to show a fire at a two-story private house with debris from what looks to be a plane nearby. It is unclear if the house was hit by remnants of the jet.

Separately, images showed firefighters working to put out a blaze at an apartment building on the left bank of the city.

As they approach, many Ukrainians are preparing to fight back. Some 18,000 guns with ammunition have been distributed to reservists in the Kyiv region alone since the Russian invasion began early Thursday, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said, with more weapons on their way.

Outside the Kyiv region, fighting continued in cities including Sumy, in the northeast, Chernihiv in the north and Kherson to the south.

A CNN team that visited a bridge crossing from Russian-held areas into the southern city of Kherson saw four large shell craters, 10 discarded Ukrainian armored vehicles and several bodies, but the Ukrainians appeared to have been able to push Russian forces back.

Low-flying jets could be seen overhead and air raid sirens wailed across the city.

A Russian defense ministry spokesperson said in a statement that a “counter-offensive” was underway in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, and that Ukrainian service members had surrendered to Russian troops and pro-Russian separatists. CNN could not immediately check the veracity of those claims.

Makeshift bunkers

Officials in the country believe Russia’s plan is to overthrow the Ukrainian leadership and install a pro-Russian government.

Those fears were shared with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, who said Thursday that he’s “convinced” Moscow is going to try to overthrow the Ukrainian government.

If that happens, Blinken said he believes “Moscow has developed plans to inflict widespread human rights abuses — and potentially worse — on the Ukrainian people.”

The fighting in Ukraine appears to be some of the worst conventional warfare Europe has seen since World War II and the conflicts in the Balkans in the 1990s. Preliminary figures indicate 137 Ukrainian solders have been killed, including every soldier defending an island in the Black Sea that was taken over by Russian troops, according to President Zelensky.

The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said its armed forces had caused around 800 casualties among Russian forces since the attacks started early on Thursday. It was not immediately clear whether the ministry was referring solely to the number killed and CNN is not able to independently verify Ukraine’s figures.

By the end of Thursday, Putin’s forces had launched “in total more than 160 missiles for airstrikes,” a senior US defense official said, prompting a response reminiscent of the late 1930s, with vulnerable children evacuated by train from eastern Ukraine and packed subway stations turned into makeshift bunkers as air raid sirens wailed.

In an ominous sign a ground war could escalate, Zelensky barred male citizens between the ages of 18 and 60 from leaving the country, according to the State Border Guard Service.

Zelensky also ordered a general military mobilization “in order to ensure the defense of the state, maintaining combat and mobilization readiness of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other military formations, in a declaration signed late Thursday.

More than 100,000 people have already fled areas most at risk of attack within Ukraine, according to the United Nations refugee agency. The mass movement followed warnings from the US Ambassador to the UN, who said Russia’s actions in Ukraine could create one of the largest refugee crises facing the world today, displacing as many as five million people.

Polish officials reported an increase in the number of people crossing into the country from Ukraine in the hours after the Russian invasion began.

Sanctioning Putin

The United States will impose sanctions on Putin and Lavrov, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Friday, hours after the European Union and United Kingdom said they would do the same.

The EU also announced a slew of other new sanctions on Russia, designed to have “maximum impact on the Russian economy and political elite.”

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the sanctions would hit Russia’s financial, energy and transport sectors, visa policy, and include export controls and export financing bans.

“We want to financially isolate Russia, we want to cut all the ties between Russia and the international financial system,” said French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire.

Speaking in Brussels on Thursday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg described Russia’s attack on Ukraine as a “brutal act of war.”

The alliance activated the NATO Response Force (NRF) for the first time ever in response to the invasion. The NRF is made up of land, air, sea and special operations forces from the allies that can deploy quickly in support of the NATO alliance.

“We have over 100 jets at high alert, operating in over 30 different locations, and over 120 ships from the high north, to the Mediterranean. We activated the defense plans yesterday, and now elements of this force are being deployed,” Stoltenberg said during a press briefing on Friday, following an extraordinary meeting of NATO Heads of State and Government in Brussels. He also clarified that while the United States, Canada and European allies have “deployed thousands more troops” to the eastern part of the alliance, NATO is not deploying the entire Response Force.

A big concern for NATO is whether Putin’s intentions lie beyond Ukraine, a prospect that risks drawing all 30 members — including the US, the United Kingdom, Canada, France and Germany — into a wider conflict on European soil.

“You don’t need intelligence to tell you that that’s exactly what President Putin wants. He has made clear he’d like to reconstitute the Soviet Empire, short of that he’d like to reassert a sphere of influence around the neighboring countries that were once part of the Soviet bloc,” said Blinken on CBS Evening News.

Blinken said NATO would stand in the way if those were Putin’s ultimate goals.

“Now, when it comes to a threat beyond Ukraine’s borders. There’s something very powerful standing in his way. That’s article five of NATO, an attack on one is an attack on all,” the top diplomat said.

On Thursday, the US Secretary of Defense ordered the deployment of 7,000 US service members to Europe. The deployment brings the number of US troops moved towards eastern Europe at more than 14,000.",https://kslnewsradio.com/1964733/battle-for-ukrainian-capital-underway-as-explosions-seen-and-heard-in-kyiv/

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine posted a video on Twitter, telling the public not to believe false reports.

He was alive. Kyiv had not fallen. Any reports of Ukraine laying down its arms was a lie, Mr. Zelensky said.

“I’m here,” he said. “We are not putting down any arms. We will protect our country, because our weapons are our truth. The truth is that this is our land, our country, our children, and we will protect them all.”

“That is it. That’s what I wanted to tell you. Glory to Ukraine.”

His comments, released before 9 a.m., came as fighting intensified in Kyiv. What until three days ago had been a thriving European metropolis has been transformed into a battle zone. Russian troops pressed in from all directions.

There was intense street fighting, and bursts of gunfire and explosions could be heard across the city, including its heart, Maidan square, where in 2014 Ukrainian protests led to the toppling of a pro-Moscow government.

The Russian military has a decisive edge in cyberwarfare, tanks, heavy weaponry, missiles, fighter planes and warships. In sheer numbers, its military dwarfs that of Ukraine.

Russia has established attack lines into three cities — Kyiv in the north, Kharkiv in the northeast and Kherson in the south — and Ukrainian troops are fighting to hold all three. The Pentagon reported late Friday that the Russians did not appear to be in control of a single major population center. Significantly, a senior U.S. defense official said, Ukrainian command and control remains intact.

The Ukrainian government reported that hundreds of Russian soldiers had been killed in the war, along with scores of their own soldiers, while the Russian defense ministry issued a statement on Saturday morning that made no mention of any casualties or anything about the fight for Kyiv.

The Russian invasion started with targeted airstrikes before dawn on Thursday, but on the third day of the war, bloody battles were often being waged in close quarters. Ukrainska Pravda, a Ukrainian news site, citing witnesses, reported combat 400 yards from Maidan Square in central Kyiv.

All Ukrainian men of fighting are being drafted into service, and tens of thousands are signing up. Ukrainians were asked to make Molotov cocktails. And there were tearful scenes at airports in western Ukraine as wives kissed their husbands goodbye before they headed to front.

The nation has rallied around its president, Mr. Zelensky, a former comedian.

To him and other officials, the objective of the Russian invasion of a neighboring country that possessed no military threat is to topple the government.

Mr. Zelensky has said that he is “target no. 1.”

As battles were waged around the city on Saturday morning, there were reports of clashes near the city’s train station and along a central thoroughfare, Bohdan Khmelnitsky Street, leading from Victory Square toward the city center, according to the witness accounts. Along that street, closer to the city center, bursts of gunfire could be heard through the night.

“We are stopping the horde, so far as we can,” the secretary of the Ukrainian Security and Defense Council, Oleksy Danilov, said around 7 a.m. “The situation is under control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and citizens of Kyiv.”

In dozens of interviews in the tense hours before the invasion and in the days after, Ukrainians struggled to understand how a country at peace so suddenly found itself at war. For many Ukrainians, the answer was found in Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin.

This is Mr. Putin’s war. But what frightened people perhaps as much as the threat of missiles and bombs was that they did not know what he wanted.

The fear was evident in the drive from Kyiv to a small village outside the city. Military convoys had replaced families going on vacation or visiting friends. Where once Kyiv was known as a city where the music played a touch too loud in its cafes, the incessant wail of air raid sirens drowned out all joy.

The fear was evident in the faces of the people seeking safety in Western Ukraine, after they emerged from 20-hour train rides in packed carriages that were kept pitch-black to avoid being targeting by Russian rockets.

From Lviv in the west to Odessa in the south and Kharkiv and nearly all points in between, people huddled in air raid shelters and lined up and bank machines and stocked up on essentials.

The city was braced for battle heading into the weekends as Russian troops continued to advance and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had issued a desperate plea for help.

“The fate of Ukraine is being decided now,” Zelenskyy said in an address on social media. “Special attention is on Kyiv — we should not lose the capital. The enemy will use all the possible forces they have to break our resistance. They will be mean and hard. Tonight they will begin a full scale storm.”

Russian troops bore down on the city as the global backlash mounted against the unprovoked attack on a European democracy.

Explosions, air raid sirens and the sound of gunfire filled the air over Kyiv on Friday. Officials in Kyiv urged citizens to take shelter and street fighting was occurring. Explosions were heard overnight, and video showed fighting near the Kyiv Zoo.

In the morning, Zelenskyy posted a video standing in front of what appeared to be a building next to the presidential office in Kyiv. “I’m here,” he said.

Zelenskyy denied what he said were false claims of an evacuation. “We won’t put down [our] weapon, we’ll protect our country,” he said in the video, according to an NBC News translation.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said Saturday said that Russian troops trying to enter the city have been beaten back, but other sabotage and reconnaissance groups were inside.

“The night was difficult, but there are no Russian troops in the capital,” Klitschko said in a Telegram message Saturday morning, according to an NBC News translation. “The enemy is trying to break into the city.”

As of 6 a.m. 35 people had been injured, including two children, he said.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Friday that “no strikes are being made on civilian infrastructure,” The Washington Post reported. And the Russian Ministry of Defence said Friday that it was doing all it could to avoid civilian casualties.

Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, said on Twitter on Saturday morning that Kyiv ""survived another night under attacks by Russian ground forces, missiles,"" and one hit a residential apartment. NBC News has not independently verified that allegation.

Photos of the building showed heavy damage to several floors with walls and windows blown out and a fire burning inside. The fire was extinguished and the building was being evacuated, according to the State Emergency Service of Ukraine.

Information on injuries was not immediately available early Saturday.

The Ukrainian military said in a Facebook post that Russian troops attacked an army base in Kyiv around midnight on Saturday but were repelled. The military also said there were ""heavy battles"" in Vasylkiv, a city near the capital. NBC News was not able to independently verify the Ukrainian military's accounts.

The mayor of Vasylkiv said Russian paratroopers landed but were repulsed. NBC News has not independently verified that claim.

There is fighting on the outskirts of the capital of Kyiv and in the coastal city of Mariupol, but presidential adviser Mykhailo Podoliak said the situation was under control.

“We knew that tonight was going to be a difficult night,” Podoliak said, adding that Russian attempts to harm Ukrainian cities “didn’t work.”

On Friday, the United States and European Union took the rare step of imposing sanctions on a head of state by targeting Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Biden administration also slapped sanctions on Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and other members of Russia’s Security Council.

Zelenskyy spoke by phone with President Joe Biden for roughly 40 minutes on Friday, the White House said. Ukraine’s leader tweeted that the two discussed “strengthening sanctions, concrete defense assistance and an anti-war coalition.”

At the United Nations, a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Russia's military aggression was vetoed — by Russia. The council voted 11-1 Friday in favor of the resolution, and Russia was the lone vote against it. Three countries abstained.

Putin suggested he might be willing to enter negotiations with Ukraine even as his forces continued their advance across the country. But hours later, the Russian leader urged Ukrainian soldiers to overthrow their government, which he described a ""gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis"" — repeating propaganda Russia uses to justify its actions.

But hours later, the Russian leader urged Ukrainian soldiers to overthrow their government, which he described a “gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis” — repeating propaganda Russia uses to justify its actions.

Inside the embattled capital, Zelenskyy refused to leave and instead made a desperate plea for Western governments to take tougher measures against Moscow.

He has already called up any Ukrainians willing to fight and handed out thousands of guns to civilians. And on Friday, Zelenskyy urged anyone with military experience in Europe to travel to Ukraine and help defend its independence or take to their own streets in protest.

“We are defending our independence, our country,” he said in his latest video message. ""It will continue like this. Glory to our defenders, glory to Ukraine.”

The fresh plea from the Ukrainian leader came as the invading Russian troops bore down on Kyiv amid a desperate defense in which hundreds of troops on either side were reportedly killed.

Oksana Markarova, the Ukrainian ambassador to the U.S., said at a news conference Friday that Russia committed what she characterized as war crimes, targeting civilians, taking nearly 100 people hostage at Chernobyl and striking an orphanage with 50 children inside.

""The Russian propaganda machine says that civilians were not targeted. I want to tell you this is not true,"" Markarova told reporters.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko described Russia's offensive in stark terms.

“The enemy wants to put the capital on its knees and destroy us,"" said Klitschko, a former world heavyweight boxing champion. “The city has gone into a defensive phase. Shots and explosions are ringing out in some neighborhoods. Saboteurs have already entered Kyiv.”

Russia is nonetheless meeting “greater resistance” from the Ukrainians than it might have expected, a senior U.S. defense official said Friday.

“They are fighting for their country,” the official said, referring to Ukrainian troops and freedom fighters.

The official said Russian forces are undertaking an amphibious assault to the west of the city of Mariupol, and the United States has indications Russia is placing potentially thousands of naval forces ashore there. American officials assume Russian troops will then attempt to move toward the Donbas region, the official added.

Local officials warned residents in Obolon, a district north of the capital, not to go outside early Friday due to ""the approach of active hostilities."" The military said Russian saboteurs — troops disguised in Ukrainian uniforms — were in the streets.

Meanwhile just outside the capital, Russia claimed it had taken control of the strategic Hostomel Airport, which handles heavy cargo flights and would allow Moscow to airlift troops directly to Kyiv. A day earlier, Ukraine's military said that Russian troops sustained heavy casualties in the fighting there.

NBC News has not verified either side's reports.

Local officials said that Russia had captured the southern city of Kherson despite its “significant forces” suffering “great loses.”

In the northeastern city of Kharkiv, NBC News correspondent Matt Bradley reported around noon local time Friday that car alarms went off across the city as loud, sustained bombardments drew closer.

“Up until now, we understood Russian troops had set up around the ring road of the city. Now we understand they are moving in,” he said from an underground parking garage filled with journalists and local residents, including children.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-invasion-kyiv-attack-putin-advance-zelenskyy-rcna17660

People in Kyiv were told to make Molotov cocktail petrol bombs on Friday as they hid in makeshift shelters and basements, awaiting a Russian assault on the Ukrainian capital.

Missiles pounded Kyiv overnight and air raid sirens wailed, increasing fears among residents who did not flee the city of 3 million on Thursday that an assault was imminent.

“Make Molotov cocktails, neutralise the occupier!,” the Defence Ministry said, while local authorities told people in the north-western Obolon area of the city to stay off the streets because “active hostilities” were approaching.

Some residents took refuge in subway stations being used as air-raid shelters, or rushed to basements of apartment blocks or other buildings when air-raid warnings sounded.

“The kids were scared, they cry and ask ‘Mom, will we all die?’”, said Alla, a woman in her 40s.

The basement where she took cover was packed with hundreds of people with no place to sleep, only chairs and some water.

Even finding a place to sit was difficult.

“We don’t know how long we have to stay here. Good we have chairs at least,” a 35-year-old woman who gave her name only as Viktoria said, while her children of five and seven slept without taking off their winter coats.

“We’re shocked, we didn’t expect that. How can you wage a war against peaceful people?” she said.

Ukrainian leaders evoked memories of a Nazi German attack on Kyiv in 1941. Damage to the centuries-old city during World War Two took years to repair.

One resident of southeast Kyiv, who gave his name only as Sergei, said he woke at around 4 a.m. and went out to the balcony of his apartment for a smoke.

He heard an explosion and saw a flash in the skies in front of him. Five seconds later an explosion shook his 10-storey residential building, not far from Boryspil international airport.

“Glass flew all around. There’s now a shell fragment in my kitchen. I was shocked,” he told Reuters. Nobody in his family was hurt.

A Reuters reporter saw a 2-metre-deep crater full of rubble in the ground next to the building and windows had been shattered. A policeman on the scene said nobody was killed but several people were badly hurt.

One resident, Oxana Gulenko, a military medic whose father fought for the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, said she was thrown from her bed by the explosion.

“How we can live through it in our time? What should we think? (Russian President Vladimir) Putin should be burnt in hell along with his whole family,” she said, cleaning away broken glass in her apartment.

Others cleared away rubble in the street.

Anatoliy Marchenko, 57, who served in the Soviet army, will have to repair his balcony after the strike and could not find his cat, which ran away during shelling.

“I’m ashamed that I speak Russian,” he said and switched to Ukrainian. “I know people there (in Russia), they are my friends. What do they need from me? A war has come to my house and that’s it.”

KYIV, Ukraine — As sirens blared in the streets of Kyiv, signaling that residents should head to underground bunkers, Washington Post journalists headed to their hotel’s basement where staff and their families were also sheltering. There, hotel workers served up heaping plates of spaghetti bolognese and Greek salad — a welcome surprise considering the restaurant is closed and supplies are dwindling.

With a shortage of plates, some guests shared, and others took turns waiting for plates or silverware to be washed. One man handed out pieces of carpet for guests to put over the cold tile floor. The elderly and children have been given priority for seating. Afterward, a jovial hotel staffer walked around mopping up spilled sauce and lettuce.

The shared sense of camaraderie in the basement bunker was a glimmer of light in an otherwise dark time.

Kyiv

Russian forces entered the outskirts of Kyiv on Friday and were threatening the Ukrainian capital from the north-west and east in a lightning attack apparently aimed at seizing the city.

Late on Friday witnesses reported hearing artillery rounds and intense gunfire from the western part of Kyiv, as president Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned his citizens: “This night will be the hardest... We must withstand. The night will be very hard, but sunset will come.”

He added: “We can’t lose the capital.”

The defence ministry in Moscow claimed its forces had taken control of the strategic Hostomel airfield to the north-west after a day of fighting, although Western sources said they did not believe the airport was usable.

A jittery mood also contributed to confusion: what were thought to be a Russian tank were filmed by locals in the Obolonskyi district about six miles north of the city centre in the morning – although one expert said it was probably a Ukranian Strela-10 air defence system.

Nevertheless such was the nervousness, Kyiv authorities earlier warned locals in Obolonskyi to stay off the streets because “active hostilities” were approaching . Residents were urged to “make molotov cocktails”. The defence ministry also said it had distributed 18,000 assault rifles in the capital.

Gunfire could be also heard close to St Sophia Cathedral, reporters said, creating an increasingly tense atmosphere in the capital, which many expected would have been better defended given its obvious strategic significance.

Intense gunfire broke out on a bridge across the Dnieper River dividing eastern and western Kyiv, with about 200 Ukrainian forces taking defensive positions and sheltering behind their armoured vehicles and under the bridge. Another key bridge leading to the capital was blown away, with smoke rising from it.

Konrad Muzyka, the president of Rochan Consulting, said the “situation does look dire at the moment” particularly regarding Kyiv. “It appears that the main goal is to take Kyiv, break the C2 [command and control], and ‘decapitate’ the political leadership.”

Russian forces have been trying to advance through the north-western suburbs around Vorzel, Buch and Irpen. In the early afternoon, Russia claimed it had control of the capital from the west.

During the fighting, Ukrainian officials claimed that a kindergarten in Vorzel where 50 children were sheltering was hit by Russian fire, although without inflicting any casualties.

Ukraine’s military also warned that a group of Russian spies and saboteurs was seen in a district about 3 miles (5km) north of the city centre. Video posted online by an interior ministry adviser apparently showed dead Russian saboteurs who had captured Ukrainian military vehicles and switched uniforms.

Windows were blasted out of a 10-storey apartment block near Kyiv’s main airport, where a 2-metre crater filled with rubble showed where a shell had struck before dawn. A police officer said people were injured there but not killed.

Approach to Kyiv

Pressure was also intensifying around Chernihiv, about 90 miles north-east of Kyiv, Ukraine’s military said. Russian forces are trying to bypass the city, where there had been fighting, and head down the E95 road to Kozelec and ultimately Kyiv’s eastern suburbs.

Farther east, about 125 miles from the capital, Ukraine’s military admitted on Friday morning that the city of Konotop had been lost to Russian forces. Boryspil, the capital’s main civilian airport, lies to the east of the capital.

The speed of the Russian advance, despite the best efforts of Ukraine’s military, caught many by surprise as Russian military forces converged on Kyiv from the north, east and west. But British defence intelligence said it believed the majority of Russian forces aiming for Kyiv were over 50km away.

Mariupol and the Donbas

The US department of defence said that Russia had launched an amphibious landing with thousands of naval infantry to the west of the key southern coastal city of Mariupol.

“It certainly appears to us to be a piece of their designs in the south to further cut off the Donbas region and to – from a southern perspective – continue to try to take population centres,” said John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary.

Kirby said that the US did not have “perfect visibility” on the attack, but video posted on social media earlier appeared to show a column of Russian armoured vehicles, including T-72B3 tanks and BMP-3 armoured vehicles, moving through the coastal town of Prymorsk which is located between Melitopol and Mariupol.

Describing the “amphibious assault” under way from the Sea of Azov a senior US defence official told reporters that Russians are “putting potentially thousands of naval infantry ashore there … The general assumption is they are going to move towards the north-east, towards Mariupol and the Donbas region.”

Several social media accounts in the region showed images and accounts of volleys of Russian Grad missiles hitting targets near Mariupol late on Friday afternoon.

The aim of the landing would appear to be to allow Russian marines to link up with forces farther east in the Donbas region, where Ukraine’s forces were believed to be holding firm.

Video circulated showing large numbers of what appeared to be Russian Spetsnaz special forces massing outside a Ukrainian SBU intelligence building in Melitopol.

Fighting was reported to be continuing around Kherson on the Dnieper River.

Rest of the country

In Sumy, the main city in the eastern Sumy region, 125 miles from the Russian border, Russian forces were in control of the city, with residents saying that armour was visible patrolling in the streets.

South-east of Sumy the city of Kharkiv, which has a population of more than 1 million, is gradually being surrounded. There were reports of artillery fire and shelling in and around the city.

A resident in the southern Black Sea port of Odesa said that while there had been Russian strikes in the south of the city the north remained calm. It appears not to be an early target.

Casualties

Ukraine said that it had killed 1,000 Russian soldiers on Friday alone – and eliminated up to 80 tanks, 7 helicopters and 10 planes. Moscow has given no casualty count. UN officials reported 25 civilian deaths, mostly from shelling and airstrikes, and said that 100,000 people were believed to have left their homes. The death toll or the figures could not be independently verified.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/fight-for-kyiv-russian-forces-ukraine-capital-war
