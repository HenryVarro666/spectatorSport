Russia won't stop? There's nothing Russia can do. Ukraine IS stopping Russia, despite what you seem to have going on in your head.



There won't be a compromise. Given how things are going, Russia will be tossed out of Ukraine within 2022 and that'll be that. No compromise. No negotiations. No relations. How the fuck do people like you come here and seriously think Russia has a natural right to demand anything? What the fuck is wrong with you? If that was the case, how about Germany sends Russia a note ""Hey um, so everything West of the Ural is now ours, thanks mkay?"" and somehow in your twisted logic Russia should comply? Lmao... you're insane.

Nothing, the border will be guarded and given the direction Ukraine is going, it'll be guarded by NATO forces by the time Russia recovers from this shitshow. Same as the Finnish border. And that'll put an end to all of that bullshit.

A warehouse with ammunition of the Russian occupiers was blown up in Donetsk region.

About this informs Command of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

“Novomayorske, Donetsk region. The warehouse with ammunition of the Russian occupiers was blown up,” the statement reads.

As the General Staff reported in the morning, Russian troops tried to break through the defenses of the Armed Forces near Izium and establish control over Mariupol.

Also occupiers try to improve tactical position of the divisions in the Nikolaev direction.

Russia’s war against Ukraine

Russia invaded on the territory of Ukraine on the morning of February 24, accompanying the offensive by air strikes on military facilities.

After unsuccessful attempts to capture the capital, the aggressor’s troops focused on the terror of the local population. Cases of shootings, rapes, harassment and torture have been reported in a number of towns and villages temporarily occupied by the occupiers.

At the end of March, enemy forces defeated by Ukrainian defenders were forced to leave Kyiv and Chernihiv oblasts. Currently, both regions have been cleared of the Russian army.

The Russian command is regrouping troops to advance from the east. Intelligence believes that Russia will try to capture Mariupol and move further south.

Thus offensive around Donbass, according to the adviser to the head of OP Alexey Arestovich, has already begun.
