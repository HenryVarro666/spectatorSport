As it became known to Svaboda, the Belarusian medics signed a non-disclosure agreement (note - not your regular NDA, many years in jail if breached). Some doctors were threatened with termination.

On March 3, Svaboda sources reported that the morgues in Mazyr and Gomel were ""overcrowded"" with Russian corpses. In Mazyr last week they were immediately loaded into trains of the Russian railway.

“There were unrealistically many corpses! The people who were at the Mozyr station were shocked by the number of corpses loaded on the train. People started shooting videos, but the military caught up with them and ordered them to remove the videos. In the village of Kamenka near Mozyr the cemetery was cordoned off, nobody was allowed there, guards were posted. Maybe they started burying Russians there. Especially near Kamenka - Bokov, there is an airfield and a large russian camp""- a Mozyr resident says.

Another Svaboda source says that the hospital in Mazyr is still overcrowded with wounded russian soldiers. Absolutely all doctors, even narrow specialists, work with the wounded Russians. Meanwhile, locals can't even do X-rays there and they are sent to a children's hospital.

Residents of Gomel also say that buses (with wounded Russians) and ""Ural"" trucks (with KIA) - a common sight in the regional center.

Wounded Russians have been received at the Gomel Center of Radiation Medicine since the beginning of this war. Russian doctors came there and occupied several floors. The wounded are being taken to the Kostyukovka hospital, the ambulance hospital and the regional clinical hospital.

On March 12, BT (note - main Belarusian propaganda channel) aired a story in which reporters called the corpses of Russian soldiers in the Mozyr morgue fake news.

Alexander Lukashenko claimed that about 160-170 Russians wounded in battles with Ukrainians were treated in Belarus. ""We have treated and will continue to treat these children - in Gomel, Mozyr and, in my opinion, some district center,"" - Lukashenko said.
