On Sunday, fierce clashes took place between Russian and Ukrainian forces in Kharkiv. Russian soldiers and armoured vehicles rolled into the city, in northeast Ukraine, and witnesses reported hearing firing and explosions. But city authorities said the attack had been repelled.

The city’s regional governor Oleh Sinegubov said: “Control over Kharkiv is completely ours. The armed forces, the police and the defence forces are working, and the city is being completely cleansed of the enemy.”

Ukraine‘s health ministry said on Sunday that 352 civilians, including 14 children, had been killed since the beginning of the conflict.

From his post in Kyiv, Europe Editor James Mates has the latest on the Russian invasion of Ukraine

President Vladimir Putin has ordered Russian nuclear deterrent forces be put on high alert, as tensions with the West mount over his invasion of Ukraine.

Speaking at a meeting with his top officials, the Russian president claimed leading NATO powers had made “aggressive statements” as well as imposing hard-hitting financial sanctions against Russia and leading officials.

Putin ordered the Russian defense minister and the chief of the military’s General Staff to put the nuclear deterrent forces in a “special regime of combat duty.”

“Western countries aren’t only taking unfriendly actions against our country in the economic sphere, but top officials from leading NATO members made aggressive statements regarding our country,"" Putin said in televised comments.

The order raises the threat Russia's invasion of Ukraine could lead to the use of nuclear weapons.

Prior to the invasion four days ago, Russia's strategic nuclear forces held exercises overseen by Putin.

The drills saw missiles launched from ships, planes, and submarines, as the Russian President watched on from a situation room in the Kremlin alongside Belarus's leader, Alexander Lukashenko.

Listen to the ITV News podcast What You Need To Know, for the latest expert analysis on Ukraine

Russia maintains around 6,000 nuclear warheads, the most of any country in the world. NATO members France, the UK, and the US are also nuclear armed.

On Sunday evening, Boris Johnson said President Putin putting Russia’s nuclear deterrent forces on high alert was “a distraction from the reality of what’s going on in Ukraine”.

The prime minister said Mr Putin's actions were linked the fact that his forces were meeting with “more resistance than the Kremlin had bargained for”. Mr Johnson also cast doubt on negotiations between Russian and Ukrainian delegations to try to resolve the crisis.

The Russian leader this week threatened to retaliate harshly against any nations that intervened directly in the conflict in Ukraine.

Currently no NATO troops are on the ground in Ukraine, but the alliance is sending support through weapons and aid to the country.

Analysis from Neil Connery, ITV News Correspondent, Moscow

President Putin was determined to get the world to pay attention this afternoon when he announced he was putting Russia’s strategic nuclear forces on special alert.

After the strength of the international community’s response over the past 48 hours with sanctions and other measures, it maybe the case that he is wondering whether he has incorrectly gambled with his Ukraine invasion.

Many had expected Russian forces to move much quicker than they are and have underestimated the potency of the Ukrainian resistance.

So as Russia’s president sits in the Kremlin contemplating a potentially collapsing Russian economy and the Russian Ruble going through the floor when the markets open tomorrow, he turned to the card that never fails to deliver.

Meeting with Russia’s defence minister and military chief of staff, the 69-year-old’s frustration at the position he finds himself in felt almost palpable.

Just last weekend, Russia conducted exercises with nuclear-capable cruise missiles. They normally happen each autumn but the timing was a clear message to Western countries not to interfere with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

On Thursday, when his forces started the attack, he had a clear warning to any nation contemplating responding to Russia’s actions: “the consequences will be such as you have never seen in your entire history"".

And so, on day four of this invasion, he has decided to remind the world in the clearest terms possible that Russia has the world’s largest nuclear arsenal with just under 4,500 warheads.

The timing of this maybe linked to negotiations between a team from the Ukrainian government and the Russians on the Belarus border.

Maybe President Putin feels now is the time to try to exert maximum pressure on any such deal to get the best terms he can. If so, early indications from Kyiv suggest he maybe disappointed. But to stop this war all sides will need to compromise - and fast - given the danger of the situation escalating even more out of control.",https://www.itv.com/news/2022-02-27/president-putin-puts-russias-nuclear-deterrent-forces-on-high-alert

“You can see some of the logistical difficulties that the Russian forces are experiencing.

“The Russian defence ministry have themselves conceded that they’re having casualties.

“This is a disastrous misbegotten venture by President Putin.”

White House press secretary Jen Psaki accused Mr Putin of resorting to the tactics he used running up to invasion, “which is to manufacture threats that don’t exist in order to justify further aggression”.

What is happening now in Ukraine is a real people’s war. We will not fall. We will not stop or get tired. We are determined to fight back fiercely as long as it is needed to defend our land and our people. — Dmytro Kuleba (@DmytroKuleba) February 27, 2022

Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg also condemned the move, saying: “This is dangerous rhetoric. This is a behaviour which is irresponsible.”

Dr Patricia Lewis, director international security programme at the Chatham House, international affairs think tank said Mr Putin was testing the West.

“This not ‘deterrence’ on Putin’s part, this is a threat,” she said.

In other developments:

– The European Union announced a fresh round of sanctions banning Russian aircraft from the EU airspace and barring the Kremlin-backed media, RT and Sputnik.

– BP announced it is selling its £10 billion stake in oil producer Rosneft, which it co-owns with the Kremlin, after pressure from the Government.

– The Football Association said England would not play Russia for the foreseeable future while FIFA said all Russia’s matches must be played in neutral countries without supporters.

– Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said she would support Britons who answered President Zelensky’s call to go to Ukraine to fight the Russians.

The Prime Minister was speaking at the Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral in London where he addressed the congregation.

He said that while he bore no hostility to the Russian people, there was no excuse for the country’s leaders who had chosen “the path of violence and aggression”.

“Never in all my study or memory of politics and international affairs have I seen so clear a distinction between right and wrong, between good and evil, between light and dark,” he said.

Earlier, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said that faced with the possible end of his regime, Mr Putin could resort to the “most unsavoury means” in Ukraine.

Asked on Sky News about Russia’s arsenal of chemical and tactical nuclear weapons, she said: “I urge the Russians not to escalate this conflict but we do need to be prepared for Russia to seek to use even worse weapons.”

Following the co-ordinated announcement by the UK, US, EU and Canada late on Saturday that some Russian banks would be excluded from the Swift global payments system, Ms Truss said it was vital to maintain pressure on Moscow with more economic sanctions.

She said the Foreign Office was drawing up a “hit list” of Russian oligarchs who would be targeted with travel bans and asset freezes in the coming weeks.

She acknowledged there would be an “economic cost” to pay for sanctions but said it was essential that President Putin was stopped in Ukraine to avert future wars in Europe.

“If we don’t stop Putin in Ukraine we are going to see others under threat – the Baltics, Poland, Moldova, and it could end up in a conflict with Nato,” she said.",https://www.expressandstar.com/news/uk-news/2022/02/27/boris-johnson-dismisses-putins-nuclear-warning-as-a-distraction/

Speaking to top military officials, including Defence Minister, Sergei Shoigu, he said Western nations had taken “unfriendly actions” towards Russia and imposed “illegitimate sanctions”.

But the U.S. has condemned Putin’s order putting Russia’s nuclear forces on a special state of alert.

The move makes it easier to launch weapons but BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said it was a way for Russia to send a warning to NATO, rather than signaling an intent to use them.

The U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, called the move unacceptable in an interview with CBS News.

“It means that Putin is continuing to escalate this war in a manner that is totally unacceptable and we have to continue to stem his actions in the strongest possible way,” she said.

White House Press Secretary, Jen Psaki has said Russia has never been under threat from NATO.

Putin blamed NATO leaders for allowing “aggressive statements” to be made against Russia. But Psaki said it was a familiar response from Russia’s president.

“We’ve seen him do this time and time again. At no point has Russia been under threat from Nato, has Russia been under threat from Ukraine,” she told ABC News.

“This is all a pattern from Putin and we’re going to stand up to it.”

“We have the ability to defend ourselves, but we also need to call out what we’re seeing here from President Putin,” she added.

Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky has released a statement following his conversation with Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko.

“We agreed that the Ukrainian delegation would meet with the Russian delegation without preconditions on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, near the Pripyat River.

“Lukashenko has taken responsibility for ensuring that all planes, helicopters and missiles stationed on Belarusian territory remain on the ground during the Ukrainian delegation’s travel, talks and return,” it read.

Zelensky had earlier said he would not meet a Russian delegation on Belarusian territory because Russia’s invasion was launched in part from Belarus.

Neither Russia nor Belarus has issued any statements about potential talks.

Also, 100,000 people are taking part in a protest against the Russian invasion in Berlin, German police says as Germany announces a huge increase in defence spending.

Demonstrators have filled a large area between the Brandenburg Gate and the Victory Column / Siegessäule and more people are arriving all the time. They say the crowd could end up reaching Alexanderplatz, three kilometres away.

Earlier this week, Germany also confirmed it would be sending 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger missiles to Ukraine.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba has said if Russia uses nuclear weapons against Ukraine it will be a “catastrophe for the world”.

Speaking at a news conference, Kuleba said: “This order by President Putin came shortly after the announcement was made about two delegations ready to meet [for talks].

“We see this announcement or this order as an attempt to raise the stakes and to put additional pressure on the Ukrainian delegation.

“But we will not give in to this pressure. We will approach these talks with a very simple approach. We go there to listen [to what] what Russia has to say and we will tell them what we think of all this.”

He adds: “Ukraine is not falling. We are bleeding, but we continue to successfully defend ourselves.”

5,c9516865-8f12-43f1-8720-b5ae7e9ce026,"['John Bolton', 'Written By']",2022-02-27 17:08:33+00:00,"Perhaps because Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has not gone nearly as quickly or decisively as he expected, Vladimir Putin is now trying to raise the stakes. Or at least pulse rates and blood pressures among skittish Western elites. His Sunday announcement that he had ordered Moscow’s nuclear deterrent forces to high alert produced all the publicity he must have expected, at home and abroad.

The actual operational consequences of the announcement remain unclear, but whether it is something more than information statecraft is doubtful. Overreacting or underreacting would give Putin more than he deserves.

For the Kremlin, this is an unusually late salvo in the Ukraine propaganda battle that Russia has been losing badly. Since launching the invasion Thursday, official pronouncements from Moscow have been very few, and mostly innocuous at that. In stunning contrast, Ukrainian officials, at the national and local levels, have been prolific disseminators of information, in traditional and social media. Western media reporting on Ukraine have amplified this information with videos, photos, and interviews with private Ukrainian citizens and soldiers, facilitating widespread dissemination of every piece of good news. There have even been media coverage adverse from around Russia, behind the lines, which Moscow has had mixed success in suppressing.

As in any propaganda war, the veracity of much of what is being said is still open to question, e.g., whether the Ukrainians on Snake Island were killed as Kyiv claimed, or taken prisoner as Moscow now says, after their iconic response to Russian admonitions to surrender. Winston Churchill rightly said that “[I]n wartime, truth is so precious that she should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies.” No one should be surprised if Ukraine isn’t well aware of that unpleasant but very omnipresent necessity.

By playing the nuclear card in Russia’s information-warfare deck, Putin aims to achieve two goals. First, he is appealing to his fellow citizens, continuing efforts to persuade them he simply had no choice but to invade Ukraine, largely because of NATO threats and historical grievances dating to World War II. That propaganda campaign inside Russia has not gone well, and Putin could readily have concluded he needed something more sensational to get people’s attention and rally them around his flag. And it couldn’t hurt the morale of Russian troops already in combat in Ukraine to know that Putin was showing their ace of spades as a backup. Whether this gambit works domestically or not is a different matter.

Putin’s real audience, however, was almost certainly political leaders in America and Europe that he considers week-kneed. Critical to producing the desired propaganda effect in foreign countries is the well-known reality that Russian military doctrine explicitly contemplates the first use of nuclear weapons, emphatically so at the tactical or battlefield level. Those in the West predisposed to assume the fetal position at the mere mention of nuclear weapons, and their numbers are substantial, are likely Putin’s main target. How well he succeeds, we shall soon see.

There must be no wavering in NATO’s continued urgent supply of weapons and other assistance to Ukraine’s government. There is nothing negotiable here with Russia, including at the possible peace talks coming soon at some point on the Ukraine-Belarus border. If the United States demonstrates any hesitation here, it will only ignite even more jitters in Europe, where displays of fortitude in the Ukraine crisis have been higher than expected, so far.

There remains the possibility that Putin is actually deadly serious about the imminent use of Russian nuclear capabilities in the Ukraine theater. Perhaps things are actually going even worse for Russia than already reported in Western media. Putin could worry that a coming military debacle would suffice to have him removed from power, and perhaps even collapse the entire regime he and his cohorts have created. In such a desperate situation, using nuclear weapons would create an entirely new scenario. Putin could assign blame to others for Russia’s conventional military failures, and use the radical uncertainty of the first wartime use of nuclear weapons since 1945 to cling to power.

This scenario is unlikely, but obviously deeply concerning. To date, the Biden administration has flooded the airwaves with intelligence information about the Kremlin’s capabilities and plans before Putin’s invasion began, unfortunately to no deterrent effect, and perhaps too promiscuously. If, however, there is ever a moment to use intelligence declassification in an information warfare effort, this is it.

In the meantime, we have much to be done both in Ukraine and elsewhere in the world where our adversaries may try to take advantage of the priority we are rightly according to Ukraine. Putin’s nuclear threat needs to be assessed seriously but not reflexively.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — In a dramatic escalation of East-West tensions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian nuclear forces put on high alert Sunday in response to what he called “aggressive statements” by leading NATO powers.

The directive to put Russia’s nuclear weapons in an increased state of readiness for launch raised fears that the crisis could boil over into nuclear warfare, whether by design or mistake.

Putin’s step is “potentially putting in play forces that, if there’s a miscalculation, could make things much, much more dangerous,” said a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Amid the mounting tensions, Ukraine announced that a delegation from the country had agreed to meet with Russian officials for talks. But the Kremlin’s ultimate aims in Ukraine — and what steps might be enough to satisfy Moscow — remained unclear.

The fast-moving developments came as scattered fighting was reported in Kyiv, battles broke out in Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, and strategic ports in the country’s south came under assault from Russian forces.

With Russian troops closing in around Kyiv, a city of almost 3 million, the mayor of the capital expressed doubt civilians could be evacuated.

Across the country, Ukrainian defenders were putting up stiff resistance that appeared to slow Russia’s advance.

“I wish I had never lived to see this,” said Faina Bystritska, 87, a Jewish survivor of World War II. She said sirens blare almost constantly in her embattled hometown, Chernihiv, about about 150 kilometers (90 miles) from Kyiv.

Chernihiv residents have been told not to switch on any lights “so we don’t draw their attention,” said Bystritska, who has been living in a hallway, away from windows, the better to protect herself.

“The window glass constantly shakes, and there is this constant thundering noise,” she said.

Meanwhile, the top official in the European Union outlined plans by the 27-nation bloc to close its airspace to Russian airlines and fund the purchase of weapons for Ukraine.

“For the first time ever, the European Union will finance the purchase and delivery of weapons and other equipment to a country that is under attack,” said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The EU will also ban some pro-Kremlin media outlets, she said.

Putin, in giving the nuclear alert directive, cited not only statements by NATO members — who have rushed to reinforce the military alliance’s members in Eastern Europe — but the hard-hitting financial sanctions imposed by the West against Russia, including Putin himself.

Speaking at a meeting with his top officials, Putin told his defense minister and the chief of the military’s General Staff to put nuclear forces in a “special regime of combat duty.”

“Western countries aren’t only taking unfriendly actions against our country in the economic sphere, but top officials from leading NATO members made aggressive statements regarding our country,” Putin said in televised comments.

U.S. defense officials would not disclose their current nuclear alert level except to say that the military is prepared all times to defend its homeland and allies.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki told ABC that Putin is resorting to a pattern he used in the weeks before the invasion, “which is to manufacture threats that don’t exist in order to justify further aggression.”

The practical meaning of Putin’s order was not immediately clear. Russia and the United States typically have land- and submarine-based nuclear forces on alert and prepared for combat at all times, but nuclear-capable bombers and other aircraft are not.

If Putin is arming or otherwise raising the nuclear combat readiness of his bombers, or if he is ordering more ballistic missile submarines to sea, then the United States might feel compelled to respond in kind, said Hans Kristensen, a nuclear analyst at the Federation of American Scientists. That would mark a worrisome escalation, he said.

Around the same time as Putin’s nuclear move, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s office announced that the two sides would meet at an unspecified location on the Belarusian border. The statement did not give a precise time for the meeting.

Earlier Sunday, Kyiv was eerily quiet after huge explosions lit up the morning sky and authorities reported blasts at one of the airports. Only an occasional car appeared on a deserted main boulevard as a strict 39-hour curfew kept people off the streets. Authorities warned that anyone venturing out without a pass would be considered a Russian saboteur.

Terrified residents hunkered down in homes, underground garages and subway stations in anticipation of a full-scale Russian assault. Supplies of food and medicine were running low, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said.

Authorities have been handing out weapons to anyone willing to defend the city, amid warnings of Russian saboteurs disguised as Ukrainian police or journalists. Ukraine is also releasing prisoners with military experience who want to fight, and training people to make firebombs.

“Right now, the most important question is to defend our country,” Klitschko said.

Pentagon officials said that Russian troops are being slowed by Ukrainian resistance, fuel shortages and other logistical problems, and that Ukraine’s air defense systems, while weakened, are still operating.

But a senior U.S. defense official said that will probably change: “We are in day four. The Russians will learn and adapt.”

Putin hasn’t disclosed his ultimate plans, but Western officials believe he is determined to overthrow Ukraine’s government and replace it with a regime of his own, reviving Moscow’s Cold War-era influence.

The fighting in southern Ukraine appeared aimed at seizing control of the country’s coastline. Cutting Ukraine’s access to its sea ports would deal a major blow to the country’s economy.

The number of casualties from Europe’s largest land conflict since World War II remained unclear amid the fog of war.

Ukraine’s health minister reported Saturday that 198 people, including three children, had been killed and more than 1,000 others wounded. It was unclear whether those figures included both military and civilian casualties.

Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov gave no figures on Russia’s dead and wounded Sunday but said his country’s losses were “many times” lower than Ukraine’s.

The U.N. refugee agency said Sunday that about 368,000 Ukrainians have arrived in neighboring countries since the invasion started Thursday.

Over the weekend, the U.S. pledged an additional $350 million in military assistance to Ukraine, including anti-tank weapons, body armor and small arms. Germany said it would send missiles and anti-tank weapons.

The U.S., European Union and Britain also agreed to block selected Russian banks from the SWIFT system, which moves money around thousands of banks and other financial institutions worldwide. They also moved to slap restrictions on Russia’s central bank.

Putin sent troops into Ukraine after building up a force of almost 200,000 troops along the country’s borders. He claims the West has failed to take seriously Russia’s security concerns about NATO, the Western military alliance that Ukraine aspires to join. But he has also expressed scorn about Ukraine’s right to exist as an independent state.

Russia claims its assault on Ukraine is aimed only at military targets, but bridges, schools and residential neighborhoods have been hit.

The United States immediately denounced the nuclear escalation threat by the Russian President as ""completely unacceptable"".

US ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said: ""President Putin is continuing to escalate this war in a manner that is totally unacceptable.""

The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, told CNN: “This is dangerous rhetoric. This is a behaviour which is irresponsible.”

It is not immediately clear what the “special mode of combat duty” entails with experts suggesting the move may have been a way of adding to pressure on Mr Zelensky to agree to the talks.

Pavel Podvig, a Geneva-based analyst and head of the Russian Nuclear Forces project, said it was hard to tell what the order meant but that it may be a “preliminary command”.

It made a retaliatory strike possible, he said, adding: “But does not mean preparation for a first strike.”

The moves came as Mr Zelensky announced he had agreed to talks with a Russian delegation on the Ukraine-Belarus border.

Mr Zelensky had earlier rejected an offer of talks in Belarus, saying the Russian ally had been a launchpad for the invasion of his country.

Earlier on Sunday the UK's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Putin may be prepared to use ""the most unsavoury means"" to secure victory in Ukraine.

Ms Truss said any use of nuclear or chemical weapons would represent an ""extremely serious escalation"" of the conflict which could see Russian leaders brought before the International Criminal Court.

Her warning came after the Commons Defence Committee chairman Tobias Ellwood said that in the ""worst-case scenario"" Mr Putin could deploy low yield tactical nuclear weapons if his forces failed to make a breakthrough.

With the Russian advance on the capital, Kyiv, apparently bogged down in the face of fierce Ukrainian resistance, Ms Truss said the survival of Mr Putin's regime could now be at stake if his invasion plan failed.

""This could well be the beginning of the end for Putin. I fear that he is prepared to use the most unsavoury means in this war,"" she told Sky News's Trevor Phillips on Sunday programme.

Asked about Russia's arsenal of chemical and tactical weapons, she said: ""I fear this conflict could be very, very bloody.

""I urge the Russians not to escalate this conflict but we do need to be prepared for Russia to seek to use even worse weapons. I think it would be hugely devastating. We need to avoid this at all costs.""

Speaking later on the BBC's Sunday morning programme, she said that senior Russian officials could be tried for war crimes ""if they do go into that arena"".

""This would be extremely serious escalation of the situation,"" she said.

Meanwhile, more than 200,000 people have been forced to flee Ukraine following the Russian invasion to bordering nations like Romania, Poland, Hungary, Moldova, and the Czech Republic.

The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said the invasion will have ""devastating humanitarian consequences"" on civilians.

During her TV interviews this moring Ms Truss declined to say how many refugees from Ukraine the UK will accept but insisted the UK Government is ""urgently"" looking at what more it can do.

Boris Johnson's Government has faced intense criticism over its failure so far to relax the visa requirements for Ukrainian nationals.

Ms Truss said Britain has always welcomed refugees fleeing from war, but did not say how soon the country will welcome people from Ukraine or how many will be accepted.

Asked if the Government will waive visa requirements for Ukrainians coming to the UK, she told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme with Sophie Raworth: ""It is a desperate situation.

""We're working with the United Nations, we're working with the Red Cross, to keep humanitarian corridors open.

""We've put support into the neighbouring countries like Slovakia and Poland to help with the refugee crisis.

""And of course Britain has always welcomed refugees fleeing from war, and we're urgently looking at what more we can do to facilitate that.

""But ultimately what we need to make sure is that we protect Ukraine as a sovereign democracy.

""Ultimately, the people of Ukraine want to live in Ukraine.""

It was put to the Cabinet minister that anyone who has no connection to the UK cannot get in, and she was asked if that will be changed.

She said: ""We are looking urgently at what we can do. We're working with European partners about how we support refugees who are leaving Ukraine. So, yes, is the answer.""

Pressed on how many refugees the UK will accept and how soon, Ms Truss said:

""Well, as I've said, this is something we are urgently looking at.""

She said the UK is already providing support on the ground with teams in Poland and Slovakia.

""I will be travelling to the region this week and we will do all we can to support Ukrainians, both in Ukraine and those who have had to flee because of this appalling war,"" she said.

Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said visa restrictions for those seeking sanctuary in the UK from Ukraine are ""totally unacceptable"".

The Russian invasion has left hundreds of civilians dead. Russia has launched missile strikes against buildings in Kyiv, Kharkiv and other major Ukrainian cities as it threatens an all-out assault not seen since the second world war.

On the fourth day of the full-scale assault Kyiv yesterday remained under Ukrainian control, while officials claimed they had repelled an attack on Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city, where street fighting was taking place.

Kharkiv residents were urged to stay indoors by its governor, Oleg Sinegubov, who said “there has been a breakthrough in light equipment including in the central part of the city”. A nine-storey building was reportedly hit, with one woman killed.

Russian forces also blew up a gas pipeline in the city, the Ukrainian state service of special communications said, prompting the government to warn of a potential “environmental catastrophe” and to urge people to protect themselves from the smoke by covering their windows.

President Zelensky has promised to arm foreign volunteers to travel to his country to join the battle against Mr Putin's forces.

Reports have emerged of foreign volunteers heading to Ukraine to help the resistance to Russia in what some commentators have compared to the help international fighters gave to Spain's anti-fascist fighters in the 1930s.

Asked on the BBC's Sunday Morning programme if she would support UK citizens who chose to answer the call, Ms Truss said: ‘I do. I do support that and of course that is something that people can make their own decisions about.

Nicola Sturgeon called yesterday on UK ministers for clarity on support for people fleeing the war after a UK Government Minister appeared to suggest they could come to Britain to pick fruit and vegetables. The First Minister said that asking refugees to be migrant seasonal workers is “not the route” people seeking refuge should rely on.

Meanwhile, Scottish external affairs secretary Angus Roberston demanded that Russian diplomats are expelled from Scotland and backed calls for the Russian Ambassador to the UK to be sent back to Moscow from London.

Ms Truss's warning that Mr Putin may be prepared to resort to ""the most unsavoury means"" to suppress Ukraine came after the Commons Defence Committee chairman Tobias Ellwood said that in the ""worst-case scenario"" Mr Putin could deploy low yield tactical nuclear weapons if his forces failed to make a breakthrough.

With the Russian advance on the capital, Kyiv, apparently bogged down in the face of fierce Ukrainian resistance, Ms Truss said the survival of Mr Putin's regime could now be at stake if his invasion plan failed.

Speaking later on the BBC's Sunday morning programme, she said that senior Russian officials could be tried for war crimes ""if they do go into that arena"".

""This would be extremely serious escalation of the situation,"" she said.

""The International Criminal Court has already said they are looking at what is happening in Ukraine and if I was a senior Russian official, or indeed the president, I would be very wary of taking further steps.""

Western officials have previously raised the prospect that the Russians could use thermobaric ""vacuum bombs"" which suck in oxygen to create a devastating, high temperature blast.

Mr Ellwood said Western allies needed to think now what their response would be if Mr Putin were to use unconventional forces.

""He could certainly use other weapons systems which haven't been really tested or that we aren't really used to,"" he told the BBC.

""Chemical weapons, the worst case scenario would be low yield tactical nuclear weapons as well. We need to ask those questions as to what we would do.""

Following the co-ordinated announcement by the UK, US, EU and Canada late on Saturday that some Russian banks would be excluded from the Swift global payments system, Ms Truss said it was vital to maintain pressure on Moscow with more economic sanctions.

She said the Government would bring forward its planned Economic Crime Bill next week and was drawing up a ""hit list"" of Russian oligarchs who would be targeted with travel bans and asset freezes in the coming weeks.

""There are over 100 billionaires in Russia. We have compiled a hit list of oligarchs. We are working through and putting the cases together, and every few weeks we will sanction new oligarchs,"" the Foreign Secretary told Sky News.

""We will be targeting oligarchs' private jets, we will be targeting their properties, we will be targeting other possessions that they have and there will be nowhere to hide.""

Ms Truss acknowledged there would be an ""economic cost"" to pay but said it was essential that President Putin was stopped to avert future wars in Europe.

""If we don't stop Putin in Ukraine we are going to see others under threat - the Baltics, Poland, Moldova, and it could end up in a conflict with Nato,"" she said.

""Yes, there will be an economic cost here in Britain, there will be a cost in terms of access to oil and gas markets. I firmly believe that the British public understand the price we will pay if we don't stand up to Putin now.""",https://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/19955749.putin-orders-russian-military-chiefs-put-nuclear-forces-high-alert/

One of the latest key developments saw Vladimir Putin order Russia’s nuclear deterrent forces to be put on alert amid the conflict.

The Russian state-run TASS news agency reported that President Putin made the decision at a meeting with defence minister Sergei Shoigu and chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia Valery Gerasimov.

The order was put in in response to “aggressive statements” from Nato countries - which includes the UK - so how worried should we be back home?

Here is everything you need to know.

How has the West responded?

Putin’s moves have been met with condemnation around the world, with many countries imposing sanctions on Russia in response.

Sanctions are a diplomatic tool to disadvantage countries in ways without using combat. They are usually financial in design, and can restrict how easy it is for one country to trade with another, or freeze important overseas assets.

It is hoped that sanctions in place against Russia will discourage it from any further escalation of the conflict, or even convince Putin to draw back his military advances.

In response to the recent nuclear escalation, the US condemned Putin’s statement, calling it “unacceptable”.

US ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said: “It means that President Putin is continuing to escalate this war in a manner that is totally unacceptable and we have to continue to stem his actions in the strongest possible way.”

Boris Johnson has dismissed Vladimir Putin’s announcement that he is putting Russia’s strategic nuclear deterrent on high alert as a “distraction” from struggle his troops are facing in Ukraine.

The Prime Minister suggested his actions were more to do with the fact that his forces were meeting with “more resistance than the Kremlin had bargained for”.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki accused Mr Putin of resorting to the tactics he used running up to invasion, “which is to manufacture threats that don’t exist in order to justify further aggression”

Will it lead to World War 3?

Tensions between any country and Russia - one of the world’s most powerful nuclear nations - are sure to cause unease among the wider international community.

As it stands, Ukraine is not a member of Nato, and so Nato member countries - including the UK - are not obligated to lend active combat personnel in its defence.

However, many allied countries have pledged to provide weaponry and other tools as a means of support, including the UK, which has already sent anti-tank weapons, and will also send “lethal defensive weapons” and “non-lethal aid” to the country.

With Nato also seemingly open to the idea of welcoming Ukraine into the fold - something of a red line for Putin - the bloc is not in the Russian president’s best books.

And with Nato members Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Hungary bordering western Ukraine - which could be strategically important for Russia- tensions there could ramp up as they position troops to defend themselves from potential Russian advances.

Were Russia to directly attack any of these countries, that would be cause for the Nato alliance to band together and defend itself from the threat, which could lead to a global conflict.

In short, so long as Nato and its member countries are not directly targeted by Russia, worldwide conflict should be averted.

Should I be worried?

The rhetoric around the conflict is anxiety making for many observers in the UK.

Boris Johnson has warned that the Russian incursion across the border into Ukraine “could be the biggest war in Europe” since the Second World War.

While General Sir Richard Sheriff, Britain’s former top Nato commander, has called the Ukraine situation the most perilous in Europe for decades.

So should we be worried?

In Putin’s statement ordering Russia’s nuclear deterrent to be put on alert, he said he was ordering the “transfer the deterrence forces of the Russian army to a special mode of combat duty.”

It remains unclear what “special mode of combat duty” means in practice, but it is clearly a provocation to the West.

It may also be a signal of the Russian leader’s frustration with the fact that, days into the invasion of Ukraine, his forces have yet to capture any city, and have sustained heavy casualties.

Commons Defence Committee chairman Tobias Ellwood said that in the “worst-case scenario” Putin could deploy low yield tactical nuclear weapons if his forces failed to make a breakthrough in Ukraine.

Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee Tom Tugendhat has said Russia sees battlefield nuclear weapons as simply “a bigger bang” and could give a military order to use them.

The Conservative MP told the BBC’s Radio 4 Today programme: “The Russian military doctrine doesn’t work in the same way as the Nato military doctrine.

“They do assume that they may use battlefield nuclear weapons and they see them as just a, if you’ll excuse the expression, a bigger bang. They don’t treat fallout in the same way we do.”

He added that although the situation was “concerning,” it was not unprecedented for Russia to threaten nuclear action.

Ellwood said Western allies needed to think now what their response would be if the Russians were to use unconventional forces.

But life goes on for the children of the Kharkiv Hippocrates centre where they treat patients with the most serious nervous system conditions.

The centre is a hospice and a rehabilitation facility. Its head, Dr Roman Marabyan, had been called up to the army, so I spoke to his deputy, Valentyna Drokina.

She seems overoptimistic for a doctor stuck with her patients in a city that’s been seeing no reprieve from Russia.

In more peaceful times, the centre used to care for dozens of young patients from the Kharkiv region and north-eastern Ukraine.

Some children were orphans - their parents abandoned them in state facilities after learning their diagnoses. The centre’s nurses and doctors have become not just children’s carers, but parental figures. Other children usually had mothers by their side.

The war has brought all of them together.

“We are one family now,” says Valentyna Drokina. Her centre welcomes all abandoned children with life-threatening conditions and those with their parents who didn’t have enough time to flee Kharkiv.

Out of 21 children that are being treated in this facility, only three can walk on their feet. Valentyna tells me the centre’s professionals had equipped its basement so that the children could spend the most dangerous hours down there.
