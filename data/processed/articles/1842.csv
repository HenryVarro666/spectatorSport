However, Putin himself believes that the conditions for a ceasefire in Ukraine have not yet been created. At least that's what he told Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi in a telephone conversation. This was announced by Draghi at a press conference on Thursday, the EP reports with reference to Reuters.

Nuclear objects

Russian troops begin to leave the Chornobyl nuclear power plant. This was reported by sources in the Pentagon. So far, only part of the troops has left the station.

We have already shipped the top 50 cargo planes out of about 30 within the $800 million received by the president."" Kirby stressed that the shipments include weapons that Ukrainian forces need most, including anti-tank and anti-aircraft systems.

Norwegian authorities sent 2,000 M72 anti-tank grenade launchers to Ukraine. This decision was made after the speech of the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Norwegian Parliament.

Ukraine will be able to buy weapons from German defense companies. Preliminarily, the purchase of weapons and equipment worth €300 million has already been agreed upon. In total, about 200 items are on the list and some of them will be delivered as soon as possible.

The Spanish government has already sent ten offensive planes to Ukraine. This was stated by Spanish Defense Minister Margarita Robles.

News from partners

Ambassador of Ukraine to Poland, Andrii Deshchytsia, said that Ukraine was negotiating with Poland on the possibility of completely closing the border with Belarus. According to the ambassador, the diplomatic mission is negotiating with the Polish Ministry of Infrastructure and the Polish government. The primary goal is to close the border with Belarus by 100%. However, even if this decision is not taken at the level of the European Union. Andrii Deshchytsia also stressed that diplomats from Ukraine were discussing similar issues with the Baltic states.

Germany is ready to provide security guarantees to Ukraine, but after the end of hostilities, said German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerboсk.

And this is Denmark playing with the Netherlands. Thank you for your solidarity with the Ukrainian people!

Russian nuclear planes violated Swedish airspace. Sweden believes that this was intimidation.

What's in Russia?

Unrecognized South Ossetia will soon take legal steps to join Russia. Reunification with Russia is the country's strategic goal. This was stated by the President of South Ossetia Bibilov. Prior to that, the leader of the so-called ""LPR"" Leonid Pasichnyk stated the same intentions, but he was told by Russia that ""now is not the time.""

Self-proclaimed Abkhazia abandoned the idea of ​​joining Russia.

Meanwhile, soldiers from South Ossetia refused to ""liberate"" Donbas and returned home. The information was confirmed by the former President of South Ossetia Eduard Kokoity. He said that ""it is not necessary to condemn the military,"" but it is necessary to ""understand the reasons for what happened."" Ossetian blogger Alik Pukhayev also said that 300 servicemen refused to fight voluntarily: ""Today, about 300 servicemen (mostly ethnic Ossetians) from a Russian military base returned to South Ossetia voluntarily because they thought they had been left to die during a 'special operation' in Ukraine,"" he wrote. And rightly so.

13:00 – Georgia reacted to South Ossetia's statement on holding a referendum on joining Russia: ""Talks on a referendum in South Ossetia are unacceptable,"" said the Georgian Foreign Minister.

Putin ""turned on the back"" about paying for gas in rubles. The aggressor country will not require Europeans to pay for gas supplies in rubles. They will be able to pay in euros. This was stated by German government spokesman Steffen Seibert following a telephone conversation between Putin and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

The French Embassy in Russia will start issuing tourist visas in April. From 1 April 2022, it will be possible to apply for all types of visas to France, including tourist visas, without restrictions related to COVID-19. This was reported on the website of the Consulate General of the French Embassy in Russia. It becomes clear why Macron calls Putin every week.

In Russia, there was hysteria over the disqualification of skaters. Russian-titled Russian coach Tatiana Tarasova reacted to the International Skating Union's (ISU) decision to remove Russian figure skaters from competition because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine: ""You should have a conscience. The life of an athlete is very short, and they take it away. Bandits!"" Disrespectful Tarasova, your compatriots, real thugs of the Russian army, are taking the lives of Ukrainians, not figuratively, but literally. But you are unlikely to realize this, so the sanctions will continue to work.

The thief country doesn't return leased aircraft to Europe. AerCap, the world's largest aircraft leasing company, is demanding from insurers about $3.5 billion in compensation for aircraft stuck in Russia, Bloomberg reports. It is noted that the Irish company managed to return only 22 of the 135 aircraft and 3 of the 14 engines installed on Russian aircraft before the ""special operation.""

What about Belarus?

The occupiers are using the airport in Brest, Belarus, to shell Ukraine. The issue of the invasion of Belarusian troops into our country ""went away."" ""The offensive from Belarus is already underway, but not the Belarusian army. Moreover, the Russians have begun to use the Brest airport, from which the shelling of our territories starts,"" said the adviser to the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine Vadym Denisenko.

The second train in three days in Belarus derailed. It was equipped with Russian military equipment. 8 activists were detained.

And in Ukraine, the Ukrainian Armed Forces began to form a Belarusian regiment Pogonia (Chase) of Belarusian volunteers. The regiment was created on the initiative of Belarusian officers with the support of the Armed Forces to protect the independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as to create a base for a new professional Belarusian army.

Russian lies

The Center for Strategic Communications explored the main narratives in Russia's Telegram channels on March 28-29. Russian fascist propagandists talk about ""neo-Nazis,"" the sale of orphans, and discrimination against black people. The occupying country demonizes the Ukrainian army and lies about bullying the Russian military, promotes the topic of ""black transplantology"" and argues that poverty has already begun in Europe because of sanctions against Russia. All these are obvious throwaways and fakes.

The Kremlin's lies are very professional and convincing. According to a Levada Center poll, after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russian support for Putin's actions rose to 83%.

Russian fascist propagandist Simonyan and her fictional flash mob.

The Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security states that Russian propaganda media have begun to disperse new lies about Ukraine. They claim our country allegedly did purposeful work to distort the historical truth and ideological preparation for the military operation against Russia. This conclusion is based on the results of an ""analysis of about 300 Ukrainian textbooks and manuals"" conducted by Russian educators and historians. The aggressor state pretends to be the victim, and the victim is tried to be shown as the aggressor. This is how politics is done in Putin's Russia.

Sanctions on the aggressor!

Australia imposes additional duties of 35% on all goods imported from Russia and Belarus.

Japan has included gold bars in the list of luxury items; now they're prohibited to export to Russia. This is the strengthening of sanctions in response to Russian aggression in Ukraine. In addition to ingots, it is also forbidden to export gold coins and banknotes.

Britain has expanded the list of sanctions against Russia. It includes:

– Chairman of the National Center for Defense Management of Russia Mikhail Mizintsev;

– TV presenter Sergei Brilov;

– General Director of Gazprom-Media Aleksandr Zharov;

– Russia Today media group (works under the Sputnik brand);

– RT channel.

Life considering hostilities

Ukrainian karateka Stanislav Horuna has put up for sale his bronze medal, won at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. He will donate the money to support the army. ""My Olympic medal is the most valuable of the more than 200 medals I have won in my 19 years of career. It symbolizes every victory won on the way to the Olympics. I want to sell it at auction and support my people in this difficult time. There's now nothing more important than Ukraine,"" said the athlete.

He noted that in the last week Ukraine began to return to work. ""Business is starting to recover after the first shock. A set of decisions in the field of tax, regulatory, customs, and credit policy has certainly contributed to this. Immediately, several of the largest plants begin to operate,"" said Shmyhal.

After the war, new buildings in Ukraine will be designed with a bomb shelter and a fortified underground parking lot, says Infrastructure Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov.
