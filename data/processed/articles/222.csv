Almost exactly 30 years after the devastating siege of Sarajevo, another major European capital came under heavy bombardment with shells hitting apartment blocks, driving up the civilian death toll. The onslaught of bombing intensified on Friday night, accompanied by artillery rounds and heavy gunfire on the city’s streets.

In a bleak statement, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, warned that several cities were under attack. “This night will be the hardest … We must withstand. The night will be very hard, but sunrise will come.”

In the hours after he spoke, multiple explosions were reported across the capital amid reports that Russian troops were advancing on the city centre.

After the second day of the invasion, it was clear that it was being fiercely resisted, but also that Russia had much more military might yet to be unleashed on its neighbour.

Ukrainians prepared a last-ditch defence of their capital, with barricades, and called for civilians to arm themselves with molotov cocktails.

According to US estimates, Russia has fired 200 ballistic and cruise missiles at Ukraine, mostly hitting military targets but some landing in residential areas.

As human rights groups accused Russia of war crimes, the prosecutor at the International Criminal Court issued a reminder he has jurisdiction to investigate atrocities committed inside Ukraine.

US defence officials said that the Russian offensive was facing stiffer resistance than its commanders had anticipated. They had so far not established unchallenged air superiority, for example. But the US estimates that Moscow had only committed a third of the attacking force it had mustered around Ukraine’s borders in recent months.

According to the Pentagon, 10 amphibious landing ships unloaded thousands of naval infantry to the west of Mariupol, potentially cutting off the port city.

In a televised address marked by more of the extreme rhetoric that has accompanied the invasion, Vladimir Putin described the the government in Kyiv as as “terrorists” and “a gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis”.

Earlier in the day, Zelenskiy posted a video of himself and his aides outside the presidential office to counter Russian media rumours that he had fled.

“We are here. We are in Kyiv. We are defending Ukraine.”

01:02 'We are defending our country alone,' Zelenskiy tells Ukrainians as Russia approaches Kyiv – video

Western intelligence agencies have predicted that Zelenskiy and his top officials could be targeted for assassination as Russia seeks to decapitate the country.

“It’s clear the kind of vitriol coming from Russia about the Ukrainian leadership, so I think we can expect that they would be targets for Russian forces coming into the city,” one western official said.

Russia was forced to vote alone at the UN security council on Friday night against a resolution deploring its actions. As Russia holds a veto, the resolution was not upheld, but the US and its allies score a small diplomatic victory by persuading China not to vote with Russia but abstain, by slightly watering down the language. They were unable to win over India and the United Arab Emirates, who also abstained.

Tremors from the invasion continued to spread around the world on Friday, demonstrating the potential for the already disastrous conflict to spill over Ukraine’s borders.

Nato activated its rapid response force which had been established as a contingency in the event of a serious threat on the alliance’s flank.

The Kremlin also issued a direct threat to Finland and Sweden, which have been openly contemplating Nato membership as a result of the invasion.

“Their accession to Nato can have detrimental consequences … and face military and political consequences,” the foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said.

Earlier in the day, barricades went up around the city as its defenders set up positions on bridges prepared for an onslaught, more Russian troops converged on the city from three directions, and Putin urged Ukraine’s military to seize power from the elected government, and bow to his demands to disarm and rule out Nato membership.

Streams of people – mostly women and children, since Ukrainian men aged 18-60 are forbidden to leave – crossed into Hungary, Poland and Romania, with 15-hour queues reported at border points. Guards fired warning shots to prevent a stampede at Kyiv’s central station as thousands tried to force their way on to evacuation trains.

Ukrainian officials claimed nearly 3,000 Russian servicemen had been killed so far, but warned that advance enemy units had already entered the Obolonskyi district of northern Kyiv. The defence ministry advised residents to “prepare molotov cocktails”.

The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, said the city had entered “a defensive phase”. He added: “Shots and explosions are ringing out … and saboteurs have already entered Kyiv. The enemy wants to put the capital on its knees and destroy us.”

In video footage thought to be from south Ukraine, near Crimea, a Ukrainian civilian was shown standing in front of an advancing Russian military convoy, in scenes reminiscent of Tiananmen Square in 1989, in which a lone Chinese protestor stood in front of a tank, stopping its advance.

US officials estimated Russia had launched more than 200 missiles at Ukraine, including both ballistic and cruise weapons. They said most had been aimed at military targets but that some had landed in residential districts, and that it was unclear whether that was accidental or deliberate.

The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, issued a reminder that he had the authority to investigate war crimes inside Ukraine and Amnesty International accused the Russian military of “indiscriminate attacks” after investigating several incidents, including a missile strike on a hospital building in Vuhledar in eastern Ukraine, which killed four civilians and wounded 10 more.

In another sign of the war’s potential to spin out of control, two more merchant ships were hit by errant missile strikes in the Black Sea, a Japanese bulk carrier and a Moldovan chemical tanker.

Zelenskiy earlier on Friday accused Europe of not being hard or quick enough in sanctioning Russia earlier, urging citizens to compel their governments to do more to stop Putin’s invasion.

“Europe has enough strength to stop this aggression,” he said. “You have to act swiftly. We demand effective counteraction to the Russian Federation. Sanctions must be further strengthened.”

The Ukrainian government continued its appeals to the EU to step up its sanctions, expressing bitter disappointment that the measures taken so far had not included Russia’s exclusion from the Swift global electronic payments system.

The German finance ministry said on Friday that it was open to the proposal of including Swift sanctions, while the US, EU and the UK moved to freeze the foreign-held assets of Putin and his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. The US also sanctioned Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, and the chief of the general staff, Valery Gerasimov.

The initiative was largely symbolic, as the Russian president is not thought to have identifiable personal wealth abroad. However, the Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, told a Russian TV station Friday night that relations with the west “have reached the line after which the point of no return begins”.

In Kyiv, Zelenskiy said in a televised address that Putin was targeting civilian as well as military sites. “They say that civilian objects are not a target for them. It is a lie; they do not distinguish in which areas to operate,” he said, vowing to continue defending his country and criticising world leaders for “watching from afar”.

In Russia, thousands of people defied tough anti-protest legislation to stage anti-war rallies across the country on Thursday night. OVD-Info, which monitors arrests at opposition protests, said more than 1,800 people in 59 cities had been detained.

Lt Gen Jim Hockenhull, the UK’s head of defence intelligence, released a statement to reporters about the state of the fighting in Ukraine: “Russian forces continue to advance on two axes towards Kyiv. Their objective is to encircle the capital, to secure control of the population and change the regime..”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/kyiv-attack-latest-russia-invasion-ukraine

The city was braced for battle heading into the weekends as Russian troops continued to advance and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had issued a desperate plea for help.

“The fate of Ukraine is being decided now,” Zelenskyy said in an address on social media. “Special attention is on Kyiv — we should not lose the capital. The enemy will use all the possible forces they have to break our resistance. They will be mean and hard. Tonight they will begin a full scale storm.”

Russian troops bore down on the city as the global backlash mounted against the unprovoked attack on a European democracy.

Explosions, air raid sirens and the sound of gunfire filled the air over Kyiv on Friday. Officials in Kyiv urged citizens to take shelter and street fighting was occurring. Explosions were heard overnight, and video showed fighting near the Kyiv Zoo.

In the morning, Zelenskyy posted a video standing in front of what appeared to be a building next to the presidential office in Kyiv. “I’m here,” he said.

Zelenskyy denied what he said were false claims of an evacuation. “We won’t put down [our] weapon, we’ll protect our country,” he said in the video, according to an NBC News translation.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said Saturday said that Russian troops trying to enter the city have been beaten back, but other sabotage and reconnaissance groups were inside.

“The night was difficult, but there are no Russian troops in the capital,” Klitschko said in a Telegram message Saturday morning, according to an NBC News translation. “The enemy is trying to break into the city.”

As of 6 a.m. 35 people had been injured, including two children, he said.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Friday that “no strikes are being made on civilian infrastructure,” The Washington Post reported. And the Russian Ministry of Defence said Friday that it was doing all it could to avoid civilian casualties.

Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, said on Twitter on Saturday morning that Kyiv ""survived another night under attacks by Russian ground forces, missiles,"" and one hit a residential apartment. NBC News has not independently verified that allegation.

Photos of the building showed heavy damage to several floors with walls and windows blown out and a fire burning inside. The fire was extinguished and the building was being evacuated, according to the State Emergency Service of Ukraine.

Information on injuries was not immediately available early Saturday.

The Ukrainian military said in a Facebook post that Russian troops attacked an army base in Kyiv around midnight on Saturday but were repelled. The military also said there were ""heavy battles"" in Vasylkiv, a city near the capital. NBC News was not able to independently verify the Ukrainian military's accounts.

The mayor of Vasylkiv said Russian paratroopers landed but were repulsed. NBC News has not independently verified that claim.

There is fighting on the outskirts of the capital of Kyiv and in the coastal city of Mariupol, but presidential adviser Mykhailo Podoliak said the situation was under control.

“We knew that tonight was going to be a difficult night,” Podoliak said, adding that Russian attempts to harm Ukrainian cities “didn’t work.”

On Friday, the United States and European Union took the rare step of imposing sanctions on a head of state by targeting Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Biden administration also slapped sanctions on Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and other members of Russia’s Security Council.

Zelenskyy spoke by phone with President Joe Biden for roughly 40 minutes on Friday, the White House said. Ukraine’s leader tweeted that the two discussed “strengthening sanctions, concrete defense assistance and an anti-war coalition.”

At the United Nations, a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Russia's military aggression was vetoed — by Russia. The council voted 11-1 Friday in favor of the resolution, and Russia was the lone vote against it. Three countries abstained.

Putin suggested he might be willing to enter negotiations with Ukraine even as his forces continued their advance across the country. But hours later, the Russian leader urged Ukrainian soldiers to overthrow their government, which he described a ""gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis"" — repeating propaganda Russia uses to justify its actions.

But hours later, the Russian leader urged Ukrainian soldiers to overthrow their government, which he described a “gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis” — repeating propaganda Russia uses to justify its actions.

Inside the embattled capital, Zelenskyy refused to leave and instead made a desperate plea for Western governments to take tougher measures against Moscow.

He has already called up any Ukrainians willing to fight and handed out thousands of guns to civilians. And on Friday, Zelenskyy urged anyone with military experience in Europe to travel to Ukraine and help defend its independence or take to their own streets in protest.

“We are defending our independence, our country,” he said in his latest video message. ""It will continue like this. Glory to our defenders, glory to Ukraine.”

The fresh plea from the Ukrainian leader came as the invading Russian troops bore down on Kyiv amid a desperate defense in which hundreds of troops on either side were reportedly killed.

Oksana Markarova, the Ukrainian ambassador to the U.S., said at a news conference Friday that Russia committed what she characterized as war crimes, targeting civilians, taking nearly 100 people hostage at Chernobyl and striking an orphanage with 50 children inside.

""The Russian propaganda machine says that civilians were not targeted. I want to tell you this is not true,"" Markarova told reporters.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko described Russia's offensive in stark terms.

“The enemy wants to put the capital on its knees and destroy us,"" said Klitschko, a former world heavyweight boxing champion. “The city has gone into a defensive phase. Shots and explosions are ringing out in some neighborhoods. Saboteurs have already entered Kyiv.”

Russia is nonetheless meeting “greater resistance” from the Ukrainians than it might have expected, a senior U.S. defense official said Friday.

“They are fighting for their country,” the official said, referring to Ukrainian troops and freedom fighters.

The official said Russian forces are undertaking an amphibious assault to the west of the city of Mariupol, and the United States has indications Russia is placing potentially thousands of naval forces ashore there. American officials assume Russian troops will then attempt to move toward the Donbas region, the official added.

Local officials warned residents in Obolon, a district north of the capital, not to go outside early Friday due to ""the approach of active hostilities."" The military said Russian saboteurs — troops disguised in Ukrainian uniforms — were in the streets.

Meanwhile just outside the capital, Russia claimed it had taken control of the strategic Hostomel Airport, which handles heavy cargo flights and would allow Moscow to airlift troops directly to Kyiv. A day earlier, Ukraine's military said that Russian troops sustained heavy casualties in the fighting there.

NBC News has not verified either side's reports.

Local officials said that Russia had captured the southern city of Kherson despite its “significant forces” suffering “great loses.”

In the northeastern city of Kharkiv, NBC News correspondent Matt Bradley reported around noon local time Friday that car alarms went off across the city as loud, sustained bombardments drew closer.

“Up until now, we understood Russian troops had set up around the ring road of the city. Now we understand they are moving in,” he said from an underground parking garage filled with journalists and local residents, including children.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-invasion-kyiv-attack-putin-advance-zelenskyy-rcna17660

Kyiv, Ukraine – Ukraine's Minister of Defense had issued a call for civilians between 18 and 60 to take up arms to help defend the country, but on Friday, as Russian troops got closer to the center of the city, he asked anyone over the age of 18 to volunteer. The government has also banned men between the ages of 18 and 60 from leaving Ukraine.

CBS News saw a steady stream of people entering one makeshift recruitment center in Kyiv on Friday morning, ready to join the fight.

When asked if Ukraine was ready to fight, he said: ""We will fight as much as we can. We will fight because we have our families… our country and our lifestyle that we are not ready to give up.""

A commander at the center, who did not want to be identified, told CBS News that thousands of people had arrived to fight, but that many did not have any military experience. He said there were not enough guns to go around.

""Citizens of Kyiv are gathering here. They are receiving weapons here and guidelines how to run urban combat, how to provide medical first aid, and how to destroy Russians and take their weapons,"" he said.

The sound of gunfire has echoed through Kyiv, with the mayor saying Russia is trying to put the city ""on its knees"".

After unleashing airstrikes, Russian tanks were filmed rolling into Kyiv for the first time earlier.

The UK's chief of defence intelligence, Lieutenant General Sir Jim Hockenhull, said Russia had launched a ""concerted series of strikes on targets in Kyiv"", while rocket launchers had been employed in Chernihiv and Kharkiv.

""Russian forces continue to advance on two axes towards Kyiv,"" he said. ""Their objective is to encircle the capital to secure control of the population and change the regime.""

In Kyiv, residents have been told to stay at home, but the defence ministry also advised making Molotov cocktails to ""neutralise the occupier"".

Air raid sirens went off and shooting was heard near the government quarter. Many residents have left, while others huddled in shelters.

The Russian defence ministry claimed its forces had blocked Kyiv from the West and taken control of Gostomel airport nearby, according to the Russian TASS news agency.

On Friday afternoon, however, the UK Ministry of Defence said the bulk of Russian forces remained more than 50km (31 miles) from Kyiv city centre.

Russia has not taken any Ukrainian population centres so far, a US defence official said on Friday afternoon.

""The enemy wants to put the capital on its knees and destroy us,"" Mr Klitschko said. ""Saboteurs have already entered Kyiv.""

Ukraine's interior ministry said several sabotage groups were destroyed in Kyiv on Friday, while saboteurs had also appeared in other cities.

President Zelenskyy said 137 Ukrainians had been killed and 316 injured since the invasion began.

Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said Russia was planning a ""massive false flag operation to 'dehumanize' Ukrainians and accuse Ukraine of alleged inhuman actions"".

He also said some European leaders were still being ""hesitant"" in their opposition to Russia.

He tweeted: ""Each year at commemorative events you say 'Never again'.

""The time to prove it is now. Russia is waging a horrific war of aggression in Europe. Here is your 'never again' test: BAN RUSSIA FROM SWIFT and kick it out of everywhere.""

Removing Russia from the SWIFT global payments system would damage Russia's economy both immediately and in the long term, but other countries could suffer too.

Boris Johnson has urged international leaders to take immediate action on SWIFT to ""inflict maximum pain on President Putin and his regime"", Downing Street said on Friday afternoon.

German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said his country was open to removing Russia from the system, but had to calculate the consequences for its own economy first.

On Friday afternoon, Russian President Vladimir Putin appealed directly to Ukrainian troops, saying it was ""easier to negotiate with you"" than the ""gang of Nazis that has captured Kyiv"" - an apparent reference to Ukraine's leadership.

""Take power into your own hands, it will be easier for us to reach agreement,"" he added.

US officials believe Mr Putin aims to dismantle the government and replace it with his own regime, while Mr Zelenskyy said he is ""target number one"" for Russia.

UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said Russia was ""behind its hoped-for timetable"" and had lost more than 450 personnel.

The Ukrainian government said Russia had lost as many as 1,000 personnel, more than a dozen aircraft and 30 tanks.

Ukraine's interior ministry said Russia attacked 33 civilian sites over a 24-hour period and two children were killed, according to the Interfax news agency.

The Kremlin said Russia is ready for talks with Ukraine - but spokesman Dmitry Peskov said they would have to be about Ukraine declaring a ""neutral status"" between Russia and the West.

Russia has long demanded that Ukraine rules out joining NATO.

Some 100,000 Ukrainians are believed to have fled their homes, according to the United Nations, but the country's border guard service has said that males aged 18-60 are not allowed to leave.

A mass mobilisation decree was issued by Mr Zelenskyy which requires all conscripts and reservists to help ""ensure the needs"" of Ukraine's military, paving the way for civilians to take up arms.

Ukraine's armed forces believe more than 60 Russian battalion tactical groups - the equivalent of between 30,000 and 60,000 troops - have been deployed.

Mr Putin is thought to be targeting a blockade of Kyiv and the creation of a land corridor on Ukraine's southeastern coast towards the Crimean Peninsula - which Moscow annexed in 2014 - and the Transdniestria region of neighbouring Moldova that is held by pro-Russian separatists.
