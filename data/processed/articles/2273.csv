Good afternoon.



Russia has attacked Ukraine.

This is a brutal act of war.

Our thoughts are with the brave people of Ukraine.

Sadly, what we have warned against for months has come to pass.

Despite all calls on Russia to change course and tireless efforts to seek a diplomatic solution.

Peace in our continent has been shattered. We now have war in Europe, on a scale and of a type we thought belong to history.

We have just finished an emergency meeting of the North Atlantic Council to discuss the situation.

The Council also addressed the request by Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia to hold urgent consultations under Article 4 of the Washington Treaty.

This is a grave moment for the security of Europe.



Russia’s unjustified and unprovoked attack on Ukraine is putting countless innocent lives at risk.

With air and missile attacks.

Ground forces and special forces from multiple directions.

Targeting military infrastructure and major urban centres.

This is a deliberate, cold-blooded and long-planned invasion.

Despite its litany of lies, denials, and disinformation,

the Kremlin’s intentions are clear for the world to see.

Russia’s leaders bear full responsibility for their reckless actions and the lives lost.

NATO Allies condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in the strongest possible terms.

This is a blatant violation of international law.

An act of aggression against a sovereign, independent and peaceful country.

And a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security.

We call on Russia to immediately cease its military action.

Withdraw its forces from Ukraine.

And choose diplomacy.

We fully support Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.

And Ukraine’s right of self-defence.

Russia is using force to try to rewrite history.

And deny Ukraine its free and independent path.

NATO’s core task is to protect and defend all Allies.

There must be no room for miscalculation or misunderstanding.

An attack on one will be regarded as an attack on all.

This is our collective security guarantee.

Today, the North Atlantic Council decided to activate our defence plans,

At the request of our top military commander, General Tod Wolters.

This is a prudent and defensive step to protect and shield Allied nations during this crisis.

And it will enable us to deploy capabilities and forces, including the NATO Response Force, to where they are needed.

In response to Russia’s massive military build-up,

we have already strengthened our collective defence.

On land, at sea, and in the air.

In the last weeks, Allies from North America and Europe have deployed thousands of more troops to the eastern part of the Alliance.

And placed more on standby.

We have over 100 jets at high alert, protecting our airspace.

And more than 120 Allied ships at sea, from the High North to the Mediterranean.

All this shows that our collective defence commitment Article 5 is ironclad.

And we will continue to do whatever is necessary to shield the Alliance from aggression.

I have called a virtual Summit of NATO leaders tomorrow, to address the way forward.

Russia is now facing severe costs and consequences imposed by the whole international community.

The Kremlin’s aim is to re-establish its sphere of influence.

Rip up the global rules that have kept us all safe for decades.

And subvert the values that we hold dear.

This is the new normal for our security.

Peace cannot be taken for granted.

Freedom and democracy are contested by authoritarian regimes.

And strategic competition is on the rise.

We must respond.

With renewed resolve.

And even stronger unity.

North America and Europe, together in NATO.

We are an Alliance of 30 democracies. Standing as one,

We will protect our people and our values.

Democracy will always prevail over autocracy.

Freedom will always prevail over oppression.

And then, I am ready to take your questions.

NATO Spokesperson Oana Lungescu: Interfax Ukraine.

Irina Somer (Interfax Ukraine): Thank you Oana. Secretary General, we all know that NATO will not fight for Ukraine. But don't you think it's time for NATO to build anti-Hitler sorry, anti-Putin coalition? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: NATO stands in solidarity with Ukraine and NATO allies are imposing severe costs on Russia for the reckless invasion of Ukraine.

NATO allies, in close coordination with the European Union and other partners all over the world, are now imposing severe economic sanctions on Russia. To demonstrate that, we follow up on what we said, and that is that it will be a high price for Russia to pay.

NATO allies have also over a long period of time provided support, practical support, military support to Ukraine and helped them to build a much stronger, much better equipped, much better trained armed force today than the Ukraine had in 2014. I would like to recognize the professionalism and the bravery of the Ukrainian men and women in uniform who are now standing up against the Russian invasion.

We continue to stand together, condemning the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine and Allies stand together also in sending a message that we will never accept the brutal violation of international law that we see taking place as Russia now invades Ukraine.

NATO Spokesperson: We'll go to Bloomberg.

Natalia Drozdiak (Bloomberg): (Inaudible) Do you have any information that shows that NATO Allies face a direct threat from Russia at the moment, and would NATO reconsider military intervention in Ukraine? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General: NATO is the strongest alliance in history, and make no mistake; we will defend and protect every ally against any attack and every inch of NATO territory. And that's the reason also we have increased our presence in the eastern part of the alliance with thousands of more troops, ships and planes over the last weeks to send a very clear message; an attack on one ally will trigger the response of the whole Alliance. And we do so not to provoke a conflict but to prevent a conflict. What we do is defensive, it's prudent, its measured, but it is necessary, because we see the aggressive actions of Russia against Ukraine, and therefore allies also how to make sure that there is no room for any misunderstanding about that Russia can’t do anything like that against a NATO allied country.

NATO Spokesperson: National Public Radio.

Teri Schultz (NPR): Thank you. Teri Schultz with NPR and DW. Mr. Secretary General, in the in the NAC statement, you say that we're deploying additional defensive land and air forces to the eastern part of the Alliance additional maritime assets and increase the readiness of forces. Is this now today, more forces being sent as a result of the fact that the invasion has now happened, or are you there referring to what has already been done as reinforcements? I understand SACEUR will now have the ability to assemble the VJTF without coming back to the NAC for approval. Finally, are you still willing to sit down with President Putin or other representatives of the Russian government after this, or are you suspending your offer to hold talks on other issues and the NATO Russia Council? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General: This invasion does not come as a surprise. We have warned against this for months and sadly what happened this morning during the night was something that allied security and intelligence services have predicted for a long time. We have tried to prevent it by calling Russia to engage in diplomatic efforts, by telling Russia that there will be severe costs or economic sanctions if they invade Ukraine further. But what happened over the last hours demonstrates that Russia, despite our diplomatic efforts and despite our clear messages of economic sanctions, decided to once again invade Ukraine.

But since we have been warning against this for a long period of time, we are also taking prudent measures to prepare ourselves. That is the reason why we, over the last months and weeks, have significantly increased the presence of NATO troops in the eastern part of the Alliance. More land troops, ground forces, but also air and naval forces. In the coming days and weeks, they will come even more.

We will further increase, and we are increasing, our presence in the Eastern part of the Alliance and today we activated NATO's defence plans that gives our military commanders more authority to move forces and to deploy forces when needed, and of course this could also be elements of the NATO Response Force. So we are ready, we are adjusting our posture, but what we do is defensive, is measured and we do not seek confrontation. We want to prevent a conflict and any attack against any NATO allied country.

(Inaudible follow up question from reporter)

Well, we have reached out to Russia for weeks and months and what we have seen is that the Russian message has been that they actually have never taken these talks seriously. Because while we were trying to find a political solution, they were planning for this invasion. While we were trying to find a political solution, they were actually day by day, week by week, increasing their military presence and readiness on the borders of Ukraine, and now the launched invasion. Russia has shut the door to a political solution. We regret that, but that's sadly the reality, which has severe and very serious consequences for the people of Ukraine, but also actually impacts the security for all of us. And that's the reason why we step up our presence in eastern part of the Alliance.

NATO Spokesperson: FAZ.

Thomas Gutschker (FAZ): Thanks a lot for taking the question. Secretary General, I have actually two questions. The first one I'd like to hear your reaction to what President Putin said this morning when he announced the military operations. He said that any country that interferes with them would face consequences greater than you have seen in your history, which I take as a veiled threat with a nuclear attack. So please, what is your response to that? He did not specify what interference means. And the second question, very simple; can the NATO Russia Founding Act be upheld under these circumstances? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General: The threatening rhetoric by President Putin and the aggressive actions by Russia, of course is the reason why we are saying that we're now faced with a new normal for our security.

We need to consult closely all allies, and we will also do that tomorrow when the leaders meet at the virtual Summit. What does this mean for our longer-term relationship with Russia? How shall we continue to defend and protect Allies in this new security reality? How can we make sure that we uphold the values we believe in; freedom, democracy, faced with a more aggressive authoritarian regime in Moscow? A regime which is willing to openly contest our values and to threat and actually also to use force to try to coerce other nations. This will have some long term effects on our security, on how we respond, on how NATO is reacting and also on how our relationship with Russia can evolve.

We don't have all the answers today, but there will be a new reality, it will be in New Europe after the invasion we saw today. Therefore I welcome the fact that we are so closely coordinating, so closely working together in NATO. We stood together in warning against the Russian aggression, the plans, we stood together in reaching out to Russia and tried to prevent the attack and now we need to stand together in responding to the attack and that's exactly what we are doing. That was the first question the second question?

(Inaudible question from reporter).

Well, that's part of this new reality we have to look into, and there will be a different reality and we need to respond but this is not the day to draw the conclusions. We will have an important discussion among leaders tomorrow.

NATO Spokesperson: NRK.

Simen Ekern (NRK): Thank you for the question. Mr. Secretary General, today Ukraine has called on Turkey to close the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles straits for Russian vessels, is that an action that was discussed in this morning's meeting and are there other similar actions that have been discussed today?

NATO Secretary General: That was not discussed in the meeting today. Turkey is of course a NATO ally, Turkey has a special role when it comes to the Bosphorus straits. But this was not an issue in the meeting this morning.

What we discussed this morning was the need to activate the defence plans. We made the decision to activate those plans, which enables to move forces more quickly, to where they are needed. And also to agree a statement where we express a very strong condemnation of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and also announced that we are going to have a virtual NATO summit tomorrow.

NATO Spokesperson: Wall Street Journal.

Dan Michaels (The Wall Street Journal): Could you talk a little bit more about the activation of the defence plan? What exactly does this change? And when was the last time this was done? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General: These plans are plans we have developed over the years to make sure that we have plans in place to react to crisis like the crisis we are faced with now. They are defensive plans. They are prudent plans and they are plans that covers the whole east of our Alliance; from the Bering Sea down to the Mediterranean and they give our military commanders some more authorities within politically defined guidelines and frameworks to deploy forces where they deem it needed and that's exactly what we have agreed today. These again are defensive plans, ensuring that we have forces at sufficient readiness at the right places throughout Europe.

NATO Spokesperson: Associated Press.

WSJ reporter intervenes with a follow up question: Have they ever been activated before?

I don't know whether it's right for me to answer that question, because I don't know whether it has been made public before, so I only said that we activated them today.

NATO Spokesperson: Associated Press.

Mark Carlson (Associated Press): Is the NATO Response Force inside Ukraine right now?

NATO Secretary General: No, there are no NATO combat troops inside Ukraine at all. We have made it clear that we do not have any plans and intentional deploying NATO troops to Ukraine. What we have made clear is that we have already increased and we are increasing the presence of NATO troops in the Eastern part of the Alliance on NATO territory.

Ukraine is a highly valued partner. We have supported Ukraine for many, many years. We helped them to build a more modern capable armed force. Militarily, we have helped them to train equip, and in many different ways to strengthen their armed forces. We helped them with cyber defences with NATO Allies in different ways. But we don't have NATO troops in Ukraine, and we don't have any plans to send NATO troops into Ukraine. But we are there to protect and defend all NATO Allies. So we support Ukraine. We provide absolute security guarantees for NATO Allies. And we demonstrate that commitment by increasing the presence in the Eastern part of the Alliance.

NATO Spokesperson: We will try to take a couple of questions online before we come back to the Press Room. We will go to Steven Erlanger from New York Times.

Steven Erlanger (New York Times): spill over Thank you, Secretary General, two quick questions. One, does NATO still have military deconfliction contacts with Russian forces today, are those ongoing? And secondly, a lot of NATO countries are going to want to keep supplying weapons to Ukraine. Do you foresee this as a major risk of a NATO-Russia conflict? And where else do you see risk of conflict now between Russia and NATO countries that could spill over into something worse? Thank you, Sir.

NATO Secretary General: We have increased the presence in Eastern part of the Alliance and we have activated NATO defence plans today to make sure that we do not see any spill over to NATO territory. Because as long as Russia knows that an attack on a NATO Ally will trigger a response from the whole Alliance, they will not attack because we are the strongest Alliance in history and as long as we stand together and make clear that we are committed by our collective defence commitments. That is the best way to prevent any attack, any spill over from the tragedy, the heinous attack we see in Ukraine, a spill over onto any NATO Allied country.

NATO Allies have provided support to Ukraine in many different ways over the last years. Especially since 2014, NATO has helped them with cyber defences, we have also helped them with some different trust funds, with different activities and then on top of that, with different capacity building measures to help them to strengthen, including their naval forces and other elements of their armed forces. But then on top of what NATO has done, as an Alliance, NATO Allies have also provided military equipment, including defensive weapons and other types of support and training. It will be a national decision in what way Allies continue to provide support. So that is for individual NATO Allies to decide. Deconfliction is extremely important for us. There has been contacts between our military commanders and Russia. We will continue to reach out to them to make sure that we do everything we can to ensure deconfliction.

NATO Spokesperson: We will next go to Helsingin Sanomat - Teija Sutinen.

Teija Sutinen (Helsingin Sanomat): Yes, this is Teija Sutinen from the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat. What is your message to the Partnership countries Finland and Sweden in the situation? At least in Finland, this discussion about the possible NATO membership, is this realistic during a crisis? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General: Finland and Sweden are very close partners and I have taken careful note of the very clear message, both from Finland and Sweden. That even though they don't apply for membership now, they strongly believe that NATO should not sign any kind of agreement with Russia, based on what Russia has proposed for us to sign a legally binding agreement ending any enlargement of NATO in the future. So I have seen that Sweden and Finland state that for them this is a question of self-determination and the sovereign right to choose your own path and then potentially in the future, also to apply for NATO membership.

So for me, the very clear messages from Finland or Sweden just has underpinned how important it is that NATO Allies do not compromise on core values, including the right for every nation to choose its own path, meaning whether it wants to belong to NATO or not belong to NATO. NATO respects those decisions regardless if it's yes or no to joining NATO.

We very much value the close partnership with Finland and Sweden. It is important for NATO, it is important for Finland and Sweden. I visited Finland and Sweden this fall, together with the North Atlantic Council and we see how closely we work together, exercise together, increase our ability to operate together for interoperability, and we have very close political consultations. Therefore, I have invited Sweden and Finland to the virtual NATO Summit tomorrow. At the NATO Summit tomorrow, we will have Sweden and Finland, and the two EU presidents present showing in a way, the very strong unity with demonstration of transatlantic NATO and also our close partnership with EU, Finland and Sweden.

NATO Spokesperson: We will go to Polish Radio.

Beata Płomecka (Polish Radio): If I may, a follow up question to Terry’s question; when exactly these high readiness element of the NATO Response Force may be deployed? Is that up to the leaders if you conveyed the summit for tomorrow, thank you.

NATO Secretary General: First of all, we have already deployed thousands of troops. For instance to Poland there are more US forces, there are more forces from the United Kingdom and there are also other nations deploying more forces to Poland and also to other countries in the eastern part of the Alliance. More ships in the Baltic Sea and more planes conducting air policing and protecting our airspace. So, this is going on and there will be more forces in the east of the Alliance over the next days and weeks. This could include elements of the NATO Response Force, but the most important thing is not exactly which elements or which forces, but the most important thing for Poland and for the other allies in Eastern part of the Alliance, is that there are more NATO forces in the East and there is and there will be even more NATO forces in the East in the coming days and weeks.

NATO Spokesperson: Final question to TV2.

Elin Sørsdahl (TV2 Norway): Thank you for the question. Secretary General, you have received apparently very good intelligence in recent weeks, you have shared it, you have been open about it. Do you have any information of the Russian plans ahead?

NATO Secretary General: Our intelligence has been very precise because it has predicted the over now several months the military buildup, but also the intentions, the plans for Russia to attack Ukraine. But of course those plans could always be changed and we continue to call on Russia to change this course and to not attack. And then you saw this morning that they attacked. That was no surprise because that was exactly what our intelligence services have predicted over several months. We have shared that intelligence to mainly try to prevent Russia from attacking. We have shared intelligence not only about the military buildup, but also about all the different attempts by Russia to create a pretext, staged situations that they can use as an excuse. These absolutely false claims of genocide against Russians or the alleged sabotage actions inside Russia and so on. It is false. It is staged. But we expose those attempts because we hoped that that could reduce the risk of a military invasion.

We have seen that they have sticked to their plans, they have done as they actually planned for a long time ago. And we need to understand that throughout all these weeks and months, when they said that they had no plans of invading Ukraine, they had plans and they were not only having plans but they actually built up all these forces with one clear aim and that was to invade Ukraine. And despite that, they were telling us, and the world and the public, that we have no plans to invade Ukraine. Yes, they had plans and now we are seeing that actually they were serious about invading Ukraine all the time. Never serious about really engaging in diplomatic efforts.

What we see now is a full-fledged invasion of Ukraine from many multiple directions. We see air, land and naval forces taking part in those attacks. It's too early, we don't have a full damage assessment yet, but this is extremely serious. It's an attack on a peaceful, sovereign, independent nation. It is a war of a type and a scale that we actually thought was part of history in Europe, but now it's back in real and it's imposing enormous suffering on innocent people in Ukraine.

NATO Spokesperson: Thank you very much. This concludes this press conference. Thank you",https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_192408.htm

Good evening.

Allied leaders have just met to address the gravest threat to Euro-Atlantic security in decades.

I invited NATO’s close partners Finland, Sweden and the European Union to our summit.

Because this crisis affects us all.

Russia has shattered peace in Europe.

The people of Ukraine are fighting for their freedom in the face of Russia’s unprovoked invasion.

We deplore the tragic loss of life, enormous human suffering and destruction.

Our thoughts are with those killed, injured, and displaced.

We call on Russia to stop this senseless war.

Immediately cease its assault.

Withdraw all its forces from Ukraine.

And turn back to the path of dialogue.

And turn away from aggression.

The Kremlin’s objectives are not limited to Ukraine.

Russia has demanded legally binding agreements to renounce further NATO enlargement.

And to remove troops and infrastructure from Allies that joined after 1997.

We are facing a new normal in European security.

Where Russia openly contests the European security order.

And uses force to pursue its objectives.

The world will hold Russia and Belarus accountable for their actions.

Russia as the aggressor.

Belarus as the enabler.

President Putin’s decision to pursue his aggression against Ukraine is a terrible strategic mistake.

For which Russia will pay a severe price for years to come.

NATO Allies and the European Union have already introduced significant sanctions.

And many of our partners around the globe have joined us.

We must stand ready to do more.

Even if it means we have to pay a price,

Because we are in this for the long haul.

At the same time, the Russian people must know:

that the Kremlin’s war on Ukraine will not make Russia more secure.

It will not make Russia more respected in the world.

It will not lead to a better future for your children.

In response to Russia’s massive military build-up over the past months,

we have already strengthened our deterrence and defence.

Yesterday, NATO Allies activated our defence plans.

And as a result, we are deploying elements of the NATO Response Force.

On land, at sea, and in the air.

To further strengthen our posture.

And to respond quickly to any contingency.

The United States, Canada and European Allies have deployed thousands of more troops to the eastern part of the Alliance.

We have over 100 jets at high alert operating in over 30 different locations.

And over 120 ships from the High North to the Mediterranean.

Including three strike carrier groups.

There must be no space for miscalculation or misunderstanding.

We will do what it takes to protect and defend every Ally.

And every inch of NATO territory.

Leaders today also made clear that we must continue our support to Ukraine.

The Kremlin is trying to make NATO and the EU provide less support to our partners.

So our collective answer must be more support.

To countries like Georgia, Moldova, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

To help them succeed with their democratic reforms,

and pursue the path that they have freely choosen.

More than ever, this crisis demonstrates the importance of North America and Europe standing together in NATO.

There is no security in Europe without a strong transatlantic bond.

With that, I’m ready to take your questions.

NATO Spokesperson: Al Jazeera.

James Bays (Al Jazeera): How fearful are you about the possible fall of Kyiv? How long in your estimate, in your estimation, can the government of Ukraine last? And if we move to a resistance, insurgency type situation, what support can NATO then give?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: So what we see now is a full-fledged invasion of Ukraine from multiple directions, with air, sea and land capabilities. And this is actually in line with what our intelligence services predicted over a long period of time because we saw the build-up around Ukraine with air, sea and land forces.

We see, of course, that they're moving towards Kyiv. We also see the rhetoric, the messages, which is strongly indicating that the aim is to change government, to change and remove the democratically elected government in Kyiv. We are in close contact with the government of Ukraine.

We are of course monitoring the situation very closely.

It is still a fluid situation. What we have seen is that the Ukrainian forces are fighting bravely and are actually able to inflict damage on the invading Russian forces.

But again, it is a very fluid and an evolving situation. NATO Allies expressed at the Summit today that they provide support to Ukraine. They are ready to continue to provide support to Ukraine. Military support, financial support, humanitarian support. And then, I think we will have to judge how things evolve. But the message from NATO Leaders, and also from Finland, Sweden, the EU, is that we are there to support Ukraine. We have supported Ukraine for many years and we continue to provide support.

NATO Spokesperson: We go to the National News Agency of Ukraine.

Dmytro Shkurko (National News Agency of Ukraine): Secretary General, in the current situation, which we observe now in Ukraine, does NATO preserve its desire to assist Ukraine with defensive equipment? In particular, can we expect that NATO will provide Ukraine with so badly needed anti-aircraft equipment? Thank you so much.

NATO Secretary General: So NATO Allies continue to provide support to Ukraine. And it was actually at the meeting today, at the NATO Summit with EU and Finland and Sweden, Allies announced and also informed all the Allies about the type of weapons, the type of support. And some of that also includes air defence systems. So NATO Allies have and continue to provide support militarily, but also different types of equipment to Ukraine.



Then, we all realize that, of course, in this very evolving and difficult situation, it's hard to predict what will be the… what are the possibilities in the future. But Allies are providing support and are very committed to continue to provide support.

NATO Spokesperson: Okay, we'll go to NBC, just behind the cameras.

Josh Lederman (NBC): Thank you Mr. Secretary General, there's concern that NATO could get pulled into this conflict if Russia were to shut down electricity or other services in Ukraine that could spill over into Poland or Romania. Can you say explicitly whether a Russian cyber attack of that nature would trigger an Article 5 collective defence?

NATO Secretary General: So we are sending a very clear message to Russia that we provide support to our partner, Ukraine. Allies provide many different types of support. NATO helps Ukraine also with their cyber defences.

But then, for NATO Allies, we provide the absolute security guarantees under the Washington Treaty Article 5. An attack on one will be regarded as an attack on all. And we are clear on this distinction because it is important to make sure that we don't have an even bigger crisis in Europe where Russia challenge, or is threatening, or attacking any NATO allied country. And that's reason why we so clearly send the message that we are there to protect all Allies and every inch of NATO territory.

When it comes to cyber attacks and the risk for incidents and accidents, for instance, in the Black Sea, we are pursuing mechanisms of de-confliction to prevent that from happening.

We have, NATO Allies, especially the United States have done that, for instance, in Syria over a long period of time.

And we, of course, are very focused. I spoke with SACEUR, the NATO Supreme Commander on that issue recently. And he is very focused on the need to de-conflict to make sure that we don't have incidents or accidents that can spiral and get out of control and create a very dangerous situation.

On cyber, well we have stated that cyber attacks can trigger Article 5. But we have never gone into the position where we give a potential adversary the privilege of defining exactly when we trigger Article 5.

We are focused on strengthening our cyber defences. We are very much aware of that that’s a risk. And therefore, we are stepping up. Both the protection of our cyber networks but also providing support to Ukraine. And we are very focused on the need for de-confliction.

NATO Spokesperson: Okay, we'll go to NPR/Deutsche Welle

Teri Schultz (NPR/Deutsche Welle):Thank you. I want to know more about the deployment of the NRF forces, please. How many will be sent? Where? From where? How long will it take to get there, thinking about military mobility, as always. And also what has changed in your calculation about the threat to NATO territory that has led Allies to make the decision to deploy this for the first time in history, for the purposes of collective defence? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General: Well, what has changed over the last days is of course that there is a full-fledged invasion of a partner, country that borders several NATO allied countries.

And this is the most serious security crisis we have faced in Europe for decades. And therefore, we have the high readiness force, we have the NATO Response Force. And that's the reason why we are deploying it to, again, prevent any miscalculation and a misunderstanding that we are not ready to protect and defend all Allies.

And of course, this is something all Allies have agreed to do. 30 Allies agreed. But of course, especially those in the eastern part of the Alliance, are extremely concerned. They are close to this, the fighting in Ukraine. And they also border Russia. And they have seen not only the military build-up and the ongoing war in Ukraine, but also seen the very threatening rhetoric. Because this goes far beyond Ukraine. This is about how Russia is actually challenging, contesting core values for security, and demanding that NATO should withdraw all forces and infrastructure from almost half of our members.

And they have stated that if you don't do that, if we don't meet their demands, there will be, what they call, military-technical consequences. So we have to take this seriously. And that's exactly why we are now deploying the NATO Response Force, for the first time in an collective defence context.

And we speak about thousands of troops. We speak about air and maritime capabilities. They are only actually part of the standing naval groups. We have many planes operating in the eastern part of the Alliance. And then, several Allies have partly already assigned troops and forces to the NATO Response Force.

We have the lead elements which are led by France. We have the United States which has assigned thousands of troops to the NATO Response Force. And these will be deployed to different places in eastern part of the Alliance.

[Follow-up question inaudible]

NATO Secretary General: Well, they are, partly, they are coming from the United States, but these are also very much European troops.

For instance, the lead element, the VJTF - the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force, is now led by France, there is a strong German component there and other Allies also part of that.

NATO Spokesperson: Associated Press.

Lorne Cook (Associated Press): Just to follow up on that, Secretary General. The VJTF can only go to one place and you have eight Allies that are extremely nervous. I mean, where might you send it? Have you identified a particular weakness on that eastern flank? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General: Well, I think we have to understand that we have many elements, components, of the NATO Response Force. We have increased the readiness of the NATO Response Force. And then, I don't speak only about that lead element, or the VJTF - the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force, but we speak about more elements than just that one.

Second, we have Allies, the United States, but also United Kingdom and other Allies that have increased readiness or forces that are assigned to NATO and the NATO Response Force.

So of course these are additional forces that we can deploy as part of the broader deployment of the NATO Response Force. I'm not saying that we are deploying the whole force. The size of the NATO Response Force has been tripled since 2014, to roughly 40,000 troops.

I'm not saying we're deploying the whole thing. I'm saying that we are deploying elements, elements of the lead…, the VJTF, and elements of the rest of the NATO Response Force.



And then, it is for SACEUR to make final decisions exactly where the different elements are deployed. But we activated the defence plans yesterday. And now the elements of this force will be deployed, or is being deployed.

NATO Spokesperson: Okay. We'll go to TV2. Lady in white, over there.

Elin Sørsdahl (TV2 Norway): Thanks. I'll just follow up on AP and what Teri from NPR said, how quick can these troops and this force be deployed?

NATO Secretary General: Well, some of these forces are already operating, because we have sea and air forces, which are also already part of the NATO maritime forces operating from the Barents Sea down to the Mediterranean. Some are air forces, the air component of the NATO Response Force. And then some of the land forces are… also can move within a few days. Because they're part of either the lead element, which has already high readiness, or the other elements that has been put on high readiness. So we speak about days and some are already operating, because we have increased our presence already.

NATO Spokesperson: Okay, we'll try to take a couple of questions online. We'll go first to Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Thomas Gutschker.

Thomas Gutschker (FAZ): Thanks a lot. Good afternoon. Secretary General, in the statement that has just been released, it is said that Russia's actions are a flagrant rejection of the principles enshrined in the NATO-Russia Founding Act. And then, it continues it is Russia that has walked away from its commitments under the Act. Does that mean that NATO now considers the NATO-Russia Founding Act as obsolete? Or do NATO member states still, are they still bound, do they still feel bound by this document? Thanks a lot.

NATO Secretary General: NATO leaders decided today a statement where it clearly states the fact that Russia has walked away. The NATO-Russia Founding Act is based on some core principles enshrined in the Founding Act. And that is the respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty of all countries, including, of course, Ukraine. And this has been violated not once, but twice. And actually it has been constantly violated since 2014, with the illegal annexation of Crimea, and the continued presence of Russian forces and Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, in Donbass. And this is further violated with the full-fledged invasion of Ukraine that we have seen over the last couple of days.

So what we have, what we see is that Russia shows no respect for the NATO-Russia Founding Act. And, of course, if you have a Founding Act between two partners, NATO and Russia, and one part doesn't respect that agreement, the agreement doesn't work. It doesn't function. It doesn't help us to improve our relationship with Russia. Because even if the Founding Act has good provisions and good intentions, if these intentions and the provisions under the Founding Act is not respected, it doesn't work. So that's the reality. The NATO-Russia Founding Act doesn't work, because one side, Russia, has violated over many years. But now we see an extremely blatant and flagrant violation of the Founding Act with the invasion of Ukraine.

NATO Spokesperson: We'll take the next question online also from Greg Palkot from FOX.

Greg Palkot (FOX News): Thank you, Oana. Thank you, Mr Secretary General. Two quick questions. One about war. One about peace. Do you agree with some reports of intelligence officials, that Kyiv could fall within the next say, day or two? And despite the bravery of the fighting that you have cited among Ukrainian soldiers, do you see a defeat inevitable if war goes on? And the quick question about peace, there is discussion, President Zelenskyy offering to discuss with Russia an approach to peace that might include neutrality for Ukraine. Would you agree to something like that? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General: So first, on the situation on the ground, it is a full invasion of Ukraine. They are moving towards Kyiv. And the stated goal is to change the government of Ukraine. It is a very unpredictable situation. Therefore, I will not speculate, but I will pay my respect to the Ukrainian armed forces, which are really proving their bravery and their courage by fighting and standing up against the much larger invading Russian force. On potential talks between the government of Ukraine, President Zelenskyy and Russia, my main message is that this is for President Zelenskyy and the government of Ukraine to decide. What we need to see now is that Russia stop the attack against Ukraine. That they withdraw their forces and cease all the attacks on Ukraine. That's the easiest, the fastest, and the best way to peace. So if they want peace, then, it is just stop to attack Ukraine. And, therefore, we call on Russia to do exactly that.

NATO Spokesperson: Okay we’ll go to NTV.

Gul Sonomut (NTV): Secretary General two short questions. First, you are a statistician and so far with regard the risk, you have already evaluate the risk and the threat against NATO coming from Russia. Particularly you foresee the playbook of Russia. And so, my first question is, what is the risk that this conflict spread? Where and what might be the end goal of Russia?

And my second question is, you have at the top of your… the tip of your fingers, the security of one billion citizen in the transatlantic area. So you met with, on VTC with all the leaders, can you reassure the public opinion that if there is a genuine threat coming from… because the rhetoric… the aggressive rhetoric of Russia, its behaviour isn’t acceptable that all member states are committed to defend and protect every single centimetre of NATO. Thank you.

NATO Secretary General: In the meeting today with NATO leaders, it was a very strong message of unity. A very strong message of resolve, that we need to stand together not only in words, but also in deeds. So we agreed a strong statement, calling on Russia to stop the attacks on Ukraine, to withdraw its forces. But, also, we agreed to continue to provide support to Ukraine, and also continue to strengthen our presence in eastern part Alliance, to prevent any attack on any NATO allied country. We have a defensive presence in the East. We are increasing our presence. Not to provoke a conflict, but to prevent a conflict. And as long as there is no doubt about NATO's readiness to protect and defend all Allies. And our commitment to the core message, the core task of NATO, one for all, all for one. An attack on one Ally will be regarded as an attack on all, then no Ally will be attacked. And that will prevent a conflict, and that will preserve peace for NATO Allies, and for one billion people.

And that's the reason why we communicate so clearly. And that's reason why we are deploying more troops in the eastern part Alliance, to make sure that there is no possibility to misunderstand our readiness to protect and defend all Allies. And, again, this is to preserve peace, to prevent an attack. And to prevent that the war which is going on in Ukraine spill over to any NATO allied country. And that was the message from NATO leaders today. And that was also the message when I met with many of them in the G7 yesterday. And that is also of course the message when we speak to close partners, Finland, Sweden, and the European Union. Because we all are concerned and Russia's attack on Ukraine is more than an attack on Ukraine. It's a devastating horrendous attack on innocent people in Ukraine. But it's also an attack on the whole European security order. And that's the reason why we take it so extremely seriously.

NATO Spokesperson: Deutsche Welle.

Alexandra von Nahmen (Deutsche Welle): Thank you. Secretary General, one question on Ukraine's request for Turkey to close the Bosphorus for Russian warships. Is that… was that discussed today? And one follow-up on the question just asked, we heard today from the Lithuanian Foreign Minister saying that when we lose Ukraine today we will be fighting for NATO later. Would you say that statement is exaggerated? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General: On the Bosphorus, that was not an issue. On the potential attack, or any potential attack on a NATO allied country, well that has been my message throughout the whole day. That was the message from the NATO leaders in the Summit today, is that we are there to protect and defend all Allies. NATO is the strongest military Alliance in the world. And make no mistake, we are there to protect and defend all Allies, and every inch of NATO territory. And we convey that message again and again. Both in words, but also in deeds. And that's the way to prevent war. That's the way to prevent an attack, to preserve peace. And we have done so for more than 70 years. And we will continue to do it also in the light of the attack on Ukraine.

NATO Spokesperson: Thank you very much. This concludes this press conference.

Thank you so much Prime Minister, dear Mark, thank you so much for your kind words and also for your strong leadership and personal commitment to our Alliance, and it is great to be here with you all online.

Let me also thank to the Netherlands and Germany for co-hosting this important seminar today.

And I am delighted that former NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer is joining these discussions today.

Let me also thank Canada, Italy, Portugal, and Spain,

and our partners Finland and Sweden,

for co-sponsoring this event.

This is the third in a series of four seminars,

to help prepare our next Strategic Concept.

And this seminar focuses, as you mentioned, on partnerships.

***

Today we are facing the most dangerous moment in European security for a generation.

Our highly valued partner, Ukraine, remains under imminent threat from Russia.

NATO Allies are united in their full support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders.

We will continue to provide Ukraine with strong political, practical and financial support.

To help Ukraine build their defence capabilities,

modernise their defence and security institutions,

and uphold their right to self-defence,

which is enshrined in the UN Charter.

Many NATO Allies also provide important bilateral support to Ukraine.

And I welcome the recent decision by the Dutch government to provide military equipment to Ukraine to defend itself.

***

There is much at stake in today’s crisis.

The risk of conflict is real.

Russia is using force and ultimatums.

Not only to redraw borders in Europe.

But to try to re-write the entire global security architecture.

Moscow is challenging fundamental principles for our security.

Like NATO’s right to protect and defend all Allies.

And the right for every nation to choose their own path.

This is not only about Ukraine and Georgia.

It is also about denying other European countries,

like Finland and Sweden,

their freedom to choose.

Finland and Sweden are two highly-valued partners bordering the Baltic sea,

with whom we cooperate closely.

In joint exercises, operations and political dialogue.

The crisis in Ukraine underlines the importance of cooperating with our partners.

To defend our shared values and security.

Not least with the European Union.

We are working closely together on the current crisis.

I speak regularly with my EU counterparts.

And NATO Allies,

including Canada, the United States and United Kingdom,

are coordinating with the European Union on economic sanctions.

As we saw very clearly yesterday.

NATO and the European Union are two sides of the same coin.

We have different roles, remits and membership.

But what we do is complementary.

So while the EU is strengthening all the tools in its toolbox in respect to the current crisis,

NATO has enhanced our deterrence and defence across the Alliance.

With more troops, ships and planes.

We have significantly increased our military presence in the east of the Alliance.

And we are ready to do even more.

I welcome, as you said Mark, that the Netherlands has increased the readiness of its forces for the NATO Response Force.

It is sending more troops to our multinational battlegroup in Lithuania.

And more fighter jets to Bulgaria.

This shows that the Netherlands is a highly valued and very committed NATO ally.

Beyond the current crisis, NATO and the EU are cooperating in many other areas.

From cyber security,

to stability in the Western Balkans,

and maritime issues in the Aegean.

We have lifted NATO-EU cooperation to unprecedented levels in recent years.

And our ambition is to go even further.

In new areas like resilience,

emerging technologies,

and the security impact of climate change.

The Netherlands has been a key driver of closer NATO-EU cooperation,

including on military mobility.

And I thank you, Prime Minister Rutte, for that.

***

NATO’s partnerships are fundamental to our ability to preserve peace,

promote stability,

and increase security for all.

They are a two-way street.

That help us all adapt to a more contested and competitive world.

Over the last three decades, NATO has built a broad network of partnerships.

With countries and organisations,

near and far.

From Finland and Sweden,

to Colombia and Mauritania.

And from the Mediterranean,

to the Asia Pacific region.

After the fall of the Berlin Wall,

NATO’s partnerships helped spread freedom, democracy and security throughout Europe.

Since the 1990s, NATO’s operational partners have helped increase stability beyond our borders.

And NATO’s partnerships remain essential,

as we continue to adapt to a more dangerous and competitive world today.

We also work with many other partners, for example, with Iraq.

And our partners in the Middle East and North Africa.

To stabilise our neighbourhood.

And fight international terrorism.

Through our NATO 2030 agenda and next Strategic Concept,

we are significantly stepping up our training and capacity-building support to partners.

In areas like counter-terrorism, crisis management, peacekeeping, and defence reforms.

We also want to deepen our existing partnerships,

and develop new ones.

To work with likeminded countries to address the security implications of a more competitive world.

Ladies and gentlemen,

We are faced with a new normal.

A world of rising strategic competition.

And increasing challenges to our security.

Where authoritarian powers are seeking to re-write the global rulebook.

And demonstrate that might is right.

So we face a fundamental question.

About the world we want to live in.

One where big powers dictate what others do, through aggression and ultimatums.

Or a world where everyone is free to choose their own path.

Able to live in freedom and democracy.

This is the world we want.

And the one we are working for.

We are stronger and safer when we stand together.

Thank you so much.",https://www.nato.int/cps/fr/natohq/opinions_192377.htm

4,31efb2c9-aa04-421f-bbac-74b472f94c48,[],,"Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe is marking its 70th anniversary this year and we are celebrating with an in-depth look into the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). We will journey back in time to the very beginning of the Alliance and week-by-week give you a new window into this Transatlantic-multinational organisation.





The Power of NATO

The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) is known throughout the globe as the world's strongest and most powerful Alliance; but where does NATO's power come from? Does the organisation have its own military forces or NATO troops? Simply put, no and yes. The Alliance counts on the military might of its 30 Allied and partner nations to support missions and operations around the world.



NATO doesn't have its own armed forces, but it has a permanent, integrated military command structure, comprised of both military and civilian personnel, from all member states. These staffs work collectively to achieve the same objectives.

While we may not have a NATO military, the Alliance benefits from being able to count on the military capabilities and expertise of each member country. Every nation brings something to the table including personnel, but also tanks, submarines even fighter jets.

Since 1949, NATO has increased its collective military power. Today it has the capability to count on nearly 3.5-million personnel, troops and civilian combined. Each member state agrees to contribute with different strategic weight and influence.

Allied Command Operations (ACO) led by Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), is responsible for executing all NATO operations and missions, Deputy SACEUR coordinates troop contributions. When an operation or mission ends, multinational forces return to their respective countries.

When the North Atlantic Council (NAC) decides to carry out an operation, mission or exercise, NATO's military authorities propose a draft concept of operations (called CONOPS) that presents the minimum request of forces they are demanding in terms of equipment, work force and resources. This process is called force generation.

The force generation process follows a standard procedure; this task involves Allied Command Operations, Force Generation Branch and National Military Representatives (NMRs). According to this procedure every Ally allocates the personnel and equipment necessary to carry out NAC approved operations and missions. National availability of founding is the final deciding factor on whether a nation will contribute or not.

Member countries make direct and indirect contributions to the costs of running NATO and implementing its policies and activities. One critical part of these contributions is indirect and comes through the Allies' participation in NATO-led operations.

Member countries cover the costs involved whenever they volunteer forces to participate in a NATO operation. For example, the cost for providing a fighter jet lies with the nation that makes it available. Allies in accordance with an agreed cost-sharing formula based on relative Gross National Income make direct contributions to NATO's common budgets. These contributions finance the costs of NATO's integrated structures, collectively owned equipment, such as the Airborne Warning and Control Systems (AWACS).

A recent statistic shows the number of NATO military personnel involved in operations and missions around the world: approximately 20,000 managing often complex ground, air and naval operations in a myriad of environments. NATO is leading operations in Afghanistan, Kosovo, Iraq, the Mediterranean and more.

The Alliance is also ensuring a strong-cohesive battle with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic by transporting medical personnel and critical supplies, helping with construction of field hospitals to host patients affected by COVID and providing support for local authorities where NATO troops are deployed. NATO is always on the first line in response to global crises and disasters.

Speaking after chairing a NATO summit, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the 30-nation organization will send parts of the NATO Response Force and elements of a quickly deployable spearhead unit to the alliance’s eastern flank. It’s the first time the force has been used to defend NATO allies.

Stoltenberg did not say how many troops would be sent or where they might go, but he did confirm that the move would involve land, sea and air power.

In response to Europe’s biggest security crisis in decades, Stoltenberg said, “We are now deploying the NATO Response Force for the first time in a collective defense context. We speak about thousands of troops. We speak about air and maritime capabilities.”

The NRF can number up to 40,000 troops, but Stoltenberg said that NATO would not be deploying the entire force. Parts of a spearhead unit known in NATO jargon as the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force, which is currently led by France, will also be sent.

The announcement came after NATO members, ranging from Russia’s neighbor Estonia in the north down around the west of conflict-hit Ukraine to Bulgaria on the Black Sea coast, triggered urgent consultations Thursday about their security amid concerns from the invasion.

“We will continue to take all measures and decisions required to ensure the security and defense of all allies,” the leaders said in a statement. “We will make all deployments necessary to ensure strong and credible deterrence and defense across the alliance, now and in the future.”

The world’s biggest security organization previously had around 5,000 troops stationed in the Baltic countries — Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — and Poland, but has significantly beefed up its defenses over the past three months.

Some of NATO’s 30 member countries are supplying arms, ammunition and other equipment to Ukraine, but NATO as an organization isn’t. It won’t launch any military action in support of Ukraine, which is a close partner but has no prospect of joining.

The Baltic members, however, have said the West should “urgently provide Ukrainian people with weapons, ammunition and any other kind of military support to defend itself as well as economic, financial and political assistance and support, humanitarian aid.”

NATO began beefing up its defenses in northeastern Europe after Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014.

Recently, some members have also sent troops, aircraft and warships to the Black Sea region, near allies Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey.

Short-term, NATO has also activated an emergency planning system to allow commanders to move forces more quickly. The Pentagon said Thursday that it is sending 7,000 troops to Europe in addition to 5,000 recently deployed personnel.

NATO surveillance aircraft have begun patrols inside allied territory. The planes would be able to watch Russian fighter jet and transport movements inside Ukraine, much as they monitored aircraft in Syria from Turkey’s airspace.

NATO leaders will also hold a virtual summit on Friday. The alliance also activated NATO’s defence plans to give military commanders to move forces, including those at high readiness.

“We must respond with renewed resolve and even stronger unity,” Stoltenberg told a news conference after chairing an emergency meeting of NATO ambassadors. “What we do is defensive.”",https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-nato-stoltenberg/nato-puts-jets-on-high-alert-activates-its-defence-plans-idUKS8N2SS0CF

President Joe Biden was among the NATO heads of state who met Friday morning to coordinate the treaty organization’s next moves as Russian President Vladimir Putin pushes forward with his full assault on his western neighbor. Russian forces encircled and entered Kyiv on Friday, prompting Ukrainian citizens to take up arms and braced for an intense battle. The NATO deployment along its eastern flank also comes as the U.S. warned that Moscow’s ultimate goal is “decapitating the government” in Kyiv and establishing a Russian-backed government in Ukraine’s capital.

“President Putin has failed in his goal of dividing the West. NATO is as united and resolute as it’s ever been, and NATO will maintain its Open Door to those European states who share our values and who one day may seek to join our Alliance. As we navigate this crisis, we pledged to work even more closely together in our defense of freedom and the democratic values that imbue our Alliance with purpose and power,” the White House said in a statement.

NATO said it will continue to deploy troops as necessary to “ensure strong and credible deterrence and defence across the Alliance, now and in the future.”

”Our measures are and remain preventive, proportionate and non-escalatory,” the statement said.

Stoltenberg didn’t specify the number of troops who would be deployed in this first round but said he’s talking about “thousands of troops.” NATO’s response force, comprised of 40,000 troops, has tripled in size since 2014, the year Putin first invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea.

Biden approved the deployment of an additional 7,000 U.S. troops to Germany on Thursday, bringing the total of American forces sent to Europe to 12,000 this month. The troops will include an armored brigade combat team with “associated capabilities and enablers,” the Defense Department said Thursday. The president has repeatedly said he’s not sending American troops to fight in Ukraine, but instead that the U.S. soldiers will be in place to reassure NATO allies.

Stoltenberg also said NATO allies during Friday’s summit said they were ready to continue providing military, financial and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. Biden said he conveyed this message in a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy following the meeting.

“I commended the brave actions of the Ukrainian people who were fighting to defend their country. I also conveyed ongoing economic, humanitarian, and security support being provided by the United States as well as our continued efforts to rally other countries to provide similar assistance,” Biden said in the White House statement.",https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/25/nato-deploy-troops-eastern-flank-ukraine-00011902
