0,a3a8e7f1-d482-401b-93fc-43ed7bebb465,['Nat Parry'],,"OSCE PA President Margareta Cederfelt, Vienna, 24 February 2022VIENNA, 24 February 2022 – Referring to the Russian military operation in Ukraine as “indefensible” and a “gross violation of international law,” OSCE parliamentarians gathered in the hybrid Winter Meeting urged an immediate end to the hostilities and a return to diplomacy. Some 28 parliamentarians took the floor in an open debate, with most expressing clear opposition to the incursion and deep concern for the lives of civilians in Ukraine.

Opening the discussion, OSCE Chairman-in-Office and Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau, OSCE PA President Margareta Cederfelt, and President of the Austrian Parliament Wolfgang Sobotka reiterated the role of the OSCE in facilitating dialogue and building confidence.

In his remarks, President Sobotka said that Austria condemns Russia’s attacks on the territorial integrity of Ukraine, emphasizing that the international community can never concede that “might makes right.” The twisting of history, he said, cannot negate the right of Ukraine to its sovereignty. “Today the OSCE principles are being violated on a broad spectrum,” Sobotka said. “Our hope is that diplomatic relations should be able to turn the tide and relaunch the Minsk process.” He expressed particular support for the civilians who suffer under hostilities – the ones who suffer first and suffer the most, he said.

Foreign Minister Rau stated, “Russia’s unprovoked all-out invasion against Ukrainian cities and villages constitutes a fundamental breach of the UN Charter and Helsinki Final Act. Invoking article 51 of the UN Charter to justify this crime against humanity is deplorable and shameful. We condemn, in the strongest possible words, this act of aggression.”

“We expect the Russian side to honor its international obligations and commitments. Any sustainable, political solution must fully respect sovereignty, territorial integrity, and independence of Ukraine,” Rau underscored.

President Cederfelt stressed the OSCE PA’s steadfast support for the resolution of the conflict based on core OSCE principles such as the inviolability of frontiers and the indivisibility of security.

“The Russian military invasion of Ukraine is an armed aggression in clear and gross violation of the most basic norms of international law and OSCE principles and commitments,” President Cederfelt said. “Today more than ever, parliamentarians must exercise their oversight role, rather than enable their governments to breach international commitments. Parliaments must be tools for de-escalation, not weapons of confrontation.”

OSCE Secretary General Helga Schmid addresses the Standing Committee, 24 February 2022OSCE Secretary General Helga Schmid spoke to the OSCE PA Heads of Delegations, Bureau members, Special Representatives and Chairs of Ad Hoc Committees at the Standing Committee Meeting today. In her remarks, the Secretary General condemned, in the strongest terms, the Russian military action against Ukraine.

“It did not need to be this way. But Russia chose force over dialogue. Dialogue was offered. By the OSCE, by its Polish Chair. By others. Including NATO, the US, and European capitals. Options for dialogue were not exhausted,” Schmid said.

During the open debate in the Joint Session of the General Committees, the Head of the Ukrainian Delegation Mykyta Poturaiev described the situation that his country faces, with large-scale military operations in Ukraine’s biggest cities. He warned that if Ukraine falls, there will be no European security.

Parliamentarians from across the OSCE area expressed alarm over the current security situation, with several remarking that the recent developments represent a major threat to peace not only in Ukraine but the whole of Europe. This is a time for the Parliamentary Assembly to stand with Ukraine, it was stressed. OSCE parliamentarians underscored that the focus now must be on halting the escalation of conflict and preventing a wider war, urging a return to bilateral and multilateral dialogue. Diplomacy remains relevant, it was emphasized, but sanctions were also called for as a deterrent.

Russian parliamentarian Tatiana Kusaiko said that the military operation in Ukraine is intended to protect civilians in Donbas.

President of the Austrian Parliament Wolfgang Sobotka, OSCE PA Secretary General Roberto Montella and Head of the Ukrainian Delegation Mykyta Poturaiev, Vienna, 24 February 2022The debate was held under the theme Security Guarantees and the Indivisibility of Security in Europe: Role of the OSCE.

Being held today and tomorrow in a blended format with some 50 parliamentarians gathering in-person in Vienna and many more participating online, the Winter Meeting is an opportunity for parliamentarians to interact with the governmental side and executive structures of the OSCE.

The general committees are meeting to discuss the preliminary ideas of committee rapporteurs for their reports and draft resolutions being prepared for this year’s Annual Session in Birmingham, United Kingdom. The OSCE PA’s Committee on Political Affairs and Security, chaired by United States Congressman Richard Hudson, is holding a debate this afternoon on the theme Heightened Tensions in the OSCE Area and the Need for Interparliamentary Dialogue.

Tomorrow, the OSCE PA’s committees on human rights and economic and environmental security will meet for more debates.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, in an early Thursday morning address in Moscow, announced that Russia would launch a military action in Ukraine. Soon thereafter, NBC News reported that explosions were heard in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital.

U.S. President Joe Biden condemned the attack. ""The world will hold Russia accountable,"" he said in a statement before he held a late-night call with Ukraine President Volodimyr Zelenskyy.

Stock futures in American markets plummeted as the news broke. The United Nations Security Council had just convened an emergency meeting Wednesday night.

Earlier, European and U.S. officials scrambled to penalize Russia on Wednesday, responding to its deployments of troops to eastern Ukraine with a cascade of economic sanctions.

As concerns grew that Russian aggression would escalate, Ukraine warned its citizens to avoid traveling to Russia and to leave the country immediately if they are already there. The move came after Putin said Wednesday that Moscow is ""always open"" to diplomacy, days after ordering troops into eastern Ukraine and recognizing the independence of two self-declared republics in the region.

The European Union was set to hold an emergency meeting on Thursday, and was reportedly considering another round of sanctions on Russian individuals. Officials from the United Kingdom and United States also announced or threatened more retaliatory measures after they unveiled initial tranches this week.",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/23/putin-says-russia-open-to-diplomacy-as-moscow-hit-with-fresh-sanctions.html

U.S. representatives and senators from Massachusetts had been watching the escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine all week. Some came out in full support of President Biden's plans to impose sanctions on Russia.

But as the conflict took a turn late Wednesday night and reports came of Russian military forces and Russian-backed separatists firing missiles into major cities in Ukraine, state leaders escalated their condemnation of Russia's aggression while continuing to express support for Ukraine.

Below we've compiled their public remarks about the rapidly unfolding conflict.

Sen. Ed Markey

In a series of tweets Wednesday, Markey expressed sympathy with the Ukrainian people and used the conflict to highlight ""the importance of eliminating U.S. and European reliance on Russian dirty energy,"" like oil and natural gas.

Following Thursday's attacks, Markey focused his message on uniting with Ukraine and against Russia.

Markey also weighed in on the conflict's looming humanitarian cost Thursday morning in Lynn.

""There will be refugees,"" Markey said. ""There are going to be people who are seriously harmed or killed because of this event and we have to be there to say that the United States will be your friend.""

Sen. Elizabeth Warren

Warren tweeted Tuesday in support of Biden's plans to impose sanctions against Russia, before releasing a fresh statement on the conflict late Thursday morning following the developments overnight.

Rep. Jake Auchincloss

Auchincloss predicts sanctions imposed against Russia by the United States and Western nations will be crippling to the Russian economy.

On WBUR's Radio Boston, Auchincloss said the U.S. response must go further than the sanctions imposed by President Biden Thursday.

""The sanctions are just one element we need to crush the Russian oil and gas sector,"" he said. ""Clean energy is not just an environmental issue, it's not just good economics. It is maybe the single-most important strategic asset that the West can have in the coming generation.""

The U.S. needs to wage an information campaign in the Russian homeland to show the Russian people what is really happening and to undermine Putin, Auchincloss said.

In a tweet Thursday afternoon, Auchincloss also noted a personal connection to the terror provoked by Russia's invasion.

Rep. Katherine Clark

Earlier this week, Clark joined others in calling for sanctions against Russia in response to its ""unprovoked dangerous actions against #Ukraine,"" as she wrote in a Feb. 22 tweet. In it, she went on to say, ""America and its allies abroad must use every diplomatic tool we have to stop further aggression by Putin that threatens Ukraine's sovereignty and its people.""

She tweeted Thursday the U.S. must hold Russian leaders accountable.

Rep. Bill Keating

Rep. Stephen Lynch

Lynch — who chairs the House national security subcommittee — joined WBUR's Morning Edition on Friday to discuss the situation.

He highlighted in a tweet on Thursday that Russia's attacks were a ""naked use of military force against a civilian population.""

He called on the U.S. and its allies to respond with ""condemnation in the strongest possible terms.""

Rep. Jim McGovern

McGovern posted a series of tweets, including one in which he retweeted Biden's message that ""Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring.""

McGovern focused his last tweet on the humanitarian crisis he said will ensue.

Rep. Seth Moulton

Rep. Richard Neal

In tweet Wednesday, Neal insisted on a ""diplomatic solution"" in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he described as ""a brazen aggressor, acting in dangerous ways."" In light of Thursday's attacks, Neal said, ""We cannot and will not tolerate his authoritarian regime.""

Rep. Ayanna Pressley

Pressley responded to Thursday's attacks in part by retweeting a statement by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: ""Russia's invasion of Ukraine is indefensible. The U.S. is right to impose targeted sanctions on Putin & his oligarchs. We also must work with our allies to prepare for a refugee crisis on a massive scale. Finally, any military action must take place with Congressional approval.""

Pressley also posted her own remarks Thursday morning.

Rep. Lori Trahan

Trahan emphasized in a tweet that Russia's actions were a ""violation of international law"" that would be felt for ""decades to come."" In a second tweet, she extended sympathy with the Ukrainian people while also calling on world leaders to make de-escalation a ""top priority.""",https://www.wbur.org/news/2022/02/24/massachusetts-congress-ukraine-russia-reaction

MR PRICE: Good afternoon.

QUESTION: Good afternoon.

MR PRICE: As we have noted in recent days and recent hours, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is beginning. Hours after Russia recognized the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics as, quote/unquote, “independent,” President Putin authorized Russian troops to enter those regions. He has taken other steps that amount to a direct assault on Ukraine’s sovereignty.

We responded in turn quickly and decisively. Within less than a day, we’d announced the first tranche of sanctions with our allies and partners, including those in the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, and Australia.

Our German allies, yesterday, took resolute action to ensure that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, what had been a prized $11 billion investment on the part of the Russian Federation, is suspended indefinitely. And as you have just seen, President Biden today authorized sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG and its corporate office-holders. We have now taken complementary action using our own authorities to ensure that Nord Stream 2 is off the table, just as we said it would be.

In lockstep with our allies, we are blocking from the global financial system two large banks that are connected to the Kremlin and Russian military, and Russian sovereign wealth can no longer trade on U.S. or European financial markets. As you all know, we additionally sanctioned Russian elites, those elites who are in many ways complicit.

This is the beginning of our response. If Putin escalates further, we will escalate further using additional sanctions and export controls, which we’ve yet to unveil but are fully prepared to implement with allies and partners across the globe.

The sequence of events that Secretary Blinken laid out at the UN Security Council last week appears to be proceeding exactly as he laid out. We’ve seen false flags, we’ve seen provocations, we’ve seen theatrically staged meetings at the Kremlin, we’ve seen cyber operations, and the list goes on.

So where do we go from here? Moscow needs to demonstrate that it’s serious about diplomacy. Russia’s actions over the last 48 hours have, in fact, demonstrated the opposite. If Moscow’s approach changes, we remain ready to engage.

The United States and our allies and partners remain open to diplomacy. We are eager to engage to avert what would be a brutal and costly conflict, but as we have said, diplomacy cannot succeed unless Russia changes course.

As we have said, we are prepared. We are prepared for any contingency going forward.

Matt.

QUESTION: Okay. Thanks. I have a question about the Houthi sanctions, but it’s largely semantic, so I’ll leave it ‘til later.

On Nord Stream 2, you guys had been saying for months – indeed, for over a year, since the waivers were first granted – that in fact this gave you additional leverage, withholding the sanctions did, and would serve as a deterrent. Clearly it didn’t – they didn’t provide you with any leverage at all that we can tell, because of what you just said in your opening statement about the invasion beginning. So how do you explain to people why you didn’t impose these sanctions earlier?

MR PRICE: So Matt, it’s important – and let’s just rewind the tape and remember what has happened in recent hours. Yesterday, within a short timeframe of the Russian invasion beginning, Germany took decisive, resolute action to take Nord Stream 2 off the table. Today, we followed with our own complementary authorities using the powers and capabilities that we have.

We have always said in the context of Nord Stream 2, in the context of the steps that we are taking with partners and allies around the world, that one of the most important tools we have in our arsenal is transatlantic unity. The fact that Germany acted so quickly, so decisively, is in many ways a product of the coordination of the consultation we have done now with two successive German governments. Of course, this started with Chancellor Merkel and her government, and in more recent months we have had concerted discussions with Chancellor Scholz and his government.

The fact that we are acting in unison immediately to take these steps that essentially remove Nord Stream 2 from the equation – that is a byproduct, that is a result of the work that we have done together with the German Government over the course of these last several months, over the course of the last year or so.

QUESTION: So it sounds to me – and correct me if I’m wrong – that your argument is that if you had imposed the sanctions earlier, the Germans wouldn’t have suspended – done – the Germans wouldn’t have done what they did yesterday, or it would have been a much bigger lift to get them to do that.

MR PRICE: What we have said, and our – what —

QUESTION: (Off-mike.)

MR PRICE: Our strategy has been predicated on the knowledge that transatlantic unity is the most powerful instrument we have.

QUESTION: That’s fine, but I don’t – but look, the pipeline’s already been built, okay? Now, whether it gets turned on or not is another —

MR PRICE: Well, but —

QUESTION: — is another question.

MR PRICE: Right. So you —

QUESTION: But presumably you had more leverage – and I don’t understand why you don’t think that you would have had more leverage if it hadn’t been – if these sanctions had been imposed before the pipeline was finished.

MR PRICE: So, Matt, you also raise a good point. The pipeline, when this administration came into office, was more than 90 percent complete. We have imposed sanctions under PEESA on a number of targets associated with this pipeline, persons and entities. But the fact is that had we sanctioned Nord Stream 2 AG, had we sanctioned its corporate office holders, it is far from clear that that would have kept the pipeline from going into operation. What the Germans did yesterday was to ensure that the pipeline is no longer part of the equation.

QUESTION: Right.

MR PRICE: So by acting together with the Germans how we did, when we did, and the way in which we did, we have ensured that this is an $11 billion prize investment that is now a hunk of steel sitting at the bottom of the sea.

QUESTION: All right, well, I don’t think you, though, can prove – and the converse can’t be proven either. But you just don’t know if imposing the sanctions earlier would have had more of a deterrent effect or any deterrent effect —

MR PRICE: Well, if we would have made it a sunk cost many, many months ago for the Russian Federation, I don’t think that would have had much deterrent capability.

QUESTION: Well, it hasn’t anyway, so I’ll leave it there.

MR PRICE: Simon.

QUESTION: Yeah, the Secretary obviously said yesterday he had canceled his meeting with Foreign Minister Lavrov, but you guys remain open to diplomacy. So what exactly would you want to see from Russia in order to reschedule that meeting, in order to resume some kind of diplomacy, diplomatic talks between you? And just an additional one: You’ve sort of – this is the last – or this is part of the first tranche of sanctions, the Nord Stream 2 sanctions that just came out. Is that the end of the first tranche or is there more coming in that? And can you say whether more sanctions actions will be taken if Russia doesn’t escalate further from where it is now?

MR PRICE: Well, the question you ask is what we would like to see. Let me tell you – let me start by answering that question by letting you know what we no longer will engage in, and that is the pretense of diplomacy. You heard the Secretary use that phrase yesterday, and that is what we have seen. This is and has been, in some ways, diplomatic kabuki theater on the part of the Russians – making statements that they are committed to a diplomatic path while their actions suggest exactly the opposite. That is not an environment in which diplomacy can achieve the results that it needs to achieve.

Our goal here, even as the Russian invasion of Ukraine is beginning, is to avert the worst-case scenario, the worst-case scenario that we have warned about for some time now. And we have gone into great detail in terms of what that could look like: electronic warfare; the – a fuller-scale invasion, an attack on major urban centers, including Kyiv, a city of 2.9 million people; horrific human rights abuses, atrocities, potential war crimes. These are all things that, even as the invasion is beginning, we are going to do everything that we reasonably can to prevent from happening.

And so that’s why, together with our allies and partners, we absolutely remain open to diplomacy, but only if Moscow is serious. We are not going to engage in this pretense with them during which they draw out the process – suggest one thing, do another, ready their preparations, move their forces closer to the border, develop and refine their plans – as they give the world a head fake that they are actually committed to the diplomatic path.

Now, there are a number of ways that Moscow could indicate that it is serious. It essentially boils down to de-escalation. That would be the most concrete, the clearest indication that diplomacy has the potential to bear fruit, that diplomacy has the potential to save lives. That is the kind of diplomacy we are interested in. That is also not the kind of diplomacy that we have seen any indication, as of yet, that Moscow is interested in.

Vivian.

QUESTION: Can you comment on the reports that the U.S. informed the Ukrainian Government that an attack could happen as soon as tonight and that Kharkiv is possibly in the line of attack, that it could be directly – that the Russian troops could roll over the border and attack Kharkiv tonight?

MR PRICE: What I’ll say about those reports is they are entirely consistent with what we have been saying for some time now: that Russia has amassed forces along Ukraine’s borders, in Belarus; positioned the assets, the heavy weaponry, the soldiers, the service members it would need to undertake an invasion of Ukraine at a moment’s notice. That has been true for some time now.

So for several days now, we have said the invasion is potentially imminent, meaning it could start today. It could start tomorrow; it could start next week. What we haven’t seen is – and this goes back to Simon’s question – is any indication that the Russians are backing away from this. We have not seen any data points that alleviate the grave concern, the profound concern that we’ve been expressing for some time yet – some time now. So the invasion remains potentially imminent, and Moscow is poised to do precisely the kinds of things that you just outlined.

QUESTION: Can I just follow up real quickly also on something Simon said, that you and Simon discussed? With this notion of diplomacy still on the table and now you’re saying that it’s possible that – Donbas is obviously being attacked if not actually, then rhetorically; that the Russians are now acknowledging or recognizing their autonomy and sovereignty. So how can you then justify discussions about diplomacy when this is underway? I mean, you keep on saying that the Russians have to show that they’re serious. They have to de-escalate. But could they pause things right now and possibly engage in talks with the U.S., or do significant sort of scale-back have to happen? Do we have to see troops falling back before that’s discussed? Is Donbas being regarded differently from the rest of the country?

MR PRICE: So you heard from our colleagues at the White House and others here over the course of the day yesterday, including the Secretary, that the invasion is beginning. And when we spoke about the beginning of the invasion, we talked about several developments over the course of that 24-hour period: Vladimir Putin’s recognition of the so-called DNR and LNR; the order that he conveyed to the ministry of defense to deploy forces into the Donbas; the authorization that he sought to send Russian servicemembers into service extraterritorially; the rhetorical assault, essentially, that we saw President Putin deliver against Ukraine denying Ukraine its sovereignty and, essentially, its right to exist. Those are what we’ve seen. Those are what we’ve heard.

But as I just mentioned, there are some things – many things, in fact – that Russia is poised to do at a moment’s notice that we have not yet seen. A large-scale invasion, an assault on urban centers, the human rights abuses, the potential war crimes, the atrocities that we have great concern could take place, these are all things that we want to prevent.

So you asked the question, why would we engage in diplomacy? Well, we would engage in diplomacy to save lives. We would engage in diplomacy to prevent an all-out war. This is a war that would be brutal. It would be costly. It would be in many ways devastating for the Russian Federation, of course for the Ukrainian people. And the way in which the Russian Federation would wage this war, you heard from the National Security Advisor, it would not be a type of conflict that you might imagine over territory or over concrete ends. You heard the National Security Advisor make the case that this would be a war waged against the Ukrainian people to subjugate them, to crush them, to exact in many ways revenge.

This is what we want to prevent. So we are ready to engage, but we need a partner. We need a negotiating counterpart that demonstrates seriousness of purpose. We have not seen that from the Russian Federation; in fact, we have seen the opposite at every turn.

Andrea?

QUESTION: Ned, do we have diplomats right now in Lviv? Or are they spending their nights in Poland and going back and forth? Have we made any kind of commitment to the safe passage, to any kind of extraction, if you will, for key members of the Zelenskyy government, if necessary? And what would be our commitment to any insurgency that developed, given if it were a full-scale invasion, if any? I mean, there was training. There was support.

And one final question —

MR PRICE: I should write these down.

QUESTION: Sorry. Your reaction to former Secretary of State Pompeo and former President Trump praising Putin’s cleverness, strength, and smartness in the last couple of days?

MR PRICE: I’ll start with that one. I have no response. In fact, I have no words.

To move on to Lviv, I think what you heard from us on Sunday is that the Secretary had determined that it was in the best interests, in the best interests of the safety and security of our team on the ground, for them to temporarily relocate into Poland. They have been spending the night in Poland, but they have been regularly essentially commuting back into Lviv. Our chargé, Kristina Kvien, has been leading the team back on the ground in Lviv. We have every expectation that they will continue to do so as long as the security environment remains permissive.

When they’re on the ground in Lviv, they’re able to undertake emergency consular services to help Americans who may be seeking to leave the country. They are engaging with our Ukrainian partners, and they have important missions that they’re able to fulfill in Lviv.

But regardless of whether they’re in Lviv, whether they are in Poland, that in no way changes the commitment we have to our Ukrainian partners. It in no way diminishes the partnership we have with Kyiv. We’ve remained in constant contact with our partners in the Ukrainian Government, and that takes me to your question about any advice we may have passed on to the Zelenskyy government.

The fact is that we are in contact with our friends and counterparts in Kyiv on a daily basis. As you know, Foreign Minister Kuleba was here yesterday. The President had an opportunity to speak to President Zelenskyy over the weekend. The Secretary was in the Oval Office for that call. The president, President Zelenskyy and his team, know that they have the steadfast and unwavering support of the United States. Of course, our goal in all of this is to avert that worst-case scenario, the worst-case scenario that we’ve already talked about in the course of this briefing. The fact is that the president and his team will make decisions in the coming days best – based on the best interests of their country and their people. The foreign minister was asked a question about this just yesterday. He provided an insight into their thinking. But these will be decisions that our Ukrainian counterparts will make based on their own determinations and their own calculus.

In terms of our – let me put it this way. In terms of our continued assistance to our Ukrainian partners, the President has made very clear that in the event of a Russian invasion – which, as we have said, is beginning – we will not only continue our defensive security assistance to our Ukrainian partners, but we will double down on it. So on top of the unprecedented level of defensive security assistance that we provided to our Ukrainian partners over the last year – $650 million, including a $200 million drawdown that the President signed in December, deliveries of which continue to flow into Kyiv, flow into Ukraine I should say – we will continue – not only continue to provide that support, but we will look to further that defensive security assistance for our Ukrainian partners.

Kylie.

QUESTION: I’m just wondering if Russia has responded at all to Blinken’s letter yesterday and what diplomatic conversations between the U.S. and Russia have looked like in the last 24 hours.

MR PRICE: What I’ll say is we – the Secretary laid out for Foreign Minister Lavrov in a private communication the fact that, under the current circumstances and what we have seen from the Russian Federation so far, our conclusion that a meeting this week in Geneva would not serve the purpose that any such meeting would need to serve. And first and foremost, that is to avert a brutal, massive, costly conflict. The Russians, and all of you later, heard that publicly from Secretary Blinken. The Russians know precisely our position. They know through private communications and through our own public messaging that we stand ready to engage diplomatically if they are willing to do so in good faith, and if they are willing to change their posture we will be ready, willing, and able to engage them on this.

QUESTION: And did the Secretary detail what “in good faith” would look like in this letter, or was it broad descriptions like you just gave?

MR PRICE: We are not going to be prescriptive in terms of what de-escalation might look like, what good faith might look like. We have been very clear – because all of you know, presumably our counterparts in the Russian Federation know – what steps might look like if they were interested in signaling de-escalation. We have not seen any of those steps. And again, we have seen steps that actually move in the opposite direction.

QUESTION: And then just a last question. Can or will the U.S. keep open our embassy in Moscow if there is a full-scale invasion into Ukraine?

MR PRICE: We believe, in times of conflict, in times of crisis, that the ability to communicate is in some ways even more imperative. Now, long before the massive Russian military buildup started along Ukraine’s borders, in Belarus, of course, our team on the ground in Moscow and throughout Russia, they were in a very difficult operating environment – a very difficult operating environment because of the restrictions that the Russian Federation had imposed on them. It will be our goal to be in a position to maintain diplomatic communication, the ability to convey clearly any messages that we need to send to the Russian Federation. Embassies are an important tool in that, but we have also seen the Russian Federation even in recent days escalate on an unprovoked and needless basis the bilateral challenges in terms of our own diplomatic staffing in Moscow and our ability to operate an embassy on the ground. But again, we believe communication, we believe the ability to pass messages is even more important in times of great crisis.

QUESTION: Ned, on Nord Stream, are you working with the Germans to find alternative sources of energy for them? I mean, it seems like the pipeline is not going to go full – or going to go operational anytime soon, so are you working with them, with the Qataris or any other potential suppliers, perhaps in Algeria and so on, and about the means to get it there?

And I have a quick question on the diplomacy.

MR PRICE: Sure. Let me start with your question on the energy, and of course, this was something that President Biden discussed yesterday. We have been frank, we have been candid with the American people that our measures – the measures we have and are prepared to impose on the Russian Federation – certainly won’t be cost-free for the Russian Federation, but they won’t be entirely cost-free for the rest of the world as well. And so that is why we are working with countries around the world, executing a plan with major producing and consuming countries to secure the stability of global energy supplies, whether that’s oil, whether that’s LNG.

For energy consumers – and you heard this from Deputy National Security Advisor Daleep Singh yesterday – he made the point that we all have strategic reserves at our disposal, and those reserves we know could support the supply of global energy. The White House announced such a move late last year. There are other countries that have their own strategic supplies. For energy producers, we know that many of them have spare capacity to provide supply to global markets that could balance those markets in the event of any supply disruption.

More broadly, we’ve been very clear with the Russian Federation that any further attempt to weaponize energy, to constrict flows with malign geopolitical intent or purpose, would have massive consequences and, to your point, would only further the longstanding effort to diversify energy supplies for Europe and the rest of the world. We have heard from a number of countries, including Japan, including Australia, including Slovakia, that they are taking concrete steps in terms of global energy markets. We expect other countries will have announcements of their own. We also know that the International Energy Agency has announced that it’s monitoring and consulting with member states to ensure market stability going forward.

But to the question about diversification of supply, this has been a longstanding goal of ours. And to go back to the question of Nord Stream 2, there was the communiqué that together we drafted and finalized with the German Government over the summer, in the summer of July of 2021. It laid out a series of steps that Germany committed to taking with Ukraine to help Ukraine diversify its supply of energy, cognizant that Russia had weaponized energy flows in the past and Russia might have been looking to do so again in the future. If Russia were to take that step, we’ve been very clear about the massive consequences that would befall it.

QUESTION: Very quickly to follow up on Kylie’s and your response to her on diplomacy. So are you urging the Ukrainians not to cut off relations with Russia? Because there was talk that they might cut off all diplomatic relations with Russia.

MR PRICE: That’s a decision for the Ukrainian Government to make.

QUESTION: Of course, but are you bringing them – I mean, if they decided to cut off their relations with Russia, you wouldn’t say, “No, don’t do it now” or “Go ahead, do it”?

MR PRICE: That is a decision for the Ukrainian Government to make. Again, the Russian Federation has launched an assault on Ukraine’s sovereignty, on its territorial integrity, in many different ways and many different forms. But the decision as to whether to continue diplomatic relations between Kyiv and Moscow, that’s something that Kyiv will have to decide.

QUESTION: Ned, on the diplomacy, I’m curious about your reference publicly from the podium to what the Russians have been doing as kabuki theater. What specifically are you referring to? The meeting in Geneva between Secretary Blinken and Foreign Minister Lavrov? The UN Security Council meeting last week or even – whatever it was – a day or two ago? The Russian National Security – the —

MR PRICE: So I think you could point to any number of steps. The – what comes to my mind immediately was the dramatic, theatrical scene we saw – I guess it was last week now – between President Putin and his deputies, in which they had what was scripted, I assume, to be a pretty candid exchange indicating that the Russian Federation should pursue diplomacy, only as, at that very moment and in the days that followed, we saw additional Russian forces go to the border.

QUESTION: Right, but that —

MR PRICE: We saw additional Russian forces take up readiness. That is not consistent with a country that purports to be interested in diplomacy.

QUESTION: No, but that is not diplomacy per se. That was an internal government meeting. Whether they – it was staged or what —

MR PRICE: That was kabuki theater, I think we can agree.

QUESTION: Well, fine, yeah, but I want to know if you’re talking about the meeting in Geneva between the Secretary and Foreign Minister Lavrov.

MR PRICE: I was referring to the incident of kabuki theater that I just mentioned to you.

QUESTION: You’re referring specifically – okay, because I just want to make sure that you don’t think – you’re not now in a position where you think that the meeting in Geneva that did happen was a waste of time and simply an entertainment.

MR PRICE: Look, I wouldn’t want to characterize —

QUESTION: Or the Security Council meetings are a waste of time because – I just want to make sure that you’re not talking about those.

MR PRICE: Well, I – so the UN Security Council meeting most certainly was not a waste of time because the Russian Federation and the entire world heard from a number of countries the broad and strong consensus that this should be resolved diplomatically and that state sovereignty should be an inviolable principle. That certainly was not pointless.

Yes.

QUESTION: (Off-mike.)

MR PRICE: Sure.

QUESTION: Because before the Security Council meeting, U.S. officials said that they believed Russia could be using it as a pretext for this invasion. And you said earlier that this is and has been in some ways kabuki theater all along. So are you – to Matt’s point, are you making the assessment that the —

MR PRICE: The security – the Russian Security Council meeting you’re referring to?

QUESTION: No, sorry, the one last Thursday, before there was a briefing where U.S. officials said they believed given the document that the Russian mission circulated that they were going to use the meeting as a pretext. So do you assess now that all of these diplomatic engagements were part of a charade to give Russia cover, to show that they had been engaging in good faith diplomacy in their mind?

MR PRICE: I wouldn’t want to make a sweeping categorical judgment like that. What I will say is that, if you take a step back, we have not seen any indication that Russia’s stated commitment to the diplomatic path had – bore any resemblance to its actions or that its actions reflected any commitment to – stated commitment to the diplomatic path. That is not to say that there is not value in these sessions, and I think the UN Security Council session that you all saw last Thursday was extraordinarily valuable. It was valuable for – even for the Russian Federation, and if any of those messages got to the Russian people, they would have heard a strong message of resolve and consensus and unanimity from the rest of the world that the steps that Putin was taking, the plans that he may well still have in mind, that is not something that the rest of the world is prepared to countenance.

QUESTION: But the meetings in Geneva, the non-papers back and forth, that – you don’t think that that all was a charade by the Russian Government?

MR PRICE: I am not prepared to use such wholesale language. Now, have we been able to deter and to prevent the worst-case scenario? That’s still an unresolved question. What is not unresolved is that we have seen continued signs that the Russian Federation is moving forward with the plans that we have been warning about for weeks.

QUESTION: Can I have another follow-up?

QUESTION: Can I just point out that some people do find value in kabuki theater, especially the Japanese, who invented it?

MR PRICE: That’s – no —

QUESTION: They pay to go see it, so —

MR PRICE: No offense intended.

Yes.

QUESTION: Can I just – another follow-up?

MR PRICE: Yeah, yeah.

QUESTION: Yesterday Foreign Minister Kuleba said that their Plan A, obviously, is to use diplomacy to deter Russia. Plan B is to defend every inch of Ukrainian territory. You have previously praised their restraint. Do you agree with their Plan B? Do you think they have a right to self-defense? And if Russia moves past the current areas that the separatists control in the Donbas, do the Ukrainians have a right to respond?

MR PRICE: Of course, the Ukrainians have a right to self-defense.

Yes.

QUESTION: So I find there have been a lot of mixed signals coming from the PRC in terms of its stance on the Ukraine situation. At times they’ve talked about the importance of state sovereignty; other times they’ve railed against NATO expansion. Have you – has the State Department been in communication with PRC interlocutors seeking clarity on their position? And have you laid out any ways in which these ongoing signals might undercut U.S.-China ties?

And on a related note, you’ve kind of hinted before that if the PRC were to seek to undermine the impact of U.S. sanctions on Russia, then the U.S. would have countermeasures. Have those discussions continued with PRC interlocutors?

MR PRICE: Well, as you know, Secretary Blinken had an opportunity to speak to his counterpart, Foreign Minister Wang, just the other night. And one of the two primary topics they discussed was Russia’s – the crisis that Russia has needlessly precipitated with Ukraine and with the rest of the world. Secretary Blinken – and we issued a readout; the PRC also issued their own readout – but you saw in our readout that the Secretary made very clear where we stand in terms of our unwavering support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity and its sovereignty. And I think especially that last point, sovereignty, should be an element that the PRC understands quite well. We often in statecraft hear the PRC cite this principle of sovereignty, which in any number of instances they have claimed should be inviolable, should be sacrosanct, should be one of the foundational rules that countries abide by and respect.

So you’ll have to ask the PRC how they marry that longstanding position with anything less than an effort to use the considerable influence and sway they have with the Russian Federation to urge Vladimir Putin to back down, to de-escalate. Whether they are doing that, you’ll have to ask them. But we did see in the readout that our PRC counterparts are also calling for the situation to be resolved diplomatically and to be resolved peacefully. Now, whether Putin heeds that call, I think that is not something we yet know.

QUESTION: And what about relaying the potential impact on U.S.-China relations?

MR PRICE: Look, in terms of our bilateral relationship with —

QUESTION: In terms of China’s support for Russia in its railing against NATO expansion and the potential tacit endorsement that that provides – what’s the impact of that on U.S.-China relations?

MR PRICE: Well, we believe – and we’ve made this point not only about the PRC, but every responsible country in the world has, in our estimation, an obligation to use any influence it has with the Russian Federation to urge, to incentivize, to advocate for Vladimir Putin to back down, for the Russian Federation to de-escalate. Again, you will have to ask the PRC whether they have used their own considerable influence with the Russian Federation to that end. Of course, we’ve all read the 5,000-word joint communiqué, and we can glean our own conclusions from that.

I think what gives us concern is that – from that manifesto and from what we’ve seen not only in recent days, weeks, and months, but in recent years – is this growing partnership between Russia and the PRC. And I say it’s concerning because we talk about a rules-based international order, a rules-based international order that has been at the crux of seven-plus decades of unprecedented levels of stability, of security, of prosperity the world over, whether that’s in Europe or the Indo-Pacific and places in between.

It is true, I think, we think, that Russia and the PRC also want a world order. This is a vision that they appear to be developing together if you read that communiqué. But this is an order that is and would be profoundly illiberal, an order that stands in contrast to the system that countries around the world – including, by the way, Russia and in some ways the PRC – have built over the last seven decades. It is an order that is in many ways destructive rather than additive.

So that is as we see this relationship develop, and we’ve seen something that gives us great concern. And of course, in recent days we’ve seen Russia reach out to its autocratic counterparts in other corners of the globe. This gets back to one of the core points that the President has been making since before he assumed high office, and that is, increasingly, we are seeing the world divided between democracy and autocracy. It is and has been a charge of this President and this administration’s foreign policy to act to unite our democratic colleagues around the world, to act in unison, to galvanize collective action. And I think whether the challenge has been what Russia is doing, whether the challenge has been what the PRC is doing, what we are seeing from state and non-state actors around the world, you’ve seen us succeed in that.

But it will continue to be an animating principle as we continue to see the forces of autocracy, the forces of authoritarianism, the forces of illiberalism continue to work together and attempt to combine forces. But the other point, even as they try to do that, we are confident. We are confident in our own abilities. We are confident in our abilities as an international community, and whether that’s the West, whether that’s a community of democracies, whether it is our system of alliances and partnerships that span the globe.

And we’re confident for a number of reasons. If you look at it quantitatively, we have 50 percent-plus of global GDP. We have a large share of the world’s population. China and Russia, in terms of their GDP are, what, 20 percent of global GDP? We have innovation. We have entrepreneurship. We have a shared set of values that we really think are a core instrument of national power. And we know that when we put all of this together, especially when we act with our allies and our partners – as we’ve done in the face of the challenge that Russia has posed, in the face of the challenge to the rules-based international system that the PRC has posed – or even when you talk about the threats and challenges that we face that are not state actors – climate change, COVID, economic recovery – we know that acting together, we are situated to take on any threat, to seize any opportunity.

And that’s really been the driving force of our foreign policy. It’s why Secretary Blinken spent so much time of his first year in office repairing, revitalizing, in some ways reimagining the system of alliances and partnerships. And you’re seeing the dividends of that now play out, even in recent hours.

QUESTION: Well, first of all, can you guess how long that answer was, how many minutes that was?

MR PRICE: (Laughter.) I’m sure you will tell me.

QUESTION: I’ll pull it up – well, I can’t because my Otter seems to have, like, frozen here. But if —

MR PRICE: Yeah. I haven’t paid for the premium version.

QUESTION: But if you’re – yeah – but if you’re boasting about reinventing it and you’re seeing that – the fruits of all that labor now, you’re talking about the united reaction against —

MR PRICE: United – the united response of the international community.

QUESTION: To Russia?

MR PRICE: Yeah.

QUESTION: Okay. Can I – purely – it’s unrelated to Ukraine, but it is China. And that is something that I know Nike is interested in and has been asking about before. But there is barely an anniversary, a diplomatic – an anniversary in diplomatic history that goes by without the U.S. – the State Department at least, if not the White House – making some kind of comment about it. And in that light, regardless of how tense or strained relations are now with China, why is it that there hasn’t been any mention of Nixon’s – former President Nixon’s – the 50th anniversary of former President Nixon’s visit to China, which was a pretty groundbreaking event when it happened, paved the way for recognition or U.S. recognition of the PRC and opening of diplomatic relations.

And it seems to me that it would make sense for there to be some kind of mention of this, or are you just, like, embarrassed by it now and think that it should never have happened?

MR PRICE: I don’t think – certainly not the latter. I – Matt, there are some anniversaries that we commemorate there. There are other anniversaries that we don’t. I’m not aware of any plans at the moment for a statement, but —

QUESTION: Yeah, but (inaudible) statements about, like, the 17th anniversary of U.S.-Iceland relations or something – not to demean Iceland – but I mean, these kinds of things get attention. And this one, which was, a pretty big deal – a BFD, as the President might say – at the time and since, just seems to be being ignored.

MR PRICE: I don’t know that we’re ignoring it. I’m not sure that I would equate not putting out a formal statement with ignoring it.

Nike.

QUESTION: Thank you, Matt, for asking (inaudible). But my question is on Pakistan. Can I ask about Pakistan Prime Minister Khan’s visit to Russia? Does the State Department have a – an assessment of his visit at this timing?

MR PRICE: Well, we’re certainly aware of the trip, and the points I made earlier about the PRC in some ways apply here. We believe it’s the responsibility of every responsible country around the world to voice concern, to voice objection to what Putin appears to have in mind for Ukraine. We’ve communicated to Pakistan our position regarding Russia’s further renewed invasion of Ukraine, and we have briefed them on our efforts to pursue diplomacy over war. We have a longstanding partnership and cooperation with Pakistan. We view our partnership with a prosperous, with a democratic Pakistan as critical to U.S. interests. And we certainly hope, when it comes to those shared interests – the aversion of a costly conflict, the aversion of a destabilizing conflict, that every country around the world would make that point clearly in unambiguous language in their engagements with the Russian Federation.

Andrea.

QUESTION: On the —

QUESTION: Can I – sorry, can I just follow up on Khan’s visit? On the timing of his visit, is it the U.S. read that he’s indirectly endorsing Putin?

MR PRICE: You would have to ask the Pakistani Government what the intent is.

QUESTION: But I’m asking your read.

MR PRICE: You would have to ask the Pakistani Government. I’m just not in a position to offer an assessment on the timing of foreign counterparts’ travel to another country.

Yes, Andrea.

QUESTION: Do you have a different assessment of Vladimir Putin than the one that this government had – that this President had – after Geneva, or was the previous assessment wrong?

MR PRICE: The previous assessment and the assessment now is that we would prefer a relationship with Russia that is stable and predictable. But at every turn before Geneva or just about every turn before Geneva and at turns since Geneva, the Russian Federation has indicated that they have apparently little interest in that type of relationship. So we’ve always said that – and we said this before Geneva when we responded decisively in response to interference in our elections, in response to the Russian Federation’s use of weapons of mass destruction against dissidents on foreign soil, for SolarWinds – that we would respond decisively, strongly in response to these types of activities. We have. The same is true if Russia continues its invasion of Ukraine. Same principle applies.

QUESTION: A separate question on a different subject, if I could ask a quick question about Iran?

MR PRICE: Okay. Any final questions on Russia/Ukraine before we move on?

QUESTION: Yes. Yes.

MR PRICE: Okay, please. Please.

QUESTION: On sanctions.

MR PRICE: Yes.

QUESTION: Today the Russian ambassador to Washington said that he doesn’t remember a single day that – when Russia lived without restrictions from the Western world. Putin proved he’s immune to sanctions. He has $600 billion in federal reserves. He has been in the driving seat making decisions to which the West is responding now and was responding since 2008. Are you thinking of a strategical approach to deal with this? You just said that they are trying to change the world order.

MR PRICE: So to the statement from the Russian Federation that they have been under sanctions since 2014, that is of course accurate. The sanctions that we have put in place and that we will continue to put in place are qualitatively different from any measures that the United States or any other country has imposed on the Russian Federation, including in 2014. So if they are comparing what they’ve been under now to what they will be under in – going forward if this invasion moves forward, that would be a profound miscalculation on their part.

When you talk about and think about the sanctions that we’ve already put in place, Nord Stream 2 is off the table. The Germans have taken decisive action. We have taken decisive action. That’s an $11 billion project that is now a piece of steel at the bottom of the ocean. We have, in lockstep with our allies, put in place blocking sanctions against the fifth-largest Russian financial institution. That’s $50 billion in assets. We’ve put in place blocking sanctions against another bank that funds the Ministry of Defense with some $35 billion in assets. In other words, these institutions can no longer make any transactions with the United States or with Europe, given Europe’s – the EU’s own corresponding actions in this regard.

Here’s the other point: With the authorities we have, with the intent we have, no Russian financial institution is safe if the invasion proceeds. As you heard from Daleep Singh yesterday, we are ready at the press of a button to take action against the two largest financial institutions in Russia. Together, these are institutions that hold three-quarters of a trillion dollars in assets, $750 billion in assets, half of the total Russian banking system. There are other measures and moves we have in store and that are ready if Russia continues with this invasion, including export controls, targeted sanctions against oligarchs and elites, and other measures.

So the Russians can depict these moves however they would like. I think it is noteworthy what we heard from our Ukrainian partners yesterday. You heard from Foreign Minister Kuleba as he was standing right next to Secretary Blinken here at the department. He said that, quote, “[W]e do appreciate…the sanctions which were announced today. They target Russia. They’re very specific. They are painful.”

QUESTION: (Off-mike.)

MR PRICE: Please. Please, go ahead. Yeah, Joel.

QUESTION: Thanks, Ned. I arrived with a couple questions of my own and have a couple follow-ups for this interesting conversation, from what you told my colleagues. First, do you think that China, given their desire for the world order that you just described, regards Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a step towards bringing that about?

MR PRICE: It is certainly not a step in the direction of the principle that the PRC claims to prize, and that is state sovereignty. You – I think everyone in this room is familiar with the position the PRC has taken in response to Russia’s aggression in Ukraine since 2014. I wouldn’t want to characterize that, but it suggests a level of deep unease.

So again, I would refer you to the PRC for any comment they might have on what Putin has in store, but if we are to judge the PRC based on what they have said consistently on the world stage in any number of fora, a direct assault on the sovereignty, on the territorial integrity of another state, that would not be consistent with what we’ve heard.

QUESTION: Yeah, I was just trying to clarify, because I thought I heard you say they’re – they’ve combined forces somehow.

MR PRICE: It was a reference to the burgeoning partnership that we’ve seen between these two countries over the course of many years now.

QUESTION: Okay. On Ukraine’s Plan B, fighting for every inch, Senator Risch, who is of course ranking on Foreign Relations and on Intelligence, or a senior member of the Intelligence Committee, has said that Russia could sweep across Ukraine pretty quickly, their first day would be their best day, they’d immediately face resistance movements. So I wonder, would the United States as a member of NATO either encourage or object to other NATO members offering this Ukrainian resistance cross-border safe haven?

MR PRICE: Countries are going to make their own sovereign decisions. We have in recent weeks, as you know, worked with a number of our NATO Allies to authorize them to provide U.S.-origin equipment to our Ukrainian partners – this is defensive security equipment – with an understanding that our Ukrainian partners need supplies, need materiel to defend themselves. The United States has provided them with this. We have – a number of our NATO Allies have done the same.

But when it comes to the decision that NATO Allies or other countries in Europe might make along those lines, I’d need to refer you there.

QUESTION: And I guess I wonder, do you see any lessons from Afghanistan for the kind of risk that we’re of course – when the Taliban could retire across the border to a place where they couldn’t be attacked, then that was difficult for a modern military to defeat.

MR PRICE: I – look, I would hesitate to make battlefield comparisons between two very different countries.

QUESTION: Finally, what I hope are truly a couple of quick ones. Those Nord Stream 2 sanctions, are those permanent or do you think that, like, the permanent punishment for this, that that’s gone, or do you regard that as something that could be lifted again later in exchange for de-escalation? And can we also get an answer to Foreign Minister Kuleba’s request for a Lend-Lease program? Do you expect that to proceed?

MR PRICE: Look, the fact is that sanctions are a means to an end. There is no sanction in any responsible sanctions program around the world that is permanent, and that is precisely because we don’t sanction countries just with the goal of enacting sanctions. This is not a policy to be purely punitive; this is a policy to change behavior. In this case, this is a policy to deter a further Russian invasion of Ukraine, to deter a war – a bloody, costly, devastating war that would take place on European soil and that would constitute the greatest threat to peace and security since the conclusion of World War II, certainly since the end of the Cold War.

QUESTION: Wait, so now the imposition of sanctions is a deterrent? I thought we just spent the last, like, couple months – you and the administration spent, like, the last couple months arguing that the threat of sanctions was the deterrent, and that if you imposed – that if you actually imposed them, then you would lose that deterrent.

MR PRICE: Matt, you’ve heard us say —

QUESTION: But you can’t have it both ways.

MR PRICE: We’re not having it both ways, Matt. You have heard us say very clearly, if Russia’s invasion escalates, if Russia’s actions escalate, so too will our response. We are prepared to enact an escalating series of measures against the Russian Federation if – unless – until and unless the Russian Federation changes course.

Said.

QUESTION: No Lend-Lease program?

QUESTION: Can I —

MR PRICE: So look, I don’t have any response to that, but – specific response to that, but I will make the point that this has not been Lend-Lease; this has a been a program of provision. We have provided our Ukrainian partners with, over the course of the last year, $650 million worth of defensive security assistance. We’re in a constant conversation and dialogue with our Ukrainian partners about their defensive security needs, and that will continue. As I mentioned before, if the Russian invasion continues, we will not only continue with that provision of security assistance, but we’ll double down on it.

Said.

QUESTION: Could I change topics? Just a very quick one on the Palestinian —

MR PRICE: Anything left on Russia-Ukraine?

QUESTION: I have on Ukraine.

QUESTION: Ukraine, Ukraine.

MR PRICE: In the very back, please.

QUESTION: Yes, sir. So – but you – we listened to the Russians also, and they present also, as they say, their legit security grievances. And it seems the West in a way or another did not reach any common – to which extent the U.S. and NATO now is really going into this offer of diplomacy? Where is the West going to give an in into the security demands from Putin?

MR PRICE: So this is something we’ve spoken to at great length. It’s actually something that we put in writing at some length. Subscribers of El País can see it with their own eyes. But we’ve been quite clear that there are some, quote/unquote, “demands” that the Russian Federation has put forward that are non-starters for us. The very principles that are at stake in terms of the rules-based international order, those are not negotiable. The idea that any other country can dictate the policy choices, whether foreign policy or domestic policy, of any other country – that is not something we’re going to negotiate. International borders, internationally recognized borders, sovereignty, the inviolability of borders – that is not something that is up for negotiation.

But what we – there are some areas that would improve our security, our own security environment, the security environment of the transatlantic community, and could address some of the stated security concerns of the Russian Federation. And we’ve delineated a series of those: discussions regarding the placement of offensive missiles in Europe; broader arms control protocols; protocols regarding stability and transparency; confidence-building measures. There are a number of areas that we think have the potential to be fruitful if we find a negotiating counterpart in the Russian Federation that operates in good faith. We have not found that yet, and I think at this stage those sort of broader areas may not take precedence to the first priority that we have, and that’s averting a bloody, costly, devastating war in Ukraine.

So I think our diplomacy going forward, at least for the foreseeable future, if, again, we find a counterpart in Moscow that is willing to sit down in good faith to discuss these issues in good faith, we are going to be very focused on saving lives, on preventing a war, on seeing to it that the plans Putin has set in motion over the course of many months now do not go forward.

Conor.

QUESTION: Two very quick ones on Trevor Reed and Paul Whelan. Do you have any indication that their cases are being treated separately from all this? Any concerns that the crisis would affect their detentions?

MR PRICE: We always treat the cases of U.S. hostages separate and apart from geopolitical issues and geopolitical dynamics. It remains an absolute priority for us to see the release of Paul Whelan and Trevor Reed, both of whom have been held unjustly, traveled to Russia as tourists, have been imprisoned on false charges that entire time. So it’s a priority of ours.

QUESTION: You do, but do you have any concern that the Russian Government would not?

MR PRICE: Again, human beings should not be held as pawns in terms of state-to-state relations. It is our priority to see them released, to do everything we can to achieve their release as quickly as we can.

QUESTION: And then secondly, do you have any new estimate of the number of Americans that would be in Ukraine at this moment in time?

MR PRICE: So as we’ve told you, late last year, October of last year, it was our assessment at the time that there were some 6,600 Americans who were resident in Ukraine. Now, that timeframe is important because the very month – October 2021 – that this assessment was last updated was the very month that we started urging Americans not to travel to Ukraine. In more recent weeks, as you know, we have been recommending and, even more recently, urging Americans to leave Ukraine.

So I think there is every expectation that the number of Americans who are resident in Ukraine late last year, October of last year, is far lower now than it was then. I can tell you procedurally we have been in repeated contact with Americans who remain in Ukraine. We have asked them to provide us with their contact information so that we can continue to be in communication with them to urge them to leave the country, to avail themselves of commercial and private options that continue to be available, and to provide any form of support that they may need in doing so, and that includes a repatriation loan if they’re not able to afford the return travel on their own.

When – in addition, we have provided specific guidance on overland crossings that Americans can take, providing specific recommendations about border crossings. We have been engaged in diplomacy with our Polish allies to see to it that Americans need not have any sort of advanced authorization to travel across the border. We’ve even established a welcome center across the Polish border to assist Americans should they need any assistance, whether it’s a passport application, whether it’s any form – other form of consular assistance.

Yes.

QUESTION: You just used the word “hostage” to describe Trevor Reed and Paul Whelan.

MR PRICE: They’re Americans who are unjustly detained.

QUESTION: So do you regard them as hostages? I haven’t heard that formulation before, but maybe I missed it.

MR PRICE: They are – they are Americans who are held unjustly against their will.

QUESTION: I know, but do you regard them as hostages?

MR PRICE: I – we’ll get back to you if there’s a – if – on that. i

Yes.

QUESTION: (Inaudible) about Latin America, the fact that Putin is looking for new partners in Latin America – for example, Argentina, Brazil. What’s the position of the State Department? And do you think this is a way to increase the pressure on the United States, talking about the close relationship of United States with Latin America?

MR PRICE: Well, it goes back to what we were discussing before, and this is the fact that what we are seeing is autocracies around the world band together, and we’ve seen in some ways Russia at the vanguard of this activity. When it comes to their motives or intentions, that’s not something I would want to speak to from here. I would refer you to the – to Moscow to speak to their own foreign policy decisions. But we have certainly seen Moscow reach out to some of the most repressive, autocratic, undemocratic governments in this hemisphere. That includes Nicaragua. That includes Cuba. That includes Venezuela.

Yes, Said.

QUESTION: Thank you. I want to move to the Palestinian issue and I have a quick one on Iran. On the Palestinian issue —

QUESTION: (Off-mike.)

QUESTION: Yeah, okay. Yeah. On the Palestinian issue, I know I have asked in this room many times before on your position regarding the practice of administrative detentions by Israel, to which all Palestinians at one time or another probably experience. There is one particular case, a 14-year-old boy who has been falsely accused. One Israeli judge after Israeli judge threw it out of court, but the authorities keep him in prison. They keep renewing this. He has a neuromuscular disease. He might die in prison. Will the United States call on Israel to quit this practice, especially against children who have not – who have been found innocent by their own judicial system?

MR PRICE: Said, you’ve heard this from us before, but we urge —

QUESTION: And the boy’s name, by the way, is just, for the record, Amal Nakhleh.

MR PRICE: We urge the full respect for human rights in Israel and the West Bank and Gaza. As we’ve said many times, Palestinians and Israelis alike equally deserve to live safely and securely, to enjoy equal measures of freedom, of security, of prosperity.

QUESTION: With all due respect, the Palestinians do not arrest Israelis and put them under administrative detention.

MR PRICE: Said, we – and again, you have heard this from us before, but we continue to elevate the role of human rights in our foreign relations and to encourage, to your question, legal reforms that advance respect for human rights of all individuals.

QUESTION: My second question also pertains to the holding of dead Palestinians, killed Palestinians, those who have been killed by the Israeli soldiers for years on end. Is that the – is that a form of collective punishment? Does the – does this administration view this as a collective punishment?

MR PRICE: We have stressed to Israel both publicly as well as privately our strong hope that any measures that Israel takes would be designed to avoid further escalating tensions and to take into consideration the impact of any such measures on the Palestinian people.

QUESTION: And lastly, on Iran, should we expect some sort of a deal or returning to a deal over the next few days, as was suggested?

MR PRICE: Well, you’ve heard this from my colleagues, but there has been significant progress, and we are close to a possible deal, but at the same time, a number of very difficult issues remain unresolved. What we know is that there is very little time remaining to reach a deal, to resolve these remaining issues given the pace of Iran’s nuclear advances. You’ve heard us say this before, but it remains true that even as we are narrowing the set of issues we’re discussing, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.

If Iran shows seriousness, if it demonstrates serious of purpose in Vienna, we believe that we can and should reach an understanding on a potential mutual return to compliance in short order, potentially within days. But anything much beyond that, if this were to drag on any longer than that, would put the possibility of return to the deal at grave and profound risk.

Andrea.

QUESTION: (Inaudible) issues, whether they involve equipment, centrifuges, compliance, verification? Broad categories, Ned.

MR PRICE: I really can’t, and that is primarily because we are at this decisive stage where it is incumbent on the Iranians and all parties to do everything we can to narrow those differences. We’re going to be a little bit more circumspect at this especially sensitive period, but again, if the Iranians demonstrate seriousness of purpose, we believe that we can achieve an understanding in relatively short order.

QUESTION: (Inaudible) anything more on travel?

MR PRICE: On travel?

QUESTION: By the Secretary.

MR PRICE: Oh, by the Secretary. We – look, we do not have any travel to announce or to preview at this time. The Secretary has been working the phones. He has been on with Josep Borrell of the EU today. He spoke to his British counterpart, Elizabeth Truss, earlier today as well. And I expect you will see him continue to engage with his counterparts around the world.

Yes.

QUESTION: On Yemen, we saw the designations today, and in the statement you said they are intensifying the humanitarian crisis. When you removed them last year from the terrorist organization list, you said you did that for humanitarian purposes. Is the State Department – my first question: Is the State Department objecting designating them as a terrorist organization?

MR PRICE: So as you know, there’s a review underway regarding that very question, so I’m not in a position to speak to it in any great detail. What I can say is that we have a number of tools at our disposal, including the tools we use today in mounting sanctions and designations against these Houthi-affiliated individuals and entities, that can hold the Houthis accountable for their reprehensible behavior. We are committed to doing so; we will continue to do so. We will use every appropriate tool to hold accountable those Houthi leaders who are responsible for the terrorist attacks for – against our partners in the region, for the violence in Yemen itself, for the humanitarian emergency, which by many estimations is now the world’s worst humanitarian catastrophe with some 16 million people who are suffering from food insecurity and malnutrition.

So we are committed to doing everything we can to bring this conflict to an end, knowing that only through a diplomatic resolution will we be able to, on a sustainable basis, calm the violence, ease the humanitarian suffering of the Yemeni people, and mitigate the threat that the United States and our partners face from the Houthis, including in the context of these attacks.

QUESTION: On Iran, do we expect anything regarding the detainees ahead of the deal?

MR PRICE: Again, this is an issue that is of the utmost importance to the United States. At every single opportunity, we make the release of Americans, of other third-country nationals, a priority of ours. We have been clear that the nuclear negotiations in Vienna and our efforts to see our unjustly detained citizens released, these operate on separate tracks precisely because a potential return to the JCPOA has always, at best, been an uncertain proposition, and we want the release of our citizens to be a certain proposition.

So we have not explicitly tied our Americans – tied these individuals, these detainees to progress in the nuclear talks. But as Rob Malley has made clear, it is – certainly it colors our engagement in Vienna and elsewhere knowing that this is a government that is unjustly detaining Americans and other third-country nationals.

So in every other context we’re doing this, but certainly in the case of Iran we’re making every effort to see our Americans, to see other third-country nationals released just as quickly as possible.

QUESTION: Back on Yemen and the Houthis.

MR PRICE: Mm-hmm.

QUESTION: And I realize that a lot of people probably think this is just a semantic thing, so I’ll keep it short, but the – these designations were made under an executive order that is a counterterrorism executive order. And you – in the Secretary’s statement and in the Treasury’s statement, it refers to the Houthis committing terrorist acts, but it doesn’t identify them as terrorists. And the EO – they’re being used – they’re being designated under a counterterrorism EO simply because of their affiliation with the IRGC Qods Force, which is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization.

So my question is: Do you believe that the Houthis as a group are terrorists? You say that – you’ve designated them under a counterterrorism executive order. You accused them of staging, launching terrorist attacks. But you won’t call them terrorists. Why not?

MR PRICE: Matt, so this is a question that’s based on semantics, but we’ve been very clear that —

QUESTION: Well, and —

MR PRICE: — that the Houthis have launched reprehensible terrorist attacks —

QUESTION: Yes.

MR PRICE: — against our partners in the region. These may be attacks that are targeting our partners, but these types of operations have the potential not only to harm citizens of Saudi Arabia, citizens of the United Arab Emirates, but Americans —

QUESTION: Yes. Yes.

MR PRICE: — who may be in the region as well. So we have been very clear that these are terrorist attacks.

QUESTION: Yeah, but you’re not saying that the Houthis themselves are terrorists, and I’m just wondering why. And yes, it’s a semantic argument, but I’m just looking at a statement that came out from Senator Murphy and a bunch of his colleagues urging you not to reinstate the Foreign Terrorist Organization designation against the Houthis. So – because it would cause grave damage and economic – humanitarian – even worse humanitarian disaster. But yet, today you have designated these individuals and entities under a counterterrorism executive order and accused them of committing terrorist attacks. So what’s the problem? Why can’t you identify the Houthis as terrorists?

MR PRICE: It is completely consistent that a certain label and a certain authority – in this case, the FTO – not be applied to a group that can commit terrorist attacks. There are any number of examples of groups that aren’t FTOs that you know well that have committed, over the course of years, consistent terrorist attacks. This is a question of semantics. This is a question of legal authorities.

QUESTION: So what – well, it’s a question of political will, right? Or —

MR PRICE: It is a question of us demonstrating that we have a number of tools and a number of authorities to hold Houthi leaders and others affiliated with this movement accountable for their reprehensible actions —

QUESTION: Okay.

MR PRICE: — including the terrorist attacks that they’ve undertaken in recent days against our partners in the region.

QUESTION: Okay. Can you give me an example of a group that has been committing terrorist attacks for decades that has not been labeled an FTO?

MR PRICE: Matt, I think there are a number of examples. You could look at the Taliban as a group that is not an FTO that I think you would probably agree has committed terrorist attacks.

Thank you all very much.

4,a3a8e7f1-d482-401b-93fc-43ed7bebb465,[],,"As Vladimir Putin moved Russian troops into parts of eastern Ukraine where Russia-friendly populations are considerable, Congressman Stephen Lynch has been warning of the start of a new Cold War as the dictator presses for a return to what he regards as the glory days of the Soviet Union.

In reacting to Putin’s aggression, US officials have turned to sanctions after diplomatic efforts appear to have fallen short.

Lynch, a South Boston Democrat who also represents half of Dorchester and parts of the South Shore and is chair of the House Subcommittee on National Security, held a hearing as the Ukrainian drama unfolded last week. He also appeared on WCVB and CNN, where he issued warnings about what Putin was up to.

“If you look at what happened in Crimea, you know, they denied what they were doing right till it happened,” Lynch said on CNN, referring to Russia’s invasion and annexation of that peninsula seven years ago. “So, there’s very little trust there. That seems to be the way Putin operates.”

Asked if there is still a diplomatic path forward, Lynch laid it on Putin. The European Union and NATO are “willing partners” in dialogue, he said, though there is a danger of “negotiating ourselves into an invasion here.”

The US and its European allies should keep a united front, he said, and not let Putin slowly subdivide Ukraine.

There are 44 million people in Ukraine, Lynch noted. “This is about their sovereignty,” he said. “And this is about Putin’s ideology of wanting to recreate some iteration of the former Soviet Union.”

Among the elected leaders who represent Boston on Capitol Hill, Lynch has been the one most out front in recent weeks when it comes to reacting to Putin’s moves.

Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley shares representation of Boston with Lynch. On Tuesday, her spokesman pointed to comments she had made earlier in February. She said then that harsh sanctions and increases in military aid to Ukraine will “only raise tensions and hurt” diplomatic efforts. “We can and must prioritize diplomacy and de-escalation,” she said.

US Sen. Elizabeth Warren has voiced support for President Biden’s approach on sanctions. US Sen. Ed Markey has sounded a similar note and said US officials should focus on finding an “off-ramp” as tensions escalate.

“If Russia invades, it would be the first major war in Europe since 1945. We cannot allow that to happen,” Markey told WCVB on Monday.

But in a separate interview at the station, Lynch said that economic sanctions might not be a threat to Putin. “Inadvertently, I think, that Putin is attracted by that offer, and that he would gladly trade some economic pain for acquiring the 44 million people in Ukraine as his subjects.”

On Wednesday, Markey called the Russian invasion of Ukraine a ""savage and illegal violation of Ukraine's sovereignty.""

Markey voiced support for Biden's move to sanction Putin, calling them ""our best non-military option – to impose consequences on the Kremlin, Russia’s defense sector, and Putin’s petro-oligarch cronies for this blatant violation of international law.""",https://www.dotnews.com/2022/who-putin-says-lynch-crisis-ukraine

3:33 P.M. EST

MS. PSAKI: Hi, everyone. Happy Wednesday. Are we Wednesday? Yes. Okay. We have a graphic here today because it’s been awhile since we’ve had a graphic, so I wanted to deliver on that.

So, as you all know, we announced our first tranche of sanctions in less — less than a day after the beginning of the invasion, with Allies and partners from the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, and Australia.

And what I — we wanted to provide to all of you today is an overview of what we’re seeing as an impact on the Russian economy. Obviously, the bite of these sanctions has not taken place yet, so this is largely in anticipation.

So, let me just go through a couple of these points:

Borrowing costs for the Russian government has spiked to almost 11 percent — highest since 2015.

Foreign investors are fleeing Russia.

The Ruble is trading at its weakest level since November 2020 — one of the weakest currencies in the world.

In response to inflation risk, the Russian Central Bank has hiked rates eight times in the past year to 9.5 percent.

And Bloomberg reported — just going to cite Bloomberg there — that “The fortunes of Russia’s super-rich have tumbled $32 billion this year, with the escalating conflict in Ukraine poised to make that wealth destruction much larger.”

So, as I started off saying, this is before the bite even takes place. And this is just after the beginning. I mean, we’ve only had, obviously, a first tranche here. But it’s — this is a vicious feedback loop that will get more severe if Putin doesn’t escalate [deescalate].

So, as he’s looking at the impact on his own economy, on his rich and wealthy oligarch friends, and on the people of Russia, these are the facts, regardless of what you’re hearing from the Kremlin, about the impact.

Also, I just wanted to note, because I know that we put out these sanctions when a lot was happening yesterday — just wanted to give you a little bit more detail of them. Obviously, you, hopefully, have seen the announcement and the statement from the President about Nord Stream 2. We can come back to that, but that is an additional step today.

And also, on banks and the announcement we made yesterday, what we did was we used our most powerful sanctions tool to target two major state-owned Russian banks for the first time; that is the significance. These banks can no longer — what it means is they can no longer make any transactions with the United States or Europe, and their assets in the financial system will be frozen.

They are the glorified piggybanks — some of the glorified piggybanks for the Kremlin, including one of them which is a key financial institution where — where support — military finances has been held. And this will have a significant impact on Russian leadership and the inner circle because they’re state-owned control — banks controlled by them.

We also were clear yesterday — but again, there was a lot going on, so I just wanted to touch on this — on this lightly — that no financial institution is safe. And the authority that was announced yesterday means that we can expand this to other financial institutions in Russia. And we have every capability and capacity to do that.

Second, we made an announcement about sovereign debt. And essentially, this means — I know there’s been a lot of — some commentary out there — some from Russia, of course — that they have a rainy-day fund. A rainy-day fund is limited. A rainy-day funds mean you can only tap into it until the rainy-day fund is done.

The ability to purchase sovereign debt means that you can gain access to additional funding. And what we are essentially doing is cutting off their ability to — to tap into that from the United States and Europe.

Finally, on elites, what is significant about this — and somebody asked me this question about what’s different. So, some of the people who were sanctioned yesterday are repeat people that we have sanctioned in the past. But the additional step we took was that we sanctioned family members, because what we’ve seen in terms of tactics that they’ve used in the past, is they have moved — they’re very sophisticated, some of these oligarchs; no surprise — they’ve moved money around to children, to family members so they could still have access to it. And we wanted to reduce the likelihood of that. So that is an additional step we took. So I just wanted to cover that.

One other note: Today also marks 100 days since the President signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Time flies. It’s also day 400 of the administration. In the past 100 days, we’ve hit the ground running, rolling out nearly $100 billion worth of programs and funding to state and local governments.

This funding will help rebuild crumbling road and bridges, replace lead pipes, help provide high-speed Internet to every family in America, and produce concrete results that change people’s lives for the better.

To continue this momentum, today, the Department of Transportation announced nearly $450 million available to strengthen port infrastructure and supply chain resiliency. And, obviously, there is more to come.

Chris, your first day in the AP seat.

Q Yes.

MS. PSAKI: Welcome to the front of the room. No pressure.

Q Thank you very much. So a few questions about Ukraine. First, you talked about the impact of the economy on Russia. Ukraine is also feeling a lot of economic pain right now. What more is the White House prepared to do to shore up their economy, provide them with financial assistance?

MS. PSAKI: Well, we have provided them an extensive amount of financial assistance, including recently announcing $1 billion in sovereign — I mean in loan guarantees. And that is something we are open to building upon.

And we are going to continue to assess what the impact is on the Ukrainian economy, what is needed on the ground. That applies to both access to — to, you know, economic assistance, as well as humanitarian assistance.

So, I don’t have anything to announce today, but we will continue to be a large provider and supporter of financial and economic assistance to Ukraine.

Q A new AP poll found that only 26 percent of Americans want the U.S. to play a major role in this — in this crisis. Given that this could increase costs on Americans — gas prices, other economic ripples — has the White House done enough to prepare Americans for what the U.S. role could be and what impact it could be on their lives?

MS. PSAKI: Well, this is very important to the President personally. It’s why he gave remarks — delivered the remarks he did last week and why he has spoken several times to provide updates to the American people over the last couple of days.

Two pieces I would note that I think are very important as Americans are tuning in and learning more about this conf- — this potential conflict — this conflict that’s underway, I guess I should say, between Russia and Ukraine:

One, the President has no intention of sending U.S. military or U.S. troops to fight in Ukraine. It is hard to know — because I don’t think it was in your poll — how people assess what “major involvement” means. But that has not changed in terms of the President’s view and his approach.

Second is he is going to do everything he can to reduce the impact on energy costs for the American people. And that means engaging closely with partners around the world. It means considering a range of options that are all on the table to reduce the market — the impact on the oil markets, and that is what would impact energy costs.

But the last thing I would say is that the President and the White House — you know, we make national security decisions based on what’s best for our country’s national security, not on the latest polling. And if you step back, what, hopefully, the American people will see and have seen is that while Russia has sought to divide our allies and the American people, the President has sought to revitalize our partnerships and alliances and unite our country. He’s standing up for our national security interests and bedrock democratic values against the aggression of a dictator threatening to further invade a sovereign country.

That’s why he’s doing what he’s doing. So, we’re less focused on the politics of Ukraine and more focused on preventing a war.

Q The other question —

MS. PSAKI: Oh, go ahead.

Q — I have was: Yesterday, the administration said the goal of the sanctions is to “prevent and deter” a wider invasion of Ukraine. If Russia does attack, as U.S. officials are warning that they’re imminently prepared to do, does that mean that strategy has failed?

MS. PSAKI: Well, I would say as we look at it, we’re focused on accomplishing two things. One is implementing serious costs for the actions that have already been taken — so, the actions in the Donbas. And we’ve taken steps beyond what we did in 2014, which, obviously, I just outlined at the beginning of the briefing.

Second, yes, deterrence is part of our objective. If he goes further, we will go further. We have a range of tools at our disposal. I mentioned some of the potential financial step — or steps we could take that could impact financial institutions. That is — is very significant and could have a very significant impact, but we have far more options beyond that, including export controls.

And what export control steps would mean — you know, Russia — as President Putin looks to the future of Russia, there is a lot of access to different industries, technologies that he needs and would rely on in order for the economy to grow and flourish in the future, whether it’s AI, whether it’s other technological sectors, biotech, semiconductors — a term we’ve used a lot in here. And what this would do, would essentially cut off access to that; that would also be a significant step.

So, point is: We have more steps we can take, and we’re going to continue to apply those if he escalates.

Go ahead.

Q Thanks, Jen. Given the possibility of an attack seems particularly high today, can you walk us through how the President is spending his day, how his security team is spending the day, if they’re doing anything in these — what could be these final hours before an attack, if that’s the case?

MS. PSAKI: Well, I — I’ve seen the reporting on this. But let me — let me be very clear: We have been saying for days that Russian military forces are in an attack position; that has not changed. They are capable of operationalizing at any point in time. We are in constant contact with the Ukrainians about their positioning, about their capacity and capabilities. We’re not predicting a day, a moment, or an hour. That has been our assessment and the — what we’ve been communicating with the Ukrainians for some time now.

Let me tell you, though, something else that we’re also seeing or assessing right now: We believe — obviously, we’ve laid out a game plan that we believe that President Putin has been implementing over the course of the last several weeks, if not longer.

It’s clear — and what our assessment is, is that President Putin did not expect the United States to have the level of information that we have, did not expect us to put out this amount of information that we have put out, did not expect the global community to be as unified, including in the — how unified the global community was in putting out the sanctions yesterday. And what we’re seeing now — our assessment is that he is improvising, adapting, and we’re having to respond and adapt his own actions to — as we are even — as we are responding to him.

So, we don’t have a new assessment. I will tell you that what the President is doing is what he has been doing for several days now, which is continuing to meet and engage with his national security team.

Obviously, he had a PDB this morning, and he will receive regular updates from his team. He will continue to engaze [sic] clo- — engage closely with partners and Allies, some things that he — something that he has been doing for several days now. But that is cont- — the continuation of what our engagement has been.

Q So, given that we could be looking at an imminent attack, is there anything this White House, this President believes he can do to stop it?

MS. PSAKI: Well, I think — what I — I think what’s important to note here is we have been saying “imminent” for days now. And what I’m conveying to you is that we’re also seeing adjustments by President Putin or the need to adapt in response to what our actions and what our response has been.

So, what the President has been doing has cont- — has been continuing to work with partners and Allies to ensure we remain united, to leave the door open to diplomacy, but to make very clear to President Putin and to our partners around the world that there will be significant consequences beyond what we have done already should he invade further.

Go ahead, Jeff.

Q Jen, what’s the next trigger point for new sanctions? Obviously, yesterday’s was the start of the invasion.

MS. PSAKI: Mm-hmm.

Q What does Putin have to do next to see another wave?

MS. PSAKI: I’m not — I’m not going to give you a detailed, “If he does this, we will do that.” I would only just reiterate what I said a little bit earlier, which is that we have the specific authority, based on the announcement made yesterday, to take additional steps as it relates to financial institutions in Russia. There’s additional enormous financial institutions — the two largest banks, for example — which were not a part of the announcement made — we made yesterday. There’s additional steps we’ve expressed an openness to, including taking steps as it relates to export controls.

So, this — these are assessments we will continue to make internally. And we have a range of tools that we are prepared to — steps we are prepared to take should he further escalate.

Q On Monday, when President Putin made clear that he was sending troops into those two breakaway regions, the White House initially said that does not constitute an invasion because Russia already has troops there; this is just “more overt.” The next day, President Biden came out and said, “This is the start of invasion.” What happened overnight? What changed to lead to that change in rhetoric?

MS. PSAKI: Well, I talked about this a little bit yesterday, but what we looked at and what we assessed were a range of steps. I’m not, obviously, going to get into military assessments or movements today, just like I didn’t yesterday. But we looked at a couple of steps, including President Putin taking steps, as it relates to the Duma, to ask for authority to take additional military action beyond that region. We looked at his recognition. We looked at the position — positioning of troops and military. And we looked at the range of steps over that period of time to assess and make that decision.

I would also note that our Deputy National Security Advisor was on TV conveying that that morning as well.

Q All right. And just lastly on this: The President of Russia, President Putin, said on Monday that he felt the West was going to impose sanctions basically regardless of what they did. Given that, you’re obviously trying and effectively putting a lot of pain on the Russian economy. Do you think these sanctions will actually be a deterrent?

MS. PSAKI: Well, I think that is a decision for President Putin to make. I mean, there are statements he has conveyed, in terms of what he wants to achieve here, right? The division of NATO; the opposite is happening. Right? He wanted to see Nord Stream 2 move forward — a key prize for him; that is obviously not happening. He wants to have a flourishing economy for the Russian people; just even without the bite of our sanctions, that is clearly not happening.

So, this is an assessment he’s going to have to make, and we expect he’ll hear from people around him who are being impacted and other people in Russia about the impact of these sanctions.

Go ahead.

Q Does the White House share the assessment of the Australian Prime Minister today that an attack is likely within 24 hours?

MS. PSAKI: I’m not going to give an additional timeline to it. We’ve been saying it could happen at any time. And they are in attack position for some time now, but I’m not going to give you an additional day, hour, moment.

Q Well, just to follow up on that, you have been saying that it’s imminent for some time. You guys stopped for a little bit —

MS. PSAKI: Yeah.

Q — and then you went back to it. Has there been a new warning to the Ukrainians in the last 24 hours or so? Because it seems that CNN and others are reporting that they have shared new intelligence about the threat of just how quickly an attack could happen.

MS. PSAKI: We don’t know what that’s based on. We have been conveying — in close touch with the Ukrainians, we have been conveying that they are capable of operationalizing at any time. That has been the case.

I’d also note that, obviously, our preference would be that President Putin doesn’t further invade. And as I said a few minutes ago, what we’re also assessing is that he has had to adjust, adapt to the strength of the unity of the global community, to what our reaction has been. And he has been forced to need to respond and adapt his own actions.

We will see. We still very much anticipate and predict that he will invade further. But, again, we’re also seeing an impact on how he’s behaving.

Q And on Nord Stream 2: Last month, the White House opposed an effort on Capitol Hill to put sanctions on this pipeline. Last year, of course, President Biden waived the sanctions on that. And now, today, he is imposing the sanctions on it, which is a pretty big shift. So, can you just explain the changes —

MS. PSAKI: We don’t —

Q — and where you stand on that?

MS. PSAKI: Well, we don’t see it as a shift at all. We’ve never supported the pipeline. It was 98 percent built when the President took office. We’ve always spoken out against the pipeline. The question was: What was the most effective step in order to have the result that we have now over the last 24 hours?

And there were calls by some in Congress to do preemptive sanctions on — or earlier sanctions — or take earlier steps, I should say, on Nord Stream 2. We disagreed with that strategy. We worked through a diplomatic path with the Germans. You saw the German Chancellor make the announcement yesterday, and the announcement today was complementary to that.

Q So the change is just because you were waiting on the Germans to take the first step here.

MS. PSAKI: Well, actually, it was that we felt a diplomatic approach would be the most effective pro- — approach, and we have succeeded in our efforts. And we didn’t think the alternative approach was the right one.

Q My last question: A French official recently told the Wall Street Journal that during his last visit, the French President found Putin was “more rigid, isolated, and had basically gone into a sort of ideological and security-minded drift.” The President recently spent about an hour on the phone with him. Obviously, he knows Putin pretty well. I wonder if he has seen a change in the Russian leader.

MS. PSAKI: I don’t have any personal observations by President Biden about President Putin to read out. But I think we all watched, including the President, the speech — or read it — from the other night and saw a leader who was outlining a case for a war to his public — one that was based on revisionist history. And whether that’s based on isolation or not, we’ll leave that to others to assess.

Go ahead.

Q Thank you, Jen. So you’ve said many times today that you — that there is not a new assessment. But yesterday, the President clearly chose his words carefully when he said the world was watching the start of an invasion, which is very different from the U.S. warning today that a full-scale Russian invasion is imminent. So, are you saying that nothing has changed between when we heard from the President yesterday and today?

MS. PSAKI: I’m saying I don’t have — we have been saying for days that there has been — that they are prepared to launch a full-scale invasion. We saw the beginning of that yesterday. So, nothing has changed in that assessment.

Q What about the figure of 80 percent of Russian troops are now in the forward attack position? Was that also the case yesterday?

MS. PSAKI: I don’t — I’m not going to be in a position to give you move- — troop assessments or movements. But as I said just a few minutes ago, we — they are in an attack position. That remains the case.

Q Okay. And then to follow up on something I asked Daleep yesterday, he said that the administration would not give a timeframe for when Americans might feel the impact of this conflict. Why not? I mean, the President has said we need to be honest about the cost of fighting for democracy. Can you share anything about a timeframe, a range? Should people be saving money?

MS. PSAKI: Well, I think, Weijia, there’s been a little confusion about this because, one, the announ- — the sanctions that we announced yesterday will not have an impact on the American people. They will have an impact on the Russian elite, on financial institutions, on individuals who are trying to use those institutions to engage in — with Western banks, including President Putin and his inner circle.

What we’re seeing in the market is an anticipation of a further invasion by President Putin. And what we’re trying to do and focus on is take every step we can, working around the world with our counterparts and partners, to minimize the impact on the global energy market.

So that’s what we’re working on. We’re working on minimizing that, but there is not an impact from the sanctions we’ve announced on the American public. It really depends, in part, on what President Putin does in many regards.

Q And finally, is one of those options looking at releasing more oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve?

MS. PSAKI: That is certainly an option on the table.

Q Thank you.

MS. PSAKI: Go ahead, Peter.

Q Thanks, Jen. Following up on Weijia’s question —

MS. PSAKI: Yeah.

Q A lot of focus on the economic pain in Russia, potentially, from these sanctions, but what about the economic pain here? The Russians are saying they think gas prices in Europe are going to double. How high could they get here?

MS. PSAKI: Well, I think, again, Peter, as I said to Weijia, I mean, some of this depends on what President Putin does. So as he’s suggesting what the impact will be around the world, it’s all based on what his actions are, just to be very clear about it.

What the President is focused on and is working on is taking every step we can to communicate with, coordinate with, engage with big global suppliers around the world to minimize the impact on the energy markets.

Q But even without all this going on, gas in California is almost $5 a gallon. Should people across the country expect to see that kind of a number when they go to gas up their car — $5, $6?

MS. PSAKI: Well, again, I think as you heard the President say last week, standing up for our values is not without cost. What we’re trying to do is minimize that cost. So, I don’t have a prediction of it right now because we’re trying to minimize the impact on the global energy markets.

Q Okay. Something that you said — two different things that you’ve said so far today: You said you think right now Putin is improvising and adapting. But you’ve also said that you very much anticipate and predict that he’s going to invade further.

So, which is it: Is he adapting, or is he still invading?

MS. PSAKI: Think big here, Peter. He can still be preparing to invade — which we’ve said, and that continues to be the case — while making adaptations on when, if, how to, what his strategy is. That’s what we’re seeing. Both are true.

Q But — so if that’s what you’re seeing — he announced sanctions yesterday —

MS. PSAKI: Yeah.

Q Did any Russian military units turn around and head back towards Russia?

MS. PSAKI: Again, I’m not going to get into assessments from here of movements of any military. But also, what we’re trying to do is prevent a war, prevent devastation on the Ukrainian people. And we’re already seeing the impact on the economy in Russia. We’re going to continue to make clear that there are much — that as — if he continues to escalate, we will as well.

Q And as we wait to see if or how Russia might retaliate against the U.S., the FBI is reportedly warning businesses about cybersecurity risks. So why did you say there is no current threat as it relates to cyber here?

MS. PSAKI: There is no current threat as it relates to cyber here. The FBI and all of the agencies in the government always provide regular updates on what businesses and entities should do to prepare for the potential for. There is still no immediate specific threat.

Q But on Friday, the Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber came in here to say, “We don’t have the level of cyber resilience that we wish.” Why would somebody come to the White House briefing room and talk about that if there is no threat?

MS. PSAKI: Because we anticipate that there could be continuing threats in the future, and what we need private sector companies to do is harden their cybersecurity capabilities now. Now is the time to do it.

Q Okay. And then, finally, the State Department spokesman today said you guys are doing everything you reasonably can to prevent human rights abuses, atrocities, and potential war crimes in Ukraine. How can you say that if all that you’re announcing is financial punishment?

MS. PSAKI: That isn’t all we’re announcing. We have provided a range of assistance to Ukraine — humanitarian assistance, security assistance — the most of any year in history. We will continue to build on all of this assistance. We are plussing-up support for our partners and Allies in the region to ensure they know we have our ba- — their backs and we are abiding by our NATO obligations.

And we continue to also provide — I think what he was referring to is a range of public information as well — to make clear what the intentions are of the Russians, to call them out for the type of actions we could see them taking in the future.

Go ahead.

Q Jen, if I can ask you about Nord Stream 2 to have a little better understanding of this right now.

MS. PSAKI: Sure. Yeah.

Q Can you say — we’ve seen the sanctions. Can you say declaratively that this pipeline will never be operational, that this is effectively dead?

MS. PSAKI: Well, we — not only did the Chancellor of Germany announce it’s not moving forward, we also announced additional sanctions today. And it is not moving forward right now, no.

Q So would you say — but just for clarity, you say it’s not moving forward right now. But there have been some concern among some critics that though he did announce the suspension, that, at a later date, that Chancellor Scholz could say, “Yes, we are going to begin the process again.”

So, when you say “right now,” that means right now; that doesn’t mean for perpetuity?

MS. PSAKI: It’s currently dead at the bottom of the sea, Peter. I’m not going to get ahead of where we are in the process. It is not happening. It’s not moving forward. It hasn’t been operational for some time.

So, that is where it stands. And this is all the result of diplomatic engagement and leadership by the President and his engagement with Chancellor Scholz.

Q Let me ask you about some other security issues as best you’re able to detail.

MS. PSAKI: Yeah.

Q I know there’s some things you can’t discuss. So, without detailing specifics that you can’t discuss, what role is the U.S. playing in securing President Zelenskyy’s safety? And does the U.S. bear some responsibility in making sure that he is safe?

MS. PSAKI: I’m not going to detail our conversations or engagements about security with the President of Ukraine, who remains in Kyiv and is continuing to lead the country.



Q Do we bear some responsibility, though, for making sure — without detailing what you’re doing, do we bear some responsibility for making sure that he is safe?



MS. PSAKI: We are going to continue to engage with him privately. I’m not going to detail or speak to it further from here.



Q If I could ask you just a last quick question.



MS. PSAKI: Sure.



Q Is there any circumstance — obviously, we’re focusing so much on Ukraine, as evidenced by these questions. Is there any circumstance in which the President would hold his announcement of a Supreme Court pick after February?



MS. PSAKI: No.



Q Declaratively, it’ll happen before then.



MS. PSAKI: Yes.



Q Has he made a decision yet?



MS. PSAKI: I don’t have any updates on that.



Go ahead.

Q Since it’s been asked a few different times, but just to clarify: You and other officials have said that the purpose of withholding additional and harsher sanctions is so that they have a deterrent effect.



MS. PSAKI: Yeah.



Q But at the same time, you’re saying that a broader invasion is likely.

So how are both of those true, if the idea is that they would have a deterrent effect?



MS. PSAKI: Well, we’re trying to prevent that from happening, and we are making very clear what — how impactful and serious what we’re considering, in terms of additional sanctions, could be.



Q And are — is inflation playing a role at all in deciding, you know, what gets sanctioned, what — how you’re thinking about the sanctions package?

MS. PSAKI: Inflation in the United States, I assume you’re referring to?



Q Global inflation.



MS. PSAKI: Look, I think we look at a range of factors. And I’ll use the energy markets as an example, because I know that was a question that was asked yesterday. It’s a good one.



You know, as we look at what sectors we’re going to sanction, one of the factors we look at is what can have the biggest impact, of course, on Russian leadership, people around President Putin, on the Russian economy. What we’re trying to minimize is what impact there’s going to be on the United States and global markets, in a lot of ways.



And if you look at energy — the energy sector as an example, sanctioning them further could also mean that President Putin and people around him get richer.



So we look at a range of factors and, certainly, the impact on the global economy is a factor as we consider options.



Go ahead.



Q If Russia does launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, should we expect to hear from the President, as we have in the last few days?



MS. PSAKI: I would expect you would, yes.



Q And he would address the nation in some televised fashion?

MS. PSAKI: I would expect you would hear from the President, as you have.

Q And then, can you explain a little bit more for people who are trying to follow this continuing situation with Russia and Ukraine, why would the U.S. not directly sanction Putin at this time?

MS. PSAKI: It remains an option on the table. What I would say to people who are trying to understand why is that sanctions are designed to — we’ve always designed them to increase, be escalatory. That would be an escalatory step, as would be sanctioning the largest banks — the very largest banks and additional components of the financial sector, as would taking export control steps be. So, there’s a range of escalatory steps we have as options.



Go ahead.



Q You mentioned the sanctions on oligarchs at the top, and the President was a little unclear in his wording yesterday. He said that sanctions on Russian elites wouldn’t start until today; that was crossed out in the transcript to yesterday. The reason I’m asking is, as part of the, sort of, first tranche —



MS. PSAKI: Yeah.



Q — of sanctions, are we going to see more elites sanctioned, or would that only happen if Russia takes additional escalatory steps?

MS. PSAKI: I can check if there are additional ones. I’m not tracking additional ones that we’re holding for a rollout.



I will note, on your first part of your question, that for the elites — individuals, if they were to have used their fi- — their bank card, I guess, to make a financial transaction, it wouldn’t have been working yesterday.

Q There was a cyberattack on Ukrainian government websites today.



MS. PSAKI: Yeah.



Q I know the NSC has already said that it was sort of similar to the one that we saw on Ukrainian banks earlier and would be in keeping with what you expect from Russia. But I’m wondering if, at this point, you’ve made a definitive determination if Russia was responsible, and, if so, if you have any sort of retaliation — or response to that announcement.



MS. PSAKI: Yeah, we have not — we have not attributed today’s activity yet. That would be very fast — even fast for us, as fast as last week was.

We do consider it, as I think some of my NSC colleagues said, to be consistent with the type of activity Russia would carry out in a bid to destabilize Ukraine. It’s consistent with what we saw last week, where we attributed similar incidents to the Russian government. And we, of course, consider these further incidents to be consistent with a type of activity we’ve seen Russia take over the course of time.



We are in conversation with Ukraine regarding the cyber-related needs, including as recently as today. And we’re going to move with urgency to assess the nature and extent of this, what steps needs to be taken, and, therefore, our response.

Q And then the President has got a meeting — a virtual meeting with the G7 tomorrow morning.



MS. PSAKI: Yeah.



Q Obviously, I think the topic is going to be Ukraine —



MS. PSAKI: Yeah.



Q — but I was wondering if you could put any meat on the bone, in terms of what the President is trying to — what his objective is in that — in that meeting on what he’s looking to accomplish.



MS. PSAKI: Well, one of the steps the President has been focused on is ensuring that we are coordinated with key allies and partners around the world, and certainly the G7 is an important entity to remain very closely engaged with.

The G7 is 50 percent of the world’s economy and joined us — all of them — in this first tranche of sanctions announced yesterday.



The President isn’t a believer that this level of coordination happens by accident; it happens through a lot of work and in close engagement. We’re obviously at a pivotal point in this — in this process, and so he felt tomorrow was a time to discuss with them what we’re seeing, what it looks like, what’s next, and engage in this format.



Go ahead.



Q So, a couple of questions. On this first tranche of sanctions, have what’s going to be announced in that first batch been announced, or will we see more things today?



MS. PSAKI: The first tranche has been announced. And, obviously, the Nord Stream 2 announcement today is an additional part of that. I can certainly check if there’s anything additional coming at this point beyond for the first tranche — not that I am aware of, but I will check and make sure that’s correct.

Q And then, when you all talk about this first tranche of sanctions, can you give us a sense of, like, how many tranches — if that’s the right word — are in this toolbox that you have to apply? You know, how many sets of sanctions are we talking about?



MS. PSAKI: I understand the question. It’s hard for me to give that assessment. It really depends on what escalatory actions President Putin takes. If he goes further, we will go further. What that looks like, I can’t outline for you at this point in time.



I gave you the sense, a little bit, of what some additional options are — right? — export controls; sanctioning additional financial institutions, larger financial institutions. Those are all on the table, as are other options.



But in terms of what the breakdown of tranches would look like, I can’t outline that from — for you at this point from here.

Q And in terms of the cyberattack, which you just were asked about, does — will the U.S. or could we expect the U.S. to have some sort of retaliatory behavior towards Russia in response to this?

MS. PSAKI: We always reserve that option and, obviously, we haven’t made an attribution for this recent DDoS attack. As we go through the process of doing that, we’ll certainly consider what actions could be taken as well.

Q Can I ask one final question, actually, on the JCPOA?



MS. PSAKI: Sure.



Q There have been reports that the U.S., Iran is reaching, closing in on some sort of deal. Would you all confirm that that is an accurate assessment — that you are inching towards a potential deal this week?



MS. PSAKI: Well, what we’re seeing is there is significant progress being made, and we are close to a possible deal. But there are a number of very difficult issues that remain unresolved. And there’s very little time remaining to reach a deal given the pace of Iran’s nuclear advances.



Also, I would note that typically the most difficult components — the last mile — is where it — where there is the most difficult conversations and negotiations.



So, yes, significant progress and we are close. But there’s a lot that still needs to be worked out.



It is true that Iran — we believe if Iran shows seriousness, we can and should reach an understanding on mutual return to full implementation of the JCPOA within — potentially within days. But there is still more work that needs to be done.

Q So you all are optimistic or — I mean, that’s a mixed (inaudible)?



MS. PSAKI: We are — we are encouraged by the significant progress, but, having been through a few of these, I would note that, often, the most difficult negotiations happen in the — in the last portion.



Go ahead. Go ahead, Zolan.



Q Thanks, Jen. So, following up on the Nord Stream, just — I’m wondering if anything happened. I understand you were saying that there was an intent to want to do this in a coordinated way with the Germans and, obviously, they made their action yesterday. But was there anything else that happened on the ground in Ukraine yesterday that warranted the sanction happening today rather than yesterday?

MS. PSAKI: No, it — but it’s part of our first tranche of sanctions, so we would see it as a part of what was rolled out yesterday.

Q And then, you were also telling — I think you told Kaitlan that you wanted this approach with Germany rather than an alternative. Just looking at, you know, the President last year said, in Cincinnati, that construction is already kind of going at this point. I believe the exact quote —



MS. PSAKI: Yeah, 90 percent of it. Yeah.



Q Right. Right. He was saying 90 percent. So why is this a better way, a more effective way than issuing sanctions unilaterally and then possibly pressuring the Germans to take action themselves?

MS. PSAKI: Well, it hasn’t been operational, which is an important component, right? It’s not like oil has been flowing through Nord Stream 2, which is a very important component here. And we made the assessment — others can have different assessments — that this would be the way to achieve the outcome that we’ve now achieved. Others can have different assessments. There’s no proof or evidence that their approach would have worked. Ours has worked.

Q More so the question was: Why would not issuing sanctions last year, earlier — why wouldn’t have that been effective? Why is this approach —

MS. PSAKI: Because we felt working in coordination with our German counterparts through a diplomatic process would be the most effective way to approach it.

Q And then a pivot — just two more. Can you outline what exactly Doug Jones has been doing in terms of the SCOTUS process, who he’s been talking to on the Hill?



Lastly, the March 18th mask mandate for travel, just — is the administration considering extending that or is that seen as an expiration date?



MS. PSAKI: Sure. On the first, I’m sure once there is an announcement to be made, we will have more detail about all of the engagements that have led up to it. But certainly, Senator Jones is playing an integral role engaging with senators, engaging with different stakeholders and individuals who want to — to give their view on where this should head. I’m sure we’ll have more details once an announcement is made.



As it relates to the March 18th timeline, the CDC is in the process of reviewing their mask guidelines and their mask guidance. We will let them make any announcements on that. But I don’t have anything to predict at this point about March 18th and the — and where that stands on planes.



Go ahead.



Q Yeah, thanks, Jen. Earlier during today’s briefing, you said it’s the U.S.’s assessment that President Putin did not expect the U.S. to have this level of information that we have, did not expect us to put out the amount of information that we put out, and did not expect the global community to be as unified as it is. What have you seen from Putin’s actions, from Russia’s actions that have led to that conclusion, that assessment?

MS. PSAKI: Well, I think why I was conveying that is because what we’ve seen — and I don’t think I can give much more detail than that, other than to say what we’ve seen is him adjusting and adapting some of his actions and needing to respond to what our actions are.

And we’ve obviously been making a — assessing that he is prepared to operationalize at any time. That has not changed. But, you know, we are also watching closely what he does.

Q And what’s your response — the administration’s response to lawmakers from both sides of the aisle who say President Biden still hasn’t gone far enough with sanctions?

Representative Adam Schiff yesterday said, quote, “…the administration must go further.”

Today, Senator Graham called the administration’s initial response “inadequate,” and he said, “Let’s quickly up our game.”



So what is the strategy behind holding back some of these larger sanction possibilities that you’ve talked about?

MS. PSAKI: Well, our strategy has been start high, which is certainly what we did. We did not sanction a major bank or financial institution back in 2014. This is a farther step than that.

As I noted a little bit earlier, we also sanctioned not just oligarchs but also family members around them to cut off their ability to preserve their funding and financing. And our approach and our strategy has been to preserve a range of sanctions and options that we can also escalate to, should we need to.

Obviously, our preference is that President Putin deescalates.

Q But if Russia does invade further — as, you know, there are indications that it could — does that mean that those sanctions imposed yesterday, imposed today were a failure?

MS. PSAKI: Well, again, part of them were a cost. Part of them is an effort to prevent a war. We’re doing that not alone but in coordination with our partners and Allies around the world. That is the way to do it. That is the strong way to do it. That is the effective way to do it.

There may be others who have different points of view. They’re welcome. It’s a free country. They can have those points of view.

But our approach has been, to date, to respond with strong sanctions, to start high and build from there. And that is what we will continue to do if he escalates.

Q And then, lastly, on the Supreme Court nomination process, can you confirm that the interviews are now finished ahead of an announcement before the end of the month?

MS. PSAKI: I’m not going to confirm any details about the process. I would note that we are five days away from the end of February, if my math is correct. The interviews are typically late stage in the process. So, we are getting close to an announcement.

Go ahead.

Q Thanks, Jen. I want to ask about food prices. But, first, a quick question about Ukraine. Just a short while ago, separatists in eastern Ukraine formally asked President Putin for military help. Is that a signal that the U.S. expects a broader invasion is about to begin?

MS. PSAKI: Well, I think as we’ve said from the beginning, there are going to be a range of false-flag operations that we have expected to and laid out the playbook to see. This is an example of it. That is suggesting that they feel under threat. By whom — the Ukrainians that the Russians are threatening to attack?

So, we’ll continue to call out what we see as false-flag operations or efforts to spread disinformation about what the actual status is on the ground.

Q And Americans, they just experienced their most expensive Thanksgiving. This conflict will likely drive up food prices, grocery prices. What does the White House minimizing the impact of even higher grocery prices actually look like?

MS. PSAKI: I don’t think we’ve ever minimized the higher impact of the costs of food. I would note —

Q (Inaudible) but you’re going to minimize the impact.

MS. PSAKI: I would note — let me finish. Factually, I think the price of a turkey just a couple of months ago was about $1 more, if we just look back at the facts of what was actually happening at the time. And we’ve talked a bit in here about our concerns about meat conglomerates jacking up the prices — if people go into the store and they try to buy a pound or two pounds of meat — what we’re seeing as the impact of not enough competition in the industry.

But the President has repeatedly expressed concern about costs for the American people. That’s one of the reasons he continues to press for steps with Congress that will lower significant costs on people’s budgets, whether it’s childcare, healthcare, eldercare, whatever it may be. That is a central part of his economic agenda.

Go ahead.

Q Thanks, Jen. You’ve said and the President has said several times that, you know — to Americans — that the U.S. is not sending the military into Ukraine, not going to war with Russia. And I just wanted to ask, given that your warning of a full-fledged invasion with potential attacks on Kyiv, how the administration is as confident as it is that that won’t become necessary at some point, that there won’t be any need down the road for military engagement with Russia?

MS. PSAKI: That is not a decision the President is going to make.

Q Based on?

MS. PSAKI: We are not going to be in a war with Russia or putting military troops on the ground in Ukraine fighting Russia.

Q So, ultimately, if Vladimir Putin takes all of Ukraine, that’s a situation that the administration is not — going to condemn, obviously; going to punish, economically — but that’s not something that will be engaged militarily.

MS. PSAKI: Well, that is several steps down the road. But what I will tell you is the President has been crystal clear and consistent: He is not sending U.S. troops to fight in Ukraine. That has not changed.

Q Has there been any discussion on the strategy of saying that, though, so publicly and potentially giving Putin an indication that the U.S. and NATO Allies are willing to cede that sphere of influence outside of NATO boundaries to him?

MS. PSAKI: Again, I don’t know how many more times I can say it: There’s no scenario — the President is not sending U.S. troops to fight in Ukraine against Russia. We are taking a range of other steps, as you’ve touched on, but, I would say, they’re quite significant.

Not only are we the largest provider of security assistance, humanitarian assistance, and economic assistance to Ukraine, but we have also taken significant steps to plus up not only our NATO forces and our force posture but the force posture of our partners in Eastern Europe to make sure they know we have their backs and support them.

We will continue to plus this all up. But the President is not sending U.S. troops to fight in Ukraine. That hasn’t changed.

Go ahead.

Q Thanks, Jen. This is a little bit related to Eli’s question. So, it’s very clear what Russian escalation could be, right? Go from today to, you know, the whole of Ukraine, or bombarding Kyiv, or — there’s a lot of things along the way.

You’ve laid out all sorts of different sanctions that are being considered.

MS. PSAKI: Yeah.

Q But what is the arc — because it’s very clear what the Russian arc could be, right? It could ultimately go to whatever, you know, occupying the whole of Ukraine. What is the arc of the U.S. response? Like what’s — what’s the equivalent to, you know, smashing Kyiv to pieces?

MS. PSAKI: Again, I’m not going to outline “if this, then that” from here. And I — unless you know something the rest of us don’t know, I don’t know that anyone knows exactly what the next step will be.

As much as we’re preparing, we’re seeing them positioning their military forces for attack. Obviously, until they further invade, they haven’t further invaded, right? If they do and take escalatory steps, we will take escalatory steps. What those look like will depend a lot on what the actions are.

Q Okay. And one other question, please. You’ve got the G7 virtual meeting tomorrow. The President has made a lot of outreach to allies, obviously.

MS. PSAKI: Yeah.

Q Is any consideration whatsoever being given to some kind of last-ditch outreach to the Russians, either from the President or him encouraging the Europeans to have another go at it?

MS. PSAKI: Well, I’ve talked about this a little bit yesterday. I mean, a couple of days ago, obviously, the President made clear — or we made clear on his behalf that if they didn’t invade, that he was open to ha- — engaging with President Putin, and that would follow a meeting or engagement between our Secretary of State and Foreign Minister Lavrov.

Obviously, we’re in a different point at this point in time, and it doesn’t feel appropriate or the right step to have those diplomatic engagements right now. We will always leave the door open. If they de-escalate, we will certainly proceed with diplomatic engagement.

But, no, we’re not considering a meeting with President Putin or engagement with him right now.

Go ahead.

Q Hi, I have a question on Mexico but, first, on Ukraine —

MS. PSAKI: Sure.

Q On the sanctions on Nord Stream AG, can you confirm that they will only affect gas from and not the four European companies that are shareholders of the consortium?

MS. PSAKI: I think we put out an extensive statement on this, as well as some details. I can — let me see if I can just outline it all from you — from here, and we can get that to you after the briefing as well.

What was your other question?

Q Yeah, on Mexico, the President of Mexico said today that the U.S. isn’t well informed about violence against journalists in Mexico and the recent impunity for those crimes. Are you worried that he’s downplaying the risks that journalists face in that country?

MS. PSAKI: Well, I would say, first, we’ve seen, factually, the threats that have been posed to journalists in Mexico. And we’ve seen the threats, we’ve seen — and that is a concern that I think the Secretary of State was expressing on behalf of the United States about those abuses. So, I think he was speaking to facts we’ve seen on the ground.

Go ahead.

Q Hi, Jen. A couple of domestic questions for you. First, does the White House have any reaction to the order from Texas Governor Abbott calling for prosecutions of parents who move forward with gender-affirming treatments for their kids?

MS. PSAKI: Well, I spoke a little bit, unfortunately, to another law that we saw moving in Florida just last week. And — but let me reiterate some of the points I made then.

There are efforts in some states — not just Texas, but also Florida and unfortunately others — designed to target and attack the kids who need support the most: LGBTQI+ students who are already vulnerable to bullying and violence just for being themselves.

This isn’t an isolated action, as is evidenced by multiple states pursuing this. We’re seeing Republican leaders take actions to regulate what students can or cannot read, what they can or cannot learn, and, most troubling, who they can or cannot be.

You’ve heard the President — he also, I think, put out a tweet or — I think — or a statement to the Florida law. And I would say we have the same concerns about these type of actions we’re seeing in Texas.

Q And then, in Florida, Governor DeSantis’s administration is moving forward with the rule targeting shelters that house unaccompanied minors. Does the Biden administration have any contingency plans for the unaccompanied minors who may be affected by that rule, in terms of their

housing?

MS. PSAKI: Well, I think this is an important thing to call — to call out here, because what we’re talking about here is, one, it’s our view — it’s our responsibility, I should say, as an administration to responsibly and safely care for unaccompanied children. We’re talking about minor kids here.

So HHS is currently examining all legal options available at its disposal to ensure that our shelters continue to provide services to the unaccompanied minor — minors in our care.

I would remind you all that there have been kids in Florida in these facilities since 2005 — I mean, these facilities have been open for 17 years now, being overseen by the Office of Refugee Resettlement.

So, we’re obviously looking at legal options here. But I also would say this is — you know, really flies in the face of what should be a moral view of anyone that taking — caring for — the safe care for unaccompanied children should be a part of what we all want to be active participants in.



Go ahead.

Q Thanks, Jen. So, the Justice Department today announced that they are ending the Trump administration’s 2018 China Initiative and replacing it with a broader approach towards, you know, more countries — Russia, Iran, North Korea.

I know that Justice officials have spoken about this, but if you can elaborate from this podium the reasoning behind that, and especially in addressing the complaints of discrimination from Asian Americans.

MS. PSAKI: I would have to dig further into this, Patsy. I’d really point you to the Department of Justice. I’m not sure we have more to add from here.

Q And then, just on the global pandemic response, can you confirm the amount of funding that the administration has requested from Congress? We’re hearing this number of $5 billion that activists say is not nearly enough to help vaccinate the world, as well as to stop new variants from, you know, attacking the U.S. as well.

MS. PSAKI: Well, I don’t — well, I don’t have any specific numbers; we’re still in conversation with the Hill at this point about funding and funding needs, both domestically and internationally.

We want to continue to be the provider of not just vaccines but vaccine know-how and assistance to the global community. We don’t believe that COVI- — that the pandemic sees borders. And we know that in order to continue to get it under control, we need to be the leader in the world on this effort. But numbers are still being discussed with the Hill, so I don’t have any more specifics, unfortunately.

Q And just really quickly on Ukraine: Are you, at this point, urging Americans to leave Russia? I know that — I think, two days ago the embassy in Moscow is issuing an advisory saying — for Americans to have evacuation plans that do not rely on government assistance. But are you actually telling Americans in Russia to leave Russia right now?

MS. PSAKI: The State Department makes those assessments and recommendations, and they update them regularly, so I’d point to them for any updates.

Go ahead.

Q Thank you, Jen. A few on Ukraine. First, the Kremlin has vowed countersanctions in response to the U.S. We’ve not seen what those will look like, but it sounds like the U.S. has quite a bit of intelligence, so I’m wondering if you have any view on what the nature of those countersanctions could be, what impact they could have on consumers, and how the administration could offset that?

MS. PSAKI: Well, we’ve seen those threats or those reports, but I don’t have anything to provide or assess from here.

Q And then, yesterday, President Biden said, “Nothing in Putin’s lengthy remarks indicated any interest in pursuing real dialogue on European security in the year 2022.”



MS. PSAKI: Mm-hmm.



Q If that’s the case, what do you see as the endgame here?



MS. PSAKI: Well, again, our hope is that Putin will decide to de-escalate: that he will feel the threat of the sanctions, what the impact will be on the Russian economy, on the Russian people, on the people who surround him — they are meant to have a deterrent impact; that he will feel the weight of being a pariah in the global community.

It does not mean — we have never closed the door to diplomacy, and the President didn’t have that intention of conveying that yesterday either. And, certainly, if it is an appropriate time, he will engage with President Putin again. But now is not the appropriate time, where he’s continuing to invade a sovereign country.

Q And, finally, the administration is working on putting its budget together.

MS. PSAKI: Yeah.

Q How much humanitarian assistance for Ukraine is the administration prepared to support?

MS. PSAKI: It’s a good question. What we’re going to — and it’s hard for me to give you a number right now, because we’re going to continue to assess the needs on the — on the ground. And we certainly are prepared for the potential for there to be major humanitarian — continued humanitarian needs on the ground. Obviously, those existed — have existed since back to 2014.

But we want to continue to be the largest provider of humanitarian assistance. This is something we will continue to discuss with colleagues in Congress as well.

Q Thanks, Jen.

MS. PSAKI: All right. Okay. Thanks everyone. We’ll do this again tomorrow.

Q Supreme Court, Jen? Supreme Court, real fast, Jen?

MS. PSAKI: Yes, ma’am.

Q And going back to what Peter asked —

MS. PSAKI: Sure.

Q This — this small window — and in the midst of this window, you have a lot going on with foreign policy.

MS. PSAKI: We do.

Q Yes.

MS. PSAKI: It means you guys have a lot going on, too. All of us.

Q Yes. Right. How about that?

With that said, how is the President feeling in the midst of all this as it relates to this impending nomination — this historic nomination that he’s getting ready for make?

MS. PSAKI: And tell me more about what you mean, “How is he feeling?”

Q How is he feeling? I mean, he’s got all of this going on —

MS. PSAKI: Yeah.

Q — with Ukraine and Russia. And then he’s got this historic nomination of the first Black woman to potentially sit on the U.S. Supreme Court. It’s history being made in the midst of looking at sanctions and other things that are happening overseas. How’s he feeling about this piece over here?

MS. PSAKI: Yes, I mean, I think the President is looking forward to announcing a historic, eminently qualified Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court. He has — feels there’s tremendous honor in that.

He takes the role that every President has in selecting and nominating someone to the Supreme Court very seriously. That’s why he has been spending time not just studying bios, but also reviewing cases and engaging very closely with an internal team on this process.

But he is very much looking forward to making this announcement and getting this individual confirmed.

Q How many nominees has he met with thus far?

MS. PSAKI: I’m not going to get into further detail on that. I expect once he makes an announcement, we’ll have more details to share.

Q And lastly —

MS. PSAKI: Yeah

Q — the administration has been fervrent — fervor — fervent — I can’t even get the word out — saying that they will — that you all will fight against anyone who tries to mar or ruin the reputation of any of these nominees.

MS. PSAKI: Yeah.

Q What are you willing to do in this fight to keep their reputations that they walked into this process with?

MS. PSAKI: That’s a good question, April. I think what we mean by that is: There are a range of eminently qualified Black women whose names have been out there as potential nominees — all of these women would make tremendous additions to the Supreme Court — and we have also seen efforts to mar their reputations.

And what we mean by that is we are going to fight back — even before, obviously, the President has made a decision or made an announcement — against efforts to tar any of their reputations. That means defending them publicly, standing up for them, providing information to — to, you know, debunk any information that’s being put out about them that’s inaccurate. And hopefully they all feel that we have — we have delivered on that promise. But that has been important to the President from the beginning.

Q Thank you.

MS. PSAKI: Thank you, everyone. See you tomorrow or whenever.

The United States announced a deal with European leaders on Friday to increase shipments of natural gas to help wean Europe off Russian energy. And Germany set an ambitious goal of halving its imports of Russian oil and coal this year and freeing itself from its dependence on Russian natural gas by the middle of 2024.

Germany’s timelines, outlined by its vice chancellor, are a remarkable turnabout by Europe’s largest economy, which has long relied extensively on Russia for energy. Just a few months ago, Germany was still aiming to buy even more natural gas from Moscow through a new pipeline called Nord Stream 2.

But President Vladimir V. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has forced leaders in Germany and other European countries to rip up the energy playbook they had used for years, decades even, in just a month. The German vice chancellor, Robert Habeck, said at a briefing in Berlin that his country was shifting away from Russian energy at an “insane pace.”

President Biden is seeking to encourage similar moves by other European countries, in part by offering up the United States as an energy supplier.

The deal he announced, in Brussels earlier on Friday, lacked many details but contained some big goals: The United States would send an additional 15 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas to Europe this year — roughly 10 to 12 percent of current annual U.S. exports to all countries. By 2030, the president said, the United States will aim to increase supplies by as much as 50 billion cubic meters a year.

The moves caught many in the U.S. energy industry by surprise. Oil and gas executives who have become accustomed to being pilloried for their contributions to climate change were suddenly being called up to help liberate European allies from Russian energy. While the industry was not certain how Europe would make such a giant pivot, executives clearly relished their new casting as saviors rather than villains.

“I have no idea how they are going to do this, but I don’t want to criticize them, because for the first time they are trying to do the right thing,” said Charif Souki, the executive chairman of Tellurian, a U.S. gas producer that is planning to build an export terminal in Louisiana.

Mr. Biden and the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said many of the specifics would be worked out by a task force dedicated to reducing Europe’s dependency on Russian oil and gas in ways that would not undermine the climate policies of the two partners.

Among the things they did not address was the shortage of port capacity to ship and receive more gas on both sides of the Atlantic. The effort could also struggle because the Biden administration can’t simply order U.S. exporters to sell gas to European buyers or to set prices acceptable to those buyers.

“We’re going to have to make sure that families in Europe can get through this winter and the next while we’re building an infrastructure for a diversified, resilient and clean energy future,” Mr. Biden said.

The European Union is heavily reliant on energy imports from Russia, a big producer of oil, diesel, coal and, perhaps most important, natural gas. That dependence has become a growing problem as the European Union seeks to punish Mr. Putin. Russia provides about 40 percent of Europe’s natural gas, and a sizable chunk of it is shipped by pipeline through Ukraine.

Germany has long been one of Russia’s biggest customers. Having decided to shut down its nuclear plants, Germany has increasingly relied on natural gas. Because it got relatively affordable gas by pipeline from Russia — and some from the Netherlands, Norway and other suppliers — it declined to build any terminals where liquefied natural gas could be imported.

Germany also imports nearly a third of its crude oil from Russia. It has been trying to slash its consumption with generous subsidies for electric cars and greater investment in public transportation.

The Ukraine war has accelerated such German efforts under Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who leads a coalition government made up of conservatives, liberals and environmentalists. Germany this year has revived plans to build gas importing terminals and has suspended final approvals of Nord Stream 2, an almost-complete pipeline that would have fed it a steady supply of Russian gas.

“Every supply contract that is terminated hurts Putin,” Mr. Habeck said on Friday.

Later in the day, E.U. countries agreed to jointly purchase and store natural gas. They set a target of filling 80 percent of their underground gas storage facilities by November as a buffer against supply disruptions during winter, when gas use increases for heating.

In the United States, gas exporters were already shifting sales to Europe from Asia in recent months, largely because prices in Europe have been higher than almost anywhere else in the world because of rising tensions with Russia and, more recently, the war in Ukraine. Nearly 75 percent of U.S. L.N.G. exports have gone to Europe so far this year, up from 34 percent in 2021. The Biden administration has encouraged that shift by relaxing export restrictions to certain European countries.

Charlie Riedl, the executive director at the Center for Liquefied Natural Gas, a trade group, said he thought an extra 15 billion cubic feet of U.S. gas exports to Europe could be achieved relatively easily. He said two-thirds of that total could come from diverting shipments that otherwise would be bound for Asia, and the rest could come from recent federal approvals for additional production from existing American L.N.G. export terminals.

“Obviously it’s a positive sign that Europe is making attempts to wean itself off Russian gas,” Mr. Riedl said.

Energy executives say the Biden administration could help increase the flow of gas by streamlining permitting for new U.S. export terminals, where natural gas is chilled into a liquid and pumped into oceangoing tankers. Washington and the European Union could also provide loan guarantees for U.S. export terminals and European import terminals. There are roughly a dozen U.S. export terminals that have won regulatory approval but need financing to be built. About 10 European import terminals are being built.

Executives complain it can take more time to obtain permits for pipelines and export terminals than to build them.

Export terminals require investments of up to $10 billion, while import terminals cost about $1 billion to build. The United States has seven export terminals, and Europe has 28 large-scale import terminals.

Environmentalists criticized Mr. Biden’s announcement because they fear it will commit the United States and Europe to using fossil fuels for decades longer than they argue is sustainable given the growing toll of climate change.

“There is no way to ramp up U.S. L.N.G. exports and deliver on the imperative climate commitments that the U.S. and E.U. have pledged,” said Abigail Dillen, the president of Earthjustice, an environmental law organization. She warned that the buildup of L.N.G. infrastructure would “lock in expensive fossil dependence and dangerous pollution for decades to come.”

American and European officials also agreed to seek ways to decrease greenhouse gas emissions from L.N.G. infrastructure and pipelines and to reduce the release of methane from gas operations. They said they would ramp up energy efficiency initiatives, such as the deployment of heat pumps and the use of clean hydrogen technologies to displace fossil fuels, as well as expedite planning and approval of renewable energy projects such as offshore wind and solar power.

The Biden administration has banned Russian energy imports as part of a set of sanctions against Mr. Putin, a relatively easy step for the United States because it is a net exporter of energy. Some U.S. lawmakers would like the European Union to stop buying oil and gas from Russia altogether, but the prospect for that has been dismissed by several E.U. leaders, who see it as a financially disastrous step that would hurt Europe more than Russia.

Some energy experts said a further escalation of the war, such as a decision by Mr. Putin to use chemical, biological or nuclear weapons, could leave the European Union with little choice but to bar the purchase of Russian energy.

“We want as Europeans to diversify away from Russia, toward suppliers that we trust, that are friends and that are reliable,” Ms. von der Leyen of the European Commission said at the announcement with Mr. Biden. “Therefore the U.S. commitment to provide the European Union with an additional at least 15 billion cubic meters of L.N.G. this year is a big step in this direction, because this will replace the L.N.G. supply we currently receive from Russia.”

Still, oil and gas executives said Mr. Biden and Ms. von der Leyen would have to be patient and recognize that decisions on who sold gas to whom would be made across negotiating tables by private companies, not by politicians. Ultimately, exporters will seek to sell their gas to buyers willing to pay the highest price.

“This is a capitalist system,” Mr. Souki, the Tellurian executive, said. “It’s people like me who make those decisions. The government can’t tell us where to send the gas.”

7,a3a8e7f1-d482-401b-93fc-43ed7bebb465,[],,"VIENNA, 24 February 2022 – Referring to the Russian military operation in Ukraine as “indefensible” and a “gross violation of international law,” OSCE parliamentarians gathered in the hybrid Winter Meeting urged an immediate end to the hostilities and a return to diplomacy. Some 28 parliamentarians took the floor in an open debate, with most expressing clear opposition to the incursion and deep concern for the lives of civilians in Ukraine.

Opening the discussion, OSCE Chairman-in-Office and Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau, OSCE PA President Margareta Cederfelt, and President of the Austrian Parliament Wolfgang Sobotka reiterated the role of the OSCE in facilitating dialogue and building confidence.

In his remarks, President Sobotka said that Austria condemns Russia’s attacks on the territorial integrity of Ukraine, emphasizing that the international community can never concede that “might makes right.” The twisting of history, he said, cannot negate the right of Ukraine to its sovereignty. “Today the OSCE principles are being violated on a broad spectrum,” Sobotka said. “Our hope is that diplomatic relations should be able to turn the tide and relaunch the Minsk process.” He expressed particular support for the civilians who suffer under hostilities – the ones who suffer first and suffer the most, he said.

Foreign Minister Rau stated, “Russia’s unprovoked all-out invasion against Ukrainian cities and villages constitutes a fundamental breach of the UN Charter and Helsinki Final Act. Invoking article 51 of the UN Charter to justify this crime against humanity is deplorable and shameful. We condemn, in the strongest possible words, this act of aggression.”

“We expect the Russian side to honor its international obligations and commitments. Any sustainable, political solution must fully respect sovereignty, territorial integrity, and independence of Ukraine,” Rau underscored.

President Cederfelt stressed the OSCE PA’s steadfast support for the resolution of the conflict based on core OSCE principles such as the inviolability of frontiers and the indivisibility of security.

“The Russian military invasion of Ukraine is an armed aggression in clear and gross violation of the most basic norms of international law and OSCE principles and commitments,” President Cederfelt said. “Today more than ever, parliamentarians must exercise their oversight role, rather than enable their governments to breach international commitments. Parliaments must be tools for de-escalation, not weapons of confrontation.”

OSCE Secretary General Helga Schmid spoke to the OSCE PA Heads of Delegations, Bureau members, Special Representatives and Chairs of Ad Hoc Committees at the Standing Committee Meeting today. In her remarks, the Secretary General condemned, in the strongest terms, the Russian military action against Ukraine.

“It did not need to be this way. But Russia chose force over dialogue. Dialogue was offered. By the OSCE, by its Polish Chair. By others. Including NATO, the US, and European capitals. Options for dialogue were not exhausted,” Schmid said.

During the open debate in the Joint Session of the General Committees, the Head of the Ukrainian Delegation Mykyta Poturaiev described the situation that his country faces, with large-scale military operations in Ukraine’s biggest cities. He warned that if Ukraine falls, there will be no European security.

Parliamentarians from across the OSCE area expressed alarm over the current security situation, with several remarking that the recent developments represent a major threat to peace not only in Ukraine but the whole of Europe. This is a time for the Parliamentary Assembly to stand with Ukraine, it was stressed. OSCE parliamentarians underscored that the focus now must be on halting the escalation of conflict and preventing a wider war, urging a return to bilateral and multilateral dialogue. Diplomacy remains relevant, it was emphasized, but sanctions were also called for as a deterrent.

Russian parliamentarian Tatiana Kusaiko said that the military operation in Ukraine is intended to protect civilians in Donbas.

The debate was held under the theme Security Guarantees and the Indivisibility of Security in Europe: Role of the OSCE.

Being held today and tomorrow in a blended format with some 50 parliamentarians gathering in-person in Vienna and many more participating online, the Winter Meeting is an opportunity for parliamentarians to interact with the governmental side and executive structures of the OSCE.

The general committees are meeting to discuss the preliminary ideas of committee rapporteurs for their reports and draft resolutions being prepared for this year’s Annual Session in Birmingham, United Kingdom. The OSCE PA’s Committee on Political Affairs and Security, chaired by United States Congressman Richard Hudson, is holding a debate this afternoon on the theme Heightened Tensions in the OSCE Area and the Need for Interparliamentary Dialogue.

Tomorrow, the OSCE PA’s committees on human rights and economic and environmental security will meet for more debates.
