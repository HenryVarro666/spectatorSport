While several major airports around Ukraine have reported shelling, a CNN reporter found Russian troops inside Hostomel Airport Thursday morning, Feb. 24. Hostomel is a small cargo field to the northwest of Kyiv that is also known as Antonov Airport, for the Antonov aircraft company based there.

A wide range of social media videos appeared to capture the attack in real time, with Russian Ka-52 and Ka-50 attack helicopters and Mi-17 troop transports seen swarming over Ukrainian heads. Several pass over identifiable landmarks in Kyiv.

One video emerged of what appears to be the crash of a Ka-52 or Ka-50 in a body of water said to be Vyshhorod, an estuary area just north of Kyiv, and about 10 miles from the Hostomel Airport. The video catches debris impacting into a wide body of water as a large hulk burns, and a parachutist descends behind it under an ejection-style parachute.

The simple, non-steerable parachute that lands near the crash appears to have survival equipment hung below it but no obvious weapons or combat gear, indicative of an ejection. The Russian Ka-52 and 50 models are both equipped with ejection seats, a rarity among helicopters. In the event of an ejection, the rotors above the pilot are blown off with explosive charges to clear a path.

Another video shows a large flight of what look like Mi-17s (or the similar Mi-8s) taking direct ground fire and deploying flares. The Mi-17 ‚Äî the design of which dates to the 1970s ‚Äî can carry about two dozen troops, roughly on par with the United States‚Äô CV-22 Osprey.

The Mi-17s appear to be passing over the curved breakwater of the Kyiv Hydroelectric Power Plant, flying east. That path is on a direct line with Hostomel Airport.

Another widely shared video appears to show the remains of another Ka-52 after a forced landing with extensive battle damage and spent rocket tubes. The helicopter appears to be carrying laser-guided Vikhr air-to-ground missiles. An attached note claiming to have captured the pilot could not be confirmed.

Within hours of President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs authorization of military action in Ukraine, dramatic video hinted at the force of Russia's military hardware.

As Russian forces launched what Ukrainian officials described as a ‚Äúfull-scale attack‚Äù on their homeland Thursday, video captured on the ground showed helicopters swooping over cities. Meanwhile, tanks and other military vehicles rolled out onto streets.

In one video verified by NBC News, helicopters could be seen flying toward Antonov Airport in Hostomel, near Kyiv, as heavy smoke swirled on the horizon.

Helicopters fly toward Antonov Airport in Hostomel near the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Thursday.

‚ÄúAround 20 already flew, can‚Äôt see Ukrainian coat of arms, definitely Russian,‚Äù the person making the recording can be heard saying in Ukrainian.

‚ÄúThey are flying above the houses, they are flying towards the airport, they are bombing the airport ‚Å†‚Äî can hear there is a fight,‚Äù the person says.

In another video, shot from nearby Vyshhorod, helicopters appear to drop flares as they travel over water and then inland.

The Ukrainian interior Ministry‚Äôs spokesman said a number of Russian helicopters were shot down in Hostomel.

Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said more than 40 of the country's soldiers had been killed.

NBC News was not immediately able to confirm the government reports of casualties, battles and troop movements.

For weeks, Russia had been massing tens of thousands of troops along Ukraine's border. And on Thursday Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the country was under attack ‚Äúfrom the south, north, east and from the air.""

Missiles and shelling struck a slew of targets Thursday, including airports and military sites, Ukrainian officials said.

In Vuhledar in the Donetsk region, a Russian shell hit a hospital, killing four people and injuring 10 others, the interior ministry said in a Telegram chat. At least six doctors were hurt.

Video was also alleged to show tanks crossing the Belarus-Ukraine border Thursday.

Earlier in the day, explosions could be heard before dawn in eastern Ukraine, with video appearing to capture explosions near Dnipro, less than 300 miles southeast of Kyiv.

‚ÄúNo, this is not a Russian invasion only in the east of Ukraine, but a full-scale attack from multiple directions,‚Äù Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a tweet Thursday.",https://www.yahoo.com/now/videos-hint-russias-military-might-172508582.html
