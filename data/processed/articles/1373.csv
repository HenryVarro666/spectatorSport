The State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine (SNRIU) told the IAEA that both its communications with the facility – the Kyiv branch of the State Specialized Enterprise ""Radon"" – and the radiation monitoring system at the site had been restored during the morning. SNRIU said it expects to soon receive the results of on-site radioactive monitoring. Staff at the facility were forced to take shelter during the night but could later assess the situation.

The incident came a day after SNRIU said an electrical transformer at a similar disposal facility near the north-eastern city of Kharkiv had been damaged, also without any reports of a radioactive release. Such facilities typically hold disused radioactive sources and other low-level waste from hospitals and industry.

“These two incidents highlight the very real risk that facilities with radioactive material will suffer damage during the conflict, with potentially severe consequences for human health and the environment,” Director General Grossi said.

“Once again, I urgently and strongly appeal to all parties to refrain from any military or other action that could threaten the safety and security of these facilities,” he added.

While these disposal sites do not contain high-level radioactive waste, the stored and disposed radioactive waste can still cause a serious radiological impact event, underlining the necessity to protect them, the Director General said. He praised the SNRIU and staff at the affected facilities for their vigilance and courage in ensuring continued safety and security.

1,e34caff1-ffae-4995-a0ec-19feea4af595,[],,"Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today that the country’s nuclear power plants were continuing to be operated safely and securely, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said, adding that he remained gravely concerned about maintaining their safety and security during the current conflict.

Ukraine’s nuclear power programme – 15 reactors at four sites – usually accounts for roughly half its electricity production.

On 27 February, Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry informed the IAEA that Russian military forces were advancing close to the largest of the sites – the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) in eastern Ukraine. Additional information received on 28 February from the operator confirmed that the Russian forces were operational near the site but had not entered it at the time of reporting. In this context, Director General Grossi stressed that any military or other action that could threaten the plant’s safety or security must be avoided.

The State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine (SNRIU) told the IAEA that it was continuing to gather information and in this morning’s update to the IAEA, the SNRIU said there had been no change in the “physical protection regime” of the Zaporizhzhya NPP and that its six units were in safe condition.

Director General Grossi said: “I continue to follow developments in Ukraine very closely and with grave concern, especially the conflict’s potential impact on the safety and security of the country’s nuclear facilities. It is extremely important that the nuclear power plants are not put at risk in any way.” He added: “An accident involving the nuclear facilities in Ukraine could have severe consequences for public health and the environment.”

Underlining such risks, the SNRIU informed the IAEA on Sunday that missiles had hit the site of a radioactive waste disposal facility in the capital Kyiv, but there was no damage to the building and no reports of a radioactive release.

Director General Grossi said it was of critical importance to maintain the capabilities of operational teams to ensure safety. In addition, vital supply chains should remain available to ensure that necessary services, equipment and components can be delivered to Ukraine’s nuclear facilities at all times, for example to carry out any emergency repairs.

Ukraine last week informed the IAEA that Russian forces had taken control of the facilities of the State Specialized Enterprise Chornobyl NPP, located within the Exclusion Zone set up after the 1986 accident. The regulator said today that the shift supervisor at the site had not been replaced since 24 February but that he continued to perform his duties. SNRIU also provided radiation readings from the site which the IAEA assessed as low and in line with near background levels.

Director General Grossi stressed again that staff at all nuclear facilities must be able to work and rest. He reiterated his call upon those in effective control of such sites not to take any actions that could compromise their safety or put them under undue pressure.

The IAEA continues to closely monitor developments in Ukraine, with a special focus on the safety and security of its nuclear power reactors.

2,e34caff1-ffae-4995-a0ec-19feea4af595,[],,"Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today that all of the country’s nuclear power plants remained under the control of the national operator and there were no new reports of potential threats to the sites, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said, reiterating his continued grave concern about the conflict and its potential consequences.

In its latest regular update to the IAEA, the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine (SNRIU) said it was communicating regularly with the plants and they were continuing to operate safely and securely. Their physical protection systems were in regular mode and the radiation levels at the sites were also normal, it added.

Earlier this week, Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry informed the IAEA that Russian military forces were advancing close to the largest of the sites – the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) in eastern Ukraine. As the Agency reported on 28 February, additional information received on that day from the operator confirmed that the Russian forces were near the site but had not entered it.

Director General Grossi has repeatedly stressed that any military or other action that could threaten the safety or security of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants – 15 reactors at four sites – must be avoided.

“I remain gravely concerned about the situation in Ukraine, especially regarding the safety and security of its nuclear power plants,” he said. “I renew my strong appeal to avoid any potential danger or threat to these facilities as any accident could have very severe consequences.”

“I also want to express my deep admiration and sincere gratitude for the tireless work, vigilance and bravery of the personnel operating the nuclear power plants, other nuclear facilities, and the staff of the regulator. We can all be very thankful for their determined and courageous efforts to ensure continued nuclear safety and security,” he added.

SNRIU said that all radioactive waste disposal facilities of the State Specialized Enterprise Radon were operating as usual, and the radiation monitoring systems did not indicate any deviations from normal values. On 27 February, the SNRIU informed the IAEA that missiles had hit the site of such a facility in the capital Kyiv, but there was no damage to the building and no reports of a radioactive release.

Ukraine last week informed the IAEA that Russian forces had taken control of the facilities of the State Specialized Enterprise Chornobyl NPP, located within the Exclusion Zone set up after the 1986 accident. The regulator said today that radiation levels around the facility were being monitored and did not exceed usual levels. Available plant personnel have not changed since last week and they are operating in shifts, it added.

“These two incidents highlight the very real risk that facilities with radioactive material will suffer damage during the conflict, with potentially severe consequences for human health and the environment,” IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said.

“I urgently and strongly appeal to all parties to refrain from any military or other action that could threaten the safety and security of these facilities.”

The IAEA’s board of governors will hold an extraordinary meeting on Wednesday in Vienna to discuss the current situation in Ukraine, an agency spokesperson said late Sunday in a text message.

Ukraine is Europe’s second-biggest generator of nuclear power after France. Energoatom, the utility which runs its reactors, has continued to operate its four plants housing 15 reactors even as Russia’s military incursion unfolded. Atomic energy generates about half the country’s power.

Russia also seized the area around the shuttered Chernobyl nuclear power plant during its advance into Ukraine.

IAEA calling on ""all parties"" to ensure nuclear safety

Ukraine says missiles hit radioactive waste site in Kyiv

VIENNA, Feb 27 (Reuters) - The U.N. nuclear watchdog's 35-nation Board of Governors will hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday about Ukraine, where war is raging in a country with four operational nuclear power plants and various waste facilitiesincluding Chernobyl.

Board members Canada and Poland called the meeting at the request of Ukraine, which is not on the Board, diplomats said. International Atomic Energy Agency member states that are not on the Board, like Ukraine, can call a Board meeting but the possible range of topics is wider if a Board member calls one.

""The IAEA Board of Governors will hold a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the current situation in Ukraine,"" the IAEA said in a statement, confirming a report by Reuters.

The agenda item for the 11 a.m. (1000 GMT) meeting is: ""The safety, security and safeguards implications of the situation in Ukraine,"" a diplomat said.

Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine began last week, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi has expressed concern and ""called on all parties to refrain from any measures or actions that could jeopardize the security of nuclear material, and the safe operation of all nuclear facilities"".

Russian forces have seized the spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste facilities at Chernobyl, the site of the world's worst nuclear accident at a now-defunct power plant. Staff on duty there have not been changed since Thursday, the IAEA said on Saturday, citing Ukraine's nuclear regulator.

Staff at Chernobyl must be able to work and rest as normal, the IAEA said on Saturday, meaning they must be rotated out to ensure the site's safety.

Diplomats say Ukrainian authorities have also informed the IAEA that Russian missiles hit a radioactive waste disposal site in Kyiv overnight but there was no visible damage and the results of on-site radioactive monitoring were pending.

Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on 27 February that missiles hit the site of a radioactive waste disposal facility in Kiev overnight but there were no reports of damage to the building or any indications of a radioactive release, director general Rafael Mariano Grossi said.

The State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine (SNRIU) told IAEA that both its communications with the facility – the Kiev branch of the State Specialised Enterprise Radon – and the radiation monitoring system at the site had been restored during the morning. SNRIU said it expects to soon receive the results of on-site radioactive monitoring. Staff at the facility were forced to take shelter during the night but could later assess the situation.

The incident came a day after SNRIU said an electrical transformer at a similar disposal facility near the north-eastern city of Kharkiv had been damaged, also without any reports of a radioactive release. Such facilities typically hold disused radioactive sources and other low-level waste from hospitals and industry.

“These two incidents highlight the very real risk that facilities with radioactive material will suffer damage during the conflict, with potentially severe consequences for human health and the environment,” Grossi said.

“Once again, I urgently and strongly appeal to all parties to refrain from any military or other action that could threaten the safety and security of these facilities,” he added. While these disposal sites do not contain high-level radioactive waste, the stored and disposed radioactive waste can still cause a serious radiological impact event, underlining the necessity to protect them, he noted. He praised the SNRIU and staff at the affected facilities for their vigilance and courage in ensuring continued safety and security.

IAEA continues to monitor developments, including at Chernobyl

The IAEA said it continues to closely monitor developments in Ukraine, with a special focus on the safety and security of its nuclear power reactors. On 26 February, Grossi said Ukraine had informed IAEA that its nuclear power plants remained stable and in normal operation. SNRIU said its staff maintained regular contacts with the plants. Ukraine has four nuclear power sites with a total of 15 reactors, providing roughly half of its electricity.

Earlier, on 24 February, Ukraine told the IAEA that “unidentified armed forces”. Later identified as Russian, had taken control of the facilities of the State Specialised Enterprise Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, located within the Exclusion Zone. Grossi said it was of vital importance that the safe and secure operations of the zone’s nuclear facilities should not be affected or disrupted in any way. Regarding reports earlier of higher radiation measurements at the Chernobyl site, SNRIU said they may have been caused by heavy military vehicles stirring up soil still contaminated from the 1986 accident.

The IAEA assessed that the readings reported by the regulator – of up to 9.46 microSieverts per hour – were low and within the operational range measured in the Exclusion Zone since it was established, and did not pose any danger to the public.

Reactors continue to operate safely

Meanwhile, Ukrainian nuclear utility Energoatom confirmed today, 28 February, that the nuclear power plants at Zaporozhye, Rovno, Khmelnitsky and South-Ukraine were operating safety.

It added that nine of the 15 reactors are operating. Rovno 1, Khmelnitsky 2 and Zaporozhye 1 are undergoing scheduled repairs, while Zaporozhe 5&6 have been placed in cold standby. South Ukraine 3 was “in reserve with further withdrawal to medium scheduled repairs. Energoatom’s total operating capacity was 7159MWe as of 9:00am on 28 February.

“There are no violations of the conditions of safe operation. Radiation, fire and environmental conditions at all NPPs and adjacent territories have not changed and are within current standards,” Energoatom said.

International nuclear industry response

The conflict in Ukraine is already affecting Russia’s nuclear industry. Finland’s Fennovoima said on 24 February that the future of the Hanhikivi nuclear power plant was at risk.

“The international situation has deteriorated in recent hours and is deteriorating all the time, and a major armed conflict in Europe is now a reality. Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the consequent retaliation by the EU and the West pose a major risk to the Hanhikivi 1 project.” It added: ""Fennovoima acknowledges that the ongoing conflict situation may have impacts on the Hanhikivi 1 project. In case there are impacts, we aim to mitigate those as much as possible.""

In an update on 28 February Fennovima said that the current decided sanctions are expected to impact the Hanhikivi 1 project. However, as details are not yet available, detailed impacts cannot be assessed for the time being.

""Fennovoima’s duties and legal obligations remain unchanged until there are changes to this framework through sanctions or binding decisions by the relevant authorities,"" it said. ""For the time being, we continue executing our project and carefully follow the developments of the situation.""

In January, licensing work for the Hanhikivi 1 nuclear power plant was said to have reached the 'homestretch' with Fennovoima expecting to submit its final licensing materials to Finland's Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority by the end of February, with the goal of gaining a construction licence this year.

Elsewhere, Sweden’s power company Vattenfall said on 24 February that it was ""deeply concerned by the serious security situation in Europe and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine” It added: “We have therefore decided that no planned deliveries from Russia to our nuclear power plants will take place until further notice. We will also not place any new orders from Russia to our nuclear power plants until further notice.”

Vattenfall added: “Our procurement strategy is based on having multiple suppliers from different countries, in order to safeguard our independence and security of supply to our nuclear power plants. Based on this we also have plans to manage possible irregularities in the supply. The operation of our nuclear power plants will therefore not be affected by these decisions.”",https://www.neimagazine.com/news/newsiaea-monitors-nuclear-facilities-in-ukraine-9513669
