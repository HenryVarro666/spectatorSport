Details: Information about casualties is being confirmed.

Haidai noted that the Russian army deliberately targets civilians who do not even have an opportunity to leave safely.

He gave a reminder that a few days ago, Russian troops had shelled buses carrying refugees in Rubizhne, and on 16 March they shelled a bus with Mariupol evacuees.

Details: Haidai also reported Russian shelling of Severodonetsk, Popasna, Lysychansk, and Kreminna.

The flag of the (LPR) is flying here now. This means for the local residents that, if the war has not ended yet, then it is in its final stages"", CNN reported.

Furthermore, in another video, the soldier can be seen standing in the Rubizhne mayor's office and hoisting an LPR flag on the government building. It is worth noting that alongside Donetsk, Luhansk is one of two rebel territories supported by the Vladimir Putin-led government. Parts of both areas are controlled by Ukraine, while others are governed by pro-Moscow rebels.

Heavy shelling continuing in Rubizhne: Luhansk regional administrator

Meanwhile, the regional administrator of Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai, asserted during an interview with local media that heavy shelling is continuing in Rubizhne. ""The enemy is simply destroying all the cities,"" Haidai stated in a video uploaded to his Telegram channel late Thursday. He added that the attacks were no longer selective. ""Earlier they were shelling more or less selectively, today they are firing deliberately, quadrant after quadrant,"" the regional administrator was quoted by CNN as saying.

""With continual fire, providing assistance to the people in need is tough,"" Haidai said but stressed that an attempt would be made later this week with the cooperation of Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to build an evacuation route to send supplies to significant cities, CNN reported.

According to Haidai, the Russian military demolished a boarding school for visually challenged children, as well as a hospital, and other military buildings in Rubizhne on Tuesday. He said that four individuals has lost their lives during the military strike. Haidai went on to say that for the past two weeks, people have been living in basements. Some of the buildings have bomb bunkers. According to him, some bomb shelters can hold up to 1,200 people.

Meanwhile, amid the Russia-Ukraine war, Moscow has declared a no-fly zone above Ukraine's Donbass area, according to a rebel spokesperson from the Russian-backed separatists Donetsk People's Republic, Interfax News Agency reported on Friday. The no-fly zone in Russia's south has been prolonged until March 26, according to a separate report by TASS.

Two children were killed in the town of Rubizhne after being pulled from the rubble of a residential building pummeled by Russian artillery fire, the emergency services said.

A woman also died in the same building collapse; her daughter survived and was in a stable condition.

Some context: Rubizhne is part of a cluster of small towns and villages that remain in Ukrainian hands but lie close to two breakaway pro-Russian statelets inside eastern Ukraine.

The Ukrainian army’s most recent assessment of the war makes clear they are seen as a current focus of Russia’s campaign in the east — to link the two strongholds around Luhansk and Donetsk with territorial gains made to the northwest in the region around Kharkiv.

Saturday’s daily update from the army’s central command — released in the early afternoon — reported a series of Russian offensives with “the main efforts focused on attempts to capture Severodonetsk, Rubizhne and Popasna.”

Further deaths and destruction: On Friday, four people were killed and ten others injured as Russian artillery opened up across a series of communities in the region, local Ukrainian authorities said.

Regional head Serhii Haidai said a total of 54 buildings had been hit, including 19 apartment blocks and two health care centers.

Some 23 towns and villages were without gas supplies and 26 were without electricity by the day’s end.

Luhansk is one of two separatist regions backed by Russia, along with Donetsk. Both regions are split between parts controlled by Ukraine and by pro-Moscow separatists.

In videos posted Thursday to the official channel of the People’s Militia of the Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR), a uniformed soldier says, “We are located next to the administration of the city Rubizhne. The flag of the (LPR) is flying here now. This means for the local residents that, if the war hasn’t ended yet, then it’s in its final stages.”

In another video, the soldier is seen standing in the Rubizhne mayor’s office and is later seen placing a flag of the LPR on the roof of the government building. After an explosion is heard, he says: “That’s more shelling, from the Ukrainian side.”

Ongoing attacks: Shelling continues in Rubizhne, Luhansk regional administrator Serhiy Haidai said in a clip from an interview with local media.

In the clip posted to his Telegram channel late Thursday, Haidai said, “The enemy is simply destroying all the cities.”

“It’s not even selective anymore. Earlier they were shelling more or less selectively, today they are firing deliberately, quadrant after quadrant,” he added.

“People have been in basements for two weeks. Some have bomb shelters. If there’s a factory nearby, there are good, strong bomb shelters there.”

Up to 1,200 people are in some bomb shelters, he said.

Delivering aid is difficult with constant firing, he said, but added that with the help of Ukraine’s presidential office, there will be an attempt to create an evacuation corridor later in the week to deliver supplies to large cities.

Accounts of destruction: On Tuesday, Haidai said the Russian military destroyed a boarding school for visually impaired children in Rubizhne, in addition to a hospital, three other schools and “other military facilities.”

Four people were killed during the military strike, he said.

The Russian offensive against Ukraine remains largely static as of late March 19, with mobile ground operations appearing to be concentrated in the south of the country as well as the Donbas region. Heavy fighting has been reported around the cities of Mariupol and Severodonetsk in recent days as the Kremlin seeks to achieve its military aim of seizing control of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, in addition to establishing a land bridge between Russia and Crimea. Nevertheless, a one-day humanitarian corridor and localized ceasefire were reportedly observed in the Luhansk Region starting at 09:00 March 19, enabling the evacuation of refugees from the towns of Severodonetsk, Rubizhne, Popasna, and Lysychansk.

Russian air, missile, and artillery strikes against targets elsewhere in Ukraine also continue as of March 19. Daily shelling has been reported in several cities, including the capital, Kyiv, as well as Chernihiv, Kharkiv, and Sumy. In recent days, shelling and aerial bombardments have also occurred in Vinnytsia, Izyum, Kremenchuk, Bila Tserkva, Nikopol, Mykolaiv, Kyiv, Izmail, Odesa, Poltava, and Zaporizhzhia. Russian missiles have also sporadically targeted military facilities in western Ukraine, including an aviation repair facility near Danylo Halytskyi International Airport (LWO) in the Lviv Region along with a missile and aircraft munitions depot near the village of Deliatyn in the Ivano-Frankivsk Region.

Though Russian advances have slowed or halted, ground assaults continue to take place in several locations, albeit at a lower intensity than in the initial phase of the conflict. Russian forces have clashed with Ukrainian troops on the outskirts of Kyiv, Kharkiv, Sumy, and Chernihiv without making significant advances. Inconclusive clashes have also reportedly taken place on the outskirts of Izyum, in Kharkiv Region, as well as in areas surrounding the city. Mariupol continues to face ground assaults on its eastern and western outskirts amid heavy bombardment; Russia-backed forces have occupied several satellite towns around Mariupol.

Protests denouncing the Russian offensive and the subsequent occupation have taken place in multiple urban centers. Residents have held protests in locations throughout the Kherson Region in recent days; Russian forces reportedly fired into the air to disperse a gathering in Kherson March 14. Elsewhere, protests have been held in Berdyansk and Melitopol, which are also under Russian occupation. These actions highlight the difficulty Russian forces may encounter when attempting to impose order in some cities under their occupation.

Disruptions and Shortages

Ukrainian Railways (UZ) continues to operate evacuation trains from Kyiv and multiple other areas, including Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kryvyi Rih, Zakarpattia, Zaporizhzhia, and Odesa. Clashes and artillery strikes periodically prompt the suspension of evacuations. Large crowds continue to be reported at stations offering evacuation services. Intercity and regional rail services are available intermittently; rail services are subject to disruptions without warning. Civilian aviation is suspended and the nation's seaports are closed.

Nightly curfews are in effect in multiple regions during various time frames. In the Kyiv Region, a curfew is in place 20:00-06:00 on March 19 and 20; in Mikolaiv, a nightly 20:00-06:00 curfew will enter into force on March 20. In Zaporizhzhia, authorities have imposed a curfew from 16:00 March 19 through 06:00 March 21; the city's railway station will suspend operations during this time frame. Generally, civilians must stay indoors during curfew hours; exemptions are in place for workers in critical infrastructure, and persons seeking urgent medical care or bomb shelters. Depending on the ground situation, authorities may extend or amend curfew hours on short notice.

Intermittent telecommunications, internet, and utility disruptions continue across much of the country. Reports also indicate a shortage of basic supplies, including groceries and pharmaceutical products, in multiple cities facing Russian ground assaults. The most severe shortages and disruptions are consistently reported in Chernihiv, Kharkiv, and Mariupol, which have suffered heavy bombardments and repeated ground assaults in recent days. Similar situations are likely in other cities facing Russian ground offensives or heavy bombardments. Finally, the National Bank of Ukraine has limited foreign currency transfers and withdrawals.

Ukraine's borders with Belarus, Russia, and the Transnistria region of Moldova are closed to foreign nationals; only Ukrainian citizens can enter from these areas. Ukraine's borders with Hungary, Moldova, Poland, and Slovakia remain open. Though congestion has eased since the early days of the conflict, delays may worsen depending on conflict developments elsewhere in the country.

Context

Negotiations between Russian and Ukrainian officials are ongoing. Although recent talks have failed to yield any concrete de-escalation of the conflict, officials from both sides have intimated that progress is being made. Both Russian and Ukrainian positions are believed to have softened with Moscow no longer demanding Ukraine's unconditional surrender, while Kyiv has indicated a willingness to abandon the pursuit of NATO membership in exchange for security guarantees. However, the official negotiating positions of each country are still far apart. Ukraine has demanded a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian forces, while Russia has demanded that Ukraine surrender, disarm, and declare itself to be a neutral country remaining outside NATO and the EU.

The Verkhovna Rada (parliament) has voted to extend martial law through April 25. Martial law gives the government emergency powers to carry out extraordinary measures for the defense of the country. Public gatherings are prohibited and authorities may use private property for the needs of defense.

Advice

Avoid travel to Ukraine until the situation stabilizes; consider exiting the country if safe to do so. Where fighting or airstrikes are occurring, shelter in place until the situation becomes clear. If officials report incoming fire, stay away from windows and exterior walls. Strictly heed the instructions of local security personnel, particularly when ordered to air-raid shelters. Stockpile food, fuel, and water when possible and safe to do so. Maintain contact with your diplomatic representation. Confirm that a thorough communication plan exists to ensure rapid accountability for all personnel operating in Ukraine. Reconfirm the status of public transport services, road routes, and borders before departure.
