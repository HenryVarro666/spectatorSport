0,466130ba-0e19-4ee9-aed4-a4ede10fc6f5,[],2022-02-24 00:00:00,"Russia to Face Massive Costs from its Isolation from the Global Financial and Trade System and Cutting-Edge Technology

Today, the United States, along with Allies and partners, is imposing severe and immediate economic costs on Russia in response to Putin’s war of choice against Ukraine. Today’s actions include sweeping financial sanctions and stringent export controls that will have profound impact on Russia’s economy, financial system, and access to cutting-edge technology. The sanctions measures impose severe costs on Russia’s largest financial institutions and will further isolate Russia from the global financial system. With today’s financial sanctions, we have now targeted all ten of Russia’s largest financial institutions, including the imposition of full blocking and correspondent and payable-through account sanctions, and debt and equity restrictions, on institutions holding nearly 80% of Russian banking sector assets. The unprecedented export control measures will cut off more than half of Russia’s high-tech imports, restricting Russia’s access to vital technological inputs, atrophying its industrial base, and undercutting Russia’s strategic ambitions to exert influence on the world stage. The impact of these measures will be significantly magnified due to historical multilateral cooperation with a wide range of Allies and partners who are mirroring our actions, inhibiting Putin’s ambition to diversify Russia’s brittle, one-dimensional economy. The scale of Putin’s aggression and the threat it poses to the international order require a resolute response, and we will continue imposing severe costs if he does not change course.

Putin’s threatening actions and now his unprovoked aggression toward Ukraine are being met with an unprecedented level of multilateral cooperation. The United States welcomes the commitments by Australia, Canada, the European Union, Japan, and the United Kingdom that they will also take similarly forceful actions to hold Russia accountable – demonstrating the strength of our partnerships and deepening the impact on Russia more than any action we could have taken alone. This follows our joint action earlier this week to impose a first tranche of severe sanctions on Russia.

As a result of Putin’s war of choice, Russia will face immediate and intense pressure on its economy, and massive costs from its isolation from the global financial system, global trade, and cutting-edge technology. This includes cutting off Russia’s largest bank from the U.S. financial system – a significant blow to its ability to function and process global trade. It also includes full blocking sanctions on Russia’s second largest bank – freezing any of its assets touching the U.S. financial system. Russia’s ability to access global markets, attract investment, and utilize the U.S. dollar will be devastated.

Russia’s economy has already faced intensified pressure in recent weeks; just today its stock market sunk to its lowest level in four and a half years, and the ruble weakened beyond its weakest daily settlement price on record – before additional sanctions were even imposed. With these new stringent measures, these pressures will further accumulate and suppress Russia’s economic growth, increase its borrowing costs, raise inflation, intensify capital outflows, and erode its industrial base. The United States and our Allies and partners are unified and will continue to impose costs, forcing Putin to look to other countries that cannot replicate the financial and technology strengths of Western markets.

Today, the United States carried out the following actions:

Severing the connection to the U.S. financial system for Russia’s largest financial institution, Sberbank , including 25 subsidiaries, by imposing correspondent and payable-through account sanctions. This action will restrict Sberbank’s access to transactions made in the dollar. Sberbank is the largest bank in Russia, holds nearly one-third of the overall Russian banking sector’s assets, is heavily connected to the global financial system, and is systemically critical to the Russian financial system.

Sberbank is the largest bank in Russia, holds nearly one-third of the overall Russian banking sector’s assets, is heavily connected to the global financial system, and is systemically critical to the Russian financial system. Full blocking sanctions on Russia’s second largest financial institution, VTB Bank (VTB) , including 20 subsidiaries. This action will freeze any of VTB’s assets touching the U.S financial system and prohibit U.S. persons from dealing with them. VTB holds nearly one-fifth of the overall Russian banking sector’s assets, is heavily exposed to the U.S. and western financial systems, and is systemically critical to the Russian financial system.

These sanctions freeze any of these institutions’ assets touching the U.S financial system and prohibit U.S. persons from dealing with them.

These sanctions freeze any of these institutions’ assets touching the U.S financial system and prohibit U.S. persons from dealing with them. These financial institutions play a significant a role in the Russian economy. New debt and equity restrictions on thirteen of the most critical major Russian enterprises and entities. This includes restrictions on all transactions in, provision of financing for, and other dealings in new debt of greater than 14 days maturity and new equity issued by thirteen Russian state-owned enterprises and entities: Sberbank, AlfaBank, Credit Bank of Moscow, Gazprombank, Russian Agricultural Bank, Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Transneft, Rostelecom, RusHydro, Alrosa, Sovcomflot, and Russian Railways. These entities, including companies critical to the Russian economy with estimated assets of nearly $1.4 trillion, will not be able to raise money through the U.S. market — a key source of capital and revenue generation, which limits the Kremlin’s ability to raise money for its activity.

Additional full blocking sanctions on Russian elites and their family members: Sergei Ivanov (and his son, Sergei), Nikolai Patrushev (and his son Andrey ), Igor Sechin (and his son Ivan), Andrey Puchkov, Yuriy Solviev (and two real estate companies he owns), Galina Ulyutina, and Alexander Vedyakhin. This action includes individuals who have enriched themselves at the expense of the Russian state, and have elevated their family members into some of the highest position of powers in the country. It also includes financial figures who sit atop Russia’s largest financial institutions and are responsible for providing the resources necessary to support Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. This action follows up on yesterday’s action targeting Russian elites and their family members and cuts them off from the U.S. financial system, freezes any assets they hold in the United States and blocks their travel to the United States.

Costs on Belarus for supporting a further invasion of Ukraine by sanctioning 24 Belarusian individuals and entities, including targeting Belarus’ military and financial capabilities by sanctioning two significant Belarusian state-owned banks, nine defense firms, and seven regime-connected official and elites. We call on Belarus to withdraw its support for Russian aggression in Ukraine.

This includes measures against military end users, including the Russian Ministry of Defense . Exports of nearly all U.S. items and items produced in foreign countries using certain U.S.-origin software, technology, or equipment will be restricted to targeted military end users. These comprehensive restrictions apply to the Russian Ministry of Defense, including the Armed Forces of Russia, wherever located.

Russia-wide restrictions to choke off Russia’s import of technological goods critical to a diversified economy and Putin’s ability to project power. This includes Russia-wide denial of exports of sensitive technology, primarily targeting the Russian defense, aviation, and maritime sectors to cut off Russia’s access to cutting-edge technology . In addition to sweeping restrictions on the Russian-defense sector, the United States government will impose Russia-wide restrictions on sensitive U.S. technologies produced in foreign countries using U.S.-origin software, technology, or equipment. This includes Russia-wide restrictions on semiconductors, telecommunication, encryption security, lasers, sensors, navigation, avionics and maritime technologies. These severe and sustained controls will cut off Russia’s access to cutting edge technology.

Historical multilateral cooperation that serves as a force multiplier in restricting more than $50 billion in key inputs to Russia- impacting far more than that in Russia’s production. As a result of this multilateral coordination, we will provide an exemption for other countries that adopt equally stringent measures. Countries that adopt substantially similar export restrictions are exempted from new U.S. licensing requirements for items produced in their countries. The European Union, Australia, Japan, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, have already communicated their plans for parallel actions. This unprecedented coordination significantly expands the scope of restrictions on Russia. Further engagement with Allies and partners will continue to maximize the impact on Russia’s military capabilities.

1:43 P.M. EST

THE PRESIDENT: Sorry to keep you waiting. Good afternoon. The Russian military has begun a brutal assault on the people of Ukraine without provocation, without justification, without necessity.

This is a premeditated attack. Vladimir Putin has been planning this for months, as I’ve been — as we’ve been saying all along. He moved more than 175,000 troops, military equipment into positions along the Ukrainian border.

He moved blood supplies into position and built a field hospital, which tells you all you need to know about his intentions all along.

He rejected every good-faith effort the United States and our Allies and partners made to address our mutual security concerns through dialogue to avoid needless conflict and avert human suffering.

For weeks — for weeks, we have been warning that this would happen. And now it’s unfolding largely as we predicted.

In the past week, we’ve seen shelling increase in the Donbas, the region in eastern Ukraine controlled by Russian-backed separatists.

Rus- — the Russian government has perpetrated cyberattacks against Ukraine.

We saw a staged political theater in Moscow — outlandish and baseless claims that Ukraine was — Ukraine was about to invade and launch a war against Russia, that Ukraine was prepared to use chemical weapons, that Ukraine committed a genocide — without any evidence.

We saw a flagrant violation of international law in attempting to unilaterally create two new so-called republics on sovereign Ukrainian territory.

And at the very moment that the United Nations Security Council was meeting to stand up for Ukraine’s sovereignty to stave off invasion, Putin declared his war.

Within moments — moments, missile strikes began to fall on historic cities across Ukraine.

Then came in the air raids, followed by tanks and troops rolling in.

We’ve been transparent with the world. We’ve shared declassified evidence about Russia’s plans and cyberattacks and false pretexts so that there can be no confusion or cover-up about what Putin was doing.

Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences.

Today, I’m authorizing additional strong sanctions and new limitations on what can be exported to Russia.

This is going to impose severe costs on the Russian economy, both immediately and over time.

We have purposefully designed these sanctions to maximize the long-term impact on Russia and to minimize the impact on the United States and our Allies.

And I want to be clear: The United States is not doing this alone. For months, we’ve been building a coalition of partners representing well more than half of the global economy.

Twenty-seven members of the European Union, including France, Germany, Italy — as well as the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and many others — to amplify the joint impact of our response.

I just spoke with the G7 leaders this morning, and we are in full and total agreement. We will limit Russia’s ability to do business in Dollars, Euros, Pounds, and Yen to be part of the global economy. We will limit their ability to do that. We are going to stunt the ability to finance and grow Rus- — the Russian military.

We’re going to impose major — and we’re going to impair their ability to compete in a high-tech 21st century economy.

We’ve already seen the impact of our actions on Russia’s currency, the Ruble, which early today hit its weakest level ever — ever in history. And the Russian stock market plunged today. The Russian government’s borrowing rate spiked by over 15 percent.

In today’s actions, we have now sanctioned Russian banks that together hold around $1 trillion in assets.

We’ve cut off Russia’s largest bank — a bank that holds more than one third of Russia’s banking assets by itself — cut it off from the U.S. financial system.

And today, we’re also blocking four more major banks. That means every asset they have in America will be frozen. This includes V.T.B., the second-largest bank in Russia, which has $250 billion in assets.

As promised, we’re also adding names to the list of Russian elites and their family members that are sanctioning — that we’re sanctioning as well.

As I said on Tuesday, these are people who personally gain from the Kremlin’s policies and they should share in the pain. We will keep up this drumbeat of those designations against corrupt billionaires in the days ahead.

On Tuesday, we stopped the Russian government from raising money from U.S. or European investors.

Now, we’re going to apply the same restrictions to Russia’s largest state-owned enterprises — companies with assets that exceed $1.4 trillion.

Some of the most powerful impacts of our actions will come over time as we squeeze Russia’s access to finance and technology for strategic sectors of its economy and degrade its industrial capacity for years to come.

Between our actions and those of our Allies and partners, we estimate that we’ll cut off more than half of Russia’s high-tech imports.

It will strike a blow to their ability to continue to modernize their military. It’ll degrade their aerospace industry, including their space program. It will hurt their ability to build ships, reducing their ability to compete economically. And it will be a major hit to Putin’s long-term strategic ambitions.

And we’re preparing to do more. In addition to the economic penalties we’re imposing, we’re also taking steps to defend our NATO Allies, particularly in the east.

Tomorrow, NATO will convene a summit — we’ll be there — to bring together the leaders of 30 Allied nations and close partners to affirm our solidarity and to map out the next steps we will take to further strengthen all aspects of our NATO Alliance.

Although we provided over $650 million in defensive assistance to Ukraine just this year — this last year, let me say it again: Our forces are not and will not be engaged in the conflict with Russia in Ukraine. Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine but to defend our NATO Allies and reassure those Allies in the east.

As I made crystal clear, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power. And the good news is: NATO is more united and more determined than ever.

There is no doubt — no doubt that the United States and every NATO Ally will meet our Article 5 commitments, which says that an attack on one is an attack on all.

Over the past few weeks, I ordered thousands of additional forces to Germany and Poland as part of our commitment to NATO.

On Tuesday, in response to Russia’s aggressive action, including its troop presence in Belarus and the Black Sea, I’ve authorized the deployment of ground and air forces already stationed in Europe to NATO’s eastern flank Allies: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Romania.

Our Allies have also been stepping up, adding — the other Allies, the rest of NATO — adding their own forces and capabilities to ensure our collective defense.

And today, within hours of Russia’s unleashing its assault, NATO came together and authorized and activated — an activation of response plans.

This will enable NATO’s high-readiness forces to deploy and — when and where they’re needed to protect our NATO Allies on the eastern boundaries of Europe.

And now I’m authorizing additional U.S. forces and capabilities to deploy to Germany as part of NATO’s response, including some of U.S.-based forces that the Department of Defense placed on standby weeks ago.

I’ve also spoken with Defense Secretary Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Milley, about preparations for additional moves should they become necessary to protect our NATO Allies and support the greatest military Alliance in the history of the world — NATO.

As we respond, my administration is using the tools — every tool at our disposal to protect American families and businesses from rising prices at the gas pump.

You know, we’re taking active steps to bring down the costs. And American oil and gas companies should not — should not exploit this moment to hike their prices to raise profits.

You know, in our sanctions package, we specifically designed to allow energy payments to continue.

We are closely monitoring energy supplies for any disruption. We have been coordinating with major oil producing and consuming countries toward our common interest to secure global energy supplies.

We are actively working with countries around the world to elevate [evaluate] a collective release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserves of major energy-consuming countries. And the United States will release additional barrels of oil as conditions warrant.

I know this is hard and that Americans are already hurting. I will do everything in my power to limit the pain the American people are feeling at the gas pump. This is critical to me.

But this aggression cannot go unanswered. If it did, the consequences for America would be much worse. America stands up to bullies. We stand up for freedom. This is who we are.

Let me also repeat the warning I made last week: If Russia pursues cyberattacks against our companies, our critical infrastructure, we are prepared to respond.

For months, we have been working closely with our private — with the private sector to harden their cyber defenses, sharpen our ability to respond to Russian cyberattacks as well.

I spoke late last night to President Zelenskyy of Ukraine and I assured him that the United States, together with our Allies and partners in Europe, will support the Ukrainian people as they defend their country. We’ll provide humanitarian relief to ease their suffering.

And in the early days of this conflict, Russian propaganda outlets will keep trying to hide the truth and claim success for its military operation against a made-up threat.

But history has shown time and again how swift gains in territory eventually give way to grinding occupations, acts of mass civil — mass civil disobedience, and strategic dead-ends.

The next few weeks and months will be hard on the people of Ukraine. Putin has unleashed a great pain on them. But the Ukrainian people have known 30 years of independence, and they have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.

This is a dangerous moment for all of Europe, for the freedom around the world. Putin has a — has committed an assault on the very principles that uphold global peace.

But now the entire world sees clearly what Putin and his Kremlin — and his Kremlin allies are really all about. This was never about genuine security concerns on their part. It was always about naked aggression, about Putin’s desire for empire by any means necessary — by bullying Russia’s neighbors through coercion and corruption, by changing borders by force, and, ultimately, by choosing a war without a cause.

Putin’s actions betray his sinister vision for the future of our world — one where nations take what they want by force.

But it is a vision that the United States and freedom-loving nations everywhere will oppose with every tool of our considerable power.

The United States and our Allies and partners will emerge from this stronger, more united, more determined, and more purposeful.

And Putin’s aggression against Ukraine will end up costing Russia dearly — economically and strategically. We will make sure of that. Putin will be a pariah on the international stage. Any nation that countenances Russia’s naked aggression against Ukraine will be stained by association.

When the history of this era is written, Putin’s choice to make a totally unjustifiable war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.

Liberty, democracy, human dignity — these are the forces far more powerful than fear and oppression. They cannot be extinguished by tyrants like Putin and his armies. They cannot be erased by people — from people’s hearts and hopes by any amount of violence and intimidation. They endure.

And in the contest between democracy and autocracy, between sovereignty and subjugation, make no mistake: Freedom will prevail.

God bless the people of a free and democratic Ukraine. And may God protect our troops.

Q President Biden —

THE PRESIDENT: Associated Press, Zeke.

Q Chris Megerian. So, do you have any plans to speak with President Putin at this point? And what interactions have you had with the Russian government?

THE PRESIDENT: I heard the first part: Do I have any plans to speak with Putin at this point. And what?

Q What communications have you had with the Kremlin as far as military (inaudible) in Ukraine and making sure this does not spiral into a larger conflict?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, it’s a large conflict already. The way we’re going to assure it’s not going to spiral to a larger conflict is by providing all the forces needed in the Eastern European nations that are members of NATO. NATO is more united than it’s ever been.

And I have no plans to talk with Putin.

Wall Street Journal, Tarina [Tarini].

Q Mr. President, you didn’t mention SWIFT in your sanctions that you announced. Is there a reason why the U.S. isn’t doing that? Is there disagreement among Allies regarding SWIFT and whether Russia should be allowed to be a part of it?

THE PRESIDENT: The sanctions that we have proposed on all their banks is of equal consequence — maybe more consequence than SWIFT — number one.

Number two, it is always an option. But right now, that’s not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take.

Cecilia Ve- — Vega, ABC.

Q Thank you, sir. Sir, sanctions clearly have not been enough to deter Vladimir Putin to this point. What is going to stop him? How and when does this end? And do you see him trying to go beyond Ukraine?

And a second question I’ll just give to you now: This statement that he gave last night will — that the We- — the threat that he gave — the West “will face consequences greater than any you have faced in history.” Is he threatening a nuclear strike?

THE PRESIDENT: I have no idea what he’s threatening. I know what he has done, number one.

And number two, no one expected the sanctions to prevent anything from happening. That has to sh- — this is going to take time. And we have to show resolve so he knows what’s coming and so the people of Russia know what he’s brought on them. That’s what this is all about.

This is going to take time. It’s not going to occur — he’s going to say, “Oh my God, these sanctions are coming. I’m going to stand down.”

He’s going to test the resolve of the West to see if we stay together. And we will. We will and it will impose significant costs on him.

Q Will he go beyond Ukraine, sir? Do you see him going beyond Ukraine?

Q Mr. President — Mr. President —

THE PRESIDENT: (Points to reporter.) Yes.

Q Thank you. Two topics, just really quick. First, markets are down and gas prices are up. I know you always stress the difference between Wall Street and Main Street, but everybody seems to be in for some economic pain. How economically painful is it going to get for people in this country?

And I do have one more question.

THE PRESIDENT: First of all, there’s no doubt that when a major nuclear power attacks and invades another country that the world is going to respond and markets are going to respond all over the world. So, there’s no doubt about that, number one.

Number two, the notion that this is going to last for a long time is highly unlikely, as long as we continue to stay resolved in imposing the sanctions we’re going to impose on Russia, period.

What’s your next question? I’m sorry.

Q The next question is: Did you underestimate Putin? And would you still describe him the way that you did in the summer, as a “worthy adversary”?

THE PRESIDENT: At the time, he was — I made it clear he was an adversary, and I said he was “worthy.” I didn’t underestimate him.

And I’ve read most of everything he’s written. Did you read the — I shouldn’t sa- — I’m not being a wise guy. The — you heard the speech he made — almost an hour’s worth of speeches — why he was going into Ukraine.

He has much larger ambitions in Ukraine. He wants to, in fact, reestablish the former Soviet Union. That’s what this is about.

And I think that his — his ambitions are — are completely contrary to the place where the rest of the world has arrived.

Q President Biden — President Biden —

Q And — and with that — with his ambitions, you’re confident that these devastating sanctions are going to be as devastating as Russian missiles and bullets and tanks?

THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Russian bullets, missiles, and tanks in Ukraine. Yes, I am.

Q Thank you, President Biden. If sanctions cannot stop President Putin, what penalty can?

THE PRESIDENT: I didn’t say sanctions couldn’t stop him.

Q But you’ve been talking about the threat of these sanctions for several weeks now —

THE PRESIDENT: Yes, but the threat of the sanctions and imposing the sanctions and seeing the effect of the sanctions are two different things.

Q Okay, but —

THE PRESIDENT: They’re two different things. And we’re now going to — he’s going to begin to see the effect of the sanctions.

Q And what will that do — how will that change his mindset here, given he’s attacking Ukraine as we speak?

THE PRESIDENT: Because it will so weaken his country that he’ll have to make a very, very difficult choices of whether to continue to move toward being a second-rate power or, in fact, respond.

Q You said, in recent weeks, that big nations cannot bluff when it comes to something like this. You recently said that the idea of personally sanctioning President Putin was on the table. Is that a step that you’re prepared to take? And if not —

THE PRESIDENT: It’s not a bluff; it’s on the table.

Q Sanctioning President Putin?

THE PRESIDENT: Yes.

Q Why not sanction him today, sir? Why not sanction him today, sir?

Q Mr. President —

Q Mr. President, if I can, you detailed some severe and swift new sanctions today and said the impact it will have over time, but given the full-scale invasion, given that you’re not pursuing disconnecting Russia from what’s called “SWIFT” — the international banking system — or other sanctions at your disposal, respectfully, sir, what more are you waiting for?

THE PRESIDENT: Specifically, the sanctions we’ve imposed exceed SWIFT. The sanctions we imposed exceed anything that’s ever been done. The sanctions we imposed have generated two thirds of the world joining us. They are profound sanctions. Let’s have a conversation in another month or so to see if they’re working.

Yes.

Q Let me ask you about — can I ask you about Zelenskyy? Sir, you spoke to Volodymyr Zelenskyy yesterday, sir, if I could follow up —

Q What’s the risk that we are watching the beginning of another Cold War? And is there now a complete rupture in U.S. and Russian relations?

THE PRESIDENT: There is a complete rupture right now in U.S.-Russian relations if they continue on this path that they’re on.

And in terms of a Cold War, that depends. You have the vast majority of the rest of the world in total opposition to what he’s doing — from Asia to South America to Europe to acr- — around the world.

And so, it’s going to be a cold day for Russia. The idea — you don’t see a whole lot of people coming to his defense.

Q And are you — are you — if I could follow-up, sir. Are you urging China to help isolate Russia? Are you urging China to help isolate Russia?

THE PRESIDENT: I’m not prepared to comment on that at the moment.

(Cross-talk by reporters.)

Q Mr. President —

THE PRESIDENT: Wait. No, no. (Points to reporter.) Yeah.

No, no, no. He’s had his hand up a long time.

Q Thank you, Mr. President. How concerned are you that Putin wants to go beyond Ukraine into other countries and the U.S. will have to get involved if he moves into NATO countries?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, if he did move into NATO countries, he will be involved — we will be involved. The only thing that I’m convinced of is: If we don’t stop now, he’ll be emboldened. If we don’t move against him now with these significant sanctions, he will be emboldened.

Look, you know, every — well, anyway.

Q And can you talk anything more about your conversation —

(Cross-talk by reporters.)

THE PRESIDENT: I’m sorry, I can’t hear you.

Q Sir, India, which is a major defense partner of the United States — is India with — fully with you on the issue of Ukraine and Russia?

THE PRESIDENT: Does the Defense Department of the United States —

Q Sir, India is one of your major defense partners. Is India fully in sync with United States on Russia?

THE PRESIDENT: We’re going to be — we’re in consultation with — with India today. We haven’t resolved that completely.

Q One more question —

(Cross-talk by reporters.)

THE PRESIDENT: Okay, thank you all very much. Thank you.

2:05 P.M. EST",https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/02/24/remarks-by-president-biden-on-russias-unprovoked-and-unjustified-attack-on-ukraine/
2,466130ba-0e19-4ee9-aed4-a4ede10fc6f5,['Julia Zorthian'],,"The United States is set to impose sanctions on Russia that “exceed anything we’ve ever done,” President Joe Biden said Thursday in response to Russia’s full-scale attack on Ukraine.

Biden detailed expansive sanctions on Russia’s financial institutions, major enterprises and individuals in Putin’s power hierarchy. The White House is also placing restrictions on Russian military and civilian purchases of U.S. goods and services, most notably high-tech imports. The actions build on an earlier round of sanctions Biden first announced Tuesday, after Putin ordered troops to two separatist regions within Ukraine.

“Putin’s aggression against Ukraine will end up costing Russia dearly, economically and strategically,” Biden said. “We will make sure of that.”

The White House made the sanctions decisions in consultation with the Group of Seven (G7) leadership and the National Security Council (NSC), following conversations with both groups on Thursday morning. Biden announced the economic response amid calls from both Democrat and Republican members of Congress to impose harsh sanctions on Russian president Vladimir Putin.

The Russian aggression has triggered multilateral cooperation from countries “representing more than half the global economy,” Biden added. The European Union, Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand and the United Kingdom have already agreed to impose similar sanctions, according to the White House.

“We will limit Russia’s ability to do business in dollars, euros, pounds and yen,” Biden said.

Putin’s desire to take over Ukraine is a vision that “the United States and freedom-loving nations everywhere will oppose with every tool of our considerable power,” Biden noted.

Here’s a breakdown of the U.S. sanctions announced Thursday:

Blocking Major Russian Banks From U.S. connections

The U.S. is cutting ties with Russia’s 10 largest financial institutions—effectively severing any flow of money between the U.S. market and institutions representing almost 80% of assets in the Russian banking sector.

The most notable restrictions fall on the country’s biggest bank, Sberbank, and 25 of its subsidiaries, all of which account for over one-third of Russia’s financial assets. Other major financial institutions that the U.S. will fully restrict include VTB Bank, Bank Otkritie, Sovcombank OJSC, and Novikombank. Any of their assets that even touch the U.S. financial system will be blocked, and the U.S. government and its citizens are prohibited from doing any business with them. “That means that every asset [these banks] have in America will be frozen,” Biden said at the briefing.

Biden stopped short of implementing a blockage of so-called SWIFT transfers from Russia, explaining that the “sanctions that we have proposed on all of [Russia’s] banks is of equal consequence—maybe more consequence—than SWIFT.” He added that excluding Russia from SWIFT is “always an option. But right now, that’s not the position the rest of Europe wishes to take.” European officials reportedly opposed the SWIFT option because it would mean Russian companies and individuals would lose access to their main means of repaying some $30 billion in debts they owe to European lenders.

Sanctions on Individuals in Putin’s Power Hierarchy

The White House has added more than 10 people and entities to the list of Russian elites (and their family members) that the U.S. has sanctioned over the Ukraine threat and invasion. That means any assets those individuals hold in the U.S. will freeze. These individuals will be cut off from the U.S. financial system, and they are prohibited from traveling to America.

“These are People who personally gained from the Kremlin’s policies, and they should share in the pain,” Biden said.

Officially, these civilian leaders are now on the “Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List” at the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control.

Restrictions on 13 Major Corporations and Other Entities

The sanctions also target 13 major Russian companies and other entities beyond the banking sector. That means the U.S. will apply new debt and equity restrictions on transactions involving the state-owned gas company Gazprom, the financial institution supporting Russia’s agricultural sector, and the Russian Railways train service.

These entities–representing Russia’s major industrial sectors–can no longer raise money through the U.S. market. The move is designed to damage the Kremlin’s ability to raise capital and generate revenue, according to the White House.

Restrictions on Russian Military Purchases

The U.S. will specifically target Russia’s means of expanding its military, Biden said Thursday. Blocking the country’s armed services from certain imports and financing will frustrate Putin’s strategic ambitions, the White House said.

The Biden administration is restricting exports of “nearly all” U.S. items–as well as products made in other countries using U.S. technology, equipment or software–to entities including the Russian Ministry of Defense, which includes the Armed Forces of Russia.

A Block on Russian Purchases of High-Tech U.S. Goods

With so much of the world’s technology originating in the U.S., the White House wants to strike a blow to Russia by curbing its access to those advances. Blocking Russia’s (non-military) high-tech imports has widespread implications—it could affect the entire Russian economy, including its defense industry, and ultimately stymie its long-term growth.

A Russia-wide block of U.S.-produced “sensitive technology” will land heavily on the defense sector. The U.S. will also restrict access to technology produced in other countries that relies upon things like American equipment and software, which could also affect the military, as well as Russia-wide access to smartphones, telecommunications, televisions, avionics, maritime tech, and game consoles.

“We estimate that we’ll cut off more than half of Russia’s high-tech imports,” Biden said.

3,466130ba-0e19-4ee9-aed4-a4ede10fc6f5,[],2022-02-24 00:00:00,"The U.S., alongside its allies in Europe and Asia, are “preparing to do more,” Biden said.

Notably, the president didn’t announce crushing sanctions on Russia’s energy sector, including conglomerates like Rosneft. He did say the sanctions might not have an immediate effect, but over time could prove punishing for Putin. “Let’s have a conversation in another month or so to see if they’re working,” he said.

The administration is concerned about global energy markets, a person familiar with the situation told POLITICO. Another person familiar said the focus of the sanctions this time around was on financial institutions.

A senior administration official told POLITICO before Biden’s speech that “no option is off the table,” but “starting out with energy could actually benefit Putin and pad his pockets. Given high oil and gas prices, cutting off Russian oil and gas will drive prices up to Putin’s benefit. And as we have said repeatedly on the record, on background [and] off the record, our sanctions are designed to harm Russia’s economy, not ours.”

Asked whether sanctions to be announced on both sides of the Atlantic will be big, a European official simply replied: “Yes.”

Biden also announced the deployment of ground and air forces to countries on NATO’s eastern front, including Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania — though he reiterated that U.S. troops won’t go into Ukraine to fight Russia.

Biden’s announcement came hours after Putin sent his troops into Ukraine from the north, east and south, while Russian warplanes and artillery units struck nearly 20 Ukrainian cities with precision-guided cruise missiles and conventional bombs. Ukrainian officials said more than 40 troops were killed and dozens of others were wounded. A senior defense official told reporters Thursday that Russia intends to “decapitate” the Ukrainian government and install its own puppet regime in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv.

Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken met their counterparts this morning in an extraordinary virtual meeting of the G-7 to discuss actions after the invasion, after which they agreed on a package of sanctions. That grouping was once known as the G-8, but Russia was kicked out because of its annexation of the Crimean Peninsula and incursion into Ukraine’s Donbas region in 2014.

The West’s sanctions strategy, for months, was intended to deter Moscow from further invading Ukraine. Now it is designed to punish Russia’s economy for Putin’s war and the actions of its forces in Ukraine. After Moscow’s troops entered two Kremlin-backed breakaway regions in the Donbas on Tuesday, the U.S. fully blocked two Russians banks from the global financial system, targeted five Russian elites and their families and curtailed access to the country’s sovereign debt.

Ukrainian leaders spent much of Thursday publicly messaging for Washington and European capitals to use all of their sanctions weapons on Russia at once.

“I will not be diplomatic on this,” Ukraine’s top diplomat Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter . “Everyone who now doubts whether Russia should be banned from SWIFT has to understand that the blood of innocent Ukrainian men, women and children will be on their hands too. BAN RUSSIA FROM SWIFT,” Kuleba wrote referring to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication.

A document obtained by POLITICO showed Kyiv was pushing the U.S. to cut off Russia from the SWIFT financial messaging system, place an embargo on Russian oil and gas, sanction nearly all of Moscow’s most important banks, and ban flights on any Russian carriers.

It’s widely expected that the final step in the sanctions escalation will be reserved for the capture of Kyiv, and will personally target Putin’s assets and prohibit the Russian Central Bank’s access to the U.S. dollar.

EU diplomats are questioning whether to include Putin on the new sanctions list or potentially wait for his next move that would trigger additional penalties. Proponents of sanctioning the Russian president now argue that the discussions on what should elicit such a response have been exhausted and not doing so immediately would convey weakness on the EU’s part.

Opponents of such a decision say it would be better to keep this option open in the hopes of using more diplomacy to end the conflict. “Feel free to add it to the reasons why I expect a lengthy discussion” tonight among leaders, one European diplomat said.

Biden refused to answer a question from the press about whether he would sanction Putin directly in future rounds, but said he had no plans to talk to the Russian leader.

4,466130ba-0e19-4ee9-aed4-a4ede10fc6f5,"['Abc News', 'February']",,"""Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war,"" Biden said from the White House.

After weeks of warning of ""severe"" sanctions if Russia invaded Ukraine, President Joe Biden addressed the nation and the world from the White House Thursday in what's unfolding as a defining moment in his presidency as President Vladimir Putin pressed a large-scale attack.

Biden announced escalated sanctions to correspond with the escalated Russian aggression, but not the full economic punishment Ukraine and others have called for and none yet on Putin himself, although he did say that option was ""not a bluff. It's on the table.""

""Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences,"" Biden said. ""Today, I am authorizing additional strong sanctions and new limitations on what can be exported to Russia. This is going to impose severe costs on the Russian economy, both immediately and over time.""

Biden announced new sanctions on four large Russian banks including VTB and SberBank, additional Russian elites and family members, and restrictions on Russia's sovereign debt to state-owned enterprises, which are companies whose assets exceed $1.4 trillion, to keep them from raising money.

However, Biden stopped short not only of sanctioning Putin himself but also of cutting Russia off from the SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) international banking system -- which would significantly hinder Russia's participation in global markets.

Pressed by reporters why not sanction Putin directly now, Biden deflected.

""Sir, sanctions clearly have not been enough to deter Vladimir Putin to this point,"" said ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Cecilia Vega. ""What is going to stop him? How and when does this end? And do you see him trying to go beyond Ukraine?""

""No one expected the sanctions to prevent anything from happening,"" Biden replied. ""It has to -- it's going to take time, and we have to show resolve. So, he knows what is coming. And so the people of Russia know what he's brought on them.""

Biden: 'Putin chose this war'

As a whole, Biden estimated the sanctions would ""cut off more than half of Russia's high-tech imports."" He said, ""We'll strike a blow to their ability to continue to modernize their military. It will degrade their aerospace industry, including their space program. It will hurt their ability to build ships, reducing their ability to compete economically. And it will be a major hit to Putin's long-term strategic ambitions.""

But it's still unclear whether the sanctions will make any difference in what Putin claimed overnight would be a ""special military operation"" in eastern Ukraine, which is proving to be much more widespread.

""To anyone who would consider interfering from the outside, if you do, you will face consequences greater than any you have faced in history,"" Putin warned the world.

While it was also still unclear just how far Putin would go beyond eastern Ukraine, Russian forces attacked near the capital city Kyiv -- raising new fears he would try to topple Ukraine's government.

Biden has maintained that U.S. forces will not fight Russians on the ground but announced he was authorizing additional U.S. force capabilities to deploy to Germany as part of NATO's response force.

""Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine but to defend our NATO allies and reassure those allies in the East. As I made crystal clear, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power,"" Biden said, adding the U.S. is prepared ""for additional moves, should they become necessary, to protect our NATO allies and support the greatest military alliance in the history of the world.""

The president also said that NATO would convene a summit Friday.

""This aggression cannot go unanswered,"" he added. ""If it did, the consequences would be much worse.""

Will Biden sanction Putin personally?

The Biden administration had threatened further sanctions on major Russian financial institutions and banks and to take steps to restrict Russian access to technology -- as it did Thursday -- but it had also weighed cutting Russia off from SWIFT and to directly sanction Putin's inner circle -- or the Russian president himself.

Pressed on why Biden hasn't gone that far, he reminded that some decisions must be made in unison with European allies.

""The sanctions that we are proposing on all their banks have the equal consequence, maybe more consequence than SWIFT, number one. Number two, it is always an option but right now that's not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take,"" Biden said.

Biden told reporters late last month that he would consider personally sanctioning Putin if Russia invaded Ukraine -- a day after 8,500 American forces were put on ""heightened alert"" in the region -- but those efforts did not appear to deter the Russian leader, nor did economic sanctions imposed this week by the U.S. and European allies, including halting the certification of Nord Stream 2, a major natural gas pipeline running from Russia to Germany.

The administration has begun to roll out a ""first tranche"" of sanctions, related to Russian banks, oligarchs and the natural gas pipeline Nord Stream 2, as some lawmakers have criticized Biden of not going far enough on sanctions, which haven't resulted in Russia reversing course.

With Thursday's announcement, the U.S. has targeted ten of Russia's largest financial institutions ""holding nearly 80% of Russian banking sector assets,"" the White House said.

Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell at a press event in Kentucky ahead of Biden's remarks called on the administration to ""ratchet the sanctions all the way up"" on Russia.

""Don't hold any back. Every single available tough sanction should be employed and should be employed now,"" McConnell said.

He said ""we honestly don't know"" if sanctions would be enough to deter Putin but argued harsher ones were still necessary.

Russian forces have already advanced from three directions -- from the south heading north, from Belarus heading south to Kyiv and from northeast of Ukraine heading to the south -- as Ukrainians woke up to a nation at war.

Biden argued Putin's ambitions are larger than Ukraine.

""He wants to in fact reestablish the former Soviet Union. That is what this is about,"" Biden said.

US military and intelligence assessment, diplomatic moves

U.S. intelligence believes these three axes were ""designed to take key population centers,"" a senior defense official said Thursday.

The White House promised ""united and decisive"" sanctions, but it remains to be seen how the West can punish Putin, who seems intent on moving ahead with his plans, despite weeks of attempted diplomacy from the international community and a set of sanctions already imposed.

As the Russian attack began overnight, Biden was on the phone within minutes with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who had reached out to him after receiving ""silence,"" he said, on a phone call to Putin. Russia has two tactical goals in Ukraine, according to Zelenskyy's office: seizing territory and toppling Ukrainian leadership.

Consequences -- for Americans

After their call, Biden released a statement saying that Putin ""has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering.""

The American president has acknowledged that there will be ""consequences at home"" -- particularly in energy prices -- as a result of the Russian invasion and subsequent sanctions, but vowed Thursday ""to do everything in my power to limit the pain the American people are feeling at the gas pump.""

However, ahead of his remarks, U.S. crude oil prices topped $100 a barrel, sending gasoline prices to an average of $3.54 a gallon, according to the American Automobile Association. At least three states had average gas prices of $4 or higher. Meanwhile, U.S. stock and Dow futures also plunged.

Addressing those concerns, Biden said the U.S. is working with countries to elevate collective release from the strategic petroleum reserves and that the U.S. will release additional barrels of oil ""as conditions warrant."" He also warned American oil and gas companies not to ""exploit this moment"" for profit.

Throughout the crisis, Biden has reminded Americans that the U.S. has a responsibility to defend its NATO allies -- and democracy around the world.

""America stands up to bullies,"" Biden said Thursday. ""We stand up for freedom. This is who we are.""

""Liberty, democracy, human dignity. These are the forces far more powerful than fear and oppression,"" he said. ""They cannot be extinguished by tyrants like Putin and his armies.""

Key point: On February 24, 2022, the United States imposed a combination of extensive and complex trade sanctions and export controls against the Russian Federation (Russia) in response to its invasion of Ukraine. These sanctions and export controls do not impose a full embargo on trade with Russia; however, U.S. companies doing business with Russia will be subject to extensive restrictions going forward, and many of those companies will need to terminate their transactions or activities immediately. These restrictions will be especially onerous for companies that produce U.S. export-controlled items. Even if your company’s transactions with Russia continue to be permissible, these new sanctions that target the Russian economy and financial system may make it difficult (or, in some instances, impossible) to make or receive payments associated with those transactions.

What should my company be doing to respond to these new requirements?

Companies doing business in or with Russia should carefully screen their counter-parties, the financial institutions involved in those transactions, and their ultimate beneficial owners against all applicable U.S. sanctions lists and should also carefully consider whether those transactions might involve “Military End Users” (as discussed in further detail below).

If your company has any letters of credit, performance guarantees or other financial instruments issued through any Russian financial institution, then you should determine whether those arrangements will violate these new sanctions.

It will be especially important to ensure that any products exported, reexported or transferred (in-country) to Russia are properly classified under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations. Depending on your products’ Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs), your transactions may be prohibited or may require export licensing.

In some instances, General Licenses may be available for you to continue or wind down specific transactions, but many of those General Licenses will expire within 30 days from February 24, 2022.

Also remember that these requirements are rapidly evolving and remain subject to change, so continue to closely monitor further Russia-related developments in U.S. sanctions and export controls policy.

Background information

Although tensions between the U.S. and Russia have been running high for several months, the conflict intensified on February 21, 2022 when Russian President Vladimir Putin formally recognized the Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) and Luhansk People’s Republic (LNR) regions of Ukraine as “independent states”. Over the following days, the Biden Administration responded to this declaration with the following trade sanctions measures:

Issuing Executive Order 14065 (EO 14065) on February 21, 2022 to impose a comprehensive sanctions embargo on the DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine (which we previously described in this blog post);

Imposing a “first tranche” of Russian sanctions on February 22, 2022, which imposed new restrictions on secondary market transactions involving Russian sovereign debt, and imposed blocking sanctions on Russia’s Vnesheconombank (VEB) and Promsvyazbank Public Joint Stock Company (PSB) banks as well as several Russian oligarchs and their immediate family members (which we previously described in this blog post); and

Imposing sanctions on Russia’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline on February 23, 2022 by adding Nord Stream 2 AG and its CEO Matthias Warning to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (the SDN List) maintained by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) (further discussed in this Press Statement issued by the U.S. State Department).

Conditions reached their boiling point on Thursday, February 24, 2022, when Russia proceeded to invade Ukraine. The U.S. responded by imposing a combination of extensive export controls and trade sanctions in alignment with its allies. In a Fact Sheet, the White House stated that these measures were intended to impose “severe and immediate economic costs on Russia.” These measures are described in further detail below and consist of: (i) a variety of sanctions targeted at the Russian financial sector, and (ii) highly technical export controls intended to “cut off more than half of Russia’s high-tech imports.”

Russia sanctions measures imposed on February 24, 2022

The U.S. Treasury Department issued a Press Release which stated, “These actions are specifically designed to impose immediate costs and disrupt and degrade future economic activity, isolate Russia from international finance and commerce, and degrade the Kremlin’s future ability to project power.” OFAC has provided a complete list of the individuals, entities and financial institutions subject to the below-described sanctions at this link. Additionally, OFAC has published many new FAQs to accompany these new sanctions and also updated several of its existing FAQs. A discussion of these new sanctions follows below.

Correspondent and payable-through account sanctions imposed on Sberbank

According to the U.S. Treasury Department, Sberbank is Russia’s largest financial institution and holds “about a third of all bank assets in Russia” and the “largest market share of savings deposits in the country.” In order to “restrict Sberbank’s access to transactions made in the dollar,” OFAC has named Sberbank and 25 of its worldwide subsidiaries to a List of Foreign Financial Institutions Subject to Correspondent Account or Payable-Through Account Sanctions (the CAPTA List). OFAC has also issued a new Directive 2 which, beginning March 26, 2022, will prohibit U.S. financial institutions from: (i) opening or maintaining correspondent account or payable-through accounts for or on behalf of any foreign financial institution named on the CAPTA List, and (ii) processing any transaction involving any foreign financial institution named on the CAPTA List.

This new Directive 2 will require U.S. financial institutions to reject any transactions involving Sberbank or any other CAPTA List foreign financial institution after its prohibitions take full effect. These Directive 2 restrictions also apply to any subsidiary foreign financial institutions in which Sberbank directly or indirectly holds an ownership interest of 50% or more, even if those subsidiary foreign financial institutions are not expressly identified on the CAPTA List. OFAC has indicated that it will consider adding more Russian financial institutions to the CAPTA List going forward.

Blocking sanctions imposed on VTB Bank and other major Russian financial institutions

OFAC has also imposed comprehensive blocking sanctions on VTB Bank, Public Joint Stock Company Bank Financial Corporation Otkritie (Otkritie), Open Joint Stock Company Sovcombank (Sovcombank), Joint Stock Commercial Bank Novikombank (Novikombank), and 54 of their subsidiaries by adding them to the SDN List. OFAC described VTB Bank as “Russia’s second largest financial institution, which holds nearly 20% of banking assets in Russia” and also noted that Otkritie, Sovcombank and Novikombank “play significant roles in the Russian economy, holding combined assets worth $80 billion.” These blocking sanctions also apply to any subsidiaries in which VTB Bank, Otkritie, Sovcombank or Novikombank directly or indirectly hold an ownership interest of 50% or more, even if those subsidiaries are not specifically identified on the SDN List. OFAC’s FAQ No. 982 also clarifies that these blocking sanctions also prohibit U.S. persons from buying or selling debt or equity of these Russian institutions (subject to General License No. 9, discussed in a later sub-section).

The blocking sanctions that apply to VTB Bank, Otkritie, Sovcombank and Novikombank are distinguishable from the CAPTA List sanctions which apply to Sberbank because the blocking sanctions take effect immediately and require U.S. financial institutions to freeze any funds belonging to VTB Bank, Otkritie, Sovcombank and Novikombank which are held in or which transit through the U.S. financial system (subject to General License No. 12, discussed below), whereas the Sberbank CAPTA List sanctions do not take effect until March 26, 2022 and permit U.S. financial institutions to reject (rather than freeze) funds transfers involving persons subject to the CAPTA List sanctions. However, OFAC has issued a General License No. 12 which allows U.S. financial institutions to reject (rather than freeze) transactions involving Otkritie, Sovcombank, VTB Bank or subsidiaries in which they hold an ownership interest of 50% or more, through March 26, 2022. OFAC has also issued a General License No. 11, which authorizes transactions ordinarily incident and necessary to the wind down of transactions involving Otkritie, Sovcombank, VTB Bank or subsidiaries in which they hold an ownership interest of 50% or more, through March 26, 2022. However, General Licenses Nos. 12 and 11 are not available for transactions that involve SDNs other than Otkritie, Sovcombank, VTB Bank or their blocked subsidiaries. Additionally, anyone seeking to rely on the authorizations provided under General Licenses Nos. 12 and 11 should consult OFAC FAQ No. 975, which discusses key limitations which apply to those General Licenses.

Restrictions on transactions in new debt and new equity

OFAC has named 13 major Russian companies in Annex 1 to a newly issued Directive 3, which will prohibit U.S. persons from transacting in, providing financing for or otherwise dealing in new debt with a tenure of longer than 14 days or new equity issued by these companies on or after March 26, 2022. According to the Treasury Department, these sanctions are intended to prohibit these companies from using U.S. markets “to support the further invasion of Ukraine”. The companies subject to these Directive 3 sanctions are a mix of financial services companies and other companies which the Biden Administration described as being “critical to the Russian economy.” Companies subject to these new Directive 3 sanctions include Gazprom (the world’s largest natural gas company), Rostelecom (Russia’s largest telecommunications company), RusHydro (a hydroelectricity company and one of Russia’s largest power companies), Alrosa (the world’s largest diamond mining company), Sovcomflot (Russia’s largest maritime and freight shipping company) and OJSC Russian Railways. It is worth noting, however, that some of these companies were already subject to similar restrictions under different Directives associated with OFAC’s existing Sectoral Sanctions Identifications List (the SSI List). OFAC has also confirmed that these new Directive 3 sanctions apply to any subsidiaries in which Directive 3 designees hold an ownership interest of 50% or more, even if those subsidiaries are not specifically identified in Directive 3’s Annex 1.

Sanctions on additional oligarchs and their family members

The Biden Administration continued its recent emphasis of targeting “influential Russians in Putin’s inner circle and in elite positions of power within the Russian state” and their immediate family members. As part of the day’s sanctions designations, OFAC imposed SDN List designations on three adult children of existing SDNs, three high-ranking Russian banking executives and the spouse of one of those sanctioned executives.

Sanctions on Belarusian defense sector and financial institutions

In another Press Release, OFAC added a total of 24 Belarusian individuals and entities to the SDN List due to “Belarus’s support for, and facilitation of the invasion.” These new designees include Belarussian Bank of Development and Reconstruction Belinvestbank, Bank Dabrabyt, multiple companies operating in the Belarusian defense sector, executives of those companies, and two high ranking officials in the Belarusian military. OFAC also issued a General License No. 6, which authorizes U.S. Government personnel to conduct transactions with Belarusian SDNs for the conduct of official U.S. Government business, and a General License No. 7, which authorizes the United Nations and other specific international organizations to conduct transactions related to their official business with Belarusian SDNs.

Additional OFAC general licenses

In addition to the General Licenses specifically discussed above, OFAC also issued the following General Licenses in order to authorize transactions that would otherwise be prohibited pursuant to these recent sanctions designations:

General License No. 5, which authorizes certain international organizations such as the Red Cross and certain global development banks to continue the conduct of their official business;

General License No. 6, which authorizes certain transactions ordinarily incident and necessary to: (1) exportation or reexportation of agricultural commodities, medicine and medical devices to, from or transiting the Russian Federation, and (2) the prevention, diagnosis or treatment of COVID-19;

General License No. 7, which authorizes certain transactions associated with overflights of the Russian Federation, emergency landings in the Russian Federation and the provision of air ambulance and related medical services to individuals in the Russian Federation;

General License No. 8, which authorizes transactions involving VEB Bank, Otkritie, Sovcombank, Sberbank, VTB Bank and subsidiaries which they directly or indirectly hold an ownership interest of 50% or more, provided that the transactions are “related to energy” and are concluded prior to June 24, 2022 (with General License No. 8 defining the phrase “related to energy” to mean “the extraction, production, refinement, liquefaction, gasification, regasification, conversion, enrichment, fabrication, transport or purchase of petroleum, including crude oil, lease condensates, unfinished oils, natural gas liquids, petroleum products, natural gas, or other products capable of producing energy, such as coal, wood or agricultural products used to manufacture biofuels, or uranium in any form, as well as the development, production, generation, transmission or exchange of power, through any means, including nuclear, thermal and renewable energy sources”);

General License No. 9, which authorizes transactions involving debt or equity issued prior to February 24, 2022 by VEB Bank, Otkritie, Sovcombank, Sberbank, VTB Bank and subsidiaries in which they directly or indirectly hold an ownership interest of 50% or more, provided that any such transactions must be concluded by May 25, 2022 and any divestment or transfer of such debt or equity may only be made to non-U.S. persons; and

General License No. 10, which authorizes transactions ordinarily incident and necessary to the wind down of certain derivative contracts entered into prior to February 24, 2022 which involve VEB Bank, Otkritie, Sovcombank, Sberbank, VTB Bank or subsidiaries in which they directly or indirectly hold an ownership interest of 50% or more, provided that such transactions must be concluded before May 25, 2022.

Anyone seeking to rely on any of these General Licenses should review them closely and ensure that they are in compliance with all associated conditions and requirements. Specifically, several of these General Licenses impose restrictions that will continue to prohibit the opening or maintaining of correspondent accounts or payable-through accounts in connection with the underlying transactions. Also, OFAC FAQ No. 978 requires that any funds transfers made in connection with General Licenses Nos. 6, 7 or 8 must be “ processed indirectly through a non-sanctioned, non-U.S. financial institution.”

Russia export controls measures imposed on February 24, 2022

The U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) imposed new Russia-focused export controls in a Final Rule posted online on Thursday, February 24, 2022. These new rules will vastly change the U.S. posture towards Russia with respect to export activities. Among other things, the Final Rule significantly increases the number of transactions with Russia that will require BIS licensing while also requiring BIS to impose a policy of denial when considering most of those applications. The Final Rule is effective immediately as of Thursday, February 24, 2022, subject to a limited savings clause which: (i) excludes certain shipments that would otherwise be covered under the Russia-related FDR Rules (discussed below) if they are en route as of March 26, 2022 pursuant to actual orders, and (ii) excludes all other shipments that would otherwise be subject to the Final Rule if they were en route pursuant to actual orders as of the date BIS filed the Final Rule for public inspection.

BIS administers the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), which regulate all exports, reexports and transfers within one country abroad (collectively, “export activities”) of “items subject to the EAR.” Such items include U.S.-origin items (which continue to be “subject to the EAR” after they leave the U.S.), foreign-origin items located in the U.S., and, increasingly, items produced abroad but that become “subject to the EAR” under either its de minimis content rule or one of several Foreign-Produced Direct Product Rules. A small number of other U.S. agencies also control export activities, but it is currently unclear whether those agencies will also be making Russia-specific updates to their regulations and operating procedures. Notably, the U.S. Department of State Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) has maintained a full arms embargo against Russia since March 18, 2021 (and before that a more limited license denial policy for certain high technology defense items since April 28, 2014).

The initial Background section of the Final Rule notes that it will be “implemented in parallel with similarly stringent measures by partner and allied countries [to] cover a broad scope of items that Russia seeks to advance its strategic ambitions and consequently impair [Russia’s] industrial sectors.” So far, public reporting indicates that Japan and the EU will also implement export controls on dual use goods such as semiconductors.

BIS policy of denial for Russia export license applications and limits on license exceptions availability

The Final Rule will generally require BIS to apply a policy of denial when reviewing applications associated with those transactions that will now require BIS licensing under the Final Rule. However, in certain limited circumstances the Final Rule authorizes BIS to apply a case-by-case review policy when reviewing Russia-related license applications. The limited transactions which are eligible for a case-by-case review policy include transactions involving export activities that:

Ensure flight safety;

Ensure maritime safety;

Meet humanitarian needs;

Support government space cooperation;

Support wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries, foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies that are joint ventures with other U.S. companies, joint ventures of U.S. companies headquartered in countries from Country Groups A:5 and A:6 (allies and partners), the wholly-owned subsidiaries of companies headquartered in Country Groups A:5 and A:6, and joint ventures of companies headquartered in Country Groups A:5 and A:6

Support civil telecommunications infrastructure by companies headquartered in Country Groups A:5 and A:6; and

Enable government-to-government activities.

When a transaction is eligible for the case-by-case review policy, the Final Rule requires BIS to primarily evaluate whether the transaction would benefit the Russian government or defense sector.

The Final Rule also significantly curtails the availability of License Exceptions for export activities to Russia. For example, License Exception ENC, which permits most export activities involving items designed or modified to use encryption, cannot be used to export/reexport/transfer to Russian “government end users” or state-owned enterprises (SOEs).

Expansion of commerce control list destination-based controls against Russia

The Final Rule creates a new EAR Russia export controls policy establishing that all export activities (except deemed exports and deemed reexports) to Russia involving items described in Categories 3 through 9 of the Commerce Control List (CCL) are now subject to a license requirement. This requirement will capture items under many Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs) that are often considered relatively innocuous because of their many civil uses, such as, but not limited to:

ECCN 3A991 – Integrated circuits and semiconductors meeting relatively low parameters.

ECCN 4A994.b – Personal computers and laptops meeting relatively low parameters.

ECCN 5A991 – Telecommunications devices such as modems, gateways and Internet of Things connected civil industry devices.

ECCN 9A991.d – Parts and components used in civil aircraft.

According to BIS, “Although these items are generally controlled at a lower level under the EAR, they are still necessary for the functioning of aircraft, vessels and electronic items. As such, restrictions on these items can significantly limit Russia’s ability to obtain items it is not able to produce”.

New Russia Military End-user / End-use Rule special treatment (the “Russia MEU Rule”)

Russia is included in a small list of countries subject to the EAR’s Military End-User / End-Use (MEU) Rule. The list also includes Burma, Cambodia, China and Venezuela. This conventional MEU Rule aims to prevent public and private military end-users from those five countries from receiving certain specified items contained in a list in Supplement No. 2 to Part 744 of the EAR. Now, effective February 24, 2022, under the “Russia MEU Rule,” Russia is subject to a more restrictive control where export activities involving all “items subject to the EAR” are prohibited for export/reexport/transfer to Russian MEUs, with the exception of (i) food and medicine designated as EAR99 and (ii) mass market hardware and software designed or modified to use encryption (ECCNs 5A992.c and 5D992.c) so long as those mass market items are not for Russian “government end users” or Russian SOEs. For purposes of the Russia MEU Rule, the EAR’s definition of MEU is extremely broad and can potentially capture any entity that is engaged in any operation, installation, maintenance, repair, overhaul, refurbishing, development or production of military items or other controlled aerospace items. For example, in certain circumstances, MEUs can even include hospitals and universities with military affiliations. There is also no exhaustive list of MEUs who are subject to the Russia MEU Rule, so persons engaging in transactions subject to the EAR with customers in Russia will carry the burden of analyzing whether their transactions involve Russian MEUs, even when exporting, reexporting or transferring EAR99 items conventionally thought of as “dual use” or “civil.”

Russian MEU-designated entities transferred to BIS entity list and two additional entities added

The End-User Review Committee (ERC) is a BIS-led interagency committee that determines which persons and entities should be specifically designated on any of BIS’ several lists. Simultaneous with BIS’ publication of the Final Rule, the ERC identified 45 Russian entities who were previously expressly listed on the BIS’s MEU List and moved them to the BIS Entity List with designations which generally require BIS licensing for “all items subject to the EAR,” subject to limited exceptions. In addition to transferring those 45 entities, the ERC also added two additional entities to the Entity List – the International Center for Quantum Optics and Quantum Technologies LLC, and SP Kvant – for a total of 47 designations. Persons who wish to engage in export activities to the newly listed entities on the BIS Entity List will likely be required to obtain a license, but should first review the License Requirement column because for some of those entities BIS will not require prior review for (i) food or medicine designated EAR99 and (ii) mass market hardware or software designed or modified to use encryption (ECCN 5A992.c or 5D992.c items).

Two novel versions of the EAR’s foreign-Produced Direct Product Rule

The Final Rule imposes two new versions of the Foreign-Produced Direct Product (FDP) Rule calibrated to deny Russia, and particularly Russia’s public and private defense sectors, the ability to obtain any items that are either (i) the direct product of certain types of U.S.-origin software or technology or (ii) produced by a complete plant or major component of a plant that is itself a direct product of certain types of U.S.-origin software or technology.

The first new rule, the “Russia FDP Rule,” establishes a license requirement for all such export activities involving foreign-produced direct products destined for Russia or that will be incorporated or used to produce or develop any part, component or equipment destined for Russia. The Russia FDP Rule applies to foreign-produced items that are the direct product of U.S.-origin technology or software classified in an ECCN provided in Categories 3 through 9 of the CCL. However, the Russia FDP Rule does ultimately exclude any foreign-produced items that would be designated EAR99.

The second new rule, the “Russia-MEU FDP Rule,” is much more restrictive and establishes the same license requirement as the Russia FDP Rule with two important differences: (i) it applies to foreign-produced items that are the direct product of U.S.-origin software or technology classified in any ECCN in any Category of the CCL, and (ii) if the Russia-MEU FDP Rule does capture a foreign-produced item, then it will still cause that item to be “subject to the EAR” even if it is designated as EAR99. However, although the Russia MEU FDP Rule is much more restrictive than the general Russia FDP Rule, the Russia MEU FDP Rule only applies to transactions involving parties listed on the Entity List and designated with a “footnote 3” designation (which generally applies to all of the previously-discussed Russian entities that the ERC moved from the MEU List to the Entity List).

Both the Russia FDP Rule and the Russia-MEU FDP Rule provide licensing exceptions for items that are exported or reexported from or transferred within certain allied countries that are listed in a new Supplement No. 3 to Part 746 added via the Final Rule. BIS has determined that these countries have adopted or agreed to adopt Russia-specific export control measures deemed substantially similar to those imposed under the Final Rule. According to BIS, the U.S. has already secured 32 countries’ commitments to implement export controls consistent with the Final Rule. Presumably BIS believes the allied countries’ export control regimes will be sufficient to prevent harmful exports/reexports/transfers to Russian MEUs.

As discussed above, the Russia FDP Rule and MEU-FDP Rule have a savings clause that allows for any items “en route aboard a carrier to a port of export, reexport or transfer (in-country) on March 26, 2022, pursuant to actual orders for reexport or transfer (in-country) to or within a foreign destination” to proceed to their destination without the specific licensing that would otherwise be required under the Russia FDP Rule or Russia MEU-FDP Rule. For shipments that qualify for this savings clause, the two novel FDP rules therefore do not become effective until March 27, 2022.

BIS embargo on annexed Crimea expanded to include the DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine

BIS maintains a general prohibition of all export activities involving “items subject to the EAR” to the Crimea region of Ukraine except for (i) food and medicine designated EAR99 and (ii) software necessary to enable the exchange of personal communications over the Internet. The policy now extends to the “Covered Regions of Ukraine,” which the Final Rule describes as the DNR and LNR regions. Notably, the Final Rule also adds definitions subparagraphs that define the “Crimea region of Ukraine,” the “Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) region,” the “Luhansk People’s Republic (LNR) region,” and “software necessary to enable the exchange of personal communications over the Internet.” Although OFAC has provided General Licenses which authorize certain transactions with the DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine, anyone seeking to provide items “subject to the EAR” to either region in any export activity must ensure that their transactions comply with both the OFAC General Licenses and the Final Rule’s licensing requirements. While the BIS license review policy for such transactions remains a presumption of denial, the Final Rule expands the limited availability of case-by-case reviews to all OFAC Ukraine-Related General Licenses, whereas that policy was previously limited to OFAC Ukraine-Related General License No. 4 covering the exportation or reexportation of agricultural commodities, medicine, medical supplies and replacement parts.

What measures were not implemented?

Despite speculation amongst the export compliance community, these sanctions did not go so far as to completely exclude Russia from accessing the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) system. However, the sanctions imposed on Sberbank, VEB, VTB and other Russian financial institutions will certainly make it much more difficult for Russia to perform day to day transactions in the global marketplace. The U.S. also has not moved to target the Russian energy sector and has instead provided an exception (discussed above) which will permit the U.S. financial system to conduct certain continuing transactions “related to energy” with the newly sanctioned Russian banks through at least June 24, 2022. When asked during a press conference whether the U.S. would impose additional sanctions, President Biden stated, “The sanctions we imposed [today] exceed anything that’s ever been done. The sanctions we imposed have generated two-thirds of the world joining us. They are profound sanctions. Let’s have a conversation in another month or so to see if they’re working.” There have also been recent reports that OFAC may soon levy sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov following comments by President Biden on Thursday that such an option was “on the table.”

6,466130ba-0e19-4ee9-aed4-a4ede10fc6f5,"['Tom Palmer', 'Sydney Kalich', 'Sean Noone']",2022-02-24 13:59:10+00:00,"(NewsNation Now) — Several more explosions were heard in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, late Thursday and early Friday, as Russian troops tried to advance on the capital from multiple directions.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said 137 civilians and military personnel have been killed.

“Horrific Russian rocket strikes on Kyiv,” Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba said in a statement. “Last time our capital experienced anything like this was in 1941 when it was attacked by Nazi Germany. Ukraine defeated that evil and will defeat this one. Stop Putin. Isolate Russia. Severe [sic] all ties. Kick Russia out of everywhete [sic].”

Ukrainian and Russian forces continued to engage throughout the embattled country. Among the developments overnight:

Russian troops entered the city of Sumy which is near the border with Russia and on a highway leading to Kyiv from the east. The regional governor, Dmytro Zhivitsky, said Ukrainian forces fought Russian troops in the city overnight, but other Russian convoys kept rolling west toward the Ukrainian capital. “Military vehicles from Sumy are moving toward Kyiv,” Zhivitsky said. “Much equipment has passed through and is heading directly to the west.”

Zhivitsky added that another northeastern city, Konotop, was also besieged.

A bridge across a river had been destroyed in the area of Ivankiv, about 40 miles northwest of Kyiv.

A Ukrainian government Facebook page showed images of badly damaged buildings that looked to be hit with Russian weaponry.

“The hardest day will be today. The enemy’s plan is to break through with tank columns from the side of Ivankiv and Chernihiv to Kyiv. Russian tanks burn perfectly when hit by our ATGMs (anti-tank guided missiles),” Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko said on Telegram.

Zelenskyy said the government had information that “subversive groups” were encroaching on the city, and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Kyiv “could well be under siege” in what U.S. officials believe is a brazen attempt by Russian President Vladimir Putin to dismantle the government and install his own puppet regime.

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told lawmakers on a phone call that Russian mechanized forces, which entered from Belarus, were about 20 miles from Kyiv, according to a person familiar with the call.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began early Thursday with a series of missile strikes, many on key government and military installations, quickly followed by a three-pronged ground assault. Ukrainian and U.S. officials said Russian forces were attacking from the east toward Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city; from the southern region of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014; and from Belarus to the north.

Male Ukrainian citizens aged 18 to 60 have been prohibited from leaving the country while martial law is in place. In a statement posted on Facebook, the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine said “departure from Ukraine is restricted” temporarily. It is forbidden to travel outside the borders of Ukraine [for] citizens of Ukraine, male gender between 18 to 60 years old.”

Diplomatic efforts will continue to try and pressure Russia. The U.N. Security Council will vote Friday on a resolution that would condemn Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine “in the strongest terms.” It also would demand an immediate halt to Russia’s invasion and the withdrawal of all Russian troops.

A senior U.S. official says the Biden administration knows the measure will be vetoed by Russia, but believes it is very important to put the resolution to a vote to underscore Russia’s international isolation.

President Joe Biden started Thursday with adding economic isolation for Russia when he announced a host of additional sanctions to punish Russia and President Vladimir Putin for what he called “a premeditated attack” on Ukraine.

Here’s what the sanctions seek to accomplish:

Cut Russia off from U.S. financial markets.

Freeze assets of major Russian banks.

Cut off an estimated 50% of Russia’s high tech-imports.

Target specific “Russian elites and family members.”

Deploy additional troops to Germany to support NATO allies.

Vow to respond to any cyberattacks against U.S. companies.

“We saw flagrant violations of international law,” Biden said. “Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war, and now he and his country will bear the consequences.”

The new package of sanctions aims to cut Russia off from U.S. financial markets and includes freezing the assets of four major Russian banks, including VTB Bank, the nation’s second-biggest bank, Biden said Thursday.

Speaking at the White House, Biden also announced sweeping export restrictions that would limit Russia’s ability to do business.

New export control measures could halt more than 50% of high-tech imports into Russia and severely limit its access to global exports of everything from commercial electronics and computers to semiconductors and aircraft parts.

Biden said it will “strike a blow” to Russia’s hopes of modernizing its military, its vaunted aerospace industry, its space program, shipping and other industry.

“It’s going to be a cold day for Russia,” Biden said.

Biden also acted to sanction several additional Russian oligarchs and elites, which cuts them off from the U.S. financial system, freezes any assets they hold in the U.S. and blocks their travel to the United States.

In light of Russia’s full-scale invasion, Biden also announced the deployment of additional U.S. troops to Germany to bolster NATO forces.

Some 7,000 service members from the 4th Infantry Division and the 3rd Armored Brigade Combat Team are slated to come from Fort Carson in Colorado, a senior defense official told NewsNation.

Biden has made clear that the U.S. would go after Russia financially, not militarily. The goal is to make Moscow pay so high a price that the Kremlin will change course.

“Our forces are not and will not be engaged in the conflict with Russia in Ukraine,” Biden said.

Key Takeaways of OFAC (Treasury) and BIS (Commerce) Actions

Major Russian Banks Blocked from the U.S. Financial System . Six major Russian banks — VEB, Promsvyazbank (PSB), VTB Bank, Otkritie, Sovcombank, and Novikombank — were named Specially Designated Nationals (SDNs), effectively cutting them off from any activity involving a U.S. person or U.S. bank.

Meanwhile, Sberbank was prohibited from U.S. correspondent or payable-through accounts, severely restricting the bank’s ability to conduct U.S. Dollar transactions. Numerous subsidiaries of those banks were also sanctioned.

Many Exports to Russia Prohibited Without a License. On March 3, 2022, the United States will use its export control regime to prohibit numerous U.S.-origin items, as well as non-U.S. items that are the product of U.S. technology or software, from being exported to Russia without a license. This effective prohibition covers a massive list of items and may affect exports across industries including materials processing, electronics, computers, telecommunications and information security, lasers and sensors, navigation and avionics, and marine transport.

General Licenses Provide a Brief Wind-Down Period . Many of the restrictions provide for U.S. persons to complete or wind down current transactions that would otherwise be prohibited within 30 days. Energy-sector transactions will have an authorized wind-down period of four months.

The United States has responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine with a slate of sanctions and export controls aimed at hobbling the finance and industry that supports the Russian military. The U.S. measures create risk for U.S. and non-U.S. entities doing business in Russia. Below we explore the nature and extent of those risks as they stand.[1]

U.S. Sanctions Against Russian Banks

SDN Designations

On February 22 and 24, 2022, President Biden and the U.S. Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced an array of sanctions targeting Russian banks.[2] Those sanctions include SDN designations of six major Russian banks, and their subsidiaries as follows:

Vnesheconombank (VEB), Russia’s foreign development bank, which was previously subject to U.S. SSI designations;

Promsvyazbank PJGS (PSB), a major finance source for the Russian military;

VTB, Russia’s second-largest financial institution;

Otkritie, a state-owned credit institution;

Sovcombank, the third largest privately owned financial institution in Russia by total assets, and Russia’s ninth largest bank overall; and

Novikombank, a Russian state-owned bank primarily serving the military and military suppliers.

When a bank is designated as an SDN, no U.S. person, including U.S. banks, may participate in any transaction involving that SDN. Further, if non-U.S. companies provide goods or services to, or material support for, any of those SDN banks, those non-U.S. companies risk also being sanctioned by the United States.

For that reason, the SDN designation often has the effect of keeping U.S. and non-U.S. parties, particularly banks, from engaging in transaction with the sanctioned SDN entity.

Prohibitions on U.S. Accounts For Sberbank

Sberbank. In a measure one step below the complete blocking of an SDN designation, the United States imposed sanctions on Sberbank and many of its subsidiaries and affiliates. Under those sanctions, no U.S. bank may open or maintain a correspondent or payable-through account for the sanctioned banks, nor may a U.S. bank process a transaction in which a sanctioned bank has an interest.

Although this sanction does not prohibit all U.S. persons from transacting with Sberbank, it will effectively restrict U.S.-person transactions involving Sberbank because no U.S. bank may process such a transaction.

Export Restrictions to Russia

Concurrent with the sanctions discussed above, the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) issued a rule requiring a license for the export of a broad array of items to Russia, both from the United States and from third countries. BIS will use the long arm of its “Foreign Direct Product Rule” to control non-U.S. items that are the direct product of certain U.S.-origin technology and software.

New Broad License Requirements

The new BIS rules add license requirements for the export of any items to Russia that fall under exports classification Categories 3-9 on the U.S. Commerce Control List (CCL). Most of those items were not previously controlled for exports to Russia. That requirement will apply even to certain low-level, commercial-off-the-shelf commodities, software, and technology in the fields of microelectronics, telecommunication, sensors, navigation equipment, avionics, marine and aircraft components. Further, the use of export license exceptions for those items will be substantially limited.

Review Policy

Applications for the export, reexport, or transfer of items that require a license for Russia will be reviewed under a policy of denial.

However, applications for exports, reexport or transfer of items related to the safety of flight, maritime safety, humanitarian needs, government space cooperation, civil telecommunications infrastructure, government-to-government activities, and support of limited operations of U.S. and allied countries subsidiaries and JVs companies in Russia will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

New Foreign Direct Product Rules

The new rule creates two new Foreign Direct Product Rules (FDPR) as follows:[3]

The Russia FDPR; and

The Russia-Military End User (MEU) FDPR.

Russia FDPR Russia-MEU FDPR The new Russia FDPR establishes controls over foreign produced items that are: The direct product of certain U.S. origin software or technology subject to the EAR; or Produced by certain plants or major components thereof that are themselves the direct product of certain U.S. origin software or technology subject to the EAR. Those new controls apply when exporters have knowledge that the foreign produced item is destined to Russia or will be incorporated into or used in the production or development of any parts, component, or equipment produced or destined to Russia. This FDPR does not apply to foreign-produced items that are designated EAR99. The Russia-MEU FDPR applies to foreign produced items that are: The direct product of any software or technology subject to the EAR that is on the Commerce Control List, or Produced by certain plants or major components thereof that are themselves the direct product of any U.S.-origin software or technology on the CCL. Such foreign produced end items will be subject to the EAR and require a license if an entity with a footnote 3 designation on the Entity List (see below) is a party to the transaction, or if there is knowledge that the item will be incorporated into or used in the production, development of any part, component or equipment produced, purchased, or ordered by such entity. Unlike the previous FDPR, this Russia-MEU FDPR applies to all items, including those designated as EAR99 subject to license authorization for footnote 3 designated Russian MEUs.

Entity List Footnote 3

The new rule will add dozens of parties to the U.S. Entity List and add a “Footnote 3” designation. Footnote 3 indicates that the Russia-MEU FDPR applies to that listed entity. For those entities, a license is required to export, reexport, or transfer all items subject to the EAR, including foreign produced items under the Russia-MEU FDPR.

Footnote 3 is also applicable for exports to the Russian Ministry of Defense, including the Armed Forces of Russia, wherever located. License applications for Footnote 3 designated entities will be reviewed under a policy of denial.

As of publication, a total of 45 entities have been transferred from the MEU List to the Entity List and are now designated under Footnote 3. BIS is also adding two new Russian Entities with a footnote designation. Additional entities may be added in the future.

New MEUs restrictions

Restrictions on Russian MEUs and military end-uses now cover all items subject to the EAR with the exception of food and medicine designated as EAR99, and items designated as ECCN 5A992.c or 5D992.c; unless those are for Russian government end-users or Russian state-owned enterprises.

Further U.S. Sanctions Against Russia

Debt and Equity Prohibitions

The United States also fired a shot at Russian capabilities for financing activity such as the Ukraine invasion. Directive 3 under E.O. 14024, prohibits U.S. persons from dealing in the debt of longer than 14 days maturity or the equity of certain Russian banks and state-owned businesses, as follows:

Sberbank

Russian Agricultural Bank

Gazprombank

Gazprom

Gazprom Neft

Transneft

Rostelecom

RusHydro

Alrosa

Sovcomflot

Russian Railways

Alfa-Bank

Credit Bank of Moscow

Additionally, sanctions prohibit participation in the secondary market for bonds issued after March 1, 2022 by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, the National Wealth Fund of the Russian Federation, or the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.

Designation of Russian Oligarchs

The United States government views the elite circle of oligarchs that surround Putin as some of the most powerful people in Russia. Many of those individuals have worked to support the regime’s illegal invasion of Ukraine and have used family members to move assets and to conceal wealth they have effectively stolen from the Russian people. For that reason, the U.S. designated as SDNs many of these individuals.

U.S. Sanctions on Nord Stream 2

OFAC also took aim at a massive project for the Russian government and Russian oil and gas industry, the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a project that would run from northwestern Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea. While Germany has effectively halted the project, the United States has added the Swiss company in charge of building Russia’s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, and its German chief executive officer, Matthias Warnig, to the SDN List.
