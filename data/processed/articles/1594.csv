VERSAILLES, France -- European Union leaders said on Friday they will continue applying pressure on Russia by devising a new set of “massive” sanctions to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine while stepping up military support for Kyiv.

Speaking at the conclusion of a two-day EU summit outside Paris, French President Emmanuel Macron said all options are on the table for a fourth package of coercive measures targeting Russia if President Vladimir Putin escalates his war efforts.

If Putin “intensifies the bombing, lays siege to Kyiv and intensifies the scenes of war, we know that we will have to take massive sanctions again,” Macron said.

Since the war started last month, the EU has adopted tough measures targeting Putin, Russia’s financial system and its high-maintenance oligarchs. Earlier this week, the bloc’s nations agreed to slap further sanctions on 160 individuals and added new restrictions on the export of maritime navigation and radio communication technology.

They also decided to exclude three Belarusian banks from SWIFT, the dominant system for global financial transactions. Altogether, EU restrictive measures now apply to a total of 862 individuals and 53 entities.

The head of the EU’s executive arm, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, said the arsenal of sanctions has already started to take a toll on Russia’s economy.

“You see that the ruble is in freefall. It has lost more than 50% compared to the euro,” she said. “You see that there are skyrocketing interest rates in Russia. You see a soaring inflation. The rating agencies do rate the Russian bonds as junk by now.”

Among possible new measures against Russia and its ally Belarus, cutting all their banks from SWIFT is a discussed option. A total embargo on fossil fuels imports from Russia similar to the one imposed by Washington could also be approved at some point, Macron warned.

“Nothing is forbidden, nothing is taboo,” he said. “We will do everything we consider effective to stop Russia in this path of aggression.”

Efforts to agree on a boycott are complicated because some EU countries, including Germany and Italy, are much more dependent than others on Russia. Poland gets 67% of its oil from Russia, while Ireland receives only 5%.

Italian Premier Mario Draghi sounded skeptical that Putin’s goal is to reach a peace agreement. “To have peace, you have to want it,” Draghi told reporters. Putin, he said, “doesn’t want peace.”

As for sanctions, Draghi said that those already imposed are “very heavy and were adopted by all member countries without hesitation. They can become even heavier.”

Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel said threatening Russia with new sanctions should be used to obtain a quick cease-fire.

“We need to apply high pressure and be successful,” he said.

To support Ukraine, Borrell said he proposed to leaders to inject an extra €500 million euros into the EU fund for military aid, as Russia widens its military offensive. On Friday, Russia struck near airports in the west of the country for the first time as troops kept up pressure on the capital, Kyiv.

“I made the proposal to double our contribution,” Borrell said. “This is what we are going to do. ... And it is going to be done immediately.”

The EU had previously agreed to spend 450 million euros ($500 million) on military supplies for Ukrainian forces in an unprecedented step of collectively supplying weapons to a country under attack. EU countries and NATO have excluded the option of a direct military intervention in Ukraine.

In a statement published after the summit, von der Leyen said the fourth package of sanctions will further isolate Russia “and drain the resources it uses to finance this barbaric war.""

She said the EU will work in lockstep with Group of Seven countries to ramp up the pressure against Moscow.

“We will deny Russia the status of most-favored-nation in our markets,"" she said. “This will revoke important benefits that Russia enjoys as a WTO (World Trade Organization) member. Russian companies will no longer receive privileged treatment in our economies.""

Von der Leyen added that Western allies will also aim to suspend Russia’s membership rights in leading multilateral financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

“We will ensure that Russia cannot obtain financing, loans, or any other benefits from these institutions,"" she said.

Italian Premier Mario Draghi sounded deeply skeptical that Putin’s goal is to reach a peace agreement.

“To search for peace, one has to want it,” he said. “Today he doesn’t want it. The plan seems to be something else. I hope that as soon as possible some glimmer (of hope for peace) can be realized.”

Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has sought to join the EU and NATO, has called for fast-track accession to the EU since the Feb. 24 invasion.

""I understand very well that, when you fight courageously like Ukraine does, you would want much more. But we are not a side to this conflict,"" French President Emmanuel Macron told a news conference.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said it was ""right"" to hand the request of Ukraine, as well as that of Moldova and Georgia, for prospective membership to the bloc's executive European Commission for a detailed legal analysis.

Allies of Ukraine in eastern Europe were disappointed.

""I wish Ukraine would get the candidate status now... it was not possible today, but we will come back to this issue,"" said Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda.

EU countries must agree unanimously to let in a new member and accession usually takes years of complex negotiations, as well as requiring candidates to meet strict criteria from economic stability to rooting out corruption and respecting human rights.

The bloc's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said the EU might offer another 500 million euros ($550 million) to Ukraine to buy arms. The bloc also promised to help rebuild the country of 44 million people once the war ends.

SANCTIONS

The EU also threatened further sanctions on Moscow.

""Nothing is off the table, nothing is taboo, we'll do whatever we deem necessary to stop Russia,"" Macron said after talks in the Versailles palace near Paris.

Scholz confirmed: ""We agreed to continue to push forward on those sanctions that have an immediate effect on Russia's chances for economic development.""

Like EU enlargement, sanctions require unanimity of all member countries. The 27 members have yet to find common ground on how much further to go in cutting business ties with Russia.

As a next step, the West was curbing Russia's rights at the the World Trade Organisation.

The leaders also turned inwards to discuss ways to reduce their economic exposure to Moscow. They decided to cut imports of Russian energy by 2027, spend more on defence and increase own food production. read more ($1 = 0.9137 euros)

France stands united with Ukraine in this humanitarian emergency

The Russian military invasion of Ukraine has led to a serious humanitarian crisis. Millions of Ukrainians have left their homes to flee fighting and bombing since the beginning of the Russian offensive. Some have sought refuge elsewhere in the country and outside of Ukraine’s borders.

The Crisis and Support Centre (CDCS) of the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs is working to support victims and refugees in this humanitarian emergency.

France has released €100 million to finance the most urgent humanitarian supplies, such as medication, respirators, tent and blankets. A humanitarian airbridge has been set up through Poland to deliver these supplies to authorities in Ukraine or directly to the neighbouring countries taking in refugees.

In order to rally all goodwill efforts and quickly and effectively raise financial contributions to France’s humanitarian operations, two funds have been set up:

• FACECO: a fund for local authorities

• A support fund for businesses

Sanctions on Russia

On 27 February, leaders of the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States and Japan announced further restrictive economic measures against Russia. These measures have been imposed on the main Russian banks and institutions, as well as war leaders, including the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, with the aim of further isolating Russia from the international financial system and our economies.

Situations of crisis or armed conflict create fertile ground for violating the rights of children and in particular illegal practices in intercountry adoption. No intercountry adoption procedure may be initiated in such contexts, on account of the difficulty in determining whether the children, who may appear orphaned or definitively without parental care, are truly eligible for adoption.

The Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs has therefore made the decision to suspend intercountry adoptions with these two countries, for a period of three months, renewable.

Origin of the conflict

The conflict between Ukraine and the Russian Federation broke out during a political crisis in Ukraine in late November 2013. Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych’s decision to suspend the process leading to the signing of an Association Agreement with the European Union caused a “revolution of dignity” (Euromaidan).

In Crimea, masked Russian soldiers without insignia took control of all the strategic points in the region on 27 February 2014. On 16 March 2014, a “referendum” for independence and attachment to the Russian Federation was held. The international community did not recognize this annexation.

At the same time, a destabilization operation was launched in eastern Ukraine. In March 2014, armed groups without insignia under Russian control supported the demonstrators calling for the independence of these regions. On 11 May, the de facto entities of the “Donetsk People’s Republic” and of the “Luhansk People’s Republic” declared their independence following a “referendum”. This vote, held outside of the framework established by Ukrainian legislation and marred by a number of irregularities, was considered illegal by Ukraine and was not recognized by the international community (including the Russian Federation).

France supported the European Union’s sanctions in response to the illegal annexation of Crimea and the destabilization of Ukraine.

The Minsk Agreements aiming to end the conflict

Diplomatic negotiations began in June 2014. The 6 June 1944 D-Day Commemorations provided an opportunity to start diplomatic discussions between the Ukrainian and Russian Presidents under the auspices of the President of the French Republic and German Chancellor in the Normandy Format or N4.

Negotiations were also launched in Minsk in the Trilateral Contact Group including representatives of Ukraine, Russia and mediated by the Chairperson-in-Office of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) as well as involving separatists (representatives of “certain regions of Luhank and Donetsk oblasts”) in four working groups.

On 5 September 2014, the Trilateral Contact Group parties signed the Minsk Protocol (in FR): 13 political and security measures aiming to end the conflict.

On 11 and 12 February 2015, the Normandy Format Summit of Heads of State and Government was held in Minsk. The Trilateral Contact Group parties signed the Package of Measures for the Implementation of the Minsk Agreements (at times mistakenly called “Minsk II”) (in FR).

This Package of Measures sets out the operational stages for implementing the Minsk Protocol. Its intention is to advance the security situation on the ground and the political process jointly without preconditions. Ultimately, its objective is for the separatist-held zones to be re-integrated under Ukrainian sovereignty with decentralized organization.

United Nations Security Council Resolution 2202, which was adopted on 17 February 2015, endorsed this Package of Measures and called for its full implementation. This Package of Measures resulted in a significant drop in the number of victims, with three-quarters of the approximately 13,300 deaths caused by the conflict occurring before it was signed. But the crisis persists due to the parties’ lack of political will to deliver on their commitments. Tensions continue to fuel the Russian-Ukrainian conflict on a regular basis.

In Crimea, Ukraine has not restored its sovereignty and its territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders. In August 2021, it launched an international platform of support for Crimea’s return under Ukrainian sovereignty.

In eastern Ukraine, repeated ceasefire violations directly threaten civilians and the humanitarian situation is still very critical, particularly for the most vulnerable people (elderly people).

The year 2019 was marked by the election of Volodymyr Zelenskyy as President of Ukraine. He received more than 73% of votes and made resolving the conflict a priority of his term of office.

Since he was elected, several advances have been made on the ground:

• The ceasefire of 21 July led to an unprecedented decrease in violence;

• The disengagement was successful in three pilot zones (Stanytsia Luhanska, Petrivske, and Zolote);

• The bridge in Stanytsia Luhanska was rebuilt making it easier for civilians to travel around the contact line;

• In December 2019 then in April 2020, two exchanges of prisoners involved in the conflict led to the release of a total of 239 elderly people from both sides;

• Additional ceasefire consolidation measures were enacted on 27 July 2020.

Moreover, Russia and Ukraine proceeded to exchange 70 political prisoners (different from those held in relation to the conflict since 2014), including the film director, Oleh Sentsov, and the 24 Ukrainian sailors held since 25 November 2018 following a serious naval incident in the southern part of the Kerch Strait.

France does not and will not recognize the illegal annexation of Crimea: the redrawing of international borders by force is a breach of international law and of the commitments made by the Russian Federation.

France hosted another Normandy Format Summit of Heads of State and Government on 9 December 2019, following on from the last Summit held in October 2016 in Berlin. At this Summit, a number of measures to improve the situation and to facilitate the implementation of the Minsk Agreements were made, including consolidating the ceasefire, making progress related to mine clearance, opening new crossing points, identifying new areas of disengagement, and exchanging prisoners taken during the conflict. The parties also reiterated their commitment to seeing that progress is made regarding all the legal aspects related to the political component of the Minsk Agreements.

Normandy Format political advisers have continued to hold discussions since, despite the difficulties caused by the COVID-19 epidemic. On 26 January 2022, they met in Paris and issued a joint statement, the first since the Paris Summit, affirming their willingness to pursue work in the Normandy Format.

See Statement of the Advisers of the Heads of State and Government of the Normandy Format, 26 January 2022

France has had a policy of firmness, dialogue and solidarity with Ukraine to move towards a political settlement of the conflict and to help de-escalation since the increase in tensions with Russia on the Ukrainian border at the end of 2021. In light of this, the French President and the Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs travelled to Kyiv on 8 February 2022, following a visit to Moscow on 7 February 2022. France reiterated that any new attack on Ukrainian sovereignty would lead to massive, costly sanctions for Russia.

Executive Order 13660 , signed on March 6, 2014, authorizes sanctions on individuals and entities responsible for violating the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, or for stealing the assets of the Ukrainian people. These sanctions put in place restrictions on the travel of certain individuals and officials and showed our continued efforts to impose a cost on Russia and those responsible for the situation in Crimea.

Executive Order 13661 , issued on March 17, 2014, under the national emergency with respect to Ukraine that find that the actions and policies of the Russian government with respect to Ukraine -– including through the deployment of Russian military forces in the Crimea region of Ukraine –- undermine democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine; threaten its peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; and contribute to the misappropriation of its assets.

A new Executive Order, “Blocking Property of Additional Persons Contributing to the Situation in Ukraine,” issued on March 20, 2014, expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660 of March 6, 2014, and expanded by Executive Order 13661 of March 16, 2014, finding that the actions and policies of the Government of the Russian Federation, including its purported annexation of Crimea and its use of force in Ukraine, continue to undermine democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine; threaten its peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; and contribute to the misappropriation of its assets, and thereby constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.

Executive Order 13685 was issued December 19, 2014. Utilizing these Executive Orders, the United States has steadily increased the diplomatic and financial costs of Russia’s aggressive actions towards Ukraine. We have designated a number of Russian and Ukrainian entities, including 14 defense companies and individuals in Putin’s inner circle, as well as imposed targeted sanctions limiting certain financing to six of Russia’s largest banks and four energy companies. We have also suspended credit finance that encourages exports to Russia and financing for economic development projects in Russia, and are now prohibiting the provision, exportation, or re-exportation of goods, services (not including financial services), or technology in support of exploration or production for deepwater, Arctic offshore, or shale projects that have the potential to produce oil in the Russian Federation, or in maritime area claimed by the Russian Federation and extending from its territory, and that involve five major Russian energy companies.

These actions, in close coordination with our EU and international partners, send a strong message to the Russian government that there are consequences for their actions that threaten the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. The United States, together with international partners, will continue to stand by the Ukrainian government until Russia abides by its international obligations. The United States is prepared to take additional steps to impose further political and economic costs. A secure Ukraine, integrated with Europe and enjoying good relations with all its neighbors, is in the interests of the United States, Europe, and Russia.

Executive Order 13694 was issued on April 1, 2015 and authorized the imposition of sanctions on individuals and entities determined to be responsible for or complicit in malicious cyber-enabled activities that result in enumerated harms that are reasonably likely to result in, or have materially contributed to, a significant threat to the national security, foreign policy, or economic health or financial stability of the United States. The authority has been amended to also allow for the imposition of sanctions on individuals and entities determined to be responsible for tampering, altering, or causing the misappropriation of information with the purpose or effect of interfering with or undermining election processes or institutions in E.O. 13757.

Executive Order 13757 issued on December 28, 2016, amends EO 13694. E.O. 13757 focuses on specific harms caused by significant malicious cyber-enabled activities, and directs the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, to impose sanctions on those persons he determines to be responsible for or complicit in activities leading to such harms. The U.S. Department of State and other U.S. government agencies work to identify individuals and entities whose conduct meets the criteria set forth in E.O. 13694, as amended, and designate them for sanction under the delegated authority of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Persons designated under this authority are added to OFACS’s list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN List).",https://www.state.gov/ukraine-and-russia-sanctions/

Moscow has withdrawn its forces from those regions to focus on eastern Ukraine, but airstrikes have continued.

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

Should the Kremlin press on with its war on its neighbour, the French President said that Moscow faces further major economic punishment.

Marcon also sent a warning to the rest of the world, saying the on-going war will 'deeply destabilise' food supplies in Europe and Africa, as some of the world's most fertile agricultural land in both Russia and Ukraine goes unplanted.

Between them, Russia and Ukraine export around 25 percent of the world's wheat.

'If things continue in the military way... we will take further sanctions, including massive sanctions,' Macron said after a summit of EU leaders in the Palace of Versailles in Paris on Friday.

The West has already imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia after Putin ordered his forces into Ukraine on February 24, crippling the country's economy.

But in a warning to his counterpart in Moscow who he has spoken to on numerous occasions in recent weeks, Macron said the EU was prepared to go even further.

His comments also came as US President Joe Biden announced the U.S. will dramatically downgrade its trade status with Russia as punishment for its invasion, and also ban imports of Russian seafood, alcohol and diamonds.

The broad trade shift, which revokes the 'most favored nation' status for Russia, is being taken in coordination with the European Union and G7 countries.

'We have the means to bear the cost of sanctions, counter-sanctions and to protect our economies,' Macron told a news conference in Versailles, near Paris.

But he also said measures his government had taken in France to shield consumers from rising energy prices were temporary and could not cover the whole inflationary shock consumers will face.

'Governments are not here to swallow the whole inflationary effect,' Macron said.

The sanctions have crippled the Russian economy, and Macron's comments are a sign that the EU and its allies will continue to use their financial heft to retaliate against Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Countries in the European Union - along with the likes of Britain, the United States, Canada and Australia - have frozen the assets of Russia's central bank, placed limits on its exports, and imposed sanctions against Russian oligarchs and their families.

Some have also moved to ban imports of Russian oil and gas products, and reduce their dependence on Russian resources.

Many Western companies have also pulled out of the country.

A destroyed tank is seen after battles between Ukrainian and Russian forces on a main road near Brovary, north of Kyiv, Ukraine, Thursday, March 10, 2022. The West has already imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia after President Vladimir Putin ordered his forces into Ukraine on February 24, and the EU warned Vladimir Putin today that more could be on the way

These financial tools have led to the Russian rouble losing 76% of its value against the US dollar over the past month, which has caused destructive inflation that could erode Mr Putin's ability to wage a prolonged war in Ukraine.

However, the European Union is more reliant on the Kremlin's gas than the likes of the US and Britain, receiving around 40 percent of the resource from Russia.

This means money is still flowing from the bloc across its eastern border, and on Wednesday the bloc's foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, said Putin has been able to fund his war machine thanks to EU gas and oil payments.

With the EU imposing widespread sanctions, there is also a concern that Putin could turn off the taps in realisation, causing an energy crisis across the continent.

Macron also warned that Russia's invasion of Ukraine will 'deeply destabilise' food supplies in Europe and Africa.

Russia is the world's largest exporter, and produced 37,267,014 tonnes of the crop in 2020 - or 17.6 percent of the world's total exports.

Ukraine meanwhile was the world's fifth largest exporter of wheat, providing 18,055,673 tonnes of the crop - eight percent of total exports.

In recent days, prices have already started to rise, with the cost of wheat, maize and soya beans already rising above 2008 levels.

'Europe and also Africa will be very deeply destabilised as regards food because of what can't be planted right now in Ukraine,' Macron told reporters after an EU leaders' meeting at Versailles Palace.

'We will have to prepare for that and re-evaluate our production strategies to defend our food sovereignty... but also to be able to define a strategy concerning Africa.'

Without it, he warned, 'several African countries will be affected by famines within 12 to 18 months precisely because of the war.'

The European Union is also considering sending another 500 million euros in military support to Ukraine.

EU leaders meeting for the summit in France's Palace of Versailles described Moscow's attack on Ukraine as a wake-up call for the 27-nation bloc to take a more muscular approach to ensuring its security.

'There's no denying the fact that two weeks ago we woke up in a different Europe, in a different world,' European Council chief Charles Michel said.

Members of the press work as European Council President Charles Michel, French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen hold a press conference following an EU leaders summit to discuss the fallout of Russia's invasion in Ukraine, at the Palace of Versailles, near Paris, on March 11, 2022

The EU's executive put forward a proposal to double its financing for sending weapons to Ukraine to one billion euros as the West scrambles to back Kyiv's forces in the face of the Kremlin's onslaught.

The bloc last month broke a long-standing taboo by agreeing to pay for arms deliveries to Ukraine after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the invasion of his pro-Western neighbour.

The move was part of a broad push by Ukraine's allies to send weapons amid desperate pleas from Kyiv for air defence systems after calls to impose a no-fly zone were rebuffed.

Alongside further arms supplies, EU leaders also said they were readying a fresh round of economic punishment as they look to keep up pressure on Putin over the bloodshed.

Meanwhile, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz underlined the importance of keeping in contact with Putin, but stressed that 'we will not make decisions for the Ukrainians.'

Scholz and Macron, who has spoken frequently with the Russian leader, together spoke to Putin on Thursday. After the EU summit on Friday, Scholz said 'it is absolutely necessary that we do not let the thread of talks break.'

Macron said he and Scholz would speak again with Putin later Friday.

Scholz stressed that he and Macron are consulting closely among themselves and with the Ukrainian leadership - and that a cease-fire is the top priority.

Scholz said it's good that there are talks, but they shouldn't just drag on while 'weapons every day destroy people's lives, buildings, infrastructure and dreams.'

The chancellor said that there is 'one very clear principle: we will not make decisions for the Ukrainians. They must know themselves what from their point of view is the right thing for their country in this threatening situation.'

Finnish President Sauli Niinisto also spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin about the war in Ukraine in a phone call on Friday.

Niinisto's office said in a statement that he informed Putin that he, earlier in the day, had a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and that Zelensky was prepared to talk directly with Putin.

The statement said Niinisto called for an immediate ceasefire and the safe evacuation of civilians, but also spoke to Putin about the security of nuclear energy facilities in Ukraine.

Niinisto is one of the few Western leaders who has kept a regular dialogue with Putin ever since the Finnish leader took office in 2012.

While most EU leaders struck a tone of defiance against Putin on Friday, Hungary's prime minister Victor Orban looked to reassure his own people by saying that sanctions imposed against Russia by the EU would not involve a ban on imports of Russian oil and gas.

In a video on his social media channels following the Versailles meeting, Orban said it was possible that the war in Ukraine 'would drag on,' but that 'the most important issue was settled in a way that was favourable to us.'

'There will be no sanctions covering oil and gas, which means that Hungary's energy supply is guaranteed for the next period,' Orban said.

Orban, widely considered to be the Kremlin's closest ally in the EU, has supported the bloc's sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, Hungary's neighbor.

But he has remained firm in insisting that the energy sector be left out of sanctions, arguing that such a move would damage EU countries more than Russia.

Last year, Hungary extended by 15 years a natural gas contract with Russian state-owned energy company Gazprom, and has entered into a 12 billion-euro ($13.6 billion) Russian build-and-finance agreement to add two nuclear reactors to Hungary's only nuclear power plant.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10603277/The-EU-threatens-Russia-tougher-sanctions.html
