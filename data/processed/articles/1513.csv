EU could boost renewables as it cuts Russian energy imports

Brussels may set more ambitious renewable energy targets as it tries to wean itself off Russian fossil fuel imports, EU climate policy chief Frans Timmermans said.

EU member states have agreed to reduce their net greenhouse gas emissions by 55% from 1990 levels by 2030, a step towards ""net zero"" by 2050.

Under current plans, the EU is set to grow the share of renewable energy to 40% by 2030. But Timmermans said the bloc could now push for a ""higher percentage of renewable energy"" by the same deadline.

He thinks EU countries could boost imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the short term but then quickly move towards more renewables.

World Bank: Ukraine economy to plunge by nearly half

Ukraine's economic output will likely contract by a staggering 45.1% this year, the World Bank said in a new report.

It said Russia's invasion has shut down businesses, slashed exports and rendered economic activity impossible in many parts of the country.

In its ""War in the Region"" update, the bank estimated that over half of the country's firms are closed, while others are operating at well under normal capacity.

The closure of Black Sea shipping from Ukraine has cut off some 90% of the country's grain exports and half of its total exports.

The bank also forecast Russia's 2022 GDP output to fall 11.2% due to punishing financial sanctions imposed by the West.

Economists said GDP in the Eastern Europe region, comprising Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, is forecast to contract by 30.7% this year, due to shocks from the war and disruption of trade.

Klitschko brothers: Russian troops will target Kyiv again

Russia's military will return to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko and his brother Wladimir have warned. And when they do, the pair said, Ukraine will need weapons to repel the advance.

In an interview with ABC News, Wladimir Klitschko pleaded for the world to isolate Russia economically, saying ""every cent that Russia is getting, they're using for weapons to kill us.""

Vitali Klitschko spoke of the shocking discovery of the bodies of hundreds of civilians after the Russians retreated from Kyiv. He called it genocide to kill women, children, old people and teenagers for no reason.

To defend Ukraine now, the mayor said, is to defend democracy and peace in Europe.

White House: Biden-Modi set for fresh talks on Ukraine

US President Joe Biden and his Indian counterpart will discuss the Ukraine conflict during a virtual meeting on Monday, the White House has said.

Biden will use the talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi to continue ""close consultations"" on the consequences of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, along with the impact on global food security, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.

New Delhi has so far refused to condemn Moscow through the United Nations, although it has said it was deeply disturbed by the alleged killings of civilians by Russian troops in the town of Bucha.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who met with Modi in New Delhi in early April, has praised India for its approach to the conflict.

Prominent Russian rights activist arrested

Oleg Orlov, a leader of the now-banned human rights organization Memorial, Russia's oldest rights group, was arrested after staging a one-man protest of his country's invasion of Ukraine in Moscow's Red Square.

Members of Memorial shared a video of Orlov with a sign that read, ""Our willingness to know the truth and our silence, makes us conspirators in this crime,"" before he was taken away by police. It is Orlov's fourth such arrest.

The protest monitoring group OVD-Info also said one other arrest occurred of a man wearing the blue and yellow of the Ukrainian flag in front of Moscow city hall.

US: Russia appoints new war commander

US national security advisor Jake Sullivan told CNN that Russia has appointed a new war commander, General Alexander Dvornikov.

The 60-year-old general is among Russia's most experienced military officials, US officials say. They added he has a record of brutality in Syria and elsewhere.

Sullivan said, ""This general will just be another author of crimes and brutality against Ukrainian civilians.""

He added, ""No appointment of any general can erase the fact that Russia has already faced a strategic failure in Ukraine.""

Dvornikov previously served in the second Chechen war and had several senior roles before he was placed in charge of Russian forces in Syria in 2015.

The US national security advisor added Russia's decision to target civilians ""lies at the feet of the Kremlin.""

Russia's VTB no longer in control of European subsidiary

Germany's banking regulator said it stripped Russian bank VTB of control over its Germany-based subsidiary VTB Bank SE. In a statement, the financial authority said VTB ""no longer has control"" over the Europe-based firm.

VTB will no longer be able to access its subsidiary's financial assets as the subsidiary has been ""completely isolated"" from Russian VTB.

The European entity can continue to function, but its board is not permitted to take directives from Russian VTB following EU sanctions Friday on the bank. VTB's German subsidiary's operations were ""unchanged"" and clients could continue to access deposits, German regulators said.

VTB was already hit by US sanctions and has been cut from the international SWIFT banking system. The German-registered subsidiary has been banned from transferring funds to ""VTB group entities"" already for ""several weeks,"" Germany's financial regulator said.

Russian forces stole radioactive substances from Chernobyl

Ukraine's state agency for managing the Chernobyl exclusion zone said Russian forces that occupied the Chernobyl nuclear plant for five weeks stole radioactive substances from research laboratories. Ukraine said some of those substances were lethal.

From February 24 until March 31 Russian forces occupied the plant, site of the devastating 1986 nuclear accident, the world's worst such incident.

On Facebook, Ukraine said two research facilities in the area were pillaged. They said Russian forces stole 133 highly radioactive substances.

Earlier in the week, Ukraine's energy minister German Gulashchenko said Russian forces that had occupied the site were exposed to ""shocking"" amounts of radiation, adding some may have less than one year to live as a result.

However, experts told DW that the radiological dangers had been vastly overstated.

""Russia's departure from northern Ukraine leaves evidence of the disproportionate targeting of non-combatants including the presence of mass graves, the fatal use of hostages as human shields, and mining of civilian infrastructure,"" the MOD said in its latest intelligence update.

British military intelligence also claimed Russian forces continue to use improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in Ukraine.

According to the statement, IEDs were being used to ""inflict casualties, lower morale, and restrict Ukrainian freedom of movement.""

As a reminder, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that those guilty of killing civilians in the Ukrainian city of Bucha were guilty of war crimes and should be brought to justice.

Scholz also said that the Bundeswehr was helping Ukraine with weapons from its own stocks. He assured that Berlin would continue to support Kyiv.

Meanwhile, it became known that Ukraine intends to buy German Marder infantry fighting vehicles directly from the manufacturer Rheinmetall. This was reported by Bild.

According to the newspaper, the company plans to deliver 35 armored vehicles by the end of the year.

It is also reported that Rheinmetall originally offered 100 decommissioned Marder armored vehicles, which had been parked at the company's site for years. Since they need to be repaired first, the company proposed an exchange: the Bundeswehr would immediately deliver ready-to-use BMPs to Ukraine and then receive the repaired ones from Rheinmetall.

The German Defense Ministry refused, stating that the Bundeswehr itself needs armored vehicles both on the eastern flank of NATO (141 Marder) and for training and exercises (about 100 Marder).

However, according to Bild, the Defense Ministry has not even inspected the BMPs to assess their condition and the need for repairs and maintenance.

Ukrainian Ambassador Andrei Melnik criticized such behavior of the ministry: ""If it is true that the ministry has not inspected them yet, it is a scandal.

Zelenskyy has called for an embargo on imported gas and oil from Russia, but Germany so far resisted pressure to do so.

Scholz said on Friday that Germany could end Russian oil imports this year but stopping gas imports would be tougher because the country would need to build infrastructure to import gas from alternative sources.

Russian oil accounts for 25% of German imports, down from 35% before the Feb. 24 invasion. Gas imports to Germany from Russia have been cut to 40% from 55%, and hard coal imports to 25% from 50%.

Separately, Zelenskyy’s office said in a statement the president had held a conference call with Ukrainian officials during which Kyiv’s proposals for a sixth package of European Union sanctions had been developed.

War crimes

A statement from Scholz’s office on the chancellor’s call with Zelenskyy did not mention a discussion of sanctions, saying Zelenskyy had informed Scholz of “the current situation and negotiations between Ukraine and Russia”.

Scholz’s office said the chancellor condemned what he said were war crimes by Russia’s military in Bucha and other parts of Ukraine on the call and that the German government would ensure perpetrators were identified and brought before national and international courts.

Moscow has rejected allegations by Ukraine and Western nations of war crimes. It denies targeting civilians during what the Kremlin calls a “special military operation” to demilitarize and “denazify” its neighbor.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Saturday that Russian forces appeared to have committed war crimes by targeting civilians in Ukraine, but that the matter needed to be investigated by lawyers.

Cleaning crews have arrived at the railway station in Kramatorsk, eastern Ukraine, where dozens of Ukrainians were killed by a Russian missile strike on Friday while waiting to flee fighting.

CNN saw workers wearing plastic gloves gather scattered human remains. Others looked through papers and documents that were strewn across the station. Plastic bags filled with food lay on the ground, alongside shredded hats, gloves and shoes.

Several points of impact from the strike were visible, including what appeared to have been a direct hit on a car. Pools of blood and a deceased dog, partially covered by white sheeting, lay by the tracks.

At least 50 people, including five children, were killed in the attack, Ukrainian officials said Friday, with dozens more taken to local hospitals.

""Today in Kherson a peaceful rally took place in front of the Yubileiny concert hall to commemorate the victims of Russian aggression,"" he said on Facebook. ""As expected, the occupiers dispersed it.""

He added that locals were participating in rallies at ""great risk,"" saying locals faced intimidation and the threat of disappearance.

CNN was not immediately able to verify the rally or its turnout. Ukrainians opposed to Russian occupation have held a series of rallies in cities in southern Ukraine.

The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Sunday said Russians in the town of Nova Kakhovka in Kherson region had used local printing houses to prepare brochures, booklets and posters in preparation for an apparent referendum on the establishment of a so-called ""Kherson People's Republic.""

Separatists in eastern Ukraine held referendums in 2014 on the formation of ""people's republics,"" in voting that was dismissed by Ukraine and Western countries as a sham.

Serhii Khlan, a member of the Kherson regional council, said Russian sympathizers holding Russian tricolor flags had tried to organize a rally in the city of Nova Kakhovka, posting a photo on Facebook that he said showed a very small turnout compared with a pro-Ukrainian rally.

""This is all you need to know about the probability of a Kherson People's Republic in the Kherson region,"" he said. ""This will not happen, because this is Ukraine!""",https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-04-10-22/h_88a19cd7ec4ea982ffe435f8c50101e3
