Die Ukraine soll erstmals ein Ziel in Russland selbst angegriffen haben. Der Sammler am 1. April 2022:

• In der Nacht zum Freitag soll die Ukraine ein russisches Treibstoffdepot angegriffen haben – in Russland selbst. Wenn die bisherigen (nur russischen) Berichte zutreffen, hat das eine neue Qualität, so weit bekannt dürfte es der erste Angriff der Ukraine auf russischem Territorium sein. Eine Bestätigung aus Kiew gibt es allerdings bislang nicht.

Aus der Meldung von Reuters dazu:

Two Ukrainian military helicopters struck a fuel depot in the Russian city of Belgorod on Friday, a Russian official said, making the first accusation of a Ukrainian air strike on Russian soil since Moscow invaded its neighbour in late February.

Video images of the purported attack posted online showed what looked like several missiles being fired from low altitude, followed by an explosion. … The helicopters struck the facility in Belgorod, some 35 kilometres (22 miles) from the border with Ukraine, after entering Russia at low altitude, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on messaging app Telegram.

Es gibt auch Videos, die das belegen sollen:

Wenn es eine ukrainische Bestätigung für diesen Angriff gibt, der den Nachschub der russischen Streitkräfte in der Ukraine weiter erschweren dürfte, wird sie nachgetragen.

• Das britische Intel Update:

Ukrainian forces have retaken the villages of Sloboda and Lukashivka to the south of Chernihiv and located along one of the main supply routes between the city and Kyiv.

Ukraine has also continued to make successful but limited counter attacks to the east and north east of Kyiv.

Both Chernihiv and Kyiv have been subjected to continued air and missile strikes despite Russian claims of reducing activity in these areas.

• Das Morgenbriefing des ukrainischen Generalstabs:

The thirty-seventh day of the heroic resistance of the Ukrainian people to the russian military invasion has began.

The units of the russian occupation forces continue to partially withdraw from the north of Kyiv oblast towards the state border with the republic of belarus. It is noted the movement of joint columns of equipment of different quantity of russian enemy. The convoys also include civilian vehicles (trucks, buses, minibuses, cars) that were stolen by russian invaders during the temporary occupation of the territories. In addition, the enemy carries out the removal of looted property.

In the temporarily occupied territories, the russian enemy continues its illegal actions, restricting the movement of civilians, using the houses and apartments of local residents to accommodate personnel, holding hostages local residents and activists. Marauding and violence against Ukrainian citizens continues.

In some temporarily occupied by the russian enemy areas, the russian occupiers are trying to force entrepreneurs to switch to paying for goods and services in russian rubles.

The Joint Forces of Ukraine repulsed 7 enemy attacks in the Donetsk and Luhansk directions during the day. Ukrainian warriors destroyed 3 tanks, 2 armoured personnel carriers, 2 units of motor vehicles and 2 artillery systems. An Orlan-10 UAV was also shot down.

• Das Morgenbriefing des russischen Verteidigungsministeriums:

Units of the Lugansk People’s Republic, continuing their offensive, blockaded the northern outskirts of Kremennaya and the eastern outskirts of Metelkino. During the night, up to 40 Ukrainian nationalists of 57th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade, 1 artillery battery, 2 IFVs and 4 vehicles of various purposes were destroyed.

High-precision air-based weapons destroyed 6 Ukrainian military facilities, including five ammunition and missile-artillery weapons depots in Boguslavskoe, Krestishe, Reznikov, Velikaya Novoselka and 1 fuel depot.

Air defence means of the Russian Aerospace Forces shot down 1 Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter near Lyubimovka and 8 Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicles near Lisichansk, Donetsk, Chernigov, Korosun and Novomikhailovskoe, including 1 Bayraktar TB-2 near Vakhovka.

Operational-tactical and army aviation hit 52 military assets of Ukraine.

Among them: 3 command posts, 3 multiple launch rocket systems, Buk-M1 anti-aircraft complex, illumination and guidance radar of S-300 anti-aircraft missile system, as well as 10 areas of military equipment concentration and 16 AFU strong points.

In total, 124 aircfaft and 81 helicopters, 353 unmanned aerial vehicles, 1,839 tanks and other armored combat vehicles, 202 multiple launch rocket systems, 773 field artillery and mortars, as well as 1,711 units of special military vehicles of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were destroyed during the operation.

• Eine interessante Frage wird, ob sich an den Waffenlieferungen des Westens zur Unterstützung der Ukraine etwas verändert – nicht im Umfang, aber in der Qualität. Seit längerem und immer drängender fordert die Ukraine auch schwere Waffen, Kampfflugzeuge und Artillerie ohnehin.

Bereits am (gestrigen) Donnerstag hatte eine Geberkonferenz in London offensichtlich die Weichen in diese Richtung gestellt, wie das britische Verteidigungsministerium mitgeteilt hatte:

The international community has committed to widening its package of military support for Ukraine and explored new ways of sustaining the Armed Forces of Ukraine over the longer term, including the provision of increasingly capable air and coastal defence systems, artillery and counter battery capabilities, armoured vehicles and protected mobility, as well as wider training and logistical support.

Dabei stellt sich natürlich sofort die Frage, was increasingly capable air and coastal defence systems konkret bedeuten könnte. Eine Antwort darauf gibt es noch nicht.

Bei den armoured vehicles ist dagegen bereits klar: Australien wird geschützte Truppentransporter des Typs Bushmaster an die Ukraine liefern, wie der australische Premierminister Scott Morrison mitteilte:

Prime Minister Scott Morrison says Australia will fly a number of Australian-made Bushmaster vehicles over to Ukraine, after a public plea from the nation’s wartime President.

„We’re going to be sending our armoured vehicles, our Bushmasters as well, and we’ll be flying them over there on our C-17 [Globemasters].“

Ergänzung: Deutschland hat die Weitergabe von Schützenpanzern der Nationalen Volksarmee (NVA) der DDR an die Ukraine genehmigt. Die Kampffahrzeuge waren ursprünglich an Schweden geliefert und dann an eine tschechische Firma verkauft worden. Eine entsprechende Meldung der Welt (Link aus bekannten Gründen nicht) bestätigte ein Sprecher des Verteidigungsministeriums in Berlin.

Dabei handelt es sich um 56 Panzerkampfwagen PbV-501, ein Upgrade der sowjetischen BMP-1. Die Gefechtsfahrzeuge, Standardausstattung der Streitkräfte des Warschauer Vertrags, waren nach der Übernahme durch die Bundeswehr im Reparaturwerk Neubrandenburg modernisiert und später an Schweden abgegeben worden. Das skandinavische Land verkaufte sie an das Unternehmen in Tschechien weiter. Wie bei Rüstungsexporten üblich, war für die jeweilige Weitergabe eine Exportgenehmigung des Ursprungslandes, also in diesem Falle der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, erforderlich.

Schweden hatte 350 dieser Schützenpanzer modernisieren lassen. 280 davon waren bereits 2015 über den tschechischen Zwischenhändler an den Irak verkauft worden. Nach Angaben der Welt hatte die Bundesregierung einen Verkaufsantrag für die Ukraine noch 2019 abgelehnt.

• Update: Das Abendbriefing des russischen Verteidigungsministeriums erwähnt prominent den Vorfall in Belgorod – für den die Ukraine bislang ausdrücklich keine Verantwortung übernahm:

On 1 April, at around 5am Moscow time, two Ukrainian Mi-24 helicopters entered Russian airspace at an extremely low altitude.

Manoeuvring to advantage of terrain folds, Ukrainian helicopters launched a missile attack on a civilian oil storage facility on the outskirts of Belgorod.

As a result of the hits, some of the tanks were damaged and ignited.

I would like to stress that only civilian vehicles were supplied with fuel from this facility. The oil depot has no relation to the Russian Armed Forces.

The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation continue the special military operation in Ukraine.

Units of the Russian Armed Forces have completed the mopping-up of Urozhainoe from nationalists and are fighting with the Ukrainian 54th Separate Mechanized Brigade for the capture of Oktyabr state farm.

The advance during the day was 8 kilometers. A Ukrainian motorised infantry company, reinforced by a tank platoon, is destroyed.

Onyx high-precision cruise missiles of Bastion coastal missile system have destroyed the headquarters of a group of Ukrainian troops near Shakhterskoe. Up to 40 personnel, 5 armoured vehicles and vehicles of various purposes were destroyed.

During the day, operational-tactical and army aviation hit 40 military assets of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

Among them: 2 anti-aircraft missile systems, including 1 Buk-M1 system near Murakhovo and 1 Osa launcher near Velikie Novoselki, as well as 32 areas of concentration of Ukrainian weapons and military equipment.

Russian air defence means have shot down 1 Ukrainian Mi-24 helicopter near Gulyai Pole and 4 Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicles near Novomikhailovka, Izyum and Kharkov.

In total, 124 aircfaft and 82 helicopters, 357 unmanned aerial vehicles, 1,854 tanks and other armored combat vehicles, 202 multiple launch rocket systems, 777 field artillery and mortars, as well as 1,722 units of special military vehicles of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were destroyed during the operation.

• Das Abendbriefing des ukrainischen Generalstabs (auf 1800 Uhr ukrainischer Zeit terminiert, aber erst in der Nacht veröffentlicht):

The russian federation continues to conduct full-scale armed aggression against Ukraine. The withdrawal of separate units from the territory of Kyiv and Chernihiv oblasts continues, as well as the regrouping of enemy troops, presumably to create strike groups in the Slobozhansky and Donetsk directions.

According to available information, in the territory of the republic of belarus, in the Gomel Republican Scientific and Practical Center for Radiation Medicine and Human Ecology, allegedly „wounded“ servicemen of the Armed Forces of the russian federation who received significant doses of radiation during their stay in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.

In the territories of the Zaporizhzhia region temporarily occupied by the russian occupiers, in the city of Enerhodar, on the territory of the military unit of the National Guard of Ukraine, the russian occupiers continue to detain local residents. They are suspected of organizing pro-Ukrainian actions and preparing sabotage against the russian invaders. Employees of the Federal Security Service of the russian federation are interrogating them using psychological and physical pressure.

According to available information, the so-called referendum is planned for April 4 in the city of Tokmak by the russian occupiers. In particular, the occupation administration has already notified the local population about this event.

The city of Melitopol is temporarily controlled by the military and the enemy’s rosguard. The russian enemy continues to place artillery systems among the residential quarters, from which it fires in the Zaporizhzhia direction.

The russian occupiers do not give up the idea of introducing the educational process in educational institutions according to their own standards and in russian in April 2022.

Educators who agree to teach subjects are promised a monetary reward. Also, the russian occupiers continue to try to distribute so-called „humanitarian aid“ to local residents. At the same time, they appropriate Ukrainian humanitarian aid coming from the city of Zaporizhia.

In the temporarily occupied by the russian enemy settlement Shchastia Luhansk oblast, all attempts by the russian occupiers to restore the thermal power plant, which suffered significant damage as a result of hostilities, were in vain, because qualified specialists left the village.

In Stanytsa Luhanskaya, russian invaders are conducting propaganda activities. In particular, employees of the occupation administration work with low-income families registered with social services and distribute so-called „humanitarian aid“.

When leaving the city of Bucha, the russian occupation forces mined civilian buildings, infrastructure and areas within the settlement.",https://augengeradeaus.net/2022/04/ukraine-russland-nato-der-sammler-am-1-april/comment-page-1/

SouthFront – The main military developments of the last days of fighting in Ukraine were the partial withdrawal of Russian troops from the Kiev and Chernihiv regions and their advance in the East of the country, taking full control of the strategically important town of Izyum in the Kharkiv region.

In the Kiev region, in the North-Western direction from the capital, the AFU took control of several towns, where fierce fighting continued for weeks. The Kiev grouping of the Ukrainian Armed Forces confirmed control over the cities of Borodyanka, Bucha, Vorzen, Gostomel, and Ivankov.

The Ukrainian Armed Forces unblocked the Kiev-Zhytomyr highway as well.

The main front line in the north-West of the capital probably remains in the Gostomel-Bucha-Oziora area. On April 1, the Russian MoD reported that airborne and marine units of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation took full control of the five-kilometers long territory from the Irpen river towards Kiev.

” Units of the Russian airborne troops in cooperation with marines during a special military operation in Ukraine have successfully deterred enemy forces in the Gostomel-Bucha-Oziora area for five days. As a result, the marines were able to take full control of the territory from the Irpen river towards Kiev with a total length of five kilometers.” – the report reads.

To the east of Kiev, the front line has moved about 130 km away from the Ukrainian capital and now lies near the city of Priluki in the Chernihiv region.

The decision to reduce its military operations in the Kiev region was presented by the Russian side as a concession to Kiev aimed at the facilitation of the negotiation process between the two sides. The main goal of reducing the Russian military contingent in the Kiev and Chernihiv regions is certainly the strengthening of the Russian and L/DPR groupings in the Donbas region.

The decision to partially withdraw from the Kiev region is also due to the difficulties faced by Russian forces near the Ukrainian capital.

Russian troops suffered significant difficulties with logistics in this region. Russian soldiers stayed in field conditions for weeks and had no opportunity to gain a foothold in the heavily destroyed towns in the suburbs of the capital after the fighting.

All supplies were carried out from the territory of Belarus, through the Chernobyl region, which is located hundreds of kilometers from the front lines. Ivankov was the main supply point of the Russian grouping to the west of Kiev. The advance of the Russian troops faced stiff resistance from the AFU, significant losses were suffered.

Since most of the bridges across the Dnieper River were destroyed or were located in the deep rear in the north, there were almost no communications established between Russian groupings on different banks of the Dnieper River.

In the east of the capital, logistic supplies also affected Russian warfare. Russian troops established control over the Kiev-Sumy highway for hundreds of kilometers but nearby areas were not secured. Russian columns were regularly subjected to flank attacks.

Hours after the Russian Ministry of Defence proclaimed the partial withdrawal of Russian troops from the Kiev region, the capital faced the most fierce artillery fire exchange. The AFU shelled Russian forces when they were leaving, and Russian artillery returned fire. As a result, civilians who remained in these areas suffered.

Russian military columns are spotted heading toward Eastern Ukraine. Both sides are reinforcing their positions in Eastern Ukraine. So far, the situation on the front lines remains almost unchanged, except some minor changes in the hotspots. Positional clashes continue.

the Kharkiv region clashes continue near the city of Kharkiv, where one of the hotspots is the area of Soltovki.

The governor of the Sumy region said that Russian troops have begun to strengthen control over the territory of the region.

In recent days, the strategic success achieved by the Russian forces was the securing of the town of Izyum, where fierce fighting continued for several weeks, especially in the southern part of the town. Russian servicemen delivered humanitarian aid to the town of Izyum for the first time since the beginning of the Russian special military operation. Accompanied by the Military Police of the Russian Armed Forces, the humanitarian aid included more than 45 tonnes of supplies.

Russian strikes with missiles from the 9K720 Iskander-M missile system on the fortification of the Ukrainian army in the vicinity of Izyum in the Kharkiv region:

In the south of the Kharkiv region, according to some local reports, the AFU are strengthening their positions near Barvenkovo, southwest of Izyum. The village is one of the potential directions of the Russian advance in the region, along with Slavyansk and Lozova to the southeast.

Earlier, clashes were reported near the village of Gusarovka located between Izyum and Barvenkovo. The village is under AFU control.

On the Donbass front lines, fierce fighting between the units of the armed forces of the Donetsk People’s Republic and the AFU continues in the town of Novobakhmutovka to the north of Avdiivka. Units of the Ukrainian 25th Separate Airborne Brigade are slowly retreating. During the night, up to 40 Nationalists, a tank platoon, and 2 motorized infantry platoons, as well as a mortar battery, were destroyed in this area, according to the Russian Ministry of Defence. DPR forces control most of the territory.

In the town of Avdiivka, the AFU take their time to reinforce their positions, preparing for defense.

About 35% of the territory of the town of Maryinka was reportedly taken under the DPR control days after the street fighting broke out in the town. One of the most heavily fortified positions was established in the area.

Fierce clashes continue near Popasna. No advances were reported by any side.

In the city of Mariupol, some strategic advances were claimed by the DPR. Nationalist forces were divided into three smaller groupings. The main stronghold of the Azov regiment was reportedly blockaded. The two other centers of resistance are the city central region and the city port located to the west of Azovstal and which was cut off by the joint Russian, DPR forces. The major assault of Azovstal may be launched in the coming days, if not on April 2.On April 1, the head of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, gave the Azov fighters one day to surrender.

The front lines in the southern regions of Ukraine are not calm.

On April 1, units of the Russian Armed Forces have completed the mopping-up of Urozhainoe from nationalists and are fighting with the Ukrainian 54th Separate Mechanized Brigade for the capture of Oktyabr state farm.

Onyx high-precision cruise missiles of Bastion coastal missile system have destroyed the headquarters of a group of Ukrainian troops near Shakhterskoe. Up to 40 personnel, 5 armored vehicles, and vehicles of various purposes were destroyed.

The main resistance of the AFU to Russian forces is provided on the borders of the Mykolaiv and Kherson regions. So far, with no significant successes.

The Russian units are reinforcing their positions near the town of Mykolaiv. It was reported that the AFU was amassing in the area of Dneprovskiy Liman to the south of Mykolaiv, near the city of Kherson.

Russian forces took control over the village of Alexandrovka in the area. So far, no fierce clashes were reported in the region, the AFU offensive is likely yet to come.

In the Kherson region, the security operations of Russian forces continue. The Russian military demilitarized the headquarters of the territorial defense of Ukraine in one of the schools in the Kherson region.

Meanwhile, Russian missiles continue the destruction of military facilities in Ukraine.

Early on April 2, high-precision long-range air-based and sea-based weapons destroyed gasoline and diesel fuel storages at the Kremenchuk oil refinery, from which Ukrainian troops in central and eastern parts of the country had been supplied.

The Kremenchuk oil refinery was claimed to be the last large refinery in Ukraine, which processed about 18 million tons of oil per year.

Another large Shebelinsky oil refinery is located near Kharkiv. It was stopped on February 26 because of the fighting. However, it was not destroyed, so the work there may resume soon. The capacity of the Shebelensky refinery is only 1 million tons of fuel per year.

High-precision air-based missiles have disabled military airfields in Poltava and Dnepropetrovsk. It is reported that at least 4 missiles hit at the airfield and part of the air defense in Poltava.

According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, Russian air defense means have shot down two Ukrainian Mi-24 helicopters near Sumy and Urozhainoe.

On April 1, it was claimed that Russian air defense means have shot down 1 Ukrainian Mi-24 helicopter near Gulyai Pole and 4 Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicles near Novomikhailovka, Izyum, and Kharkov.

On 1 April, at around 5am Moscow time, two Ukrainian Mi-24 helicopters entered Russian airspace at an extremely low altitude. Maneuvering to the advantage of terrain folds, Ukrainian helicopters launched a missile attack on a civilian oil storage facility on the outskirts of Belgorod. As a result of the hits, some of the tanks were damaged and ignited.

Only civilian vehicles were supplied with fuel from this facility. The oil depot has no relation to the Russian Armed Forces.

Strikes of the AFU on the civilian areas in the Belgorod region were silenced by the Russian Ministry of Defence and the media. No casualties or damage were reported.

On April 1, an exchange of prisoners took place in the Zaporozhye region. 86 servicemen, including 15 female servicemen, were returned to the Ukrainian side. The number of prisoners returned to the Russian side is unknown.
