Now I'm in my apartment, but we sounded sirens all night and we were sitting in bomb shelters, today the Russians dropped bombs on our city again, several dozen people were injured and several died, people are buried in the backyards of their homes, it's very awful in relation to ordinary civilians. You can probably see this in the news. Yesterday in Irpin near Kyiv, terrorists killed a journalist from the United States who worked and showed the truth to the New York Times. Two more of his comrades were injured and are currently in hospital in Kyiv. Crypto worms is my own NFT project that I started creating six months ago. Most of the NFT from it was sold in the beginning and now people are just trading it. The game itself is for 2 people who play in battle with each other with different skills and weapons (the game is still under development.) These are people who trade NFT for resale and people who want to wait for the release of a game where they can reproduce their NFT to treat others, receive crypto tokens worms and health elixirs. Crypto game is not just a game, you can play it and earn more. 5. pUtin is a small man who is not friendly with the head and creates big problems for the whole world, Ukraine suffers the most in this confrontational people are losing their homes. The city of Mariupol, where 500,000 people lived, has been wiped off the face of the earth. It is scary to look at it. Now everyone is helping the country as best they can, some are volunteering to prepare food for soldiers and refugees, some are defending our land and their city with a machine gun. I, in turn, joined the funds and decided to make a charity project for people who lost their homes and to support our army, our army is many times smaller than the Russian, but our people are much smarter. Pictures for the NFT project are ready now I am working with NFT crypto markets where we will be added. The project already has the name Strong Ukraine. Each picture of the project is unique and reflects the strength of spirit of the people. The NFT theme has been popular for a year now. I also successfully trade various collections and help with creation. Now there are a lot of videos on YouTube to create a collection in different languages, everyone can understand this. Or write to me if you want to trade or create your own collections, I can help if I am interested in the project. I have 50 unique pictures and the time provided is no longer needed as my collection is created in one style and other creators will find it difficult to understand my style. Now there is a greater need for advertising the project on a large scale not only in Ukraine but around the world. We now buy a lot of helmets and body armor, as well as night vision devices and thermal imagers. All this is needed. Now our volunteers bring us money, we buy it with money donated by people and add our own when needed. To say what you can help us need to understand what country you are from and how you can help. It is a financial aid whether you can buy the things we need and transfer or accept women with children. Sites such as solsea and solanart help in the quick verification procedure, and I will ask them to post on the main page and on social networks as much as possible. The Crypto worms project has nothing to do with the Strong Ukraine charity project, these are different projects. Soon we will win over and return our territories, and all the partners who supported us and the people who helped financially and in all other ways will celebrate our common victory. Glory to Ukraine!",https://anchor.fm/irish-tech-news/episodes/The-worlds-largest-anti-food-waste-app--Too-Good-To-Go--insights-with-Jamie-Crummie-e1f7sso
