""We are witnessing what could become the largest humanitarian crisis on our European continent in many, many years,"" Janez Lenarcic told a media conference after a meeting of EU interior ministers focused on the flow of refugees from Ukraine.

""Currently, the expected number of displaced Ukrainians is over seven million people,"" he said, but cautioned he was giving only ""rough estimates"" from the UN because fighting prevented accurate counting.

A European Commission official later clarified that Lenarcic was giving ""estimations in case the aggression continues"", based on UN information.

Lenarcic said that, according to the UN, if the war continued, ""there will be around 18 million Ukrainians that will be affected in humanitarian terms, be it in Ukraine proper, or in the neighbouring countries"".

Lenarcic said that ""the figures are big and we will have to prepare for this kind of emergency, which is of historical proportions"".

According to the latest situation report from the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), issued late on Saturday, ""more than 160,000 people have reportedly been internally displaced"".

""Over 116,000 have been forced to flee across international borders into neighbouring European countries"" based on UNHCR estimates, OCHA added.

The document said the Ukrainian government estimated that there could be ""as many as five million refugees in worst-case scenario"".

As the Russian offensive enters its fifty-third day, we track where the fighting is happening and how we got here.

Read on for an overview of the situation in infographics and maps.

Who controls what in Ukraine?

Russia says it has “completely cleared” the port city of Mariupol with a small group of holdout fighters on the outskirts told to “surrender to save themselves”. Explosions have been heard in the capital Kyiv. Russia is still redeploying equipment from Belarus towards eastern Ukraine, according to the UK defence ministry.

Where are people fleeing to?

According to the UN refugee agency’s data portal, more than 4.8 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion. Many have sought refuge in Poland and other neighbouring states.

The latest and still growing count had 2,744,778 people entering Poland, 732,473 in Romania, 484,725 in Russia, 454,098 in Hungary, 421,130 in Moldova, 332,707 in Slovakia, and 22,827 in Belarus.

Most of the arrivals have been women and children. All men aged between 18 and 60 have been prevented from leaving Ukraine to stay and fight.

Anti-war protests around the world

Thousands of people have taken to public squares and Russian embassies across the globe to protest against the invasion.

OVD-Info, which has documented crackdowns on Russia’s opposition for years, says more than 5,000 demonstrators have been arrested across Russia since Putin launched the war on Ukraine.

The map and list below show the locations where sizeable protests have occurred. More protests are planned in the coming days across cities worldwide.

World cities where protests have taken place:

Adana; Amsterdam; Antwerp; Athens; Atlanta; Austin; Baku; Bangkok; Barcelona; Bari; Beirut; Berdiansk; Berlin; Bern; Bloomington; Bordeaux; Boston; Brighton; Brussels; Budapest; Buenos Aires; Caernarfon; Cambridge; Cape Town; Chicago; Colombo; Copenhagen; Curitiba; Denver; Dublin; Edinburgh; Exeter; Frankfurt; Geneva; Glasgow; Guayaquil; Helsinki; Houston; Istanbul; Krakow; Kuala Lumpur; Lahore; London; Lisbon; Madrid; Malmo; Manchester; Manila; Marseille; Melbourne; Mexico City; Milan; Milwaukee; Minneapolis; Minsk; Montclair; Montpellier; Montreal; Munich; Naples; Newcastle; New Delhi; New York City; Nice; Norwich; Nottingham; Oslo; Ottawa; Oxford; Paris; Podgorica; Prague; Pretoria; Pristina; Quezon City; Rome; Salerno; San Francisco; Santa Monica; Santiago; Sao Paulo; Seoul; Stockholm; Sydney; Taipei; Tallinn; Tbilisi; Tehran; Tel Aviv; The Hague; Thessaloniki; Tirana; Tokyo; Toronto; Turin; Vancouver; Vienna; Vilnius; Warsaw; Washington, DC; Wellington; Zakopane.

Protests have taken place in at least 50 Russian cities, including Chelyabinsk, Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, Novosibirsk, Perm, Saint Petersburg, Samara, and Yekaterinburg.

Ukraine and Russia explained in ten maps and charts

Below are ten infographics that break down the history, politics and economics of the Ukraine-Russia crisis.

1. Conflict at a glance

After months of tensions and intense diplomacy, Russian forces invaded Ukraine. Explosions were heard across the country. Kyiv declared martial law, saying Ukraine will defend itself. Below is a summary of the conflict at a glance.

2. History of the USSR

Russia and Ukraine were part of the 15 Soviet republics that made up the Soviet Union. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine declared independence on August 24. The map below shows when each of these countries declared independence.

3. Political leadership

After independence, Ukraine moved to shed its Russian imperial legacy and forge increasingly close ties with the West.

Over the past 30 years, Ukraine has been led by seven presidents. The country has had a rocky path towards democracy with two revolutions, first in 2005 and then in 2014. Both times, protesters rejected Russia’s supremacy and sought a path to join the European Union and NATO.

By comparison, Russia has been led by three presidents, with Putin having been in office for 17 years. In 2021, Putin, the former agent of the Soviet Union’s KGB security services, signed a law that essentially enables him to stay in power until 2036.

Putin has repeatedly claimed that Russians and Ukrainians belong to “one people” and are part of the historical “Russian civilisation” that also includes neighbouring Belarus. Ukrainians reject his claims.

4. How big are Ukraine and Russia?

Ukraine has an estimated population of 44 million – the seventh-largest in Europe. The country comprises 24 regions, known as oblasts. The country’s population has declined since the 1990s with fertility rates among the lowest in the world. As of 2020, Ukraine’s fertility rate was just 1.2. For context, in order for a population to remain stable, an overall total fertility rate of 2.1 is required.

Ukraine is the second-largest country in Europe, after Russia. At 603,550sq km (233,031sq miles), Ukraine is a bit smaller than the US state of Texas, about three times smaller than India, half the size of South Africa and about two and a half times the size of the United Kingdom.

5. NATO in Europe

NATO is the world’s most powerful military alliance. Comprising 30 nations, its primary role is to protect its member states by political and military means.

Russia opposes NATO bases near its borders and has asked for written guarantees that NATO will not expand eastwards. One of the Kremlin’s central demands is that Ukraine never be allowed to join NATO – a move it considers a red line. The United States has refused to concede to this demand.

Read more about NATO history and expansion here.

6. Military head to head

Russia has one of the most powerful militaries in the world and ranks among the top five defence spenders.

In 2020, Russia spent $61.7bn on its military, which accounted for 11.4 percent of government spending. In comparison, Ukraine spent $5.9bn on its armed forces, or 8.8 percent of government spending, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

Since tensions began, NATO allies, fearful of a potential ground invasion by Russia, have stepped up support for Kyiv by sending military equipment to Ukraine.

Read more about the military capabilities of Russia and Ukraine here.

7. Oil and gas resources

Russia and Ukraine are both rich in oil and gas. Russia has the world’s highest proven gas reserves at 48,938 billion cubic metres. More than 70 percent of the country’s gas reserves are held by Gazprom, a state-owned energy giant.

Russia supplies about one-third of Europe’s natural gas. US sanctions over the conflict could disrupt that supply, exacerbating Europe’s energy crisis. On February 22, Germany halted the certification of Nord Stream 2, an $11.6bn Russian gas pipeline project that was designed to move 151 million cubic metres of gas a day into Europe.

Russia also has some of the largest proven oil reserves, at 80 billion barrels, or 5 percent of the world’s total.

Ukraine, too, has a sizeable reserve of oil and gas at 395 million barrels and 349 billion cubic metres, respectively. The country sits at the crossroads between the West and Russia, and plays a key role in delivering Russian gas to European markets.

8. Russia and Ukraine’s main exports

More than one-quarter of the world’s wheat exports come from Russia and Ukraine. Economic sanctions or military action may have a significant effect on the cost of food as importers seek to find alternatives. Russia exported $407bn in products and Ukraine $49bn in 2019.

Read more about Russia, Ukraine and the global wheat supply here.

9. Which countries rely most on Russian oil?

In 2019, the world’s top exporters of crude oil were Saudi Arabia ($145bn), Russia ($123bn), Iraq ($73.8bn), Canada ($67.8bn), and the US ($61.9bn).

China bought about one-quarter (27 percent) of Russia’s total oil exports worth $34bn. However, given China’s massive energy needs, this made up only 16 percent of the country’s oil imports.

At least 48 countries imported Russian crude oil in 2019. The countries that rely most on Russian oil include: Belarus, Cuba, Curacao, Kazakhstan, Latvia – each importing more than 99 percent of their crude oil from Russia.

The graphic below shows how much of each country’s total crude oil imports come from Russia.

10. Which countries buy the most Russian weapons?

Russia is the world’s second-largest arms exporter, behind the United States, accounting for roughly 20 percent of global weapons sales. Between 2016 and 2020, Moscow sold $28bn of weapons to 45 countries.

Russia exports nearly 90 percent of its arms to 10 countries. Its biggest customer, India, bought 23 percent of Russia’s weapons for some $6.5bn over the past five years. Half of India’s total arms imports, 49.3 percent, come from Russia.

China is the second-largest buyer of Russian weaponry at $5.1bn over the same period followed by Algeria ($4.2bn), Egypt ($3.3bn), and Vietnam ($1.7bn), according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).

Interview Highlights

On the last two days in western Ukraine

Olga Tokariuk: “Here in the western Ukraine, it's relatively calm, definitely compared to what is happening in central and eastern parts of the country. In Kiev ... in southern Ukraine, that is a part of which is under control now of Russian occupying forces. There are heavy battles going on around Kiev. Also in Kharkiv. Kharkiv has been shelled earlier today by Russian artillery, using cluster munitions causing massive casualties and dozens of casualties. That was done deliberately during the talks between Russia and Ukraine, so Russia is escalating again.

""Well, you know, compared to that, it's relatively safe here. There was an air alert last night. And we had to go in the basement at about midnight local time. It was planned about one hour in the bomb shelter before this air alert was lifted, and we were told that we can go back safely to sleep. And there is a curfew. But as I said, it's nothing in comparison to what is happening around Kharkiv.

""The main issue here is we are having a large influx of internally displaced people coming from those areas that are most affected by the fighting. And currently in the house where I'm staying, also, we are hosting six other people who fled from Kiev, and some more people are about to come today. And almost I think every family now in western Ukraine is sheltering someone. Because there is a massive influx of internally displaced people. And some of them also go further west and southwest towards the border between Ukraine and the EU countries such as Poland, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, so a humanitarian exodus of big proportion.”

On unity within the EU

Naomi O’Leary: “It's been a really momentous weekend. And there's been a striking transformation, I suppose, in the public policy of EU national governments. We're talking about 27 countries. And usually they have different viewpoints on things. But with the invasion of Ukraine, the Russian President Vladimir Putin has achieved almost the opposite of what he wanted. He's not divided, but he's united the European Union. He's caused them to take steps that were once unthinkable. And there's been an outpouring of solidarity for Ukraine.

""And the EU had been ready for this. They had some sanctions ready, but they were rapidly overtaken by events. The public horror at the invasion was such that national leaders began to come under really fierce pressure to do more, to isolate Russia more and to help Ukraine more. And in response to that, over the weekend, we saw a series of really historic shifts in policy. From Germany announcing enormous arms investment, to the EU paying for lethal military aid itself.”

The EU is funding military equipment, including fighter jets, to Ukraine. How much of a difference is that from the EU that we knew in the past?

Naomi O’Leary: “It's astonishing. The agreement was reached incredibly quickly on Sunday. What it is is there have been efforts for years, like you mentioned, for the EU to do more to cooperate on defense. All of its member states have some kind of national defense. And it's been argued for a very long time that if they work together, if they cooperate, they'll be one of the world's biggest military forces. But that cooperation has been very slow in coming. Not much public appetite for military spending, usually. And also the nervousness, I mean, you know, governments are not so sure about whether it's a good idea to sort of club up on it.

""But the major step forward that we saw this weekend is, for the first time, a decision to jointly fund arms for a conflict. 450 million has been set aside for that. The agreement was reached incredibly quickly. It didn't have to be written anew. It was actually a program that had been designed and agreed last year. It's just that it had never been used for lethal aid before, so that was ready. Everyone came on board. There were three countries that traditionally have a neutrality policy, and they were able to opt out of being involved, of their cash going to military aid. But they used what's called constructive abstention. So that means they don't mind other people going ahead and doing it. And that was Ireland, Malta and Austria.

""So the rest of the EU member states clubbed up, and arms have already reached Ukraine. Now, under this program, there's anti-tank systems that have come from the Netherlands, you mentioned fighter jets. That is a separate agreement that is bilateral between, I believe, the countries of Bulgaria and Poland. Bulgaria and Poland happen to have the kind of fighter jets that Ukrainian pilots know how to fly, MiGs. ... But those two governments are supposed to be lending them, making them available. But that's not actually under the joint EU fund. It's actually a separate thing.”

On Zelenskyy's appeal for EU support

Olga Tokariuk: “The EU and NATO membership have been for a long time. Major Ukrainian foreign policy goals and now is the moment to raise these issues again, as the world stands in solidarity in Ukraine. But also, finally starting to understand why Ukraine was pressuring, and was insisting that it needs to join this alliance. This is a moment to put that back on the table. The war is still going on, but we already have to think about the future and how Ukraine will come out of this war. Well, actually here in Ukraine, I would say that we are sure that Ukraine will win.

""The problem is that we don't know what the human cost of it will be. Because it is clear that Russia is willing to impose huge losses and attacking residential areas and stuff like that. ... I hope they will not do what they did in Syria and in other places, but they are showing that they are prepared for that. But despite that, Ukrainians keep their spirits up, and we are absolutely sure now that there could be no further obstacles and delays to Ukraine's accession into the EU.

""And well, I would say personally, also in NATO, this should be on the table. Ukraine has demonstrated that it is a part of the West. There could be no doubts about that. Everything told by Russia before, it is abundantly clear that it is not true. Ukraine doesn't want to be part of Russian sphere of influence. And especially after this war, this argument is just completely discredited. So that would be also kind of something that Ukrainians really deserve.”

On the possibility of Ukraine joining the EU

Naomi O’Leary: “When it would have been really useful for the EU to have done something about moving towards Ukraine's accession to the bloc would have been before the invasion. The situation is that the Ukrainian government is operating from basements under bombardment. Accession to the European Union is a technical, long process with many steps. It's not something that can really go on during the war situation, during an invasion.

""What the declarations that we are hearing now with Ursula von der Leyen, suggesting that the Ukraine belongs in the EU and other comments like that. What those are are statements of political solidarity, [they are] political statements, it doesn't mean like in technical terms about, it doesn't mean much in terms of unofficial accession. That's really something for the future. It was something that would take a very long time. Certainly, this war, at least as so far as it's gone, will have helped public opinion, I think. In terms of helping Western European public opinion to maybe warm again to the idea of admitting more member states. Because in recent years, the whole concept of expanding the EU had become controversial. Because there had been difficult issues with the integration of existing states.”

Is this a more cohesive European Union action than you've seen before?

Tom Nichols “We have seen it before, but not in over 40 years. Putin has made the classic mistake that his Soviet predecessors made, which was over the years he's had a Europe that's been somewhat, I won't say, divided, but disagrees about how to deal with Russia. Mostly interested in just doing business, leaving aside the old grudges and conflict. And through his own stupidity, I mean, he's not a stupid human being, but this is really stupid strategy. Through his own strategic errors, he has united Europe against him, again.

""This happened in the late '70s when the Soviets invaded Afghanistan. Led to the confrontations of the 1980s. It's really remarkable. I mean, some pundit got off a great tweet over the weekend that said Putin had ended Swedish neutrality and German pacifism all in one weekend. Which is, you know, kind of really a remarkable thing to say. And when you have even the Swiss talking about joining, you know, sanctions ... and things like that. I mean, there has to be some sense in Moscow that 30 years of Soviet and Russian diplomacy has now just collapsed in a big heap. Simply because Putin got this crazy idea that he was going to recreate the Soviet space.”

On what might happen next

Tom Nichols: “That's a good observation. That Putin is somebody from the 21st century, really. I mean, history for him stops somewhere around 1985, and the 21st century certainly didn't happen. There are two things. Well, first, I just want to emphasize something Nina just brought up, about being careful about information. This is going to sound odd, but you know, the average consumer, you don't need to know exactly. You're not in the situation room.

""You're not in the Pentagon, you're not at Downing Street. You can wait ... wait until a little time passes to start digesting that news. I think people wanting to know things instantaneously is opening opportunities for the Russians to feed kind of toxic material into the mainstream. What I'll be looking for is whether or not Putin renews the offensive. Because this whole thing has gone bad. He expected to end in four days, and now I want to see if he takes a pause or if he starts it up again.""

U.S. citizens should consider leaving Russia immediately, State Department says The U.S. Embassy in Moscow warned U.S. citizens Sunday that they should consider leaving the country immediately as more countries impose airspace restrictions on Russia. ""An increasing number of airlines are canceling flights into and out of Russia, and numerous countries have closed their airspace to Russian airlines,"" the embassy said in a statement. ""U.S. citizens should consider departing Russia immediately via commercial options still available."" The embassy added that U.S. citizens should have a contingency plan ""that does not rely on U.S. government assistance."" Americans also should monitor local and international media, keep in contact with family and friends, stay alert to their surroundings when in public, review security plans and always carry their passports with current Russian visas, the embassy said. Since January, the State Department has said Americans should not travel to Russia because of ""ongoing tension along the border with Ukraine, the potential for harassment against U.S. citizens, the embassy's limited ability to assist U.S. citizens in Russia, COVID-19 and related entry restrictions, terrorism, harassment by Russian government security officials, and the arbitrary enforcement of local law.""

U.N. Security Council votes to call rare emergency General Assembly session on Ukraine The U.N. Security Council voted Sunday to call a emergency special session of the General Assembly that will take place Monday, a rare move that comes as the U.S. and its allies, including the European Union, crack down on Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. The decision to call the session passed with 11 votes in favor. China, India and the United Arab Emirates abstained, and Russia was the lone vote against the resolution. Because it was a procedural vote, only nine votes were needed for it to pass, and Russia's veto did not apply. ""Russia cannot veto our voices. Russia cannot veto the Ukrainian people. Russia cannot veto the U.N. Charter. Russia cannot and will not veto accountability,"" said Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., calling the vote ""an important step forward"" toward holding Russia responsible for its actions. Thomas-Greenfield, addressing Russia and reports that its forces have targeted civilians in Ukraine, said the ""world is watching."" ""Photographic and video evidence is mounting, and you will be held to account for your actions. We will not let atrocities slide,"" she said. Share this -







International Atomic Energy Agency says no damage after second reported missile strike on waste site Missiles struck a nuclear waste disposal facility in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, but there were no immediate signs of damage or radioactive release, the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, said Sunday. The IAEA said the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine informed the agency that the strike occurred late Saturday or early Sunday local time. The reported strike came less than 24 hours after the Ukrainian government reported an attack on a similar disposal facility near the country’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, the IAEA said. Again, there were no immediate reports of a radioactive release. NBC News was unable to immediately confirm the reports.

The England Football Association also confirmed that it won’t play against Russia in any international fixture. “This includes any potential match at any level of senior, age group or para football,” it said in a statement on Sunday.

Ukraine healthcare minister: 16 children killed so far during Russian invasion Russian forces have killed at least 16 children during their invasion of Ukraine, Healthcare Minister Viktor Liashko said Sunday.

Kyiv mayor proud of citizens’ spirit, anxious about future As Russian troops draw closer to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv’s mayor is filled with pride over his citizens’ spirit yet anxious about how long they can hold out. In an interview with The Associated Press on Sunday, after a grueling night of Russian attacks on the outskirts of the city, Mayor Vitali Klitschko was silent for several seconds when asked if there were plans to evacuate civilians if Russian troops managed to take Kyiv. “We can’t do that, because all ways are blocked,” he finally said, speaking in English. “All ways are blocked and right now we are encircled — everywhere is Russians and we don’t have a way to evacuate the people. And everyone who had plans to evacuate himself already moved.” The AP was not able to immediately verify the mayor’s report that Kyiv was surrounded, and his spokesperson later tweeted that the mayor had misspoken. Klitschko himself later backed away from his earlier assessment, saying on his Telegram channel that “In the evening, Russian Internet publications spread information with reference to me that Kyiv is allegedly surrounded and evacuation of people is impossible. ...

Russian oligarchs to face international sanctions, U.S. official says European leaders are in step with the U.S. over the decision to target assets owned by Russian oligarchs as well as sanctioned companies in retaliation for Putin's invasion of Ukraine, a senior White House official said. The Biden administration plans to launch a transatlantic task force to identify any ""ill-gotten gains"" from elites close to Putin and the Russian government, the official said. This is in addition to severe sanctions placed on Putin's personal assets and the limitations on Russian banks. ""We’ve also sanctioned Russian oligarchs and Putin’s inner circle and their family members, including Putin’s cronies who sit atop Russia’s largest financial institutions and are responsible for providing the resources necessary to support Putin’s further invasion of Ukraine,"" the official said. Russia's central bank said Thursday that it would offer assistance to any banks or businesses facing sanctions, after the ruble plummeted in value against the U.S. dollar. The U.S. and its allies announced Saturday that they would limit Russia's access to SWIFT, a service that facilitates global transactions among thousands of financial institutions. That decision, along with sanctions on Russian banks, Putin, and Putin's inner circle, is designed to tighten the financial straits on Putin's war reserves. Share this -

No reason to doubt reports of Russia's nuclear activation, defense official tells NBC News The U.S. currently has no reason to doubt reports that Putin asked his military’s nuclear deterrent forces to be on alert, a senior defense official told NBC News on Sunday. In a meeting televised on state television on Sunday, Putin said the decision to place the country’s nuclear weapons on increased readiness to launch was in response to “aggressive statements"" from NATO leaders. There's no view yet from U.S. intelligence on how this might play out, according to the defense official. “We believe that this is an unnecessary and escalatory one,"" the official said. Russian forces have faced fierce resistance from Ukrainians since Russia invaded the country overnight Wednesday, while also facing severe sanctions from the U.S. and its allies. It appears that Russia has put roughly two-thirds of its combat power around Ukraine, the official said, but its military seems to be losing momentum. There's no evidence from U.S. intelligence that Russian forces have taken any Ukrainian cities as of yet, and it appears Russia is behind schedule on where it hoped to be with its invasion plans, the official added.

Former USCIS officials call on Biden to give Ukrainians temporary protected status Two former U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service officials are calling on the Biden administration to immediately grant protections to Ukrainians that would allow them to remain in the country without fear of deportation. Emilio Gonzalez, who served as director of USCIS under former President George Bush, and León Rodríguez, who served as the director of USCIS under the Obama administration, told NBC News on Sunday that they have written a letter to President Joe Biden asking him to grant Temporary Protected Status to Ukrainians in the U.S., which they plan to send in the coming days. ""It's just something very pressing and something that I feel very strongly about,"" said Gonzalez, in a phone interview. ""I did when I was the USCIS director, and I do now [feel] that some people through no fault of their own need protection and if they find themselves in the greatest country in the world at that point in their lives, we should extend that protection."" Under U.S. immigration laws, the secretary of the Homeland Security is authorized to offer TPS to immigrants living in the country if it is determined that their home countries are unable to safely accept deportees due to armed conflict, natural disasters, an epidemic or other ""extraordinary"" emergencies. Asked whether the U.S. was considering extending TPS to Ukrainians, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday it would be a decision for the DHS to make. ""TPS is always on the table when you have a major military crisis that causes the level of displacement that this one has caused,"" said Rodríguez in a phone interview, noting that the status had previously been granted for other nations, including Syria and Venezuela. ""So there's nothing different really about Ukraine in my mind."" ""It is my sincere hope that people will be able to return to Ukraine soon, but right now, there's no question that it is not a place to which people can return safely,"" he added.

Russia suspends space launches from French Guiana in response to sanctions Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, is halting all launches of its Soyuz rocket from Europe's spaceport in South America over sanctions imposed by the European Union. ""In response to EU sanctions against our enterprises, Roscosmos is suspending cooperation with European partners"" on space launches from Europe's spaceport in French Guiana, Roscosmos chief Dmitry Rogozin said in a statement posted Saturday on Twitter, according to a translation.

U.S. and allies applying 'Iran model' to Russia with SWIFT restrictions, official says A senior Biden administration official has described the decision by the United States and some of its allies to remove select Russian banks from the SWIFT messaging system as applying “the Iran model.” Banks kicked off of SWIFT will have to “use a telephone or a fax machine” to send money internationally, helping to turn Russia into “a global economic and financial pariah,” the official who spoke on condition of anonymity told reporters. The U.S. and its allies will “hunt down” the “yachts, jets, fancy cars and luxury homes” of sanctioned Russian companies and oligarchs, they said. On Saturday, the U.S. along with the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Canada announced that select Russian banks would be removed from the service that facilitates global transactions among thousands of financial institutions. The option had been on the table, but some allies in Europe with economies more closely tied to Russia's had been reluctant to include SWIFT among sanctions because of the possible impact it could have.

Zelenskyy urges foreigners to join Ukrainian resistance to Russia's invasion Ukraine's embattled President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has appealed to people across the world to join the resistance against Russia's invasion and enlist in Ukraine's armed forces. ""Anyone who wants to join the defense of Ukraine, Europe and the world can come and fight side by side with the Ukrainians against the Russian war criminals,"" he said a statement on the government website just after 8 a.m. local time (1 a.m. ET). Zelenskyy accused Russia of ""using very vile tactics with all elements of war crimes under Geneva 1949 Convention,"" including killing civilians. ""This is not just Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This is the beginning of a war against Europe, against European structures, against democracy, against basic human rights, against a global order of law, rules and peaceful coexistence,"" he said. He invited foreigners to join an international territorial defense legion, and said anyone could contact the defense attaché at the Ukrainian embassy in their country for more details. Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, echoed the president's call and added in a tweet: ""Together we defeated Hitler, and we will defeat Putin, too."" Foreigners willing to defend Ukraine and world order as part of the International Legion of Territorial Defense of Ukraine, I invite you to contact foreign diplomatic missions of Ukraine in your respective countries.

Ukraine rejects Belarus as location for talks Ukraine’s president said on Sunday that his country was ready for peace talks with Russia but not in Belarus, which was a staging ground for Moscow’s 3-day-old invasion. Speaking in a video message Sunday, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy named Warsaw, Bratislava, Istanbul, Budapest or Baku as alternative venues. He said other locations are also possible but made clear that Ukraine doesn’t accept Russia’s selection of Belarus. The Kremlin said Sunday that a Russian delegation had arrived in the Belarusian city of Homel for talks with Ukrainian officials. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the delegation includes military officials and diplomats. “The Russian delegation is ready for talks, and we are now waiting for the Ukrainians,” Peskov said. Russia invaded Ukraine on Thursday, with troops moving from Moscow’s ally Belarus in the north, and also from the east and south. Share this -

Russian troops take Ukrainian city home to hydroelectric power plant, mayor says Nova Kakhovka, a city in southern Ukraine home to a strategic hydroelectric power plant, is in the hands of Russian forces, Mayor Volodymyr Kovalenko said Sunday. ""Nova Kakhovka in the Kherson Oblast is completely under the control of Russian troops, they seized the city executive committee, removed all Ukrainian flags from buildings,"" Kovalenko said in a statement on Telegram, according to an NBC News translation. It was unclear if Russian forces had taken control of the power plant. The Kherson region, which borders Crimea, was once served by a canal that brought water from the Dnieper River, which also churns electricity at the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station. In 2017, Ukraine built a dam that blocked the canal's supply of water from the river to Crimea. Invading Russian troops have already destroyed the dam in the Kherson region, Reuters reported, allowing for the water to flow freely to the occupied peninsula. Share this -

Ukraine's minister of defense, Oleksiy Reznikov, said early Sunday that forces fending off the Russian offensive in Kyiv have made history. ""Three days changed our country and the world forever,"" he said on Facebook. ""I see a heroic army, a civil guard, fearless border guards, selfless rescuers, reliable police officers, tireless medical angels,"" Reznikov said on Facebook.

Google blocks state-owned media outlet, other Russian channels from earning ad dollars Alphabet Inc's Google on Saturday barred Russia's state-owned media outlet RT and other channels from receiving money for ads on their websites, apps and YouTube videos, similar to a move by Facebook after the invasion of Ukraine. Citing ""extraordinary circumstances,"" Google's YouTube unit said it was ""pausing a number of channels’ ability to monetize on YouTube."" These included several Russian channels affiliated with recent sanctions, such as those by the European Union. Google is also barring Russian state-funded media outlets from using its ad technology to generate revenue on their own websites and apps. In addition, the Russian media will not be able to buy ads through Google Tools or place ads on Google services such as search and Gmail, spokesman Michael Aciman said. ""We’re actively monitoring new developments and will take further steps if necessary,"" Aciman said. Videos from affected media will also come up less often in recommendations, YouTube spokesperson Farshad Shadloo said. He added that RT and several other channels would no longer be accessible in Ukraine after a Ukrainian government request. Russia received an estimated $7 million to $32 million over the two years to December 2018 from ads across 26 YouTube channels it backed, digital researcher Omelas told Reuters at the time. YouTube has previously said it did not treat state-funded media channels that comply with its rules differently from others when it comes to sharing ad revenue. Share this -

Ukrainian former tennis star Sergiy Stakhovsky enlists in reserve army Ukrainian former tennis player Sergiy Stakhovsky enlisted in his country's reserve army last week prior to Russia's invasion, he said, despite a lack of military experience, although he can handle a gun. The 36-year-old Stakhovsky, who won four ATP titles and had a shock win over Roger Federer in the second round of Wimbledon in 2013, said on Saturday he was willing to take up arms in Ukraine's defense. ""Of course, I would fight, it's the only reason I'm trying to get back,"" Stakhovsky told Sky News. ""I signed up for the reserves last week.

Radioactive waste site struck by Russian munitions Russian munitions struck a radioactive waste site in Kyiv, prompting some concern that the effects won't be known until the shelling and missile fire stops, government officials in Ukraine said Sunday. The State Inspectorate for Nuclear Regulation of Ukraine said in a statement that the capital branch of the government Radon Association reported seeing falling missiles on security cameras. ""It is currently not possible to assess the extent of the destruction,"" the state office said, according to a translation of its statement. Experts from the Ukrainian State Association Radon, or Radon Association, reported the attack by phone after seeing it via security video, the inspectorate said. They had taken shelter and viewed the offensive via a remote video system intended for security, it said. The site's automated reporting system had failed. Now those personnel are pinned down until the offensive at their location ends, the inspectorate said. Assessment will happen in the wake of Russia's mission, it said. At the same time, the inspectorate believes there is no radioactive threat to people outside of a buffer zone intended to protect communities from radioactive waste sites. Ukraine has more than a half dozen of these regional sites, including the Kyiv SISP, for State Interregional Specialized Plants for Radioactive Waste Management. They were built to accept waste from the use of radiation in medicine, science and ""different industries,"" according to the government. Share this -

California-based app Premise battles accusations of helping Russian military Premise, a San Francisco-based tech company that pays users around the world to share market research and intelligence information with companies and governments, said it suspended its activities in Ukraine on Friday “out of an abundance of caution” after Ukrainian officials accused it of assisting Russia. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine alleged in a Facebook post that enemies were using Premise’s smartphone app to collect data in the western city of Stryi and other parts of the country for the Kremlin. Premise CEO Maury Blackman said in a statement on Friday that the accusations were “unequivocally false” and that the company does not work for the Russian military or government. “Our company and our team worldwide strongly support Ukraine and the Ukrainian people defending themselves against this illegal act of aggression by Russia,” he said. Premise did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a separate news release also published on Friday, Blackman said that “the public statement of the Ukraine Defense Ministry that has gotten circulation is incorrect.” Read more here.

China so far not helping Russia evade sanctions, U.S. official says WASHINGTON — China so far does not appear to be helping Russia evade Western financial sanctions on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine, but doing so would ""do profound damage"" to China's reputation, a senior Biden Administration official said on Saturday. ""The latest signs suggest that China's not coming to the rescue,"" the official told reporters after announcing that the United States and its allies agreed to impose sanctions against Russia's central bank and disconnect key Russian banks from the SWIFT international financial transaction network. The official said that recent reports that some Chinese banks have stopped issuing letters of credit for purchases of physical commodities from Russia were a positive sign. This ""suggests that, much like has been the pattern for years and years, China has tended to respect the force of U.S. sanctions,"" the official added. China is Russia's biggest trade partner for both exports and imports, buying a third of Russia's crude oil exports in 2020 and supplying it with manufactured products from cell phones and computers to toys and clothing.

Kyiv children's hospital says it's undamaged, 6-year-old caught in nearby attack dead An official at a Kyiv children's hospital allegedly damaged by Russian forces Saturday says it remained intact despite nearby fighting, though a child brought to the hospital had died. Three adults and three children were brought to the Ukraine National Specialized Children’s Hospital, called Okhmadyt, after getting caught in a nearby attack, the hospital's press manager, Anastasia Maggeramova, said over the phone. One six-year-old boy was dead when he arrived at the medical facility. “We heard an attack and after that some people came in by emergency vehicle,"" she said, adding that they were treating the three adults and two children who had survived. ""Now a child is dead because of [the] massive attack.” Maggeramova said the hospital staff had frequently heard nearby conflict over the past few days, though it had not yet reached the medical facility. This is the most patients they'd yet received because of the conflict, she said. “Our doctors have tried to do their best to save them and to help them,” Maggeramova said. Local reports had said Saturday that the hospital, which specializes in treating children with cancer, had been hit by Russian artillery fire and killed one child. Though they remained safe so far, Maggeramova said the staff wanted people to know what was happening. “We want the world to know the truth: civilian people are under attack,"" she said. ""Children are suffering, people are suffering because of war, because of attacks, because of terrible things now happening here in Ukraine.” Share this -







Trump boasts as Russian attack continues; blames Biden, not Putin ORLANDO — Former President Donald Trump test drove a new message on Ukraine Saturday night that immediately won approval from his base. ""I stand as the only president of the 21st century on whose watch Russia did not invade another country,"" he said to applause at the Conservative Political Action Conference here. Russia launched attacks into Georgia during President George W. Bush's administration, Crimea during President Barack Obama's administration and into Ukraine just a few days ago. In a break with traditional decorum from a former president — but in line with Trump's approach to his successor — he placed more blame for the invasion on President Joe Biden, rather than on Russian autocrat Vladimir Putin. ""The problem is not that Putin is smart,"" Trump said. ""The problem is our leaders are dumb — so dumb."" While he called the attack on Ukraine ""an assault on humanity,"" he declined to criticize Putin for launching it. ""If you take over Ukraine, we’re going to sanction you, they say,"" Trump said of the western alliance. ""Sanction, well that’s a pretty weak statement."" Share this -







At least 240 civilian causalities in Ukraine, U.N. says GENEVA — The United Nations says it has confirmed at least 240 civilian casualties, including at least 64 people killed, in the fighting in Ukraine that erupted since Russia’s invasion — though it believed the “real figures are considerably higher” because many reports of casualties remain to be confirmed. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs relayed the count late Saturday from the U.N. human rights office, which has strict methodologies and verification procedures about the toll from conflict. OCHA also said damage to civilian infrastructure has deprived hundreds of thousands of people of access to electricity or water and produced a map of “humanitarian situations” in Ukraine — mostly in northern, eastern and southern Ukraine. The human rights office had reported early Friday an initial count by its staffers of at least 127 civilian casualties – 25 people killed and 102 injured – mostly from shelling and airstrikes.

What happens after removal from SWIFT? Phone or fax, U.S. official says Banks removed from SWIFT banking system would have to ""use a telephone or a fax machine"" to send money internationally, a senior Biden administration official said. The U.S. and its allies on Saturday announced an agreement in which they ""commit to ensuring that selected Russian banks are removed from the SWIFT messaging system"" as punishment for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Which banks have not been determined, but the administration official said that those already under U.S. and European Union sanctions would be considered first. ""If one of these 'de-SWIFT-ed' Russian banks wants to make, or receive, a payment with a bank outside of Russia, such as a bank in Asia, it will now need to use the telephone or a fax machine,"" the administration official said on condition of anonymity. ""In all likelihood, most banks around the world will simply stop transacting altogether with Russian banks that are removed from SWIFT,"" the official said. SWIFT is an industry-owned cooperative headquartered in Belgium. The U.S. official said that the list of banks that could be removed would be finalized by the EU. Share this -







French president asks Belarus counterpart to order removal of Russian soldiers PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron has asked his Belarus counterpart to demand that the country, Ukraine’s neighbor, quickly order Russian troops to leave, claiming Moscow has been given the green light to deploy nuclear arms there. In a phone conversation Saturday, Macron denounced “the gravity of a decision that would authorize Russia to deploy nuclear arms on Belarus soil,” a statement by the presidential palace said. Macron told Alexander Lukashenko that fraternity between the people of Belarus and Ukraine should lead Belarus to “refuse to be a vassal and an accomplice to Russia in the war against Ukraine,” the statement said. Belarus was one one of several axes used by Russia to launch attacks on Ukraine, with Belarus the point to move toward the capital Kyiv, a senior U.S. defense official has said. Share this -







U.N. Security Council to meet Sunday UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. Security Council will meet Sunday afternoon to hold a procedural vote on a request by Ukraine for an emergency session of the 193-member General Assembly in light of Russia’s invasion of its country. There are no vetoes on a procedural vote in the council, unlike on resolutions. A procedural vote requires approval from nine of the 15 council members. Council diplomats said approval is virtually certain, and the emergency meeting of the General Assembly is expected to be held on Monday. Ukraine’s U.N. Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya tweeted Thursday that he asked General Assembly President Abdulla Shahid to prepare for an emergency meeting in the coming days. He said the meeting should be held under the so-called “Uniting for Peace” resolution, initiated by the United States and adopted in November 1950 to circumvent vetoes by the Soviet Union during the 1950-53 Korean War. The resolution gives the General Assembly the power to call emergency meetings to consider matters of international peace and security when the Security Council is unable to act because of the lack of unanimity among its five veto-wielding permanent members -- the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France. Russia vetoed a Security Council resolution Friday demanding that Moscow immediately stop its attack on Ukraine and withdraw all troops. Share this -

""This past week, alongside our diplomatic efforts and collective work to defend our own borders and to assist the Ukrainian government and people in their fight, we, as well as our other allies and partners around the world, imposed severe measures on key Russian institutions and banks, and on the architects of this war, including"" Putin. ""As Russian forces unleash their assault on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, we are resolved to continue imposing costs on Russia that will further isolate Russia from the international financial system and our economies,"" the statement continued. ""We will implement these measures within the coming days."" The allies said they ""commit to ensuring that selected Russian banks are removed from the SWIFT messaging system,"" will impose ""restrictive measures that will prevent the Russian Central Bank from deploying its international reserves in ways that undermine the impact of our sanctions,"" and that they ""commit to acting against the people and entities who facilitate the war in Ukraine and the harmful activities of the Russian government."" On that last bit, the group of nations said they will take ""measures to limit the sale of citizenship — so-called golden passports — that let wealthy Russians connected to the Russian government become citizens of our countries and gain access to our financial systems."" The nations said they will launch a task force this week to ensure the implementation of the sanctions and identify and freeze assets of sanctioned people and companies within each of their jurisdictions.
