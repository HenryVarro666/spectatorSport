British foreign secretary to visit Poland, call for tougher sanctions on Russia British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss will visit Poland on Monday to call for tougher sanctions on Russia, her office said, as major western countries work together to ramp up the pressure on President Vladimir Putin and end the conflict in Ukraine. ""Putin is yet to show he is serious about diplomacy. A tough approach from the UK and our allies is vital to strengthen Ukraine's hand in negotiations,"" Truss said. ""Britain has helped lead the way with sanctions to cripple the Putin war machine. We will do more to ramp up the pressure on Russia and we will keep pushing others to do more."" Truss is due to meet Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba in Poland's capital Warsaw later today and her Polish counterpart Zbigniew Rau on Tuesday. Britain, a former European Union member, has coordinated with international allies to impose sanctions on key Russian industries and Moscow's wealthy elites with the aim of crippling its economy in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Russia's chief investigator orders probe into Ukraine's Bucha claims Russia's chief investigator ordered an official probe into Ukraine's accusations of Russian forces killing hundreds of civilians in the town of Bucha, near Kyiv. In a statement Monday, Russia's Investigative Committee said it was looking into Ukraine's claims, as well as images shared by Ukrainian officials that it said aimed to ""discredit the Russian military personnel."" Russia has rejected the claim that its forces killed civilians in Bucha, despite photos and video appearing to show dead bodies on city streets as its troops pulled out of Bucha and other cities near Kyiv.

Zelenskyy decries war atrocities in new address, saying, 'Evil will be punished' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivered his harshest rebuke yet Sunday as Russian forces retreated from the war-torn city of Bucha, Ukraine, leaving in their wake a mass of what appeared to be civilian fatalities. ""Today this appeal will be without congratulations. I do not want any extra words. Presidents do not usually record appeals like this. But today I have to say just that. To say after what opened in Bucha and our other cities, from which the occupiers were chased out. Hundreds of people were killed. Tortured, shot — civilians. Bodies on the streets. Mined territory,"" Zelenskyy said. ""The bodies of the dead were mined."" Zelenskyy switched from speaking Ukrainian and made a direct appeal in Russian, saying: ""I want every mother of every Russian soldier to see the bodies of the killed people in Bucha, in Irpin, in Hostomel. What did they do? Why were they killed? What did the man who was riding his bicycle down the street do? Why were ordinary civilians tortured to death in an ordinary peaceful city? Why were women strangled after their earrings were torn out of their ears? How could women be raped and killed in front of children? Their bodies were mocked even after death. Why did they crush the bodies of people with tanks? What did the Ukrainian city of Bucha do to your Russia? How did all this become possible?"" He added: ""Russian mothers! Even if you raised marauders, how did they also become executioners? You couldn't help but know what's inside your children. You could not help but notice that they are deprived of everything human. No soul. No heart. They killed deliberately and with pleasure."" Speaking again in Ukrainian, Zelenskyy said that ""evil will be punished"" and that he had created a ""special mechanism of justice"" in Ukraine to investigate and prosecute every crime of Russian occupiers in the country. ""The essence of this mechanism is the joint work of national and international experts: investigators, prosecutors and judges. This mechanism will help Ukraine and the world to bring to justice those who unleashed or in any way participated in this terrible war against the Ukrainian people and in crimes against our people,"" he said.

Bucha residents say Russian troops killed civilians BUCHA, Ukraine — Residents of the Ukrainian town of Bucha, near the capital of Kyiv, have given harrowing accounts of how Russian troops shot and killed civilians without any apparent reason. Bodies of civilians lay strewn across the northern town, which was controlled by Russian soldiers for about a month. At a logistics compound that residents say was used as a base by Russian forces, the bodies of eight men could be seen dumped on the ground, some with their hands tied behind their backs.

NATO chief: This is 'not a real withdrawal' NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Sunday said Russia is shifting its strategy in Ukraine, explaining that Putin's retreat from Kyiv is not a sign that he is withdrawing from the country. “What we see is not a real withdrawal,"" Stoltenberg said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. ""What we see is that Russia is repositioning its troops, and they are taking some of them back to rearm them, to reinforce them, to resupply them. But we should not in a way be too optimistic because the attacks will continue."" His remarks came after Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned of a Russian buildup of forces in the east of his war-torn country, in a video posted to Telegram on Saturday. In an intelligence briefing, British defense officials said Moscow's naval forces have continued to blockade areas on Ukraine's southern coast, preventing resupply by sea. There is concern about ""potential increased attacks, especially in the south and in the east. So this is not a real withdrawal but more a shift in the strategy, focusing more on the south and the east,"" Stoltenberg added. Share this -

""And at the same time, they may be regrouping. They may be recalibrating."" In a video posted to Telegram on Saturday night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia was building up forces in the east of the country and called on Western countries to provide more anti-missile systems. Russia wants to ""capture both the Donbas and the south of Ukraine,"" he said. The U.S. has a strong interest in ending the violence, Blinken said, and ""the way to do that is to give Ukraine the strongest possible hand to put as much pressure as we possibly can on Russia, while we're strengthening our own defenses."" ""That's exactly what we've been doing,"" he added. ""Time is certainly not on Vladimir Putin's side, because, as I said, a sovereign, independent Ukraine has demonstrated it's going to be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin is on the scene.""

Russian naval forces block Ukraine's resupply by Black Sea, U.K. military intelligence says Russian naval forces continue to blockade the Ukrainian coast on the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, preventing resupply by sea, British military intelligence said Sunday. In its latest assessment of the situation, the U.K.'s defense ministry tweeted that Russia still retains the capability to attempt an amphibious landing, but such an operation is likely to be increasingly high risk given the time Ukrainian forces have had to prepare. ""Reported mines within the Black Sea pose a serious risk to maritime activity,"" it added. The report said the origin of the mines was unclear and disputed, but their presence was almost certainly the result of Russian naval activity in the area, demonstrating how its invasion of Ukraine is affecting neutral and civilian interests.

These offenses were committed between Feb. 27 and March 14, it said. Russian soldiers were also implicated in looting civilian property, including food, clothing and firewood, it said. “The cases we documented amount to unspeakable, deliberate cruelty and violence against Ukrainian civilians,” said Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Rape, murder, and other violent acts against people in the Russian forces’ custody should be investigated as war crimes.” Share this -

LAS VEGAS — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has appeared in a video at the Grammy Awards asking for support in telling the story of Ukraine’s invasion by Russia.

During the pre-recorded message that aired on the show Sunday night, he spoke in English, likening the attack to a deadly silence threatening to extinguish the dreams and lives of the Ukrainian people, including children.

In his words: “Our musicians wear body armor instead of tuxedos. They sing to the wounded in hospitals, even to those who can’t hear them. But the music will break through anyway.”

The Recording Academy, with its partner Global Citizen, prior to the ceremony highlighted a social media campaign called “Stand Up For Ukraine” to raise money and humanitarian support.

Zelenskyy told the audience: “Fill the silence with your music. Fill it today to tell our story. Tell the truth about the war on your social networks, on TV, support us in any way you can any, but not silence. And then peace will come to all our cities.”

Following Zelenskyy’s message, John Legend performed his song “Free” with Ukrainian musicians Siuzanna Iglidan and Mika Newton and poet Lyuba Yakimchuk as images from the war were shown on screens behind them.

OTHER DEVELOPMENTS:

KYIV, Ukraine — The Ukrainian military says that its forces have retaken some towns in the Chernihiv region and that humanitarian aid is being delivered.

The news agency RBK Ukraina says the road between Chernihiv and the capital of Kyiv is to reopen to some traffic later Monday.

Chernihiv is a city 80 miles north of Kyiv and it had been cut off from shipments of food and other supplies for weeks. The mayor said Sunday that relentless Russian shelling had destroyed 70% of the city.

Russian forces also withdrew from the Sumy region, in Ukraine’s northeast, local administrator Dmitry Zhivitsky said in a video message carried by Ukrainian news agencies Sunday. The troops had occupied the area for nearly a month.

In other areas recently retaken from Russian troops, Ukrainian officials say they have recovered hundreds of slain civilians in the past few days. Ukraine’s prosecutor-general says the bodies of 410 civilians have been recovered from Kyiv-area towns.

KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine’s prosecutor-general says the bodies of 410 civilians have been removed from Kyiv-area towns that were recently retaken from Russian troops.

Iryna Venediktova says on Facebook that the bodies were recovered Friday, Saturday and Sunday. She says 140 of them have undergone examination by prosecutors and other specialists.

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk says the mayor of the village of Motyzhyn in the Kyiv region was murdered while being held by Russian forces. Vereshchuk adds that there are 11 mayors and community heads in Russian captivity across Ukraine.

In a video address Sunday, Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denounced the allegedly targeted killings of civilians in towns that the Russians occupied, calling the killers “freaks who do not know how to do otherwise.” He warns that more atrocities may be revealed if Russian forces are driven out of other occupied areas.

International leaders have condemned the reported attacks in the Kyiv-area towns after harrowing accounts from civilians and graphic images of bodies with hands tied behind their backs.

Russia’s Defense Ministry has rejected the claims of atrocities against civilians in Bucha and other suburbs of Kyiv.

BALAKLIYA, Ukraine — The governor of the Kharkiv region says Russian troops fired on a convoy of buses that was trying to evacuate patients from a hospital that had been heavily damaged in shelling a day earlier.

The governor, Oleh Synyehubov, said Sunday that about 70 patients needed to be taken away from the damaged hospital in the town of Balakliya but that the buses were not able to enter the town.

He said there was preliminary information that one of the bus drivers was killed.

Balakliya is about 75 kilometers (45 miles) southeast of the city of Kharkiv, which has been heavily hit by Russian attacks.

BERLIN — Germany’s defense minister says European officials should talk about halting gas supplies from Russia in light of the alleged attacks on civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha.

Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said Sunday night on German public broadcaster ARD that “there must be a reaction. Such crimes must not go unanswered.”

So far, Germany and several other European governments have shied away from an immediate boycott of Russian natural gas over fears of the impact it would have on their economies.

Europe gets 40% of its gas and 25% of its oil from Russia, and since the war, has scrambled to set out proposals to reduce its dependency. Russia is just as reliant on Europe, with oil and gas its dominant sector and paying for government operations.

Estimates of the impact of a gas boycott or embargo on Europe vary but most involve a substantial loss of economic output.

JERUSALEM __ Israel’s foreign minister is condemning the reported atrocities in Ukraine, saying deliberate harm to civilians is a war crime.

Foreign Minister Yair Lapid wrote on Twitter that one “cannot remain indifferent” after seeing images from the town of Bucha near Ukraine capital.

Israel has walked a tightrope since Russia invaded Ukraine, simultaneously denouncing the invasion while avoiding taking too strident a stance out of concern of angering Moscow, with whom it has security coordination in neighboring Syria. Israel has good relations with both countries and has mediated between them since the invasion on Feb. 24.

Lapid says that intentionally harming a civilian population is a war crime and strongly condemned it.

MOTYZHYN, Ukraine — A resident says the mayor of the Ukrainian town of Motyzhyn was killed in an execution-style slaying along with her husband and son.

Another resident of the town 50 kilometers (31 miles) west of Kyiv told the The Associated Press on Sunday that Russian troops targeted local officials in a bid to win them over and killed them if they did not collaborate. That man, Oleg, declined to give his full name for security reasons.

The mayor, Olga Sukhenko, and her family were shot and thrown into a pit in a forest behind a plot of land with three houses where Russian forces had slept. A fourth body was not yet identified.

The mayor and her family had been reported by others as kidnapped by Russians on March 23 and taken in an unknown direction.

LONDON — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson says Russia’s attack on Ukranian civilians in towns on the outskirts of Kyiv “are yet more evidence that Russian President Vladimir Putin and his army are committing war crimes in Ukraine.”

Johnson called the attacks in the towns of Irpin and Bucha “despicable” and says he “will do everything in my power to starve Putin’s war machine.” Johnson added that the U.K. will step up its sanctions and military support for Ukraine, but did not provide details.

Other European leaders also condemned the reported attacks on Ukranian civilians in response to images of bodies in the streets and some of the dead with their hands tied behind their backs.

Leaders in France, Germany, Italy, Greece, Czech Republic and Poland expressed outrage at the images. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala called the images ”horrifying” and says Russia has been committing war crimes.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz says international organizations should be given access to the areas to independently document the atrocities.

French Foreign Affairs Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian says his country will work with Ukrainian authorities and the International Criminal Court “to ensure these acts don’t go unpunished.”

BRUSSELS — NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg says the graphic images coming out of Bucha, Ukraine, after Russian troops withdrew show “a brutality against civilians we haven’t seen in Europe for decades.”

He tells CNN’s “State of the Union” that “it’s absolutely unacceptable that civilians are targeted and killed” and that it’s Russian President Vladimir Putin’s responsibility to stop the war.

Stoltenberg says it’s “extremely important” that the International Criminal Court has opened an investigation into potential war crimes in Ukraine and that those responsible are held to account.

His comments echoed those by other European leaders, who condemned alleged war crimes and civilian killings by Russian forces in Ukrainian towns including Bucha near Kyiv, the capital.

BUCHA, Ukraine — Residents of the Ukrainian town of Bucha near the capital of Kyiv have given harrowing accounts of how Russian troops shot and killed civilians without any apparent reason.

Bodies of civilians lay strewn across the northern town, which was controlled by Russian soldiers for about a month.

At a logistics compound that residents say was used as a base by Russian forces, the bodies of 8 men could be seen dumped on the ground, some with their hands tied behind their backs.

Residents say Russian troops would go from building to building, take people out of the basements where they were hiding from the fighting, check their phones for evidence of anti-Russian activity and take them away or shoot them.

Russia’s Defense Ministry has rejected the claims of atrocities against civilians in Bucha and other suburbs of Kyiv as a “provocation.”

The ministry says that “not a single civilian has faced any violent action by the Russian military“ in Bucha.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, told a U.S. television interview Sunday that Russian attacks in Ukraine amount to genocide.

ROME — The head of Italy’s Democratic Party called for a full oil and gas embargo in reaction to images emerging of atrocities against civilians by Russian soldiers retreating from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv.

“How many #Buca before we move to a full oil and gas Russia embargo,” Enrico Letta wrote on Twitter Sunday. “Time is over.”

Italy gets 40% of its natural gas from Russia and officials have said it would take three years to make the transition to other sources.

Premier Mario Draghi acknowledged last week that energy payments were fueling Russia’s invasion, and the foreign minister has been traveling to oil and gas producing countries to line up alternatives to Russia.

WASHINGTON — White House chief of staff Ron Klain says the U.S. remains fully committed to providing a full range of economic and military support to Ukraine in its war against Russia, which he describes as “far from over.”

Klain credits Ukrainians for fighting off Russian troops in the northern part of Ukraine and says the U.S. and its allies are sending weapons into the country “almost every single day.”

But he also tells ABC’s “This Week” that there are signs that Russian President Vladimir Putin is redeploying Russian troops to the eastern part of Ukraine.

Klain says while it will be up to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to decide if the political endgame is to allow Russia to occupy the eastern part of Ukraine, from the U.S. standpoint, the “military future of this attack has to be push back.”

He says regarding a potential Russian occupation of eastern Ukraine: “I will tell you, as President Zelenskyy has said, that’s not acceptable to him, and we are going to support him with military aid, with economic aid, with humanitarian aid.”

KYIV, Ukraine — The Ukrainian military says Russian troops have completed their pullback from the country’s north.

The military’s General Staff said in Sunday’s statement that Russian units have withdrawn from areas in the country’s north to neighboring Belarus, which served as a staging ground for the Russian invasion.

The Ukrainian military said its airborne forces have taken full control of the town of Pripyat just outside the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear power plant and the section of the border with Belarus. It posted a picture of the Ukrainian soldier putting up the country’s flag with a shelter containing the Chernobyl reactor that exploded in 1986 seen in the background.

VILNIUS, Lithuania — Lithuania says it has cut itself off entirely of gas imports from Russia and that it’s the first of the European Union’s 27 nations using Russian gas to break its energy dependence upon Moscow.

“Seeking full energy independence from Russian gas, in response to Russia’s energy blackmail in Europe and the war in Ukraine, Lithuania has completely abandoned Russian gas,” Lithuania’s energy ministry said in a statement late Saturday, adding that the measure took effect in the beginning of April.

Lithuania reduced imports of Russian gas to zero on Saturday, a move seen a milestone in achieving energy independence in the former Soviet republic of 2.8 million, the ministry said.

“We are the first EU country among Gazprom’s supply countries to gain independence from Russian gas supplies, and this is the result of a multi-year coherent energy policy and timely infrastructure decisions,” Minister of Energy Dainius Kreivys said.

Lithuania’a president posted an upbeat tweet on his account and urged other European nations to do the same.

KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine’s top diplomat has called for tougher sanctions on Russia over growing evidence of what he called a massacre of civilians in the suburbs of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.

Ukrainian officials said earlier Sunday that scores of killed civilians have been found on the streets of Kyiv’ suburbs of Bucha, Irpin and Hostomel after the withdrawal of Russian troops. They said that some of the victims were shot in the head and had their hands bound.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted Sunday that the killings were “deliberate,” adding that “Russians aim to eliminate as many Ukrainians as they can.”

He urged the West to impose an oil, gas and coal embargo, and close all ports to Russian vessels and goods. He also called for all Russian banks to be disconnected from the SWIFT international payment system.

In Germany President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said in Berlin that “the war crimes committed by Russia are visible before the eyes of the world.”

German news agency dpa reported that Steinmeier said “the images from Bucha shake me, they shake us deeply.”

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock pledged to tighten sanctions against Russia but did not give details.

BERLIN — Poland’s most powerful politician says he is open to the permanent stationing of U.S. nuclear weapons in Eastern Europe.

Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of Poland’s ruling conservative party, Law and Justice, said Sunday in an interview with German weekly Welt am Sonntag that “in principle, it makes sense to extend nuclear participation to the eastern flank.”

Kaczynski added that “if the Americans asked us to store U.S. nuclear weapons in Poland, we would be open to it. It would significantly strengthen deterrence against Moscow.”

Kaczynski acknowledged that “at the moment, this question does not arise, but that may change soon.”

The Polish leader also called for a much stronger presence of U.S. soldiers in Europe in the future, especially on NATO’s eastern flank.

He said that “Poland would welcome an increase in the American presence in Europe in the future from the current 100,000 soldiers to 150,000 soldiers because of Russia’s increasing aggressiveness.”

MOSCOW — The Kremlin says that by imposing sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin the West has demonstrated it has abandoned its sense of reason.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in televised remarks Sunday that the sanctions against Putin were going “beyond the edge of reason,” adding that they showed that the West is “capable of any stupidities.”

Peskov added that Putin’s meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is “hypothetically possible” once negotiators from the two countries prepared a draft agreement to be discussed.

KYIV, Ukraine — A Ukrainian presidential adviser says authorities have found evidence of serious war crimes by Russian troops on the outskirts of Kyiv.

Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said Sunday scores of killed civilians have been found on the streets of Kyiv’ suburbs of Irpin, Bucha and Hostomel after the withdrawal of Russian troops. He compared the scene to “a horror movie.”

Arestovych said some victims were shot in the head and had their hands bound, and some of the bodies had signs of torture. He accused Russian troops of raping women and trying to burn their bodies.

Arestovych said Ukrainian authorities will investigate the alleged war crimes and track down the perpetrators.

The reports drew international condemnation. In Britain, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said there is increasing evidence of “indiscriminate attacks against innocent civilians” and said they must be investigated as war crimes.

“We will not allow Russia to cover up their involvement in these atrocities through cynical disinformation and will ensure that the reality of Russia’s actions are brought to light,” she said.

MOSCOW — Russia’s top negotiator in talks with Ukraine says it’s too early to talk about a meeting between the two countries’ president.

Vladimir Medinsky, who led the Russian delegation in Tuesday’s talks in Istanbul, Turkey, said “there is still a lot of work to do” to finalize a draft agreement before Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could meet.

Speaking Sunday in remarks carried by the Interfax news agency, Medinsky reaffirmed that the parties reached a tentative agreement on the need for Ukraine to adopt a neutral status and refrain from holding foreign military bases in exchange for international security guarantees.

Asked about Ukrainian negotiator Davyd Arakhamia’s claim that Moscow’s negotiators had informally agreed to most proposals by Ukraine during the talks in Istanbul this week and the two presidents could discuss the draft deal, Medinsky said he doesn’t share Arakhamia’s optimism. He said the talks will continue online Monday.

Medinsky emphasized that Russia’s stand on Crimea and rebel regions in Ukraine’s east remained unchanged. The Kremlin demands that Ukraine acknowledge Russia’s sovereignty over Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014, and recognize the independence of Russia-backed separatist regions in Donbas, Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland.

BERLIN — The mayor of the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, has expressed shock at what he called “cruel war crimes” committed by Russian soldiers in the town of Bucha northwest of the capital.

Referring to reports of executed civilians, Klitschko told German daily Bild on Sunday that “what happened in Bucha and other suburbs of Kyiv can only be described as genocide.”

An AP crew on Sunday saw the bodies of at least nine people who appear to have been executed. At least two of them had their hands tied behind their backs. They were all in civilian clothes and at least three were naked from the waist up. One appeared shot in the chest from close range.

Klitschko said Russian President Vladimir Putin was responsible for the “cruel war crimes,” adding that civilians had been “shot with tied hands.”

He called on the the whole world and especially Germany to immediately end gas imports from Russia.

He said that “especially for Germany, there can only be one consequence: Not a penny should go to Russia anymore, that’s bloody money used to slaughter people. The gas and oil embargo must come immediately.”",https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-middle-east-black-sea-religion-a97f60a50df0d8dc1e0f126a33144560

He described a column of dark smoke rising from the targets and flames from the buildings.

""What we can see is a dense screen of dark smoke, and one explosion after the other,"" Orlandi said.

Attacks in Kharkiv

The governor of the Kharkiv region says Russian troops fired on a convoy of buses that was trying to transport patients from a hospital that had been heavily damaged in shelling a day earlier.

Gov. Oleh Synyehubov said Sunday that about 70 patients needed to be taken away from the damaged hospital in the town of Balakliya — about 75 kilometres southeast of the city of Kharkiv — but that the buses were not able to enter the town. He said there was preliminary information that one of the bus drivers was killed.

Earlier on Sunday, Synyehubov said Russian artillery and tanks carried out more than 20 strikes on Kharkiv and its outskirts over the past 24 hours.

Synyehubov had said said four people were wounded in a Russian missile strike on Lozova, in the south of the Kharkiv region.

Russians withdrawing from north

The Ukrainian military says Russian troops have completed their pullback from the country's north.

The military's General Staff said in Sunday's statement that Russian units have withdrawn from areas in the country's north to neighbouring Belarus, which served as a staging ground for the Russian invasion.

Officials working on Mariupol evacuations

Work on evacuating Mariupol was to continue on Sunday with buses attempting to come close to the besieged city, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said.

Vereshchuk said Ukrainian officials were in talks with Russia to allow several Red Cross buses to enter the city. The Red Cross abandoned earlier attempts due to security concerns. Russia blamed the Red Cross for the delays.

Mariupol is Russia's main target in Ukraine's southeastern region of Donbas — an area that's been partly controlled by Moscow-backed separatists since 2014 — and tens of thousands of civilians there have been trapped for weeks with scant access to food and water.

The fall of the southern port city would help Russia establish a land bridge from the Donbas to Crimea, a southern region annexed by Russia in 2014.

Vereshchuk also said on Sunday that 2,694 people were rescued from conflict zones in Mariupol and the region of Luhansk, which is also located in the Donbas region.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ukraine-russia-war-1.6406800

11:10 p.m. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala says the country should cut its dependence on Russian energy resources within five years, calling the current situation one of the Czech Republic's ""greatest security risks."" The EU member meets its gas needs almost entirely through shipments directly or indirectly from Russia, and gets roughly half its crude imports from the same source. Fiala adds the country's energy sector has to change ""completely.""

9:59 p.m. European Union countries sharing borders with Russia and Belarus bar some cargo vehicles registered in the two countries from entering due to sanctions, the Russian customs service says, according to Reuters. Vehicles used as international transport that have Russian and Belarusian number plates will not be able to move goods on EU territory, the Russian customs service says. This comes after the EU on Friday formally adopted new sanctions against Russia, including bans on the import of coal, wood, chemicals and other products, while also preventing many Russian vessels and trucks from accessing the bloc.

3:31 p.m. S&P lowers Russia's foreign currency ratings to ""selective default"" on increased risks that Moscow will not be able and willing to honor its commitments to foreign debtholders.

11:50 a.m. Russia's justice ministry says it has revoked the registration of 15 foreign organizations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. The Russian units of the 15 organizations, which include the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, ""were excluded due to the discovery of violations of the current legislation of the Russian Federation,"" the ministry said in a statement on Friday.

The decision, which did not give details of any violations, was announced days after New York-based HRW said it had found ""several cases of Russian military forces committing laws-of-war violations"" in Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied war crimes allegations by Ukraine and Western countries during its six-week-long invasion of Ukraine and denies targeting civilians.

4:10 a.m. Germany is working to end imports of Russian oil and believes it may do so this year, Chancellor Olaf Scholz says in London during a news conference with U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

The European Union is studying ways to phase out its imports of Russian oil, according to EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. But ending German dependence on Russian natural gas poses a higher hurdle. No timeline has been set for such a transition.

The U.K. has announced plans to phase out imports of Russian coal and crude oil by the end of 2022, followed by gas imports at an early date.

3:17 a.m. The U.S. believes Russia used a short-range ballistic missile to strike a railway station in east Ukraine on Friday, a senior U.S. defense official says. Ukraine said at least 50 people were killed and many more wounded in the strike.

Friday, April 8

10:30 p.m. The ruble rallied after Russia's central bank cut its main interest rate in a surprise move. The cut, which follows new sanctions on Russia including a U.S. ban on crude oil imports, partly reverses an emergency rate hike in late February after the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""Today's decision reflects a change in the balance of risks of accelerated consumer price growth, decline in economic activity and financial stability risks,"" the Central Bank of Russia says in a statement reported by Interfax.

8:50 p.m. Russian citizens are spending on average 40% of their disposable income on food, about double the amount from before Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, the director of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization's Russia liaison office tells Reuters. Russian government data shows annual food inflation hit 18.75% on April 1 as the economy reels from Western sanctions. The average European Union household spends about 12% of its income on food, the director says.

Meanwhile, global food prices have hit record levels in the wake of the Ukraine war, the latest FAO data shows.

6:00 p.m. More than 30 people were killed and over 100 were wounded in a Russian rocket strike on a railway station in eastern Ukraine on Friday as civilians tried to evacuate to safer parts of the country, the state railway company says. It said two Russian rockets struck a station in the city of Kramatorsk, which is used to evacuate civilians from areas under bombardment by Russian forces.

4:50 p.m. Japan's Foreign Ministry says it will expel a number of Russian diplomats stationed in the country in Tokyo's latest response to the civilian killings reported during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Eight Russians, including diplomats, will be expelled, it announced Friday. Japan has been cautious about expelling Russian diplomats up to now, but changed course as the U.S. and European countries have moved to punish Russia diplomatically. Tokyo's decision is likely to prompt Moscow to make tit-for-tat expulsions of Japanese diplomats from Russia.

3:30 p.m. India's central bank cuts its economic growth forecast for the fiscal year that started April 1 to 7.2%, from the 7.8% projected in February, citing the Russia-Ukraine war.

""Although India's direct trade exposure to countries at the epicenter of the conflict is limited, the war could potentially impede the economic recovery through elevated commodity prices and global spillover channels,"" Reserve Bank of India Gov. Shaktikanta Das says.

There are several other factors at work, he adds. ""Financial market volatility induced by monetary policy normalization in advanced economies, renewed COVID-19 infections in some major countries with augmented supply-side disruptions and protracted shortages of critical inputs, such as semiconductors and chips, pose downside risks to the outlook.""

3:18 p.m. Ukraine says it aims to establish up to 10 humanitarian corridors to evacuate trapped civilians on Friday, but civilians trying to flee the besieged southern city of Mariupol will have to use private vehicles. The 10 planned safe corridors announced by Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk were all in southern and eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian officials say Moscow plans to seize as much territory as it can in the eastern part of Ukraine known as Donbas bordering Russia.

11:00 a.m. The chairman of Russian aluminum giant Rusal calls for an impartial investigation into the killing of civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, which he described as a crime, and urged an end to the ""fratricidal"" conflict. While the statement from Chairman Bernard Zonneveld, a Dutch national, did not touch on who was to blame for the deaths of civilians in the town, it is unusual for a large Russian company to comment publicly on the conflict. ""We support an objective and impartial investigation of this crime and call for severe punishment for the perpetrators,"" he said.

10:18 a.m. Japan will phase out Russian coal imports as part of its sanctions against Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine, Japan's industry minister says, joining other Group of Seven industrialized nations. Koichi Hagiuda told a regular news conference that Japan will gradually reduce the amount imported from Russia, and eventually break Japan's dependence on its coal, saying, ""We seek to stop importing in the end."" The move comes a day after G-7 foreign ministers vowed to ""expedite"" plans to end their energy dependence on Russia by phasing out and banning Russian coal imports to punish Moscow.

9:05 a.m. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says work has begun to dig through the rubble in Borodianka, a city northwest of Kyiv that was occupied by Russian military forces. He also said ""it is much scarier"" there, with even more victims of Russian troops. In his daily nighttime video address to the nation Thursday, Zelenskyy said the Russians were preparing to shock the world in the same way by showing corpses in Mariupol and falsely claiming they were killed by the Ukrainian defenders.

4:30 a.m. Pink Floyd is releasing its first new music in almost three decades to raise money for the people of Ukraine, the band announces. ""Hey Hey Rise Up"" features Pink Floyd members David Gilmour and Nick Mason, with vocals from Ukrainian singer Andriy Khlyvnyuk of the band BoomBox.

The track features Khlyvnyuk singing a patriotic Ukrainian song from a clip he recorded in front of Kyiv's St. Sophia Cathedral and posted on social media.

2:51 a.m. Russia has sustained ""significant"" troop losses in Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov tells British television channel Sky News.

""We have significant losses of troops, and ... it's a huge tragedy for us,"" he says when responding to interviewer Mark Austin's question: ""You've lost thousands of troops. How many troops have you lost?""

Peskov expresses hope that the operation will achieve its goals, or end via negotiations, in the coming days but also calls verified imagery of dead civilians in Bucha a ""bold fake.""

Russia's Defense Ministry reported March 25 that 1,351 service members had been killed, and 3,825 wounded, since the start of the operation, state news agency Tass says in a brief story about the interview.

2:00 a.m. The United Nations suspends Russia from the Human Rights Council in a vote. Ninety-three member states voted for the resolution. Twenty-four voted against, including Russia and China.

Thursday, April 7

11:55 p.m. The U.S. Senate overwhelmingly backs legislation to remove ""most favored nation"" trade status for Russia and its close ally Belarus over the invasion of Ukraine, allowing for higher tariffs on imports from the two countries. As voting continues, the tally in the 100-member Senate was 65-0 in favor of removing Permanent Normal Trade Relations status.

Senate approval will send the measure to the House of Representatives, where passage is expected later on Thursday, sending the legislation to the White House for President Joe Biden to sign into law.

6:30 p.m. Russia's communications watchdog said on Thursday it was taking punitive measures against Google, including a ban on advertising the platform and its information resources, for violating Russian law. Roskomnadzor accused Google's YouTube video-sharing platform, which has shut out Russian state-funded media globally, of becoming ""one of the key platforms spreading fakes (fake images) about the course of (Russia's) special military operation on the territory of Ukraine, discrediting the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.""

3:40 p.m. Shell will write down up to $5 billion following its decision to exit Russia, higher than previously disclosed, while soaring oil and gas prices boosted trading activities in the first quarter, the company says. The post-tax impairments of between $4 billion and $5 billion in the first quarter will not impact the company's earnings, Shell said in an update ahead of its earnings announcement on May 5. It had previously said the Russia write-downs would reach around $3.4 billion.

1:30 p.m. The U.N. General Assembly will vote on Thursday on a U.S. push to suspend Russia from its Human Rights Council over reports of ""gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights"" by Russian troops in Ukraine. A two-thirds majority of voting members -- abstentions do not count -- can suspend a country from the 47-member council. Western diplomats are confident they have enough support among the 193-member General Assembly to adopt a resolution to suspend Moscow.

10:30 a.m. International Energy Agency states have agreed to tap 60 million barrels of oil from storage, the director of the group says, on top of a 180-million-barrel release announced by Washington last week aimed at cooling prices after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The move by the U.S.-allied IEA countries, which represent 31 mostly industrialized countries but not Russia, would be their second coordinated release in a month and would be the fifth in the agency's history to confront oil market outages.

10:18 a.m. U.S. sanctions against two of Russia's largest banks are ""a direct blow to the Russian population [and] ordinary citizens,"" the Tass news agency cites Russia's U.S. ambassador as saying on Wednesday.

5:00 a.m. The U.S. believes Russian forces have completely withdrawn from the area around Kyiv, a senior American official says.

The troops were pulling back to Belarus and Russia to regroup, the official says. They may join the fighting in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donbas, which Russia has designated the new focus of its ""special military operation"" -- what Moscow calls its invasion.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also says a small number of Ukrainians are receiving training in the U.S. to use tank-killing Switchblade drones. These Ukrainians are supposed to return to their country soon, the official says.

4:00 a.m. Chinese President Xi Jinping's personal alliance with Russian President Vladimir Putin is hampering China's diplomacy. That is becoming clearer as the war in Ukraine rages on.

Both men have laid the groundwork to stay in power until the middle of the 2030s. Both have territorial ambitions: reestablishing the former Soviet Union's sphere of influence for Putin, Taiwan for Xi. But the association comes with significant risk. Read more in this week's China Up Close.

2:00 a.m. One world leader willing to accept Russia's demand to pay for natural gas in rubles is Hungary's Victor Orban.

The Hungarian prime minister, whose right-wing ruling party won by a landslide in a parliamentary election Sunday, tells a news conference he has called on Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine immediately and says he is reconsidering his country's close ties with Moscow. Yet Orban says ""if the Russians request it, we will pay in rubles,"" the Financial Times reports.

Germany and other countries have rejected Putin's demand for payment in rubles, which Russia has yet to enforce.

2:10 a.m. New U.S. sanctions on Russia add the country's top bank, Sberbank, to the list of targets, as well as family members of Russia President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. These and other international responses to Russia's invasion of Ukraine are not lost on China, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman says.

""The strong and coordinated response from the international community, including nations in the Indo-Pacific, to Russia's flagrant violations on international law and principles like sovereignty and territorial integrity sends a strong signal that such actions will not go ignored,"" Sherman tells the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

The range of sanctions and ""unprecedented"" coordination between the U.S. and its partners give Chinese President Xi Jinping a ""good understanding of what might come his way should he in fact support Putin in any material fashion,"" Sherman says.

On support for U.S. partners, Republican Congressman Michael McCaul of Texas says: ""Putin's invasion of Russia shows us how critical it is to give our allies the weapons they need before an invasion and not after."" McCaul is preparing to introduce a bill that would create ""a security assistance program for Taiwan.""

Wednesday, April 6

8:00 p.m. Mere months ago Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was on the ropes. The lira had crashed and his unorthodox monetary policy was being ridiculed in financial markets.

But the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and its subsequent struggles on the battlefield, have led to a dramatic diplomatic turnaround for Turkey, which finds itself at the center of efforts to establish a cease-fire.

It stands in contrast to China and India, who have been criticized by the global community for sitting on the fence. Read more.

6:00 p.m. Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar says in parliament that New Delhi is ""deeply disturbed"" by the reports of civilians killed in Bucha. ""We strongly condemned the killings which have taken place there. This is an extremely serious matter, and we support the call for an independent investigation,"" he adds.

India, which has extensive defense dealings with Russia, has been reluctant to speak out against the invasion.

""If India has chosen a side, it is the side of peace and it is for an immediate end to violence,"" Jaishankar says.

5:37 p.m. Pope Francis condemns the ""massacre of Bucha,"" while holding up a Ukrainian flag sent to him from the town where hundreds of civilians were executed and mass graves have been found.

""Recent news from the war in Ukraine, instead of bringing relief and hope, brought new atrocities, such as the massacre of Bucha,"" he said during his weekly address. ""Cruelty that is increasingly horrendous, even against civilians, defenseless women and children. They are victims whose innocent blood cries out up to heaven and implores: 'Stop this war! Let the weapons fall silent! Stop sowing death and destruction.'""

The Kremlin said on Tuesday allegations that Russian forces committed war crimes by executing civilians in Bucha were a ""monstrous forgery"" aimed at denigrating its army.

11:18 a.m. U.S. chipmaker Intel says it has suspended operations in Russia, joining a slew of companies exiting the country following its invasion of Ukraine. The company, which last month suspended shipments to customers in Russia and Belarus, said it has implemented business continuity measures to minimize disruption to its global operations.

IBM, too, has suspended shipments, as Ukraine urged U.S. cloud-computing and software companies to cut off business with Russia. Servers from IBM, Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard top the market in Russia, where companies and government agencies have relied on technology developed by the West as the basis for their IT systems.

4:20 a.m. The U.S. and its Group of Seven and European Union allies on Wednesday will impose new sanctions against Russian banks and government officials and ban investment in Russia, a source familiar with the announcement tells Reuters.

The measures will ""degrade key instruments of Russian state power, impose acute and immediate economic harm on Russia and hold accountable the Russian kleptocracy that funds and supports (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's war,"" the source says.

3:00 a.m. NATO foreign ministers will meet with their counterparts from the Asia-Pacific this week, seeking to gain their cooperation in deepening the economic and diplomatic isolation of Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.

Top diplomats from eight countries and the European Union will take part, including Ukraine as well as Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. In light of reports of alleged war crimes by Russia in Ukraine, the ministers are expected to discuss their responses, including additional assistance to Kyiv.

""Targeting and murdering civilians is a war crime,"" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg tells reporters on Tuesday. Read more.

2:45 a.m. Asked whether the U.S. was providing military training to Ukrainians outside of Ukraine, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin says: ""To use some of the gear, certainly they have to have training, and we're doing that.""

Austin's comments come at a House Armed Services Committee hearing with Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair Gen. Mark Milley.

2:30 a.m. The United Nations has failed to function in the face of the worst war crimes since World War II, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has told the U.N. Security Council.

Tuesday, April 5

11:13 p.m. The Czech Republic has sent T-72 tanks and BVP-1 infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine, a Czech defense source tells Reuters.

10:00 p.m. The 30 NATO allies would welcome Finland and Sweden into the alliance if they decided to join, but any such move is up to the two nations, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg says.

NATO likely would find ways ""to address the concerns they may have about this interim period between having applied and until the last ratification [by allies] has taken place,"" he says, referring to possible Russian retaliation before the pair were fully under NATO protection.

5:52 p.m. Italy has expelled 30 Russian diplomats because of security concerns, according to Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio. Denmark says it will expel 15 Russian diplomats, in line with steps taken by other European Union countries, after reports of mass graves of civilians being found in Bucha.

5:30 p.m. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Ukraine has no option but to negotiate with Russia to end the fighting but that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin may not personally hold talks. ""All of us, including myself, will perceive even the possibility of negotiations as a challenge,"" Zelenskyy says in an interview with Ukrainian journalists broadcast on national television.

2:50 p.m. Ukrainian forces have retaken key northern terrain, forcing Russian forces to retreat from areas around the city of Chernihiv and north of the capital, Kyiv, British military intelligence says. Low-level fighting is likely to continue in some of the recaptured areas but reduce this week as the remainder of the Russian forces withdraw, the defense ministry said in a regular bulletin on Twitter. Many of the withdrawing Russian units are likely to require significant reequipping and refurbishment before they redeploy for operations in the country's east, the ministry added.

12:10 p.m. The U.S. has stopped the Russian government from paying holders of its sovereign debt totaling more than $600 million from reserves held at American banks. Under sanctions put in place after Russia invaded Ukraine, foreign currency reserves held by the Russian central bank at U.S. financial institutions were frozen. But the Treasury Department had been allowing Moscow to use those funds to make coupon payments on dollar-denominated sovereign debt on a case-by-case basis.

11:54 a.m. Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi returns home from Poland, bringing 20 evacuees from Ukraine in a show of Tokyo's latest support for the war-torn nation and neighboring countries.

9:56 a.m. Russia will respond proportionately to the expulsion of its diplomats from a number of Western countries, says Dmitry Medvedev, former Russian president and current deputy secretary of the country's Security Council. ""Everyone knows the answer: It will be symmetrical and destructive for bilateral relations,"" he said on his Telegram channel. ""Who have they punished? First of all, themselves.""

8:42 a.m. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he will address the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday and predicted that further and worse instances of mass killings of civilians by Russian troops would be discovered. Tuesday's Security Council session is to consider Ukrainian allegations of the murder of civilians by Russian soldiers in Bucha, northwest of Kyiv, following the discovery of hundreds of bodies, some bound and shot at close range.

4:33 a.m. A team from the International Committee of the Red Cross is detained by police during an attempt to reach the Ukrainian city of Mariupol to evacuate civilians and is being held nearby in Manhush, a spokesperson tells Reuters.

2:30 a.m. France and Germany will expel Russian diplomats in response to the alleged killings of civilians in Bucha.

Germany will declare about 40 Russian diplomats as personae non gratae, Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock says. Germany media say these diplomats will have to leave the country within five days of such a declaration.

Moscow says it will respond to Paris' decision, RIA Novosti reports.

2:05 a.m. The U.S. will work with its partners to try to suspend Russia's membership on the United Nations Human Rights Council, says Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. representative to the U.N.

The ambassador is part of an international chorus of voices denouncing Russia after new allegations of war crimes in Ukraine. Moscow denies that its forces were responsible for civilian deaths in Bucha.

12:35 a.m. U.S. President Joe Biden labels Russian President Vladimir Putin a war criminal and calls for a war crimes trial as the global outcry mounts over civilian killings in the Ukrainian town of Bucha.

""You saw what happened in Bucha,"" Biden tells reporters at the White House, referring to the discovery of a mass grave and tied bodies shot at close range. ""This warrants him -- he is a war criminal."" The Kremlin denies any accusations related to the murder of civilians, including in Bucha.

12:30 a.m. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says it will be more difficult for Ukraine to negotiate with Russia after the scale of atrocities carried out by Russian troops in occupied territories has become known. The Ukrainian leader speaks on national television from the town of Bucha in the Kyiv region, where tied bodies shot at close range, a mass grave and other signs of executions have been found in territory retaken from Russian troops.

Moscow has denied any accusations related to the killing of civilians in Bucha.

8:28 p.m. France faces a repeat of the 2017 presidential election showdown between Emmanuel Macron and far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, with Macron still favored but in a much tighter race as his lead narrows, opinion polls show ahead of the first round of voting on Sunday.

Five years ago, Macron beat Le Pen with 66.1% of the vote in the runoff, with voters of all stripes rallying behind the centrist. But the latest poll forecasts just a 53%-47% margin of victory for President Macron. Le Pen has improved her standing with a campaign focused on the declining purchasing power of middle- and lower-income voters.

5:00 p.m. Russia's chief investigator orders an official investigation into what he calls a ""provocation"" from Ukraine after Kyiv accused the Russian military of massacring civilians in the town of Bucha.

12:05 p.m. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made a surprise video appearance at the music industry's star-studded Grammy Awards celebration in Las Vegas and appealed to viewers to support his country ""in any way you can."" ""What is more opposite to music? The silence of ruined cities and killed people,"" said Zelenskyy in the video. ""Fill the silence with your music. Fill it today, to tell our story. Support us in any way you can. Any, but not silence."" He added, ""Our musicians wear body armor instead of tuxedos, they sing to the wounded, in hospitals, even to those who can't hear them, but the music will break through.""

10:10 a.m. Oil prices extend losses Monday as investors eye the release of supplies from strategic reserves from consuming nations, while a truce in Yemen could ease supply disruption concerns in the Middle East. Brent crude futures fell 79 cents, or 0.8%, to $103.60 a barrel by 0037 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was at $98.45 a barrel, down 82 cents, or 0.8%.

The United Nations has brokered a two-month truce between a Saudi-led coalition and the Houthi group aligned with Iran for the first time in the seven-year conflict. Saudi oil facilities have come under attack by the Houthis during the conflict, adding to supply disruption from Russia.

8:00 a.m. Hungary's nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban scored a fourth consecutive landslide win in Sunday's election, as voters endorsed his ambition for a conservative, ""illiberal"" state and shrugged off concerns over Budapest's close ties with Moscow. Russia's invasion of Ukraine had appeared to upend Orban's campaign, forcing him into awkward maneuvering to explain decade-old cozy business relations with President Vladimir Putin. But he mounted a successful campaign to persuade his Fidesz party's core electorate that the six-party opposition alliance of Peter Marki-Zay promising to mend ties with the European Union could lead the country into war, an accusation the opposition denied.

5:50 a.m. Pope Francis pays tribute to journalists killed during the Ukraine war, saying he hoped God would reward them for serving the common good whatever side they were on. At least six journalists have died since Russian forces invaded Ukraine in late February.

Speaking with journalists aboard the papal plane returning from Malta, Francis reiterates that he is ready to visit Kyiv but adds that he has yet to decide whether it is feasible.

12:28 a.m. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba accuses Russian forces of carrying out a ""massacre"" in the town of Bucha as images of corpses in civilian clothes left behind by departing Russian troops prompt calls from officials in Ukraine and Europe for tougher sanctions on Russia.

11:26 p.m. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken tells CNN the images of dead Ukrainian civilians found in Bucha after Russian troops left are a ""punch in the gut"" and that those responsible for any war crimes must be held accountable. Ukrainian forces had moved into the town near Kyiv and found what officials and witnesses say were the bodies of nearly 300 civilians killed by Russian troops.

Blinken would not confirm reports that the U.S. is facilitating the transfers of Soviet-era tanks to Ukrainian forces from eastern European allies, but says that there ""are or will soon be in Ukraine more than 10 anti-tank systems for every Russian tank.""

9:44 p.m. Bucha Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk shows journalists dead bodies in an area he says Chechen fighters controlled during the month that Russian forces occupied the Ukrainian city on the northern outskirts of Kyiv. One corpse appeared to have his hands bound by white cloth, and to have been shot in the mouth.

""The Russians have demonstrated that they were consciously killing civilians,"" Fedoruk alleges.

Reuters, which was taken to the scene by Ukrainian authorities, was not immediately able to verify the mayor's allegations. Russia's Defense Ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Chechnya is a region in southern Russia that has deployed troops to Ukraine to support Russian forces.

8:10 p.m. A leading rights group says it documented ""apparent war crimes"" committed by Russian military forces against civilians in Ukraine. Human Rights Watch says it found ""several cases of Russian military forces committing laws-of-war violations"" in Russian-controlled regions such as Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Kyiv.

The statement, published in Warsaw, comes one day after dead civilians were found lying scattered through the streets of Bucha, three days after the Russian army pulled back after a monthlong occupation of the area 30 km northwest of Kyiv.

7:16 p.m. Ukrainian grain exports in March were four times less than February levels, due to the Russian invasion, the economy ministry says. March grain shipments overseas included 1.1 million tons of corn, 309,000 tons of wheat and 118,000 tons of sun oil. Ukraine was the world's fourth-largest grain exporter in the 2020-21 season, according to International Grains Council data, with most of its commodities shipped out via the Black Sea.

7:00 p.m. Allegations of attacks against civilians during Russia's invasion of Ukraine must be investigated as war crimes, British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says, adding that the U.K. will fully support any such move by the International Criminal Court.

""As Russian troops are forced into retreat, we are seeing increasing evidence of appalling acts by the invading forces in towns such as Irpin and Bucha,"" Truss says in a statement, referring to places near Kyiv. ""Their indiscriminate attacks against innocent civilians during Russia's illegal and unjustified invasion of Ukraine must be investigated as war crimes.""

2:15 p.m. Russian naval forces continue to blockade the Ukrainian coast on the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, preventing resupply by sea, British military intelligence says.

1:00 p.m. Missiles struck Ukraine's southern port city of Odessa in the early hours of Sunday, the city council says in an online post. One of the city's ""critical infrastructure facilities"" was hit, regional administration spokesperson Sergey Bratchuk tells Ukraine's public broadcaster.

6:29 a.m. Russian forces want to seize east and south Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says in a late night address, adding Western nations had not provided enough anti-missile systems in their aid. Ukraine's president also heaps praise on his forces defending Mariupol, saying the fierce resistance in the besieged port city was giving the country's other cities valuable time.

4:27 a.m. Ukrainian military reports Russia is sending soldiers to Moldova's breakaway region of Transnistria, where they were preparing to launch ""provocations"" along the border, near Odessa, the Financial Times reports.

Russian troops already in Transnistria were preparing for ""a demonstration of readiness for the offensive and, possibly, hostilities against Ukraine,"" says the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

Moldova's Foreign Ministry says it is unaware of a troop buildup while officials in Transnistria deny the reports as ""completely untrue.""

3:35 a.m. Ukraine says it has seized back all areas around Kyiv, claiming complete control of the capital region for the first time since the invasion.

We had thought that invasions of other countries, savage street fighting and atomic threats were grim memories of a distant past,"" the pope says in an address to Maltese officials after arriving on the Mediterranean island nation for a two-day visit.

""However, the icy winds of war, which bring only death, destruction and hatred in their wake, have swept down powerfully upon the lives of many people and affected us all.""

A statement released by the Russian side says that Putin thanked Turkey for its assistance in hosting another round of Russia-Ukraine talks.

11:00 p.m. Friday's European Union-China summit, the first since Russia invaded Ukraine, was ""not business as usual"" and took place in a ""very sober atmosphere,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says.

""We also made very clear that China should, if not support, at least not interfere, with our sanctions,"" von der Leyen tells a news conference.

The onset of the pandemic in 2020 led to a surge in remote working and learning, which in turn fueled demand for computers.

4:00 p.m. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has recalled his country's ambassadors to Georgia and Morocco, suggesting they haven't done enough to persuade those countries to support Ukraine and punish Russia for the invasion.

Meanwhile, Washington says there are indications Vladimir Putin may be receiving inaccurate information from commanders.

""We have information that Putin felt misled by the Russian military, which has resulted in persistent tension between Putin and his military leadership,"" White House communications director Kate Bedingfield tells reporters in a briefing.

The United States and the European Union plan to impose stiff new sanctions against Russia in retaliation for its “war crimes” in Ukraine after revelations of atrocities in towns near Kyiv, including the discovery Tuesday of six burned and blackened corpses.

The new penalties by the U.S. and its allies, which will be announced Wednesday, include a ban on new investment in Russia and are intended in part to ""impose acute and immediate economic harm on Russia.""

The European Union’s executive branch on Tuesday proposed a ban on coal imports from Russia, in what would be the first sanctions targeting Moscow's lucrative energy income for its war in Ukraine. The coal imports amount to an estimated 4 billion euros ($4.4 billion) per year.

""Today we are proposing a 5th package of sanctions. To take a clear stand is crucial for the whole world,"" the E.U. Commission said in a Twitter post. ""A clear stand against Putin’s war of choice. Against the massacre of civilians.""

►French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Tuesday there is a “total determination” from all 27 E.U. countries for more severe sanctions targeting oil and coal. Europe’s dependence on Russian oil, natural gas and coal had left energy sanctions off the table amid fears the entire continent could plunge into recession.

Six charred bodies the latest grisly discovery in Bucha

The evidence of heinous acts committed in the towns around the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv gets more horrific by the day.

On Tuesday, Associated Press journalists saw six burned and blackened corpses piled together just off a residential street near a playground, the latest gruesome scene to emerge from Bucha as world leaders push for Russia to be held accountable.

One charred body had arms raised in supplication, the face contorted in a scream. The skull of another had a bullet hole in the left temple. A child's small, blackened foot could be seen in the tangle of bodies.

The circumstances regarding their death remain a mystery, but they join the growing list of atrocities discovered after Russian troops withdrew from the areas around Kyiv.

While Russian officials deny responsibility and claim the abhorrent images seen worldwide were staged, eyewitness accounts, journalists' reports and satellite imagery confirm a tale of unspeakable savagery committed upon civilians young and old.

“It’s horrible,” said Ukrainian Interior Minister Denys Monastyrsky at the scene.

Pentagon pledges anti-tank missiles

The Pentagon announced late Tuesday that $100 million worth of Javelin anti-tank missiles will be sent to Ukraine to meet an urgent need, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement.

The missiles have helped Ukrainian forces mount a fierce, effective resistance to Russian troops who invaded Ukraine in late February.

The White House has sent $1.7 billion in military aid since then.

Biden to ban investment in Russia as part of new sanctions package

The Biden administration will announce new sanctions Wednesday that include a ban on new investment in Russia in response to atrocities in Ukraine, among them recent revelations of barbaric acts in the town of Bucha that “show further evidence of war crimes,” according to sources familiar with the decision.

The penalties, made in coordination with G7 and European Union allies, also involve increased sanctions on financial institutions and state-owned enterprises and also on Russian government officials and their family members.

A Biden administration official said the measures are designed to “degrade key instruments of Russian state power, impose acute and immediate economic harm on Russia, and hold accountable the Russian kleptocracy that funds and supports Putin’s war.”

As a result of sanctions on Russia following President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, Russia’s economy is forecast to contract as much as 15% or more in 2022, according to the official.

“The financial system in Russia is near the brink of collapse,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said, defending the effectiveness of sanctions to date. “It is more and more difficult for President Putin to fund this war every single day. That has an impact.”

Biden on Monday called for a war crimes trial for Putin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy detailed the carnage in towns around Kyiv during an address to NATO on Tuesday, accusing Russian troops of killing “entire families, adults and children.”

Milley urges US to build new bases in Eastern Europe

The U.S. should establish permanent bases with rotating forces in new Eastern European locations as a hedge against Russian aggression, the top U.S military officer told Congress on Tuesday.

Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the bases could be funded by other countries such as Poland and the Baltic nations — Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania -- that want more U.S. troops to provide protection from Russia. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said any effort to expand security in Eastern Europe is a “work in progress” that probably will be discussed at the NATO summit in June.

“I believe that a lot of our European allies, especially those such as the Baltics or Poland and Romania, and elsewhere — they’re very, very willing to establish permanent bases,'' Milley said. ""They’ll build them, they’ll pay for them.”

Zelenskyy urges UN to punish Russia for war crimes

In his address to the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reiterated that Russia had committed war crimes and said the U.N. must hold Russia leaders accountable to show other potential war criminals ""how they will be punished if the biggest one is punished.""

He also called for soldiers who savagely attacked civilians – and those who issued the orders – to face trial for the apparent massacre by Russian forces in and around Kyiv and other major cities.

The Russian military killed ""anyone who served our country,"" Zelenskyy said Tuesday. Women were shot outside their homes as they searched for friends and loves ones, he said, and some were raped in front of their children. Zelenskyy reaffirmed that Ukrainian forces that retook cities found mass graves, revelations of atrocities and infrastructure destroyed by Russian forces.

""They killed entire families, adults and children, and they tried to burn their bodies,"" said Zelenskyy, who urged the U.N. to provide security guarantees to Ukraine. Since Russia holds veto power, though, the Security Council will be unable to act.

However, there is growing momentum in Europe to ban Russian coal, and possibly to impose sanctions on imports of its oil and natural gas, which could deliver a major blow to the struggling Russian economy.

Ukraine says satellite images reveal brutality of Russian forces

Satellite images taken weeks ago of the town of Bucha outside Kyiv show bodies of civilians on a street, undercutting the Russian claims that Ukrainian forces staged the scene when they retook the city, Reuters reported.

Maxar Technologies provided nine images taken of Bucha on March 18, 19 and 31 to Reuters, and at least four of the images appear to show bodies on the street. Ukraine forces took back the city last week.

Ukraine says 410 dead civilians were found in Kyiv-area towns recently retaken from Russian forces. In Bucha, 280 people were buried in mass graves, according to Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The Ukrainian prosecutor-general’s office has described one room discovered in Bucha as a “torture chamber.”

Zelenskyy told the U.N. Security Council that satellite images show what really happened during the attacks on Bucha, adding, ""we can conduct full and transparent investigations.""

Atrocities near Kyiv fuel global outrage. Will it be a tipping point in the war?

Human Rights Watch: Russia using banned mines

Russian forces are using banned anti-personnel mines as they pull back from cities in Ukraine, a Human Rights Watch report says.

Russia is using a device known as the Pom-3 Medallion, a mine capable of killing people within a 50-foot radius, Human Rights Watch said.

The 1997 International Mine Ban Treaty prohibits the manufacture and use of antipersonnel mines. Ukraine is one of 164 nations that signed the treaty. The United States and Russia have not signed it.

""They are mining all this territory,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video address. ""Mining houses, equipment, even the bodies of killed people. Too many tripwire mines, too many other dangers."" Read more here.

1.2 billion global citizens left vulnerable by war's disruption

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres addressed the Security Council before Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday, saying the world is ""dealing with a full-fledged invasion"" in violation of the U.N. Charter.

The result: More than 10 million Ukrainians have fled their homes and more than 4 million of them have fled the country.

The war's victims, Guterres said, also include more than 1.2 billion citizens of developing nations struggling with rising prices and other economic issues aggravated by the war.

""It is more urgent by the day to silence the guns,"" Guterres said.

Website links Ukraine refugees with hosts around the globe

A group of Harvard University students have created a website to help Ukrainian refugees find housing around the world.

Ukrainetakeshelter.com, created by Avi Schiffmann and Marco Burstein, encourages everyone with space in their homes to post a listing. Refugees and hosts must provide identity verification either through government issued ID card or passport. Over 18,000 prospective hosts have signed up on the site. On a recent day, Burstein and Schiffman logged 800,000 users.

Burstein said he, Schiffman and Irish software engineer Daniel Conlon have been ""blown away"" by the response.

“We’ve heard all sorts of amazing stories of hosts and refugees getting connected all over the world,” Burstein said. “We have hosts in almost any country you can imagine from Hungary and Romania and Poland to Canada to Australia.""

State Department calls atrocities part of a 'broader, troubling campaign'

The credible reports of torture, rape and civilian executions in Ukraine are probably not the acts of rogue soldiers, State Department spokesman Ned Price said Monday.

'“They are part of a broader, troubling campaign,” he said at a State Department briefing.

Price said the world has been shocked by “the horrifying images of the Kremlin's brutality” in Bucha and other cities near Kyiv. Civilians, many with their hands tied, were apparently executed in the streets.

Others were dumped in mass graves. As they’ve retreated, Russians have also left behind land mines and booby traps to injure more Ukrainians and slow recovery, Price said.

The apparent atrocities will be one of the topics of discussion when Secretary of State Antony Blinken meets with his NATO counterparts in Belgium this week.

Allies are already discussing additional sanctions and ways to help Ukraine document war crimes for a criminal prosecution, Price said. The U.S. has contributed both money and manpower to help Ukraine’s prosecutor general compile a case.

German president admits mistakes with Russia

Germany’s president is admitting mistakes in policy toward Russia in his previous job as foreign minister. President Frank-Walter Steinmeier served twice as foreign minister, most recently from 2013 to 2017, and pursued dialogue with Russian President Vladimir Putin to cultivate energy ties. Russia provides Germany with about one-third of it oil and gas and more than half its coal.

Ukraine and Polish officials have criticized Steinmeier for being too close to Russia. Ukraine's ambassador to Berlin boycotted a peace concert with Russian artists organized by Steinmeier.

Steinmeier told ZDF television Tuesday that “we failed on many points,” including efforts to encourage Russia toward democracy and respecting human rights.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said fresh sanctions from the West would not be ""enough"" to respond to the atrocities Ukrainians say have been committed in the town of Bucha, near Kyiv, where grisly images purportedly show slain civilians.

""There will definitely be a new sanctions package against Russia,"" Zelenskyy said in a video address Sunday night. ""But I'm sure that's not enough,"" he said as he made an impassioned plea for a stronger international response to Russia's invasion.

Residents of Bucha have accused Russian forces of targeting civilians in a deadly campaign that Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk said left more than 300 people dead before troops pulled out of the city. Russia's Defense Ministry has denied the claims, calling them a ""provocation,"" despite photographs and video showing damaged city streets strewn with dead bodies.

Meanwhile, in southern Ukraine, heavy fighting has continued in the besieged port city of Mariupol, according to Britain's defense ministry. It said as efforts to evacuate residents from the besieged city were set to continue Monday.

As Russian forces have retreated around Kyiv, Ukrainian forces have gained ground in the country’s northeast and south. The southern city of Mariupol has been encircled and under siege by Russian troops for weeks, but has not been captured. Neither has another southern coastal city, Mykolaiv, also a target of Russian attacks. Dueling artillery battles have become the norm as infantry forces on both sides dig in.

But even though Russia was plagued by low morale, logistical problems and casualties, its units, for the most part, did not surrender en masse or flee.

The Russian failure boiled down to one point, analysts said: doing too much at once.

“Eventually it became clear their initial campaign was a completely unworkable military strategy,” Mr. Kofman said. “They were competing along axes of advancement, and they were basically advancing in opposite directions on the way. There was no way they were going to succeed.”

'Failing that, the only option left to us is to put the predators to sleep,' he said, describing it as 'the only option'.

'It is unimaginably painful to talk about this, but the main priority now is the lives of people.'

He added on a video: 'After yesterday's massive shelling by missiles and planes, the [zoo] is practically destroyed.

'One more shelling - and the lions, tigers, bears, distraught with fear, may be free and go towards Kharkiv or to nearby villages,' said zoo owner Alexander Feldman (pictured)

Mr Feldman said that 'after yesterday's massive shelling by missiles and planes, the [zoo] is practically destroyed'

The zoo owner added that he will try to save 'the little jaguars' and 'little panthers' if possible

'The aviaries have been destroyed. All the infrastructure has been destroyed.

'By some miracle, the tigers and lions have survived. Their cages are badly damaged.

'By tonight, we will decide either to put the bears to sleep or move them. If there are any ideas, maybe we will save some and try to save the little jaguars.

'Maybe we will save little panthers. But all the other animals are likely to be destroyed.'

The owner of the popular zoo said: 'Feldman Ecopark no longer exists. Now this can be said quite definitely.

'Yesterday and today it was again subjected to massive shelling and bombardment. Infrastructure destroyed, enclosures destroyed.'

Shelling on 17 March killed two two orangutans and chimpanzees. Two days later nine deer were slaughtered and 20 escaped to the woods.

Last week a video showed kangaroos being transported to a new home from Feldman Ecopark.

A van driver fleeing with the frightened kangaroos had said: 'It is one month since the war began and we keep evacuating the animals.'

'These kangaroos are already safe,' said the zoo. 'This is very good, because their enclosures, unfortunately, were repeatedly shelled. We believe that now they will be fine.'

A statement said: 'Many thanks to volunteers and employees who take risks to save animals, as well as to our many friends - caring people, businesses and non-governmental organisations who help us financially and make our rescue operations possible.

'Your support truly saves lives.'

A van driver fleeing with the frightened kangaroos had said: 'It is one month since the war began and we keep evacuating the animals'

While the kangaroos were saved from Feldman Ecopark, sadly some have been killed in the attacks.

'We cannot avoid tragedies,' a spokesman said at the time. 'Four fallow deer and three Welsh goats became victims of another barbaric shelling.

'The list of victims of aggression among our pets is growing - it already includes large cats, primates, ungulates, marsupials, and birds...Feldman Ecopark has been on the line of fire for the last month.'

The zoo once had more than 300 species.

It comes as the Ukrainian emergency services posted photos of dead animals in Chernihiv, suggesting domestic creatures were killed by Russian troops as shells littered the region.

The post said: 'Chernihiv region, our land is unhappy...Shells in every cellar, in every nook and cranny...Poor demilitarized domestic dogs and cows that did not threaten anyone.'

'Unlike us humans, animals do not feel hatred for these creatures that came to our Ukraine for one purpose only. And even they, these cows and dogs, were destroyed.

'This is the whole Russian army - killing women, children, animals.'

The White House referred to the weapons in a fact sheet on the aid package as “100 Tactical Unmanned Aerial Systems.” NBC News reported exclusively Tuesday that this move was under consideration.

There are two variants of the weapon, the Switchblade 300 and the 600, that have been sold to U.S. Special Operations Command by manufacturer AeroVironment, based in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. The 300 is designed for pinpoint strikes on personnel, and the larger 600 is meant to destroy tanks and other armored vehicles. The Congressional officials did not have clarity on which variant would be provided to Ukraine, or whether both would be.

NBC News reported on an exclusive demonstration of the Switchblade 300 in December. AeroVironment officials said at the time that the government forbade them from demonstrating the 600.

AeroVironment officials did not respond to requests for comment.

“We stand with our allies and sovereign nations in their right to protect their homelands and their very lives when this fundamental right is threatened,” the company said in a statement on its website headlined “AeroVironment stands with the people of Ukraine and all of NATO.”

The Switchblades are essentially robotic smart bombs, equipped with cameras, guidance systems and explosives. They can be programmed to automatically strike targets miles away, and they can be steered around objectives until the time is right to strike. The company says the 600 can fly for 40 minutes and up to 50 miles.

They are single-use weapons, which is why they have been dubbed “kamikaze drones.” But they are orders of magnitude cheaper than the Hellfire missiles fired by U.S. Reaper drones. The 300 can cost as little as $6,000, by some estimates.

Both weapons can be set up in minutes and launched from tubes. They fly much faster than the Turkish Bayraktar TB2 drones that Ukraine has been using to inflict damage on Russia, and presumably they would be able to penetrate the spotty air defenses Russia is maintaining over its forces.

If the Switchblade is used in Ukraine, it would be the most significant use of the weapon in combat to date. The U.S. military used the Switchblade in combat under limited circumstances in Afghanistan and elsewhere but has not publicized that fact, sources familiar with the matter have said.

Many questions remain about the proposed arrangement with Ukraine, including how many of the missiles the U.S. has in its stockpiles, how fast AeroVironment can manufacture new ones and how much training Ukrainians would require to operate the systems.

The United Kingdom is the only foreign country that so far has been authorized to purchase the Switchblade.",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/ukraine-asks-biden-admin-armed-drones-jamming-gear-surface-air-missile-rcna20197

Ukraine's military published several videos it says show its prized Bayraktar TB2 drones at work destroying targets controlled by Russian forces.

Over the weekend, the Ukrainian army commander-in-chief's Facebook page posted five clips showing the strikes, though giving little detail of the exact locations or targets.

The drones have been hailed as a game-changer by the Ukrainian military, and have been credited with destroyed large numbers of Russian armored vehicles, gaining heroic status among the Ukrainian people.

The videos have been keenly recieved, amassing some 1.2 million Facebook views as of Monday, with many reposted on other networks to vast audiences. Insider was unable to verify the footage, or the named targets.

The first, dated March 12, purported to show the destruction of a Russian electronic warfare system near Kyiv.

""Our Bayraktar TB2 operators masterfully 'tested' the enemy's electronic warfare system in the Kyiv region,"" said its caption.

The footage appears to have been taken with a camera held close to a monitor screen, a common format for Ukraine's Bayraktar videos. Someone's reflection could be seen and a buzz of chatter was also recorded.

Another 18-second video posted on Saturday said one of the drones had destroyed a multiple rocket launcher.

""Bayraktars in action!"" the post said. ""Hundreds of saved lives of our fellow citizens, especially civilians!""

Later that day, a third video post claimed a Bayraktar had taken out a Russian army command post:

Neither of those videos gave a location.

A final video dated March 13 claimed to show the destruction of an artillery fire control point — a system to coordinate and direct ranged weapons.

Ukraine had between five and 20 of the drones in service before the invasion, according to The New York Times.

The drones can reach altitudes of 25,000 feet and fly for 27 continuous hours, per their manufacturers.

They can be operated remotely from up to 300 km away, with each one capable of bearing four laser-guided bombs or rockets, for a total payload of some 150 kilograms.

The first video was shared online on Sunday morning and appears to show rockets being fired at three armoured vehicles in the Ukrainian south-eastern city of Mariupol.

The aerial footage, which was circulated by several unverified accounts, shows a BTR-82 APC and KamAZ-63968 'Typhoon' vehicle being targeted successfully. It is not clear when the strike took place.

The BTR-82A is an advanced 8x8 wheeled armoured personnel carrier (APC) being manufactured by in Russia for use by the armies of Russia and Kazakhstan.

The second video footage was also shared online on Sunday and shows a drone strike on a Russian command centre in southern Ukraine.

The footage was released by the Ukrainian Army who said it shows the Russian command and control center destroyed near Vasylivka, in the Mykolaiv region by a Bayraktar drone.

It is unknown if or how many casualties there were involved in both strikes on Russian forces.

It comes as Russia escalated attacks in western Ukraine on Sunday with a deadly airstrike on a military base where Ukrainian troops had trained with NATO forces, bringing the conflict closer to Poland and prompting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to renew his pleas for a no-fly zone.

Zelenskyy called Sunday a 'black day,' and said none of the activities at the military base would have threatened Russian territory.

Explosions have been heard on the outskirts of the western Ukrainian city of Lviv after Russian forces launched an attack on a military base just 12 miles from the Polish border, killing at least nine people and injuring dozens more.

According to Ukrainian sources, Vladimir Putin's forces had launched a missile strike on the International Center for Peacekeeping and Security, also known as Yavoriv military complex, just before 6am this morning.

Initial reports suggested the base had been targeted by eight missiles, but Maksym Kozytskyi, Governor of the region later confirmed 30 cruise missiles had been fired, killing 35 people and injuring 134.

An American journalist was also killed Sunday and another injured when their vehicle came under fire from Russian forces outside Kyiv.

Meanwhile, continued fighting in multiple regions caused more misery throughout Ukraine and has provoked international outrage.

Now in its third week, the war has forced more than 2.5 million people to flee Ukraine. Thousands of civilians and soldiers have been killed.

Meanwhile, the death toll in the strategic southern port city of Mariupol, facing acute deprivation amid a prolonged siege, has topped 2,000, officials there said.

Efforts continued to get help to Mariupol, which aid agencies say is facing a humanitarian catastrophe.

A humanitarian column headed there had to turn back again on Sunday, a city official said, after the Russians 'did not stop firing'.

A total of 2,187 residents have now died in days of relentless Russian bombardment, the city council said Sunday.

'The enemy is holding the city hostage by performing real acts of genocide,' said Ukraine Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov.

Zelensky has accused Moscow of both blocking and attacking humanitarian convoys, although he said Sunday that another 125,000 people had been evacuated that way across Ukraine.

'Russians are bombing the city even during official negotiations,' Defence Minister Reznikov said. 'They have no dignity, no honor, no mercy.'

Talks between the two sides have yet to yield a ceasefire, but Ukrainian and Russian representatives will meet via video-conference Monday, a Zelensky adviser and a Kremlin spokesman both said.

'And our goal is that in this struggle, in this difficult negotiating work, Ukraine will get the necessary result... for peace and for security,' Zelensky said early Monday.

'We see significant progress,' Leonid Slutsky, a senior member of Russia's negotiating team, told state-run television network RT Sunday.

It comes after the Ukrainian President visited wounded soldiers at a military hospital in Kiev on Sunday to boost their morale and award them medals for their bravery.

'Guys, get well soon. I believe that the best gift for your statement will be our common victory!' said Zelensky, according to an English translation of a tweet posted by the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine.

The Ukrainian government and military forces have shared a number of videos and images showing significant damage inflicted on Russian troops with Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2s during the war in Ukraine. Now the Russian Ministry of Defense has followed suit and also released several of their own videos showing Russian drones being used for reconnaissance, surveillance, and offensive purposes in Ukraine.

On the eighth day of the war, the Russian Ministry of Defense posted the first verified drone footage to its social media account. The command and observation post of the Aidar battalion, an assault battalion of the Ukrainian Ground Forces, was hit by a Kornet (9M133FM-3) ATGM-like missile fired by a Russian-made Orion-E MALE UCAV, according to a video released on March 4. The footage also revealed that the Orion-E UCAV’s electro-optical sensor had poor image quality and that the sensor remained inactive for some time after the ordnance detonated.

The Russian Federation’s Ministry of Defense released the second piece of footage showing a drone destroying a target in Ukraine on March 11. A structure described by the defense ministry as “the fortified castle of Ukrainian nationalists” was hit by a Russian Aerospace Forces drone in the footage. While the ministry stated that the drone hit the target with precision-guided munitions from a height of around 4 km, it did not specify which drone fired it.

On March 13, the Russian Ministry of Defense released additional footage of a Ukrainian multiple launch rocket system being destroyed, possibly with the Forpost-R, a drone developed from Israel’s IAI Searcher II. “A multiple launch rocket system was destroyed by a Russian Air Force unmanned aerial vehicle using high-precision munitions from a height of over 3,000 meters,” was the statement from the Russian Ministry of Defense.

Although the ministry claimed that a Ukrainian MLRS was destroyed, the quality of the footage makes this difficult to corroborate. Probably for this reason, the Ministry’s footage shows a pair of PGMs (precision-guided munitions) mounted under the Forpost-R drone’s two wings upon takeoff, but no ordnance during landing.

Aside from videos showing Russian drones being used offensively, the Russian Ministry of Defense also provided footage of drones being used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. In drone footage posted on March 11, the ministry claimed that Ukrainian nationalists prevented the evacuation of cars carrying civilians from the city via the humanitarian aid corridor. On March 13, the ministry released footage of a Russian Armed Forces artillery strike during the destruction of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ field command post with a Krasnopol high-precision shell. The footage released by the ministry on March 14, possibly taken from an Orlan-10 drone showed the destruction of MLRSs belonging to the Ukrainian Armed Forces and a Ukrainian ammunition depot by a missile strike.

According to official and unofficial videos and images, Russia has used Orion-E UCAVs developed by Kronstadt Group in Russia, the Russian licensed version of Israel’s IAI Searcher II UAV, Forpost-R UAVs, Russian made Orlan-10 UAVs for reconnaissance and electronic warfare, short-range Eleron-3 UAVs designed by the Russian industry, and KUB-BLA kamikaze UAVs in Ukraine.

So far, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense has stated that Russia has lost a total of ten drones, but no official announcement has been made concerning the drone models. According to unconfirmed photographs from the army, the drones that were shot down were mostly Forpost-R, Orlan-10, and KUB-BLA kamikaze drones. A Russian drone was allegedly shot down by Ukrainian air defenses after ‘flying into Polish airspace’ in violation of NATO territory, according to 24 TV News. Poland has yet to issue an official statement regarding the incident. Because Poland is a NATO member, a violation like this might result in a substantial escalation of the current crisis.

Despite having far more drone command and control capabilities and experience than Ukraine, Russia has seemingly struggled to effectively coordinate these systems in the war in Ukraine. While our picture of the conflict and the weapon systems in use is relatively incomplete the Russian Ministry of Defense’s footage does not appear to be sufficient to compete with Ukraine’s successful TB2 drone campaign.",https://www.overtdefense.com/2022/03/15/russia-releases-footage-of-drones-being-utilized-in-the-war-in-ukraine/

The Bayraktar TB2 combat drone has earned its spurs in the skies over Ukraine – thrilling the operators while taking out tanks and artillery pieces – plus other armored vehicles.

The Ukrainian military has released numerous black and white videos that appear to come from the Bayraktar’s camera. This footage shows the drone’s missiles hitting paydirt in spectacular explosions that then go viral. The unmanned vehicle looks to continue to bring the fight to the Russians and make their invasion even more costly.

Additional Targets Beyond Armored Vehicles

If the videos on social media are indeed authentic, it is evidence that the Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 is playing an expanding role in the war. New footage is showing the drone attacking bridges and Russian command and control centers, not just tanks and armored vehicles.

Positive Psychological Effects of Successful Drone Strikes

Military analysts have noticed that the drone’s success can give a boost to Ukrainian morale and also dismay and frustrate the Russians due to their failures in air defense.

Time interviewed Arda Mevlütoğlu, a Turkish military and aerospace analyst. He replied that the “footage released by the Ukraine military shows serious defects in Russian air defense cover, which is a surprise for many observers. The footage is also very useful for public relations and psychological warfare.”

The Russians are continuing to use unprotected convoys of support and logistics vehicles to supply the front lines and the Bayraktar TB2 is eliminating these trucks that are carrying fuel, ammunition, and food.

Bayraktar Drones Are Popular Around the World

The Ukrainians have an estimated 50 drones that they have bought since 2019. They are made by Turkish defense firm Baykar Technology and more of the combat drones have been ordered by the Ukrainians since the invasion. 16 countries have bought the unmanned vehicle.

The Bayraktar carries four Smart Micro Munition laser-guided missiles. It can remain in the air for up to 30 hours and flies at altitudes from 18,000 to 25,000 feet. The range of the drone is 185 miles. It’s not a fast aircraft, flying at only 80 miles per hour. It has two different kinds of cameras plus laser range-finders and laser pointer.

The Unmanned Vehicles Have Survivability

Surprisingly, the drones have not been as detectable to Russian air defenses. As Saikiran Kannan of India Today has described it, “Key aspects like low visibility and detectability, thanks to the low radar cross-section values of the TB2 and the ability to have the datalink complexes stay below the electromagnetic jamming envelopes of principal Russian electronic warfare systems like Krasukha-4, have made the TB2 drones slick and agile,” Kannan wrote.

The Bayraktar is having success, but the Ukrainians need more of the drones. Additional operators must be trained to pilot the aircraft. New units will likely be deployed around Kyiv and other besieged cities.

While drones have been utilized by the United States for targeted assassinations against individual leaders during the war on terror, this is one of the first times, outside the Azerbaijan and Armenia matchup in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, that unmanned conflict has been decisive in mechanized maneuver war.

Are Tanks Becoming Obsolete?

This is a significant development in 21st-century warfare, and it is making the use of main battle tanks almost obsolete as they struggle against anti-armor portable missiles and drone strikes. The Russians will have to improve their performance of early warning radar and anti-aircraft systems to reduce the effectiveness against drone attacks. But it appears now that the Bayraktar is winning.

The alliance has repeatedly refused the request out of fear that this would mean engaging in a direct confrontation with Russia. Yet, with dozens of Ukrainians being killed by Russian aerial attacks each day, there are still many ways in which NATO can help Ukraine protect itself.

Firstly, Ukraine desperately needs fighter aircraft, as Russia has a significant advantage in military aviation. The simplest option would be to transfer Soviet-era Su-27 and MiG-29 fighters to Ukraine, dozens of which are in service in Poland, Bulgaria, and Romania. NATO countries are currently discussing this but, unfortunately, have not yet provided aircraft to Ukraine. This appears to be because Ukraine’s eastern European allies are unwilling to weaken their own air forces. Therefore, the United States can now increase its deployments of fighter jets to Poland, Bulgaria, and Romania to address their concerns and clear the way for them to transfer aircraft to Ukraine. In any case, it will be important for NATO to deploy more combat aircraft on its eastern flank to deter further Russian aggression.

Polish MiG-29 fighters can help compensate for the losses the Ukrainian Air Force has suffered due to Russian missile attacks on its bases. Ukrainian pilots have proven their ability to protect their airspace with fighter jets (including MiG-29s): Ukrainian Air Force Command reports that its fighters have shot down more than a dozen Russian aircraft during the first two weeks of the war.

Ukraine also needs more anti-aircraft missile systems and man-portable air defence systems (MANPADS). The former will help the country protect critical military and civilian infrastructure from Russian bombers flying at high altitudes, as well as missiles. The latter will help it protect Ukrainian troops and cities from Russian helicopters, fighters, and bombers that are flying at low altitudes in an attempt to evade air defence systems.

While Ukraine is already receiving Stinger MANPADS from its Western partners, it will need more of these so that it can use them on all fronts. But the country is still waiting to receive anti-aircraft missile systems. It would likely take the Ukrainian military too long to learn to use NATO anti-aircraft systems and to solve the technical issues of integrating them into its forces. And NATO would see it as too risky to deploy its own personnel to operate these systems. Accordingly, the alliance can provide Ukraine with Soviet-era S-300 air defence systems from Slovakia and Greece. The Ukrainian army has successfully used S-300s against Russian aircraft and missiles many times.

Ukrainians hope that their Western friends will continue to supply Ukraine with anti-tank missile systems such as Javelins and Next Generation Light Anti-tank Weapons, as well as ammunition for these systems. Thanks to these portable anti-tank missiles, some of which were handed to Ukraine before the large-scale Russian invasion, Ukrainian troops contained an onslaught of Russian armoured vehicles: by 15 March, Russia had reportedly lost 404 tanks and 1,279 armoured protected vehicles. But Russia still has many more tanks, armoured personnel carriers, and infantry fighting vehicles. So, Ukrainian forces need the tools to destroy them – especially given that the Kremlin is trying to win simply by deploying huge numbers of vehicles and soldiers on every front.

Ukraine has also used unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to great effect. This is particularly true of its dozens of Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2s – which have caused significant damage to Russian forces, as one can see from the numerous videos of Ukrainian UAV strikes online. But the Ukrainian army will need more combat UAVs if it is to cover every front effectively and to destroy Russian air defences, artillery, and support columns on a large scale.

The Ukrainian military also needs to accelerate its programmes to train soldiers to use other types of UAVs that are in service with NATO countries. If the war becomes a protracted conflict (as seems likely), the alliance can supply Ukraine with significantly more UAVs. These systems would allow Ukraine not to risk the lives of so many soldiers in combat missions. The protection of personnel is an important part of the strategy of the Ukrainian Armed Forces – which, unlike the Russian military, do not use soldiers as cannon fodder.

Overall, the quickest and easiest step for NATO countries would probably be to transfer their Soviet-era weapons to Ukraine. Post-communist NATO countries in central and eastern Europe have a significant number of artillery pieces, armoured vehicles, mortars, and small arms dating back to Soviet times. Many of them no longer need these weapons. Ukrainian soldiers would not need additional training to use these weapons.

As it stands, many more Ukrainians want to defend their country than have the weapons to do so. Territorial defence units suffer from a shortage of small arms and a total lack of armoured vehicles. Therefore, a simple transfer of Soviet-era weapons from NATO countries would significantly increase Ukraine’s ability to resist the Russian offensive.

At the same time, NATO members that are not ready to supply Ukraine with weapons can provide ammunition, bulletproof vests, helmets, and modern means of secure communication. They can also supply Ukraine with night-vision devices, which might be especially useful given that Russian forces have proved to be vulnerable to night attacks.

Ukraine desperately needs fighter aircraft, as Russia has a significant advantage in military aviation

Ukrainians greatly appreciate all the military assistance that the West continues to provide to Ukraine. That support played a huge role in breaking the Kremlin’s blitzkrieg and inflicting significant losses on Russian forces. However, the Russian military has far more manpower and equipment than Ukrainian forces, especially in military aviation. Therefore, NATO countries will need to markedly increase their supplies of arms, including advanced weapons systems, to Ukraine. Ukrainians will require greater military support from the West if they are to ensure that this is the last war of its kind in Europe.

23,5f670b8d-94d6-48df-b643-a8f1d0ad776e,[],2022-04-06 00:00:00,"M AN-PORTABLE AIR DEFENCE SYSTEMS (MANPADS) are playing an unexpectedly important role in the war in Ukraine. These shoulder-fired missiles, typified by the American Stinger, are only effective against low-flying aircraft and at a range of a few kilometres. But they have scored a number of kills and are severely impeding Russian air operations. Now Ukrainian forces are getting an upgrade, in the form of the latest STARStreak missiles supplied by Britain. Why are MANPADS crucial to Ukraine’s defence, and what difference might the new missiles make?

Military analysts were puzzled when Russia failed to knock out the Ukrainian network of long-range, radar-guided S-300 surface-to-air missiles at the outset of the war. Though some have been destroyed, other S-300s continue to operate, forcing Russian aircraft to fly at low altitudes to avoid radar detection. And whereas NATO helicopters have mast-mounted sights that allow them to fire guided missiles from long range, Russian attack helicopters tend to carry pods of unguided rockets, behaving like slower ground-attack aircraft that must fly forward while attacking. Both of these factors put Russian aircraft in the sights of MANPADS.

Originating in the 1950s, MANPADS use infra-red seekers to home in on the hot exhaust pipes of jet engines. This is why aircraft and helicopters fire out fans of decoy flares, to distract such missiles with brighter and more attractive heat sources. Early MANPADS could only lock on to an aircraft from behind. These include the Soviet-era Strela (or SA-7, as NATO calls it) which Germany is supplying to Ukraine from old East German stocks. More modern missiles, such as the Igla (or SA-18) and the Stinger (which was developed in the 1980s), can be fired at an aircraft from any direction. However they may not be fast enough to catch a receding aircraft before it disappears out of range.

Modern heat-seeking missiles also have limitations. The Stinger missile seeker requires cooling, and a battery unit provides power for only 45 seconds, so it cannot be left continuously ready. The seeker head takes between three and five seconds to reach operating temperature after being turned on, an agonising delay when under attack. Once the Stinger is live, the weapon must identify the aircraft’s engine heat and lock on. And once fired, the missile may be thwarted by decoy flares or other countermeasures, or the pilot may manage to break the lock-on by pulling a sharp turn. A Stinger flies at about twice the speed of sound and carries a one-kilo explosive warhead fused to explode on impact. That is not necessarily enough to destroy an aircraft but almost certainly enough to force it back to base.

The battlefield effectiveness of the Stinger is highly contested. Its main use in action was by mujahideen in Afghanistan in their fight against the Soviet Union. Their reports of a 79% success rate may have been intended to convince their American backers to keep supplying the weapons. The reality may have been more like 20%.

The STARStreak is somewhat different. Ukraine received its first one in mid-March. Whereas the Stinger is battle-proven, this will be STARStreak’s debut in combat. The weapon was developed in the 1980s, though the latest version, STARStreak II, was first demonstrated in 2008. STARStreak is unusual in not being a heat-seeker but a “beam-rider”: the operator holds the target in the cross-hairs and the missile follows, guided by a laser beam. A disadvantage is that the operator has to follow the target. But that makes it in effect immune to decoys, countermeasures and evasion. If you can see it, you can hit it.

STARStreak’s makers call it a “high-velocity missile” to draw attention to its speed of more than Mach 3, which makes it much harder to evade. And rather than Stinger’s single warhead, STARStreak releases three tungsten darts, each weighing 900 grams. These spread out and fly in formation, all following the laser guidance, increasing the chance of a hit. The darts can pierce helicopter armour and explode after penetration, causing far more damage than a surface explosion.

It may be that this ultra-modern weapon proves too complex or fails to match expectations. However, reports from Ukraine suggest that a STARStreak has already brought down a Russian Mi-28 helicopter. Ukraine’s government has repeatedly asked NATO to impose a no-fly zone. It will almost certainly not get one. But STARStreak missiles, and MANPADS more generally, could help Ukrainian forces to neutralise Russian airpower without the need for new jets or direct intervention by other states.

BBC News Published 18 March

Image source, Getty Images Image caption, A Ukrainian soldier holding a Javelin anti-tank missile system during exercises in 2021

The burnt-up wreckage of a Russian tank lies in the dirt, while in an accompanying photo next to it, a Ukrainian soldier carries the armaments said to have caused the destruction.

The images posted to Twitter by the Ukrainian Armed Forces are labelled with a triumphant caption, declaring that this was the result of ""hits from Javelins on [Russian] military equipment"".

The Javelin, a shoulder-held anti-tank weapon that shoots heat-seeking rockets hurtling towards targets up to 4km (2.5 miles) away, can be controlled by a portable unit that doesn't look much different from a video game console - but can send a metre-long projectile straight through the side or top of an armoured tank.

The very presence of the American-made weapons ""causes panic"" among Russian troops, the Ukrainian military claims - and it is about to get 2,000 more of them.

Javelin missiles are among the items promised to Ukraine by the US in a new $800m (£608.3m) military assistance package announced by President Joe Biden on Wednesday.

Other armaments include drones that can be turned into flying bombs and anti-aircraft weapons that can shoot helicopters from the sky.

But will these shipments help Ukraine overcome Russia's more numerous - and better equipped - invasion force?

What will the US send to Ukraine?

The new US aid for Ukraine includes a wide range of military equipment, ranging from 25,000 sets each of body armour and helmets to rifles and grenade launchers, thousands of other anti-tank weapons and more than 20m rounds of ammunition.

Besides Javelin missiles, the most powerful weapons include 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems, once famously used to shoot down Soviet planes in Afghanistan.

The US also plans to ship 100 ""tactical unmanned aerial systems"" - small drones - which are often hand-launched and small enough to fit into rucksacks.

Soldiers can use them to scope out the battlefield or, in some cases, to attack, essentially creating flying bombs that can be flown into targets from a distance.

Mr Biden's announcement on Wednesday brings the total amount of US military aid pledged for Ukraine to $1bn in the past week alone - a huge acceleration when compared to the $2.7bn provided between 2014 and the start of 2022.

It is a ""significant development"" and addresses previous shortfalls, according to John Herbst, a former US ambassador in Kyiv.

""There's no question that [Biden] and his team have been too timid in providing support for Ukraine,"" Mr Herbst said. ""And they have responded to that pressure.""

What will this mean against Russian ground and air offensives?

Military experts say that the US-supplied anti-tank weapons are likely to have the most impact in Ukraine.

The invading Russian forces ""are primarily mechanised forces"" - meaning armoured convoys - so ""the best thing you can do is take them [vehicles] out"", said former US Army Colonel Christopher Mayer.

Ukraine has received a variety of anti-tank systems from several countries, which helps increase the ""lethality"" of Ukraine's forces against Russian vehicles, Mr Mayer said.

""If you give them a variety of anti-tank systems, it provides them with multiple opportunities to punch through whatever particular defensive armour protection systems that tank has,"" he said.

And while their claims can't be independently verified, Ukrainian officials say they are putting the weapons to good effect. As of 16 March, they claim to have destroyed more than 400 tanks and over 2,000 other Russian vehicles.

Anti-tank weapons, however, do nothing to help Ukraine combat Russia's air force, which for three weeks has been striking targets across the country.

The man-portable, shoulder-fired Stinger system is the only anti-aircraft weapon included in the US aid package.

The system has been seen in conflicts around the world since 1981. It was most famously used in Afghanistan, where US-supplied Stingers helped bring down hundreds of Russian aircraft and helicopters during the Soviet occupation.

Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Ukrainian Ministry of Defence image of a Russian helicopter being shot down by its forces early in March.

It is effective against low-flying helicopters or aircraft at up to about 3,800m (12,400ft), making it relatively useless against higher-flying Russian bombers.

Mr Herbst said that the administration's mention of Stingers as part of the aid package to Ukraine is a ""sign of weakness"".

""They do need more Stingers, there's no doubt about that,"" he said. ""But they need higher altitude anti-aircraft weapons as well…that's a serious omission.""

What has the US not sent?

While the White House has hinted that higher-altitude weapons - such as the Soviet-era S-300 anti-aircraft missile - might be headed to Ukraine via third countries, no formal announcement has been made.

Officials in Slovakia have expressed a willingness to send the systems to Ukraine, provided they receive replacements. Two other Nato allies - Greece and Bulgaria - also reportedly have the systems.

The US has also dismissed proposals to have Poland transfer its Mig-29 fighter jets to Ukraine to allow them to do more to contest the skies.

US officials have described the plan as not ""tenable"" due to the increased risk of open conflict between Nato and Russia.

Mr Mayer, however, said that the transfer of Mig-29 or similar jets by US allies - with the administration's blessing - would be an effective way of helping Ukraine fight for control of its skies.

He noted that the Soviet Union provided both aircraft and pilots to North Vietnam to operate against US aircraft without starting a wider confrontation.

What have other countries done?

The US isn't alone in providing military aid to Ukraine. At least 30 other countries have provided help, including €500m ($551m) from the European Union, a historic first.

After the US announced the new assistance package, however, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that ""more support"" was urgently needed.

""Even more than we get now,"" he said, calling for ""air defence systems, aircraft [and] enough lethal weapons and ammunition to stop the Russian occupiers"".

Mr Mayer said he believes that the US weapon supplies pledged to date are perhaps only enough to allow the Ukrainians to ""die heroically"".

""We must be more aggressive about giving them what we have,"" he said. ""We should at least give them the same quality, and quantity, of stuff as the Soviet Union gave to North Vietnam during our war with them.""

Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Ukrainian soldiers unloading US-made Javelin anti-tank weapons just weeks before Russia's invasion on 24 February

Mr Herbst said that additional assistance packages will ""probably"" be needed in the future - and that they'll only be effective if they allow Ukraine to challenge Russia's air force.

""The key to me is whether or not we're sending something that hits Russian air assets at 30,000 feet or above,"" he said.

While no firm announcements have been made thus far, President Biden vowed that more help will be on the way - and that the US is working to help Ukraine acquire the longer-range air defence systems it needs, without providing details.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60774098

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Footage released by the Russian MOD early on Mar. 14, 2022, proves once again how sturdy the Sukhoi Su-25 Frogfoot can be. The clip shows the aircraft taxiing with significant damage reportedly caused by a MANPADS (Man Portable Air Defense System) that hit the jet on the rear right hand side of the fuselage.

Indeed, IR-homing missiles usually hit the engine nacelle/rear fuselage area where the temperature of the exhaust plume is higher and the Su-25 is not new to such events. There are plenty of photos and stories you can find online of Frogfoot aircraft that survived direct hits of 9K38 Igla, Stinger and other MANPADS during conflicts all around world. Anyway, today’s images are a reminder of both the impressive damage tolerance of the Su-25 and the threat posed to all Russian aircraft operating at medium and low altitude over the battlefields by the MANPADS operated by the Ukrainian forces.

Since the beginning of the Russian invasion, at least six Su-25s have been confirmed lost in Ukraine.

Dealing with the most recent event, the Russian MOD posted a video that shows the extent of the damage to the Su-25SM (that according to some sources was operating from an airfield in Belarus).

﻿

There’s also a brief account of the incident (that you can find roughly translated here below):

While performing a combat mission in the zone of a special military operation, the Su-25 attack aircraft, which is second in the pair, was hit by a missile from a man-portable air defense system fired from the ground by a serviceman of the armed forces of Ukraine. The pilot of the damaged aircraft, assessing the situation, decided to turn off the damaged engine and not leave the aircraft. The pilot of the leading (first) plane, Lieutenant Colonel Denis Litvinov, realizing that the comrade’s plane could not withstand a second missile hit, covered it with his own plane. The pilot of the second aircraft visually detected the launch of the second missile and, firing off flares, managed to divert the missile to the side. During the landing approach, the pilot of the damaged Su-25 reported an avionics and control systems failure, but managed to land thanks to the assitance provided by the pilot covering him. The landing was uneventful. Thanks to the cold-blooded and skillful actions of the pilot Denis Litvinov, he managed to save the life of his friend and the combat aircraft. Both pilots are presented for state awards.

The Sukhoi Su-25 Grach (Russian for “Rook”), NATO reporting name Frogfoot, is a single-seat, twin-engine jet attack aircraft developed in the Soviet Union to provide CAS (Close Air Support) for the Soviet Ground Forces. The first prototype took to the air for the first time in February 1975. They were used in the Afghan and Ossetia theatres, in the Russia – Georgia conflict, back in 2008 as well as in Syria where they were first deployed in 2015.

Considered an equivalent to the U.S. A-10 Thunderbolt II CAS aircraft, the Soviet-design is smaller but more heavily armoured than its American counterpart, with as much as 1,100 kg of titanium armor compared to the 540 kg of the A-10. Nevertheless, in both types the pilots sit in a titanium aircraft armor, referred to as a “bathtub,” which protects the cockpit from rounds fired from below.

Both were designed and built with survivability in mind: almost everything in the jets is duplicated, so as to make them as durable as possible. In the A-10, there are two tails, two hydraulic systems, two engines which are positioned on the outer side of the fuselage so as to minimize the risk of fire in case one of the two turbofan engines is hit. In fact, just like the Russian Su-25, the “Warthog” is a pretty tough plane too, that has also shown its special ability to bring the pilot back in spite of heavy damages by ground fire.

If there is one thing to describe how the Russian armed forces performed at the start of the war in Ukraine, it’s probably sloppy. Going back years ago, the U.S. managed to pull-off a smooth and quick occupation of Afghanistan. Later on, Iraq fell to the Coalition Forces, and the world witnessed precision and surgical bombings of command and controls, and an almost unhampered advance of armors to its capital.

In the case of the Russian invasion of Ukraine this 2022, things are different.

In fact, how the Russian military handled the invasion is a complete opposite, as if the anti-thesis of the precise, clean and quick operations of the Coalition Forces.

When the war broke, the world was expecting a fast collapse of Ukraine. Russia probably expected the same thing, until their planes and helicopters began falling from the sky. The intimidating armored units of Russia became prey for Ukraine’s MANPADS, with the Javelin Weapon System gaining infamy as effective tank buster. Then, there is the unexpectedly stiff Ukrainian resistance. Russia was probably caught off-guard by the tenacity of the Ukrainian forces, and the invasion never went according to plan. More than the week since it started, Russia only captured a few cities, while the massive armored convoy stalled. Observers blamed the great invasion stalls to a number of factors, with arrogant and poor planning as one of them. And as people pointed out, Russia will be facing its second Afghanistan even if they managed to take Ukraine. But as the war continue, the Javelin isn’t the only weapon system ravaging the Russian military. Ukraine also operates a small fleet of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles capable of both reconnaissance and combat. The Turkish made Bayraktar TB2.

Drones Are no Toys

Israeli IAI drone.

Modern UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) are more than just glorified radio-controlled toys one could get at the hobby stores. Flying in long periods, at great distances and guided not just by radio control isn’t something a regular model plane can do. Plus, modern UAVs could accomplish what science fiction have been warning us. To kill.

Sending an unmanned airborne vehicle wasn’t a new idea. Way before the birth of heavier than aircraft, the Austrians tried to use pilotless balloons to blow Venice in July 1849. These killer balloons were launched from the ground, or from a ship, much like the modern UAV. Yet being balloons with no steering mechanisms, the plan failed miserably when the wind blew them off course. Yet that doesn’t stop the world powers from developing their unmanned flying vehicles, and in the Second World War, the Germans unleashed perhaps the first robot vehicle that could kill. The V-1 flying bomb. Development continued after the war, with drones being used for training practices and surveillance. And it was the Israeli who demonstrated the effective use of modern drones, when it uses the IAI scouts to help neutralize the Syrian air defense. Nevertheless, watching the enemy was the primary use of the drones back then. But drones started to carry weapons.

Targeted Killings

A Predator UAV.

Like many of the UAVs, the MQ-1 Predator was made for long endurance reconnaissance missions. Later on, it began to carry designators for laser guided bombs from manned aircrafts, further expanding its role. And that same laser designator is used for AGM-114 Hellfire. Eventually, an armed version of the Predator came out, this time armed with the said missile under its wings.

And since the introduction of the Buzz Bombs, UAVs have the capabilities to kill.

The armed UAV was involved in various conflicts, but it became infamous for targeted killings. A robot sent to assassinate an individual is the stuff of action movies, but that’s exactly what happened. The Predator, and other UAV versions hunted and killed Al Qaeda leaders. Drones have advantages like being silent, hence they could approach undetected before unloading their missiles. And one of its victims is Abu Khayr al-Masri, and Egyptian Al Qaeda leader.

And fast forward to the Russian Invasion of Ukraine, another UAV is adding to the woes of the already stalled Russian armors.





The Turkish Bayraktar TB2

The Bayraktar TB2.

When dealing with a massive Russian convoy, the Ukrainians resorted to various anti-tank weapons. The Javelins and NLAWs are part of the arsenal, and up in the air, a Turkish-made armed drone delivers its load of laser guided missiles.

The Bayraktar TB2, which means “flag bearer” in Turkish is a medium altitude, high endurance UAV. It could be remotely controlled or flown autonomously, with monitoring by the ground crew. The Turkish military is the main operator, but other countries also owned a fleet. On the outside, it uses a blended wing and body design and an inversed V tail. The internal combustion engine (105 horse-power) that powers the drone sits between the tail boom. The drone is controlled by three operators (pilot, payload operator and mission commander) in a NATO based shelter, equipped with cross redundant command and control system. The drone could fly at 80 mph, and armed with four laser guided missiles. Being a long flyer, it could loiter at 24 hours, at the height of 25000 feet. Overall, it’s lighter compared to the MQ-9 Reaper. And with its low purchasing (less than 10 million dollars) and maintenance cost, the said drone is the Kalashnikov rifle of the UAV world.

Lake many of its contemporaries, the drone saw actions in conflicts, like counterterrorism and Syrian Civil War. And recently, Ukraine used it in great effects against Russian armors.

The Damages

Destroyed Russian tanks.

Ukraine owned 20 of these drones, and still ordering more. And before the Russian Invasion of Ukraine, drones were never used against a major military power. The deployment of the Bayraktar TB2 marked the first time UAVs are used to fight such a powerful opponent. As the war in Ukraine continues, Russia’s poor planning was greatly exploited through the drone’s deployment.

The problem is that Russia failed to secure air superiority over Ukraine. The air defense established by the Russians is equally sloppy. Though it was believed that Russia owned a large number of S-400, the drone somehow managed to elude their air defenses. Possibly, Russia never had enough defenses to protect its convoy. And with minimal threats in the air, the Bayraktar TB2 is free operate. Armed with the UAV, Ukraine managed to carry-out dozens of successful missions. The result is blown vehicles and casualties in the Russian side. The drone also played a role in the stall of the Russian armored convoy, after it destroyed a fuel train.

Ukraine’s success in repelling Russia’s initial plan for a lightning advance and capture of Kyiv and other major cities owes much to its army’s consistent ability to target and destroy vehicles, inflicting both heavy losses and large delays to advancing convoys.

Often armed only with shoulder-launched, portable rocket launchers — thousands of which have been provided by western countries since the invasion began — small groups of Ukrainian troops have used their terrain and Russia’s tactics to their advantage, and helped lead a resistance that has surprised even Kyiv’s closest backers in the west.

The compact weapons used by Ukraine and the heavy artillery relied upon by Russian troops form the backbone of the contrasting tactics employed by both sides.

Russia’s battalion tactical groups

One of the main outcomes of a root-and-branch overhaul of the Russian armed forces that culminated in 2012, the battalion tactical group is the primary fighting unit of the country’s army. The US estimates that 100 of Russia’s roughly 170 BTGs — designed to be both quickly adaptable and possess high levels of firepower — have been deployed in Ukraine.

Armed with tanks, howitzers, artillery and air defence systems, they were envisaged as multi-theatre operators, with the ability to shift from rapid assault to long-range attacks and support operations for other units.

But their heavy reliance on vehicles — roughly 75 in each — and relatively low numbers of just 200 infantry troops makes them particularly vulnerable to attacks on their flanks or rear. That is especially true in a war where the terrain, the tactics and the level of Ukrainian military capabilities mean the BTGs are not fighting against similarly deployed and armed units.

Russian vulnerabilities

Planned by Russian president Vladimir Putin among a tiny group of advisers, the invasion of Ukraine was a shock to many of the Russian troops deployed on the country’s border for “exercises”.

That meant the vehicles abruptly ordered to cross the border were in a poor state of maintenance and often with low quality tyres or spare parts, according to western intelligence officials and defence analysts. That made off-road manoeuvrability risky or impossible, as the large number of photos of Russian equipment abandoned in mud-clogged fields or with ruptured tyres or axles attest.

In addition, Vladimir Putin’s plan called for a rapid attack and capture of key cities like Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol. That meant moving quickly down major roads and fighting for control of major junctions, rather than provincial towns or countryside areas.

Ukrainian troops drew two conclusions. First, they realised that no matter how large an armoured column was, it would only be as wide as the road, and could only move as fast as the front vehicles. And second, defending troops realised they could operate relatively freely in the forests, fields and villages along the sides of the road.

With little Russian infantry cover on their flanks, Russian vehicles proved vulnerable to ambushes from small teams of Ukrainian troops, picking off targets from cover that could then hide their retreat.

Javelins

Key to these ambushes has been the widespread use of troop-carried, shoulder-fired anti-tank missiles, such as the US-made Javelin.

They were sent to Ukraine before the invasion began to allow troops to be taught by western military instructors how best to use them, and are now arriving in their thousands from countries all across the Nato alliance. Ukrainian and western officials have said those supplies are a critical backbone of resistance to the invasion.

Its compact size makes it easily transportable by fast-moving infantry, while the missile’s tracking system means it can be fired-and-forgotten, allowing troops to quickly leave the location of attack before the projectile has even struck its target. A double warhead also allows it to inflict serious damage on reinforced Russian tanks.

Other videos have shown troops using rocket-propelled grenades — lighter but less powerful and harder to aim — or one-man next generation light anti-tank weapons to achieve the same outcome.

Air war

Western intelligence officials broadly agree that one of Russia’s most costly military mistakes stemmed from its failure to destroy both Ukraine’s air force and its air defence systems in its initial barrage of precision-guided cruise missiles in the opening hours of the invasion.

That failure meant Russia did not gain air supremacy in the skies above the battlefield, a position it has used to devastating effect in Syria, for example.

In addition, the use of shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles by Ukrainian troops to successfully attack Russian helicopters and low-flying fighter jets in support of ground forces has deepened Moscow’s reticence over deploying too much air power alongside advances. That has reduced both its surveillance and attack potential.

Russia has lost at least 28 aircraft and helicopters so far in the invasion compared to just 10 from Ukraine’s air force, according to the Oryx blog, which uses open source photography to compile its data.",https://www.ft.com/content/f5fb2996-f816-4011-a440-30350fa48831

March 13 (Reuters) - Russia has asked China for military equipment since its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, the Financial Times and Washington Post reported on Sunday, citing U.S. officials.

U.S. National Security advisor Jake Sullivan will be in Rome on Monday to meet with China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi, the White House said earlier.

Russia, which calls its action in Ukraine a ""special operation,"" and China have tightened cooperation as they have come under strong Western pressure over human rights and a raft of other issues.

Beijing has not condemned Russia's attack and does not call it an invasion, but has urged a negotiated solution.

The White House's National Security Council declined to comment.

The Washington Post said the unidentified U.S. officials did not state the kind of weaponry that had been requested or how China had responded.

Summary

The UN says at least 596 civilians have died since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including 43 children. A further 1067 have been injured.

Three UN agencies are calling for an immediate end to attacks on health care facilities.

The fourth round of talks between Russia and Ukraine is due to start at 9.30pm New Zealand time.

Multiple media outlets are reporting Russia is asking China for military and economic help.

Russia has effectively cut Ukraine off from maritime trade after establishing a distant blockade of the Black Sea coast, the UK says.

8.45pm: That concludes live updates from day 19 of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Breakfast will have the latest developments from Ukraine from 6am on TVNZ1 and OnDemand.

8.35pm: Australia and the Netherlands taking legal action against Russia over the downing of MH17 through the International Civil Aviation Organization.

MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine in 2014. It killed all 298 people onboard, including 38 Australians.

From the AAP:

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison says the legal action was a major step forward in truth and accountability for a ""horrific"" act of violence.

""The Russian Federation's refusal to take responsibility for its role in the downing of Flight MH17 is unacceptable and the Australian government has always said that it will not exclude any legal options in our pursuit of justice,"" Morrison says in a joint statement.

Australia and the Netherlands will rely on ""overwhelming"" evidence that the flight was brought down by a Russian missile in eastern Ukraine, an area that was under the control of Russian-backed separatists.

ADVERTISEMENT

The missile belonged to Russia's 53rd anti-aircraft military brigade, and was accompanied by a trained Russian military crew.

Both countries said the evidence showed the missile could only have been fired by the trained Russian crew, with the missile system later returned to Russia shortly after the incident.

Russia withdrew from negotiations with Australia and the Netherlands in October 2020 about MH17.

Russia did not return to the negotiating table, despite repeated requests from Australia and the Netherlands.

8.30pm: From the Associated Press:

Russian forces fired artillery strikes on suburbs northwest of Kyiv overnight and targeted points east of the capital, the head of the Kyiv region says.

A town councillor for Brovary east of Kyiv was killed in fighting there, regional administration chief Oleksiy Kuleba says on Ukrainian television.

ADVERTISEMENT

He also reports strikes overnight on the northwest towns of Irpin, Bucha and Hostomel, which have seen some of the worst fighting in Russia’s stalled attempt to take the capital.

The general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces say that Russian troops have not made major advances over the past 24 hours, despite expanding strikes to the west.

Ukrainian forces are targeting Russian bases, targeting their logistical abilities, the general staff say in a statement on Facebook.

The general staff accused Russian forces of setting up firing positions and military equipment in churches and other civilian infrastructure so that Ukrainian forces can’t fire back. The accusation could not be immediately verified, though Associated Press reporters have seen Russian armoured vehicles in residential areas.

8.25pm: The fourth round of talks between Russia and Ukraine is due to start in just over an hour, at 9.30pm New Zealand time.

Earlier, Zelensky adviser Mykhailo Podoliak says Russia ""is starting to talk constructively"" and seems more ""sensitive to Ukraine's position"".

Russia previously said it would not back down on its so-called military operation unless Ukraine did the following:

8.12pm: The BBC reports that, according to Ukrainian authorities, Antonov Airport in northern Kyiv has been hit by Russian shelling.

7.48pm: The UK's Ministry of Defence says 2.5 million people have been forced from their homes because of the invasion.

7.25pm: Pregnant woman, baby die after Russia bombed maternity ward

ADVERTISEMENT

From the Associated Press:

A pregnant woman and her baby have died after Russia bombed the maternity hospital where she was meant to give birth, The Associated Press has learned.

Images of the woman being rushed to an ambulance on a stretcher had circled the world, epitomising the horror of an attack on humanity’s most innocent.

In video and photos shot on Thursday by AP journalists after the attack on the hospital, the woman was seen stroking her bloodied lower abdomen as rescuers rushed her through the rubble in the besieged city of Mariupol, her blanched face mirroring her shock at what had just happened. It was among the most brutal moments so far in Russia’s now 19-day-old war on Ukraine.

The woman was rushed to another hospital, yet closer to the frontline, where doctors laboured to keep her alive. Realising she was losing her baby, medics say she cried out to them: “Kill me now!”

Surgeon Timur Marin found the woman’s pelvis crushed and hip detached.

ADVERTISEMENT

Medics delivered the baby via cesarean section, but it showed “no signs of life,” the surgeon says.

Then, they focused on the mother.

“More than 30 minutes of resuscitation of the mother didn’t produce results,” Marin says.

“Both died.”

Accused of war crimes, Russian officials claim the maternity hospital had been taken over by Ukrainian extremists to use as a base, and that no patients or medics were left inside.

Russia’s ambassador to the UN and the Russian Embassy in London calls the images “fake news"".

Associated Press journalists, who have been reporting from inside blockaded Mariupol since early in the war, documented the attack and saw the victims and damage firsthand. They shot video and photos of several bloodstained, pregnant mothers fleeing the blown-out maternity ward, medics shouting, children crying.

7.08pm: An apartment block in Kyiv is on fire after shelling, according to videos and images from Ukraine's State Emergency Service.

According to authorities, two people were found dead and three were hospitalised.

6.56pm: The latest developments from the US from 1News correspondent Anna Burns Francis:

6.26pm: CNN reports that the World Health Organization is worried that fighting in Ukraine could make the Covid-19 pandemic worse.

ADVERTISEMENT

WHO says it is trying to limit the spread of the virus, but that there is a risk that it could be passed around the more than 2 million people who have fled Ukraine.

There is also concern that Ukraine and its neighbouring countries have low vaccination rates, meaning they may experience the virus more severely.

However, the executive director of WHO's health emergencies programme Dr Mike Ryan is warning against stereotypes of refugees and disease.

""Let us be very careful with our rhetoric because this always arises that in some way people fleeing the horrors of war are going to bring stuff with them. Europe has plenty of Covid as it stands, and it has got to deal with that, and Ukrainian refugees are not going to change the dial on that,"" he says.

Our World in Data statistics show 35 per cent of its population is fully vaccinated against Covid-19. Of its westward neighbours, where many refugees are heading to, Moldova has the lowest vaccination rate of 29 per cent, while Hungary has the highest at 66 per cent.

5.45pm: Mobil reduces fuel prices after New Zealand Government's announcement

ADVERTISEMENT

Following the Government's Monday afternoon announcement that it will be slashing excise duty on fuel by 25 cents per litre from 11.59pm for the next three months, Mobil says it is immediately reducing its prices across all its petrol grades by the same amount immediately.

Mobil lead country manager Andrew McNaught says the fuel company wants to do its part in helping reduce the rising cost of living.

“International fuel prices have kept rising as a result of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the sanctions imposed on Russia, [the] third-largest oil producer in the world.”

“Our product costs have risen significantly from the middle of December, and continue to rise. These costs on average have more than doubled since the beginning of December, and have increased more than 50 per cent in the last two weeks,"" McNaught says.

Meanwhile, the Government is warning petrol companies not to pocket the profits from the reduction of excise tax.

5.19pm: From the Associated Press:

More than two weeks into a war he expected to dominate in two days, Putin is projecting anger, frustration at his military’s failures, and a willingness to cause even more violence and destruction in Ukraine, in the assessment of US intelligence officials.

US officials in recent days have publicly said they're worried the Russian president will escalate the conflict to try to break Ukraine's resistance.

Russia still holds overwhelming military advantages and can bombard the country for weeks more.

And while the rest of the world reacts to horrific images of the war he started, Putin remains insulated from domestic pressure by what CIA Director William Burns calls a “propaganda bubble"".

Putin's mindset — as tough as it is to determine from afar — is critical for the West to understand as it provides more military aid to Ukraine and also prevents Putin from directly taking on NATO countries or possibly reaching for the nuclear button.

Intelligence officials over two days of testimony before Congress last week openly voiced concerns about what Putin might do. And those concerns increasingly shape discussions about what US policymakers are willing to do for Ukraine.

Burns is a former US ambassador to Moscow who has met with Putin many times. He told lawmakers, in response to a question about the Russian president's mental state, that he did not believe Putin was crazy.

ADVERTISEMENT

“I think Putin is angry and frustrated right now,” he said last week. “He’s likely to double down and try to grind down the Ukrainian military with no regard for civilian casualties.”

4.48pm: National leader Christopher Luxon has responded to the Government's announcement:

“Excise tweaks don’t fix wider cost of living crisis” - Luxon @1NewsNZ — Jessica Mutch McKay TVNZ (@MutchJessica) March 14, 2022

Meanwhile, the Greens say direct payments would have been better:

“The Green Party says direct payments to New Zealanders would have provided better support than a temporary cut in fuel tax.” - Greens @1NewsNZ — Jessica Mutch McKay TVNZ (@MutchJessica) March 14, 2022

4.36pm: Finance Minister Grant Robertson says he will be topping up the national land transport fund to compensate for the expected loss of revenue following the drop in excise tax.

Robertson says the amount of revenue the Ministry of Transport estimates that will be lost because of the reduction is $350 million for the three-month period.

Some money to fill that gap will be from the Covid response fund, especially considering the reduction in MIQ costs, he says.

4.15pm: NZ Government tries to ease Kiwis' pain at the pump

New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is announcing a number of changes to help Kiwis struggling with gas prices at the pump amid Russia's invasion.

For the next three months, the Government will reduce both the road user charges (RUC) and the excise duty on fuel by 25 cents per litre.

The latter would save motorists about $11.25 to $17.25 each time they filled their tank, compared to current prices, Ardern says.

ADVERTISEMENT

The drop in excise will come into effect from 11.59pm on Monday. However, the Government indicates there are some legislative and logistical restrictions that delayed the immediate reductions in RUC.

Ardern says the Government will also subsidise public transport by 50 per cent and expand public transport links. This will kick in on April 1 until the end of June.

She says New Zealand can't control the war, but it could take steps to help ease the burden of the ""wicked, perfect storm"".

She also says what's happening around the world is also a signal for New Zealand to continue its transition away from fossil fuels.

3.50pm: Australia is announcing fresh sanctions to target people connected to Moscow. Among those included in the sanctions is Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich and the CEO of energy corporation Gazprom Alexey Miller.

From the AAP:

ADVERTISEMENT

Abramovich was one of seven wealthy Russians targeted by the UK government in a further round of sanctions last week, which involved asset freezes, travel bans and an embargo on transactions with UK individuals and businesses.

Australia's latest round of sanctions also includes more than 30 Russian oligarchs, prominent business people and immediate family members.

""The sanctions reinforce Australia's commitment to sanction those people who have amassed vast personal wealth and are of economic and strategic significance to Russia,"" Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne says.

""Many of these oligarchs have facilitated, or directly benefited, from the Kremlin's illegal and indefensible actions in Ukraine since 2014.""

Ukraine's top diplomat in Australia accused Russia of instigating genocide as tanks deliberately target residential buildings.

Charge d'Affaires Volodymyr Shalkivskyi says fleeing through humanitarian corridors being offered by Russia has become risky because troops do not always honour the safe passage.

""We would like everyone who is on our side to send a strong message to Moscow that this kind of atrocity in the 21st century is not possible and Russia will pay the price,"" he tells Adelaide radio station 5AA.

ADVERTISEMENT

""We are determined to defend our country. There are no indications so far we can find compromise regarding peaceful resolution.""

Thousands of troops and civilians have been killed by Russian forces, including 85 children ranging from three months to 16 years old, the envoy says.

""This is genocide because hitting residential areas is a clear sign of genocide. Russia means to take out Ukrainian ethnicity from the map,"" Shalkivskyi says.

""They would like to integrate Ukrainians into Russia without allowing us to have our culture, our language and our history.""

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has spoken to his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte about Russian sanctions, military and humanitarian support for Ukraine as well as implications for the Indo-Pacific region.

Morrison also says the two countries will continue to pursue accountability for MH17, which was shot down over eastern Ukraine in 2014.

On March 2, Russia's Ministry of Defence said that 498 of its troops had been killed in Ukraine and 1597 more were wounded. Russia's military hasn't provided updated figures since.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says it is a “black day” after Russia shelled a military base in the western part of his country.

Zelensky says in his daily address that Russia fired 30 rockets at the Yavoriv military base. He says the attack killed 35 people and injured 134 injured others.

The base is less than 25 kilometres from the Polish border. Zelensky says he has given Western leaders “clear warning” of the danger to the base. He asks NATO leaders again to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine. He warns “it is only a matter of time” before Russian missals fall on NATO territory.

A military drone that apparently flew all the way from the Ukrainian war zone over three European NATO-member states before crashing in an urban zone of the Croatian capital was armed with an explosive device, Croatia’s defense minister said on Sunday local time.

The Soviet-made aircraft crossed Romania and Hungary before entering Croatia, slamming into a field near a student dormitory late Thursday. About 40 parked cars were damaged in the large explosion, but no one was injured.

6.20am: The first foreign journalist has died in the crossfire of the conflict. American journalist Brent Renaud was shot dead as he filmed refugees fleeing Irpin. Two other journalists were also shot and taken to hospital. A statement from Kyiv regional police said that Russian troops opened fire on a car, and that one journalist died.

Waves of Russian missiles pounded a military training base in western Ukraine on Sunday, killing 35 people in an attack on a facility that has served as a crucial hub for cooperation between Ukraine and the NATO countries supporting it in its defense against Moscow's grinding assault.

More than 30 Russian cruise missiles targeted the sprawling facility, which lies not far from the border with NATO member Poland and that has long been used to train Ukrainian military personnel, often with instructors from the U.S. and other countries in the western alliance.

5.55am: From the Associated Press

Three UN agencies are calling for an immediate end to attacks on health care facilities in Ukraine, calling them “an act of unconscionable cruelty.”

In a joint statement Sunday, the UN Children’s Fund, the World Health Organization and the UN Population Fund said that “horrific attacks are killing and causing serious injuries to patients and health workers, destroying vital health infrastructure and forcing thousands to forgo accessing health services despite catastrophic needs.”

“To attack the most vulnerable — babies, children, pregnant women, and those already suffering from illness and disease, and health workers risking their own lives to save lives — is an act of unconscionable cruelty,” they said.

Since the start of the war at least 12 people were killed and 34 were injured, while 24 facilities and five ambulances were damaged or destroyed, the agencies said.

They said that some 4300 children have been born since the conflict began and 80,000 Ukrainian women are expected to give birth in the next three months, with oxygen and other medical supplies running dangerously low.

“The health care system in Ukraine is clearly under significant strain, and its collapse would be a catastrophe. Every effort must be made to prevent this from happening,” they said.",https://www.1news.co.nz/2022/03/14/fourth-round-of-ukraine-russia-talks-imminent/

Publicité Lire la suite

Le site se nomme 1920.in et tire son nom d'une unité de pilotes polonais de la Seconde Guerre mondiale qui avait rejoint la Royal Air Force britannique pour poursuivre le combat contre Hitler après l'annexion de la Pologne. Le site a été créé par une équipe de développeurs polonais, se faisant appeler « la Squad303 » qui affirme avoir piraté plus de 20 millions de numéros mobiles de personnes et d’entreprises domiciliées en Russie, ainsi que 140 millions d’adresses de courriels appartenant à des citoyens et citoyennes, dans le pays.

We are 7 days old! 🎂 You sent 7,000,000 (Yes! Seven millions!) Text messages to randomly selected Russians via https://t.co/yI1zLytWYP ! Even in our dreams we didn't dream of such a result! Thank you people of the free world! We love you!♥️ #FightForUkraine ✌️🇺🇦 @YourAnonNews pic.twitter.com/xIosMhpstK — squad303 (@squad3o3) March 11, 2022

Concrètement, l’internaute accède à l’un de ces numéros qui sera affiché de façon aléatoire sur le site. Il lui suffit alors de recopier un texte pré-rédigé en russe pour l'envoyer depuis WhatsApp ou à partir de n’importe quel application SMS depuis un ordinateur, un mobile ou en passant directement par le site. Si, depuis ce lundi matin, Google a bloqué la traduction automatique de texte en russe pour limiter les actions de propagande en ligne du Kremlin sur son navigateur, vous pouvez toujours vérifier la teneur du message à l’aide de différents outils numériques. Notamment la nouvelle version du traducteur en ligne DeepL, qui s’utilise aussi facilement que celui du géant du web américain. Voici le contenu du message en français que vous proposent d’envoyer les Squad303 : « Chers Russes, vos médias sont censurés. Le Kremlin ment. Découvrez la vérité sur l'Ukraine sur l'internet gratuit et sur l'application Telegram. Il est temps de renverser le dictateur Poutine ! »

Depuis le lancement du service, Squad303 revendique plus de 7 millions de SMS qui ont été envoyés par son intermédiaire – et zéro selon les autorités de surveillance des télécoms russes ! Évidemment, le nombre exact des participants qui lancent ces missives du monde entier et surtout celui des personnes qui ont reçu ce type de message est, de toute façon, invérifiable.

This is crazy. The person questioned me being American so I had to prove it. I’ve sent over 200 messages thanks to @squad3o3 to Russian cell phones. This one got me, it roughly translates to “it’s terrible in Russia” @xxNB65 @YourAnonNews @xenasolo @ZelenskyyUa got a new friend🙏 pic.twitter.com/UOunxs2aIJ — Mr. T aka Masta Chef/CireX14 (@titancrawford1) March 6, 2022

Certains experts en cybersécurité estiment cependant que l’envoi de ces SMS exposerait leurs destinataires à des mesures répressives dans leur pays en vertu de la nouvelle loi russe qui sanctionne de quinze ans de prison toute « fausse information » sur la guerre en Ukraine. Notamment lors des contrôles intempestifs effectués par les forces de police russes sur les mobiles des citoyens avec l’affichage de ces textos susceptibles de les envoyer directement en prison.

Le groupe polonais Squad303, qui revendique soutenir les opérations de piratage des Anonymous, n’en est pas à son coup d’essai en annonçant, ce samedi, l'intrusion et le vol des données sur les serveurs informatiques du ministère du Développement économique de la Russie.

Une opération, semble-t-il, réussie, puisque les informations dérobées sont dorénavant affichées et publiées en ligne. La réaction des hackers russes a été immédiate. NetBlocks, le groupe de surveillance des réseaux internet et mobiles dans le monde, signalait ce dimanche que l’opérateur Vinasterisk, qui couvre l'ouest de l'Ukraine, a connu une panne massive. Le résultat d’une cyberattaque de grande envergure qui comprenait aussi des éléments de sabotage et de vol de données.

43,fdc0bda1-b744-4809-aa4b-c7abc85253dc,[],,"مع استمرار الهجوم العسكري الروسي على أوكرانيا، تتصاعد الحرب الإلكترونية المتعلقة بهذا الصراع مع دخول متطوعين رقميين من جميع أنحاء العالم في المعركة الافتراضية المفتوحة.

ووفقًا لفرع الأبحاث في شركة ""تشيك بوينت سوفتوير تكنولوجيز""، فإن عدد الهجمات الإلكترونية التي يشنها كلا البلدين بشكل مباشر أو بالوكالة منذ اندلاع الحرب؛ ""مذهل"".

وقال لوتيم فينكلستين، رئيس استخبارات التهديدات في الشركة: ""لأول مرة في التاريخ يمكن لأي شخص الانضمام إلى حرب"". وأضاف: ""نحن نرى المجتمع الإلكتروني بأكمله متورطًا، حيث اتخذ العديد من المجموعات والأفراد جانبًا، إمّا مع روسيا أو مع أوكرانيا"". وقال: ""هناك الكثير من الفوضى السيبرانية"".

انتفاضة إلكترونية

وفي الأيام الثلاثة الأولى التي أعقبت الهجوم على أوكرانيا، زادت الهجمات الإلكترونية ضد القطاعات العسكرية والحكومية الأوكرانية بنسبة 196%، وفقًا للشركة. كما أنها زادت بشكل متواضع مقابل المنظمات الروسية (4%) والأوكرانية (0.2%)، بينما انخفضت في الوقت نفسه في معظم أنحاء العالم الأخرى، وفقًا لبيانات الشركة، التي عرضتها شبكة ""سي أن بي سي نيوز"".

ومنذ ذلك الحين، تقدر السلطات الأوكرانية أن حوالي 400 ألف متسلل متعدد الجنسيات تطوعوا لمساعدة أوكرانيا، كما قال يوفال وولمان، رئيس شركة الأمن السيبراني ""سيبير بروف"" والمدير العام السابق لوزارة المخابرات الإسرائيلية.

وقال: ""تسبب المتطوعون على مستوى القاعدة الشعبية في اضطراب واسع النطاق - كتبوا على الجدران رسائل مناهضة للحرب على وسائل الإعلام الروسية وتسريب البيانات من عمليات القرصنة المتنافسة"". وأضاف: ""لم نشهد أبدًا هذا المستوى من المشاركة من قبل جهات خارجية لا علاقة لها بالنزاع"".

وبعد ثلاثة أسابيع، تستمر أوكرانيا في تحمل وابل من الهجمات عبر الإنترنت، يستهدف معظمها حكومتها وجيشها، وفقًا لبيانات في ""تشيك بوينت سوفتوير تكنولوجيز"".

ونفت موسكو باستمرار أنها تشارك في حرب إلكترونية أو تدعمها. وفي 19 فبراير/ شباط، قالت السفارة الروسية في واشنطن عبر تويتر: ""إنها لم تقم مطلقًا ولا تقوم بأي عمليات خبيثة في الفضاء الإلكتروني"".

⚠️ Confirmed: Major internet disruption registered on the Vinasterisk network which serves #Vinnytsia Oblast, western #Ukraine; the operator reports a massive cyberattack with elements of sabotage 📉 📰 Background: https://t.co/S0qJQ7CbNv pic.twitter.com/Zq9ZQdZZDn — NetBlocks (@netblocks) March 13, 2022

وقال فينكلشتاين: ""إن بيانات الشركة تظهر أن الهجمات على روسيا انخفضت خلال الإطار الزمني نفسه"". وقال: ""إنه قد تكون هناك عدة أسباب لذلك، من بينها الجهود الروسية للحد من ظهور الهجمات أو زيادة الأمن للدفاع ضدها"".

جيش أوكرانيا التقني

وكهدف قديم للهجمات الإلكترونية الروسية المشتبه بها، ترحب أوكرانيا على ما يبدو بالمساعدة الرقمية.

وبناءً على طلب نشره الوزير الرقمي الأوكراني ميخايلو فيدوروف عبر تويتر، انضم حوالي 308000 شخص إلى مجموعة ""تليغرام"" المعروفة باسم ""جيش تكنولوجيا المعلومات في أوكرانيا"".

وقال أحد أعضاء المجموعة، جينادي غالانتر، المؤسس المشارك لشركة تكنولوجيا المعلومات ""بروفيكتوس"": ""إن المجموعة تركز على تعطيل المواقع الروسية ومنع التضليل وإيصال معلومات دقيقة إلى المواطنين الروس"". وأضاف غالانتر: ""إن لديه مشاعر مختلطة بشأن المشاركة"".

وأحد الأساليب التي تستخدمها المجموعة هو توزيع هجمات رفض الخدمة، والتي تحاول جعل المواقع المستهدفة غير قابلة للوصول من خلال إغراقها بحركة المرور عبر الإنترنت.

اعتبرها غالانتر، الذي فرّ من الاتحاد السوفييتي عام 1991 وزوجته روسية، ""أعمال شغب""، ولكن في الوقت نفسه، أفاد بأنه يشعر بأنه مضطر للمساعدة في القيام بدوره في ""إيصال الحقيقة وإنكار الأكاذيب"".

ويتخوف غالانتر من أن تكون الجهود الحالية غير كافية بمواجهة القدرات الإلكترونية الروسية، ومن احتمال رفض جهود المجموعة باعتبارها دعاية أوكرانية أو غربية أو وصفها بأنها آلة تضليل من النوع الذي يزعم أنه يقاتل ضده.

انتقام موسكو

وبحسب ""سي أن بي سي نيوز""، فمن المتوقع على نطاق واسع أن موسكو وأنصارها سوف ينتقمون من البلدان التي تقف إلى جانب أوكرانيا، وربما من القائمة المتزايدة للبنوك والشركات التي تنسحب من البلاد.

ويحذر الخبراء من أن الرد المتبادل قد يؤدي إلى ""حرب إلكترونية عالمية"" بين روسيا والغرب.

ويُعتقد أن روسيا كانت وراء العديد من الهجمات الرقمية ضد أوكرانيا في الأسابيع التي سبقت الهجوم، ولكن منذ ذلك الحين أظهرت روسيا ضبط النفس، ""على الأقل في الوقت الحالي""، وفقًا لما ذكره وولمان، رئيس شركة الأمن السيبراني ""سيبير بروف"".

ومع ذلك، فإن التقارير التي تتحدث عن الغضب المتزايد داخل الكرملين بشأن العقوبات الجديدة، والتي تفاقمت بفعل الإخفاقات العسكرية الروسية في أوكرانيا؛ قد تجعل الحرب الإلكترونية واحدة من ""الأدوات"" القليلة المتبقية في كتاب قواعد اللعبة الذي وضعه بوتين، على حد قوله.

ويعتقد أن الرد السيبراني سيكون الإجراء الروسي المضاد الأكثر ترجيحًا.

عمليات تجسس ضد أوكرانيا

وكشفت ""غوغل"" المملوكة لشركة ""ألفابت"" الأسبوع الماضي، أن قراصنة إنترنت روسًا معروفين لدى خبراء أمن الإنترنت منخرطون في عمليات تجسس، يشنون هجمات إلكترونية على أهداف أوكرانية وأخرى تابعة لحلفاء أوروبيين لأوكرانيا.

وقالت مجموعة تحليل التهديدات التابعة لشركة ""غوغل""، والتي تركز على التصدي لعمليات القرصنة الإلكترونية وتحذر المستخدمين بشأنها، الإثنين الفائت: إنّ ""وحدة التسلل الروسية ""فانسي بير"" والمعروفة أيضًا باسم ""إيه.بي.تي28"" ترسل رسائل بريد إلكتروني زائفة لشركة أوكرنت الإعلامية الأوكرانية"".

وحسب ""غوغل"" فإن الهدف من إرسال رسائل بريد إلكتروني زائفة هو سرقة بيانات دخول المستخدمين كي يستطيع القراصنة استهداف أجهزة كمبيوتر وحسابات على الإنترنت.

صراعات أخرى

ويمكن للحرب الأوكرانية الروسية أن تؤجج نزاعات إقليمية أخرى طويلة الأمد. فقد أعلنت شركتان تكنولوجيتان تايوانيتان ناشئتان هما ""أوتوبوليتيك"" و ""كيو سيرتش""، الأسبوع الماضي عن تقديم مساعدة تقنية مجانية لأوكرانيا و""النشطاء الأوكرانيين على الإنترنت في جميع أنحاء العالم"" لمواجهة الدعاية الروسية على وسائل التواصل الاجتماعي.

وقال روجر دو، مؤسس ""أوتو بوليتيك""، عبر بيان صحفي: ""لكوني تايوانيًا عاش في ظل دعاية مستمرة وتهديدات بالهجوم من جيراننا القريبين، أشعر بعلاقة خاصة مع الأوكرانيين وغضب تجاه غزاتهم"".",https://www.alaraby.com/news/%D9%81%D9%88%D8%B6%D9%89-%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%B7%D9%88%D8%B9%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%AE%D8%B1%D8%B7%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A8-%D8%A5%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D9%88%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%83%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7

Siły rosyjskie użyły w Popasnej w obwodzie ługańskim na Ukrainie zabronionych pocisków fosforowych .

. Prezydent Andrzej Duda w rozmowie z BBC nie wykluczył, że Władimir Putin może zdecydować o wykorzystaniu broni chemicznej.

Doradca prezydenta USA ds. bezpieczeństwa narodowego Jake Sullivan oświadczył, że nalot sił rosyjskich ""w pobliżu polskiej granicy dowodzi, że prezydent Putin rozszerza kierunki ataków"".

Uderzenia rakietowo-powietrzne sił rosyjskich dotknęły większość miast w rejonach walk - informują eksperci OSW.

ONZ: Niemal 2,7 mln osób wyjechało z objętej wojną Ukrainy. Z tego ponad 1,72 mln uchodźców wjechało do Polski.

Nie ma bezpośredniego zagrożenia dla Kijowa, rosyjskie wojska pod miastem zostały rozbite - powiedział doradca prezydenta Zełenskiego.

WAR BULLETIN

March 15, 10.00 EST

Russian troops continue to use civilian infrastructure for firing positions, deploy weapons and military equipment. They shelled residential buildings and infrastructure in Kyiv. As a result of the rocket attacks, two high-rise buildings in Podilsky and Svyatoshinsky districts were damaged.

There is a high probability of provocations aimed at involving the Belarusian side into the war against Ukraine.

As of the morning of March 15, 2022, 97 children were killed and more than 100 wounded. 400 educational institutions were damaged, 59 of them were completely destroyed. At least 28 buildings of spiritual significance have been damaged.

WAR ROOM

General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine

The total combat losses of the enemy from 24.02 to 15.03 were approximately:

personnel - more 13500,

tanks ‒ 404,

APV ‒ 1279,

artillery systems – 150,

MLRS - 64,

anti-aircraft warfare systems - 36,

aircraft – 81,

helicopters – 95,

vehicles - 640,

vessels - 3,

fuel tanks - 60,

UAV operational-tactical level - 9.

Data are being updated. The calculation is complicated by the high intensity of hostilities.

The twentieth day of the heroic resistance of the Ukrainian people to the Russian military invasion began. Status, position and nature of actions of the defense forces without significant changes.

The Armed Forces of Ukraine are inflicting devastating blows on groups of troops and the rear infrastructure of the occupiers. During the past 24hrs, four helicopters, one plane and a fighter shot down an enemy cruise missile were hit by a group of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

The groups of the occupying forces involved in the offensive did not have significant success in all areas of advance. The main efforts continue to be focused on maintaining the occupied borders.

The enemy continues to launch missile and bomb attacks on critical infrastructure. Uses a network of health care facilities in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine to treat wounded personnel.

Also, the invaders continue to insidiously use civilian infrastructure to equip firing positions, deploy weapons and military equipment.

According to the available information, due to the inability to maintain the functioning of institutions and organizations to ensure the livelihood of settlements in the temporarily occupied territories of ORDLO (certain areas of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts), the occupiers are forced to suspend the mobilization of communal workers.

The moral and psychological state of the enemy remains low, which leads to the refusal of servicemen of the Armed Forces to carry out the orders of the command. Also, according to available information, mobilized residents from the occupied territory of some districts of Luhansk region are sent to replenish the losses of active units of the Russian occupation forces involved in hostilities in Ukraine.

The enemy is trying to capture Mariupol. Ukrainian soldiers successfully repulsed the attacks of the invaders. The total losses of the enemy amounted to about 150 people, 2 tanks, 7 infantry fighting vehicles and one armoured personnel carrier. After the losses, the occupiers stopped the offensive and retreated.

Artillery and aircraft inflicted fire damage on the accumulation of military equipment and enemy columns on the advance routes. According to the available information, as a result of the artillery fire, 12 units of motor vehicles were destroyed.

The battalion tactical groups from the 336th Separate Marine Brigade and the 11th Separate Assault Brigade also suffered.

No signs of preparation for a naval landing operation were found in the Black Sea and Azov operational zones. The state, position, and nature of the actions of the defense forces have not changed significantly. Ukraine's defense forces continue to successfully resist the occupiers.

During the day, the enemy did not conduct active offensive operations, focused on replenishing current losses, recruiting mercenaries from other countries, and resolving problematic issues related to the logistical support of the occupying forces operating in Ukraine. Information on the organization of mercenary training centres in Smolensk, Russia, and Gomel and Bobruisk, Belarus, has been repeatedly reported.

In the Volyn direction, the enemy keeps the group guarding the Ukrainian-Belarusian state border. At the same time, there is a high probability of provocations aimed at involving the Belarusian side in the occupation forces.

In the Polissya direction, the enemy made an unsuccessful attempt to break through the defenses of our troops in the direction of Guta-Mezhyhirska, Lyutyzh. At the same time, the occupiers were unsuccessful in capturing Makarov.

In the northern direction, the enemy is trying to increase the group, to organize logistics to resume the offensive on Chernihiv.

In the Slobozhansky direction, the main target of the enemy remains the encirclement of the cities of Sumy and Kharkiv.

In the Donetsk and Tavriya directions, the occupiers did not succeed in the Lysychansk district, suffered losses, and withdrew. In the area of Rubizhne, the enemy is trying to gain a foothold on the western outskirts of the city. Continues assault on the western and eastern outskirts of Mariupol with the support of aircraft and artillery. In the South Bug direction, the enemy is not taking active action, trying to hold previously occupied positions.

Unsuccessful in the main areas, the occupying forces continue to launch missile and air strikes on civilians, civilians and critical infrastructure in violation of international humanitarian law.

Security Service of Ukraine

The SSU detained a hacker who provided the occupiers with mobile communications in Ukraine. With the help of this collaborator: anonymously made phone calls from the Russian Federation to the invaders' cell phones in Ukraine; sent text messages to Ukrainian security forces and civil servants with offers to surrender and defect to the occupiers; transmitted commands and instructions to advanced groups of Russian invaders.

The SSU found that up to a thousand calls were made in a single day because of this hacker. A significant portion of them were from the top leadership of the enemy army.

POLICY

President of Ukraine

Responsibility for war crimes of the Russian military is inevitable - address by the President of Ukraine.

Another difficult day, which is still approaching our victory. Approaching peace for Ukraine.

As before, the enemy is confused. They did not expect such resistance. They believed in their propaganda, which has been lying about us for decades. They still can't recollect themselves. But they have already begun to understand that they will not achieve anything by war.

Their soldiers know this. Their officers are aware of this. They flee the battlefield. They abandon equipment. We take trophies and use them to protect Ukraine. Today, Russian troops are, in fact, one of the suppliers of equipment to our army. They could not imagine such a thing in a nightmare.

And I want to tell the Russian soldiers. Those who have already entered our land. And who are just about to be sent to fight against us.

Russian conscripts! Listen to me very carefully. Russian officers! You’ve already understood everything. You will not take anything from Ukraine. You will take lives. There are a lot of you. But your life will also be taken.

But why should you die? What for? I know that you want to survive. We hear your conversations in the intercepts, we hear what you really think about this senseless war, about this disgrace and about your state. Your conversations with each other. Your calls home to your family. We hear it all. We draw conclusions. We know who you are.

Therefore, I offer you a choice. On behalf of the Ukrainian people, I give you a chance. Chance to survive. If you surrender to our forces, we will treat you the way people are supposed to be treated. As people, decently. In a way you were not treated in your army. And in a way your army does not treat ours. Choose!

Our brave defenders continue to inflict devastating losses on Russian troops. Soon the number of downed helicopters of Russia will reach hundreds of units. They have already lost 80 warplanes. Hundreds of tanks and thousands of other units of equipment.

In 19 days, the Russian army has lost more in Ukraine than in two bloody and years-long wars in Chechnya. For what? I am grateful to those Russians who do not stop trying to convey the truth. To those who fight disinformation and tell the truth, real facts to their friends and loved ones. And personally to the woman who entered the studio of Channel One with a poster against the war. To those who are not afraid to protest. As long as your country has not completely closed itself off from the whole world, turning into a very large North Korea, you must fight. You must not lose your chance.

The European Union has approved the fourth package of sanctions against Russia. The fourth - and I'm sure not the last.

We are working with partners on new restrictions that will be applied against the Russian state. Everyone who is responsible for the war. Everyone who is responsible for the destruction of democracy. Everyone who is responsible for repression against people. Everyone will get an answer. The answer of the world. And this is just the beginning.

Responsibility for war crimes of the Russian military is inevitable. Responsibility for a deliberate humanitarian catastrophe in Ukrainian cities is inevitable. The whole world sees what is happening in Mariupol. Kharkiv. Chernihiv. Sumy. Okhtyrka. Hostomel. Irpin. In all our cities.

All our partners are informed of the crimes of the invaders against civilians and local self-government in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. In the temporarily occupied areas. There will be an answer for that. Necessarily. For the disrupted humanitarian corridors. Necessarily.

During the day of March 14, 3,806 Ukrainians were evacuated from the cities and towns of the Kyiv and Luhansk regions.

Our convoy with one hundred tons of what is most necessary for Mariupol is still kept in Berdyansk. For three days already. But we will try. We will do everything to ensure that Mariupol residents receive food, water and medicine.

I provided full information about the actions of the invaders on the Ukrainian land in conversations with friends and partners of our state. Every aggressive action of the invaders only pushes the world to new sanctions.

I spoke with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. With President of Poland Andrzej Duda. Prime Minister of Luxembourg Xavier Bettel. We have 100% mutual understanding.

The conversation with Prime Minister of Israel Bennett was also important. As part of a negotiation effort to end this war as soon as possible. With a fair peace.

Our delegation also worked on this in negotiations with the Russian party. Pretty good, as I was told. But let's see. They will continue tomorrow.

The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine has agreed on a package of decisions to support our economy. So that business works. So that people have jobs. Where security allows. Where people are ready for it.

First, we are starting tax reform. Instead of VAT and income tax we give a rate of 2 percent of turnover and simplified accounting. For small businesses - this is the first and second group of sole proprietors - we set a voluntary payment of a single tax. That is, if you can - pay. You can't - no questions asked.

The second is maximum business deregulation. We cancel all inspections for all businesses. So that everyone works normally. So that the cities come to life. So that life continues wherever there are no hostilities.

The only condition is that you ensure the normal operation of your business in the framework of Ukrainian law.

These are just the first two steps of our tax reform. To be continued.

And finally.

I have just signed a decree on awarding state awards of Ukraine to 234 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who showed personal courage and heroism in the fight for our land. For our independence. 59 of them posthumously.

May the memory of everyone who gave life for our state live forever!

The Russian invasion is destroying churches, mosques, synagogues and religious schools in various regions of Ukraine. While Kremlin propagandists are cynically covering up their imperial ambitions with claims to ""protect Orthodoxy,"" an aggressive attack by Russian troops is destroying Orthodox churches and other shrines in Ukraine's religious communities.

At least 28 buildings of spiritual significance (excluding adjacent buildings) have been damaged in at least six regions of Ukraine: Kyiv, Donetsk, Zhytomyr, Luhansk, Kharkiv and Chernihiv.

Today, March 14, is the nineteenth day Russia's military attack on Ukraine continues. We're reporting about all the current news. The article will be constantly updated.

What is today?

Key points.

The Command of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine informs: During the past 24hrs, four planes, three helicopters, and an unmanned aerial vehicle of the occupiers were hit by the air defense forces of the state.

In one of the strategic directions in the Kyiv region, a group of enemy aircraft of the Su-35, Su-34, and Su-25 types tried to launch missile and bomb strikes on the defensive redoubts of Ukrainian defenders. And while the Air Force fighters were in a positional air confrontation with the overwhelming forces of the occupiers, the air defenses fired anti-aircraft missiles at enemy air targets. Three hits on enemy planes were previously recorded.

Anti-aircraft missile forces also report the destruction of three Russian helicopters and one UAV.

The air defense of the North Operational Command destroyed another plane of the occupiers in the morning!

Total combat losses of the enemy from 24.02 to 14.03:

personnel – more than 12,000 people;

tanks – 389;

armored combat vehicles – 1249;

artillery systems – 150;

MLRS – 64;

air defense means – 34;

aircraft – 77;

helicopters – 90;

automotive equipment – 617;

ships / boats – 3;

fuel tanks – 60;

UAV of operational and tactical level – 8.

The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has started using the face recognition system of the American company Clearview AI, which has access to a database of 10 billion photos. 2 billion of them are from the VKontakte social media. The system will help identify Russian assailants, fight misinformation and identify the dead.

The enemies will not be able to eat at the expense of Ukraine in captivity. All Russian prisoners of war will either be exchanged for captured Ukrainians, or will serve their sentences in Ukraine and work to rebuild the destroyed infrastructure.

""We are going through the worst ordeal in our history, in our lives. We protect the most precious thing we have. We must hold on, we must fight. And we will win. I believe in that,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Today is Volunteer Fighter Day! Ukrainian volunteers are a symbol of heroism, patriotism, and courage. We will win! Glory to Ukraine!

Important! Rescuers once again ask not to spread the exact coordinates of the impact of Russian missiles immediately after the shelling and not to help the occupiers ""finish"" certain objects. This also applies to those in power. Being the first doesn't always mean being useful, says Svitlana Vodolaha, a spokeswoman for the State Emergency Service in Kyiv.

The UN Security Council is convening an extraordinary meeting on the activities of the OSCE Mission to Ukraine. Last week, the OSCE monitoring mission evacuated all its international members from Ukraine and suspended its activities since 2014.

And President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy plans to address the United States Congress on Wednesday, March 16. The Wall Street Journal reported this.

The Australian government has announced sanctions against 33 Russian rich people and their relatives.

Instagram in Russia is dead. Minus 64 million users. What ""sad"" news.

Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid has confirmed that the country is imposing sanctions on Russia. ""Israel will not be a route to bypass sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States & other western countries.

He listed the companies that continue to work in Russia:

– retail chains Leroy Merlin, Metro, Auchan, Spar;

– Pirelli and Bridgestone Tires automotive products;

– Accor and Intercontinental hotels

– Engineering companies: OTIS Worldwide, Honeywell, Mohawk Industries, Arconic;

What's in Russia?

Last night, there was a report that Russia had turned to China for military assistance, the Financial Times was the first to write, ""the Mordor is running out of resources.""

This attempt to ""feed"" the drowning army at the expense of the eastern neighbor caused great unrest among Ukrainians. But the Chinese embassy was quick to say that no requests for help had been received from Russia, according to Reuters.

Interestingly, even a quick reaction did not save China from trouble. Amid the aggressor's appeal to China for military aid, today on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the index of Chinese companies fell by 11% and they lost $2.1 trillion in one day. This is the level of toxicity!

Russia will not ask the United States and Europe to lift sanctions, Western pressure will not change Moscow's course. This was reported in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation. Excellent decision! The USSR also said so and where is it now?

The main Russian propagandist Solovyov is planned to be declared internationally wanted. He was informed about the suspicion of public calls to change the state border of Ukraine, which led to the death of people.

Another problem in Russia is that women's hygiene products have disappeared en masse from store shelves. After all, as it turned out, there are almost no sanitary pads in Russia. Even such a trifle came to the Mordor from abroad.

""The Russian armed forces don't rule out the staging of large settlements in Ukraine under full control to ensure maximum security of the population,"" said Putin's spokesperson Peskov. We listen to his delusion, but we are not afraid. In fact, the Armed Forces reject the enemy's columns, not allowing them to move inland.

У комітеті держдуми з оборони хочуть заборонити зворотний в'їзд зіркам, бізнесменам, журналістам, які виїхали з росії. Вони, звісно, поки що і самі не хочуть повертатися, але ситуація стане цікавішою, коли країни, в яких зараз окопалася бігла ""російська еліта"" приймуть рішення о примусовій депортації всіх росіян.

The State Duma Committee on Defense wants to ban the entry of stars, entrepreneurs, and journalists who have left Russia. Of course, they do not want to return yet, but the situation will become more interesting when the countries where the fleeing ""Russian elite"" is now entrenched decide to forcibly deport all Russians.

Russia may block YouTube in the near future if video hosting does not comply with the requirements of Roskomnadzor to unblock the channels of Russian propagandists.

And this is a message for those Russians who tried to circumvent the ban on Instagram and Facebook via VPN. The motherland will catch you here too, son!

There is a military camp in Belgorod, Russia, which holds servicemen who have refused to fight against Ukraine. This was announced by the officer of the Center for Operational Information of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Leonid Matiukhin.

According to him, today a special operation of the Russian Federation is being developed on the territory of Belarus. ""Today they really want to put Russian uniforms on the Belarusian military. Some of them refuse to fight against our country. But now the Russian FSB and the special services on the territory are persuading Belarusians to change into Russian uniforms and enter our territory according to Russian standards."" Ukrainian troops are ready for such a development.

❗Statement by Russian Defence Ministry

▪ On March 14, at about 11.30 a.m. Moscow time, Tochka-U tactical missile was fired at a residential block of Donetsk city from the territory controlled by the Kiev nationalist regime.

▪ The shelling of the city was carried out from the north-western direction, from the area of Krasnoarmeysk settlement, which is controlled by Ukrainian nationalist units.

▪ As a result of the explosion of a cluster warhead in the center of Donetsk, 20 civilians were killed. Another 28 people, including children, were seriously injured and taken to medical institutions.

▪ The use of such weapons on a town with no armed forces firing positions, i.e. deliberately targeting civilians, is a war crime.

▪ The armament of Tochka-U missile‘ warhead with cluster ammunition proves that the purpose of the nationalists‘ strike on the city was to kill as many civilians as possible.

❗I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the decision to use this type of missile weapons is made, at least, by the command of the Ukrainian grouping of troops, after approval by the leadership of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Kiev.

▪ All this once again confirms the Nazi and anti-human nature of the ruling regime in Ukraine today.

Eine interessante Aussage zum Angriff mit Marschflugkörpern auf das Trainingszentrum im Westen der Ukraine am Vortag: Diese Waffen wurden von russischen Flugzeugen außerhalb des ukrainischen Luftraums gestartet – auch eine Flugverbotszone hätte daran nichts geändert:

A background briefing at the Pentagon about the Russian war on Ukraine just finished. It’s Day 19 of the war.

Basic takeaways:

I’ll start with the strikes Sunday on the Ukrainian military training center at Yavoriv, near the border with Poland.

A senior U.S. defense official says they were carried out by cruise missiles launched from long-range Russian bombers from Russian airspace.

Note: That’s different than speculation and some reporting yesterday that they were carried out by sea-launched missiles from Russian ships. Those are still quite rare in this war.

“More than a couple dozen” Russian cruise missiles were launched at the training center from aircraft, the senior U.S. defense official says.

He notes that a no-fly zone patrolling Ukrainian airspace would not have stopped this strike.

The Pentagon cannot verify the number of killed and wounded at the training center. The senior U.S. defense official repeats U.S. statements yesterday that no U.S. troops, U.S. contractors, or U.S. civilians in a government capacity were there.

The Pentagon is not clear on whether any Americans there as volunteers for the Ukrainian effort were there. It’s not something they are tracking, the senior U.S. defense official says.

Russian ground advances remain largely stalled, the senior U.S. defense official says. No “appreciable” change on advances on Kyiv, Kharkiv, Mariupol, etc.

Pentagon still sees no indications of the Russians sending in military reinforcements from elsewhere in Russia, the senior U.S. defense official said.

„Siege mentality“ by Russia still playing out, the senior U.S. defense official says. Heavy bombardment of Kyiv, Kharkiv, Mariupol, etc.

Mariupol and Chernihiv remain under attack and isolated.

Senior U.S. defense official on Russia: „Clearly, they are increasing the amount of long-range fires they are applying to these cities, these population centers that are holding out … They are obviously continuing the bombardment and increasing that, no doubt about it.”

• Russland sieht sich weiterhin im Gegensatz fast zum Rest der Welt – und wendet sich auch gegen internationale Organisationen wie die Vereinten Nationen und das Internationale Komitee vom Roten Kreuz. Aus einer Mitteilung der russischen gemeinsamen Koordinierungsstelle für humanitäre Hilfe in der Ukraine (im auf Englisch veröffentlichten Original):

Western countries, the United Nations, the OSCE, the International Committee of the Red Cross, as well as a number of other international organizations, in the catastrophic humanitarian situation that has developed for Ukraine, still remain on the sidelines and do not give a principled assessment of outright neo-Nazism, which has already befuddled the Kiev authorities and reigns in the territories controlled by Ukrainian nationalists.

56,9d92ce3f-6989-4c72-bbd6-e1689d73403e,"['Tim Lister', 'Olga Voitovych', 'Tara John']",2022-03-12 00:00:00,"Kyiv, Ukraine (CNN) The Russian assault across Ukraine raged Saturday as explosions were heard in Kyiv and fighting intensified around the capital. Hours later, Russia warned the United States that it would fire on weapon shipments to Ukraine, raising the risk of direct confrontation between Moscow and a NATO country.

A number of major cities are under pressure as Russian strikes hit civilian structures. Smoke rose east of the river in Dnipro early on Saturday where CNN journalists felt at least two explosions and saw the cloudy remnants of what looked like anti-aircraft fire.

A large swath of Makariv, a village 30 miles west of Kyiv, has sustained significant damage from apparent Russian airstrikes.

CNN geolocated and verified the authenticity of photos, posted to social media Saturday, which show major damage to apartment complexes, schools and a medical facility. One of the more stark images from Makariv shows a large hole in the northern wall of an apartment building from a military strike. Many of the buildings in the photos have sustained damage on their northern facades, evidence that points to military strikes that hit them as being Russian.

In Chernihiv, some 100 kilometers north of Kyiv, local landmark Hotel Ukraine was hit overnight. ""I am here now. There is no hotel anymore,"" Vyacheslav Chaus, head of Chernihiv region administration, said Saturday.

The northern city, which is close to the Belarus border, has been surrounded by Russian forces for more than a week and video from the city showed the collapsed floors of the hotel as well as widespread damage from missiles and airstrikes.

Chaus said civilians were dying from the strikes, which brought down the city's electricity network. ""Many people are being injured. The enemy shells civilian infrastructure, where there is no military,"" he said, saying the city has ""no electricity, almost no water, gas, and heat.""

The Russian Ministry of Defense has repeatedly claimed that Russian forces are not targeting civilians.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a Saturday address the whole country was now a front line. ""A few small towns just don't exist anymore. And this is a tragedy. They are just gone. And people are also gone.""

Zelensky said negotiations to end Russia's invasion of Ukraine ""must begin with a ceasefire,"" adding that Ukraine has lost about 1,300 troops as of Saturday. CNN has been unable to independently verify these numbers.

Later Saturday, Zelensky said that he was grateful for international support but urged allies to provide more aid.

""I keep reiterating to our allies and friends abroad; they have to keep doing more for our country, for Ukrainians and Ukraine. Because it is not only for Ukraine, but it is for all of Europe,"" he said. ""The evil which purposefully targets peaceful cities and ambulance vans and explodes hospitals will not stop with just one country if they have the strength to keep going.""

The US and NATO say they're taking steps to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian troops, and they have continued to provide Ukraine with security assistance, including anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons. But the US and NATO have also tried to avoid being drawn into an outright conflict with Russia. US President Joe Biden emphasized that point on Friday, that the US will not send ground troops into Ukraine , which is not a member of NATO.

""We will not fight the third world war in Ukraine,"" Biden said after reiterating the US' full support to its NATO allies and promising that the US will defend ""every inch"" of NATO territory.

""I want to be clear though, we are going to make sure that Ukraine has the weapons to defend themselves from an invading Russian force. And we will send money and food aid to save Ukrainians' lives,"" he added.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov on Saturday warned the US against transferring weapons to Ukraine, saying convoys with foreign weapons would be considered ""legitimate targets.""

""We warned the United States that pumping Ukraine with weapons from a number of countries orchestrated by them is not just a dangerous move, but these are actions that turn the corresponding convoys into legitimate targets,"" Ryabkov said Saturday on the Russian state-run Channel One, according to state-owned RIA Novosti news agency.

Determined resistance

In Ukraine, Russia has faced defiance from the public in the past two weeks. On Saturday, several hundred people swarmed the city hall in the southern Ukrainian city of Melitopol following the detention of its mayor, Ivan Fedorov, by armed men the day before.

Shortly after Fedorov's detention, the Russian-backed Luhansk regional prosecutor claimed Fedorov had committed terrorism offenses, allegations that Zelensky called a ""crime against democracy"" on Saturday.

The Zaporozhye regional administration said Saturday a new mayor had been installed. Galina Danilchenko, a former member of the Melitopol city council, was introduced as the acting mayor on local TV, according to a statement from the regional administration posted on Telegram. In her televised statement, Danilchenko said that her ""main task is to take all necessary steps to get the city back to normal.""

She claimed there were people still in Melitopol who would try to destabilize ""the situation and provoke a reaction of bad behavior.""

""I ask you to keep your wits about you and not to give in to these provocations,"" she said. ""I appeal to the deputies, elected by the people, on all levels. Since you were elected by the people, it is your duty to care about the well-being of your citizens.""

In Kyiv, Russia's advance has faced stiff resistance from Ukrainian forces. On Saturday, the UK's Ministry of Defence's latest intelligence assessment said the bulk of Russian ground forces were about 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) from the center of the Ukrainian capital.

In Berestyanka -- 10 miles west of the airbase -- a number of fuel trucks and what Maxar says appear to be multiple rocket launchers are seen positioned in a field near trees.

Maxar satellite imagery taken on Thursday showed that the 40-mile Russian column northwest of Kyiv had largely dispersed and regrouped. But the intelligence assessment warned, ""this is likely to support a Russian attempt to encircle the city. It could also be an attempt by Russia to reduce its vulnerability to Ukrainian counter attacks, which have taken a significant toll on Russian forces.""

The north and northeastern cities of Chernihiv and Sumy, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and Mariupol in the south, remain encircled by Russian forces, the ministry added.

A senior Ukrainian official in the southern region of Kherson, now in Russian control, has said that the ""occupiers"" are pressing the regional council to agree to a referendum on the area's ""independence"" from Ukraine. There's been no word from the Russian side about any referendum plans.

Similar referendums were held after Russian-backed separatists took control in 2014 of parts of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions. People's Republics were later declared in both regions.

Ukraine's state-operated nuclear energy company said Saturday that Russian officials had arrived at Ukraine's largest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhya, demanding to take control of the facility.

Zaporizhzhya has been occupied by Russian forces for more than a week now, with Energoatom previously claiming its employees had been forced to work at ""gunpoint."" Chernobyl nuclear power plant is also under the control of Russian forces.

Despite the onslaught, Zelensky claimed on Saturday that Ukrainian forces are inflicting the ""biggest blow to Russia's army in decades,"" saying that 31 Russian tactical battalion groups had lost capability, and more than 360 Russian tanks have been lost.

Zelensky added that groups of Russian troops were surrendering to Ukrainian forces, but that Russia is now recruiting fighters, reservists, conscripts, and mercenaries to ""outnumber"" Ukrainian forces.

Russia's losses include Major General Andriy Kolesnikov, the third Russian general to have been killed by Ukrainian forces, a Western defense official confirmed on Friday. He was commander of the Eastern Military District, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense's website, and the Western official noted for context that three Russian general staff officers were killed during the whole Syrian conflict.

Deteriorating conditions

As Russia sustains losses, its bombardment of the country continues to degrade living conditions in several areas. Officials are now racing to send aid and evacuate citizens from encircled cities.

Ukrainian officials announced a fresh attempt to secure at least 13 evacuation corridors from different cities, despite reporting that only a few civilians could leave the previous day.

Addressing the besieged city of Mariupol, Zelensky said Saturday that Ukrainian forces would guarantee a ceasefire along an evacuation corridor so supplies could enter, and civilians can leave.

Ukrainian emergency employees and volunteers carry an injured pregnant woman from a maternity hospital that was damaged by shelling in Mariupol, Ukraine, Wednesday, March 9, 2022.

With relatively clear skies over Mariupol, new satellite imagery taken Saturday morning from Maxar showed the extent of the damage there, including some caused by military strikes reported earlier in the week.

In Mariupol's western neighborhood of Zhovteneyvi, a large -- still smoldering -- crater was seen near the Okko gas station. Smoke appeared to be rising from an apartment complex across the street. The roofs of warehouses down the street also appeared to have large holes from military strikes.

Within the apartment complex, several buildings seemed to have sustained significant damage. A debris field was seen surrounding some of the buildings with a large smoke plume.

Just northwest of the gas station, an additional satellite image showed impact craters dotting a snow-covered field. Vehicle tread marks were also seen. Just more than a mile south, in an industrial area in the Primorskyi neighborhood, a large fire was seen raging.

There was some good news amid the destruction. A pregnant woman, whose rescue from the Mariupol maternity hospital this week was captured in a viral AP photo, gave birth to a baby girl, her family told CNN.

Mariana Vishegirskaya was among a number of women at the Mariupol maternity hospital who survived the shelling.

Her aunt Tatiana Liubchenko said the baby was named Veronica but she was worried about the situation in the city. ""We got the information that the water and food of the people there are running out and we are very worried, because the green corridor is not opened and the Russians do not allow, the food does not come. And it's so cold there right now so they can't get warm,"" Liubchenko said.

The fighting has displaced around 2 million Ukrainians in the country, the UN said Friday, and 2.5 million people have fled its borders.",https://edition.cnn.com/2022/03/12/europe/russia-invasion-ukraine-03-12-intl/index.html
57,9d92ce3f-6989-4c72-bbd6-e1689d73403e,"['Tim Lister', 'Mohammed Tawfeeq', 'Olga Voitovych', 'Simone Mccarthy', 'Tara John']",2022-03-13 00:00:00,"Kyiv and Lviv, Ukraine (CNN) Russia expanded its offensive to western Ukraine on Sunday, firing missiles near the city of Lviv and hitting a large military base close to the Polish border, reportedly killing dozens of people and drawing the war closer to the borders of a NATO country.

The attack came the day after the Kremlin threatened to attack Western weapons shipments to Ukraine.

As the invasion runs into its third week, the northwest city of Lviv has largely been spared from Russia's relentless bombardment. The picturesque city has instead become ground zero for displaced Ukrainians. Hundreds of thousands of them have flooded into the city in search of relative safety, with many using it as a stopping point before making their way to the Polish border about 43 miles (70 kilometers) away.

But Russia's war is moving closer to the cultural hub. Russian forces fired more than 30 missiles at Yavoriv military training ground on Sunday, according to Lviv's military administration. Located between Lviv and the Polish border, the military base has held joint drills with NATO and Western military personnel, including the United States.

A witness, who was on the base when the strike happened, told CNN of hearing a ""sudden clap"" from a bomb shelter, adding that the explosion craters were 10 meters deep and there are fears people are under the rubble.

Local authorities say 35 people were killed and 134 injured at the military base, in what Ukraine's Minister of Defence Oleksii Reznikov described as a ""terrorist attack"" on peace and security ""near the EU-NATO border.""

There were no reports of foreign nationals among the casualties so far, say Ukraine defense officials. The strike came the day after Russia launched a missile attack in the northeastern city of Lutsk, only 70 miles from the Polish border.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday that it was only a matter of time before Russia's military assault on Ukraine expanded to members of NATO -- unless the alliance installs a no-fly zone in Ukraine.

""Last year, I made a clear warning to NATO leaders that if there were no tough preventive sanctions against Russia, it would start a war,"" Zelensky said in a video address Sunday posted to his Facebook page. ""Now, I repeat again, if you do not close our sky, it is only a matter of time before Russian missiles fall on your territory. NATO territory. On the homes of citizens of NATO countries.""

US national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN that the strikes on Lviv were a sign that the war was not going to plan. Russian President Vladimir Putin ""is frustrated by the fact that his forces are not making the kind of progress that he thought that they would make against major cities, including Kyiv, that he is expanding the number of targets, that he is lashing out, and that he is trying to cause damage in every part of the country,"" Sullivan said.

Ambulances are seen traveling to and from the Yavoriv military base on March 13, 2022.

A senior US official told CNN Sunday that Russia has asked China for military assistance in Ukraine, including drones. Potential assistance from the Chinese would be a significant development in Russia's invasion, and could upend the hold Ukrainian forces still have in the country.

When asked by CNN about reports of Russia's request for military aid, Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in the US, said in a statement, ""I've never heard of that.""

As attacks on civilian areas continued throughout the weekend, a new round of Russian-Ukrainian talks has been set for Monday.

Zelensky alluded to the talks in his remarks Sunday, saying his country's delegation ""has a clear task -- to do everything to ensure a meeting of the presidents. The meeting that I am sure people are waiting for.""

US President Joe Biden spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday evening, according to a White House official. Macron had spoken to Putin on Saturday in a joint call with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

American journalist killed in Ukraine

Heavy fighting continued Sunday, with Britain's Ministry of Defense saying Russia was attempting to ""envelop"" Ukrainian forces in the east of the country as it advanced from Crimea westwards towards Odessa.

Russian troops continue to focus on the capital Kyiv. Ramzan Kadyrov, the pro-Kremlin leader of Russia's Chechnya region, reportedly told Russian soldiers outside of Kyiv that the key task is to seize the capital, Russian state news network Russia 24 reported on Sunday.

Brent Renaud is pictured at the Peabody Awards Ceremony in New York City on 2015.

Amid a growing civilian toll in Ukraine, American journalist Brent Renaud, 50, was killed by Russian forces in Irpin, on the outskirts of Kyiv, according to social media posts by Kyiv region police. Two other journalists were wounded by Russian troops, the police added.

Renaud ""paid with his life for attempting to expose the insidiousness, cruelty, and ruthlessness of the aggressor,"" an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister, Anton Gerashchenko, said in a statement on Telegram.

The US State Department confirmed Renaud's death on Sunday. ""We are horrified that journalists and filmmakers—noncombatants—have been killed and injured in Ukraine by Kremlin forces,"" department spokesman Ned Price said on Twitter. ""This is yet another gruesome example of the Kremlin's indiscriminate actions.""

Social media footage has emerged of a journalist identified as Juan Arredondo, a filmmaker and visual journalist who is also an adjunct professor at Columbia Journalism School, at Okhmatdyt hospital in Kyiv, in which he describes being shot at by Russian forces while driving through a checkpoint in Irpin on the way to film refugees leaving the city.

The exact circumstances of the attack against the two journalists are yet to be determined.

TIME released a statement Sunday saying Renaud was in the region working on a TIME Studios project on the global refugee crisis.

""We are devastated by the loss of Brent Renaud. As an award-winning filmmaker and journalist, Brent tackled the toughest stories around the world often alongside his brother Craig Renaud,"" TIME Editor in Chief and CEO Edward Felsenthal and President and COO Ian Orefice in the statement.

Ukrainians take to the streets to protest

Ukrainians continue to protest Russian occupation. The southern city of Kherson, which is occupied by Russian forces, saw the biggest protest since the invasion on Sunday. Hundreds of demonstrators flocked to the streets to protest against suspected Russian plans to turn the southern Ukrainian oblast into a breakaway republic.

Residents of Kherson turned out en masse on Sunday, March 13, in the largest protest the city has seen since the invasion began and it came under Russian occupation.

Waving Ukrainian flags, the protesters chanted anti-Russian slogans, filled with expletives about Putin, according to videographer Artem Ivanov, who is on the ground in Kherson.

Ihor Kolykhaiev, the mayor of Kherson, said in a video posted on Facebook Sunday that mass protests show ""Kherson is Ukraine"" and insisted that he retains administrative control of the city.

But the mayor also said that the city had been cut off from humanitarian aid and was running out of resources. He said that the city ""can't receive a humanitarian cargo here, food is finishing in the stores, we are running out of gas, we only have diesel oil left at the gas stations. We are running out of the medications and insulin.""

""Our main weapon is unity,"" he added.

In recent days, at least one Kherson regional council official warned that occupation forces were laying the groundwork for the ""Kherson People's Republic."" If true, the move would mirror Moscow's establishment of two Russian-backed breakaway states in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.

Putin recognized the independence of those two territories in the days leading up to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine as part of his pretext to launch an assault on the country.

School demolished by Russian strike

Russia's air offensive on Sunday also bore down on heavily populated areas around the country. Nine people were killed in a Russian bombardment in Mykolaiv Sunday, local officials said. The strategic southern city has resisted Russian occupation and impeded an apparent push towards the major port of Odessa to the west.

A school in the village of Zelenogai, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) east of Mykolaiv, was demolished by a Russian military strike, Mykolaiv regional administrator Vitali Kim said.

Kim said that the military strike left several people either dead or in critical condition. ""Some people got under the rubble and we are evacuating them,"" Kim said.

Missiles also destroyed an airport in the western Ukrainian city of Ivano-Frankivsk, while the northern city of Chernihiv was struck for the third night in a row, hitting a high-rise building, the regional head, Vyacheslav Chaus, said.

In the eastern region of Luhansk, much of which is now occupied by Russian forces, the head of the regional administration, Serhiy Haidai, said there had been ""massive shelling"" of several towns, including Kreminna and Rubizhne, which had prevented buses from leaving with civilians.

The Ukrainian military thwarted an attempt by Russian military vehicles to cross the Irpin River on a pontoon bridge near Hostomel, a new satellite image from Maxar Technologies shows.

The bridge first appeared in satellite imagery from Maxar on March 10, appearing to have been destroyed. An additional photo, published on social media on March 13, also shows the pontoon bridge destroyed, in addition to nearby Russian military vehicles.

Ukrainian forces in Kyiv's suburb of Irpin have so far repelled the Russian forces' attempted advance towards the Ukrainian capital city. With the main bridge crossing the Irpin River having been destroyed by the Ukrainians, the river poses a significant obstacle for the Russian military.

Also on Sunday, Ukraine's National Energy Company Ukrenergo completed repair work and resumed power supply to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the company announced. The plant's electrical system was damaged during a Russian attack on March 9. Later on Sunday, the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement that the staff at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant are so tired they have stopped carrying out the repair and maintenance of safety-related equipment.

As the devastation mounts, Zelensky said the key task Sunday is to get the humanitarian convoy that is traveling towards the besieged city of Mariupol to its destination. Mariupol has been under siege for more than a week. Much of the city is without power and water.

Mariupol's city administration confirmed Sunday night that the convoy was still stuck some 50 miles to the west.

As the city waits, officials said it had suffered 22 bombing attacks in the last 24 hours and ""to date, 2,187 Mariupol residents have died from attacks by Russia.""

Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said that nine of the 14 evacuation routes declared Sunday had allowed civilians to escape fighting. About 3,950 people were rescued in the Kyiv region and 1,600 were able to escape from the Luhansk region in the east of the country, according to Vereshchuk.

""The city of Mariupol was subjected to shelling and aerial bombardment all day long,"" Vereshchuk said. ""The humanitarian cargo remained blocked in the city of Berdyansk halfway to the occupied city.""

New round of talks

Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podoliak said Sunday that the next round of Russian-Ukrainian talks will take place on Monday, via video link.

""Again. Negotiations go non-stop in the format of video conferences,"" Podoliak said on Twitter. ""Working groups are constantly functioning. A large number of issues require constant attention.""

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian state news agency RIA earlier on Sunday that the talks would continue on Monday.

Podoliak said earlier Sunday that he believed that talks in the next few days will ""achieve concrete results.""

""Our proposals are on the table. They are very tough. Among them, the withdrawal of troops, the ceasefire,"" Podoliak said in a video posted on Twitter.

This comes after Leonid Slutsky, a Russian delegation member for talks with Ukraine, said ""significant progress"" has been made in negotiations with the Ukrainian delegation since the beginning of talks, Russian state news agency RIA reports.

Talks between Ukraine's and Russia's top diplomats last week in Turkey, however, yielded no discernible progress.

In Russia, authorities continue to violently repress all dissent. Riot police arrested more than 658 people in 35 Russian cities on Sunday, as the number of those detained grows, according to an independent human rights group, OVD-Info.

Images of brutal arrests have flooded social media showing people dragged off the streets by Russia's riot police. OVD-info also reported cases of house searches of human rights activists, police officers stopping people on the street to check through bags, as well as phone records.

According to the monitoring group, more than 5,000 people have been arrested across Russia for participating in anti-war protests since last weekend and over 14,633 protesters have been detained in dozens of cities since the start of the invasion on February 24.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/13/europe/russia-invasion-ukraine-03-13-intl-hnk/index.html

LONDON — Three European leaders staged a defiant show of support for Ukraine on Tuesday, traveling to its besieged capital, Kyiv, even as a relentless Russian artillery bombardment left apartment towers in the city ablaze, forcing terrified residents to flee into the street with only the clothes on their backs.

The dramatic visit by the prime ministers of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia, which unfolded in tight secrecy as they crossed the Ukrainian border by train after dawn, was a strikingly personal gesture. But it caught other European leaders off guard, angering some and baring uncomfortable divisions in how best to demonstrate Western solidarity with Ukraine.

It also came as President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia disparaged the second consecutive day of negotiations with Ukraine, undercutting the faint glimmers of hope raised from talks the day before that both sides were looking for a way to halt the war.

The Kremlin slapped retaliatory sanctions on President Biden and other senior American officials. Mr. Biden announced his own plans to travel to Europe next week to showcase the unity of the NATO alliance in the face of Russian aggression.

A spokesman for Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said the three visitors were “de facto” representing the European Union in Ukraine. In Brussels, however, officials said the trio did not have the E.U.’s blessing, and some European diplomats complained that the trip was too risky, given the Russian forces encircling Kyiv.

Others said they admired the audacity of the group, which also included Prime Minister Petr Fiala of the Czech Republic and Prime Minister Janez Jansa of Slovenia, casting it as a powerful symbol of the backing for Ukraine among countries on Europe’s eastern flank, where the specter of Russian aggression looms larger than in Paris or London.

Still, for all the symbolism of standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine’s leaders under the threat of Russia’s rockets, Ukraine was facing the devastating barrage largely on its own. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, imposed a 35-hour curfew, starting on Tuesday evening, which suggested the capital was entering an even more difficult phase of its grinding struggle to hold off Russian troops and tanks.

“This is their attempt to annihilate the Ukrainian people,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in an emotional video address to the Canadian Parliament, repeating his plea for NATO to enforce a no-fly zone over the country. “It is an attempt to destroy our future, our nation, our character.”

Mr. Zelensky asked the lawmakers to imagine if the CN Tower in Toronto were shelled like the towers in Kyiv. His language has become more pointed, even scolding, with each speech to a Western audience, revealing his frustration with leaders who have resisted more direct military involvement out of fear that it would entangle them in a wider conflict with Russia.

The Ukrainian leader, who has become a hero to many in the West, is scheduled to speak via video to Congress on Wednesday, where he is expected to amplify his pleas for more help and increase the pressure on the United States and its allies.

Mr. Biden is planning to announce $800 million in new security assistance to Ukraine on Wednesday, according to White House officials. The administration last week announced $200 million in security assistance for Ukraine and has made available a total of $2 billion in such funding.

On Tuesday evening, the Polish state broadcaster carried video of the Czech, Slovene and Polish leaders meeting Mr. Zelensky and other officials across a long table, with Ukraine’s blue-and-yellow flag behind them.

The Prime Ministers of 🇵🇱 @MorawieckiM, 🇸🇮 @JJansaSDS and 🇨🇿 @P_Fiala arrived on the behalf of @EUCouncil to #Kyiv today. The courage of true friends of 🇺🇦! Discussing support of #Ukraine and strengthening sanctions against the Russian aggression. — Denys Shmyhal (@Denys_Shmyhal) March 15, 2022

“They are here to support us,” Mr. Zelensky said at a news briefing after the meeting, which also was shown on Ukrainian television. “It is a great, courageous, right, friendly step. I am confident that with such friends, such countries and neighbors and partners, we can really win.”

A photograph posted earlier on Mr. Morawiecki’s Twitter account showed the three men poring over a map, seated in what appeared to be a train carriage en route to the Ukrainian capital.

“It is here, in war-torn Kyiv, that history is being made,” Mr. Morawiecki said in the Twitter post. “It is here, that freedom fights against the world of tyranny. It is here that the future of us all hangs in the balance.”

The White House announced that Mr. Biden would fly to Brussels for an extraordinary summit meeting of NATO on March 24. That may result in further economic and military aid for Ukraine but will likely fall short of Mr. Zelensky’s request for a no-fly zone. Administration officials declined to say whether Mr. Biden planned to meet with the Ukrainian president, whom he has called a hero. But they said Mr. Biden may go on to somewhere in Eastern Europe to meet with refugees streaming out of Ukraine.

The river of people fleeing the war continued unabated on Tuesday, as Russia claimed to have seized control of the strategic Kherson region in the south. Russian forces kept up their pounding of civilian targets in Kyiv, where Ukrainian troops were fortifying intersections with sandbags, tires, and iron spikes.

A pre-dawn rain of rockets on Kyiv shattered windows, left craters in buildings, and turned a 16-floor apartment house into a towering inferno. The fire spread quickly after a missile struck the building, blowing a jagged hole at its entrance. Firefighters rescued residents from windows by ladder through billowing smoke. By midafternoon, they had carried out two bodies encased in black bags.

“I came out with nothing,” said Mykola Fedkiv, 85, a retired geologist. “I left everything, my telephone, my medicines, everything.”

When the missile struck, Mr. Fedkiv fled his 12th-floor apartment and made his way down the stairs. He climbed through the blasted entrance hall and found himself in the bomb crater. People pulled him out by his arms. He stood outside for hours, hoping to re-enter his apartment to collect personal documents. Asked where he planned to stay the night, he responded, “God knows.”

Conditions were even more desperate in the coastal city of Mariupol, which has been pummeled by Russian forces in a two-week siege that has left some residents crushed in the rubble and many others dying in a winter freeze with no heat, food, or clean water. Officials can no longer account for the number of dead and missing.

Officially, 2,400 civilians killed in Mariupol have been identified, but Pyotr Andryushchenko, an adviser to the city government, said he believed the toll was far higher, possibly as many as 20,000. Ukrainian estimates of the number of people trapped have ranged from 200,000 to 400,000.

Mr. Andryushchenko said 2,000 vehicles had managed to escape Mariupol on Tuesday and that another 2,000 were packed and ready to leave. Officials told civilians to “delete all messages and photos from phones” in case Russian soldiers searched them for signs of support for Ukrainian forces.

The perils of reporting accurate information from Ukraine’s combat zones were further underscored Tuesday with news that a Fox News cameraman and a Ukrainian colleague had been killed in an attack on Monday outside Kyiv — raising to at least three the number of journalist fatalities in Ukraine in the past few days.

In Kherson, a southern city under Russian occupation, the mayor said that members of Russia’s national guard were rounding up activists who opposed Russia’s presence, possibly trying to recruit them through coercion.

“They’re all in the city, in the jail,” the mayor, Igor Kolykhaev, wrote in several text messages, referring to the activists. Russian troops, he said, “collect them, hold them, work them over and release them.”

Kherson was the first major city to fall to Russian forces after the Feb. 24 start of the invasion. Although Kremlin officials had predicted that the Ukrainian people would welcome their “liberation” by Russian troops, residents of Kherson have been defiant, regularly gathering in the central square to protest the Russian presence, even when Russian troops fire into the air to disperse them.

Russia claimed to have captured the entire Kherson region, potentially strengthening its ability to push west toward the strategic port cities of Mykolaiv and Odessa. A senior Ukrainian military official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that Russian forces were in control of much of the Kherson region, but said Ukrainian forces were attacking their positions and inflicting losses.

Negotiations via video link between Russia and Ukraine continued for a second day on Tuesday, though Mr. Putin doused prospects of any imminent breakthrough. In a phone call with the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, Mr. Putin complained that “Kyiv is not demonstrating a serious attitude toward finding mutually acceptable solutions,” according to the Kremlin.

Mr. Putin also continued to struggle in the information battle with Ukraine. On Tuesday, President Emmanuel Macron of France said his country could offer diplomatic “protection” to a Russian state television employee who was detained and fined over an on-air antiwar protest on Monday.

The employee, Marina Ovsyannikova, burst onto the live broadcast of Russia’s most-watched news program on Monday evening, yelling, “Stop the war!” and holding a sign that read, “They’re lying to you here.”

Russia also faced further isolation from Britain, which imposed sanctions on more than 370 people it labeled oligarchs, political allies of, or propagandists for Mr. Putin. Among those blacklisted: Dmitri A. Medvedev, the former president of Russia; Mikhail Mishustin, the current prime minister; and Mikhail Fridman, the billionaire founder of Alfa Bank, one of the country’s largest private banks.

Russia, for its part, said it had sanctioned 13 Americans including Mr. Biden, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III in response to American sanctions against Mr. Putin and other officials. Also on its list was Hillary Rodham Clinton, the former secretary of state, and Mr. Biden’s son, Hunter Biden.

Mr. Biden’s press secretary, Jen Psaki, shrugged off the news, suggesting in jest that the Kremlin’s announcement might have missed its intended mark. The president, Ms. Psaki said, is a “junior, so they might have sanctioned his dad by mistake.”

New military clothes were laid on top of his body, before the coffin lid was closed.

“My child is gone. There's no granddaughter or grandson. There's nothing. Life is empty now,” she wept.

The cadet with Ukraine's air defence forces had been stationed in the northeastern city of Kharkiv at the start of Russia's invasion. His mother, Irina, had been unable to reach him on the phone for nearly two weeks. Now the authorities had delivered his body back to his home town, Mykolaiv, for burial.

As the family waited for Eduard's coffin to be loaded into the back of a van, to be taken to a church, the occasional rumble of artillery was clearly audible.

More than 100 military bodies have passed through the town's main mortuary in the past three weeks, and more than 40 civilians. Nikolai, an attendant helping organise the bodies said in the past fortnight, he had been home only once.

“It's very intensive. We are not going home, we are living here. We are spending all our life here,” he said.

Mykolaiv, a ship-building city on Ukraine's Black Sea coast with around 450,000 inhabitants, has been under attack by Russian troops pushing into Ukraine from Crimea since nearly the start of the invasion. Taking the city would open a road to the port of Odesa, around 60 miles west.

The UK Ministry of Defence earlier this week reported that frustrated Russian forces may be attempting to now go round the city as they look to drive west towards Odesa. The port, once one of the jewels of imperial Russia, represents a significant prize for Vladimir Putin and would also choke off Ukraine's sea trade.

Yet while Russian forces may be skirting Mykolaiv, shells continue to fall on it.

8:36 p.m.: VOA White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara reports that President Joe Biden is expected to announce on Wednesday an additional $800 million in new security assistance to Ukraine, bringing the total announced in the past week alone to $2 billion, according to White House officials. The announcement will come on the same day Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is to speak to a joint session of the U.S. Congress.

7:32 p.m.: The U.S. Senate unanimously passed on Tuesday a resolution condemning Russian President Vladimir Putin as a war criminal, a rare show of unity in the deeply divided Congress. The resolution, introduced earlier this month by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and receiving bipartisan support, states the Senate “strongly condemns the ongoing violence, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and systematic human rights abuses continually being carried out by the Russian Armed Forces and their proxies and President Putin’s military commanders, at the direction of President Vladimir Putin.” It encouraged the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague and other nations to target the Russian military in any investigation of war crimes committed during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

7:09 p.m.: Ukraine Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal tweeted that the presence of Prime Ministers Petr Fiala of the Czech Republic, Janez Jansa of Slovenia and Mateusz Morawiecki of Poland, who traveled to Kyiv to meet with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy showed the “courage of true friends.”

6:04 p.m.: VOA’s Jeff Seldin shares the latest British defense briefing, which among its findings: “Russia is redeploying forces from as far afield as its Eastern Military District, Pacific Fleet and Armenia.”

5:35 p.m.: VOA’s Eastern Europe Chief Myroslava Gongadze, reporting from the Medyka border crossing in Poland, spoke with U.S. Embassy in Ukraine Charge d’Affaires Kristina Kvien. Kvien later tweeted “how Ukrainians are fighting an inspiring battle.”

4:42 p.m.: Dmitry Rogozin, head of Russia’s State Space Corporation called Roscosmos and the former deputy prime minister of Russia’s defense industry, tweeted Tuesday that “the only thing we can do to help our fighting army now is to clean out the Fifth Column” -- often defined as secret sympathizers of an enemy that engage in espionage or sabotage -- “And this is a task - perhaps even more important than the speed of advance of our army.”

3:58 p.m.: Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian children have become refugees since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty interviewed several Ukrainian refugee children in Poland and Lithuania and produced this report. The children offer their reflections on the horrors of war, and on politics.

3:42 p.m.: “A convoy of 11 trucks carrying 200 tons of aid from the International Committee of the Red Cross, the German Red Cross and other partners of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement has reached Ukraine,” according to an ICRC statement released Tuesday. “The assistance will soon be delivered to locations around the country based on security conditions, access and where the needs of civilians fleeing from and enduring conflict are most pressing. A priority will be to deliver assistance to people displaced from their homes and living in shelters,” the agency added.

3:28 p.m.: U.S. President Joe Biden signed a spending bill that includes nearly $14 billion in additional assistance to Ukraine Tuesday, and some top officials of his administration are crediting aid already provided by the United States with helping the Ukrainians hold off the Russian invaders, according to VOA’s Chief National Correspondent Steve Herman. Biden said the package — which contains military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine — comes on top of the $1.2 billion in U.S. security assistance already provided to the country. “With this new security funding and the drawdown authorities in this bill, we’re moving urgently to further augment the support to the brave people of Ukraine as they defend their country,” Biden said

3:11 p.m.: U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and State Department officials have been in touch with Fox News’ management, according to spokesperson Ned Price, regarding correspondent Benjamin Hall, who was injured Monday in Ukraine in an attack that killed two of his colleagues.

Russia said in its statement that “the measure is a response” to U.S. sanctions against Russian entities and individuals and that the action “became an inevitable consequence of an extremely Russo-phobic direction taken by the current U.S. administration.” Americans on the list won’t be able to travel to Russia starting on March 15. Russian authorities also threatened to expand the sanctions list to include lawmakers, experts, businessmen and media personalities that “encourage hate against Russia.”



Psaki downplayed the issue Tuesday, saying “None of us are planning tourist trips to Russia and none of us have bank accounts that we won’t be able to access.”

2:59 p.m.: In Donetsk, Ukraine, people are volunteering for a crash course in how to care for the wounded, as they seek ways to help during the current crisis. VOA’s Yaroslava Movchan has the story, narrated by Anna Rice.

2:48 p.m.: Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has prompted tens of thousands of middle-class Russians to flee abroad as they stare at a bleak future in their increasingly isolated homeland. But due to an ever-increasing number of crippling sanctions piled upon Russia, they don’t have many destinations to choose from, with many Western countries restricting visas for Russian citizens. Farangis Najibullah has this report for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

2:35 p.m.: Millions of Ukrainians have now fled their country, mostly to Poland, but also to Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Moldova. In Hungary, there are reports of some Ukrainians deciding to turn back. VOA’s Gabor Ancsin filed this report on Hungary’s border with Ukraine, narrated by Jon Spier.

2:26 p.m.: In Photos: Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine, March 15, 2022

2:21 p.m. : A Russian state media employee detained after her anti-war protest on live TV has appeared in court and was fined $280. Marina Ovsyannikova held up a sign during a live broadcast on Russian’s Channel One on Monday that read in Russian, “NO WAR. Stop the war. Don’t believe propaganda. They are lying to you.” The bottom line, in English, read, “Russians against war.” She was accused of violating the country’s protest laws. It is unclear if she will face additional charges. VOA News reports.

2:21 p.m.: More than 100 buses carrying civilians have left the besieged city of Sumy in northeastern Ukraine for a safe area, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said Tuesday. “In total, more than 100 buses are traveling in two different convoys, a joint operation between us and the Ukrainian Red Cross,” ICRC spokesperson Jason Straziuso told Reuters in Geneva. The buses were heading towards Poltava, in central Ukraine, but might not be able to take a direct route, he said, adding that the Russian side had given a green light for the evacuation.

2:08 p.m.: The United States on Tuesday announced more sanctions on Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko for his role as an ally of Russia during the invasion of Ukraine. The sanctions will block Lukashenko and his wife from accessing U.S. property and limit the ability of Americans to conduct business with them. The U.S. has already sanctioned Lukashenko over the Ukraine invasion, including limiting technological exports.

2 p.m.: The prime ministers of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia arrived in Kyiv to meet with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday.

1:56 p.m.: Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty asked Muscovites on the last day of McDonald’s operations in Russia if they would miss the popular fast food chain. McDonald’s has announced it is temporarily closing all its stores inside Russia in response to the invasion of Ukraine.

1:41 p.m.: Russia on Tuesday formally quit the Council of Europe, a human rights watchdog based in Strasbourg, pre-empting possible expulsion over its attack on its neighbor Ukraine, according to Reuters. Pyotr Tolstoy, head of the Russian delegation at the Council’s Parliamentary Assembly, handed a letter from Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to the Council’s secretary general announcing Moscow’s decision, the Tass news agency reported.

1:15 p.m.: U.S. President Joe Biden is now scheduled to travel to Brussels to attend a NATO summit March 24, as VOA’s White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara reports.

1:10 p.m.: In a briefing Tuesday, White House spokesperson Jen Psaki paid tribute to FOX News cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski, who was killed following an attack in Ukraine Monday. “He was a war zone photographer who covered nearly every international story for Fox News, from Iraq to Afghanistan to Syria during his long tenure working there,” Psaki said. “Our thoughts, our prayers are with his family, with the entire community as well.” VOA’s Press Freedom Editor Jessica Jerreat reports that as a result of the same attack, Zakrzewski died as did Ukrainian journalist Oleksandra Kuvshynova, while Fox News correspondent Benjamin Hall was injured and remains hospitalized.

12:45 p.m.: A Russian state media employee has been released from detention after protesting Russia’s war in Ukraine on live TV, VOA’s Press Freedom Editor Jessica Jerreat reported Tuesday. Speaking to journalists after her release, Marina Ovsyannikova says she was questioned for 14 hours and denied access to a lawyer or her family. She was fined 30,000 roubles ($280) for breaking protest laws, according to the RIA news agency. The fine is believed to be related to a video she posted online before her anti-war protest during a live broadcast on Russia’s Channel One studio on Monday.

12:35 p.m.: A second journalist was reported to have died Tuesday, following an attack on her media team in Ukraine on Monday. The Vienna-based International Press Institute said that Ukrainian journalist Oleksandra Kuvshynova was killed alongside veteran cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski. FOX News correspondent Benjamin Hall was injured in the attack. The U.S. broadcaster says the vehicle they were in was struck by incoming fire.

12:26 p.m.: Ukraine has come under 3,000 cyberattacks since Febuary 15, Victor Zhora, deputy chair of the country’s State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection, told journalists in a briefing Tuesday, as VOA’s Jamie Dettmer reports.



Russia is focusing its cyberattacks on Ukraine’s critical infrastructure in the digital war, targeting the public and financial sectors and telecommunications, Zhora said. It has been seeking to disrupt Ukraine military communications and the military’s communication with Ukraine’s political leaders, he added.



Russia’s cyberwar campaign has mainly been comprised of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. But he confirmed there have also been so-called wiper attacks, overwriting or removing data from the Ukrainian systems targeted.



Zhora said Ukraine’s cyber-defenses have benefited from volunteer groups. “Specialists have self organized and are working to help on the cyber front,” he said. Ukraine is focused on its own cyber-defense and is not mounting cyber-attacks on Russia, Zhora said. But he acknowledged hacker groups have been doing so, saying he is “grateful for their efforts.”

12:14 p.m.: VOA’s Eastern Europe Chief Myroslava Gongadze reports from an international aid station for refugees at the Poland-Ukraine border.

For the past few years, Russia’s disinformation apparatus has seemed unstoppable. But as Russia’s armed forces have been caught wrong-footed on the battlefield in Ukraine by a smaller, agile and more motivated opponent, so, too, its propaganda operation has seemed flat-footed. The storylines promulgated by the Kremlin at it seeks to shift blame for its own actions on to others, and to cast its invasion as defensive in nature, have struggled to gain the traction Russian propagandists might have expected, they say. VOA’s Jamie Dettmer has more.

11:51 a.m.: The American network FOX News on Tuesday announced that journalist Pierre Zakrzewski died from injuries sustained in an attack in Horenka, near Kyiv, on Monday. Zakrzewski was with FOX correspondent Benjamin Hall when their vehicle was struck by incoming fire, FOX chief executive Suzanne Scott said in a statement to staff. Hall, a British American journalist, remains in the hospital, where he is being treated for injuries.

11:45 a.m.: China says it does not want to get caught up in the diplomatic and economic blowback Russia is facing from Western nations over its invasion of Ukraine.

11:33 a.m.: Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmygal said on Tuesday the government would finance a loan program for farmers worth $846 million as part of a raft of new measures to ease the economic shock of war, Reuters reports. In a video address, Shmygal also outlined new tax breaks for small and medium-sized businesses that were approved earlier by parliament.



11:24 a.m.: A senior German official predicted Tuesday that the war in Ukraine and its impact on fossil fuel prices worldwide will provide a “massive boost” for the means and measures needed to curb climate change, The Associated Press reports.



Patrick Graichen, Germany’s deputy energy and climate minister, said rising global prices for oil, gas and coal will accelerate the uptake of low-emission technology that simultaneously reduces countries’ reliance on imports from Russia.



“The core technologies to become independent of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and to drive forward climate protection are the same,” he told reporters in Berlin. “They are renewables, they are efficiency, and electrification,” said Graichen. “These three will now get a massive boost,” he added.

11:15 a.m.: On Tuesday, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba posted on Twitter a photo of himself smiling next to Lithuania’s Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis. He said it was the first official visit by a foreign minister since Russia invaded Ukraine. The visit comes on the same day that the prime ministers of the Czech Republic, Poland, and Slovenia are traveling to Kyiv in an ""unequivocal"" show of support to Ukraine.

10:53 a.m.: The State Department announced sanctions on 11 key members of Russia’s defense enterprise Tuesday, adding to a long list of sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other western countries following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. VOA’s Correspondent Nike Ching has the details.

10:36 a.m.: An overwhelming majority of refugees from Ukraine are fleeing to European Union countries. Ukrainians already enjoy visa-free travel to the European Union for up to 90 days. Recently, the European Union’s executive branch, the European Commission, activated the Temporary Protection Directive, which grants immediate protection to those fleeing the war while providing access to schools, medical care, and work. VOA’s Immigration Correspondent Aline Barros reports on what this means for the millions of Ukrainian refugees on the move.

10:21 a.m.: Russia will put forth its own draft of a resolution regarding the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, Moscow's ambassador to the United Nations said on Tuesday. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia also said Russia will stop its invasion when the goals of its special military operation are achieved in Ukraine, including demilitarization.



Meanwhile, the sponsors of a draft Security Council resolution on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, that has been in negotiation for two weeks, said they will not seek a vote in the council but will take it to the wider membership in the General Assembly. “Obviously, it would have been difficult in the Security Council, no need to explain to you why,” France’s envoy Nicolas de Riviere said in response to a reporter’s question. Russia holds a veto in the 15-nation council.



“We think it’s time to take action to move to the General Assembly and have the whole membership supporting an initiative on humanitarian access, on cessation of hostilities, on respect of international humanitarian law, on respect of the Geneva Conventions,” Ambassador de Riviere said. “So, we are very optimistic we can do that. The sooner the better. The situation on the ground deteriorates by the hour.” VOA’s UN Correspondent Margaret Besheer is following the developments.

9:54 a.m.: While tens of thousands of people have fled Ukraine every day since Russia’s invasion, a small but growing number of women are heading in the other direction, The Associated Press reports.

Motivated by a desire to help loved ones in trouble or contribute to the defense and survival of their country, these women are braving the bombs and heading into Ukraine.



“I will go back and help. I am a health worker, so the hospitals need help,” said Iryna Orel, 50, tugging her luggage before boarding a train from Przemysl, Poland, to Lviv, in western Ukraine. “And I will stay until the end.”



“I am returning to Ukraine to help people evacuate too,” said Maria Khalica, who lives in Italy but was planning to travel to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. “I am in a more stable state now than my friends, who are under rocket attacks and bombs.”

With Ukraine’s government ordering men to stay and fight, the vast majority of people fleeing Ukraine have been women, children and the elderly, according to national officials and the U.N. refugee agency.

9:33 a.m.: As Russia’s President Vladimir Putin continues his crackdown on media outlets, many observers are asking how members of the Russian public are getting their news about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Natasha Yefimova-Trilling is a news editor at Russia Matters, a project at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center that provides research and analysis on Russia and U.S.-Russia relations to policymakers and the public. In an interview in The Harvard Gazette, she cites recent research and anecdotal evidence to examine the media landscape in Russia now.



9:21 a.m.: The prime ministers of the Czech Republic, Poland, and Slovenia are traveling to Kyiv on Tuesday in an ""unequivocal"" show of support to Ukraine as Russia continues its assault on the country. The three leaders will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Prime Minister Denis Shmyhal.



Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, and Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa are traveling to Kyiv by train and crossed from Poland into Ukraine before noon, Michal Dwoczyk, an aide to Moraweicki, told reporters. The Polish leader called it a historic mission.



The three leaders will arrive in a city that is still under bombardment, forcing many people to spend nights sheltering in underground stations. Hosting the foreign prime ministers in his own capital would be a symbolic success for Zelenskiy, who has stayed in Kyiv to rally his nation with nightly messages. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has the story.

9:12 a.m.: There were more Russian attacks on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv Tuesday, with shells hitting several residential buildings. At least two high-rise buildings in the Svyatoshyn district were heavily damaged and set ablaze. Correspondent Levko Stek, with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, reported from the site of another attack in the city’s Kurenivka district that killed one person and injured 10 on Monday. He spoke with Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko, who said the attacks were further proof that Russian forces are targeting civilians.

8:56 a.m.: A lawyer representing the Russian state media employee detained for her anti-war protest on live TV, says he cannot find his client, VOA Press Freedom Editor Jessica Jerreat reported Tuesday.



Marina Ovsyannikova held up a sign during a live broadcast on Russia’s Channel One on Monday, that read in Russian: “NO WAR. Stop the war. Don’t believe propaganda. They are lying to you.” The bottom line in English, read, “Russians against war.”



Ovsyannikova could face charges under a law that bans discrediting the armed forces, according to Russia’s Tass state news agency. Ovsyannikova was detained but her lawyer Pavel Chikov says more than 12 hours later she still has not been located. He added on social media that the police investigation does not include “grounds for detention and imprisonment.""

The Kremlin on Tuesday said Ovsyannikova’s actions amount to “hooliganism,” Reuters reported. A spokesperson for the U.N. Human Rights Office said at a briefing Tuesday Russia should ensure that Ovsyannikova “does not face any reprisals for exercising her right to freedom of expression.”

8:45 a.m.: Memorable reports illustrate both the skill and gutsiness of female journalists serving as eyewitnesses to Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine and the way their presence — hard-won after overcoming ingrained notions of why women shouldn’t cover combat — has changed the nature of war reporting. They cover the tactics of war but give equal measure to its toll.

8:30a.m.: Kyiv’s mayor Vitali Klitschko has announced a 35-hour curfew for Ukraine’s battered capital starting at 6pm local time Tuesday to 7am Thursday following heavy bombing that left several high-rise apartment blocks badly damaged in the Svyatoshynskyi and Podilskyi districts. The mayor confirmed that four people died in the airstrikes Tuesday morning. One 15-story apartment block was engulfed in a blaze, VOA’s Jamie Dettmer writes from Warsaw, Poland.



Klitschko said special permission would be required to move around the city without special permission. “The capital is the heart of Ukraine, and it will be defended. Kyiv, which is currently the symbol and forward operating base of Europe’s freedom and security, will not be given up by us,” he added. Also Tuesday, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy issued a life or death ultimatum to Russian soldiers, urging them to surrender.

Ukraine planned to make a new attempt to deliver supplies to the besieged city of Mariupol on Tuesday as the first convoy of civilians allowed out by Russia reached safety and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) issued a dire warning about the situation, Reuters reports.



Also Tuesday, the Red Cross said it is hoping to organize the evacuation of two convoys of some 30 buses with civilians out of the besieged northeastern Ukrainian city of Sumy and their passage to a safe area.



Ewan Watson, a Red Cross spokesperson, told a U.N. briefing in Geneva that the operation would be carried out with the Ukrainian Red Cross but was not underway yet. He noted there had been delays with similar evacuations from Mariupol, where he said people are “essentially being suffocated in this city now with no aid.”

7:37 a.m.: The International Organization for Migration says more than 3 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded last month, The Associated Press reports. The new milestone also indicated that some 157,000 third-country nationals – people who are not Ukrainian – were part of the outflow in what U.N. officials have called the largest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.



IOM spokesman Paul Dillon said at a U.N. news briefing in Geneva on Tuesday that the totals were compiled from figures provided by national authorities.



The U.N. refugee agency UNHCR, which provides a more detailed count than the IOM though based on similar data, has reported that more than 1.8 million of the refugees were in Poland. UNHCR spokesman Matthew Saltmarsh said some 300,000 had moved on from there to Western Europe and noted that the vast majority of those fleeing have been women and children.

6:47 a.m.: Russian officials have said that they will move to nationalize the assets of Western companies that pull out of their country over its invasion of Ukraine. But White House press secretary Jen Psaki warned that Russia could face further sanctions or legal action if it goes forward with the nationalization plan. ""Any lawless decision by Russia to seize the assets of these companies will ultimately result in even more economic pain for Russia,"" she wrote. VOA’s Rob Garver has this story.

6:20 a.m.: Some analysts say China is trying to buy time until it is able to come up with the appropriate policy response to the changing situation in the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Friday said the U.S. and China should not “close” a cultural door between the countries as economic sanctions against neighboring Russia intensify. Though the sanctions target Russian trade, they will have wide-ranging impact on Chinese companies and banks that deal with Russian entities. For VOA, Saibal Dasgupta reports from New Delhi.

5:30 a.m.: The battle over Ukraine’s fate is happening on multiple fronts, with U.S. officials flying around the globe to meet with civilians who have been affected by the carnage, but also speaking virtually and in person with officials from other countries who have a role to play in ending this conflict.

4:27 a.m.: Britain’s Foreign Office is investigating reports that three former British army servicemen were among the 35 killed in a Russian missile strike Sunday on a military training base in western Ukraine near the Polish border, VOA’s Jamie Dettmer reports from Warsaw, Poland. All three men reportedly were formerly members of the U.K.’s special forces.

It is now estimated by Ukrainian authorities that at least a dozen missiles struck the facility, one of Ukraine’s biggest military training camps, located 25 kilometers from the Polish border. Ukrainian air-defense batteries intercepted other missiles as they hurtled towards the base at Yavoriv, 60 kilometers from Lviv, a major hub for Ukrainian evacuees fleeing the country.

The strike on the International Center for Peacekeeping and Security is the westernmost attack by Russia so far, and has raised fears that Lviv may soon embroiled in the conflict.

The report said the economy is expected to shrink by 10% in 2022, but that could become worse depending on the length of the conflict. The IMF is expected to approve $1.4 billion in emergency funding for the country.

The IMF applauded Ukraine’s efforts to keep its financial system functioning and to fulfill its obligations despite the crisis.

“Making wage and pension payments, restocking ATMs with cash, opening bank branches ... continuing to make payments on external debt obligations, so that post-war they can resume normal operations with their creditors and markets. It’s really actually a remarkable, remarkable effort,” Ivanna Vladkova Hollar, the IMF mission chief for Ukraine said, according to Reuters.

1:15 a.m.: Negotiators from Russia and Ukraine are due to hold more talks Tuesday as Russia presses its nearly three-week invasion with bombardments of Kyiv and other major Ukrainian cities.

A round of negotiations Monday, held by video rather than in-person in neighboring Belarus like previous sessions, yielded still no major signs of a breakthrough.

Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted after Monday’s talks, “Communication is being held yet it’s hard.” He had raised hope of progress on Sunday by saying Russia had been “listening carefully to our proposals” and was beginning to talk “constructively.”

12:51 a.m.: An employee of Russian state-run Channel One interrupted a live broadcast of the nightly news Monday shouting “Stop the war! No to war!”

News staffer Marina Ovysannikova, whose father is Ukrainian, held up a placard in Russian, saying, “Don’t believe the propaganda. They’re lying to you here.” Studio producers rushed to cut her off, VOA’s Jamie Dettmer reports.

This is the second time Russian One has had a problem controlling the message. Last week, on the popular talk show hosted by Vladimir Soloviyev, two pundits broke ranks and likened the war raging in Ukraine to Russia’s quagmire in Afghanistan in the 1990s.

During the broadcast filmmaker Karen Shakhnazarov said Russia’s invasion risked isolating the country. He called for the war to stop, and warned: “If this picture starts to transform into an absolute humanitarian disaster, even our close allies like China and India will be forced to distance themselves from us.”

Later during the broadcast guest Semyon Bagdasarov, an academic, said: “Do we need to get into another Afghanistan, but even worse?”

Zelenskyy wrote: “May Brent’s life & sacrifice inspire the world to stand up in fight for the forces of light against forces of darkness.”

VOA’s Eastern Europe Chief Myroslava Gongadze reflects on her friend and former Nieman fellow.

Renaud went to Ukraine to report on refugees feeling the conflict. He was shot dead, and his colleague, Juan Arredondo, who was with him when they came under fire, was injured. VOA’s press freedom editor Jessica Jerreat reports.

MR PRICE: Good afternoon.

QUESTION: Good afternoon.

MR PRICE: As we have noted in recent days and recent hours, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is beginning. Hours after Russia recognized the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics as, quote/unquote, “independent,” President Putin authorized Russian troops to enter those regions. He has taken other steps that amount to a direct assault on Ukraine’s sovereignty.

We responded in turn quickly and decisively. Within less than a day, we’d announced the first tranche of sanctions with our allies and partners, including those in the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, and Australia.

Our German allies, yesterday, took resolute action to ensure that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, what had been a prized $11 billion investment on the part of the Russian Federation, is suspended indefinitely. And as you have just seen, President Biden today authorized sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG and its corporate office-holders. We have now taken complementary action using our own authorities to ensure that Nord Stream 2 is off the table, just as we said it would be.

In lockstep with our allies, we are blocking from the global financial system two large banks that are connected to the Kremlin and Russian military, and Russian sovereign wealth can no longer trade on U.S. or European financial markets. As you all know, we additionally sanctioned Russian elites, those elites who are in many ways complicit.

This is the beginning of our response. If Putin escalates further, we will escalate further using additional sanctions and export controls, which we’ve yet to unveil but are fully prepared to implement with allies and partners across the globe.

The sequence of events that Secretary Blinken laid out at the UN Security Council last week appears to be proceeding exactly as he laid out. We’ve seen false flags, we’ve seen provocations, we’ve seen theatrically staged meetings at the Kremlin, we’ve seen cyber operations, and the list goes on.

So where do we go from here? Moscow needs to demonstrate that it’s serious about diplomacy. Russia’s actions over the last 48 hours have, in fact, demonstrated the opposite. If Moscow’s approach changes, we remain ready to engage.

The United States and our allies and partners remain open to diplomacy. We are eager to engage to avert what would be a brutal and costly conflict, but as we have said, diplomacy cannot succeed unless Russia changes course.

As we have said, we are prepared. We are prepared for any contingency going forward.

Matt.

QUESTION: Okay. Thanks. I have a question about the Houthi sanctions, but it’s largely semantic, so I’ll leave it ‘til later.

On Nord Stream 2, you guys had been saying for months – indeed, for over a year, since the waivers were first granted – that in fact this gave you additional leverage, withholding the sanctions did, and would serve as a deterrent. Clearly it didn’t – they didn’t provide you with any leverage at all that we can tell, because of what you just said in your opening statement about the invasion beginning. So how do you explain to people why you didn’t impose these sanctions earlier?

MR PRICE: So Matt, it’s important – and let’s just rewind the tape and remember what has happened in recent hours. Yesterday, within a short timeframe of the Russian invasion beginning, Germany took decisive, resolute action to take Nord Stream 2 off the table. Today, we followed with our own complementary authorities using the powers and capabilities that we have.

We have always said in the context of Nord Stream 2, in the context of the steps that we are taking with partners and allies around the world, that one of the most important tools we have in our arsenal is transatlantic unity. The fact that Germany acted so quickly, so decisively, is in many ways a product of the coordination of the consultation we have done now with two successive German governments. Of course, this started with Chancellor Merkel and her government, and in more recent months we have had concerted discussions with Chancellor Scholz and his government.

The fact that we are acting in unison immediately to take these steps that essentially remove Nord Stream 2 from the equation – that is a byproduct, that is a result of the work that we have done together with the German Government over the course of these last several months, over the course of the last year or so.

QUESTION: So it sounds to me – and correct me if I’m wrong – that your argument is that if you had imposed the sanctions earlier, the Germans wouldn’t have suspended – done – the Germans wouldn’t have done what they did yesterday, or it would have been a much bigger lift to get them to do that.

MR PRICE: What we have said, and our – what —

QUESTION: (Off-mike.)

MR PRICE: Our strategy has been predicated on the knowledge that transatlantic unity is the most powerful instrument we have.

QUESTION: That’s fine, but I don’t – but look, the pipeline’s already been built, okay? Now, whether it gets turned on or not is another —

MR PRICE: Well, but —

QUESTION: — is another question.

MR PRICE: Right. So you —

QUESTION: But presumably you had more leverage – and I don’t understand why you don’t think that you would have had more leverage if it hadn’t been – if these sanctions had been imposed before the pipeline was finished.

MR PRICE: So, Matt, you also raise a good point. The pipeline, when this administration came into office, was more than 90 percent complete. We have imposed sanctions under PEESA on a number of targets associated with this pipeline, persons and entities. But the fact is that had we sanctioned Nord Stream 2 AG, had we sanctioned its corporate office holders, it is far from clear that that would have kept the pipeline from going into operation. What the Germans did yesterday was to ensure that the pipeline is no longer part of the equation.

QUESTION: Right.

MR PRICE: So by acting together with the Germans how we did, when we did, and the way in which we did, we have ensured that this is an $11 billion prize investment that is now a hunk of steel sitting at the bottom of the sea.

QUESTION: All right, well, I don’t think you, though, can prove – and the converse can’t be proven either. But you just don’t know if imposing the sanctions earlier would have had more of a deterrent effect or any deterrent effect —

MR PRICE: Well, if we would have made it a sunk cost many, many months ago for the Russian Federation, I don’t think that would have had much deterrent capability.

QUESTION: Well, it hasn’t anyway, so I’ll leave it there.

MR PRICE: Simon.

QUESTION: Yeah, the Secretary obviously said yesterday he had canceled his meeting with Foreign Minister Lavrov, but you guys remain open to diplomacy. So what exactly would you want to see from Russia in order to reschedule that meeting, in order to resume some kind of diplomacy, diplomatic talks between you? And just an additional one: You’ve sort of – this is the last – or this is part of the first tranche of sanctions, the Nord Stream 2 sanctions that just came out. Is that the end of the first tranche or is there more coming in that? And can you say whether more sanctions actions will be taken if Russia doesn’t escalate further from where it is now?

MR PRICE: Well, the question you ask is what we would like to see. Let me tell you – let me start by answering that question by letting you know what we no longer will engage in, and that is the pretense of diplomacy. You heard the Secretary use that phrase yesterday, and that is what we have seen. This is and has been, in some ways, diplomatic kabuki theater on the part of the Russians – making statements that they are committed to a diplomatic path while their actions suggest exactly the opposite. That is not an environment in which diplomacy can achieve the results that it needs to achieve.

Our goal here, even as the Russian invasion of Ukraine is beginning, is to avert the worst-case scenario, the worst-case scenario that we have warned about for some time now. And we have gone into great detail in terms of what that could look like: electronic warfare; the – a fuller-scale invasion, an attack on major urban centers, including Kyiv, a city of 2.9 million people; horrific human rights abuses, atrocities, potential war crimes. These are all things that, even as the invasion is beginning, we are going to do everything that we reasonably can to prevent from happening.

And so that’s why, together with our allies and partners, we absolutely remain open to diplomacy, but only if Moscow is serious. We are not going to engage in this pretense with them during which they draw out the process – suggest one thing, do another, ready their preparations, move their forces closer to the border, develop and refine their plans – as they give the world a head fake that they are actually committed to the diplomatic path.

Now, there are a number of ways that Moscow could indicate that it is serious. It essentially boils down to de-escalation. That would be the most concrete, the clearest indication that diplomacy has the potential to bear fruit, that diplomacy has the potential to save lives. That is the kind of diplomacy we are interested in. That is also not the kind of diplomacy that we have seen any indication, as of yet, that Moscow is interested in.

Vivian.

QUESTION: Can you comment on the reports that the U.S. informed the Ukrainian Government that an attack could happen as soon as tonight and that Kharkiv is possibly in the line of attack, that it could be directly – that the Russian troops could roll over the border and attack Kharkiv tonight?

MR PRICE: What I’ll say about those reports is they are entirely consistent with what we have been saying for some time now: that Russia has amassed forces along Ukraine’s borders, in Belarus; positioned the assets, the heavy weaponry, the soldiers, the service members it would need to undertake an invasion of Ukraine at a moment’s notice. That has been true for some time now.

So for several days now, we have said the invasion is potentially imminent, meaning it could start today. It could start tomorrow; it could start next week. What we haven’t seen is – and this goes back to Simon’s question – is any indication that the Russians are backing away from this. We have not seen any data points that alleviate the grave concern, the profound concern that we’ve been expressing for some time yet – some time now. So the invasion remains potentially imminent, and Moscow is poised to do precisely the kinds of things that you just outlined.

QUESTION: Can I just follow up real quickly also on something Simon said, that you and Simon discussed? With this notion of diplomacy still on the table and now you’re saying that it’s possible that – Donbas is obviously being attacked if not actually, then rhetorically; that the Russians are now acknowledging or recognizing their autonomy and sovereignty. So how can you then justify discussions about diplomacy when this is underway? I mean, you keep on saying that the Russians have to show that they’re serious. They have to de-escalate. But could they pause things right now and possibly engage in talks with the U.S., or do significant sort of scale-back have to happen? Do we have to see troops falling back before that’s discussed? Is Donbas being regarded differently from the rest of the country?

MR PRICE: So you heard from our colleagues at the White House and others here over the course of the day yesterday, including the Secretary, that the invasion is beginning. And when we spoke about the beginning of the invasion, we talked about several developments over the course of that 24-hour period: Vladimir Putin’s recognition of the so-called DNR and LNR; the order that he conveyed to the ministry of defense to deploy forces into the Donbas; the authorization that he sought to send Russian servicemembers into service extraterritorially; the rhetorical assault, essentially, that we saw President Putin deliver against Ukraine denying Ukraine its sovereignty and, essentially, its right to exist. Those are what we’ve seen. Those are what we’ve heard.

But as I just mentioned, there are some things – many things, in fact – that Russia is poised to do at a moment’s notice that we have not yet seen. A large-scale invasion, an assault on urban centers, the human rights abuses, the potential war crimes, the atrocities that we have great concern could take place, these are all things that we want to prevent.

So you asked the question, why would we engage in diplomacy? Well, we would engage in diplomacy to save lives. We would engage in diplomacy to prevent an all-out war. This is a war that would be brutal. It would be costly. It would be in many ways devastating for the Russian Federation, of course for the Ukrainian people. And the way in which the Russian Federation would wage this war, you heard from the National Security Advisor, it would not be a type of conflict that you might imagine over territory or over concrete ends. You heard the National Security Advisor make the case that this would be a war waged against the Ukrainian people to subjugate them, to crush them, to exact in many ways revenge.

This is what we want to prevent. So we are ready to engage, but we need a partner. We need a negotiating counterpart that demonstrates seriousness of purpose. We have not seen that from the Russian Federation; in fact, we have seen the opposite at every turn.

Andrea?

QUESTION: Ned, do we have diplomats right now in Lviv? Or are they spending their nights in Poland and going back and forth? Have we made any kind of commitment to the safe passage, to any kind of extraction, if you will, for key members of the Zelenskyy government, if necessary? And what would be our commitment to any insurgency that developed, given if it were a full-scale invasion, if any? I mean, there was training. There was support.

And one final question —

MR PRICE: I should write these down.

QUESTION: Sorry. Your reaction to former Secretary of State Pompeo and former President Trump praising Putin’s cleverness, strength, and smartness in the last couple of days?

MR PRICE: I’ll start with that one. I have no response. In fact, I have no words.

To move on to Lviv, I think what you heard from us on Sunday is that the Secretary had determined that it was in the best interests, in the best interests of the safety and security of our team on the ground, for them to temporarily relocate into Poland. They have been spending the night in Poland, but they have been regularly essentially commuting back into Lviv. Our chargé, Kristina Kvien, has been leading the team back on the ground in Lviv. We have every expectation that they will continue to do so as long as the security environment remains permissive.

When they’re on the ground in Lviv, they’re able to undertake emergency consular services to help Americans who may be seeking to leave the country. They are engaging with our Ukrainian partners, and they have important missions that they’re able to fulfill in Lviv.

But regardless of whether they’re in Lviv, whether they are in Poland, that in no way changes the commitment we have to our Ukrainian partners. It in no way diminishes the partnership we have with Kyiv. We’ve remained in constant contact with our partners in the Ukrainian Government, and that takes me to your question about any advice we may have passed on to the Zelenskyy government.

The fact is that we are in contact with our friends and counterparts in Kyiv on a daily basis. As you know, Foreign Minister Kuleba was here yesterday. The President had an opportunity to speak to President Zelenskyy over the weekend. The Secretary was in the Oval Office for that call. The president, President Zelenskyy and his team, know that they have the steadfast and unwavering support of the United States. Of course, our goal in all of this is to avert that worst-case scenario, the worst-case scenario that we’ve already talked about in the course of this briefing. The fact is that the president and his team will make decisions in the coming days best – based on the best interests of their country and their people. The foreign minister was asked a question about this just yesterday. He provided an insight into their thinking. But these will be decisions that our Ukrainian counterparts will make based on their own determinations and their own calculus.

In terms of our – let me put it this way. In terms of our continued assistance to our Ukrainian partners, the President has made very clear that in the event of a Russian invasion – which, as we have said, is beginning – we will not only continue our defensive security assistance to our Ukrainian partners, but we will double down on it. So on top of the unprecedented level of defensive security assistance that we provided to our Ukrainian partners over the last year – $650 million, including a $200 million drawdown that the President signed in December, deliveries of which continue to flow into Kyiv, flow into Ukraine I should say – we will continue – not only continue to provide that support, but we will look to further that defensive security assistance for our Ukrainian partners.

Kylie.

QUESTION: I’m just wondering if Russia has responded at all to Blinken’s letter yesterday and what diplomatic conversations between the U.S. and Russia have looked like in the last 24 hours.

MR PRICE: What I’ll say is we – the Secretary laid out for Foreign Minister Lavrov in a private communication the fact that, under the current circumstances and what we have seen from the Russian Federation so far, our conclusion that a meeting this week in Geneva would not serve the purpose that any such meeting would need to serve. And first and foremost, that is to avert a brutal, massive, costly conflict. The Russians, and all of you later, heard that publicly from Secretary Blinken. The Russians know precisely our position. They know through private communications and through our own public messaging that we stand ready to engage diplomatically if they are willing to do so in good faith, and if they are willing to change their posture we will be ready, willing, and able to engage them on this.

QUESTION: And did the Secretary detail what “in good faith” would look like in this letter, or was it broad descriptions like you just gave?

MR PRICE: We are not going to be prescriptive in terms of what de-escalation might look like, what good faith might look like. We have been very clear – because all of you know, presumably our counterparts in the Russian Federation know – what steps might look like if they were interested in signaling de-escalation. We have not seen any of those steps. And again, we have seen steps that actually move in the opposite direction.

QUESTION: And then just a last question. Can or will the U.S. keep open our embassy in Moscow if there is a full-scale invasion into Ukraine?

MR PRICE: We believe, in times of conflict, in times of crisis, that the ability to communicate is in some ways even more imperative. Now, long before the massive Russian military buildup started along Ukraine’s borders, in Belarus, of course, our team on the ground in Moscow and throughout Russia, they were in a very difficult operating environment – a very difficult operating environment because of the restrictions that the Russian Federation had imposed on them. It will be our goal to be in a position to maintain diplomatic communication, the ability to convey clearly any messages that we need to send to the Russian Federation. Embassies are an important tool in that, but we have also seen the Russian Federation even in recent days escalate on an unprovoked and needless basis the bilateral challenges in terms of our own diplomatic staffing in Moscow and our ability to operate an embassy on the ground. But again, we believe communication, we believe the ability to pass messages is even more important in times of great crisis.

QUESTION: Ned, on Nord Stream, are you working with the Germans to find alternative sources of energy for them? I mean, it seems like the pipeline is not going to go full – or going to go operational anytime soon, so are you working with them, with the Qataris or any other potential suppliers, perhaps in Algeria and so on, and about the means to get it there?

And I have a quick question on the diplomacy.

MR PRICE: Sure. Let me start with your question on the energy, and of course, this was something that President Biden discussed yesterday. We have been frank, we have been candid with the American people that our measures – the measures we have and are prepared to impose on the Russian Federation – certainly won’t be cost-free for the Russian Federation, but they won’t be entirely cost-free for the rest of the world as well. And so that is why we are working with countries around the world, executing a plan with major producing and consuming countries to secure the stability of global energy supplies, whether that’s oil, whether that’s LNG.

For energy consumers – and you heard this from Deputy National Security Advisor Daleep Singh yesterday – he made the point that we all have strategic reserves at our disposal, and those reserves we know could support the supply of global energy. The White House announced such a move late last year. There are other countries that have their own strategic supplies. For energy producers, we know that many of them have spare capacity to provide supply to global markets that could balance those markets in the event of any supply disruption.

More broadly, we’ve been very clear with the Russian Federation that any further attempt to weaponize energy, to constrict flows with malign geopolitical intent or purpose, would have massive consequences and, to your point, would only further the longstanding effort to diversify energy supplies for Europe and the rest of the world. We have heard from a number of countries, including Japan, including Australia, including Slovakia, that they are taking concrete steps in terms of global energy markets. We expect other countries will have announcements of their own. We also know that the International Energy Agency has announced that it’s monitoring and consulting with member states to ensure market stability going forward.

But to the question about diversification of supply, this has been a longstanding goal of ours. And to go back to the question of Nord Stream 2, there was the communiqué that together we drafted and finalized with the German Government over the summer, in the summer of July of 2021. It laid out a series of steps that Germany committed to taking with Ukraine to help Ukraine diversify its supply of energy, cognizant that Russia had weaponized energy flows in the past and Russia might have been looking to do so again in the future. If Russia were to take that step, we’ve been very clear about the massive consequences that would befall it.

QUESTION: Very quickly to follow up on Kylie’s and your response to her on diplomacy. So are you urging the Ukrainians not to cut off relations with Russia? Because there was talk that they might cut off all diplomatic relations with Russia.

MR PRICE: That’s a decision for the Ukrainian Government to make.

QUESTION: Of course, but are you bringing them – I mean, if they decided to cut off their relations with Russia, you wouldn’t say, “No, don’t do it now” or “Go ahead, do it”?

MR PRICE: That is a decision for the Ukrainian Government to make. Again, the Russian Federation has launched an assault on Ukraine’s sovereignty, on its territorial integrity, in many different ways and many different forms. But the decision as to whether to continue diplomatic relations between Kyiv and Moscow, that’s something that Kyiv will have to decide.

QUESTION: Ned, on the diplomacy, I’m curious about your reference publicly from the podium to what the Russians have been doing as kabuki theater. What specifically are you referring to? The meeting in Geneva between Secretary Blinken and Foreign Minister Lavrov? The UN Security Council meeting last week or even – whatever it was – a day or two ago? The Russian National Security – the —

MR PRICE: So I think you could point to any number of steps. The – what comes to my mind immediately was the dramatic, theatrical scene we saw – I guess it was last week now – between President Putin and his deputies, in which they had what was scripted, I assume, to be a pretty candid exchange indicating that the Russian Federation should pursue diplomacy, only as, at that very moment and in the days that followed, we saw additional Russian forces go to the border.

QUESTION: Right, but that —

MR PRICE: We saw additional Russian forces take up readiness. That is not consistent with a country that purports to be interested in diplomacy.

QUESTION: No, but that is not diplomacy per se. That was an internal government meeting. Whether they – it was staged or what —

MR PRICE: That was kabuki theater, I think we can agree.

QUESTION: Well, fine, yeah, but I want to know if you’re talking about the meeting in Geneva between the Secretary and Foreign Minister Lavrov.

MR PRICE: I was referring to the incident of kabuki theater that I just mentioned to you.

QUESTION: You’re referring specifically – okay, because I just want to make sure that you don’t think – you’re not now in a position where you think that the meeting in Geneva that did happen was a waste of time and simply an entertainment.

MR PRICE: Look, I wouldn’t want to characterize —

QUESTION: Or the Security Council meetings are a waste of time because – I just want to make sure that you’re not talking about those.

MR PRICE: Well, I – so the UN Security Council meeting most certainly was not a waste of time because the Russian Federation and the entire world heard from a number of countries the broad and strong consensus that this should be resolved diplomatically and that state sovereignty should be an inviolable principle. That certainly was not pointless.

Yes.

QUESTION: (Off-mike.)

MR PRICE: Sure.

QUESTION: Because before the Security Council meeting, U.S. officials said that they believed Russia could be using it as a pretext for this invasion. And you said earlier that this is and has been in some ways kabuki theater all along. So are you – to Matt’s point, are you making the assessment that the —

MR PRICE: The security – the Russian Security Council meeting you’re referring to?

QUESTION: No, sorry, the one last Thursday, before there was a briefing where U.S. officials said they believed given the document that the Russian mission circulated that they were going to use the meeting as a pretext. So do you assess now that all of these diplomatic engagements were part of a charade to give Russia cover, to show that they had been engaging in good faith diplomacy in their mind?

MR PRICE: I wouldn’t want to make a sweeping categorical judgment like that. What I will say is that, if you take a step back, we have not seen any indication that Russia’s stated commitment to the diplomatic path had – bore any resemblance to its actions or that its actions reflected any commitment to – stated commitment to the diplomatic path. That is not to say that there is not value in these sessions, and I think the UN Security Council session that you all saw last Thursday was extraordinarily valuable. It was valuable for – even for the Russian Federation, and if any of those messages got to the Russian people, they would have heard a strong message of resolve and consensus and unanimity from the rest of the world that the steps that Putin was taking, the plans that he may well still have in mind, that is not something that the rest of the world is prepared to countenance.

QUESTION: But the meetings in Geneva, the non-papers back and forth, that – you don’t think that that all was a charade by the Russian Government?

MR PRICE: I am not prepared to use such wholesale language. Now, have we been able to deter and to prevent the worst-case scenario? That’s still an unresolved question. What is not unresolved is that we have seen continued signs that the Russian Federation is moving forward with the plans that we have been warning about for weeks.

QUESTION: Can I have another follow-up?

QUESTION: Can I just point out that some people do find value in kabuki theater, especially the Japanese, who invented it?

MR PRICE: That’s – no —

QUESTION: They pay to go see it, so —

MR PRICE: No offense intended.

Yes.

QUESTION: Can I just – another follow-up?

MR PRICE: Yeah, yeah.

QUESTION: Yesterday Foreign Minister Kuleba said that their Plan A, obviously, is to use diplomacy to deter Russia. Plan B is to defend every inch of Ukrainian territory. You have previously praised their restraint. Do you agree with their Plan B? Do you think they have a right to self-defense? And if Russia moves past the current areas that the separatists control in the Donbas, do the Ukrainians have a right to respond?

MR PRICE: Of course, the Ukrainians have a right to self-defense.

Yes.

QUESTION: So I find there have been a lot of mixed signals coming from the PRC in terms of its stance on the Ukraine situation. At times they’ve talked about the importance of state sovereignty; other times they’ve railed against NATO expansion. Have you – has the State Department been in communication with PRC interlocutors seeking clarity on their position? And have you laid out any ways in which these ongoing signals might undercut U.S.-China ties?

And on a related note, you’ve kind of hinted before that if the PRC were to seek to undermine the impact of U.S. sanctions on Russia, then the U.S. would have countermeasures. Have those discussions continued with PRC interlocutors?

MR PRICE: Well, as you know, Secretary Blinken had an opportunity to speak to his counterpart, Foreign Minister Wang, just the other night. And one of the two primary topics they discussed was Russia’s – the crisis that Russia has needlessly precipitated with Ukraine and with the rest of the world. Secretary Blinken – and we issued a readout; the PRC also issued their own readout – but you saw in our readout that the Secretary made very clear where we stand in terms of our unwavering support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity and its sovereignty. And I think especially that last point, sovereignty, should be an element that the PRC understands quite well. We often in statecraft hear the PRC cite this principle of sovereignty, which in any number of instances they have claimed should be inviolable, should be sacrosanct, should be one of the foundational rules that countries abide by and respect.

So you’ll have to ask the PRC how they marry that longstanding position with anything less than an effort to use the considerable influence and sway they have with the Russian Federation to urge Vladimir Putin to back down, to de-escalate. Whether they are doing that, you’ll have to ask them. But we did see in the readout that our PRC counterparts are also calling for the situation to be resolved diplomatically and to be resolved peacefully. Now, whether Putin heeds that call, I think that is not something we yet know.

QUESTION: And what about relaying the potential impact on U.S.-China relations?

MR PRICE: Look, in terms of our bilateral relationship with —

QUESTION: In terms of China’s support for Russia in its railing against NATO expansion and the potential tacit endorsement that that provides – what’s the impact of that on U.S.-China relations?

MR PRICE: Well, we believe – and we’ve made this point not only about the PRC, but every responsible country in the world has, in our estimation, an obligation to use any influence it has with the Russian Federation to urge, to incentivize, to advocate for Vladimir Putin to back down, for the Russian Federation to de-escalate. Again, you will have to ask the PRC whether they have used their own considerable influence with the Russian Federation to that end. Of course, we’ve all read the 5,000-word joint communiqué, and we can glean our own conclusions from that.

I think what gives us concern is that – from that manifesto and from what we’ve seen not only in recent days, weeks, and months, but in recent years – is this growing partnership between Russia and the PRC. And I say it’s concerning because we talk about a rules-based international order, a rules-based international order that has been at the crux of seven-plus decades of unprecedented levels of stability, of security, of prosperity the world over, whether that’s in Europe or the Indo-Pacific and places in between.

It is true, I think, we think, that Russia and the PRC also want a world order. This is a vision that they appear to be developing together if you read that communiqué. But this is an order that is and would be profoundly illiberal, an order that stands in contrast to the system that countries around the world – including, by the way, Russia and in some ways the PRC – have built over the last seven decades. It is an order that is in many ways destructive rather than additive.

So that is as we see this relationship develop, and we’ve seen something that gives us great concern. And of course, in recent days we’ve seen Russia reach out to its autocratic counterparts in other corners of the globe. This gets back to one of the core points that the President has been making since before he assumed high office, and that is, increasingly, we are seeing the world divided between democracy and autocracy. It is and has been a charge of this President and this administration’s foreign policy to act to unite our democratic colleagues around the world, to act in unison, to galvanize collective action. And I think whether the challenge has been what Russia is doing, whether the challenge has been what the PRC is doing, what we are seeing from state and non-state actors around the world, you’ve seen us succeed in that.

But it will continue to be an animating principle as we continue to see the forces of autocracy, the forces of authoritarianism, the forces of illiberalism continue to work together and attempt to combine forces. But the other point, even as they try to do that, we are confident. We are confident in our own abilities. We are confident in our abilities as an international community, and whether that’s the West, whether that’s a community of democracies, whether it is our system of alliances and partnerships that span the globe.

And we’re confident for a number of reasons. If you look at it quantitatively, we have 50 percent-plus of global GDP. We have a large share of the world’s population. China and Russia, in terms of their GDP are, what, 20 percent of global GDP? We have innovation. We have entrepreneurship. We have a shared set of values that we really think are a core instrument of national power. And we know that when we put all of this together, especially when we act with our allies and our partners – as we’ve done in the face of the challenge that Russia has posed, in the face of the challenge to the rules-based international system that the PRC has posed – or even when you talk about the threats and challenges that we face that are not state actors – climate change, COVID, economic recovery – we know that acting together, we are situated to take on any threat, to seize any opportunity.

And that’s really been the driving force of our foreign policy. It’s why Secretary Blinken spent so much time of his first year in office repairing, revitalizing, in some ways reimagining the system of alliances and partnerships. And you’re seeing the dividends of that now play out, even in recent hours.

QUESTION: Well, first of all, can you guess how long that answer was, how many minutes that was?

MR PRICE: (Laughter.) I’m sure you will tell me.

QUESTION: I’ll pull it up – well, I can’t because my Otter seems to have, like, frozen here. But if —

MR PRICE: Yeah. I haven’t paid for the premium version.

QUESTION: But if you’re – yeah – but if you’re boasting about reinventing it and you’re seeing that – the fruits of all that labor now, you’re talking about the united reaction against —

MR PRICE: United – the united response of the international community.

QUESTION: To Russia?

MR PRICE: Yeah.

QUESTION: Okay. Can I – purely – it’s unrelated to Ukraine, but it is China. And that is something that I know Nike is interested in and has been asking about before. But there is barely an anniversary, a diplomatic – an anniversary in diplomatic history that goes by without the U.S. – the State Department at least, if not the White House – making some kind of comment about it. And in that light, regardless of how tense or strained relations are now with China, why is it that there hasn’t been any mention of Nixon’s – former President Nixon’s – the 50th anniversary of former President Nixon’s visit to China, which was a pretty groundbreaking event when it happened, paved the way for recognition or U.S. recognition of the PRC and opening of diplomatic relations.

And it seems to me that it would make sense for there to be some kind of mention of this, or are you just, like, embarrassed by it now and think that it should never have happened?

MR PRICE: I don’t think – certainly not the latter. I – Matt, there are some anniversaries that we commemorate there. There are other anniversaries that we don’t. I’m not aware of any plans at the moment for a statement, but —

QUESTION: Yeah, but (inaudible) statements about, like, the 17th anniversary of U.S.-Iceland relations or something – not to demean Iceland – but I mean, these kinds of things get attention. And this one, which was, a pretty big deal – a BFD, as the President might say – at the time and since, just seems to be being ignored.

MR PRICE: I don’t know that we’re ignoring it. I’m not sure that I would equate not putting out a formal statement with ignoring it.

Nike.

QUESTION: Thank you, Matt, for asking (inaudible). But my question is on Pakistan. Can I ask about Pakistan Prime Minister Khan’s visit to Russia? Does the State Department have a – an assessment of his visit at this timing?

MR PRICE: Well, we’re certainly aware of the trip, and the points I made earlier about the PRC in some ways apply here. We believe it’s the responsibility of every responsible country around the world to voice concern, to voice objection to what Putin appears to have in mind for Ukraine. We’ve communicated to Pakistan our position regarding Russia’s further renewed invasion of Ukraine, and we have briefed them on our efforts to pursue diplomacy over war. We have a longstanding partnership and cooperation with Pakistan. We view our partnership with a prosperous, with a democratic Pakistan as critical to U.S. interests. And we certainly hope, when it comes to those shared interests – the aversion of a costly conflict, the aversion of a destabilizing conflict, that every country around the world would make that point clearly in unambiguous language in their engagements with the Russian Federation.

Andrea.

QUESTION: On the —

QUESTION: Can I – sorry, can I just follow up on Khan’s visit? On the timing of his visit, is it the U.S. read that he’s indirectly endorsing Putin?

MR PRICE: You would have to ask the Pakistani Government what the intent is.

QUESTION: But I’m asking your read.

MR PRICE: You would have to ask the Pakistani Government. I’m just not in a position to offer an assessment on the timing of foreign counterparts’ travel to another country.

Yes, Andrea.

QUESTION: Do you have a different assessment of Vladimir Putin than the one that this government had – that this President had – after Geneva, or was the previous assessment wrong?

MR PRICE: The previous assessment and the assessment now is that we would prefer a relationship with Russia that is stable and predictable. But at every turn before Geneva or just about every turn before Geneva and at turns since Geneva, the Russian Federation has indicated that they have apparently little interest in that type of relationship. So we’ve always said that – and we said this before Geneva when we responded decisively in response to interference in our elections, in response to the Russian Federation’s use of weapons of mass destruction against dissidents on foreign soil, for SolarWinds – that we would respond decisively, strongly in response to these types of activities. We have. The same is true if Russia continues its invasion of Ukraine. Same principle applies.

QUESTION: A separate question on a different subject, if I could ask a quick question about Iran?

MR PRICE: Okay. Any final questions on Russia/Ukraine before we move on?

QUESTION: Yes. Yes.

MR PRICE: Okay, please. Please.

QUESTION: On sanctions.

MR PRICE: Yes.

QUESTION: Today the Russian ambassador to Washington said that he doesn’t remember a single day that – when Russia lived without restrictions from the Western world. Putin proved he’s immune to sanctions. He has $600 billion in federal reserves. He has been in the driving seat making decisions to which the West is responding now and was responding since 2008. Are you thinking of a strategical approach to deal with this? You just said that they are trying to change the world order.

MR PRICE: So to the statement from the Russian Federation that they have been under sanctions since 2014, that is of course accurate. The sanctions that we have put in place and that we will continue to put in place are qualitatively different from any measures that the United States or any other country has imposed on the Russian Federation, including in 2014. So if they are comparing what they’ve been under now to what they will be under in – going forward if this invasion moves forward, that would be a profound miscalculation on their part.

When you talk about and think about the sanctions that we’ve already put in place, Nord Stream 2 is off the table. The Germans have taken decisive action. We have taken decisive action. That’s an $11 billion project that is now a piece of steel at the bottom of the ocean. We have, in lockstep with our allies, put in place blocking sanctions against the fifth-largest Russian financial institution. That’s $50 billion in assets. We’ve put in place blocking sanctions against another bank that funds the Ministry of Defense with some $35 billion in assets. In other words, these institutions can no longer make any transactions with the United States or with Europe, given Europe’s – the EU’s own corresponding actions in this regard.

Here’s the other point: With the authorities we have, with the intent we have, no Russian financial institution is safe if the invasion proceeds. As you heard from Daleep Singh yesterday, we are ready at the press of a button to take action against the two largest financial institutions in Russia. Together, these are institutions that hold three-quarters of a trillion dollars in assets, $750 billion in assets, half of the total Russian banking system. There are other measures and moves we have in store and that are ready if Russia continues with this invasion, including export controls, targeted sanctions against oligarchs and elites, and other measures.

So the Russians can depict these moves however they would like. I think it is noteworthy what we heard from our Ukrainian partners yesterday. You heard from Foreign Minister Kuleba as he was standing right next to Secretary Blinken here at the department. He said that, quote, “[W]e do appreciate…the sanctions which were announced today. They target Russia. They’re very specific. They are painful.”

QUESTION: (Off-mike.)

MR PRICE: Please. Please, go ahead. Yeah, Joel.

QUESTION: Thanks, Ned. I arrived with a couple questions of my own and have a couple follow-ups for this interesting conversation, from what you told my colleagues. First, do you think that China, given their desire for the world order that you just described, regards Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a step towards bringing that about?

MR PRICE: It is certainly not a step in the direction of the principle that the PRC claims to prize, and that is state sovereignty. You – I think everyone in this room is familiar with the position the PRC has taken in response to Russia’s aggression in Ukraine since 2014. I wouldn’t want to characterize that, but it suggests a level of deep unease.

So again, I would refer you to the PRC for any comment they might have on what Putin has in store, but if we are to judge the PRC based on what they have said consistently on the world stage in any number of fora, a direct assault on the sovereignty, on the territorial integrity of another state, that would not be consistent with what we’ve heard.

QUESTION: Yeah, I was just trying to clarify, because I thought I heard you say they’re – they’ve combined forces somehow.

MR PRICE: It was a reference to the burgeoning partnership that we’ve seen between these two countries over the course of many years now.

QUESTION: Okay. On Ukraine’s Plan B, fighting for every inch, Senator Risch, who is of course ranking on Foreign Relations and on Intelligence, or a senior member of the Intelligence Committee, has said that Russia could sweep across Ukraine pretty quickly, their first day would be their best day, they’d immediately face resistance movements. So I wonder, would the United States as a member of NATO either encourage or object to other NATO members offering this Ukrainian resistance cross-border safe haven?

MR PRICE: Countries are going to make their own sovereign decisions. We have in recent weeks, as you know, worked with a number of our NATO Allies to authorize them to provide U.S.-origin equipment to our Ukrainian partners – this is defensive security equipment – with an understanding that our Ukrainian partners need supplies, need materiel to defend themselves. The United States has provided them with this. We have – a number of our NATO Allies have done the same.

But when it comes to the decision that NATO Allies or other countries in Europe might make along those lines, I’d need to refer you there.

QUESTION: And I guess I wonder, do you see any lessons from Afghanistan for the kind of risk that we’re of course – when the Taliban could retire across the border to a place where they couldn’t be attacked, then that was difficult for a modern military to defeat.

MR PRICE: I – look, I would hesitate to make battlefield comparisons between two very different countries.

QUESTION: Finally, what I hope are truly a couple of quick ones. Those Nord Stream 2 sanctions, are those permanent or do you think that, like, the permanent punishment for this, that that’s gone, or do you regard that as something that could be lifted again later in exchange for de-escalation? And can we also get an answer to Foreign Minister Kuleba’s request for a Lend-Lease program? Do you expect that to proceed?

MR PRICE: Look, the fact is that sanctions are a means to an end. There is no sanction in any responsible sanctions program around the world that is permanent, and that is precisely because we don’t sanction countries just with the goal of enacting sanctions. This is not a policy to be purely punitive; this is a policy to change behavior. In this case, this is a policy to deter a further Russian invasion of Ukraine, to deter a war – a bloody, costly, devastating war that would take place on European soil and that would constitute the greatest threat to peace and security since the conclusion of World War II, certainly since the end of the Cold War.

QUESTION: Wait, so now the imposition of sanctions is a deterrent? I thought we just spent the last, like, couple months – you and the administration spent, like, the last couple months arguing that the threat of sanctions was the deterrent, and that if you imposed – that if you actually imposed them, then you would lose that deterrent.

MR PRICE: Matt, you’ve heard us say —

QUESTION: But you can’t have it both ways.

MR PRICE: We’re not having it both ways, Matt. You have heard us say very clearly, if Russia’s invasion escalates, if Russia’s actions escalate, so too will our response. We are prepared to enact an escalating series of measures against the Russian Federation if – unless – until and unless the Russian Federation changes course.

Said.

QUESTION: No Lend-Lease program?

QUESTION: Can I —

MR PRICE: So look, I don’t have any response to that, but – specific response to that, but I will make the point that this has not been Lend-Lease; this has a been a program of provision. We have provided our Ukrainian partners with, over the course of the last year, $650 million worth of defensive security assistance. We’re in a constant conversation and dialogue with our Ukrainian partners about their defensive security needs, and that will continue. As I mentioned before, if the Russian invasion continues, we will not only continue with that provision of security assistance, but we’ll double down on it.

Said.

QUESTION: Could I change topics? Just a very quick one on the Palestinian —

MR PRICE: Anything left on Russia-Ukraine?

QUESTION: I have on Ukraine.

QUESTION: Ukraine, Ukraine.

MR PRICE: In the very back, please.

QUESTION: Yes, sir. So – but you – we listened to the Russians also, and they present also, as they say, their legit security grievances. And it seems the West in a way or another did not reach any common – to which extent the U.S. and NATO now is really going into this offer of diplomacy? Where is the West going to give an in into the security demands from Putin?

MR PRICE: So this is something we’ve spoken to at great length. It’s actually something that we put in writing at some length. Subscribers of El País can see it with their own eyes. But we’ve been quite clear that there are some, quote/unquote, “demands” that the Russian Federation has put forward that are non-starters for us. The very principles that are at stake in terms of the rules-based international order, those are not negotiable. The idea that any other country can dictate the policy choices, whether foreign policy or domestic policy, of any other country – that is not something we’re going to negotiate. International borders, internationally recognized borders, sovereignty, the inviolability of borders – that is not something that is up for negotiation.

But what we – there are some areas that would improve our security, our own security environment, the security environment of the transatlantic community, and could address some of the stated security concerns of the Russian Federation. And we’ve delineated a series of those: discussions regarding the placement of offensive missiles in Europe; broader arms control protocols; protocols regarding stability and transparency; confidence-building measures. There are a number of areas that we think have the potential to be fruitful if we find a negotiating counterpart in the Russian Federation that operates in good faith. We have not found that yet, and I think at this stage those sort of broader areas may not take precedence to the first priority that we have, and that’s averting a bloody, costly, devastating war in Ukraine.

So I think our diplomacy going forward, at least for the foreseeable future, if, again, we find a counterpart in Moscow that is willing to sit down in good faith to discuss these issues in good faith, we are going to be very focused on saving lives, on preventing a war, on seeing to it that the plans Putin has set in motion over the course of many months now do not go forward.

Conor.

QUESTION: Two very quick ones on Trevor Reed and Paul Whelan. Do you have any indication that their cases are being treated separately from all this? Any concerns that the crisis would affect their detentions?

MR PRICE: We always treat the cases of U.S. hostages separate and apart from geopolitical issues and geopolitical dynamics. It remains an absolute priority for us to see the release of Paul Whelan and Trevor Reed, both of whom have been held unjustly, traveled to Russia as tourists, have been imprisoned on false charges that entire time. So it’s a priority of ours.

QUESTION: You do, but do you have any concern that the Russian Government would not?

MR PRICE: Again, human beings should not be held as pawns in terms of state-to-state relations. It is our priority to see them released, to do everything we can to achieve their release as quickly as we can.

QUESTION: And then secondly, do you have any new estimate of the number of Americans that would be in Ukraine at this moment in time?

MR PRICE: So as we’ve told you, late last year, October of last year, it was our assessment at the time that there were some 6,600 Americans who were resident in Ukraine. Now, that timeframe is important because the very month – October 2021 – that this assessment was last updated was the very month that we started urging Americans not to travel to Ukraine. In more recent weeks, as you know, we have been recommending and, even more recently, urging Americans to leave Ukraine.

So I think there is every expectation that the number of Americans who are resident in Ukraine late last year, October of last year, is far lower now than it was then. I can tell you procedurally we have been in repeated contact with Americans who remain in Ukraine. We have asked them to provide us with their contact information so that we can continue to be in communication with them to urge them to leave the country, to avail themselves of commercial and private options that continue to be available, and to provide any form of support that they may need in doing so, and that includes a repatriation loan if they’re not able to afford the return travel on their own.

When – in addition, we have provided specific guidance on overland crossings that Americans can take, providing specific recommendations about border crossings. We have been engaged in diplomacy with our Polish allies to see to it that Americans need not have any sort of advanced authorization to travel across the border. We’ve even established a welcome center across the Polish border to assist Americans should they need any assistance, whether it’s a passport application, whether it’s any form – other form of consular assistance.

Yes.

QUESTION: You just used the word “hostage” to describe Trevor Reed and Paul Whelan.

MR PRICE: They’re Americans who are unjustly detained.

QUESTION: So do you regard them as hostages? I haven’t heard that formulation before, but maybe I missed it.

MR PRICE: They are – they are Americans who are held unjustly against their will.

QUESTION: I know, but do you regard them as hostages?

MR PRICE: I – we’ll get back to you if there’s a – if – on that. i

Yes.

QUESTION: (Inaudible) about Latin America, the fact that Putin is looking for new partners in Latin America – for example, Argentina, Brazil. What’s the position of the State Department? And do you think this is a way to increase the pressure on the United States, talking about the close relationship of United States with Latin America?

MR PRICE: Well, it goes back to what we were discussing before, and this is the fact that what we are seeing is autocracies around the world band together, and we’ve seen in some ways Russia at the vanguard of this activity. When it comes to their motives or intentions, that’s not something I would want to speak to from here. I would refer you to the – to Moscow to speak to their own foreign policy decisions. But we have certainly seen Moscow reach out to some of the most repressive, autocratic, undemocratic governments in this hemisphere. That includes Nicaragua. That includes Cuba. That includes Venezuela.

Yes, Said.

QUESTION: Thank you. I want to move to the Palestinian issue and I have a quick one on Iran. On the Palestinian issue —

QUESTION: (Off-mike.)

QUESTION: Yeah, okay. Yeah. On the Palestinian issue, I know I have asked in this room many times before on your position regarding the practice of administrative detentions by Israel, to which all Palestinians at one time or another probably experience. There is one particular case, a 14-year-old boy who has been falsely accused. One Israeli judge after Israeli judge threw it out of court, but the authorities keep him in prison. They keep renewing this. He has a neuromuscular disease. He might die in prison. Will the United States call on Israel to quit this practice, especially against children who have not – who have been found innocent by their own judicial system?

MR PRICE: Said, you’ve heard this from us before, but we urge —

QUESTION: And the boy’s name, by the way, is just, for the record, Amal Nakhleh.

MR PRICE: We urge the full respect for human rights in Israel and the West Bank and Gaza. As we’ve said many times, Palestinians and Israelis alike equally deserve to live safely and securely, to enjoy equal measures of freedom, of security, of prosperity.

QUESTION: With all due respect, the Palestinians do not arrest Israelis and put them under administrative detention.

MR PRICE: Said, we – and again, you have heard this from us before, but we continue to elevate the role of human rights in our foreign relations and to encourage, to your question, legal reforms that advance respect for human rights of all individuals.

QUESTION: My second question also pertains to the holding of dead Palestinians, killed Palestinians, those who have been killed by the Israeli soldiers for years on end. Is that the – is that a form of collective punishment? Does the – does this administration view this as a collective punishment?

MR PRICE: We have stressed to Israel both publicly as well as privately our strong hope that any measures that Israel takes would be designed to avoid further escalating tensions and to take into consideration the impact of any such measures on the Palestinian people.

QUESTION: And lastly, on Iran, should we expect some sort of a deal or returning to a deal over the next few days, as was suggested?

MR PRICE: Well, you’ve heard this from my colleagues, but there has been significant progress, and we are close to a possible deal, but at the same time, a number of very difficult issues remain unresolved. What we know is that there is very little time remaining to reach a deal, to resolve these remaining issues given the pace of Iran’s nuclear advances. You’ve heard us say this before, but it remains true that even as we are narrowing the set of issues we’re discussing, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.

If Iran shows seriousness, if it demonstrates serious of purpose in Vienna, we believe that we can and should reach an understanding on a potential mutual return to compliance in short order, potentially within days. But anything much beyond that, if this were to drag on any longer than that, would put the possibility of return to the deal at grave and profound risk.

Andrea.

QUESTION: (Inaudible) issues, whether they involve equipment, centrifuges, compliance, verification? Broad categories, Ned.

MR PRICE: I really can’t, and that is primarily because we are at this decisive stage where it is incumbent on the Iranians and all parties to do everything we can to narrow those differences. We’re going to be a little bit more circumspect at this especially sensitive period, but again, if the Iranians demonstrate seriousness of purpose, we believe that we can achieve an understanding in relatively short order.

QUESTION: (Inaudible) anything more on travel?

MR PRICE: On travel?

QUESTION: By the Secretary.

MR PRICE: Oh, by the Secretary. We – look, we do not have any travel to announce or to preview at this time. The Secretary has been working the phones. He has been on with Josep Borrell of the EU today. He spoke to his British counterpart, Elizabeth Truss, earlier today as well. And I expect you will see him continue to engage with his counterparts around the world.

Yes.

QUESTION: On Yemen, we saw the designations today, and in the statement you said they are intensifying the humanitarian crisis. When you removed them last year from the terrorist organization list, you said you did that for humanitarian purposes. Is the State Department – my first question: Is the State Department objecting designating them as a terrorist organization?

MR PRICE: So as you know, there’s a review underway regarding that very question, so I’m not in a position to speak to it in any great detail. What I can say is that we have a number of tools at our disposal, including the tools we use today in mounting sanctions and designations against these Houthi-affiliated individuals and entities, that can hold the Houthis accountable for their reprehensible behavior. We are committed to doing so; we will continue to do so. We will use every appropriate tool to hold accountable those Houthi leaders who are responsible for the terrorist attacks for – against our partners in the region, for the violence in Yemen itself, for the humanitarian emergency, which by many estimations is now the world’s worst humanitarian catastrophe with some 16 million people who are suffering from food insecurity and malnutrition.

So we are committed to doing everything we can to bring this conflict to an end, knowing that only through a diplomatic resolution will we be able to, on a sustainable basis, calm the violence, ease the humanitarian suffering of the Yemeni people, and mitigate the threat that the United States and our partners face from the Houthis, including in the context of these attacks.

QUESTION: On Iran, do we expect anything regarding the detainees ahead of the deal?

MR PRICE: Again, this is an issue that is of the utmost importance to the United States. At every single opportunity, we make the release of Americans, of other third-country nationals, a priority of ours. We have been clear that the nuclear negotiations in Vienna and our efforts to see our unjustly detained citizens released, these operate on separate tracks precisely because a potential return to the JCPOA has always, at best, been an uncertain proposition, and we want the release of our citizens to be a certain proposition.

So we have not explicitly tied our Americans – tied these individuals, these detainees to progress in the nuclear talks. But as Rob Malley has made clear, it is – certainly it colors our engagement in Vienna and elsewhere knowing that this is a government that is unjustly detaining Americans and other third-country nationals.

So in every other context we’re doing this, but certainly in the case of Iran we’re making every effort to see our Americans, to see other third-country nationals released just as quickly as possible.

QUESTION: Back on Yemen and the Houthis.

MR PRICE: Mm-hmm.

QUESTION: And I realize that a lot of people probably think this is just a semantic thing, so I’ll keep it short, but the – these designations were made under an executive order that is a counterterrorism executive order. And you – in the Secretary’s statement and in the Treasury’s statement, it refers to the Houthis committing terrorist acts, but it doesn’t identify them as terrorists. And the EO – they’re being used – they’re being designated under a counterterrorism EO simply because of their affiliation with the IRGC Qods Force, which is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization.

So my question is: Do you believe that the Houthis as a group are terrorists? You say that – you’ve designated them under a counterterrorism executive order. You accused them of staging, launching terrorist attacks. But you won’t call them terrorists. Why not?

MR PRICE: Matt, so this is a question that’s based on semantics, but we’ve been very clear that —

QUESTION: Well, and —

MR PRICE: — that the Houthis have launched reprehensible terrorist attacks —

QUESTION: Yes.

MR PRICE: — against our partners in the region. These may be attacks that are targeting our partners, but these types of operations have the potential not only to harm citizens of Saudi Arabia, citizens of the United Arab Emirates, but Americans —

QUESTION: Yes. Yes.

MR PRICE: — who may be in the region as well. So we have been very clear that these are terrorist attacks.

QUESTION: Yeah, but you’re not saying that the Houthis themselves are terrorists, and I’m just wondering why. And yes, it’s a semantic argument, but I’m just looking at a statement that came out from Senator Murphy and a bunch of his colleagues urging you not to reinstate the Foreign Terrorist Organization designation against the Houthis. So – because it would cause grave damage and economic – humanitarian – even worse humanitarian disaster. But yet, today you have designated these individuals and entities under a counterterrorism executive order and accused them of committing terrorist attacks. So what’s the problem? Why can’t you identify the Houthis as terrorists?

MR PRICE: It is completely consistent that a certain label and a certain authority – in this case, the FTO – not be applied to a group that can commit terrorist attacks. There are any number of examples of groups that aren’t FTOs that you know well that have committed, over the course of years, consistent terrorist attacks. This is a question of semantics. This is a question of legal authorities.

QUESTION: So what – well, it’s a question of political will, right? Or —

MR PRICE: It is a question of us demonstrating that we have a number of tools and a number of authorities to hold Houthi leaders and others affiliated with this movement accountable for their reprehensible actions —

QUESTION: Okay.

MR PRICE: — including the terrorist attacks that they’ve undertaken in recent days against our partners in the region.

QUESTION: Okay. Can you give me an example of a group that has been committing terrorist attacks for decades that has not been labeled an FTO?

MR PRICE: Matt, I think there are a number of examples. You could look at the Taliban as a group that is not an FTO that I think you would probably agree has committed terrorist attacks.

Thank you all very much.

MR PRICE: Good afternoon. Two items at the top, and then we’ll proceed.

Over the past weekend and even today, President Putin has continued to escalate his attack – hitting hospitals, schools and residential buildings, pummeling infrastructure, and killing civilians, all while Ukrainian forces bravely continue to repel this siege.

It becomes more evident every day that President Putin has gravely miscalculated. Now, three weeks into his unprovoked war against Ukraine, the Kremlin’s forces remain stalled in many areas and convoys have been unable to make significant progress. It is also clear that many brave people of conscience in Russia oppose the Kremlin’s unjustified war despite the unprecedented crackdown on dissenting voices.

Ukraine’s stiff resistance has slowed Putin’s assault, and Ukraine’s continued defense has stymied the Russian Federation’s plan for an imperial-style land grab.

This is – there is a clear off-ramp for this conflict: President Putin must stop the violence, de-escalate, and choose the path of diplomacy.

I also want to take a moment to reiterate our strong recommendation to U.S. citizens living in or traveling in Russia: you should depart immediately. This has been our recommendation for 10 days now, but I would note that our Travel Advisory has been at Level 4 – Do Not Travel – since August of 2020.

We have consistently messaged for weeks to U.S. citizens in Russia about the financial issues they may face, the danger in participating in protests, and the diminishing travel options, including flight options to depart. Most recently, we sent an alert about how to find our advice and recommendations given that Russia is drastically limiting the information space. Our embassy in Moscow has a limited ability to assist U.S. citizens, because of the Russian Government actions to restrict our staffing there. Since August of 2021, we have been able to provide only emergency services to U.S. citizens.

For all of these reasons, and more, we urge U.S. citizens to depart Russia now.

Next, in celebration of International Women’s Day, the U.S. Department of State was proud to announce the awardees of the 2022 International Women of Courage Awards. We were honored that First Lady Jill Biden and Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield attended the ceremony and provided remarks in honor of the inspirational achievements of the 2022 International Women of Courage awardees. From promoting environmental protection in Bangladesh to combatting corruption and organized crime in Brazil, to advocating for democracy and human rights in Burma and beyond, the 2022 International Women of Courage are an exemplary group of women. Their strength is endless, their courage unyielding, and their leadership inspires all of us.

The awardees will now embark on an International Visitor Leadership Program virtual exchange to meet and engage with American counterparts in civil society, academia, government, and the private sector in cities across the United States. Over the past 16 years, the United States has proudly bestowed the IWOC award on more than 170 courageous women from over 80 countries around the world. These women have shown exceptional courage in advocating for peace, for justice, human rights; promoting the empowerment of women and girls in all of their diversity, and making substantive positive change in their communities, sometimes at great personal risk.

We know countries that empower women and girls to be meaningful participants in social, political, and economic sectors of life – they are more just, they are more peaceful, they are more prosperous. It continues to be a great privilege for the United States to stand with the IWOC awardees and highlight the contributions of women from around the world. We remain deeply committed to advancing gender equity and equality at home and around the world as a central foreign policy and national security priority. For more information and updates on the 2022 Women of Courage, we encourage you to follow the hashtag #WomenOfCourage and #IWOC2022 on social media.

QUESTON: (Sneeze)

Bless you, and I will take your questions.

QUESTION: Thanks.

MR PRICE: Yes.

QUESTION: Just logistically, you said they were going to embark on a virtual tour?

MR PRICE: That’s right.

QUESTION: Is there going to be an actual physical tour as well?

MR PRICE: Knock on wood, COVID conditions permitting.

QUESTION: So, it’s a COVID thing?

MR PRICE: That’s correct.

QUESTION: Okay, on Ukraine.

MR PRICE: Yes.

QUESTION: Yesterday, administration officials were expressing concern that – about a Russian request to China for military assistance in their Ukraine invasion. I know that Jake Sullivan met with Yang Jiechi earlier in Rome, and the White House will have more to say about this later. But I’m wondering if in the meantime you have gotten any indication that this has gone – that this request that you say has been made has been met with any kind of a response, either positive or negative, by the Chinese.

MR PRICE: Well, Matt, to your question, we haven’t spoken to this, and not going to comment specifically on these reports. What I can say broadly, however – and you alluded to this – is the fact that our National Security Advisor, who is accompanied by our assistant secretary for the region, Dan Kritenbrink, is in Rome today, where they met with Yang Jiechi and his delegation from the PRC. The National Security Advisor and our delegation raised directly and very clearly our concerns about the PRC’s support to Russia in the wake of the invasion, and the implications that any such support would have for the PRC’s relationship not only with us, but for its relationships around the world. That includes our allies and partners in Europe and in the Indo-Pacific. Beyond that, I’m just not in a position to get into the details. But the purpose of this meeting – and you will hear more from the White House later today, I expect – was to convey very clearly our concerns and to discuss the implications.

QUESTION: Okay. But you said that you raised – I’ll go back and look here, but you said that – raised your concerns about Chinese support for, so does that mean that you think that they already are supporting?

MR PRICE: I am not confirming anything from here. What I will say is that we are watching very closely the extent to which the PRC, or any other country for that matter, provides any form of support – whether that’s material support – whether that’s economic support, whether that’s financial support, to Russia. Any such support from anywhere in the world would be of great concern to us. It would be of, of course, the greatest concern if a country like the PRC were to be doing that – a country that, by the way, has tremendous leverage with Russia, has a relationship with Russia that is distinct from the relationship that we or just about any other country on the planet has with Russia – and with that in mind, could do more than probably many other countries to bring an end to this senseless violence, to this brutality, to Putin’s premeditated war of choice.

We have communicated very clearly to Beijing that we won’t stand by if – we will not allow any country to compensate Russia for its losses.

QUESTION: Let me put it a different way. Are you disappointed in how the Chinese have responded to your outreach?

MR PRICE: I think, Matt, it is fair to say that it is incumbent upon every country around the world to speak out clearly, to allow there to be no ambiguity in terms of where they stand. We’ve heard statements from the PRC that have somewhat of an ambivalent message, calling for a diplomatic solution. I read a statement the other day from a PRC official, calling the situation complicated. There’s nothing complicated about this. This is naked aggression; this is a war of choice. This is a country, a – one individual at the top of that country violating, in a brazen manner, what have been the cardinal rules of the international order for the past 70 years, the basic tenet that big countries cannot bully small countries, that might no longer makes right, concepts that should have been banished to the last century, should not be around today.

So, we would like to see every country make very clear where it stands and to stand on the side of the rules-based order, the very rules-based order, Matt, that has benefited, of course, not only the United States and our allies and partners, but also countries like Russia and China.

One final point on this – and we’ve made this point before – countries like the PRC have over the years touted and brandished the concept of sovereignty, often pointing to sovereignty in any manner, in any matter of foreign policy and diplomacy. If the concept of sovereignty means anything in practice to a country like the PRC, we would expect countries like that to stand up, to speak out, to make clear that a blatant violation of state sovereignty, the likes of which we have not heretofore seen in this century, is unacceptable.

Humeyra.

QUESTION: So just to follow on that, follow up on that, Ned. We have reporting showing that U.S. sent diplomatic cable to allies in NATO and in Asia saying China had shown willingness to supply Russia with military and economic assistance. Can you say anything about the scope of this economic and military assistance?

MR PRICE: I can’t, and I would point you to that somewhat extended answer I just gave to Matt. The point is it is true: we have coordinated very closely with our allies and partners. We have shared concerns not only about, of course, Russia’s egregious behavior, but concerns beyond that. I’m just not in a position to speak to it in detail.

QUESTION: Right. So, what’s next then, because Jake Sullivan over the weekend said there would be consequences? Will you guys now convene and start working on a sanctions package for China as well?

MR PRICE: Well, again, we’re not going to preview where this might go. Obviously don’t want to entertain a hypothetical like that at this point, but I can point to what has happened today. And the National Security Advisor, our assistant secretary, our delegation, met with Yang Jiechi and his delegation to precisely make clear our concerns and to be very candid in terms of the implications.

Again, we are watching very closely to – the extent to which the PRC or any country in the world provides support – material, economic, financial, rhetorical, otherwise – to this war of choice that President Putin is waging against the Government of Ukraine, against the state of Ukraine, against the people of Ukraine. And we have been very clear, both privately with Beijing, publicly with Beijing, that there would be consequences for any such support.

QUESTION: Just one more thing. Just at the beginning of this, the Chinese were walking a more ambiguous line, perhaps. What is your assessment that – why they changed their mind and are now partnering up with Russia?

MR PRICE: I am not going to speak for the PRC. I will let them explain their actions. I will let them —

QUESTION: I am asking for a U.S. assessment of why Beijing has changed their mind. Surely, you have an assessment.

MR PRICE: I will let them explain their actions. I will let them explain their words. I think there is a lot for them to explain. Look, I think the broader point is that we have seen the relationship between the PRC and Russia grow closer. This is not a phenomenon that has taken place over recent days or even recent weeks. This is a relationship that has grown closer over the course of many years now. And I think we saw an encapsulation of that with the 5,000-word communique that the two countries put out now, a number of weeks ago.

Without trying to – without going too deep into the analysis of the relationship of – that two sovereign countries share, what I will say is that what does seem to unite them is a vision of the world that is in stark contrast to the vision that the United States and our allies and partners have not only built and promoted and defended, but the system that itself has advantaged countries like the PRC and Russia. This is a free and open rules-based order that has governed affairs between states for more than 70 years now. This is very clearly a case of two autocracies with a desire to see a world that is more closed, that is less open, that is less free, come together, in some ways joining forces, and we’re watching very closely to determine the form that any such cooperation may take.

Andrea.

QUESTION: Ned, it seems hardly a coincidence that this is a pivotal moment in terms of Russia and Russia’s finances. There is a lot of reporting that they could default by Wednesday if someone doesn’t bail them out. And now you have the National Security Advisor on a quick trip to Rome to talk to the Chinese in a matter of some urgency. So, would it be fair to conclude that it is vitally important to the sanctions that were imposed on the central bank, and on Russia in general by the U.S. that you get an answer in the next – within 24 hours, within 48 hours from China – that this is a key moment in terms of potential financial support for Russia?

MR PRICE: Andrea, I think it is – it is fair to conclude that the Russian economy is in dire straits. That has been the case ever since the series of sanctions and other economic measures were instituted in the – at the very outset of the invasion of Ukraine. We can point to any number of metrics. I did see an independent analysis that Russia’s on the brink of default. We know that its credit rating is now at junk status. We know that the Russian stock market will be closed at least through this week, now going on several weeks of closure, in an apparent effort to forestall capital flight that is bound to happen as soon as the Russian stock market reopens, whenever that is. The ruble is almost literally worthless. It is worth less than a penny at this point. You could go on and on and on.

Here’s the point. We’ve made very clear that any country that would seek to attempt to bail Russia out of this economic, financial morass will be met with consequences. We will ensure that no country is able to get away with such a thing.

But here’s the other point. No form of economic or financial support will be able to extricate Russia from the strategic morass that it has created for itself. Russia today, Russia going forward, it is a much weaker country. It is a country that is in a strategically unenviable position, because of the diplomatic isolation, the diplomatic rebuke; but, also, the economic costs and the export controls, the measures that we have put in place to see to it that Russia cannot import the inputs, key components it needs for its strategic ambitions in the world. That is not going to change. That will not change until and unless President Putin changes course and —

QUESTION: But the export controls are a long-term issue for Russia. The collapse of its currency, and lack of reserves to bail it out, is precipitous and —

MR PRICE: You have a series of short-term and long-term measures.

QUESTION: In the short term, what do you understand the financial relationship between Russia and China to be as of today?

MR PRICE: Look, I will let these two countries speak to their relationship. It’s not for me to characterize the economic relationship or the potential economic relationship. It is for me to characterize the consequences that would befall any country, whether the PRC or otherwise, that would seek to help Russia avoid the brunt of the measures that have been put in place by, really, the rest of the world, or certainly a large majority of the world.

And that’s the other important point. Russia and China, when you combine their GDPs, it’s something like 25 percent of global GDP. When you combine the GDP, the economic might, of the United States, the European Union, our allies in the Indo-Pacific, our other allies and partners that have joined us: well over 50 percent. So, there is not a country out there that would be able to fully extricate Moscow from this. The only thing that could relieve the pressure, that could extricate, in a meaningful way, Moscow from the morass it has created for itself, is for Putin to change course, to de-escalate and to end the violence.

QUESTION: And do you – is it your understanding that there was an answer on this subject today in Rome?

MR PRICE: As I was coming down here, the meeting had not concluded, or at least the last time I received an update the meeting had not concluded, so I will leave that to the White House to characterize.

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: Thank you. (Inaudible) Jahanzaib Ali from ARY News TV, Pakistan. Sir, it looks like that a few of the neighboring countries of Russia secretly supporting Russian aggression, like China with the India, Pakistan, Iran, and some other – and some others, rich Arab countries. So, are you engaging with these countries that – to change their stance on that?

MR PRICE: We are engaging with countries around the world, and we have done so from this building. I think you have probably noted that virtually every conversation the Secretary has, which you can glean from our readouts, he raises the issue of Russia and Ukraine. We are doing so intensively at our mission to the UN, and I think you saw the fruits of the efforts out of this building and the fruits of the efforts out of New York in the UN General Assembly vote the other day, where 141 countries came together, the majority of the world’s countries – the overwhelming majority of the world’s countries – to make clear that this sort of aggression would not stand, and that the vast majority of the world was on the side of the rules-based order that Putin is so blatantly violating, and standing very firmly against his actions. So, of course, we have had conversations with our partners in South Asia. We have had conversations with our partners in the Indo-Pacific, Middle East, Africa, around the world.

QUESTION: A few days back, India confirmed that it had accidentally fired a supersonic nuclear-capable missile into Pakistan because of a technical issue, while Pakistan warned New Delhi of unpleasant consequences. Sir, would you like to say something about that?

MR PRICE: Well, we have no indication, as you also heard from our Indian partners, that this incident was anything other than an accident. We refer you, of course, to the Indian Ministry of Defense for any follow-up. They issued a statement on March 9th to explain precisely what had happened. We don’t have a comment beyond that.

QUESTION: If we talk about the safety issues, this is not the first time we’re hearing all this. A few months ago, there was an incident of uranium theft in India, and its citizens have been arrested while smuggling uranium. Sir, have you ever raised concerns on this incident and talk about it during your diplomatic conversations in India?

MR PRICE: I’m not familiar with that particular incident. What I would say is that nuclear safety around the world, especially in countries – nuclear-armed countries, it is always a conversation that is ongoing.

Yes, Nick.

QUESTION: Switch to Iran.

MR PRICE: Iran, sure.

QUESTION: The Iranian Foreign Ministry today said the U.S. needs to make a decision, whether to revive the JCPOA. That mirrors the language from you on Friday saying it was essentially in – the ball was in the court of Moscow and Tehran. How would you define or describe the status of these negotiations today? And then, did the missile attack over the weekend near Erbil, which the IRGC is taking credit for, affect the calculus of this at all?

MR PRICE: Well, as we said on – late last week, last Friday, Special Envoy Malley and his team returned to Washington that day for consultations. Other political directors have also returned to their respective capitals. These are complex negotiations. We are at what could amount to something close to the finish line, but as we’ve said, there are a few outstanding issues, and when you reach, when you near the finish line, the issues that are outstanding are, by definition, going to be the hardest issues there are.

You’ve also heard in recent days, including from Josep Borrell, including from a statement that the E3 issued, that there are now some external factors that are weighing on where we are. You may have seen the statement from the E3, our French, our German, our British partners, that came out over the weekend. It said, “Nobody should seek to exploit JCPOA negotiations to obtain assurances that are separate to the JCPOA.” We would certainly endorse that statement. We continue to believe that it is profoundly in our national interest to see to it that Iran is permanently and verifiably barred from obtaining a nuclear weapon. We’ve heard from our European allies that they are squarely with us. Of course, it does not stand to reason that it would benefit the PRC or Russia, for that matter, if Iran were in a position to acquire a nuclear weapon. Much to the contrary.

When it comes to what we saw over the weekend, let me just say first that the Secretary had an opportunity to speak yesterday to Prime Minister Kadhimi and to Iraqi Kurdistan Prime Minister Masrour Barzani. He shared his outrage and condemnation at the Iranian missile attack near Erbil. These were attacks that were attacks against the sovereign state of Iraq. These were clear violations of Iraq’s sovereignty. The Secretary expressed his solidarity with the Iraqi people, and agreed with Prime Minister Kadhimi that the attack demonstrated the need for Iraqi unity and the urgency in that regard of forming – forming a – forming a government accountable to the Iraqi people that protects Iraq’s territorial integrity. He also conveyed our commitment to working with the Iraqi Government and others in the region to hold Iran – to hold Iran accountable, working with the Iraqi Government to do so. This incident is being investigated by Iraqi Security Forces. We would refer you to them for further comment.

The broader point is that Iran poses a threat to our partners in the region and, by extension, us in a number of different ways. And we’ve spoken of Iran’s nefarious activities, going beyond its nuclear advancements and its nuclear provocations. We have seen Iran, of course, fund proxies in the regions – in the region, fund terrorist groups, engaged in – engage in malicious cyber activity. But the basic point is that Iran would be able to do all of these things, and potentially more, with far greater impunity if it were not verifiably and permanently constrained from obtaining a nuclear weapon.

So, our focus on seeing to it that Iran can never obtain a nuclear weapon, that is not something we are going to walk away from. We are committed, President Biden is committed, to seeing to it that Iran can never obtain a nuclear weapon.

Yes, Vivian.

QUESTION: I have a Ukraine question, but I actually wanted to follow up on that first. So how optimistic are you? You mentioned these external interests and external factors. How optimistic are you that some of those, namely Russia’s interest in trade with Iran, going to be resolved in the coming days, and that it won’t completely derail talks?

MR PRICE: Well, we should have a better sense in the near future whether there is a path forward for these specific talks. I don’t want to go into it beyond that, but when it comes to these external factors, when it comes to these outstanding issues, we should have a better sense in the coming days.

QUESTION: Great, thanks. And on Ukraine, there’s reports that the Biden administration is considering accelerating its support for Ukrainian refugees with U.S. ties, and particularly families that are already living here. Can you talk about sort of where those interests stand – where those efforts stand, and whether or not there is going to be an expedition of any kind of resettlement?

MR PRICE: Well, I can speak generally to that, and what I can say is that the United States continues to provide significant humanitarian assistance to Ukrainians inside Ukraine, those who have been displaced internally – that is to say, individuals still in Ukraine – and those who have been forced to flee their homes. We have, even in recent weeks, provided about $100 million in assistance. We also know – and we saw this ourselves when we were traveling in Poland – especially in Poland – last week, that a number of countries bordering Ukraine have demonstrated tremendous generosity in opening their communities and opening – and offering a welcome to the more than two million Ukrainians who have been forced to flee their homes in recent days.

It’s true that there are – many of these Ukrainian refugees have families, have family, have loved ones who are in neighboring countries. And for many of these individuals, it likely will make sense for them to remain with families, with family, with loved ones, rather than travel much further afield. We will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to support refugees in neighboring countries. When it comes to the United States, we have a ceiling that is set every year. Within that ceiling, there are categories, including refugees from that part of the world. If there is a need for Ukrainian refugees to be resettled farther afield from neighboring countries, that is something that we will look at very closely.

We have time and again proven ourselves to be a country that welcomes refugees, that welcomes immigrants, that recognizes that there is strength in doing so and has consistently derived strength from doing that.

Paul.

QUESTION: You were talking about impact of sanctions and stuff on Russia and the economy’s going to hurt and stuff, but that’s over a while. I mean, Russian forces —

MR PRICE: Well, I – look, I mean —

QUESTION: Well, I mean, that’s going to be a while. There – I’m talking about the people —

MR PRICE: It’s – Paul, that’s today. It is today.

QUESTION: The question – that doesn’t do anything for the people in Ukraine, is – what I’m saying is that my question is: Russian forces continue to shell, to kill, they’ve shown they can extend the war to the Polish border, and it seems like diplomacy has stalled – I mean, what can you tell the Ukrainian people on the ground right now? What can you say to give them any hope?

MR PRICE: Well, let me just fill in one element of that. The toll, the economic toll is not something that we will see develop only over time. We’re seeing that very clearly today. I just went through some of those metrics from the stock market being closed since the first hours of the invasion to the ruble going through the floor, from Russia’s credit rating being at junk status – go on and on and on.

So that is very much today, and I think this gets to the broader point. We are pursuing two complementary tracks in service of one overarching objective, and that overarching objective is to effect an end to this senseless war, put an end to this brutal violence. The first track is what we are doing to support our Ukrainian partners, and specifically the massive security assistance that we are providing to our Ukrainian partners to enable them to defend themselves effectively against these Kremlin aggressors. Over the weekend, we announced another tranche of $200 million in security assistance, bringing the total this year to $550 million. We are grateful for the passage through Congress of a spending bill that had something along the lines of $13.6 billion in additional funding for our efforts with Ukraine and Ukrainian people. A large sum of that, about half of that, will be in the form of security assistance. So, we do expect to be able to do even more going forward.

The second element is what we’re doing to put the squeeze on President Putin and the Kremlin, and it’s precisely what we were just referencing a moment ago. This is a President who often likes to say that big nations don’t bluff. President Putin miscalculated if he thought we were bluffing when we, together with our partners and allies around the world, talked about the consequential, strong, swift, severe economic and financial measures that we would enact if this war of choice went forward.

And as I just noted, when the war did go forward, when President Putin made the grave mistake to commit this aggression, we in turn went forward with this package of measures that we have since escalated – precisely because President Putin has not only not de-escalated – he in fact has escalated. So, both of these tracks are – we view them as complementary.

QUESTION: Ned, you just – I’m sorry to interrupt, but you just said he has not de-escalated, he has escalated. So, if I’m on the ground in Ukraine, I don’t see any hope for a resolution.

MR PRICE: Just as Putin is escalating, so are we with our response, and we will continue to do that. Both of these tracks – the security assistance that we’re providing to our Ukrainian partners and the measures that we’re enacting against the Russian – the Kremlin’s war machine, its economy, its financial system, against Putin personally, against senior Russian officials personally, against their cronies, against oligarchs – both of these are putting tremendous pressure and will increasingly put pressure on the Kremlin. And I think you see the results of this security assistance in terms of what we’re not seeing, have not yet seen, from the Russian operation inside Ukraine. This is now day 19, I believe, of this war in Ukraine. The fact that the Ukrainians have been able to repel, to stall, to take on in self-defense these invading Kremlin forces, I think speaks to the effectiveness with which they are defending their country, defending themselves, doing so with the substantial security assistance that the United States, that our allies and partners have provided.

And we are going to continue to provide that similarly – unless there is a change in course, we will continue to mount pressure on President Putin, on the Kremlin, on his cronies, on the oligarchs, on all of those who in any way touch this Kremlin war machine. We are going to see the pressure continue to mount, and that pressure will mount until President Putin changes course.

QUESTION: Ned, on (inaudible) and the 200 million that was announced over the weekend, are you in a position to be more specific about what that is, or is it essentially – and I don’t want to say this disparagingly – is it more of the same of what you have already been sending, or is there anything significantly new in this package?

MR PRICE: So, we’re not speaking to every specific element of our security assistance. What I can say is that this package enabled us to provide more in the way of anti-armor, anti-aircraft, anti-tank, small arms, munitions, precisely what our Department of Defense colleagues have concluded that the Ukrainians need to defend themselves. We’re always doing an analysis as to the threat that they face, and what more we might be in a position to provide to help them take on that threat, and we are adjusting accordingly based on those needs.

Humeyra.

QUESTION: Just can you clarify? When you said there was going to be clarity in the coming days whether there is a path for these specific talks with Iran, can you just, like, expand on what you meant? And why are you calling it external factors now? You mean, like, Russia’s last-minute demands? Is that what you mean?

MR PRICE: Clearly there are decisions that need to be taken in Tehran. Clearly there are decisions that need to be taken in Moscow. We expect to have a better sense in the coming days whether a path forward with a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA is achievable. We’re —

QUESTION: Is there – sorry – is there a difference in your decision, in U.S. decision, to not entertain Russia’s demands, these last-minute demands? Or are you open to sort of taking a look at them and maybe negotiating with Russia on them?

MR PRICE: We are not. We have been very clear that the new Russia-related sanctions are unrelated to the JCPOA and should not have any impact on its implementation. We have no intention of offering Russia anything new or specific as it relates to these sanctions, nor is there anything new required to successfully reach an agreement on a mutual return to full implementation of the JCPOA.

But let me make one other point, to your question. The President, as I’ve said, has been clear that one way or another, Iran will not be able to obtain a nuclear weapon. We are committed to seeking a diplomatic resolution to this nuclear crisis. We continue to believe that a mutual return to full implementation of the JCPOA is the best way to address that, but if external factors make JCPOA reimplementation impossible, we will of course be open to diplomatic alternatives. We’re not going to speculate; we hope not to have to get there. But we will soon have a better sense as to whether a path to mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA remains viable.

QUESTION: Well, that’s kind of interesting. Is it – you’re going to exclude Russia from it?

MR PRICE: I hope to occasionally say something interesting from up here.

(Laughter.)

QUESTION: Well, okay, and that’s something. I mean, how exactly do you think you can go about excluding a member of the – a permanent member of the Security Council from this if you want it to have the imprimatur, as did the JCPOA, of the Security Council?

MR PRICE: Matt, we continue to believe —

QUESTION: Are you going to do a bilateral deal with Iran?

MR PRICE: We continue to – on that point, of course, we’ve made the point that this would be much more effective were we able to engage bilaterally on these pressing and urgent matters. The Iranians heretofore have not been open to that. But again, we continue to believe that the JCPOA, a mutual return to compliance with it, remains the best vehicle to achieve our policy objectives, that is to —

QUESTION: Yeah, but you just said if you can’t get there —

MR PRICE: That’s right.

QUESTION: — you’re open to an alternative.

MR PRICE: That’s correct.

QUESTION: So, the alternative is what, a U.S.-E3-Iran deal without – excluding the – your new nemeses, or not so new, Russia and China?

MR PRICE: We are not at that point, and we’re not going to – we hope not to get there. Unless and until we are there, we’re not going to speculate on what that might look like, but we are committed to seeing to it that Iran can never obtain a nuclear weapon.

Yes.

QUESTION: Concerning the possible trip of President Biden to Europe, can you tell us little bit more about it? Why now, and will he go to Cologne?

MR PRICE: I can’t, and I would need to refer you to the White House to speak to any travel that the President may or may not undertake. What I will say, however – and the same is true of this building, Secretary Blinken, Deputy Secretary Sherman, Toria Nuland, and others – that we have been in constant consultation and coordination with our allies and partners around the world.

Some weeks ago, we pointed to a couple hundred engagements that we had had with allies and partners around the world. That number is dramatically larger now, and speaking for principals in this building, we have had an opportunity now to see our allies and partners in person. We were just in Europe last week, at Brussels, where we saw all of our NATO Allies, our EU allies, our G7 counterparts; we went to our Baltic allies to send a strong message of solidarity and reassurance; we went to Moldova and France as well. So, for – and, of course, the Secretary saw Foreign Minister Kuleba inside of Ukraine.

So, we have at every opportunity coordinated closely – coordinated closely on our efforts to hold Russia to account, to mount pressure on the Kremlin for this war of choice, and to support our Ukrainian partners. And I think, by any metric that you evaluate, whether it’s the UN vote, whether it’s the statements of condemnation of President Putin and the Kremlin, whether it’s the statements and signs of solidarity, of support for and with Ukraine, you see that those efforts have paid off in an appreciable and meaningful way.

Yes.

QUESTION: Do you have any information on the presence of the Wagner Group in Ukraine, the number of mercenaries?

MR PRICE: We have seen reports of such. Again, this would be another indication that President Putin’s plan is not going according to plan, the idea that the Kremlin would need to call in reinforcements. And last week we spoke to reinforcements that reportedly may be called in from other battlefields, the presence of private mercenary groups; reports that President Putin is desperately seeking a lifeline from other countries.

All of these point to the fact that President Putin has made several grave miscalculations. He gravely miscalculated that his forces would not find fierce resistance going into Ukraine, taking on the Ukrainian people; he miscalculated that he wouldn’t find opposition at home, and we have now seen Russians peacefully take to the streets in dozens of Russian cities, including President Putin’s own hometown, St. Petersburg, where there, like Moscow, like in other Russian cities and towns across the country, peaceful protesters have been arrested for doing nothing more than exercising what is their universal right to freedom of expression, freedom of assembly. More than 14,000 such protesters had been detained as of last week. That number is likely larger now. And President Putin also miscalculated if he thought that the United States and the rest of the world wasn’t serious about imposing these massive costs and consequences that we have since imposed on the Kremlin for undertaking this war effort.

Yes, please.

QUESTION: Back to Iran, real quickly. What are you telling families of American detainees in Iran who are expecting to have some kind of deal in parallel to the return to JCPOA?

MR PRICE: Well, there’s a very simple reason why we have never tied the fate of these American detainees to the JCPOA or any other diplomatic effort, because any diplomatic effort is at best an uncertain proposition. We want to see their safe release, their return to their families, a certain proposition. So, we have been discussing this on a separate track. We have no higher priority than the safety, security of our American citizens, including those American citizens who have been detained overseas, including in Iran. The team has been working tirelessly on this and will continue to do that regardless of the fate of the JCPOA.

QUESTION: And about the Russian – and the Americans in – detained in Russia, I’d like to know if there’s anything new on that. Have you had any consular access to Brittney Griner?

MR PRICE: So, we discussed this on Friday, I believe it was. Our team at our embassy in Moscow continues to provide all forms of appropriate support to Americans who are detained in Moscow. We last had consular access to Paul Whelan and Trevor Reed late last year. We – whenever an American is detained anywhere around the world, and that includes Russia, we stand ready to provide all appropriate assistance.

The same, of course, is true of Ms. Griner. We have been following this case very closely, working through multiple channels to provide all appropriate support, but not in a position to offer further details on that.

Yes.

QUESTION: On Saturday, Saudi Arabia carried out a mass execution of 81 people, drawing condemnation from rights groups. Does the United States also condemn the executions?

MR PRICE: Well, we’ve these reports that Saudi Arabia executed 81 people on March 12th. We continue to raise with Saudi Arabia the need to ensure fair trial guarantees, freedom from arbitrary and extrajudicial detention, transparency, the rule of law, and freedom of religion and belief.

QUESTION: So that’s it?

QUESTION: (Off-mike.)

QUESTION: You don’t have anything else to say about 81 people just being summarily – being executed?

MR PRICE: We are – we have been clear about our concerns about the lack of respect for fair trial guarantees in Saudi Arabia. We’ve documented this in our human rights reports. We’ve raised these concerns with the Saudi Government. We’ll continue to do so. What we want to see, and we’ve made this very clear to our counterparts in Riyadh, is for all governments, including our Saudi partners, to respect and protect human rights and to ensure a fair and transparent judicial process.

QUESTION: Okay, fine. Well, do you think that happened here?

MR PRICE: Matt, we are continuing to raise concerns about fair trial guarantees. I’m not in a position to speak —

QUESTION: Well, do you think that any —

MR PRICE: I’m not in a position to speak to specific cases that were included in what transpired on Saturday, but these are concerns that we continue to raise in Riyadh.

QUESTION: Did you express concern over the weekend?

QUESTION: Because —

MR PRICE: Can’t speak to the timing of that, but we have raised these concerns and we will —

QUESTION: So you didn’t call them after this happened or when you saw the report.

MR PRICE: Humeyra, I didn’t – you’re – please don’t put words in my mouth.

QUESTION: But did you have communication with Saudi authorities after this?

MR PRICE: We are in touch with our Saudi partners on a daily basis. We raise these concerns, and we will continue to do so.

QUESTION: Right. But, I mean, you began – this administration began with this kind of rejection of the previous administration’s quote/unquote – what some people called quote/unquote “kid gloves treatment” of Saudi Arabia, said you were going to put human rights at the fore. Now, it’s one thing if you don’t think that there’s an issue with the mass execution of 81 people over the weekend, but if you —

MR PRICE: In the category of not putting words in my mouth, I did not say that.

QUESTION: I know. I know

MR PRICE: Yeah.

QUESTION: I’m saying it’s one thing if you don’t think that that is an issue. But if you do think that it’s an issue, why aren’t you coming out more forcefully and talking about it?

MR PRICE: We are talking about it, and I just spoke of our —

QUESTION: You talked about fair trial guarantees and that kind of thing. But you didn’t say anything about the executions, and whether you thought that they were —

MR PRICE: We’re talking about – you were – I offered that in the context of the question about the 81 executions that took place on Saturday.

QUESTION: Right.

MR PRICE: These are concerns that we have expressed very clearly to our Saudi partners. They know that for —

QUESTION: But do they know that you think that – that you have concerns about the mass execution of 81 people?

MR PRICE: Matt, they are well aware of our concerns.

QUESTION: About this? Okay.

MR PRICE: They are well aware of our concerns.

QUESTION: And how – how do you know they are well aware? Like, was there any kind of communication after this happened?

MR PRICE: Humeyra, we are in daily communication with our Saudi partners. They are —

QUESTION: If you guys are really worried about this, then why wasn’t any – there any communication?

MR PRICE: Humeyra, I have told you several times now, please don’t put words in my mouth. We communicate with them on a daily basis. They are well aware of concerns.

Yes.

QUESTION: Just to stay on the Middle East, is the Biden administration still actively reviewing whether the reimpose a Houthi terror designation?

MR PRICE: There is – this is a process that does remain under review. You heard that from the President a number of weeks ago. We are in the interim – and you’ve seen us do this already – going to continue to hold Houthi leaders accountable for the attacks, including those attacks that they have perpetuated against our partners in the region. We are going to continue to work to address the underlying causes and some of the underlying tensions, including this civil war that has propagated a humanitarian emergency, that has inflicted untold suffering on Yemen’s population. Some 16, 17 million Yemenis are now suffering from food insecurity as a result of this humanitarian catastrophe, which has only been worsened by the Houthi offensives.

In that regard, we are also going to make sure that anything we do, that any step we take, does not exacerbate the humanitarian emergency that is plaguing Yemen, at the moment, and that everything we do is in service of bringing more hope, more stability, more security to the people of Yemen. We believe we can do that most effectively and efficiently by continuing down the diplomatic path, by supporting the diplomatic process that the UN Special Envoy Hans Grundberg and his team are leading, and Tim Lenderking, for our part, will continue to do that.

Thank you all very much.

QUESTION: Thank you.

MR PRICE: Good afternoon. Good to see everyone.

A couple things at the top. President Putin chose to launch this brutal, unprovoked war against Ukraine. Just as he is engaged in aggression beyond his borders, he is acting even more repressively at home.

Despite Putin’s crackdown on free media and his government’s continued peddling of blatant lies, we have seen many Russians bravely stand up against Putin’s war, including on state-run TV. Now nearly 15,000 Russians have been detained by Russian authorities for doing just that, for exercising the rights that are as universal to them as to citizens around the world. We support the voices of the people of Russia who are calling for an end to this war, who refuse to let their principled views be silenced, who refuse to let a new Iron Curtain descend again around Russia.

Russian journalists are being prosecuted for doing the vital work that you all do here, which is to report, to interview, and to share the truth about what is happening. The people of Russia have a right to know about the thousands and thousands of casualties that the Russian Federation’s forces are taking right now in Ukraine, as well as the civilian casualties and the widespread destruction of civilian infrastructure Putin is inflicting on the people of Ukraine.

There are thousands of Russian mothers who will never see their sons again, yet the media in Russia is not allowed to share that information with the people of Russia, obscuring the real costs of this war. Those who dare to speak up are branded as liars, they’re branded as traitors, and they are subject to prosecution.

We stand with Russian citizens of conscience as they seek to exercise their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. We will hold responsible those who engage in human rights abuses. We will ensure that credible allegations of war crimes are investigated and those involved are held responsible.

To that end, as you saw earlier today, the Secretary announced a series of actions in response to President Putin’s premeditated, unjustified, and unprovoked war against Ukraine and its people, as well as the Lukashenka regime’s efforts to enable Russia’s further invasion. This war does not reflect the will of the peoples of Russia and Belarus. Indeed, their respective governments’ aggressive behavior abroad is coupled with systemic and increasing repression within their own borders. We are witnessing an autocratic attack on democracy.

U.S. actions today include sanctions and visa restrictions on Russian and Belarusian officials and private individuals involved in human rights abuses, corruption, and repression.

The United States and our partners and allies – we are committed to imposing massive, severe costs on those involved in the invasion of Ukraine.

As Russian soldiers continue to die needlessly in Ukraine and the economic consequences of the war mount within Russia, the world remains open to genuine diplomacy. We will, together with our Ukrainian partners and our allies and partners around the world, continue to pursue every avenue to de-escalate the conflict, end the bloodshed, and save lives.

Next, today we acknowledge the anniversary of the Syrian uprising. On this day 11 years ago, the Syrian people took to the streets in the name of freedom, reform, and human rights. Bashar al-Assad responded to this peaceful call with brutality, sparking a war against his own people that has killed hundreds of thousands, displaced more than 13 million, brought food insecurity to some 12 million, and left 14.6 million people in need of humanitarian assistance.

As we stand with the Syrian people, we continue our efforts to explore – to secure a nationwide ceasefire, expand access to humanitarian aid, achieve justice and accountability for the Syrian people, and reach a political resolution as outlined by UN Security Council Resolution 2254. We will not normalize relations with Assad until and unless there is irreversible progress towards that political solution. The Syrian people deserve nothing less after more than a decade of war.

Before I turn to your questions, I just had – want to add one final element. I know all of us in this room were heartbroken yesterday to learn that our colleague, Ben Hall, sustained injuries while reporting from Ukraine. And today I understand that Fox News has announced that his camera operator, Pierre Zakrzewski, lost his life in the same attack.

All of us know Ben. We’ve traveled the world with him. Many of you knew Pierre, who was renowned for his talent documenting conflict zones around the world. Our thoughts are with Pierre’s loved ones, his family, and all of us here at the department are rooting for Ben and rooting for his speedy recovery.

Ben’s collegiality, his sense of humor, his wit, his warmth have always been a balm for the very tough questions that he would always hurl my way, at the way of Secretary Blinken. I know I speak for the Secretary when I say that we look forward, once again – hopefully very soon – to being on the receiving end of all of those. We have engaged at multiple levels with Fox News. We have made very clear that we will do everything we possibly can to help Ben and any others who may have been involved and injured in this horrific attack.

So with that, I’ll take your questions.

QUESTION: Thanks, Ned. I don’t see Rich or Nick in here, so I’ll say – I don’t want to speak for Fox, but thank you for those comments, and on behalf of the whole press corps, thank you for that. We appreciate it.

Before going into Ukraine, I just wanted to ask – one thing that you just said about the anniversary of the Syria situation struck me as a bit unusual. You said, “We will not normalize relations with Assad until and unless…” and then you gave the conditions. When did it become a possibility that the U.S. would ever normalize relations with Assad?

MR PRICE: Well, I —

QUESTION: For a long time the line was his days are numbered, going back almost 11 years now.

MR PRICE: It has been 11 years, Matt. It has been 11 years since a peaceful uprising was met with the iron fist of the Assad regime —

QUESTION: Yes, I get it. So when – so has there been a decision made that you could, in fact, go back to having normal relations with a government in Syria that is led by Bashar al-Assad?

MR PRICE: Matt, there can never be normal relations with a government that has treated its own population, its own people with the level of brutality, with the level of violence, with the level of suppression, the use of chemical weapons, other forms of horrific violence that we’ve seen from this regime. We’ve made our position clear when it comes to holding the Assad regime accountable. We have not, we will not lift sanctions on Bashar al-Assad or his regime. We will continue to oppose reconstruction led by or for the Assad regime until and unless there is irreversible progress on that political solution that is laid out in UN Security Council Resolution 2254.

QUESTION: But you’re saying it is possible for the U.S. to have a normal relationship with a government led by Assad if those conditions are met?

MR PRICE: Matt, I do not think there will ever be a normal relationship with —

QUESTION: Well, you said – you were the one who used the word “normalize,” so I just —

MR PRICE: There – I think that term has come up in the context of other governments that have approached the Assad regime. We have made very clear that the United States Government will maintain our sanctions on the regime. We continue to support the political process that’s laid out in UN Security Council Resolution 2254. We continue to stand with the people of Syria in that regard.

QUESTION: On Ukraine, I just have two brief ones that are kind of diplomatically related. Both of them have to do with Russia. You mentioned the sanctions that you guys imposed today on them, but they also imposed sanctions on several – the President, the Secretary, the Secretary of Defense, others. I noticed you were left off the list, but —

MR PRICE: I’m feeling left out.

QUESTION: But I’m just – the White House – obviously, your colleague at the White House addressed this earlier and said, well, none of us have bank accounts in Russia, none of us are planning to go to Sochi for vacation or anything like that. But that’s exactly what the Russians say about the sanctions that you put on them, that they essentially have no impact and – so I’m just wondering what you have to say about the sanctions that they imposed.

And then the second one, which I’m sure your response will be extremely brief, is: Do you have any comment about Russia formally withdrawing from the Council of Europe?

MR PRICE: So first, on the sanctions, look, I don’t have a specific response to it. I will let my esteemed colleague who is now the subject of Russian sanctions – I will let her response stand, but let me make a couple general points. Number one, you asked how our sanctions are any different from their sanctions.

QUESTION: No, no, I’m – I know how they’re different, but when you blow off their sanctions and say, well, none of us have bank accounts there or none of us – well, that’s exactly the same thing as – that the Russians say.

MR PRICE: Well, so I’ll make a couple points there. Number one, anyone who claims that the measures we have imposed, whether on individuals or the Russian economy or the Russian financial system – anyone who claims that those measures have been inconsequential has not been in Russia, has not been observing what has happened to the Russian economy and to the Russian financial system. This is an economy that is in a tailspin. It is an economy that is reeling. It is an economy that is suffering the worst setback, the worst couple weeks that it has had since the demise of the Soviet Union.

Thirty years of economic integration have been undone over the span of some two weeks, and you can look at any measure – the Russian stock market, which has now been closed for weeks, will be closed at least through the course of this week, presumably to prevent capital flight; the fact that the ruble is almost virtually worthless, literally worth less than a penny; the fact that a – hundreds of international companies are fleeing, heading for the doors, wanting no part and no role in supporting Putin’s war effort; the fact that inflation is skyrocketing; the fact that Russia’s credit rating is now essentially at junk status – I could go on and on and on.

That – those are the sanctions and economic measures that are targeting the Russian system broadly. You look at those measures that are targeting Russian individuals, oligarchs, cronies, President Putin, Foreign Minister Lavrov, Sergei Shoigu, Dmitry Peskov, others. We’ve already had cases of asset seizures, assert forfeitures. There will be more of that. The Department of Treasury, the Department of Justice – they are working closely with their counterparts around the world to go after yachts, to go after aircraft, to go after ill-begotten gains that have been plundered and pilfered from the Russian people. That will continue.

Let me make one other point. I saw that the Russians called this, in a sense, a reciprocal measure. I think – I certainly took umbrage at that term, noting that nothing can be reciprocal, given that we imposed the measures we did in response to President Putin starting a premediated, unprovoked, unjustified war against a civilian population next door. We imposed our measures in response to the untold death and destruction, the killing of civilians in Ukraine, the loss of life that both sides have already endured. We imposed our measures for the destruction – an attempt at destruction of an entire country. And we imposed our measures in response to President Putin’s apparent thought that he could flout the basic tenets of the rules-based international order, the rules that all countries have abided by, the rules that have really set the predicate for some 70-plus years of untold levels of stability, security, prosperity around the world, whether that’s in Europe, whether that’s in the Indo-Pacific, whether that is anywhere in between.

So there’s nothing reciprocal about what the Russians have done versus what we together with our allies and partners have sought to do. What the Russian Federation has done is start a war, has caused untold loss of life in Ukraine, among Ukrainians, among Ukrainian civilians – men, women, children, maternity hospitals, residential buildings, not to mention the Russians who have also lost their lives in this needless war. President Putin has started a war. We are doing everything we can with our measures, with our other steps, to end the war.

QUESTION: Council of Europe?

MR PRICE: Oh, Council – Council of Europe.

QUESTION: Does that register with you or does it – you think it doesn’t matter? I mean, I know you’re not part of the Council of Europe so —

MR PRICE: Well, we are aware that Russia has informed the Council of Europe that it intends to withdraw. Of course, we would refer you to the council for next steps. We did previously welcome the Council of Europe’s suspension of the Russian Federation for its aggression in Ukraine. We similarly welcomed the parliamentary assembly’s strong statements of support for Ukraine in the extraordinary session that was held. And we share the Council of Europe’s values – human rights, democracy, the rule of law. Russia clearly does not share these same values. I think it is only appropriate that Russia is not a member of such a council.

QUESTION: So you’re not concerned that this shuts down yet another potential channel of communication?

MR PRICE: We have plenty of potential channels for communication. What we need to see from the Russian Federation is the Russian Federation engage in good faith with seriousness of purpose through those channels.

Humeyra.

QUESTION: Just to follow up a little bit on the action. EU today, for example, took action to freeze the asset of Abramovich. As far as I know, U.S. has not done anything on that, on that particular individual. Are you guys planning to? Because there was a time where you said from this podium that you were – that U.S. was looking to catch up with EU and make some of the measures symmetrical.

And I also would love your response on what does the U.S. make of Abramovich’s, like, recent moves? He was in Israel, Turkey, Russia. Does the U.S. see him as a potential interlocuter? He’s not just a private citizen.

MR PRICE: So a couple points, Humeyra. First, and most importantly, in response to your question, we don’t preview any actions that we may or may not take. What I will say – and you referenced this – is that European Union, they have their own authorities; they have their own capabilities. We have our own authorities; we have our own capabilities. What we have done each over time is to harmonize the steps we have taken in important regards.

So there have been times where we have taken action against entities, against individuals that the Europeans, other countries and partners around the world in turn followed suit. There have been times where the European Union has, in the first instance, taken such action and we have later harmonized our authorities going after similar targets. I certainly have no doubt that we will continue – the EU will continue, our partners and allies around the world will continue – to go after oligarchs, to go after cronies, to go after all of those who are in one way or another aiding and abetting Putin’s war effort, playing a role in his war machine.

Just look at what we did today, one day alone. We announced actions against 91 individuals and one entity. We used five different authorities across two departments – the Department of State and the Department of the Treasury. I won’t go through the whole roster, but there were visa restrictions under Section 7031(c) of the Department of State Foreign Operations and Related Programs Appropriations Act of last year. There were designations pursuant to an executive order, 14024. There was – there were visa restrictions announced under Section 212(a)(3)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. This is a new authority that allows us to go after current and former government – Russian Government officials believed to be involved in suppressing dissent in Russia and around the world.

There were imposition of visa restrictions on six individuals under the Khashoggi ban. Of course, this was a new authority that we announced early in the administration, last year, in response to governments around the world pursuing dissidents extraterritorially. And we also used Presidential Proclamation 8015 to go after 25 individuals responsible for undermining democracy in Belarus.

We will continue to go after those responsible for the war effort in Ukraine. We will continue to go after those responsible for aiding the war effort, those who reside in Belarus. We will continue to go after private individuals whose closeness to the Russian Government, to the Kremlin, whose ill-begotten wealth is a result of illicit activity, plundering what should belong to the Russian people – we will continue to do that, but what we won’t do is preview those actions.

QUESTION: Sure. How about the second part? Do you see that some of these people can actually be interlocutors as well, and with this particular individual? Because you have a task force, are you also keeping an eye on their movements?

MR PRICE: So I’m not going to speak to any particular individual. What I will reiterate is what I told Matt. There are plenty of fora, there are plenty of avenues for diplomacy. We know that our French partners, our German partners, our Israeli partners, our Turkish partners, our Ukrainian partners, of course, have engaged in diplomacy, direct diplomacy with the Russian Federation. What we’re not looking for, what we’re not bereft of, are avenues. What we’re not missing are not fora. What we’re looking for is a genuine display of good faith on the part of the Russian Federation. We need them to show up at any one of these venues to make clear that they are genuinely interested in de-escalation, in putting an end to this conflict, in putting an end to this war, in putting an end to this senseless and needless loss of life.

QUESTION: And you have received no such indication up until this moment?

MR PRICE: I think we will —

QUESTION: Through any channel?

MR PRICE: We will judge that based upon what we see in Ukraine, and what we have seen in Ukraine, including in recent days, including in recent hours, is continued escalation, is continued bombardment of towns, of cities, of residential areas, is continued loss of life.

Paul.

QUESTION: Okay. So I understand all you said about the Russian economy, but the average Russian doesn’t own stocks. The average Russian doesn’t buy a lot of imported goods. The Russian ruble has lost, if I’m right, 35 or 40 percent of its value, which is not as bad as some of the economic crises we’ve seen in a long time. And you haven’t gotten any progress on deconfliction, de-escalation. So what about taking more steps? What about expanding SWIFT things? We continue to send money to Russia for energy purchases. So why aren’t you taking stronger steps to add sanctions on a lot of people who don’t have Western bank accounts or property in the United States? It doesn’t seem to add much pressure.

MR PRICE: So in terms of energy purchases, the President did sign an executive order last week putting an end to our purchase of Russian oil, our purchase of Russian energy.

QUESTION: When I say “we” I mean West – the West in general.

MR PRICE: Well, the point is, Paul, that we have already applied a set of measures that have been unprecedented in terms of their scale, in terms of their scope, and in terms of their impact. And I won’t go through the various metrics of impact again, but they’re clear for everyone to see.

The other point is that as long as President Putin continues to escalate, we, working with our allies and partners, will continue to escalate. You mentioned —

QUESTION: How about the SWIFT measures? Why is it that —

MR PRICE: You mentioned some measures that may be on the table. Going back to what I offered to Humeyra, of course we’re not in a position to preview specifically what we are prepared to do, but what I can tell you that we are prepared to do is continue to escalate the costs. And I should say that the economic sanctions, the other financial measures and economic measures that we have placed on the Russian Federation, that is one important measure to mount pressure on the Kremlin, on President Putin, on those around him. It is clearly putting the squeeze on their economy, on their financial system.

At the same time, we will continue simultaneously to provide our Ukrainian partners with massive amounts of security assistance. In recent weeks alone, we’ve spoken of some $550 million worth of security assistance. Those deliveries are continuing just about every day – anti-armor, anti-tank, anti-aircraft, small arms, munitions, precisely what our colleagues at the Department of Defense have determined that our Ukrainian partners most need to defend their country against this invasion. And we are very fortunate that, given the passage of the spending legislation out of Congress, we now have $13.6 billion for the people of Ukraine in different realms. And a good chunk of that money, about half of it, will be made available in the form of additional security assistance.

So we have provided more than $1.2 billion in security assistance to our Ukrainian partners over the course of the past year. We’re going to be in a position to do much, much more given the spending allocation that we recently have had from Congress. That is another avenue that is putting pressure on President Putin, and we have seen that pressure and the effectiveness of that security assistance, the effectiveness of the Ukrainian resistance, in that we are now on day 20 of this Russian invasion, of this Russian war. President Putin’s – certainly cannot be comfortable with what he has seen from his forces on the battlefield. I will leave it to others to offer the military analysis, but again, President Putin gravely miscalculated if he thought that he could dispatch 100,000 forces into a sovereign country and not face and find the stiff resistance that he has found with thousands of Russians, Russian service members losing their lives, with his forces stalled in key areas.

President Putin has gravely miscalculated if he thought he could do all of this without facing opposition at home, and we have seen very prominent displays of that opposition, including in recent hours in ways that would have been unexpected even a few weeks ago: 15,000 people arrested across Russia, across dozens of Russian cities, including in President Putin’s hometown of St. Petersburg, for peacefully exercising the rights that are as universally available to them as to anyone else on the planet, the right to freedom of assembly, the right to freedom of expression. We continue to stand with them. And President Putin, going back to where we started, has gravely miscalculated if he thought that the United States, that our allies and partners were bluffing when we talked about the profound costs that we were prepared to impose on Russia’s economy, on its financial system, on the Kremlin if he were to go forward. President Putin has now found that he made grave miscalculations in all three regards.

John.

QUESTION: (Off-mike.)

MR PRICE: Follow-up? Sure.

QUESTION: Thank you. Paul asked about the more stronger steps and you talked about the military support to Ukraine, but one of those more stronger steps might be the transferring to Ukraine their old Soviet-era weapons. And so could you – including S-300. So could you comment on the CNN, today’s report, that reportedly State Department is already involved in the talks with the European partners and creating such a list?

MR PRICE: So we are in constant discussion with our Ukrainian partners in the first instance about their needs, their security needs. I can say that Secretary Blinken spoke to Foreign Minister Kuleba again today. They discussed Ukraine’s security needs once again. Working very closely with our colleagues at the Department of Defense, we have put together packages of defensive security assistance that our Ukrainian partners most need. And as I said before, that includes anti-armor, that includes tanks – anti-tank, that includes small arms, that includes munitions, and it most certainly includes anti-aircraft and surface-to-air systems.

So we are not detailing every element of those security packages that we are providing, but we are continuing to provide security assistance in all of those realms. We know that Russian missiles, Russian rockets, Russian artillery have wrought destruction across large parts of Ukraine, and we are prepared to and we have provided our Ukrainian partners with the sort of surface-to-air systems, anti-aircraft systems that would help protect themselves against this onslaught, against these attacks.

We are always looking at what’s in our inventories, and also our allies around the world are looking at what’s in their inventories. And Secretary Blinken has on several occasions now authorized our NATO Allies to provide U.S.-origin equipment to our Ukrainian partners. Our inclination has always been to – to be responsive to precisely what our Ukrainian partners need. We have been able to do that with the funding we’ve been granted from Congress, and now that we have $13.6 billion of additional funding to work with, about half of which will go in the direction of security assistance, we’ll be able to do quite a bit more.

QUESTION: Can I just make sure of one thing? You said tanks and then you said anti-tank —

MR PRICE: Anti-tank, anti-tank.

QUESTION: You don’t mean tanks and —

MR PRICE: Anti-tank, anti-tank. Anti-armor.

John.

QUESTION: Ned, just because things are always moving and in the air, since the start of Russia’s invasion, has the United States yet engaged directly with Russia about offramps or ways to reduce violence? Directly – have you engaged directly with Russia about this?

MR PRICE: John, a number of our partners are engaged directly with the Russian Federation at high levels. I think what is clear is that none of these engagements have yet resulted in the diminution of violence and an end to the war in a reduction of the loss of life that we’ve seen across Ukraine. If we determine that high-level U.S. engagement would be advantageous to help move forward with that overriding goal of putting an end to this violence, putting an end to this senseless war, we would absolutely be prepared to do so.

What we have found, however – what our partners and allies have found, however, and what our Ukrainian partners, most importantly, have found, however – is that we have yet to find a Russian interlocutor that is either able or willing to negotiate in good faith, and certainly not in the context of de-escalation, given that Russian forces have continued to escalate, have continued to wreak violence across Ukraine. So we’ll continue to look for diplomatic openings. In the meantime, we will continue to support our Ukrainian partners, as well as the diplomatic efforts that our allies around the world are taking part in.

QUESTION: And then can you just comment on the statements from Moscow about receiving written assurances related to the Iran deal?

MR PRICE: So we’ve discussed this yesterday a bit. What I will say is that we have made significant progress over recent days when it comes to the possibility of a mutual return to compliance with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. We continue to engage with Russia on a return to full implementation of the JCPOA. I think what you heard from Foreign Minister Lavrov – I will let him speak for himself, I will let the Russians speak for themselves – but is – may well be a reflection of the fact that we, of course, would not sanction Russian participation in nuclear projects that are part of resuming full implementation of the JCPOA. We can’t and we won’t and we have not provided assurances beyond that to Russia. We will let Foreign Minister Lavrov speak to – speak for his country, but perhaps it is now clear to Moscow – perhaps a couple things are now clear.

Number one, as we have said publicly, the new Russia-related sanctions are unrelated to a potential return to full compliance with the JCPOA, and they shouldn’t have any impact on its implementation. And it may well be a reflection of what we’ve said all along, that an Iran that is unconstrained in its nuclear program and that has no permanent, verifiable limits attached to that nuclear program – that is not in our interests, it is not in the interests of our European allies, it is not in the interests of the PRC, and it’s certainly not in the interests of the Russian Federation.

I will reiterate one additional point, that you’ve heard several references in recent days to external factors, and we have engaged with the Russian Federation on the possibility of a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA, but as I said the other day, there were and are a small number of outstanding issues. Now that we are this close to the finish line, those outstanding issues tend to be the hardest issues, so we’re not there yet. Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. But we continue to assess that a mutual return to compliance would be the most effective, the best way to verifiably and permanently once again have those limits on Iran’s nuclear program.

Lara.

QUESTION: So to follow up, is it this building’s understanding that the objections that Russia raised in the last few days have now been resolved?

MR PRICE: It is – what I am relaying to you is that you will need to ask the Russians.

QUESTION: But you guys are in the negotiations with them, so is it this building’s understanding that they are no longer objecting?

MR PRICE: We have seen the statements from Foreign Minister Lavrov. We will leave it to the Russian Federation, to Foreign Minister Lavrov, to others to explain exactly what those statements mean. But it is logical – it has been logical to us; it should be logical to all parties – that we would not sanction Russian participation in nuclear projects that are part of a full resumption of the JCPOA if in fact we are able to get there. We have not offered the Russians anything more, there has been nothing additional conveyed, but you’ll have to refer to – you’ll have to ask the foreign minister.

QUESTION: Let me ask it this way: Did you guys understand whatever it was that Lavrov was trying to say? What was your understanding of what he was saying?

MR PRICE: I’m not going to interpret the foreign minister’s remarks. Again, you’ll need to talk to them to ask their position, where they are on a potential mutual return to compliance. We know where the Russian Federation has been in the past. Of course, Russia was an original member of the P5+1, understanding since well before 2015 that a nuclear armed Iran or an Iran on the verge of a nuclear weapon would not be in Moscow’s interest, certainly not in our interest. We hope to be able to complete a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA in short order. We should be able to if negotiators, if the parties come together, negotiate in good faith, and close out these remaining outstanding issues.

QUESTION: Ned, I’m a bit confused. How can you – how can you say for sure that you will not sanction any Russian activity related to the – any return to the deal? The Ukraine-related sanctions well postdate the original JCPOA. I mean, they only date back to February, late February of this year. If there is a Russian – and I realize this is a hypothetical, but you seem to be raising the hypothetical in the answer to your question, and maybe you’re not the right person to ask because it gets into the weeds here – but if there is something that is allowed, an activity that is allowed under the JCPOA, but it involves transactions that are sanctioned by not just the United States, but also the EU under the – with a bank, with a financial institution, a Russian financial institution – how can you say that that’s exempt?

MR PRICE: Well, to be clear, Russia is not getting out of the sanctions and other financial measures that we have —

QUESTION: You just said they would.

MR PRICE: — that we have been —

QUESTION: So if I’m the Russians —

MR PRICE: — that have been imposed for this war in Ukraine. What we are talking about here is the very basic point – something that should be quite clear – that we would not sanction Russian participation in nuclear projects that are part of a full resumption of the JCPOA. These are separate realms; these are separate areas.

QUESTION: Yeah, but if they involve any kind of a money – monetary transaction that touches either the European or American financial systems, or SWIFT for that matter, then you have a problem. I don’t see how you can – how you can exempt them. Because if I’m the Russians and I see that that’s exempted, well, then all of a sudden, every foreign transaction that I do is going to be related to Iran’s nuclear program and therefore exempt under what you’re saying.

MR PRICE: So, Matt, I think two things can be true. One, the JCPOA is not going to be an escape hatch for the Russian Federation and the sanctions that have been imposed on it because of the war in Ukraine. But two, we are not going to sanction Russia for undertaking, for participating in nuclear projects that are part of the JCPOA. You’re right; you’re asking a very weedy question. It’s probably better for —

QUESTION: Okay, then let me add another one to it. It may be better for an expert. But then what about the idea of secondary sanctions? Because any bank or financial institution that would be involved in a transaction – say Russia purchases heavy water from the Iranians or enriched uranium – you’re – this seems to open the Pandora’s box that you keep talking about in other things. It just seems that the Russians would be able to disguise any number of non-Iranian-nuclear-deal transactions through that same channel of exemptions that you’re offering them.

MR PRICE: Well, so – so what you’re raising is a hypothetical wrapped in another hypothetical, the hypothetical that —

QUESTION: I’m sorry, but you’re talking about a deal that doesn’t exist yet, which is a hypothetical.

MR PRICE: Well, that’s my point. No, that’s —

QUESTION: So I’m sorry. Well, my hypotheticals are related —

MR PRICE: That’s —

QUESTION: — are based on your initial hypothetical.

MR PRICE: That’s exactly my point. So rather than get wrapped around the axle of hypotheticals, we’ll —

QUESTION: Well, can we get someone down here to go through this stuff?

MR PRICE: Well, we’ll —

QUESTION: Are we done with Ukraine? I have Ukraine questions.

MR PRICE: Any more Ukraine questions?

QUESTION: Yes.

MR PRICE: Seems like there are a couple Ukraine questions.

QUESTION: Is Robert Malley going back to Vienna this week?

MR PRICE: Rob Malley and his team, they are still based here. I understand that negotiators are still in capitals. If it is prudent, if it is appropriate for Rob and the team to go back to Vienna, they’re prepared to do so.

QUESTION: And on Ukraine, how did the Secretary receive the news of sanctioning him and the President and other U.S. officials by Russia?

MR PRICE: I haven’t discussed him – discussed it with him yet today, but based on previous discussions, I don’t think he’ll be surprised.

QUESTION: He will be able to sleep —

MR PRICE: I’m sorry?

QUESTION: He will be able to go to bed —

MR PRICE: I think he will sleep just as soundly as he otherwise would, which, given that he is Secretary of State, probably isn’t all that soundly.

QUESTION: And on Saudi Arabia, Ned, Saudi Arabia considers accepting the Chinese currency instead of dollars for Chinese oil sales. What’s your reaction to that?

MR PRICE: We don’t have a specific reaction to that. What I would say is that we’ve said time and again that our relationship with the PRC is at its heart competitive. It will be collaborative when it can be, adversarial when it must be. Our allies and partners around the world are going to have their own relationships with the PRC. What we are not asking countries to do is to choose between the United States and China. When it comes to many of our partners, what we seek to do is to give them choices and to make partnership with the United States and all that we bring to the table, all that we could bring to a bilateral relationship – make sure that countries, partners around the world know just how appealing that is.

QUESTION: And one on UAE too. How do you view the UAE conflicting statements on increasing the oil production? Their ambassador in Washington said that they will increase the production, and their energy minister contradicted that.

MR PRICE: I will leave it to our Emirati partners to speak to this question. We, of course, are not a member of OPEC, we’re not a member of OPEC+, but as you know, we have engaged with companies, with countries around the world. We maintain an interest in a steady global energy supply and our diplomatic outreach is a large element of that.

Lara.

QUESTION: So we’ve talked in the past about the possibility of expediting refugee – Ukrainian refugees to the United States. I’m wondering if there’s any update to that, if the position in this building is still that they must apply through UNHCR, which is a process that you know can take months. And over the weekend we saw some people trying to come into the United States from the southern border. Is there any consideration given to humanitarian – for humanitarian parole for Ukrainians who might want to come to the United States, especially if they already have ties, family members in the United States?

And then I have a second question for you on a unrelated Ukraine topic.

MR PRICE: So a couple points. We discussed this a bit yesterday, but there are now nearly 3 million Ukrainians who have been forced to leave their homes because of this violence. We are deeply, deeply grateful to Ukraine’s neighbors, to countries throughout Europe who have so generously opened their arms to welcome these Ukrainian refugees. We recognize the fact that many Ukrainians have family, have loved ones who are in Europe. We expect most Ukrainian refugees will seek to remain in Europe until and unless they can return to their homes, and of course, that is our ultimate objective, to see to it that Ukrainians who have been displaced by this violence, whether they’re one of the 2 million internally displaced persons inside of Ukraine or nearly one of the 3 million – one of the 3 million – one of nearly 3 million Ukrainian refugees who’ve been forced to flee their country, our goal, of course, is to see to it that they can return to their homes once this violence ends.

We are working with UNHCR, with resettlement partners, overseas posts to determine whether Ukrainians who have departed Ukraine require resettlement to a third country because they can’t be protected in their current location. We, as we always do, assess protection needs, and that includes cases of particular vulnerability, as a central tenet of our refugee admissions to address the urgent need for resettlement across all regions. We don’t discriminate on the basis of any country of origin. As we discussed yesterday, our refugee ceiling has various regional categories attached to it. There’s a category for those who would emanate from Ukraine. Any admissions of Ukrainian nationals through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program would be in accordance with that presidential determination on refugee admissions.

What I can say right now is that we have been, we will continue to be a country that welcomes refugees from around the world. We know that as a nation of immigrants, as a nation that has always opened its arms to refugees, we are made stronger, that it is very much in our American DNA to continue doing just that. If there is a need to resettle Ukrainian refugees in the United States, we will look to do so. I have – I am fully confident we will do so. If there are additional authorities or avenues that need to be investigated, I have every – I have full confidence we’ll do that too.

QUESTION: But is the administration considering an expedited process for any people at this point? Do you know?

MR PRICE: So again, I don’t – I wouldn’t want to get ahead of anything, but we do have processes that are in place, including through the U.S. refugee admissions process, where we have the ability to bring in Ukrainian refugees, should the need arise.

QUESTION: Okay. And I also wanted to ask about the case of Brittney Griner. It’s been almost a month since she’s been detained in Russia, and what is the State Department’s understanding of how her conditions are in Russia right now, as she’s being held? And what is the State Department doing to try to get her released?

MR PRICE: There’s not much I can say given the privacy considerations that are implicated in this case. This is a case that we have been working on since the time of her detention. Every time an American is detained overseas, our consular officers, including our consular officers in Moscow, are providing every form of support that we can. In this case, I’m just not able to go into the details, but we are doing everything we can to support Brittney Griner, to support her family, and to work with them, do everything we can, to see that she is treated appropriately and to seek her release.

QUESTION: But it’s correct that you have not had consular access to her?

MR PRICE: I’m just – I could not speak to that at this point, given privacy considerations.

QUESTION: One more —

QUESTION: Well, hold on a second. You – this is a 30-year – almost 30-year battle that I have had. How is she exactly supposed to sign a Privacy Act waiver if you guys can’t get to her to ask her to see if she wants to sign one?

MR PRICE: Matt —

QUESTION: So I get that —

MR PRICE: Matt, with —

QUESTION: So I understand you can’t give details, but surely —

MR PRICE: Well, Matt, there’s a factual answer to your question, if you’ll listen for a moment.

QUESTION: Okay.

MR PRICE: Lawyers do oftentimes, including in the case of Russia – Russian lawyers do have access to clients. Without speaking to any particular case, including this case, Russian lawyers have access to clients in Russia and as appropriate they can pass Privacy Act waivers.

Yes.

QUESTION: But you’re now acknowledging her detention.

MR PRICE: Yes.

QUESTION: So I mean, clearly there is a way you could go. I mean, a couple of weeks ago – or actually last week, you wouldn’t even – you weren’t even able to acknowledge her —

MR PRICE: And what I can say is that I expect we’ll be able to say more in the coming days.

QUESTION: Do you have any sense – can you give us any sense of her condition? Is she being treated well?

MR PRICE: Again, I’m just not in a position to offer updates right now.

Yes, Conor.

QUESTION: Just a follow-up on John’s first question about talks between Russia and Ukraine today. Have U.S. officials been briefed on how those talks went? And in particular Ukrainian officials expressed some optimism afterwards. Do you share that optimism? Everything you said earlier would indicate that you don’t.

MR PRICE: Well, the Ukraine – our Ukrainian partners are the ones who are taking part in these conversations. The conversations over the past couple days have been virtual. But as I mentioned a moment ago, Secretary Blinken did have an opportunity earlier today to speak to Foreign Minister Kuleba. Every time he has spoken to – virtually every time he’s spoken to Foreign Minister Kuleba, the foreign minister has passed on updates regarding the diplomatic efforts. Rather than characterize whether we’re optimistic or pessimistic, again, what we are going to be looking for are developments on the ground. And the developments we want to see are clear: We want to see de-escalation; we want to see a diminution of the violence; we ultimately want to see a withdrawal of Russian forces from inside Ukraine. We have not seen any of those things just yet.

QUESTION: President Zelenskyy today said that Ukrainians should be prepared that the country would not be allowed into NATO. Have you advised his administration at all in these talks, whether or not that should be something that they commit to, to not joining the Alliance?

MR PRICE: Nope. To be very clear, we have consistently underscored not only to our Ukrainian partners, but to countries around the world, that these are sovereign decisions that our Ukrainian partners will need to make for themselves. What we are here to do is to stand by our Ukrainian partners, to support our Ukrainian partners in any decisions that they would choose to make.

Yes.

QUESTION: Just one more on that —

QUESTION: Can I ask just another couple —

MR PRICE: Oh.

QUESTION: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

QUESTION: Just – we talk so much about sovereign decisions of other countries. What about the sovereignty of the United States, in the sense of we obviously have a strong interest in reducing conflict, ending wars, and obviously the longer that this conflict continues the greater the risk of escalation and other things like that. It just seems like you guys are so often shifting to the sovereignty of other powers. The United States has a real stake in this, and why be so reluctant about an outcome that might be in the U.S.’s interest?

MR PRICE: We’re not reluctant about that at all, John. We are doing everything we can to see a diminution of the violence, to see an end to this war. You’re right that every day this war goes on there is the chance of escalation; there’s a chance of broader conflict. But to that end, we’ve done a couple things. Number one, we’ve been very clear about steps that we are not going to take. President Biden has made very clear that American pilots are not going to operate over Ukrainian airspace. American service members are not going to operate on Ukrainian soil.

But number two, we have supported our Ukrainian partners in their efforts to achieve a diplomatic resolution to this conflict. We have supported and we’ve been in close coordination with our French partners, our German partners, our Israeli partners, our Turkish partners, and others who have engaged directly with Russia diplomatically to see that same outcome achieved. We share the same overriding objective with all of those allies, with – with all of those partners. So the idea that we are in any way hesitant to see this conflict come to an end as quickly as it can, that is just not something that rings true.

And I think it’s also fair that no country has done more to support our Ukrainian partners in an effort to bring this conflict to a close – in terms of the diplomacy, in terms of the security assistance, in terms of putting pressure on the Kremlin, on President Putin, on those around him who are responsible for this conflict. And we see all of those lines of effort as complementary – pressure on the battlefield, pressure on the Russian economy, pressure on the Russian financial system, pressure on oligarchs and senior Russian officials personally, and our efforts to support diplomacy – all of those things do support our overriding, overarching goal of seeking to find a diplomatic resolution to this conflict.

Ben – or Conor.

QUESTION: To follow up on your comments on our Fox colleagues, in addition to injuring Ben and killing Pierre, this attack also killed one of their Ukrainian producers. It’s obviously also not the first attack that injured or killed journalists. Do you believe that journalists are being targeted at all in this war?

MR PRICE: We know, of course, that civilians have been killed. We know, of course, that journalists have been killed. There was another American journalist who was killed just a couple days ago, Mr. Renaud. We have seen these reports. What we are doing right now is, through every piece of information available to us, we are documenting, we are trying to discern the facts. If we determine that there is any intentionality here – intentionality in terms of the intentional targeting of civilians or the intentional targeting of journalists or any other group – that should be completely off limits under international humanitarian law, under the Geneva Conventions, under the Law of Armed Conflict. That is something that we would take very seriously, and there would be a very serious response.

QUESTION: Just to follow up on that, so do you guys have, like, a formal review or an investigation where you’re collecting everything? And is there, like, a U.S. Government review where you’re looking into, like, war crimes?

MR PRICE: There are a number of review mechanisms. We’ve spoken to the effort that’s ongoing with the International – with the ICJ, with the UN Commission of Inquiry. The OSCE has its own process; the ICC has its own process. And yes, here within the State Department, we are documenting, we are compiling all of the information, all of the sources of information that we can, to document and to form our own conclusion.

QUESTION: Right, but I mean, are you going to send them off to these different institutions? Or are you going to come up with your own determination?

MR PRICE: Both. We are —

QUESTION: What will be the timeframe for that?

MR PRICE: We are supporting independent investigations. We’re doing our own analysis into what has taken place. I wouldn’t want to put a timeframe on it, but of course, we are, as with all things in this conflict, treating it as a matter of urgency.

QUESTION: Right. Based on what you’ve seen so far, is the administration prepared to say that Russia is committing war crimes?

MR PRICE: If we determine that Russia has committed war crimes, we are absolutely determined to make that public.

Yes.

QUESTION: I have one on Vienna, and also Ukraine.

QUESTION: I have one on Ukraine, if that’s okay.

QUESTION: Yeah, go.

QUESTION: Okay. I am just wondering about this information/disinformation you guys have been really focused on in Russia. Can or should the U.S. Government be providing sources of more accurate information to Russians at this time?

MR PRICE: Well, what I will say is that we have undertaken a concerted effort, through means that are available to us, to do everything we can to get actual, factual, truthful information into what is a pretty closed Russian information ecosystem. We have done that through a number of tactics.

As you know, a number of us have spoken on Russian TV, independent stations, including in some cases independent stations like Dozhd/TV Rain that have been shut down, also through Russian state-backed outlets as well, those that will have on senior American officials. We use tools like Telegram to convey information as well. Every avenue that we can conceive of that would allow us to channel information into Russia, to reach Russian audiences, knowing that the best antidote to disinformation is information. That has been our strategy in speaking to audiences here in the United States and around the world, and it’s a challenge when it comes to Russia because President Putin and the Kremlin, they are doing everything they can to further constrict the information space throughout the country. And so we too are trying to get creative in terms of – in terms of our efforts to channel information in.

QUESTION: What do you mean you’re using Telegram, exactly? And would the U.S. consider putting any satellite internet resources along the border, things like that?

MR PRICE: Well, so let me make a point about internet access in Russia. We know that the Kremlin is engaged in a full assault, as I said before, on media freedom, access to information, and the truth within Russia. Of course, it wants its version of the facts to be the only version of the facts that is available to the Russian people. Moscow’s efforts to mislead, they are intensifying. We condemn the Russian Government’s recent actions to prevent the people of Russia from accessing Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, numerous Russian and international news sites, and certain mobile applications as well. We also condemn the Russian Government’s passage of a new law that threatens prison sentences for accurately reporting on Putin’s war of choice in Ukraine.

The people of Russia – we’ve made this point repeatedly – did not choose this war. President Putin did; those around him did. They have a right, the people of Russia have a right to know about the death, the suffering, the destruction that is being inflicted by their government in their name on the people of Ukraine. The people of Russia also have a right to know about the human costs of this senseless war, including the cost to Russian service members – to their sons, to their brothers, to their husbands. So for that reason, we support access to the internet by all people, including the people of Russia. Even as we stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine, we believe that more information is going to be the answer. Putin believes that less information is what’s in his interests.

So of course, we want to all we can to support that information flow into Russia, to see to it that the Russian people have avenues of communication, have a free and open internet available to them. And we call on President Putin and his government to honor Russia’s international obligations and commitments, to withdraw Russia’s troops from Ukraine’s territory, and to respect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of Russia’s citizens – and one of those fundamental freedoms is freedom of access to information.

QUESTION: Okay, maybe we can follow up on some more specifics later, but just one more quick question on the chemical weapons possibility. We haven’t talked about that in a few days, I guess. Has the Biden administration determined what their response is going to be if Russia uses chemical weapons? Not that you have detail it here, but do you guys have a response ready to go if Russia does use those weapons in Ukraine?

MR PRICE: Kylie, the only thing I will say about that is to reiterate what the President said the other day. If Russia engages in the use of banned agents, including chemical weapons, there will be a severe response from the United States and the international community.

Yes.

QUESTION: Just one more on Vienna talks. As we were walking in, the Iranian foreign minister said that it was on the U.S. to provide the necessary response for a successful outcome. I mean, from that statement it seems like they’re waiting on the U.S. to say something, either through the EU or anybody else, to try to get back to Vienna.

MR PRICE: What I would say is that over the course of the past few weeks, we have made significant progress. We are close. There are external factors involved in this now. There are a small number of outstanding issues. The United States, although not a direct party to the talks, we have worked in good faith. We have sought at every juncture to achieve a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA, knowing that in our assessment it continues to be the most effective means by which to impose, reimpose permanent, verifiable limits on Iran’s nuclear program. There are a small number of outstanding issues. We do think that we would be in a position to close those gaps, to close that remaining distance if there are decisions made in capitals, including in Tehan, including in Moscow.

QUESTION: One thing that – I meant, he – this morning, I mean, the top U.S. military general for the Middle East and the CENTCOM chief, quote, said – said, quote, that Iran likely has decreasing tolerance for continued U.S. presence in Syria. And then he went on: accordingly, Iran and its proxies or affiliates – and its affiliates are increasing the capabilities and plan to target U.S. and partner interests. And then he goes on about more troubling increase, proliferation of this advanced technology. It continues about all these threats and things that are concerning. So how do you justify striking a deal that doesn’t address any of these that impact U.S. national security?

MR PRICE: Well, what I would say is that we’ve been very clear that Iran poses a challenge, poses a threat to United States, to our allies and partners across different realms. The most significant threat we would face would be a nuclear-armed Iran. There would be no greater challenge to the United States, to our allies, to our partners around the world.

That is not to say that Iran’s nuclear program is the other challenge – is the only challenge we face. Iran supports regional proxies, it supports terrorist groups, it has cyber – it has engaged in malicious cyber activity, it has an active ballistic missile program. But what we know is that if Iran were in the possession of a nuclear weapon or if it were on the verge of a possession of a nuclear weapon, it could act with far greater impunity. The the first thing we want to do is to put Iran’s nuclear program back in a box, to take that challenge off the table so that, working with allies and partners, we can confront, we can take on the challenge that Iran poses in these other realms much more effectively. We actually see these goals as quite complementary. Knowing that – and a nuclear-armed Iran is an Iran that would have far greater impunity.

And I’ll make one other point. Our goal is to put the Iranian nuclear program back in a box. It was in a box until 2018. Prior to 2018, when the JCPOA was in full force, in full effect, we did not see the same kinds of provocations that we have seen in – even in recent days. So our goal is to put that challenge – take that challenge off the table, and to work with our allies and partners to address the fuller range of threats that we face from Tehran.

QUESTION: Just a last one, sorry.

MR PRICE: Sure.

QUESTION: It’s quick. I mean, do you fear that – do you fear Russia could be trying to derail these talks in order to prevent Iranian oil from coming back on the international market? Presumably, that’s what they’re going to get under the deal.

MR PRICE: Well, again, whether or not there is a JCPOA, our posture towards an Iranian oil ban would not change. We would not replace Russian oil with Iranian oil; that would not be on the table. Beyond that, you’ll have to speak to Moscow. What I can say is what I’ve already said, that an Iran that is verifiably, permanently barred, prevented from ever obtaining a nuclear weapon, that is equally in our interest as it is in Russia’s interest.

Yes, last quick question?

QUESTION: On the previous question on getting information into Russia, who runs the Telegram operation? And do you have an inter-governmental body that is working, coordinating to try to get this kind of information into Russia? Second question – completely different – General McKenzie told Congress that the U.S. has agreed to – U.S. plans to sell F-15s to Egypt. Has the State Department formally signed off on that?

MR PRICE: We don’t speak to potential arms transfers or arms sales until and unless they’re notified to Congress, so I just wouldn’t have anything to say on that score.

In terms of conveying truthful, accurate message – messaging and information into Russia, that’s something that we’re very focused on as a government.

QUESTION: In the State Department, or —

MR PRICE: It’s something that the State Department is certainly very focused on. It’s something that I know a number of our allies and partners are very focused on as well. And we’re focused on it because Moscow has sought to be a purveyor of information that is false, that is misleading, that is disinformation.

QUESTION: I’m sorry, but who in the government is doing this? And is there an inter – interdepartmental body that is coordinating this – these kind of activities?

MR PRICE: These activities are coordinated across the government. Of course, we work closely with the National Security Council, but a lot of this activity does come out of the State Department in terms of the speaking directly to Russian audiences. If you’ve been on our social media channels, if you have seen what we’ve done with Russian media, independent media, media that is closer to the Russian state, much of that is emanating from the State Department. Of course, our embassy in Moscow is very engaged in this as well.

But I’ll also make the point that our allies and partners around the world have been doing the same, because the disinformation that we have seen emanate from Moscow targets not only the United States and mischaracterizes not only what we have done, but also what our allies and partners around the world are doing. So it is a shared objective of the United States, of our allies and partners to fight this disinformation – this misinformation – with information, with facts, with truth for people here in this country, for people around the world, including people in Russia.

Thank you all very much.

QUESTION: Is Secretary Blinken going Brussels with the President?

The impressive deliveries of defensive weapons to Ukraine’s military, though crucial to the country’s remarkable resistance, have failed to stop Russian President Vladimir Putin’s mounting air strikes on civilian targets and urban centers.

The unprecedented economic and financial sanctions on Russia, though historic in their scope, have been insufficient to deter him from escalating his grinding war on Ukraine.

They aren’t enough.

The unanticipated transatlantic and international unity—including a 141-5 resolution of the United Nations General Assembly demanding Putin withdraw his forces—hasn’t dissuaded him either. What greater sign could there have been that Putin has made himself a pariah than the quartet that voted with him: Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea, and Syria?

Still, that’s not enough.

Too many countries in the world continue to look away. Thirty-five of them abstained from condemning Russia at the United Nations, hoping Putin’s ugliness would pass without forcing them to take a stand against this international crime.

The efforts of the United States and some of our international partners to shame Chinese President Xi Jinping into pulling his support from Putin’s war machine also have failed—though no other country’s actions at this moment could do more to save lives and end the war.

Ahead of the Winter Olympics in Beijing, Putin effectively received Xi’s green light for his invasion in their 5,300-word joint statement, which said their relationship had “no limits.” Putin kept his part of the bargain: not invading until the games ended. For his part, Xi doesn’t yet seem willing to distance himself from Putin in any meaningful way.

What the civilized world has done thus far to respond to Putin’s invasion is a remarkable show of unity. The Biden administration deserves credit for releasing intelligence on Putin’s plans early, thus focusing the narrative and blame where it belongs, and then rallying the world thereafter.

Europe’s combined actions against Putin are particularly impressive, given its proximity to Moscow and dependence on Russian energy. Germany did more in a weekend to counter Russian revanchism than it has in the previous two decades—by reversing a ban on selling weapons to Ukraine, significantly increasing its defense spending to more than 2 percent of GDP, and announcing a $112 billion defense spending plan in the 2022 budget.

If all that remains insufficient to change Putin’s course, the only responsible choice is to do more, and to do it quickly: more sanctions, more military support, and more international unity.

There are two compelling reasons.

The first is humanitarian: Putin’s relentless attacks on Ukrainian civilians, prompting Europe’s biggest refugee crisis since World War II.

The second is the historic imperative: the need to reverse a global trajectory that could allow brutal authoritarianism, or bloody chaos, to shape the global future.

“Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has ended Americans’ 30-year holiday from history,” writes former US Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates in the Washington Post. “For the first time since World War II, the United States faces powerful, aggressive adversaries in Europe and Asia seeking to recover past glory along with claimed territories and spheres of influence. All in defiance of an international order largely shaped by the United States that has kept the peace among great powers for seven decades. The Russian and Chinese challenge to this peaceful order has been developing for a number of years. Putin’s war has provided the cold shower needed to awaken democratic governments to the reality of a new world, a world in which our recent strategy — including the ‘pivot’ to Asia — is woefully insufficient to meet the long-term challenges we face.”

It is clarifying and galvanizing to view Putin’s war on Ukraine in these terms: not as a dangerous episode, but as an epochal challenge.

With that in mind, what should be done?

The Atlantic Council’s Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security provided some actionable ideas through a survey of thirty-seven leading national-security experts. They assessed the options by weighing the positive benefits of each against its risk of escalation.

The best of the lot included: sending more of the armed drones that Ukrainians are already using so successfully; providing “off-the-shelf” electronic-warfare capability, including satellite-navigation and communications-jamming equipment, to enhance Ukraine’s ability to disrupt and slow Putin’s advance; and enhancing Ukraine’s critical short-range air-defense capabilities by providing more ground-based, close-in weapons systems to better defend against Russian aircraft and missile attacks.

Beyond that, I also favor a partial no-fly zone over the westernmost regions of Ukraine, close to the Polish, Slovakian, Hungarian, and Romanian borders. One can understand why the United States and NATO reject a no-fly zone over the whole of Ukraine; but in western Ukraine, it is a humanitarian imperative and also militarily easier, as it’s closer to western air bases. It would demonstrate our resolve to Putin.



At the same time, the United States, Europe, and their global partners should add to the impressive array of sanctions against Russia.

Their impact thus far, according to the Council’s Brian O’Toole and Daniel Fried, “has been to flatten the Russian financial system, crash the ruble, spur a likely sovereign default, and probably move the Russian economy into a depression.”

Yet as Putin’s forces continue their attack, O’Toole and Fried provide a menu (in ascending order of impact) of potential next steps: expanding the sanctions against Putin’s cronies and subordinates; extending sanctions on more banks and key companies (they suggest Gazprombank, Russian Agricultural Bank, AlfaBank, Sovcomflot, Russian Railways, and the diamond company Alrosa); and blocking the Russian government by sanctioning all Russia-state-owned companies. And if all else fails, enacting a full financial embargo that would ban all transactions, exports, and imports with Russia.

What’s not in doubt is that Putin will continue to escalate if more isn’t done to stop him.

“I think Putin is angry and frustrated right now,” CIA Director William Burns told the House Intelligence Committee last week. “He’s likely to double down and try to grind down the Ukrainian military with no regard for civilian casualties.”

Putin has lost: He will never be able to entirely pacify and occupy Ukraine, and he has done generational damage to the Russia whose power and prestige he was once determined to build. However, his opponents have not won: Saving Ukraine, and sustaining their newfound common cause, is the key to shaping the global future.

What has been accomplished against Putin thus far is remarkable, but it is still insufficient.

#1 In the Rubble of Kharkiv, Survivors Make Their Stand: ‘It’s a War, and its a Dirty War’

Yaroslav Trofimov | THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

Yaroslav Trofimov’s heartbreaking, powerful reporting from Kharkiv underscores the brutality of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, as Putin—frustrated and humiliated by the failure of his army to secure a swift victory—turns increasingly to the same brutal tactics he employed in Chechnya.

“Burned-out, shrapnel-peppered cars, the remains of their occupants melted into the seats, dot the streets,” Trofimov writes. “Twisted pieces of roofing hang from electricity lines. Inside the regional administration’s courtyard, a giant crater marked the spot where a Russian missile vaporized an ambulance.”

Elsewhere, he writes of tragic and courageous men and women thrust into extraordinary circumstances—from a neurosurgeon who has barely left the hospital for days, to a seven-year-old drawing pictures of his poodle on the wall of a subway station-turned-bomb shelter.

Trofimov concludes with a quote from Kharkiv’s mayor, summarizing the desperation and courage of the situation: “We will never surrender,” he said. “But now, the main task is to make sure our people stay alive.” Read more →

#2 The Stalinization of Russia

THE ECONOMIST

Putin, The Economist writes, is re-Stalinizing Russia with an extraordinary brutality as he doubles down on the gigantic mistake he made in invading Ukraine.

“The truth,” it argues, “is sinking in that, by attacking Ukraine, Mr Putin has committed a catastrophic error. He has wrecked the reputation of Russia’s supposedly formidable armed forces, which have proved tactically inept against a smaller, worse-armed but motivated opponent.”

And now, like Stalin, “Mr Putin is destroying the bourgeoisie, the great motor of Russia’s modernisation.” But unlike the Soviet dictator, the newspaper continues, Putin has neither a growing economy from which to draw, a vicious foreign invader against which to unite the country, nor even a coherent ideology.

Still, it cautions, “However much the West would like a new regime in Moscow, it must state that it will not directly engineer one. Liberation is a task for the Russian people.” Read more →

#3 The rising costs of China’s friendship with Russia

Tom Mitchell, Demetri Sevastopulo, Sun Yu, and James Kynge | FINANCIAL TIMES

To understand the position in which Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has placed China, read this smart, well-reported Financial Times analysis.

It finds that “as Russia has intensified its bombardment of urban areas, [Chinese President Xi Jinping] has found himself facing the potential for two interlocking crises. As the biggest importer of oil and a big buyer of food from around the world, China’s economy is very exposed to the market turmoil that the war and subsequent sanctions have unleashed. It also risks a deep diplomatic backlash, especially in Europe, where many see it as little short of an accomplice to the invasion.”

Yet Putin and Xi—“the tsar and the emperor,” according to Moscow-based analyst Alexander Gabuev—are personally close. In the words of China expert Sheena Greitens, it means that “even if some Chinese officials did want to recalibrate relations with Russia, they would struggle precisely because Xi has put a ‘very personal stamp’ on Sino-Russian relations.” Read more →

#4 The West’s Economic War Plan Against Putin

Tunku Varadarajan | THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

The Journal’s Weekend Interview by Tunku Varadarajan, who spoke with Atlantic Council nonresident senior fellow Edward Fishman, is a worthwhile read about how Vladimir Putin—who thought he had sanction-proofed himself—had instead left himself vulnerable. Those sanctions included measures against the Central Bank of Russia, which Fishman described as “the largest entity ever targeted by sanctions in history.”

His take on the sanctions against Russia is a fascinating one. He argues that they were only made possible by a European consensus and were well-prepared in advance as Putin’s invasion plans unfolded like “a slow-moving train wreck.”

Still, Fishman doesn’t believe the measures will make the Russian leader change his mind. “The best hope was to stop Mr. Putin before he made the decision to invade,” Varadarajan writes. “Now it’s time to turn to the longer-term goal of sanctions—economic and technological attrition, which is also more practical than any attempt to reshape Mr. Putin into a more conciliatory invader.” Read more →

#5 The West Has Declared Financial War on Russia. Is it Prepared for the Consequences?

Julia Friedlander | POLITICO

“Every morning since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, when markets open,” writes the Atlantic Council’s Julia Friedlander, “analysts watch two things simultaneously: the advance of Russian troops on one screen and the value of the ruble on the other, two battle fronts in the same confrontation.”

Friedlander provides the best stand-back analysis I’ve read about the unprecedented use of sanctions “to change military strategy in a war that is already happening.” She writes: “Never have sanctions played out like they are right now, a high-stakes gamble over European security, in real time, through financial and economic means. The moves are all the more surprising given that the Biden administration telegraphed a more restrained approach to sanctions when it first came into office.” Read more →

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

The latest developments on the Russia-Ukraine war:

UNITED NATIONS - The United Nations chief warned Monday that Russia’s war on Ukraine is holding “a sword of Damocles” over the global economy, especially poor developing countries that face skyrocketing food, fuel and fertilizer prices and are now seeing their breadbasket “being bombed.”

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters that “Russia and Ukraine represent more than half of the world’s supply of sunflower oil and about 30 percent of the world’s wheat” and that “grain prices have already exceeded those at the start of the Arab Spring and the food riots of 2007-2008.”

He told reporters that 45 African and least developed countries import at least one-third of their wheat from Ukraine and Russia, and 18 of them import at least 50%. These countries include Egypt, Congo, Burkina Faso, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, he said.

“All of this is hitting the poorest the hardest and planting the seeds for political instability and unrest around the globe,” Guterres warned.

SEOUL, South Korea –Korean Air says it will suspend passenger and cargo flights to Moscow and Vladivostok at least through late April, citing concerns about airport operation and safety amid Russia’s war with Ukraine.

The South Korean airline also said it will also reroute cargo flights to Western Europe that had transited through Moscow so that they would pass through China, Kazakhstan and Turkey instead.

The airline has also been avoiding Russian and Ukrainian airspace on its flights to East Coast U.S. cities.

KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says that talks between Ukrainian and Russian delegations will continue Tuesday.

Speaking in a video address, Zelenskyy said that the Ukrainian delegation did good work during Monday’s talks. He didn’t provide further details.

He said he spoke Monday to Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett as part of efforts to “quickly end the war” and achieve “honest peace.” Bennett, who has sought to mediate a peaceful settlement, also spoke Monday to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Zelenskyy hailed a Russian state TV employee who interrupted the main evening news program on Russian Channel 1 by running into a studio with a poster against the war in Ukraine. The employee was later arrested by police.

The Ukrainian president again addressed the Russian soldiers, urging them to stop fighting and saying: “I’m offering you a chance to survive.”

In a bid to shore up the economy badly battered by the war, Zelenskyy announced a plan to sharply reduce taxes for business.

LVIV, Ukraine — The Ukrainian military says it has repelled a Russian attempt to take control of the strategic port of Mariupol.

The Ukrainian military’s General Staff said in a statement that Russian forces retreated after suffering losses.

The Russian military has besieged the Azov Sea port city of 430,000 for a week and a half, leaving its residents desperate for power, water and food. More than 2,500 residents of Mariupol have been killed by the Russian shelling.

Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in televised remarks that Russian shelling on Monday thwarted another attempt to deliver food and medicines to the city.

A humanitarian convoy of 160 civilian cars left Mariupol after repeated failures to evacuate civilians because of Russian shelling.

The fate of hundreds of planes leased by Russian airlines from foreign companies grew murkier Monday after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law letting the airlines register those planes and continue flying them.

Russian state media said the law will let Russian airlines keep their fleets and operate foreign planes on routes within Russia.

Many of the planes used by Russian airlines are leased from foreign companies, including several in Ireland, a member of the European Union. Last month, the EU banned the sale or leasing of planes to Russia as part of sanctions to punish Russia for invading Ukraine. It gave leasing companies until March 28 to end current contracts in Russia.

Last week, Russia’s air-transport agency advised airlines with foreign-registered planes not to take them out of the country because of the risk they could be repossessed.

Various estimates place the number of foreign-owned planes operated by Russian airlines at around 500 or more, and the vast majority of them were inside Russia when the war started Feb. 24. Aviation consulting firm Ishka estimates that the foreign-owned planes are worth $12 billion, nearly half of that by Irish-based lessors.

BRUSSELS — The European Union announced late Monday that the 27-nation bloc has approved a fourth set of sanctions to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine.

France, which holds the EU presidency, said in a statement that the bloc approved a package targeting “individuals and entities involved in the aggression against Ukraine,” along with sectors of the Russian economy.

The exact details of the latest package will be revealed in the EU’s official journal.

Since the war started last month, the EU has adopted tough measures targeting Russian President Vladimir Putin, Russia’s financial system and the country’s oligarchs. Last week, the bloc agreed to slap further sanctions on 160 individuals and added new restrictions on the export of maritime navigation and radio communication technology.

MADRID — Spain’s prime minister says that authorities in the northeastern city of Barcelona have “immobilized” an 85-meter (279-foot) superyacht valued at 140 million euros ($153 million) while links to a prominent Russian armament tycoon are investigated.

The boat, named Valerie, has been moored at an exclusive shipyard in the port.

The yacht is connected through an intricate network of shell companies to Sergei Chemezov, the head of the Rostec state defense conglomerate, according to a consortium of journalists that last year investigated the so-called Pandora Papers involving the murky financial deals of the world’s richest people.

Chemezov is a former KGB agent who has long been close to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The European Union last week included him in a list of sanctioned individuals over Moscow’s war on Ukraine.

“Today we have temporarily immobilized a yacht of one of Russia’s most prominent oligarchs, and there will be more to come,” Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said late Monday during an interview in LaSexta television.

NEW YORK — Russia’s war against Ukraine is threatening the global food supply and putting developing countries, especially the world’s poorest, at risk, the United Nations chief and the head of the U.N. food agency warned on Monday.

More than 40 African and least-developed countries import at least one-third of their wheat from Ukraine and Russia, and 18 of them import at least 50%, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters. These countries include Egypt, Congo, Burkina Faso, Leban, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, he said.

“All of this is hitting the poorest the hardest and planting the seeds for political instability and unrest around the globe,” the secretary-general warned.

David Beasley, executive director of the World Food Program, told The Associated Press during a visit to the Ukrainian city of Lviv that 50% of the grain the program buys to feed “the 125 million people we reach on any given day, week or month” comes from Ukraine, as does 20% of the world’s supply of corn.

“So (the war) is going to have a dynamic global catastrophic impact,” Beasley said.

Guterres announced an additional $40 million from the U.N.’s emergency fund to get critical supplies of food, water and medicine into Ukraine, where at least 1.9 million people are displaced.

JERUSALEM — Israel plans to set up a field hospital to provide medical treatment for refugees in western Ukraine, officials said Monday.

The project is spearheaded by the country’s foreign and health ministries, according to a statement from Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett’s office. The hospital should be operational by next week, the foreign ministry said.

“It’s an initiative that not many countries can take upon themselves, and Israel has this ability and we are going forward,” Bennett said.

The Foreign Ministry said the hospital will operate for month, providing refugees with an emergency room, a delivery room, and other services.

It has dubbed the operation Kochav Meir — Hebrew for “Shining Star” — after the country’s first female prime minister, Golda Meir, who was born in Ukraine and founded the Foreign Ministry’s international development unit.

Israel has good relations with both Ukraine and Russia and has worked as an intermediary between the two countries since Russia invaded on Feb. 24. In recent days, however, Foreign Minister Yair Lapid has become increasingly outspoken in his condemnations of Russia’s invasion of its western neighbor.

MOSCOW — The Kremlin says that President Vladimir Putin has had another call with Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett to talk about Ukraine.

Bennett told Putin about his contacts with other heads of states, and Putin shared his assessments of talks between Russian and Ukrainian representatives via video calls, the Kremlin said in a statement.

A senior Israeli official said Bennett’s conversation with Putin lasted 90 minutes, with discussions focusing on cease-fire talks and humanitarian issues. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss diplomatic matters. Bennett’s office later said that the prime minister also spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday. It did not elaborate.

Bennett has visited Moscow for talks and has had numerous phone calls with Putin, Zelenskyy and Western leaders as he seeks to mediate an end to the war in Ukraine.

Israel is one of the few countries to have good working relations with both Russia and Ukraine, though in recent days Foreign Minister Yair Lapid has become increasingly outspoken in his condemnations of Russia’s invasion of its western neighbor.

WASHINGTON — The Russian military was largely stalled in its attempted advance in Ukraine on Monday and made little progress over the weekend, a senior U.S. defense official said.

The official also said the Russians have not taken total control of the airspace. The official said all of the Russian military forces that had been arrayed around the country are now inside, and that the Russians still retain about 90% of their combat capabilities. The official said there are no indications the Russians are trying to bring in reinforcements.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military assessments.

The official also said the U.S. has not done any training of the Ukrainian military in the country since the Florida National Guard forces left as the war was beginning. And the official said a military training base the Russians hit in western Ukraine on Sunday close to the Polish border wasn’t being used as a shipment site for U.S. military supplies to Ukraine.

MOSCOW — The Russian military says it will carry out strikes to knock out Ukrainian military industries.

Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Monday that the Russian forces will “take measures to incapacitate enterprises of Ukraine’s military-industrial complex involved in production and maintenance and repair of weapons.”

He urged workers of those plants and residents of nearby areas to leave “potentially dangerous zones.”

Konashenkov’s statement came hours after Ukrainian authorities said two people were killed when the Russian forces struck the Antonov aircraft-making plant on the outskirts of Kyiv, sparking a large fire.

The Russian military also said that it will continue to target any foreign fighters who have come to Ukraine.

Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said that the Russian forces will show “no mercy for mercenaries wherever they are in the territory of Ukraine.”

WASHINGTON — The White House is weighing the possibility of President Joe Biden traveling to Europe in the coming weeks for face-to-face talks with European leaders about the Russian invasion of Ukraine, according to three U.S. officials familiar with the deliberations.

The prospective trip is yet to be finalized. One possible destination for the meetings would be Brussels, which is the headquarters for NATO, one of the officials said Monday. Another official said the White House was looking at Biden visiting NATO headquarters on March 24, with other potential stops in Europe.

All of the officials spoke on the condition of anonymity as none was allowed to comment publicly.

Biden’s potential trip would follow Vice President Kamala Harris’ visit to the eastern flank NATO countries of Poland and Romania last week to discuss with leaders there the growing refugee crisis in eastern Europe sparked by the Russian invasion. The trip would underscore the Biden administration’s support for NATO allies. NBC News first reported that the discussions for a potential Biden trip are underway.

KYIV, Ukraine — A Russian rocket attack on a television tower in the western village of Antopol on Monday morning killed nine people, according to the governor of the Rivne region. The village is only about 160 kilometers (100 miles) from the border of NATO member Poland.

The attack came just a day after Russian missiles pounded a military training base in western Ukraine, close to the Polish border, killing 35 people. That attack raised fears that NATO could be drawn into direct conflict with Russia.

The base had served previously as a crucial hub for cooperation between Ukraine and NATO.

The senior U.S. defense official said the base was not being used at the time as a shipment site for U.S. military supplies to Ukraine.

Ukrainian authorities also said two people died and seven were injured after Russian forces struck an airplane factory in the capital of Kyiv, and that two people were killed in the northern Obolonskyi district of the capital when Russian artillery fire hit a nine-story apartment building. They said a Russian airstrike in the capital’s downtown area Monday killed one person and wounded six others.

The United Nations has recorded at least 596 civilian deaths since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, though it believes the true toll is much higher.

ANKARA, Turkey — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz says there can only be a diplomatic solution to the conflict in Ukraine and called on Russia to immediately stop its attacks on the country.

Scholz said Monday during a visit to Turkey that “with each day, with each bomb, Russia is moving further away from the international community.”

Speaking after a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Scholz praised Turkey for closing the Bosphorus to warships from parties to the conflict in Ukraine. The move mainly affects Russia’s access to the Mediterranean from the Black Sea.

BELGRADE, Serbia — A flight from Belgrade to Moscow turned back Monday following the second false bomb threat in four days, Serbian police said.

The Belgrade airport received an email saying that an explosive device had been planted on the AirSerbia flight to Moscow, police said in a statement. The same happened last Friday.

The plane was turned back shortly after takeoff, and after being checked by police, the alarm turned out to be false, the statement said.

Besides some Turkish carriers, Serbia’s national airline AirSerbia is the only airline in Europe still flying to and from Russia. Serbia, which formally seeks European Union membership but has maintained close relations with ally Russia, has refused to join an EU-imposed flight ban in response to the war in Ukraine.

MADRID — Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares said Monday that he has asked his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi to use Beijing’s influence over Moscow to end the war in Ukraine.

“We are at a historical moment that requires responsibility and vision of all world leaders,” Albares told Wang during a telephone conversation on Monday, according to a statement from the ministry.

It said that Albares condemned “the Russian aggression on Ukraine” by telling Wang that “Russia has undermined the foundations of peace and stability in Europe and threatens the international community.”

VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis says the war in Ukraine shows that those in power have not learned from the harsh lessons of previous wars over the past century.

The Vatican has responded to the Russian invasion by sending a cardinal to visit refugees. The cardinal visited last week with some of those who have taken refuge in Hungary. He is scheduled to visit with others in Slovakia on Wednesday before heading to Ukraine, the Holy See said.

In a speech at the Vatican on Monday, the pope said regional wars, especially that in Ukraine, demonstrate that “those who rule the destinies of peoples still haven’t absorbed the lessons of the tragedies of the 20th century.”

A day earlier, in his strongest condemnation yet of the war, the pontiff said no strategic reason could justify Russia’s attack on Ukraine.

PRISTINA, Kosovo — A European Union mission that helps maintain security and enforce the rule of law in Kosovo is beefing up its police forces in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, officials said Monday.

A reserve unit of 92 members of the European Gendarmerie Force from Portugal, France and Italy will temporarily deploy to Kosovo in the coming weeks, EULEX said in a statement. An advance team was expected to arrive Monday.

In terms of providing security and enforcing the rule of law, EULEX’s police represent a second line of defense after Kosovo police. The NATO-led KFOR serves as a third line of defense.

“Russia’s invasion in Ukraine puts everything in a different light,” said EULEX spokesperson Ioanna Lachana. Lachana added that the “security situation in Kosovo remains stable.”

The 1998-1999 war in Kosovo, then a Serbian province, ended after a NATO military intervention that forced Serbia to withdraw its forces. The United Nations administered the territory for nine years before Kosovo declared independence in 2008, a move that Serbia doesn’t recognize.

UNITED NATIONS — Poland’s foreign minister is accusing Russia of “state terrorism” for targeting civilians, schools, hospitals and other civilian infrastructure “in an attempt to break the spirit of the Ukrainian people.”

Zbigniew Rau told the U.N. Security Council Monday that Russia’s “unprovoked, unjustified and premeditated aggression” against Ukraine was “poorly prepared and executed (and) turned out to be a strategic and tactical failure.”

“But instead of preventing further unnecessary deaths in its own ranks, the Kremlin changed its tactics,” he said. “The invading force started to target the civilian population and infrastructure” in violation of the Geneva Conventions and international humanitarian law to try to break the Ukrainian resistance.

Rau addressed the Security Council’s annual meeting with the Organization for Security and Cooperation as the OSCE’s rotating chair.

SKOPJE, North Macedonia — The European Union’s foreign policy chief says the 27-country bloc is finalizing its new round of sanctions against Russia for its “barbaric” invasion of Ukraine.

Josep Borrell said Monday that the fourth package of coercive measures would target Russia’s market access, membership in international financial institutions, and steel and energy sectors.

“We are listing more companies and individuals playing an active role in supporting the people who undermine Ukrainian sovereignty,” Borrell said, after talks in Skopje on Monday with North Macedonia’s Prime Minister Dimitar Kovachevski. “This would be another major blow (to the) economic and logistic base upon which the Kremlin is building the invasion.”

LVIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said talks with Russia concluded for the day Monday but will resume on Tuesday.

The negotiations, which took place by video conference, were the fourth round involving higher-level officials from the two countries and the first held in a week. Previous discussions, held in person in Belarus, did not produce lasting humanitarian routes or agreements to end the fighting in Ukraine.

“A technical pause has been taken in the negotiations until tomorrow,” Podolyak wrote on Twitter. “Negotiations continue.”

He said earlier that “communication is being held, yet it’s hard.”

COPENHAGEN, Denmark — A planned NATO exercise with about 30,000 troops from more than 25 countries from Europe and North America began in northern Norway on Monday.

NATO said that the drill, named Cold Response that includes 200 aircraft and 50 vessels, was “not linked to Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine.”

The drill in NATO-member Norway, which shares a nearly 200-kilometer (124-mile) land border with Russia, will be held just a few hundred kilometers from the Russian border and was planned long before Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

WASHINGTON — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will deliver an address via video to the U.S. Congress as the Russian war on his country intensifies.

Zelenskyy will speak on Wednesday to members of the House and Senate, the Democratic leaders announced.

“The Congress, our country and the world are in awe of the people of Ukraine,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in a statement Monday.

Congress recently approved $13.6 billion in emergency military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine.

“We look forward to the privilege of welcoming President Zelenskyy’s address to the House and Senate and to convey our support to the people of Ukraine as they bravely defend democracy,” the leaders said.

MOSCOW -- Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday denied media reports alleging that Russia asked China for military assistance to help advance its offensive in Ukraine.

“No, Russia has its own potential to continue the operation, which, as we have said, is unfolding in accordance with the plan and will be completed on time and in full,” Peskov told his daily conference call with reporters.

Peskov also stressed that the operation in Ukraine was going as planned and that the Russian military were ensuring “the maximum security of the civilian population.”

He said that at the “beginning of the operation” that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered the military to refrain from “the immediate storming” of large cities including Kyiv because “armed nationalist formations set up firing points, place heavy military equipment directly in residential areas, and fighting in densely populated areas will inevitably lead to multiple casualties among civilians.”

He added that “at the same time, the Defense Ministry, while ensuring the maximum security of the civilian population, does not rule out the possibility of taking full control of large settlements that are now practically surrounded, expect for areas used for humanitarian evacuation.”

MOSCOW — The Russian military says that 20 civilians have been killed by a ballistic missile launched by the Ukrainian forces.

Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said that the Soviet-made Tochka-U missile on Monday hit the central part of the eastern city of Donetsk, the center of the separatist Donetsk region.

He said that another 28 civilians, including children, were seriously wounded by the missile that carried shrapnel warhead.

Konashenkov said the missile was fired from an area northwest of Donetsk controlled by Ukrainian forces. He charged that the shelling of the area of Donetsk that has no military facilities represented a war crime.

Konashenkov’s claim couldn’t be independently verified.

WARSAW, Poland -- Activists in Poland have been blocking Russian and Belarusian trucks in an effort to prevent them from crossing the Belarusian border with medicines, food and spare parts for the Russian military.

Belarus is allied with Russia. Activists fear that the goods will help reinforce the Russian military as it intensifies its war against Ukraine.

Tomasz Grodzki, the speaker of the opposition-controlled Senate, criticized Poland’s right-wing government for allowing the trucks to continue to cross Poland into Belarus.

“I am disgusted by the lack of sanctions by our government,” Grodzki said, in comments carried by the Polish news agency PAP on Monday.

However, a ruling party spokesman, Radoslaw Fogiel, said Poland was expecting the European Union to close off the transport to Russia and Belarus.

LVIV, Ukraine -- The Ukrainian state power company says the power line supplying the site of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster has been damaged by Russian forces again after it was repaired.

The Ukrenergo company said in a statement Monday that its technicians had started to supply power Sunday evening but “before the power supply was fully restored, the occupying forces damaged it again.” Ukrenergo said it will attempt another repair.

The power is used to feed pumps and other equipment which keep spent nuclear fuel at the former power plant cool to prevent radiation leaks.

The Chernobyl site is also equipped with diesel generators, and Belarusian authorities said last week that they had set up an emergency power supply from the nearby border.

The International Atomic Energy Agency has played down concerns over the safety of nuclear waste at Chernobyl, saying that cooling ponds there are large enough to keep the spent fuel in a safe condition even if the power supply is interrupted.",https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-560b945c4edc21311d96ee6035d7e849
70,f5ae3391-f369-4a77-b2a0-f3bf1322258e,['Patrick Wintour'],2022-03-14 00:00:00,"Allies of the Ukrainian president, Voldymyr Zelenskiy, say Vladimir Putin will only accept a compromise on Ukraine’s future neutrality if he is facing a credible threat to his economic power base by a rapid and permanent exclusion of Russia’s oil and gas exports from its lucrative European markets. The Russian government receives 40% of its budget revenues from energy exports.

But Ukraine is meeting stubborn resistance from Germany, which insists its economy would be plunged into recession if it suddenly lost access to Russian gas and oil.

In an interview reflecting the moral pressure Germany is under to do more, the country’s Green economics minister, Robert Habeck, admitted Europe in the past had fed Ukraine false promises, but said Germany could not afford “the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs” that a full energy embargo would require. He said Germany at best could be freed of Russian coal by the autumn, of its oil by the end of the year, but could set no date for ending German reliance on gas.

The impasse is leaving senior allies of Zelenskiy feeling frustrated, and appealing to the UK and the US to use the G7 to try to persuade the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, to sign up to a western timetable to end dependence on Russian energy.

Scholz and Emmanuel Macron, the French president, spoke with Putin again at the weekend. Zelenskiy’s chief negotiator, Mykhailo Podolyak, has said the talks between Ukraine and Russia are now virtually continuous, and have got past the stage of trading ultimatums. But the French sound less optimistic. Jean-Yves Le Drian, the French foreign minister, said: “We are in front of a wall. The worst is ahead of us. This war will be long.”

The frustration with the German position is such that Zelenskiy is willing to turn to one of Scholz’s predecessors, Gerhard Schröder, to act as a mediator with Putin. The former chancellor has accepted the role, possibly to salvage something from the ruins of his reputation, and reportedly had talks with Putin last week.

Some of Zelenskiy’s team are also uneasy at the intermediary role of the Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, questioning the depth of Israel’s support.

Zelenskiy has repeatedly stressed he is willing to meet Putin to discuss new security guarantees for Ukraine in return for his country’s future neutrality, either as an alternative to membership of Nato, or as an interim measure prior to joining the defence pact.

‘The hostile bacchanalia’

Speaking last week after his largely inconclusive talks with Sergei Lavrov in Turkey, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dymtro Kubela, said “the real issue for Ukraine is security guarantees and hard security guarantees, similar to the ones that members of Nato have. We need these guarantees primarily from Russia since it is the country that committed an act of aggression against us, but also from other countries including permanent members of the UN security council. The idea is that we have a treaty, an agreement where countries would oblige themselves not to commit aggression or put economic, or any other, pressure on us”.

He confirmed the president had cooled down on Ukraine’s Nato application “because, despite our best efforts, Nato is not ready to integrate us. The reaction to the aggression by Nato has been to delegate to member states to deal with us on a bilateral basis.” But he added that until Ukraine knew the strength and reliability of the guarantees it was not yet ready to say the guarantees could be a substitute for Nato membership. “We are not yet in a position to abandon Nato membership”, he said.

The idea is for a legally binding treaty signed by numerous countries that guarantees the security of Ukraine in a way that the Budapest Memorandum signed in 1994 failed to do. The memorandum was supposed to guarantee Ukraine’s independence in return for the country abandoning its nuclear stockpile. Britain, in the form of John Major, was one of the co-signatories. The memorandum in effect became a dead letter. Zelenskiy insists the talks are serious and no longer merely an exchange of ultimatums.

The US, reflecting what it has been briefed to them by Israeli, French and Turkish intermediaries, all whom have spoken to Putin, say they have not heard any willingness by the Russian leader to compromise.

“It’s hard to offer an overture when the Kremlin’s position continues to be that we’ll continue to pummel Ukraine until it bows to maximalist demands,” a senior US official said last week. Putin’s public position is still to demand the “demilitarisation and de-nazification” of Ukraine, in effect regime change, as well as Ukrainian recognition of Crimea and of the Donbas. He thinks he is winning, the White House judges.

That leads the US and UK to argue the economic endurance test between the west and Russia must continue, and be intensified, until what Putin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov oddly describes as “the hostile bacchanalia” becomes so intense that Putin finds his inner circle desert him, or even assassinate him.

But Zelenskiy’s allies feel Scholz, a fortnight after Germany’s great “turning point” on defence spending, has reverted to cautious type. A delegation has been in Europe this week arguing the EU, now on its fourth sanction package, has still not taken the decisive step – a total embargo on Russian energy.

Andriy Kobolyev, the former boss of Ukraine’s energy firm Naftogaz, and now spearheading an international push for comprehensive western energy sanctions on behalf of Zelenskiy, finds the German caution frustrating.

He said: “Until European leaders understand Putin sees them as a weak and easy victims in his geopolitical strategy, he will continue doing what he is doing. That is why the only way to prove Putin wrong is to put on a full-scale energy embargo. Europe has to play a different game and say ‘we know we can cope without Russia’. It has to say ‘we are large economies, and with a different energy mix we can cope because for us it is a matter of principle’. It has to say ‘we are putting an end to this right now and you Russians will lose our market forever’. That poses an existential threat for Russia.”

Putin’s ‘sacred cash cow’

Kobolyev has negotiated with Putin and his energy barons, and insists he knows their mindset. He believes the Russian president will face their wrath, and that of the FSB security service, if they feel Putin totally miscalculated not only Ukrainian resistance, but the west’s willingness to make the sacrifices to wean themselves off Russian energy, and so blow a massive long-term hole in the Russian budget.

It would also upend all the assumptions of the Russian energy elite around Putin, such as Igor Sechin, the boss of Rosneft. Sechin, like Putin, is highly conservative on issues such as climate change. He remains convinced absolute oil consumption will increase by 10% by 2040 and by 20% in Asia. Kobolyev says it would be a complete shock to Sechin if his most profitable market just disappeared overnight. “Their sacred cash cow would have been killed.”

So far only the US has said it will end oil imports, but since the US imported an average of only 209,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and 500,000 bpd of other petroleum products from Russia in 2021, it is hardly a great sacrifice. The UK has said it will join the embargo by the end of the year.

But Scholz has set his face against the move. He said last week: “At the moment, Europe’s supply of energy for heat generation, mobility, power supply and industry cannot be secured in any other way. It is therefore of essential importance for the provision of public services and the daily lives of our citizens,” he added.

Annalena Baerbock, the Green foreign minister, has said much the same. “If we end up in a situation where nurses and teachers are not coming to work, where we have no electricity for several days. Putin will have won part of the battle, because he will have plunged other countries into chaos.” Scholz was one of a group of leaders who insisted on the removal in an EU council statement of any reference to the proposed target date of 2027 for the EU to end its dependence on Russian gas.

A game of geopolitical chess

His concern is understandable. Oil accounts for 32% of German energy input, and one-third of that comes from Russia.

Yet oil is central to Putin’s war machine. Thane Gustafson, the chronicler of Russia’s energy sector, points out in his latest book, Klimat, that in 2019, the last pre-pandemic year, income from oil – worth $188bn – accounted for 44% of Russian exports in value, and gas only 12%. Hydrocarbons generate 56% of Russia’s export income and 39% of the federal budget.

Kobolyev is convinced that if the EU banned Russian oil, other sources could be found. “There is a Russian proverb: a sacred place is never empty for long”, he explains.

In a game of geopolitical chess with Russia, Biden is already working to find alternative oil supplies. For now he is trying to fill the shortfall through drawing on the US reserves, oil from Venezuela, the world largest oil producer, Iran and Saudi Arabia.

White House officials were in Caracas for the first such talks in 20 years. Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro government has signalled its willingness to cooperate with the White House by releasing two political prisoners in a goodwill gesture. Venezuela’s oil output could rise by at least 400,000 bpd, the country’s petroleum chamber said on Friday. But Biden has to tread carefully since the idea of reconciliation with Maduro is leading to a reaction in Congress.

Difficult talks about Saudi Arabia boosting output are continuing, according to Kobolyev. But Saudi’s weekend execution of 81 “criminals and terrorists” hardly suggests the kingdom is desperately seeking the west’s approval. The executions hardly makes a mooted visit to Riyadh by Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, more likely.

In the case of Iran, Russia has stepped in at the last minute to try to block Iran’s nuclear deal, fearing that an agreement, and the lifting of oil sanctions on Iran, would result in Tehran being able to unleash as much as 2m barrels of oil a day on to the global market.

To turn to the autocrats of Venezuela, Iran and to Saudi Arabia, or the indeed the UAE, to save the west from Putin has its ironies, but some say needs must. If Paris was worth a mass, oil, it seems, is seen as worth some diplomatic humble pie.

The more complex issue is gas. As a compromise between those that favour a ban, such as Poland and the Baltic states, the EU has produced a plan by which the EU cuts its consumption of Russian gas by two-thirds before the end of 2022. The EU would then become independent from all Russian fossil fuels by 2027 or “well before 2030”. “By the end of this year, we can replace 100bn cubic metres [bcm] of gas imports from Russia. That is two-thirds of what we import from them”, the EU commission said in a statement.

The EU argued it can receive about 10bcm more gas from alternative pipeline suppliers such as Norway and Azerbaijan. The main bulk of this replacement would, however, come from imported liquid natural gas, which officials estimate would need to reach 50bcm of additional imports by the end of 2022, possibly via a joint, strategic EU contract, although legal details remain to be resolved. Federico Santi, a gas specialist at the consultancy Eurasia Group, said: “That is a huge figure, equivalent to around 10% of global LNG consumption in 2021.”

Even so, Kobolyev is unimpressed by the lack of ambition and the lack of specific measures.

He insists the EU should at least cut off sales of Russian LNG, which hits the Yamal project, with ties to the Kremlin’s siloviki mafia. He has also proposed that the revenues from Gazprom’s pipelines go into an Iran-style escrow account that will be released only once Russia calls off the invasion. Sums might be deducted to pay for the reconstruction of Ukraine. He claims Russia could not physically turn off the gas taps immediately, taking Europe through to next winter.

The Russians and Putin have always believed Europe can never survive without Russian oil

Kobolyev is no longer a lonely voice, but is finding influential support in Germany in a way that is starting to discomfort the “traffic light-coalition” government. Norbert Rottgen the CDU former chair of the Bundestag foreign affairs committee, is calling for a full ban, and says he is not sure what happened to Germany’s turning point. He says polls show voters are ahead of their leaders in being prepared to make economic sacrifices to stop funding Putin’s war machine.

On 8 March, the Leopoldina National Academy of Science, and separately a group of nine international economists, mapped out how Germany could absorb an embargo, with the worst scenario a 3% fall in GDP – less than 4% impact of Covid – or probably something like a cost of €1,200 per German citizen.

This figure is contested, including by Habeck, who says the impact is more likely to be 5%. Various economists, lobbyists and gas intensive industries, such as chemicals, are staking out their ground in a heated debate that blends morality, politics and economic modelling.

Scholz has moved under pressure in this war once, over arms sales, Nord Stream 2 and defence spending, and there is no guarantee he will not again.

But if frozen out of European markets, would Putin simply turn to China? Kobolyev says no. “The option of shifting gas sales to Chinese markets is not possible,” he says. “In the case of China it might take 10 to 15 years to build the infrastructure. The existing pipeline to China is small and is not connected to the areas currently supplying Europe.

“Although exporting LNG and oil will be easier, China will know they are his last market, meaning he will lose 80% of his revenues and that is a devastating blow.”

“This is about more than cents and dollars. Putin is paranoid and he would hate to become dependent on China because he is afraid China will eat them alive. Russians perceive China as their smaller brother. Russians brought communism to China, but this will be a humiliation.

“So when Putin goes back to his crony friends – and this is the close KGB circle – and he tells them ‘Look guys, we have been thrown out of Europe completely, but I am trying to negotiate with China’, they are not going to appreciate that. To lose your biggest most lucrative market, to lose 80% of your revenues and become fully dependent on China, that does not look like a very smart or strategic move. That does not look like a victory.

“The Russians and Putin”, he explains, “have always believed Europe can never survive without Russian oil. He thinks if he wins in Ukraine, the Kremlin will be forgiven because there is no alternative and the west is weak. That is how he thinks, it’s how Gazprom thinks and it’s how Rosneft thinks. That is how they see the world. That is why Putin personally controls the energy trade. It is his sacred cash cow.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/west-putin-sacred-cash-cow-russia-ukraine-gas

72,f5ae3391-f369-4a77-b2a0-f3bf1322258e,['Ap'],,"WASHINGTON: More than two weeks into a war he expected to dominate in two days, Vladimir Putin is projecting anger, frustration at his military's failures, and a willingness to cause even more violence and destruction in Ukraine , in the assessment of US intelligence officials.Officials in recent days have publicly said they're worried the Russian president will escalate the conflict to try to break Ukraine's resistance. Russia still holds overwhelming military advantages and can bombard the country for weeks more. And while the rest of the world reacts to horrific images of the war he started, Putin remains insulated from domestic pressure by what CIA Director William Burns called a “propaganda bubble.”Putin's mindset — as tough as it is to determine from afar — is critical for the West to understand as it provides more military aid to Ukraine and also prevent Putin from directly taking on NATO countries or possibly reaching for the nuclear button.Intelligence officials over two days of testimony before Congress last week openly voiced concerns about what Putin might do. And those concerns increasingly shape discussions about what US policymakers are willing to do for Ukraine.Over two decades, Putin has achieved total dominance of Russia's government and security services, ruling with a tiny inner circle, marginalizing dissent, and jailing or killing his opposition.He has long criticized the breakup of the Soviet Union, dismissed Ukraine's claims to sovereignty, and mused about nuclear war ending with Russians as “martyrs.” Burns told lawmakers that he believed Putin was “stewing in a combustible combination of grievance and ambition for many years.”Putin had expected to seize Kyiv in two days, Burns said. Instead, his military has failed to take control of major cities and lost several thousand soldiers already.The West has imposed sanctions and other measures that have crippled the Russian economy and diminished living standards for oligarchs and ordinary citizens alike. Much of the foreign currency Russia had accumulated as a bulwark against sanctions is now frozen in banks abroad.Burns is a former US ambassador to Moscow who has met with Putin many times. He told lawmakers in response to a question about the Russian president's mental state that he did not believe Putin was crazy.“I think Putin is angry and frustrated right now,” he said. “He's likely to double down and try to grind down the Ukrainian military with no regard for civilian casualties.”Russia's recent unsupported claims that the US is helping Ukraine develop chemical or biological weapons suggest that Putin may himself be prepared to deploy those weapons in a “false flag” operation, Burns said.There's no apparent path to ending the war. It is nearly inconceivable that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy , who has won admiration around the world for leading his country's resistance, would suddenly recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea or support granting new autonomy to Russian-friendly parts of eastern Ukraine.And even if he captures Kyiv and deposes Zelenskyy, Putin would have to account for an insurgency supported by the West in a country of more than 40 million.“He has no sustainable political end-game in the face of what is going to continue to be fierce resistance from Ukrainians,” Burns said.Avril Haines, President Joe Biden's director of national intelligence, said Putin “perceives this as a war he cannot afford to lose. But what he might be willing to accept as a victory may change over time given the significant costs he is incurring.”Intelligence analysts think Putin's recent raising of Russia's nuclear alert level was “probably intended to deter the West from providing additional support to Ukraine,” she said.The White House's concern about escalation has at times frustrated both Democrats and Republicans. After initially signaling support, the Biden administration declined in recent days to support a Polish plan to donate Soviet-era warplanes to Ukraine that would have required the US to participate in the transfer.The administration previously delayed sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and would not send Stinger air-defense missiles to Ukraine before changing course.Questioned on Thursday, Haines said Putin might see the plane transfer as a bigger deal than the anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons already going to Ukraine. Haines did not disclose whether the U.S. had intelligence to support that finding.U.S. Rep. Mike Quigley, an Illinois Democrat who sits on the House Intelligence Committee, said the Biden administration had been “always a step or two late” out of fear of triggering Putin. He urged the White House to agree quickly to the transfer of planes.“I think it comes off as quibbling,” Quigley said. “If anyone thinks that Putin is going to distinguish and differentiate — Oh, well, they're taking off from Poland' — he sees all of this as escalatory.”Meanwhile, as the violence worsens and more Russians die, the West is also watching for any sign of holes forming in Putin's “propaganda bubble.” One independent Russian political analyst, Kirill Rogov, posted on his Telegram account that the war is “lost” and an “epic failure.”“The mistake was the notion that the West was unwilling to resist aggression, that it was lethargic, greedy and divided,” Rogov wrote. ""The idea that the Russian economy is self-sufficient and secure was a mistake.The mistake was the idea of ??the quality of the Russian army. And the main mistake was the idea that Ukraine is a failed state, and Ukrainians are not a nation.“Four mistakes in making one decision is a lot,” he said.Before the invasion, polling conducted by the Levada Center, Russia's top independent opinion research firm, found that 60% of respondents consider the U.S. and NATO the “initiators” of conflict in eastern Ukraine. Just 3% answered Russia.The polling was in January and February, and the Levada Center has not published new polling since the war began.Outsiders hope ordinary Russians will respond to the sharp decline in their living standards and find honest portrayals of the war through relatives and online, including by using VPN software to bypass Kremlin blocks on social media.Russian state television continues to air false or unsupported allegations about the U.S. and Ukrainian governments and push a narrative that Russia can't afford to lose the war.“Otherwise, it will lead to the death of Russia itself,” said Vladimir Solovyov , host of a prime-time talk show on state TV channel Russia 1, on his daily radio show last week.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/us-view-of-putin-angry-frustrated-likely-to-escalate-war/articleshow/90194957.cms
73,c5e6a703-1a8d-4f19-a53f-77b65e3cea50,['Stefan Becket'],,"Washington — An American journalist was killed and another was wounded by Russian forces in the town of Irpin outside the capital of Kyiv as they were traveling to film refugees, Ukrainian police said Sunday.

Brent Renaud, a 50-year-old filmmaker, was killed when Russian troops opened fire, according to Andriy Nebytov, the head of Kyiv's regional police force. Nebytov posted a graphic photo purportedly of Renaud's body on Facebook, as well as pictures of his American passport and media credentials issued by The New York Times.

A spokeswoman for the Times said Renaud was ""a talented filmmaker who had contributed to The New York Times over the years,"" most recently in 2015, but he ""was not on assignment for any desk at The Times in Ukraine."" TIME issued a statement later Sunday confirming that Renaud had been ""in the region working on a TIME Studios project focused on the global refugee crisis.""

Documentary filmmaker Juan Arredondo was injured in the attack, according to local reports and a video posted by a spokeswoman for a public hospital in Kyiv. Arredondo, who was lying on a hospital gurney, said he and Renaud were on their way to film people leaving Kyiv when they crossed a checkpoint and came under fire.

""Somebody offered to take us to the other bridge, and we crossed a checkpoint, and they started shooting at us. So the driver turned around, and they kept shooting, two of us. My friend is Brent Renaud, and he's been shot and left behind,"" said Arredondo, who is also American. ""I saw him being shot in the neck, and we got split, and I got pulled.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky honored Renaud as a ""talented and brave journalist"" in a letter to Renaud's family on Monday. Zelensky wrote that Renaud ""lost his life while documenting human tragedy, devastation and suffering of the millions of Ukrainians.""

""We offer our sincerest condolences to his family on their loss,"" a spokesperson said.

Nebytov, the Kyiv police chief, wrote that Renaud ""paid [with] his life for trying to highlight the aggressor's ingenuity, cruelty and ruthlessness,"" according to an automated translation of his Facebook post.

Renaud and his brother Craig Renaud have reported from a number of global hotspots over the past two decades, including Iraq, Afghanistan and Egypt, according to a biography on their website.

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan called reports of Renaud's death ""shocking and horrifying,"" telling ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday that the U.S. and its allies would impose ""appropriate consequences"" against Russia for the killing.

""I will just say that this is part and parcel of what has been a brazen aggression on the part of the Russians where they have targeted civilians, they have targeted hospitals, they have targeted places of worship and they have targeted journalists,"" Sullivan said.

Clarifying earlier reports, The Times said he was not working for the paper and had been issued the badge for an assignment many years ago.

“We are deeply saddened to hear of Brent Renaud’s death,” NYT said in a statement. Renaud was not on assignment for The Times in Ukraine, the paper said.

In an interview with Italian journalist Annalisa Camilli from the hospital, colleague Arredondo said Renaud, who was with him was shot in the neck and remained on the ground earlier on Sunday.

He told Camilli they were filming refugees fleeing the area when they were shot at while in a car approaching a checkpoint. The driver turned around but the firing at them continued, Arredondo added.

At the time of the interview, Arredondo was not aware that Renaud had not survived the attack.

“This kind of attack is totally unacceptable, and is a violation of international law,” said Carlos Martinez de la Serna, CPJ’s program director, in a statement.

“Russian forces in Ukraine must stop all violence against journalists and other civilians at once, and whoever killed Renaud should be held to account.”

Renaud along with his brother Craig spent the last decade producing films and television programs for HBO, NBC, Discovery, PBS, The New York Times and Vice News.

Winners of the Peabody Award, their projects have covered the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the earthquake in Haiti, cartel violence in Mexico and the youth refugee crisis in Central America, according to their website.

His work, much of which was conducted with his brother, Craig, received widespread acclaim for its raw, honest portrayal of human suffering.

“We are devastated by the loss of Brent Renaud,” said Edward Felsenthal, the editor in chief and CEO of TIME, and Ian Orefice, its COO, in a statement. “Our hearts are with all of Brent’s loved ones. It is essential that journalists are able to safely cover this ongoing invasion and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.”

The Kyiv regional police chief confirmed the news on Facebook.

“Of course, the profession of a journalist is a risk, but US citizen Brent Renaud paid his life for trying to highlight the aggressor’s ingenuity, cruelty and ruthlessness,” Andriy Nebytov said in the post.

Later on Sunday, a State Department spokesperson also confirmed Renaud’s death.

“We offer our sincerest condolences to his family on their loss and are offering all possible consular assistance,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “Out of respect for his family’s privacy, we have no specifics to offer at this time.”

Renaud was reported to have been wearing a New York Times press badge — though the Times said on Sunday that Renaud had not worked for the publication since 2015 and was not in Ukraine on assignment for it.

In a statement released on Twitter, Cliff Levy, deputy managing editor at the Times, said: “We are deeply saddened to hear of Brent Renaud’s death. Brent was a talented photographer and filmmaker who had contributed to The New York Times over the years.”

Asked on Sunday morning about the killing, which journalist Clarissa Ward earlier reported, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on CNN’s “State of the Union” that he had just learned of the report and was unable to confirm at the time. He added that, if an American journalist was killed, that was “a shocking and horrifying event.”

“It is one more example of the brutality of Vladimir Putin and his forces … is they’ve targeted schools and mosques and hospitals and journalists,” he added, “and it is why we’re working so hard to impose severe consequences on him and to try to help the Ukrainians with every form of military assistance we can muster to be able to push back against the onslaught of these Russian forces.”

The mayor of Irpin said on Sunday, following the shooting, that journalists would be denied entry into the city “to save the lives of both them and our defenders,” the AP reported.

The attack on an American filmmaker follows repeated Russian censorship of journalists who speak out about the reality of the invasion and contradict Russia’s false narrative about the war.

Most recently, a law was passed threatening up to 15 years imprisonment for journalists speaking out about the conflict.

An adviser to Ukraine's interior ministry, Anton Gerashchenko, says U.S. video journalist Brent Renaud has been killed in fighting in Irpin, a suburb of Kyiv. Another journalist was wounded, he says.

In a statement posted on social media, Gerashchenko says Renaud ""sacrificed his life trying to show the insidiousness, cruelty and ruthlessness of the aggressor.""

Gerashchenko shared a video of an unidentified Ukrainian in camouflage and a police badge, announcing Renaud's death. The video shows what looks like Renaud's body on the ground behind him. NPR has not been able to independently confirm this video.

Another journalist for U.S. media tweeted that she had been at the scene and witnessed Renaud's body under a blanket.

Condolences are flooding in, including from the head of Harvard's Nieman Foundation, where Renaud was a past fellow.

""Brent's filmmaking was exceptional and what made it so was not just his abundant skill but a kindness and deep humanity he brought to his work,"" Nieman curator Ann Marie Lipinski wrote. ""He told us that what he sought in his journalism was 'thoughtful stories about disenfranchised people,' and he lived up to that credo every day. His death is a devastating loss.""

The New York Times also tweeted its condolences, calling Renaud a ""talented photographer and filmmaker"" who had contributed to the Times in the past. He was not on assignment for the Times at the time of his death, it said. Gerashchenko had shared photos of an apparently outdated Times press ID with Renaud's name and photo.

He and his brother were covering the war

Renaud and his brother Craig, who is also a filmmaker, had worked on a number of documentaries together. A post on their Facebook page from March 8 indicated they were covering the conflict in Ukraine.

According to their website, the Renaud brothers have spent years ""telling humanistic verite stories from the [w]orld's hot spots,"" including Iraq, Afghanistan, Haiti and parts of Central America.

The Committee to Protect Journalists quickly condemned Renaud's killing on Sunday.

By April Thorn

As of May 9, 126 U.S. military personnel had died in Iraq out of a total of about 250,000 troops, according to Pentagon figures. Compared to previous wars, the loss to the military is remarkably low — less than 0.1 percent.

Proportionally, the loss to the media was greater. As of early May, 15 journalists had died out of an estimated 1,000 embedded and independent journalists covering the war. According to The Seattle Times, the death rate among journalists was 1.3 percent.

The first death among U.S. journalists and among the more than 500 embedded correspondent’s was Washington Post columnist and Atlantic Monthly editor Michael Kelly.

The most recent incident was the May 9 death of Boston Globe reporter Elizabeth Neuffer in an automobile accident.

Two additional journalists from British television network ITN — Fred Nerac, a French cameraman and Hussein Osman, a translator from Lebanon — have been missing since late March.

Nine journalists covering the U.S.-led war were killed in action during the first three weeks of the conflict, victims of Iraqi or U.S. fire, land mines or suicide bombers. Five other journalists died in accidents or from illness. Several more were wounded.

The Committee to Protect Journalists reported that U.S. or Iraqi forces inside Iraq temporarily detained more than 24 journalists and escorted others out of Iraq. Safety issues remain for those covering the aftermath of the war. Banditry, gunfire and physical attacks will likely make Iraq a dangerous assignment for the foreseeable future, CPJ said. It rated Iraq number one in its report, “The World’s Worst Places to be a Journalist.”

What follows is a list of those journalists killed in Iraq from March 22 to May 9.

March 22: Terry Lloyd (ITN, U.K.)

Lloyd, 50, a news correspondent for ITV News, produced by ITN, was missing after coming under fire on the southern Iraq front as he and three colleagues were driving towards Basra. The team apparently was caught in crossfire between Iraqi and coalition troops. Iraqi ambulances took a number of dead and injured from the area into the city. Confirmation later came that Lloyd’s body was found at Basra Hospital.

Lloyd was ITN’s longest-serving correspondent and is the first ITN journalist killed in the organization’s 48-year history. He had been selected to lead a “unilateral”team — reporters working independently of the military — to cover the U.S. and British advance on Basra.

March 22: Paul Moran (ABC, Australia)

Moran, 39, a cameraman for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, was killed in a suicide car bombing. The bombing has been blamed on an al-Qaida-related group based in a remote area of Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq.

Moran was waiting at a checkpoint leading into the small village of Khormal, near the town of Halabja, when he saw Kurdish militia frantically running the opposite direction. According to The Australian, he walked towards the soldiers to film the incident as a white Toyota taxi drove towards him from the direction of Khormal. The driver apparently gestured for Moran to come closer and then stopped the car beside him. The bomb killed Moran and the driver instantly as another colleague and nine Kurds were injured.

Moran, based in Paris, was a freelance cameraman contracted by the ABC to work with his team in northern Iraq.

March 30: Gaby Rado (ITN, U.K.)

Rado, 48, a foreign affairs correspondent for Channel 4 News of London, fell from the roof of the Abu Sanaa Hotel in Suleimaniya, in northern Iraq. His death is not believed to be connected to the military action in the country.

Rado suffered serious head injuries as a result of the fall onto the hotel parking lot. He was pronounced dead upon arrival at a local hospital. According to ITN, the Suleimaniya police are investigating the incident. Rado was a specialist in foreign affairs for Channel 4 News and covered most international conflicts of the past decade.

April 2: Kaveh Golestan (BBC, U.K.)

Golestan, 52, a photojournalist and BBC freelance cameraman, was killed in northern Iraq after stepping on a land mine in the town of Kifri, in the southern part of Kurdish-controlled Iraq. Golestan was part of the BBC’s four-man crew filming in Kifri, an area that saw heavy fighting between Iraqi troops and Kurdish and coalition forces. Two other members of the crew were unharmed while another colleague was taken to American Military Hospital in Sulaymaniya with a foot injury.

April 4: Michael Kelly (Atlantic Monthly/Washington Post, U.S.)

Kelly, 46, the Atlantic Monthly editor-at-large and a Washington Post columnist, was killed along with a U.S. soldier when their Humvee ran off the road and into a canal south of Baghdad. The vehicle was avoiding Iraqi fire as it approached Baghdad’s main airport. Both the driver and Kelly were trapped under water. He was embedded with the Army’s 3rd Infantry Division.

Kelly is credited with revitalizing the Atlantic Monthly, which won three National Magazine Awards last year. He stepped down as editor in Fall 2002 and planned to write a book about the history of the steel industry.

April 6: Kamaran Abdurazaq Muhamed (BBC, U.K.)

Muhamed, 25, a Kurdish translator working for the BBC, died when a U.S. jet bombed an American and Kurdish convoy. The bombing killed 18 people and wounded more than 45, including U.S. troops. The incident occured not far from the town of Kalak. Muhamed, who had worked for the BBC since mid-March, died from blood loss after losing his legs.

April 6: David Bloom (NBC, U.S.)

Bloom, 39, a co-anchor of NBC’s “Today” show weekend edition, died after suffering a pulmonary embolism. Bloom, a former White House correspondent, was traveling with the Army’s 3rd Infantry Division and transmitted images of the war from a refurbished tank he helped design called the “Bloom-mobile.”

However, the long hours immobilized lead to a blood clot in his leg that doctors believe caused the embolism. A pulmonary embolism is caused by an obstruction of the pulmonary artery in the lungs by a blood clot usually originating from a vein in the leg or pelvis. The most common cause is a clot formed deep in the leg due to long periods of immobilization.

April 7: Julio Anguita Parrado (El Mundo, Spain)

Perrado, 31, a journalist for the Spanish newspaper El Mundo, was killed in an Iraqi missile strike nine miles south of central Baghdad. He was traveling with the Army’s 3rd Infantry Division. The infantry was advancing into Baghdad and one of Saddam Hussein’s palaces.

Perrado was normally assigned to New York for the newspaper and covered the September 11 attacks, but decided to go to Iraq once the war broke out.

April 7: Christian Liebig (Focus, Germany)

Liebig, 35, worked for Focus, a German newsweekly and was one of a few German journalists who received permission to be embedded with U.S. forces in Iraq. He was killed in the same Iraqi missile attack south of Baghdad that killed Parrado.

Liebig was traveling with the 2nd Brigade of the Army’s 3rd Infantry Division and was located in a camp the brigade set up as its tactical command and control center when the missile struck.

April 8: Tareq Ayyoub (Al-Jazeera, Qatar)

Ayyoub, 35, a Palestinian Jordanian, and an Al-Jazeera correspondent in Baghdad, died from wounds he suffered when the Al-Jazeera office was struck in a U.S. bombing mission. The office was a two-story house in a residential area and located on a road that connects the Information Ministry with the old presidential palace compound. He had arrived in Baghdad only a week before the bombing.

April 8: Taras Protsyuk (Reuters, U.K.)

Renaud’s killing not only marks the first of a U.S. journalist covering the conflict in Ukraine, but the first confirmed killing of a U.S. journalist on the job since 2018.

There were 55 killings of journalists and media workers worldwide in 2021.

The death of U.S. documentarian Brent Renaud on Sunday marks the first killing of a U.S. journalist while on the job since 2018.

Renaud, 51, was shot and killed by the Russian military while in a car crossing a Ukrainian checkpoint in Irpin, a suburb of Kyiv. Renaud was in the country covering the invasion, as well as the plight of Ukrainians attempting to flee.

“RSF is deeply troubled by reports of the death of filmmaker Brent Renaud and the wounding of a fellow journalist while reporting in a suburb of #Kyiv,” Reporters Without Borders tweeted. “We call for light [to] be shed on the circumstances of the attack. Journalists must not be targets of war!”

Renaud is the first U.S. journalist killed covering the war in Ukraine. Pierre Zakrzewski, a Fox News cameraman, and Oleksandra Kuvshynova, a Ukrainian journalist, were killed after an attack on Monday. Fox News correspondent Benjamin Hall was also injured during the attack. Yevhenii Sakun, correspondent and cameraman for Ukrainian television, was killed on March 1 from shelling by the Russian army.

According to data from the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the last killing of a working U.S. journalist was in 2018 when five journalists — Gerald Fischman, 61, Rob Hiaasen, 59, John McNamara, 56, Rebecca Smith, 34, and Wendi Winters, 65 — were murdered in a mass shooting at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Md.

There were 55 killings of journalists and media workers worldwide in 2021, according to the UN, and 9 out of 10 journalist killings since 2006 have gone unresolved.

“Reporting on this war is a vital public service, and it has already claimed the lives of at least two other journalists in just a few weeks,” Gulnoza Said, Europe and Central Asia program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists, said in a press release. “Ukrainian and Russian authorities must do their utmost to ensure safety of all journalists, and to thoroughly investigate attacks on the press.”

The Take podcast: Is Russia’s Syria playbook being used in Ukraine?

What can 11 years of war in Syria tell us about Ukraine? This week marks the anniversary of Syria’s uprising and there still seems to be no end to conflict in sight.

There’s also another date that resonates: September 30, 2015, when Russia intervened on behalf of President Bashar al-Assad’s government.

Russia said it tested at least 320 new types of weapons in Syria, some of which are now in use in the war in Ukraine, and it is using tactics that seem to come from what has been called the “Syria playbook”.

We look at how the people all too familiar with that playbook see Syria’s story in Ukraine.

The lender added that if the conflict is prolonged, the situation will worsen. Citing wartime data for conflicts in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen, it predicted the “annual output contraction could eventually be much higher, in the range of 25 to 35 percent.”

Erdogan says unclear whether Turkey will buy more Russian arms

NATO member Turkey was handed US sanctions in December 2020 over its purchase of Russian S-400 missile defence systems and had been criticised by Western allies over the move. Ankara has said it was forced to opt for the Russian weapons because allies did not provide arms on satisfactory terms.

Land corridor ‘links’ annexed Crimea, separatist-held Donbass regions

The deputy head of the annexed peninsula of Crimea claims that a land corridor now links the area with the separatist Donbas region in eastern Ukraine.

“We are in the heart of Irpin city, the front line where the Ukrainian army is engaged in fierce fighting with the Russians. We tried to advance towards downtown, but it seems that the Russians made it before us.

The Ukrainian troops are shooting in all directions, saying Russian snipers are stationed on rooftops to prevent the civilians from leaving the city. Dozens of residents were seen leaving from this area as well as the eastern side of Irpin.

The Ukrainians said they managed to fend off the Russians this morning. You can see the Ukrainian army’s forefront, they are trying to force the Russians back.

To my right, also fierce exchange of gunfire. It seems the Russians are advancing from more than one direction (natural sound… firing)… heavy machine guns and anti-craft guns are fired… (natural)…. (sky) they are firing into the air. It seems like a drone is hovering above… (natural)…. In this spot, and a few minutes before we arrived, dozens of civilian residents had left the city.

They claim the Russian forces granted them only a 15-minute window to leave the area before roads are closed. Many of the residents who were stranded in the eastern suburbs of Irpin managed to leave.

The Ukrainian troops are adamant to fight to force the Russians back since thousands of civilians are still trapped in northern and eastern parts of the city.”

Russian default no longer ‘improbable’

Russia may default on its debts in the wake of unprecedented sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine, but that would not trigger a global financial crisis, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has said.

Georgieva told CBS’s “Face the Nation” programme that sanctions imposed by the United States and other democracies were already having a “severe” effect on the Russian economy and would trigger a deep recession there this year.

The sanctions were limiting Russia’s ability to access its resources and service its debts, which meant a default was no longer viewed as “improbable,” the IMF official said.

Asked if such a default could trigger a financial crisis around the world, she said, “For now, no.”

12.03.2022 17:04 W analizie opublikowanej po 16 dniach walk eksperci Ośrodka Studiów Wschodnich (OSW) Andrzej Wilk, Piotr Żochowski i Sławomir Matuszak zwracają uwagę, że działania sił rosyjskich na Ukrainie stają się coraz bardziej brutalne, jednak Rosjanie nadal nie są w stanie złamać oporu Ukraińców. Szczątkowe informacje pojawiające się w ukraińskich komunikatach o sytuacji w rejonie walk sprawiają, że całość przekazu coraz częściej jest wewnętrznie sprzeczna. Działania agresora nie wskazują, by utracił on inicjatywę, a ponoszone straty nadal nie uniemożliwiają mu kontynuowania ofensywy na kilku kierunkach równocześnie - ocenia OSW. Kwestią otwartą pozostaje, na ile prezentowana przez stronę ukraińską ocena przeciwnika odpowiada stanowi faktycznemu, a na ile ma na celu głównie podtrzymywanie morale własnej armii i społeczeństwa - wskazują eksperci. Jak podkreślają, brutalizacji ulegają działania rosyjskich sił okupacyjnych, które skupiają się na terroryzowaniu ludności cywilnej i aresztowaniach osób stawiających opór. Jako przykład działań zastraszających wskazują porwanie i uwięzienie mera Melitopola, który odmówił współpracy z okupantem. Rosjanie nadal nie są w stanie narzucić swojej administracji cywilnej i doprowadzić do złamania oporu społecznego na zajętym terytorium - oceniają analitycy OSW. Zauważają, że piątkowe spotkanie Łukaszenka–Putin stało się obiektem ukraińskiej operacji informacyjnej, której celem było pogłębienie obaw w społeczeństwie białoruskim co do negatywnych skutków wspierania przez Mińsk rosyjskiej agresji na Ukrainę. W dniu spotkania przywódców Kijów poinformował o rosyjskich samolotach bombardujących wioskę na Białorusi, co jakoby miałoby doprowadzić do wydania przez Mińsk rozkazu ataku na Ukrainę. Władze ukraińskie podkreślają że Łukaszenka nie może ufać własnej armii, która nie jest przygotowana do prowadzenia działań bojowych, a jej morale jest niskie. Aktywność informacyjna Kijowa zmusiła białoruski resort obrony do kolejnego uspokajającego oświadczenia, w którym zapewniło własne społeczeństwo, że armia białoruska nie wejdzie na Ukrainę - wskazuje OSW. Jak ocenia, zapowiadane dostawy rosyjskiej broni i pomoc finansowa dla Mińska są z punktu widzenia Kremla formą ""premii"" za możliwość nieograniczonego wykorzystywania białoruskiego terytorium i jej zaplecza logistycznego do dalszego prowadzenia działań bojowych w kierunku Kijowa. Otwartą kwestią pozostaje użycie przez Rosjan części sił zbrojnych Białorusi jako wsparcia dla własnych działań na Ukrainie. Taka decyzja byłaby ryzykowna ze względu na niską motywację jednostek białoruskich, ale nie można wykluczyć, że zostaną one wykorzystane jako osłona tyłów wojsk rosyjskich - podkreślają eksperci. Przeszkodą w rozpoczęciu kampanii siewnej mogą być, ich zdaniem, nie tylko działania wojenne, ale też deficyt paliwa, który może nastąpić w najbliższych tygodniach. Jak wskazują, Ukraina jest uzależniona od importu benzyny i oleju napędowego z Białorusi i Rosji, dostawy tych paliw w obecnej sytuacji zostały wstrzymane. W celu uniknięcia deficytu rząd Ukrainy wprowadził zmiany do formuły cenowej ustalającej maksymalną cenę za paliwa sprowadzane z Zachodu oraz zapowiedział zniesienie akcyzy i zmniejszenie VAT z 20 do 7 proc. Brak zasiewów na znacznej części kraju doprowadziłby do pogłębienia kryzysu żywnościowego na rynkach światowych - wskazuje OSW. Ukraina jest największym na świecie eksporterem oleju słonecznikowego oraz mieści się w piątce największych eksporterów pszenicy, kukurydzy i rzepaku. Zboża i oleje roślinne są kluczowymi kategoriami w eksporcie Ukrainy – w 2021 r. przypadło na nie 19,4 mld USD (30 proc. całości zagranicznej sprzedaży towarów). Ograniczony eksport złóż negatywnie odbije się na bilansie handlowym i finansach państwa. Jednocześnie nawet znaczące ograniczenie powierzchni zasiewów nie powinno doprowadzić do problemów z żywnością w kraju. (PAP) FB

12.03.2022 16:51 Rosyjskie siły okupacyjne zamierzają przeprowadzić „pseudoreferendum” w mieście portowym Chersoń na południu Ukrainy, by utworzyć tam kolejny region separatystyczny – oznajmił w sobotę deputowany chersońskiej rady obwodowej Serhij Chłań na Facebooku. Chłań oznajmił, że okupanci telefonują do jego kolegów z pytaniem, czy są gotowi do współpracy. „Kategorycznie odmówiłem. Apeluję do wszystkich deputowanych rady obwodowej (…) Stworzenie +Chersońskiej Republiki Ludowej+ przeobrazi nasz kraj w beznadziejną dziurę pozbawioną życia i przyszłości.

Na drodze między wioskami Nesterianka i Myrne w powiecie orichiwskim samochód Tavria z cywilami, którzy chcieli opuścić teren niebezpiecznych działań wojennych, zatrzymał się na poboczu. Wtedy na pojazd najechał czołg. Według Prokuratora Generalnego Ukrainy od początku rosyjskiej agresji na Ukrainę zginęło 79 dzieci, a prawie 100 doznało obrażeń. (PAP) FB

12.03.2022 16:11 Po 16 dniach walk na Ukrainie działania agresora nie wskazują, by utracił on inicjatywę, a ponoszone straty nadal nie uniemożliwiają mu kontynuowania ofensywy na kilku kierunkach równocześnie - informują eksperci Ośrodka Studiów Wschodnich: Andrzej Wilk, Sławomir Matuszak i Piotr Żochowski w analizie po 16 dniach walk. Trwają walki o kontrolę nad miejscowościami graniczącymi z Kijowem. Siły agresora miały podejść do miasta od zachodu (na wysokości miasta Irpień), a także od północnego i południowego wschodu. Według brytyjskiego resortu obrony główna część rosyjskiego zgrupowania lądowego ma znajdować się 25 km od centrum Kijowa. Pod kontrolą ukraińską pozostaje wyjazd w kierunku południowym. Po zewnętrznej stronie pierścienia oblężenia siły ukraińskie miały zniszczyć rosyjskie stanowisko dowodzenia koło Makarowa. Nieprzerwanie kontynuowany jest ostrzał pozostającego w okrążeniu Mikołajowa, a nocą w mieście trwały walki. Ukraina powołała Komendę Koordynacyjną ds. postępowania z jeńcami wojny, mającą zagwarantować ich bezpieczeństwo. Rosyjski resort obrony wezwał stronę ukraińską do zapewnienia bezpiecznego wyjścia z ukraińskich portów statkom obcych bander. W portach Ukrainy znajduje się ponad 50 takich statków. Rosyjski komunikat w sposób zawoalowany sugeruje, że główne porty, a zwłaszcza Odessa, staną się wkrótce obszarem działań wojennych. Strona rosyjska nadal zakłóca wykorzystywanie korytarzy humanitarnych, oskarżając władze Ukrainy o rzekome ich blokowanie. Główne siły rosyjskie na wschodzie Ukrainy, ześrodkowane w rejonach miasta Łebedyn (40 km na południowy zachód od Sum), Wełyka Pysariwka (70 km od Sum i Charkowa) oraz Siewierodonieck i Swatowe w obwodzie ługańskim, miały nie prowadzić aktywnych działań. Ze szczątkowych informacji Sztabu Generalnego wynika jednak, że agresor kontynuował ofensywę z rejonu Połtawy w kierunku Krzemieńczuka, wciąż blokuje Sumy i kontynuuje działania na rzecz zablokowania Charkowa od północy. W obwodzie charkowskim zaktywizowała się ukraińska obrona terytorialna, atakując rosyjską kolumnę zaopatrzeniową koło Czuhujewa. Ukraiński Sztab Generalny ocenił, że od 24 lutego straty rosyjskie wyniosły w przybliżeniu: ponad 12 tysięcy ludzi (zabitych, rannych i wziętych do niewoli), 362 czołgi, 1205 pojazdów opancerzonych, 135 systemów artyleryjskich, 62 wyrzutnie rakietowe, 33 systemy obrony przeciwlotniczej, 58 samolotów i 83 śmigłowce, siedem bezzałogowców, 585 pojazdów kołowych. Według szacunkowych danych wzięto do niewoli około 700 żołnierzy. Z kolei rosyjski resort obrony ocenia, że od początku konfliktu straty ukraińskie objęły 3491 obiektów infrastruktury wojskowej, 123 bezzałogowe statki powietrzne, 1127 czołgów i pojazdów opancerzonych, 115 wyrzutni rakietowych, 423 działa i moździerze, 934 pojazdy wojskowe.(PAP) FB

Według stanu z dzisiejszego rana można powiedzieć, że na najważniejszych kierunkach operacyjnych przeciwnik wyczerpał swój potencjał do ataku i przeszedł do obrony” – oznajmił Arestowycz, dodając, że tak się dzieje na wyżej wymienionych kierunkach, gdzie siły wroga „usiłują posuwać się do przodu, ale giną pod naszymi uderzeniami”. Jedynym kierunkiem, w którym wojska rosyjskie starają się kontynuować natarcie, jest Siewierodonieck, oraz okolice Wołnowachy i Mariupola - zaznaczył. „Strategiczny przełom, o którym wczoraj mówił prezydent (Wołodymyr Zełenski), nastąpił. Możemy się nie bać (…). Ale trzeba zdawać sobie sprawę, że nie oznacza to końca wojny” – oznajmił.(PAP) FB

Próbując zablokować miasto Czernihów, położone około 140 km na północny wschód od Kijowa, wojska rosyjskie usiłowały zająć oddalone o kilkanaście kilometrów wsie Mychajło-Kozyubińske i Szestowica. Prezydent Ukrainy Wołodymyr Zelenski powiedział w piątek, że w wyniku ostrzału Czernihowa uszkodzone zostały miejskie wodociągi. W rezultacie miasto, w którym żyje prawie 280 tys. ludzi, pozostaje bez wody.

11.03.2022 19:28 Premier Izraela Naftali Benet miał poradzić prezydentowi Ukrainy Wołodymyrowi Zełenskiemu, by przyjął ofertę Rosji w sprawie zakończenia wojny - podał w piątek portal Axios, powołując się na wysokiego rangą przedstawiciela władz ukraińskich. Izrael zaprzeczył tym doniesieniom. Według cytowanego przez portal źródła, określonego mianem ""wysokiego rangą ukraińskiego urzędnika"", Zełenski miał odrzucić sugestię Beneta. Axios nie podał treści rosyjskiej oferty, jednak publicznie Kreml żądał ""demilitaryzacji"" i neutralności Ukrainy oraz uznania aneksji Krymu i tzw. republik ludowych w Donbasie. ""Benet w gruncie rzeczy mówi nam, żebyśmy się poddali, a my nie mamy zamiaru tego zrobić"" - powiedział rozmówca portalu. Informacjom tym zaprzeczyła osoba z biura izraelskiego premiera, która stwierdziła, że Benet ""nie zamierza dawać Zełenskiemu żadnych rad ani rekomendacji"", a jego wysiłki na rzecz mediacji w konflikcie są skupione na powstrzymaniu przelewu krwi. Dodał, że rozmowa przebiegła w dobrej atmosferze. Przekazał, że poruszono temat ewentualnego spotkania w Jerozolimie w sprawie mediacji. Cytowany przez Axiosa przedstawiciel władz Ukrainy krytycznie odniósł się do izraelskich wysiłków, twierdząc, że rola mediatora powinna polegać na proponowaniu kompromisów, a nie przekazywaniu wiadomości. ""Nie potrzebujemy kolejnej skrzynki pocztowej"" - określił. Według Axiosa Kijów podejrzewa też, że dyplomatyczne próby Beneta są podyktowane chęcią niezajmowania ostrego stanowiska wobec Rosji. Izraelskie władze miały ponadto powiedzieć Ukrainie, by przestały ubiegać się o pomoc wojskową lub wsparcie polityczne, bo zaszkodzi to pozycji Izraela jako mediatora.(PAP) FB

09.03.2022 20:01 Mimo uzgodnień w sprawie korytarzy humanitarnych ewakuacja cywilów w środę w wielu miastach Ukrainy nie odbyła się - pisze ukraińska redakcja BBC. Rosyjscy wojskowi m.in. przeszkodzili ewakuacji z Mariupola. Udało się ewakuować mieszkańców Enerhodaru i Worzela. Szef frakcji parlamentarnej rządzącej na Ukrainie partii Sługa Narodu Dawyd Arachamija poinformował, że w ciągu doby udało się ewakuować ponad 40 tys. kobiet i dzieci. ""Próbowaliśmy 100 tysięcy, ale nie wyszło"" - dodał. Ocenił, że najtrudniejsze odcinki to Mariupol, Charków i obwód kijowski. W obwodzie kijowskim Rosjanie na posterunku w miejscowości Stojanka przeszkodzili w ewakuacji kilku tysięcy cywilów z Buczy i Hostomla, którzy jechali 50 autobusami. Udało się natomiast ewakuować ludzi z Worzela - pisze BBC. Wśród ewakuowanych jest 50 dzieci z domu dziecka. Z Irpienia i Worzela ewakuowano ponad 3 tys. ludzi, w tym kilkaset dzieci, osób starszych i ciężko chorych - podała policja, cytowana przez agencję Interfax-Ukraina. Państwowa Służba ds. Sytuacji Nadzwyczajnych przekazała natomiast, że do Kijowa przybywają autobusy z ewakuowanymi mieszkańcami Hostomla, Buczy, Worzela, Irpienia i Borodianki. ""Ludzie przez wiele dni nie mogli opuścić swoich mieszkań przez bombardowania i ostrzały, ale nareszcie im się to udało dzięki +zielonemu korytarzowi+"" - napisano w komunikacie. Ewakuowani otrzymują jedzenie na dworcu kolejowym w Kijowie i są kierowani do pociągów ewakuacyjnych. Przedstawiciel wojskowej administracji obwodu kijowskiego Witalij Własiuk powiedział z kolei BBC, że ewakuacja z Borodianki się nie odbyła, bo rosyjscy wojskowi zablokowali kolumnę. Zaznaczył, że część mieszkańców Buczy i Hostomla mogła dojść do Worzela i stamtąd wyjechać. W obwodzie zaporoskim odbyła się ewakuacja z Enerhodaru. Po trzech godzinach oczekiwania autobusy wyjechały w kierunku Zaporoża - pisze portal Suspilne. Z miasta Sumy wyjechało 25 ewakuacyjnych autobusów z ponad 1000 ludzi. Korytarzem humanitarnym w stronę Połtawy jedzie 6 tys. samochodów z ponad 20 tys. ludzi. Z Iziumu w obwodzie charkowskim udało się ewakuować 250 mieszkańców, ale nie było korytarza humanitarnego. ""Faktycznie +zielonego korytarza+ nie było. Rosja cynicznie oszukała i nas i cały świat. Z ludzi po prostu robią zakładników"" - podkreślił zastępca mera Wołodymyr Macokin. Znów nie doszło do ewakuacji cywilów z Mariupola, Rosjanie też uniemożliwili wjechanie do miasta humanitarnego konwoju.

Some of the buildings on Snake Island appear damaged from Russian military strikes, and a Russian Naval ship is seen anchored off the island in the first clear satellite image of the Ukrainian island in the middle of the Black Sea.

The image, taken on Sunday by Maxar Technologies, is the first clear look of the island since it was bombed at the beginning of the Russian invasion.

In the image, some of the red-roofed buildings in the island's center are shown to have been significantly damaged by the Russian shelling of the island. The ship seen offshore was identified by Maxar as a Ropucha-class landing ship. Although parts of it are snow-covered, there are impact craters dotting parts of the island.

Snake Island, also known as Zmiinyi Island, sits about 30 miles (48 kilometers) off the Ukrainian mainland's southern tip in the northwestern Black Sea. It's about 185 miles west of Crimea, the Ukrainian territory that Russia annexed in 2014.

The defiant soldiers who were stationed on the island quickly became lauded as heroes at the start of the Russian invasion into Ukraine.

Initial reports from the Ukrainian government claimed they responded to a warning from a Russian naval ship to lay down their weapons or they would be bombed. Their reported reply was, “Russian warship, go f*** yourself.” The Ukrainian Navy had feared the soldiers on the island were dead, but now believe they are “alive and well” but are prisoners of war.

She Has Worked As A Reporter Covering Business', 'Agribusiness', 'Medicine', 'Police At The Columbus Dispatch']",2022-03-04 10:55:28+00:00,"A group of 13 Ukrainian soldiers stationed on Snake Island in the Black Sea has captured the world’s attention, but the group has also been the subject of confounding social media reports about their status.

The soldiers were initially reported dead after a Russian warship attacked Snake Island, also known as Zmiiny Island, but they now are believed to be alive and in Russia.

Russia and Ukraine offered competing accounts about how the soldiers came to be in Russian custody. Russia says they surrendered, while Ukraine maintains they were taken captive.

From a Feb. 25 video on Facebook that says the soldiers had been killed, to a TikTok video shared in a Feb. 27 post on Facebook that says they voluntarily surrendered to Russia, conflicting and partisan information has made it difficult to discern the facts.

Against this backdrop, Russia has been misleadingly portraying Ukrainian troops as weak and surrendering to Russia.

What we know

The saga began with a Feb. 24 confrontation between a Russian warship and the 13 Ukrainian soldiers who were guarding Snake Island, located east of the southern border between Ukraine and Romania on the Black Sea. An audio recording, first published by Ukrainian news outlet Ukrayinska Pravda, captured the exchange between the two groups. NPR said it had confirmed the authenticity of the recording with Ukrainian and U.S. defense officials.

The Russian ship warned the soldiers to surrender “to avoid bloodshed and unnecessary deaths,” NPR reported. “Otherwise, you will be bombed.”

One of the Ukrainians responded, “Russian warship. Go f— yourself.”

Russia “fired from naval weapons and used combat aircraft,” leaving the island’s infrastructure destroyed and the island captured, the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine said in a Feb. 26 post on Facebook.

Just after the attack, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the soldiers “died heroically but did not give up,” and that they would be honored as heroes, the New York Times reported.

But Russian state media later reported that 82 people, including the soldiers from Snake Island, were in Russia’s custody. State media released photos of the soldiers, whom it said had been taken to Sevastopol in Crimea.

The Ukraine Navy said in a Feb. 28 post on Facebook that the other people who were captured were from a civilian ship sent to help after the attack.

“The SBGSU and the Armed Forces, like the whole of Ukraine, have received hope that all of Zmiiny’s defenders are alive,” the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine said in a Feb. 26 post on Facebook.

What we don’t know

The circumstances of the Ukrainian soldiers’ capture is in dispute.

A Russian state media outlet characterized it as a surrender. But Russia has used hackers and fake social media accounts to portray Ukrainian soldiers as weak and surrendering.

And the TikTok video shared Feb. 27 on Facebook, which says the soldiers voluntarily surrendered to Russia, is from the account for RT News, an American cable network funded by the government of Russia.

Ukraine said the Snake Island infrastructure was destroyed in the Russian attack, and the audio recording of the incident indicates that the soldiers were defiant, all of which calls into question whether the surrender was voluntary.

Ukraine decried the Russian efforts to portray it as a surrender.

“We understand that Russian propagandists know how to make the necessary information attacks and use them, noting that Ukrainian defenders have surrendered,” the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine said in a Feb. 26 post on Facebook. “Border guards and fighters of the Armed Forces bravely defended themselves, especially in the face of the overwhelming means of defeat and enemy forces.”

* Russian air strike hits military base near Polish border

* Moscow says destroyed weapons, killed ‘foreign mercenaries’

* Ukraine, Russia both hint at progress in talks on war

* U.S. journalist killed near Kyiv

LVIV, Ukraine, March 13 (Reuters) - Russian missiles hit a large Ukrainian base near the border with NATO member Poland on Sunday, killing 35 people and wounding 134, a local official said, in an escalation of the war to the west of the country as intense fighting was reported elsewhere.

Russia’s defence ministry said the air strike had destroyed a large amount of weapons supplied by foreign nations that were being stored at the sprawling training facility, and that it had killed “up to 180 foreign mercenaries”.

Reuters could not independently verify the casualties reported by either side.

The attack on the Yavoriv International Centre for Peacekeeping and Security, a base just 15 miles (25 km) from the Polish border that has previously hosted NATO military instructors, brought the conflict to the doorstep of the Western defence alliance.

Russia had warned on Saturday that convoys of Western arms shipments to Ukraine could be considered legitimate targets.

Britain said the incident marked a “significant escalation”. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan, speaking on CBS’s “Face the Nation”, said any attack on NATO territory would trigger a full response by the alliance.

Regional governor Maksym Kozytskyy said Russian planes fired around 30 rockets at the Yavoriv facility and that some were intercepted. At least 35 people were killed and 134 wounded, he said.

Russian defence ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov said Russia had used high-precision, long-range weapons to strike Yavoriv and a separate facility in the village of Starichi.

“As a result of the strike, up to 180 foreign mercenaries and a large amount of foreign weapons were destroyed,” he said.

The 360-square km (140-square mile) facility is one of Ukraine’s biggest and is the largest in the western part of the country, which has so far been spared the worst of the fighting.

Ukraine, whose aspirations to join NATO are a major irritant to Russian President Vladimir Putin, held most of its drills with Western countries at the base before the invasion. The last major exercises were in September.

In the weeks before Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion, the Ukrainian military trained there, but according to Ukrainian media all foreign instructors left in mid-February, leaving behind equipment.

“The dining room and dormitory were destroyed. So were the barracks,” said Colonel Leonid Benzalo, an officer in the Ukrainian medical reserve who was thrown across the room by one of the blasts. “The most important thing is we’re still alive,” he told Reuters after treating the wounded there.

While Western nations have sought to isolate Putin by imposing harsh economic sanctions and have been supplying Ukraine with weapons, the United States and its allies are concerned to avoid NATO being drawn into the conflict.

“There are no NATO personnel in Ukraine,” the NATO official said, when asked if anyone from the alliance was at the base.

STOCKPILING FOOD

Heavy fighting was reported on multiple fronts.

Air raid sirens wailed across the capital Kyiv and authorities said they were stockpiling two weeks worth of food items for the 2 million people who have not yet fled from Russian forces attempting to encircle the city.

Ukraine reported renewed air strikes on an airport in the west and heavy shelling on Chernihiv northeast of the capital.

Interior Ministry official Vadym Denyenko said Ukrainian forces were counterattacking in the eastern Kharkiv region and around the southern town of Mykolayiv. Reuters was not able to verify those statements.

An American journalist was shot and killed by Russian forces in the town of Irpin, northwest of Kyiv, and another journalist was wounded, the regional police chief said.

Despite the violence, both sides gave their most upbeat assessment yet of prospects for progress at talks held periodically.

“Russia is already beginning to talk constructively,” Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak said in a video online. “I think that we will achieve some results literally in a matter of days.”

A Russian delegate to talks, Leonid Slutsky, was quoted by RIA news agency as saying they had made significant progress and it was possible the delegations could soon reach draft agreements.

Neither side said what these would cover. Three rounds of talks between the two sides in Belarus, most recently last Monday, had focused mainly on humanitarian issues.

But there were contradictory statements on the timing of new discussions. Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych told national television “talks are continuing right now.” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied this, saying talks were planned for Monday via video link.

Seeking to up the ante on the increasingly sanctions-hit Russian economy, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in a Twitter post, called on U.S. software firms Microsoft Corp and Oracle Corp and German business software group SAP to halt support services in Russia.

‘VIOLENT AND INHUMAN’

In the weeks since the invasion began, Russia has asked China - which has not condemned the assault on Ukraine - for military equipment, the Financial Times and Washington Post cited unnamed U.S. officials as saying.

A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington said he had not heard of such a request and that the priority was to prevent the situation “from escalating or even getting out of control.”

Russia’s invasion has sent more than 2.5 million people fleeing across Ukraine’s borders and trapped hundreds of thousands in besieged cities.

“It is terrifying how violent and inhuman it is,” Olga, a refugee from Kyiv, told Reuters after crossing into Romania.

Ukraine’s human rights monitor said Russia used phosphorous bombs in an overnight attack on the town of Popasna in the eastern Luhansk region, calling it a “war crime”. She shared a photograph purporting to show the alleged attack. Reuters could not immediately verify any of the reports.

Phosphorus munitions can be used legally in war to provide light, create smokescreens or burn buildings. But its use in populated areas has been a persistent source of controversy.

In eastern Ukraine, Russian troops were trying to surround Ukrainian forces as they advance from the port of Mariupol in the south and the second city Kharkiv in the north, the British Defence Ministry said.

The city council in Mariupol said in a statement that 2,187 residents had been killed since the start of the invasion. Reuters was not able to verify that toll.

Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, has suffered some of the heaviest bombardment. Videos from one resident, Teimur Aliev, showed bombed buildings lining streets, burned-out cars riddled with shrapnel holes and debris strewn around.

“We will stitch up the wounds and the pain of our country and our city,” said Aliev, a 23-year-old musician. “We’re not going anywhere.”

In Chernihiv, northeast of Kyiv, firefighters rescued residents from a burning building after heavy shelling, video from emergency service - and verified by Reuters - showed.

Moscow denies targeting civilians. It blames Ukraine for failed attempts to evacuate civilians from encircled cities, an accusation Ukraine and its Western allies strongly reject.

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on national television that more than 140,000 people had been evacuated from conflict zones, but that a humanitarian convoy had been unable to reach Mariupol due to shelling.

* Russian air strike hits military base near Polish border

* Moscow says destroyed weapons, killed ‘foreign mercenaries’

* Ukraine, Russia both hint at progress in talks on war

* U.S. journalist killed near Kyiv

LVIV, Ukraine, March 13 (Reuters) - Russian missiles hit a large Ukrainian base near the border with NATO member Poland on Sunday, killing 35 people and wounding 134, a local official said, in an escalation of the war to the west of the country as intense fighting was reported elsewhere.

Russia’s defence ministry said the air strike had destroyed a large amount of weapons supplied by foreign nations that were being stored at the sprawling training facility, and that it had killed “up to 180 foreign mercenaries”.

Reuters could not independently verify the casualties reported by either side.

The attack on the Yavoriv International Centre for Peacekeeping and Security, a base just 15 miles (25 km) from the Polish border that has previously hosted NATO military instructors, brought the conflict to the doorstep of the Western defence alliance.

Russia’s deputy foreign minister had warned on Saturday that convoys of Western arms shipments to Ukraine could be considered legitimate targets.

Britain said the incident marked a “significant escalation” of the conflict. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan, speaking on CBS’s “Face the Nation”, said any attack on NATO territory would trigger a full response by the alliance.

Regional governor Maksym Kozytskyy said Russian planes fired around 30 rockets at the Yavoriv facility, adding that some were intercepted. At least 35 people were killed and 134 wounded, he said.

Russian defence ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov said Russia had used high-precision, long-range weapons to strike Yavoriv and a separate facility in the village of Starichi.

“As a result of the strike, up to 180 foreign mercenaries and a large amount of foreign weapons were destroyed,” he told a briefing.

The 360-square km (140-square mile) facility is one of Ukraine’s biggest and is the largest in the western part of the country, which has so far been spared the worst of the fighting.

Ukraine, whose aspirations to join NATO are a major irritant to Russian President Vladimir Putin, held most of its drills with Western countries at the base before the invasion. The last major exercises were in September.

In the weeks before Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion, the Ukrainian military trained there, but according to Ukrainian media all foreign instructors left in mid-February, leaving behind equipment.

While Western nations have sought to isolate Putin by imposing harsh economic sanctions and have been supplying Ukraine with weapons, the United States and its allies are concerned to avoid NATO being drawn into the conflict.

“There are no NATO personnel in Ukraine,” the NATO official said, when asked if anyone from the alliance was at the base.

STOCKPILING FOOD

Heavy fighting was reported on multiple fronts.

Air raid sirens wailed once again across the capital Kyiv and authorities said they were stockpiling two weeks worth of essential food items for the 2 million people who have not yet fled from Russian forces attempting to encircle the city.

Ukraine reported renewed air strikes on an airport in the west and heavy shelling on Chernihiv northeast of the capital.

Interior Ministry official Vadym Denyenko said Ukrainian forces were counterattacking in the eastern Kharkiv region and around the southern town of Mykolayiv. Reuters was not able to verify those statements.

An American journalist was shot and killed by Russian forces in the town of Irpin, northwest of Kyiv, and another journalist was wounded, the regional police chief said.

Despite the violence, both sides gave their most upbeat assessment yet of the prospects for progress at bilateral talks that have been held periodically since the start of the invasion.

“Russia is already beginning to talk constructively,” Ukrainian negotiator and presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said in a video posted online. “I think that we will achieve some results literally in a matter of days.”

A Russian delegate to talks with Ukraine, Leonid Slutsky, was quoted by RIA news agency as saying they had made significant progress and it was possible the delegations could soon reach draft agreements.

Neither side said what these would cover. Three rounds of talks between the two sides in Belarus, most recently last Monday, had focused mainly on humanitarian issues.

But there were contradictory statements on the timing of new discussions. Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych told national television “talks are continuing right now.” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied this, saying talks were planned for Monday via video link.

Seeking to up the ante on the increasingly sanctions-hit Russian economy, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in a Twitter post, called on U.S. software firms Microsoft Corp and Oracle Corp and German business software group SAP to halt support services in Russia.

‘VIOLENT AND INHUMAN’

Russia’s invasion has sent more than 2.5 million people fleeing across Ukraine’s borders and trapped hundreds of thousands in besieged cities.

“It is terrifying how violent and inhuman it is,” Olga, a refugee from Kyiv, told Reuters after crossing into Romania.

Ukraine’s human rights monitor said Russia used phosphorous bombs in an overnight attack on the town of Popasna in the eastern Luhansk region, calling it a “war crime”. She shared a photograph purporting to show the alleged attack, but did not say if Ukraine had concrete evidence. Reuters could not immediately verify any of the reports.

During a background briefing on Monday, the official said “almost all” of Moscow’s assaults have failed to make any progress, not just in the capital Kyiv but in Chernihiv and Kharkiv too.

Russian troops are still reported to be 15km from Kyiv’s city centre, the same distance they were at on Friday.

Shelling in the city, however, has not ceased, with fresh explosions reported overnight after two people were killed when an air strike hit an apartment block on Tuesday morning.

The official noted that Russia is trying to “flow in forces behind the advance elements” moving to the north of the Ukrainian capital.

In Chernihiv and Kharkiv, Russia has split off a force of 50 to 60 vehicles to move towards the town of Izium, in an apparent bid to block Ukrainian forces arriving from the West, CNN reports.

The US official also said that while the besieged Mariupol – where its 400,000 residents have been without water, food and power for two weeks – remains in Ukrainian hands, the Black Sea city remains isolated.

Repeated attempts to open humanitarian corridors to allow for its residents to leave have failed as Russia and Ukraine traded accusations of breaching the ceasefires. But on Monday a ceasefire held, allowing for the evacuation of 160 cars.

A Mariupol City Council Telegram post early on Tuesday said the number of people killed in the port city as of March 14 stood at approximately 2,357 people.

Meanwhile two powerful explosions rocked the capital Kyiv before dawn, and air raid sirens were heard in different regions including Odesa, Chernihiv, Cherkasy and Smila.

Ukraine reported more air strikes on an airport in the west, heavy shelling on Chernihiv northeast of Kyiv and attacks on the southern town of Mykolayiv. Ukraine’s forces counterattacked in Mykolayiv and the eastern Kharkiv region, an Interior Ministry official said.

Russia’s defence ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov has claimed that Russian forces had taken full control of all territory in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region, the Interfax news agency reported.

In an intelligence update, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) said reports suggest that Russia may seek to stage a ‘referendum’ in Kherson in an attempt to legitimise the area as a ‘breakaway republic’ similar to Donetsk, Luhansk and Crimea.

Thousands have been killed in intense fighting and bombardments since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine on 24 February.

Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, March 14

Mason Clark, George Barros, and Kateryna Stepanenko

March 14, 5:00 pm ET

Russian forces made small territorial gains in Luhansk Oblast on March 14 but did not conduct any major attacks toward Kyiv or in northeastern Ukraine. Russian forces continue to assemble reinforcements and attempt to improve logistical support in both the Kyiv and southern operational directions. Ongoing Russian efforts to replace combat losses with both Russian replacements and non-Russian sources, including Syrian fighters and the Wagner Group, are unlikely to enable Russia to resume major offensive operations within the coming week.

Key Takeaways

Russian forces conducted several limited attacks northwest of Kyiv on March 14, unsuccessfully attempting to bridge the Irpin River.

Russian forces did not conduct offensive operations east of Kyiv and continued to prioritize improving logistics and reinforcing combat units.

The continued ability of Ukrainian forces to carry out successful local counterattacks around Kharkiv indicates that Russian forces are unlikely to successfully bypass Kharkiv from the southeast to advance toward Dnipro and Zaporizhia in the near term.

Russian and proxy forces continue to achieve slow but steady territorial gains in Donetsk Oblast after initial failures in the first week of the Russian invasion.

Ukrainian forces halted resumed Russian attacks from Kherson toward Mykolayiv and Kryvyi Rih on March 14.

Russia will likely deploy small units of Syrian fighters to Ukraine within the week and is confirmed to have deployed private military company (PMC) forces.

Russian and Belarusian forces increased their activity near the Ukrainian border in the last 24 hours in a likely effort to pin down Ukrainian forces but likely do not have the capability to open a new axis of advance into western Ukraine.

Russia and China deny that Russia seeks military aid from China and claimed that Russia does not need additional military support to complete its objectives in Ukraine.

Russia continues to face difficulties replacing combat losses and increasingly seeks to leverage irregular forces including Russian PMCs and Syrian fighters. The Ukrainian General Staff claimed that Russian servicemen are increasingly refusing to travel to Ukraine despite promises of veteran status and higher salaries.[1] The Ukrainian General Staff reported on March 14 that Russia has recruited over a thousand Syrian fighters in “recent days” and that approximately 400 Syrian fighters have arrived in Russia.[2] Russia reportedly established training camps near Rostov (in Russia, directly east of Donbas) and Gomel (in Belarus, north of Kyiv). Senior Lieutenant Sergey Zavadsky of the Russian PMC Wagner Group was confirmed killed in Ukraine on March 13, the first verified Russian PMC casualty since the start of the invasion on February 24.[3]

Russian and Belarusian forces increased their activity near the Ukrainian border in the last 24 hours in a likely effort to pin down Ukrainian forces but likely do not have the capability to open a new axis of advance into western Ukraine. The Ukrainian General Staff reported Russian unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly conducting reconnaissance of settlements near the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in western Ukraine.[4] The General Staff additionally stated that Belarusian forces “strengthened the protection” of the Belarusian-Ukrainian border.[5] It is unclear if the Ukrainian General Staff has observed additional Belarusian forces deploying to the Ukrainian border or if troops already in place are increasing their readiness. ISW cannot independently confirm any additional Belarusian redeployments in the last 48 hours. Social media users observed Russian forces, including Rosgvardia units, deploying to southern Belarus on March 13-14.[6] These forces will likely reinforce existing Russian operations toward Kyiv. Russian and Belarusian forces likely seek to pin Ukrainian forces on the Belarusian border with the threat of new offensive operations, preventing those forces from reinforcing the defense of Kyiv. However, Russian and Belarusian forces remain unlikely to have the capability or intent to open a new axis of advance into western Ukraine at this time.

Russian and Chinese officials both denied US intelligence reports that Russia sought military aid from China. Both claimed that Russia does not need additional military support. Russian and Chinese officials and state media denied US media reports on March 13 that Russia requested military aid from China, calling these reports disinformation.[7] Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov pushed back on the reports and denied that Russia would need any external aid, claiming that ""Russia has an independent potential to continue the operation"" and that Russian operations “will be completed on time and in full.”[8] Chinese state media similarly stated that Russia does not need Chinese help in its “limited-scale” war in Ukraine but emphasized that the United States cannot obligate China to promise not to export arms to Russia.[9] Russia and China likely have discussed possible Chinese military aid to Russia, but both seek to frame Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a limited operation and to avoid acknowledging growing Russian supply issues.

Ukrainian military intelligence reported on March 14 that Russian forces are seizing Ukrainian farming machinery for engineering work, constructing fortifications, and as ad hoc armored vehicles and are forcing Ukrainian civilians to help them.[10] Independent Ukrainian human rights organizations additionally report Russian forces are abducting activists, volunteers, and journalists in several occupied cities, including Kherson, Berdyansk, and Melitopol.[11]

Russian forces are engaged in four primary efforts at this time:

Main effort—Kyiv (comprised of three subordinate supporting efforts);

Supporting effort 1—Kharkiv; Supporting effort 1a—Luhansk Oblast;

Supporting effort 2—Mariupol and Donetsk Oblast; and

Supporting effort 3—Kherson and advances westward.

Main effort—Kyiv axis: Russian operations on the Kyiv axis are aimed at encircling the city from the northwest, west, and east.

Russian forces conducted several limited attacks northwest of Kyiv on March 14, unsuccessfully attempting to bridge the Irpin River. Russian forces did not conduct offensive operations east of Kyiv and continued to prioritize improving logistics and reinforcing combat units. Russian forces may not be able to concentrate the combat power necessary to resume major offensive operations toward Kyiv within the week, despite several operational pauses to reconstitute forces.

Subordinate main effort along the west bank of the Dnipro

Russian forces launched several unsuccessful assaults against Irpin and Bucha on March 13-14, attempting to cross the Irpin River.[12] Russian VDV (Airborne) forces supported by engineers unsuccessfully attempted to establish a pontoon bridge over the Irpin river.[13] The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian forces primarily continued to restore combat capability, regroup their troops, and improve logistics and have not resumed large-scale offensive operations, despite the limited attacks in Irpin and Bucha.[14] Russian forces have not conducted any major attacks on northwestern Kyiv since March 9.

Putin-appointed strongman leader of the Chechen Republic Ramzan Kadyrov claimed on Telegram to have traveled to the northwestern Kyiv suburb of Hostomel to meet with Chechen forces on March 13.[15] ISW cannot verify Kadyrov’s video and claimed travel to Ukraine, though Chechen forces are confirmed to be participating in Russian efforts to encircle Kyiv from the west. Kadyrov likely seeks to increase the morale of Chechen troops that have reportedly suffered heavy losses in Ukraine, regardless of the veracity of his video.

Subordinate supporting effort—Chernihiv and Sumy axis

Russian forces did not conduct any offensive operations toward the eastern Kyiv suburb of Brovary or against Chernihiv in the last 24 hours.[16] The Ukrainian General Staff reported Russian forces northeast of Kyiv “moved to the defense” in the last 24 hours and focused on replenishing supplies and conducting reconnaissance.[17] Russian forces likely intend to reinforce their exposed line of communication in northeastern Ukraine against counterattacks prior to resuming offensive operations toward northeastern Kyiv.

Supporting Effort #1—Kharkiv:

Ukrainian forces repelled Russian forces around Izyum (southeast of Kharkiv) late on March 13, repelling Russian attacks near several villages, including Topolske, Shpakivka, and Donetske.[18] The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian forces conducted several attacks to reclaim the territory throughout March 14, with fighting ongoing as of 6:00 pm local time on March 14.[19] Russian forces did not conduct any offensive operations in or around Kharkiv in the past 24 hours and continued to shell the city.[20] The continued ability of Ukrainian forces to carry out successful local counterattacks indicates that Russian forces are unlikely to successfully bypass Kharkiv from the southeast to advance toward Dnipro and Zaporizhia in the near term.

Supporting Effort #1a—Luhansk Oblast:

Russian forces conducted several unsuccessful attacks on Severodonetsk late on March 13.[21] Ukrainian authorities reported Russian forces shelled the town of Popasnaya with prohibited incendiary rockets on March 12-13.[22]

Supporting Effort #2—Mariupol and Donetsk Oblast:

Russian forces conducted several assaults on eastern Mariupol on March 13-14.[23] Russian artillery continued to shell the city and its northern outskirts, and Russian aircraft are increasingly conducting close-air-support missions near the city.[24] Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov claimed 5,000 Chechen soldiers are fighting near Mariupol on March 14. Social media users on the ground confirmed the presence of Chechen fighters.[25]

Russian and proxy forces continue to achieve slow but steady territorial gains in Donetsk Oblast after initial failures in the first week of the Russian invasion. The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed Russian forces have advanced 15-17km from the pre-invasion line of contact in Donetsk Oblast as of March 14.[26] The Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) additionally announced a list of 90 settlements it claims to have captured as of March 14.[27] Russian and proxy forces likely seek to advance toward Zaporizhya and mitigate the possibility of any Ukrainian attempts to relieve Mariupol or attempts by its defenders to break out.

Supporting Effort #3—Kherson and west:

The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces halted resumed Russian attacks from Kherson toward Mykolayiv and Kryvyi Rih on March 14.[28] Russian forces have not abandoned their effort to encircle Mykolayiv.[29] The Ukrainian Border Guard found three dead Russian soldiers in Mykolayiv while patrolling the area of a possible Russian airborne landing on March 14 and stated they believe these three servicemen were left behind by their own detachment.[30] Russian forces may intend to advance toward Kryvyi Rih to encircle Zaporizhya but are unlikely to have the forces necessary to do so while Russian forces in the south remain committed to the encirclement of Mariupol.

Immediate items to watch

The Kremlin likely seeks to pressure Belarus to join the war in Ukraine and will deploy Syrian fighters to Ukraine in the near future.

Ukrainian counterattacks and operations by Territorial Defense Forces in northeastern Ukraine threaten Russia’s exposed line of communicating, requiring Russia to redeploy forces away from the offensive towards eastern Kyiv.

Russian forces are undertaking another operational pause to prepare for renewed efforts to encircle Kyiv from east and west and/or to seize the city center itself following their failures of March 8-9.

Russian troops may drive on Zaporizhya City itself within the next 48-72 hours, likely attempting to block it on both banks of the Dnipro River and set conditions for subsequent operations after Russian forces take Mariupol, which they are currently besieging.

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

20:47 Latvian President Egils Levits said a permanent NATO military base in Latvia is “absolutely necessary” to protect the country from any potential Russian aggression.

I also welcome the US troops in Poland and the Baltics, and we need the continued presence of US troops in the area. I think this is a response to Russian ideas about aggression outside of Ukraine,” Levits said on CNN.

W związku z atakiem Rosji na Ukrainę i częściowym odwróceniem uwagi zachodniego świata od Dalekiego Wschodu pojawiły się obawy, że Chiny mogą wykorzystać tę sytuację do agresji na Tajwan, który Pekin uznaje za zbuntowaną prowincję. Z drugiej strony, są głosy, że opór Ukraińców, trudności Rosjan z podbiciem sąsiedniego kraju oraz reakcje na inwazję mogą być dla Chin swoistym ostrzeżeniem.

Reakcja Zachodu korzystna dla Tajwanu

Prof. Michał Lubina przyznał, że podziela te opinie. W jego opinii jedność Zachodu, która ""z naszej perspektywy nie wygląda aż na taką wielką"", z perspektywy chińskiej jest czymś, czego nie było od 1991 roku. Taka sytuacja ""pomaga Tajwanowi"".

- Skoro Zachód był w stanie tak się zjednoczyć w przypadku Ukrainy, to będzie w stanie to zrobić w przypadku Tajwanu, który odpowiada za 47 proc. produkcji światowych półprzewodników. To jest istotne - stwierdził pracownik Instytutu Bliskiego i Dalekiego Wschodu UJ.

Ryzyka dla Chin

- To oddala ewentualną inwazję - kontynuował gość Polskiego Radia 24. Wskazał również na ""strukturalne powody, które sprawiają, że inwazja na Tajwan nie była prawdopodobna nawet przed atakiem na Ukrainę"". Wymienił kilka głównych powodów: brak przygotowania chińskiej armii na taką operację, niesprzyjające warunki pogodowe (""tylko trzy miesiące w roku, kiedy jest »okienko pogodowe«"" do przeprowadzenia agresji) oraz ryzyko związane z przeprowadzaniem takiej operacji przez nadchodzącym XX Zjazdem Komunistycznej Partii Chin.

Prof. Lubina wskazał też na ""element kulturowy"", którego ""nie należy całkiem ignorować"". - To nie jest w chińskim stylu, by dokonywać inwazji. Lepiej coś zrobić pokojowo, szantażem czy gospodarczo. To minimalizuje ryzyka - podkreślił.

Wojny nie będzie, ale incydenty się pojawią

Do tych ""stałych strukturalnych elementów"" dochodzi ""wielkie zjednoczenie Zachodu"", co zniechęca Pekin do ataku. Nie zmienia to faktu, tłumaczył ekspert, że pojawiać się będą kolejne incydenty, jak odnotowywane już wlatywanie chińskich samolotów w tajwańską przestrzeń powietrzną. - W najgorszym razie mogą być próby jakiejś eskalacji na wysepkach należących do Tajwanu - stwierdził.

- Zasadniczo to jest na stole, natomiast samej operacji inwazji na Tajwan bym się teraz nie spodziewał - podsumował. Zastrzegł, że to ""racjonalna interpretacja"" sytuacji na Dalekim Wschodzie. - Jak zadziałają przywódcy? Tego nie wiemy - skwitował.

Chad Blackard was booked in connection to the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Karrington Smith, according to Casey Hicks, a spokeswoman with the East Baton Rouge Sheriff’s Office. He faces several charges, including negligent homicide, third-degree feticide and illegal use of weapons.

Arrest records show deputies were dispatched just after 6 p.m. Saturday to the 6100 block of Siegen Lane in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, WAFB reports.

Smith, who was 25 weeks pregnant, was taken to a local hospital, where she and her unborn child later died.

After questioning, deputies learned Blackard was allegedly “playing with the handgun” when it discharged. Blackard told deputies when he tried to reposition the gun, it “went off.”

According to EBRSO, Blackard later stated he squeezed the trigger while readjusting the weapon.

A man in the backseat, Chad Blackard, 23, had been “playing with the handgun” when it discharged, according to an incident report obtained by Inside Edition Digital.

“While performing life-saving measures, the medical staff learned that the victim was approximately … [25] weeks pregnant,” authorities with the East Baton Rouge Sheriff Office said. “The victim and her fetus were pronounced deceased at the hospital.”

Before she succumbed to her injuries, Smith allegedly attempted to tell authorities that she was the one who shot the gun, The Advocate reported. Authorities, however, later determined that Blackard was the one who discharged the weapon.

Blackard had apparently been bragging about “how his gun outperforms the gun owned by” someone else in the car, according to the incident report.

The report went on to say that Blackard told detectives “he may have accidentally removed a portion of the gun from the holster and squeezed the trigger while he was readjusting it.”

Blackard's mom insisted the shooting was an accident. ""It was a tragic accident. My son is a great young man. Never been in trouble,"" she wrote on Facebook. ""My son was crying and trying to save her and he also cried... telling me he didn’t mean to and it was an accident.""

Smith, who sometimes went by Jade, was a junior firefighter for the Pine Grove Volunteer Fire Department, according to a Facebook post.

She announced in a Facebook post that she was pregnant in early December, posting a sweet photo of a sonogram and onesie with the words “June 2022” with her partner. They had planned to name their baby Dallas.

Smith's loved ones are now raising money for her funeral expenses through a GoFundMe page.

""Jade always brought light into any situation and I have never seen her without a smile on her face,"" the organizer of the page wrote.

A donor who noted she was Smith's aunt commented, ""R.I.P Jade Smith and baby Dallas.. Your Angels are waiting. As you fly high with other side of Family you let them know we miss each and everyone.. Kiss them for me.""

Blackard is currently being held in jail on charges of negligent homicide, third-degree feticide and illegal use of a weapon. He does not yet have a court date listed.

The Advocate, citing an affidavit, reported that Blackard bragged that his gun ""outperforms"" a gun owned by another passenger before it discharged.

The newspaper reported that before Smith died, she initially told deputies that the gun had accidentally fired while in her purse, but the sheriff's office later determined Blackard was responsible.

The incident marks the second time this week that a woman was killed inside a car by accidental gunfire. Police in suburban Chicago said a 3-year-old boy accidentally shot his mother to death as the family was sitting in their car in a supermarket parking lot on Saturday.

Chad Blackard, 23, stands accused of negligent homicide, feticide in the third degree and illegal use of weapons over the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Karrington Smith on Saturday night in Baton Rouge, La.

According to the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff’s Office, the incident occurred just after 6 p.m. on the day in question while the defendant and the deceased were traveling together in the same car. Blackard was in the back seat directly behind Smith, who was sitting in the front passenger seat.

At one point, according to an arrest affidavit obtained by The Advocate, the defendant retrieved his gun and hung it on the seat where Smith was sitting. This display reportedly led to a conversation about firearms. Blackard, eventually, came to boast about how his gun “outperforms” a gun that is owned by another passenger in the car.

While bragging, the defendant reached for and attempted to reposition the gun when it went off, the affidavit alleges. The bullet traveled through the passenger seat and struck Smith in her back.

The driver of the car then pulled into a business parking lot and called 911. First responders arrived and transported Smith to a nearby hospital where she was first reportedly in critical condition. Eventually, however, Smith and her baby were both pronounced dead.

Deputies arrived to find Smith still alive. During a brief conversation with law enforcement, the dying woman may have tried to shield her killer from the legal consequences of the unfortunate incident.

According to an initial report by The Advocate, Smith told police her gun “accidentally discharged” while it was inside her purse, citing the EBRSO. A similar report by local ABC affiliate WBRZ says the woman “suggested the gun was in her purse when it went off.”

But after some investigation, deputies reached a different conclusion.

Law enforcement questioned Blackard and later attributed the tragic incident to the defendant “playing with the handgun,” according to arrest records cited by local CBS affiliate WAFB.

Blackard allegedly told deputies he was trying to reposition his unidentified semi-automatic when it “went off” and also later allegedly said he might have squeezed the trigger while “readjusting it.”

The defendant is currently being detained in the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison. His bond for the illegal use of a weapon charge is set at $80,000. No bond has been set for the other two charges.

The victim was 25 weeks pregnant at the time.

She had apparently named her child-to-be in advance of the birth.

“[I] have no words to say,” her friend Haley Clayton wrote in a Facebook post on Sunday . “[I] love you more than words can ever say you were my sister from another mister. as i sit here and try to process all of this you and little dallas layne were my whole world my everything yall were my heart outside of my body.”

“[I] remember like it was yesterday when you called me and said i was gonna be an aunt i was so happy,” the post continued. “[I] tried to save you i tried so hard. you and little dallas watch over all of us.”

123,ce6db68f-bbaa-4db1-ba11-0b3f6e25b677,[],,"Introduction

Since 24 February 2022 Belarus has been an active enabler of Russia’s war against Ukraine. The present Brief (1) examines the background to this and analyses how military cooperation between Russia and Belarus has developed since 2020 (2). Back then, following the brutal crackdown on the protests contesting the results of the fraudulent presidential elections, Belarus became almost completely isolated from the West. As a result, Minsk’s dependence on Russia increased substantially, because political, security, logistical and financial support from Russia became vital for the survival of Lukashenka’s regime.

The Brief is composed of four main parts. The first section provides an overview of the main characteristics of Russia-Belarus military cooperation before the events of 2020. The second part charts the most important changes that have taken place in the last one and a half years, focusing on the increasingly frequent joint exercises and operations held by the Russian and Belarusian armed forces, the stationing of Russian troops in Belarus, and the deployment of Belarusian soldiers in Russian-led missions abroad, as well as the war against Ukraine. The third section forecasts the future development of bilateral military cooperation between Moscow and Minsk, while the last section considers the implications both for the European Union and the Eastern Partnership region.

Military cooperation before 2020

Institutionalised cooperation

Russia and Belarus have been military allies ever since Alexander Lukashenka came to power in 1994. There are four different institutional layers of military cooperation between Moscow and Minsk, comprising two multilateral and two bilateral dimensions. Concerning the first, cooperation in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) focuses mostly on regulatory activities (3), as well as field and combat training, including regular live-fire exercises held in Russia (4). The second, strategically and operationally more important framework is the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO). Established in 2002, the organisation has been slowly but steadily developing its institutional frameworks as well as crisis management capabilities. The CSTO has five different types of joint forces, one of which is the Russia-Belarus CSTO Eastern European Group of Forces (5). However, CSTO forces have never been deployed in a real-life combat operation due to a lack of unified political will, as well as Russia’s reluctance to deploy CSTO troops. The organisation remained on the sidelines during the Kyrgyz crises of 2005 and 2010, as well as during the 2016 and 2020 wars between Azerbaijan and Armenia, and even during the Tajik-Kyrgyz border crisis in 2021, when two CSTO members fought each other. The reluctance of Belarus to commit its soldiers to any missions abroad, stemming from the country’s traumatic experiences during the Soviet-Afghan war (6), accounted in no small degree for the CSTO’s inaction, as did Lukashenka’s fears that the CSTO might turn into an instrument for Russian intervention that could also one day be used against him.

Bilateral frameworks of military cooperation between Moscow and Minsk are close and multi-faceted. This is primarily due to the fact that the territory of Belarus is of crucial importance to the Kremlin for defending Federation, including the exclave of Kaliningrad. One of the frameworks, the so-called Union State of Russia and Belarus, is a unique bilateral organisation, established in 1999, which has a well-developed defence policy component. In fact, Belarus has been the main beneficiary of cooperation in the framework of the Union State, as Moscow has provided it with a viable security and defence guarantee: Russian strategic documents keep emphasising that Moscow considers any armed aggression against the Union State as an aggression against Russia (7). Similarly, the military doctrine of Belarus, adopted in 2016, puts key emphasis on military cooperation with Russia and joint defence of the Union State. (8)

Military cooperation within the Union State includes joint defence policy, harmonisation of joint military activities, joint use of military infrastructure, coordination in military construction, coordinated border policy and a number of other issues (9). The Union State adopted its first military doctrine in 2001 (10), replaced by a new one in 2018.

Belarus is of crucial importance to the Kremlin for defending the territory and airspace of the Russian Federation.

In addition to this, there are a series of bilateral defence-related agreements between the two countries, which are outside the frameworks of the Union State. The most important ones concern the Regional Grouping of Forces of Russia and Belarus, established in January 1998, (11) and the Unified Air Defence System (12). In the framework of the former, should an attack occur, the two countries commit to jointly set up the Regional Grouping of Forces, (13) an army-sized, combined arms formation composed of the entirety of Belarus’s armed forces, as well as various Russian units, including Russia’s 1st Guards Tank Army. (14). The regular Union Shield exercises are held to practise various aspects of this very scenario. Regarding the latter, since 2016 the air defence systems of Russia and Belarus have been functioning in a fully integrated way. In the event of an armed attack, the joint system will be commanded by Russia. (15)

Exercises and military presence

Despite the multi-layered, established institutional frameworks, before 2020 Lukashenka had consistently resisted pressure from Moscow to further deepen military cooperation between the two countries, particularly if it would have restrained Minsk’s room for manoeuvre in foreign policy.

This stance was particularly visible in the context of the military exercises. For a long time Belarusian forces have regularly participated in joint military exercises with Russia. The largest ones are the quadrennial Zapad (West) strategic exercises conducted in Russia’s Western Military District, held since 1999. The key premise of the Zapad-2017 exercise was to test how Belarus could host Russian military forces, should an external attack necessitate such a deployment. During the Zapad-2017 drills Russia tried to increase the pre-agreed deployment numbers shortly before the launch of the exercise, but Minsk firmly refused. Furthermore, Belarus invited Western observers to the exercise, both to ensure transparency and also to exclude a scenario whereby Russia could use the manoeuvre to cover an invasion of Belarus.

In terms of military infrastructure, Russia has two military installations on the territory of Belarus, both inherited from Soviet times. A navy communication transmission station, used to communicate with submarines, operates at the town of Vileyka, and a long-range radar station, part of Russia’s early warning system, is located near Baranovichi. Russia operates both facilities officially on a lease basis, but free of charge (16). According to Russian and Belarusian military terminology, neither of these two installations qualify as a military base (voennaya baza); instead, they are ‘military objects’ (voenniy obyekt).

Before 2020 Lukashenka had consistently resisted pressure from Moscow to further deepen military cooperation between the two countries.

Russia has long been pushing Belarus to host a permanent Russian military base too. However, until 2021 Lukashenka resisted this pressure, because a Russian base on Belarusian territory would have considerably reduced his leeway in foreign policy vis-à-vis the West. Besides, in the post-2014 context a Russian base would have constituted a major point of contention in Minsk’s relations with Ukraine too. In December 2014 Lukashenka explicitly pledged that ‘Belarus would never allow other countries to use Belarus’ territory for military intervention in Ukraine’ (17). Although between 2013 and 2016 Russia stationed a number of Sukhoi Su-27 fighters on Belarusian airfields, these jets were not there as part of any military base, but solely as a temporary boost to Belarus’s own, ageing air defence fighters (18). Minsk’s resistance was so effective that when NATO established its Enhanced Forward Presence in the Baltic States and Poland in 2016, Russia exempted Belarusian territory from the military build-up that it undertook in reaction to NATO’s eastward expansion and the military reinforcements took place only on Russian territory, including Kaliningrad (19).

Military-industrial complex dependencies

In addition to all these aspects, there are also extensive defence industrial ties between Russia and Belarus, creating a predominantly asymmetric, but still somewhat interdependent relationship between Moscow and Minsk. On the one hand, Belarus is completely dependent on Russia both as a supplier of military hardware and also as the main market for the Belarusian military industry. On the other hand, there are a number of Belarusian-manufactured military products that Russia cannot produce on its own, thus it is still dependent on Belarus for certain items of military equipment. These include, besides sensors and opto-electronic equipment, most importantly wheeled chassis produced by the Minsk Wheeled Tractor Plant (MZKT), which serve as platforms for Russia’s Topol-M (20) and RS-24 Yars missiles (21), as well as for some versions of air defence systems. Trucks and tractor-trailers produced by another Belarusian automotive factory, the Minsk Automobile Plant (MAZ), are also essential for several Russian weapon systems, including the Iskander-M missiles and S-400 air defence systems. Although Russia has made several efforts to reduce the dependency of its strategic nuclear forces on Belarusian-manufactured chassis (22), so far the Russian automotive industry has not succeeded in producing a suitable replacement in satisfactory numbers (23). Russia’s takeover or merger efforts to gain control over these Belarusian companies were also unsuccessful. Hence, Russia’s dependence on certain Belarusian military industrial products is likely to continue.

Changes since 2020

Since the crackdown on the protests that followed the presidential elections in August 2020 and the subsequent isolation of Belarus from the West, substantial changes have taken place also in the field of military cooperation between Russia and Belarus.

End of the policy of situational neutrality

Even the ongoing transformation of the Belarusian political system, reflected in the constitutional reform, has a military-related dimension. This is particularly so because the new, amended constitution (24), which was adopted in a referendum held on 27 February 2022, contains an important change compared to the previous Belarusian constitution, which stipulated that the country pledges to be a nuclear-free zone, and that the state had to be neutral (25). This neutrality has long been interpreted in a very flexible way, as Belarus has been a member of the Collective Security Treaty of the CIS, and thereafter the CSTO, since 1994.

Moreover, as described above, Minsk has had a long-standing military alliance with Russia ever since the breakup of the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, in 2014 Minsk took a neutral stance on the crisis in Ukraine; it did not recognise Russia’s illegal annexation of the Crimea and offered its territory as a site for conflict settlement negotiation over the Donbas (26). Indeed Belarus even appeared to be somewhat favourably disposed towards Ukraine: Minsk supplied diesel fuel to Ukraine and maintained military-industrial cooperation too. In other words, this neutrality was situational (27) rather than institutional, but until 2020 it existed at least officially. Hence, it is noteworthy that the new constitution removes both the requirement of nuclear-free status and of neutrality (28). The text was adopted following a referendum held on 27 February 2022 (29), so this date marks the official end of Belarusian neutrality.

Russian military presence in Belarus

After years of resisting the presence of Russian combat troops in Belarus, in March 2021 Lukashenka finally agreed to the presence of a joint Belarusian-Russian military unit in Belarus. This is the Joint Air Defence and Air Force Training and Combat Centre, located in the Grodno region, to which Lukashenka agreed Su-30SM fighters (31). Although this centre does not qualify as a fully-fledged military base, it contains combat-capable Russian weapons (including at least two S-400 launchers) now deployed to Belarus. The training centre already participated in the Union Resolve 2022 exercise (see below).

In addition to the training centre, from September 2021 Russian fighter jets again started patrolling Belarusian airspace, departing from Baranovichi airport, together with their Belarusian counterparts, with both flying modern Sukhoi Su-30SM multi-purpose fighters. Belarus was delivered its first Sukhoi-30s in 2019, in order to gradually replace its ageing fleet of MiG-29s (32), but so far Minsk has only received a handful of them. Hence, joint patrolling of Belarusian airspace, as well as conducting training missions (33), is not only a political gesture, but also a military necessity amidst the current, heightened tensions between Russia, Belarus and the West. Russian Sukhoi-30s operate from Belarus on a rotational basis, so their presence does not equate to the establishment of a military base either. Nevertheless, the fact that Russia has now two combat-capable units in Belarus, albeit jointly operated ones, is a significant change compared to the pre-2020 era.

Russian military manoeuvres in Belarus

Since 2020 joint military maneouvres on Belarusian soil have increased significantly both in number and in scale. Lukashenka appears to have overcome his earlier reluctance to engage in close military cooperation with Russia, indicating his growing dependence on Moscow. On 1 September 2021 Lukashenka openly declared that Russia and Belarus practically have ‘a single army’, and should a war start, they would fight jointly (34). A month later, on 2 October 2021 he even went further and said that Belarus could become ‘a joint military base with Russia’ in case of an external attack (35). His remarks demonstrated that the increasingly close military cooperation between Moscow and Minsk has political support from the highest level.

Four years after the previous such exercise, in 2021 Russia held another Zapad strategic exercise, together with Belarus. Like its predecessor, Zapad-2021 lasted a lot longer and involved significantly more Russian forces than officially indicated (36).

From the perspective of Russia-Belarus cooperation there were plenty of differences. Most importantly, in contrast to his reticence in 2017, in 2021 Lukashenka fully supported the exercise and the hosting of larger Russian formations (37). He did not seem to object to the threats it could potentially pose to Belarus’s Western neighbours, nor did he invite any observers from the West (38).

Instead, he declared during the exercise (39) that in the coming years he expects to receive arms from Russia worth USD 1 billion, which would include the delivery of S-400 air defence systems too.

Russia also dispatched military forces to Belarus in the summer and autumn of 2021, so during the migrant crisis on Europe’s borders unleashed by Lukashenka in an effort to destabilise Poland, Lithuania and, to a lesser extent, Latvia. Somewhat unusually in a migration-related context, instead of sending border guards or humanitarian personnel, Russia conducted a number of demonstrative flights by nuclear-capable strategic bombers in Belarusian airspace in November-December 2021 (40). The Tu-160 and Tupolev Tu-22M3 strategic bombers were accompanied by jet fighters that Russia had supplied to the Belarusian air force. Belarusian and Russian Sukhoi-30 fighter jets also conducted joint air patrols along the Polish border (41). There was also an unannounced joint Russia-Belarus paratrooper exercise held in November 2021 close to the border with Poland.

The occasional presence of Russian bombers or paratroopers in Belarus would not have been much of a novelty. (42) However, Russia’s military getting so directly involved in Belarus’s disputes with the West was a phenomenon unseen before 2020.

The deployment to Kazakhstan marked a departure from Belarus’s decades-long reluctance to commit its soldiers to military missions abroad.

The deployment of Belarusian forces in the first CSTO ‘peacekeeping’ mission also needs to be mentioned (43). Belarus contributed to the operation by deploying soldiers from its Vitebsk-based 103rd Airborne Special Operations Brigade (44), who were airlifted to Kazakhstan by the Russian air force. Belarus responded so quickly to the decision of the CSTO Collective Security Council on 6 January that Belarusian troops were airlifted out of the country already on the same night and started operating in Kazakhstan next day (45). On the one hand, the operation again demonstrated the very high level of interoperability between Russian and Belarusian forces. On the other hand, it abruptly marked a departure from Belarus’s decades-long reluctance to deploy its soldiers in military missions abroad. As Belarus has clearly not forgotten the trauma of Afghanistan, most probably the reason that Minsk agreed to supply troops is that Lukashenka is no longer in a position to obstruct the Kremlin’s ambition to use the CSTO as an instrument to advance its own strategic objectives.

The 'Union Resolve 2022' exercise

On 17 January 2022 Russia and Belarus announced that major, joint military drills were going to take place in Belarus between 10 and 20 February 2022, in the framework of the Union State. The exercise, named ‘Union Resolve 2022’ (Soyuznaya reshimost’ 2022) was intended to practise repelling an external attack from the western and southern directions. Hence, this manoeuvre, unlike Zapad-2021, already implied Ukraine as a source of potential aggression.

Russia moved sizeable forces to Belarus, amounting to several thousand soldiers, constituting the largest-ever Russian deployment of troops and weaponry to the country, including Iskander missiles, S-400 air defence systems, dozens of T-72B3 tanks, BM-27 Uragan multiple-launch rocket systems, engineering vehicles and plenty of other heavy equipment. Although the ‘Union Resolve 2022’ exercise officially ended on 20 February, Russian forces remained in the country after that deadline (46).

Belarus in the war against Ukraine

Russia escalated the limited war it has been conducting against Ukraine since 2014 into a full-scale invasion on 24 February 2022. Belarus has played a key and active role in Russia’s attack from the very beginning, due to a number of reasons. First and foremost, Russia has used the territory and infrastructure of Belarus as a military platform for its war against Ukraine, by operating the troops it had deployed in the framework of the ‘Union Resolve’ exercise. A major Russian offensive against Kyiv has been launched from south-east Belarus. Russian bombers depart from Belarus’s Baranovichi and Lida airfields, and Russia is also operating a Beriev A-50 airborne early warning and control (AEW-C) aircraft from there to coordinate its air operations in Ukraine (47). Russia has fired several ground-to-ground missiles from Belarusian territory and also launched artillery strikes from there. In addition to all this, Belarusian armed forces are providing the advancing Russian army with full logistical and military medical support.

While at the time of writing it is yet unclear whether Minsk has also deployed combat troops to Ukraine, the enabling role Belarus has been playing in Russia’s war clearly makes the country an integral part of the conflict. Somewhat paradoxically, Belarus’s new constitution, which abolished the country’s neutrality, was adopted only on 27 February, thus three days after its neutrality de facto ceased to exist due to Belarus’s active participation in Russia’s war against Ukraine.

Likely future trends of Russia-Belarus military cooperation

The deepening of military cooperation between Russia and Belarus is an open-ended project. Several more exercises and unannounced rapid deployments of Russian forces are likely to take place, both in order to further improve interoperability (48) and also to put pressure on the West, in the same way as happened in the autumn of 2021.It is unlikely that Russia will give up its long-standing plan to establish a fully-fledged military base in Belarus either. Meanwhile, if forces deployed as part of the Union Resolve-2022 exercise and now in the war against Ukraine remain in Belarus, either fully or partially, this will constitute a de facto lasting and indefinite Russian military presence in Belarus, despite the official absence of a permanent military base. Further transfer of military hardware is also highly likely, particularly taking into account the obsolete equipment of most Belarusian units, and especially of the air force.

While exploiting Belarus’s growing dependence on Russia, Moscow will probably keep striving to reduce its dependence on Belarus-manufactured military hardware, concerning particularly the Strategic

The intensifying Russian-Belarusian military cooperation has serious regional implications. Regarding the EU and NATO, the presence of Russia’s S-400 air defence missiles in the Grodno region, close to the Polish border, means a considerable extension of Russia’s ability to cover the airspace of parts of Poland and Lithuania, and thus deny air traffic there in the event of an armed conflict against NATO. As soon as Belarus receives its own S-400s, this threat is going to grow further. It is also highly likely that Russia will deploy significant signal intelligence and electronic warfare capabilities to Belarus.

Moreover, the more Russian land forces are present in Belarus and the faster further units can be deployed to the country, the possibility of Russia closing the Suwalki Gap becomes a more plausible scenario (49). Lithuania openly considers the presence of Russian troops in Belarus as a threat (50).

In addition to all these elements, based on the success of the deployment of Rapid Reaction Forces to Kazakhstan in January 2022, it is highly likely that CSTO will be more active in addressing future potential crises in its area of operation. By doing so, it may well serve as a conduit for Russia to strengthen and solidify its influence over the CSTO member states, including Belarus.

Last, but not least, the growing dependence of Belarus on Russia will also affect the EU’s Eastern Partnership initiative vis-à-vis both Belarus and the wider region. As was demonstrated already in 2020, Russia is ready to step up against any political movement that would endanger its strategic positions and interests in Belarus.The deepening bilateral military cooperation provides additional motivation for this, as well as tools and means to interfere in Belarus’s domestic affairs, if necessary. In other words, the closer the military cooperation between Moscow and Minsk becomes, the lower will be the chances of the Belarusian democratic opposition having a meaningful influence on how the domestic political situation in the country evolves.

Closer military cooperation between Russia and Belarus is likely to also affect the wider Eastern Partnership region.

Closer military cooperation between Russia and Belarus is likely to also affect the wider Eastern Partnership region. The more successful Russia is in employing its military forces to achieve political gains, the weaker the soft power-based influence of the EU may become. This will be particularly the case now that Russia has attacked Ukraine, because the war demonstrates both the inability of the EU and NATO to directly outmatch Russia’s military might, and their unwillingness to risk a confrontation with Russia.

Conclusions

As of early 2022, Belarus has become a closer military ally of Russia than it has ever been. Although Russia still does not have a permanent military base on Belarusian soil, the presence of Russian combat-capable forces on Belarusian territory is already established. The interoperability of Russian and Belarusian forces is constantly improving, and, as demonstrated both by the Zapad-2021 exercise and by the CSTO deployment to Kazakhstan, is already at a very high level. Lukashenka has not only backtracked on his earlier reluctance to allow Belarusian territory to be used as a launching pad for an attack against Ukraine, but since 24 February 2022 Belarus has been taking an active part in the war. Moreover, the growing Russian military presence in Belarus constitutes a threat also to the EU and NATO, but this is no longer a matter of concern for Minsk, in contrast to its attitude prior to 2020.

Russia’s growing military influence over Belarus, including the likely stationing of Russian forces, will negatively affect the security of the whole region. This is particularly true regarding the possibility of Russian nuclear-capable weapon systems, such as Iskander-missiles deployed in Belarus. Russian military presence will inevitably further weaken the already very limited possibilities of the EU’s Eastern Partnership initiative in the country. It will also increase pressure on the Baltic States and Poland by considerably shortening the available reaction time in the event of any NATO-Russia confrontation. Moreover, the stationing of Russian forces will enable Moscow to considerably strengthen its intelligence and anti-access and area denial (A2AD) capabilities.

The deepening of military cooperation is unlikely to be reversed. Instead, Belarus is apparently on the way to becoming a de facto extension of Russia’s Western Military District. Hence, all in all, the official removal of neutrality from the new constitution of Belarus is only rubberstamping a reality that Belarus has been rapidly heading towards since 2020, and that has now materialised violently and dramatically following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Summary ICRC warns about situation in Mariupol

First evacuation convoy allowed to leave on Monday

Ukraine says more were evacuated on Tuesday

LVIV, Ukraine, March 15 (Reuters) - Ukraine accused Russia on Tuesday of blocking a convoy trying to take supplies to the besieged city of Mariupol, where the Red Cross said desperate families were being ""suffocated"" as food and water ran out.

Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said hundreds of civilians managed to leave Mariupol in cars for the second successive day, but the aid convoy trying to reach the port city was stuck at nearby Berdyansk as Russian shelling continued.

""Our side ensures a complete ceasefire,"" she said. ""Russia, as usual, is cynically lying, thinking that people and the world do not see it and do not understand.""

Russia did not immediately comment on the situation around Mariupol. It denies targeting civilians and has blamed Ukraine for the repeated failure to establish safe passage for civilians and humanitarian convoys since it invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.

Mariupol residents have been without heating, electricity and running water for most of the past two weeks, and at least 200,000 are in urgent need of evacuation, according to official Ukrainian estimates.

Vereshchuk said the majority of residents do not have cars, so there was a need for buses to reach the city in convoys so that they can be evacuated.

Residents are ""essentially being suffocated in this city now with no aid,"" Ewan Watson, spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), told a U.N. briefing in Geneva. read more

The ICRC said on Twitter that ""tens of thousands of families are living under the constant threat of danger"" in Mariupol.

""They’re huddled in whatever shelter they can find. They have limited food and water. They’re terrified,"" it said.

Russian forces agreed on Monday to allow the creation of a humanitarian corridor out of Mariupol. The first evacuation convoy then left, after more than a week of failed attempts to do so, but Ukrainian officials were unable to deliver any aid.

About 300 civilians had by Tuesday morning reached the city of Zaporizhzhia, about 225 km (140 miles) from Mariupol, the Mariupol city council said.

By early afternoon on Tuesday, about 2,000 cars had left Mariupol and a further 2,000 were waiting to leave, it said.

More than 2,500 Mariupol residents have been killed since the Russian invasion, a Ukrainian official said on Monday. Reuters was unable to verify the toll.

Officials in Moscow describe Russia's offensive in Ukraine as a special military operation to disarm the country and prevent ""genocide"" against Russian-speakers, a justification dismissed by Ukraine and the West as a false and illegal pretext for an invasion of a democratic country.

LVIV, Ukraine, March 15 (Reuters) - Ukraine faced new problems trying to deliver humanitarian aid to the besieged city of Mariupol on Tuesday, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said.

According to the official, Lapid's bureau tried to plan a call, but that Kuleba has not yet agreed to do so. ""He didn't say 'no,' he said that he was busy,"" the source said. He added that the last phone call between the two foreign ministers took place three months ago, long before the Russian invasion.

The official said that Lapid has not yet accepted an invitation to visit Kyiv, which was extended by Ukraine's deputy foreign minister about two weeks before the war.

An Israeli political source believes that the two will indeed speak in the coming days.

Lapid is the highest-ranking Israeli official to criticize the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and has done so at least four times in public declarations.

On Sunday, he took a more severe tone during a visit to Ukraine, saying that ""Israel, like Romania, condemns the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It is unjustifiable and we call on Russia to cease its fire and aggression and to solve its problems at the negotiating table.""

The Take podcast: Is Russia’s Syria playbook being used in Ukraine?

What can 11 years of war in Syria tell us about Ukraine? This week marks the anniversary of Syria’s uprising and there still seems to be no end to conflict in sight.

There’s also another date that resonates: September 30, 2015, when Russia intervened on behalf of President Bashar al-Assad’s government.

Russia said it tested at least 320 new types of weapons in Syria, some of which are now in use in the war in Ukraine, and it is using tactics that seem to come from what has been called the “Syria playbook”.

We look at how the people all too familiar with that playbook see Syria’s story in Ukraine.

The lender added that if the conflict is prolonged, the situation will worsen. Citing wartime data for conflicts in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen, it predicted the “annual output contraction could eventually be much higher, in the range of 25 to 35 percent.”

Russian troops focus efforts on capital Kyiv

Russian troops have refocused their efforts to seize Kyiv, firing artillery on suburbs, a local official said on Ukrainian television.

Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan, reporting from Kyiv, said residents in the capital were in for another nervous night, after the shelling of an apartment block in the early morning hours killed at least one person.

“A lot of the residents are very worried that that [attack] may have been an opening salvo for the war for control of the capital,” Khan said. “Military analysts are suggesting it may have been a way to keep pressure on the Ukrainians even as the talks were going on.”

Erdogan says unclear whether Turkey will buy more Russian arms

Turkey’s President Tayyip Erdogan has said it is too early to comment on Turkey’s possible purchase of more Russian weapons given Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

NATO member Turkey was handed US sanctions in December 2020 over its purchase of Russian S-400 missile defence systems and had been criticised by Western allies over the move. Ankara has said it was forced to opt for the Russian weapons because allies did not provide arms on satisfactory terms.

The Ukrainian troops are shooting in all directions, saying Russian snipers are stationed on rooftops to prevent the civilians from leaving the city. Dozens of residents were seen leaving from this area as well as the eastern side of Irpin.

The Ukrainians said they managed to fend off the Russians this morning. You can see the Ukrainian army’s forefront, they are trying to force the Russians back.

To my right, also fierce exchange of gunfire. It seems the Russians are advancing from more than one direction (natural sound… firing)… heavy machine guns and anti-craft guns are fired… (natural)…. (sky) they are firing into the air. It seems like a drone is hovering above… (natural)…. In this spot, and a few minutes before we arrived, dozens of civilian residents had left the city.

They claim the Russian forces granted them only a 15-minute window to leave the area before roads are closed. Many of the residents who were stranded in the eastern suburbs of Irpin managed to leave.

The Ukrainian troops are adamant to fight to force the Russians back since thousands of civilians are still trapped in northern and eastern parts of the city.”

Ukraine war must end, Russia’s fertiliser and coal king says

The war in Ukraine is a tragedy that must be stopped or there will be a global food crisis as fertilizer prices are already too high for many farmers, Russia’s coal and fertiliser king Andrei Melnichenko said.

“The events in Ukraine are truly tragic. We urgently need peace,” Melnichenko, 50, who is Russian but was born in Belarus and has a Ukrainian mother, told Reuters in a statement emailed by his spokesman.

“As a Russian by nationality, a Belarusian by birth, and a Ukrainian by blood, I feel great pain and disbelief witnessing brotherly peoples fighting and dying.”

Russia threatens Western companies with arrests, seizures: Report

Russian authorities, facing potential economic calamity as Western sanctions take hold, have threatened foreign companies hoping to withdraw from the country with arrests and asset seizures, the Wall Street Journal has reported.

Russian prosecutors have issued warnings to several foreign entities – via calls, letters and in-person visits – including to Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Procter & Gamble, IBM and Yum! Brands, the parent company of KFC and Pizza Hut, according to the business daily, citing sources familiar with the matter.

They have threatened to arrest officials who have criticised the government or to seize assets, including intellectual property.

“The warnings have prompted at least one of the targeted companies to limit communications between its Russian business and the rest of the company, out of concern that emails or text messages among colleagues may be intercepted, some of the people (familiar with the matter) said,” according to the Wall Street Journal.

US, China aides to meet amid tensions over Russia

The US and China are sending top aides to meet in Rome on Monday amid mounting tensions between the two countries over the Russia-Ukraine war, with the US saying Russia has asked China for military equipment to help press its campaign.

In advance of the talks, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan bluntly warned China to avoid helping Russia evade punishment from global sanctions that have hammered the Russian economy. “We will not allow that to go forward,” he said.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has put China in a delicate spot with two of its biggest trading partners: the US and the European Union. China needs access to those markets, yet it also has shown support for Moscow, joining with Russia in declaring a friendship with “no limits”.

Bermuda’s aviation regulator has said it is suspending certification of all Russian-operated aircraft registered in the British overseas territory due to international sanctions over the war in Ukraine, in a move expected to affect more than 700 planes.

The regulator said it was unable to confidently approve the planes as airworthy due to the effect of sanctions on its ability to conduct safety oversight.

Russian default no longer ‘improbable’

Russia may default on its debts in the wake of unprecedented sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine, but that would not trigger a global financial crisis, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has said.

Georgieva told CBS’s “Face the Nation” programme that sanctions imposed by the United States and other democracies were already having a “severe” effect on the Russian economy and would trigger a deep recession there this year.

The sanctions were limiting Russia’s ability to access its resources and service its debts, which meant a default was no longer viewed as “improbable,” the IMF official said.

Asked if such a default could trigger a financial crisis around the world, she said, “For now, no.”

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

In a video address posted on social media late Saturday night, President Volodymyr Zelensky said nevertheless the Russians did not have the strength or spirit to conquer Ukraine. ""The Russian invaders cannot conquer us. They do not have such strength. They do not have such spirit. They are holding only on violence. Only on terror. Only on weapons, which they have a lot,"" he said. A convoy of humanitarian aid headed for Mariupol had been blocked at a Russian checkpoint, but it was hoped it could reach the city Sunday, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. The strategic port, in particular, is facing what Ukraine says is a ""humanitarian catastrophe,"" with more than 1,500 civilians killed. Attempts to evacuate hundreds of thousands of civilians have repeatedly failed. ""Mariupol is still surrounded, that which they cannot have by war, [the Russians] want to have by hunger and despair. Since they cannot bring down the Ukrainian army, they target the population,"" a French military source said. A top Russian officer described the situation in stark language. ""Unfortunately, the humanitarian situation in Ukraine is continuing to deteriorate rapidly, and in some cities, it has reached catastrophic proportions,"" said the head of the Russian National Defense Control Center, Mikhail Mizintsev. In his video address, Zelensky appealed for more aid. ""I keep reiterating to our allies and friends abroad; they have to keep doing more for our country, for Ukrainians and Ukraine. Because it is not only for Ukraine, but it is for all of Europe,"" he said.

City under siege The Russians have advanced far enough to raise fears of Kyiv becoming encircled imminently. Other cities have already fallen or been surrounded since Russia invaded its neighbor on Feb. 24, with civilians targeted in what the United Nations warned could amount to war crimes. The key southern port of Odessa was preparing for an offensive by Russian troops, who were concentrating about 100 kilometers (60 miles) to the east in the city of Mykolaiv. Mykolaiv, which lies on the road to the strategic port city, has been under attack for days, and an AFP reporter said a hospital there came under fire. Zelensky said ""about 1,300"" Ukrainian soldiers had been killed since Feb. 24, giving his country's first official toll. He claimed Russia had lost about 12,000 troops while Moscow, for its part, has only given a toll of 498 dead, released on March 2. At least 579 civilians have been killed, according to a tally Saturday by the United Nations, which stressed that its figures were probably much lower than reality. The United Nations estimates that almost 2.6 million people have fled Ukraine since the invasion, most of them to Poland, in Europe's worst refugee crisis since World War II. In Kyiv, only the roads to the south remain open and the city is preparing to mount a ""relentless defense,"" according to the Ukrainian presidency. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said the capital, described by a senior Ukrainian official Friday as a ""city under siege,"" was reinforcing defenses and stockpiling food and medicine. Britain's ministry of defense estimated that Russian forces were about 25 kilometers from the capital on Saturday and that a column north of the city had dispersed, reinforcing the indication of an attempt to encircle it. However, the Russians are encountering resistance from the Ukrainian army to both the east and west of the capital, according to AFP journalists on the spot. Ukrainian soldiers said they believe the Russians have overestimated their resources, in terms of troops and equipment, and underestimated those of their opponent. ""They have to camp in villages in temperatures of nearly minus 10 Celsius at night. They lack provisions and have to raid houses,"" said one soldier, Ilya Berezenko, 27.

Glimmer of hope Intense efforts at diplomacy continued, with the leaders of France and Germany, Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz, urging Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin during a three-way phone conversation on Saturday to end the deadly blockade, Paris said. Facing growing international condemnation, Putin sought to turn the tables, slamming Kyiv for what he described as the ""flagrant violation"" of international humanitarian law and accusing Ukraine's army of executing dissenters and using civilians as hostages. The French presidency denounced his accusations, made during the talks with Macron and Scholz, as ""lies."" But in a small glimmer of hope, Zelensky said Saturday that Russia — after appearing unbudging for days — had adopted a ""fundamentally different approach"" in the latest talks to end the conflict. He told reporters he was ""happy to have a signal from Russia"" after Putin spoke of ""some positive shifts"" in a near-daily dialogue. As Russia widens its bombardment, Zelensky's pleas for help have grown increasingly desperate. Washington and its EU allies have sent funds and military aid to Ukraine and taken action against Russia's economy and oligarchs. A cultural and sporting boycott has further isolated Moscow. In the Kyiv suburb of Irpin on Saturday, a Ukrainian soldier who gave his name only as Viktor showed off his British anti-tank missile system and the twisted remains of a Russian vehicle it destroyed. ""I want to say a big thank you to our British comrades helping us,"" he said. As international sanctions against Moscow have steadily tightened, crippling Russia's economy, the country's space agency Roscosmos warned Saturday that the International Space Station could crash if Russian spacecraft serving it are affected. But Washington on Friday added still more layers of sanctions, this time ending normal trade relations and announcing a ban on Russian vodka, seafood and diamonds. And on Saturday, U.S. President Joe Biden authorised up to $200 million in new weapons and other aid to Ukraine. But he has ruled out direct action against nuclear-armed Russia, warning that it would lead to ""World War III.""",https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/03/13/alarm-grows-over-mariupol-as-russia-squeezes-kyiv-a76893

this is the pathway that is bringing thousands of Ukrainian refugees to safety and also to a life of uncertainty. Many of these people have been traveling from the interior of the country. We spoke with one family that had come from Caribbean rig, which is as fate would have it. The hometown of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelinski Hometown obviously has become such a beloved figure among the Ukrainian people. They told us they had been traveling since 7:00 AM on Sunday and it was just after midnight when they finally arrived to this border checkpoint in the cold here in Poland. And the uncertainty now comes from the fact that as these families begin to board these busses, what happens to them next is still very much up in the air. They will be taken to temporary shelter in a nearby town here on the polish border. And they will be able to figure out what to do next where to go next. And that is the question That so many of them are now facing. Because many of them when you speak to these refugees, they talk about their homes in the past tense. So they don't know if they're going home in the coming weeks or even months or if ever. And this is an operation here in this in the border city of Medica Poland, that is running 24 hours a day as thousands of refugees continue to come across the border. And this is a scene that even here in the late hours continues to unfold as thousands of refugees continue to arrive at the border here in western Ukraine. A great deal of uncertainty about what happens next. A great deal of emotion, watching what so many of these people and the journey they've been through. And this is a scene that just continues to play out around the clock here in Poland. Ed Lavandera. CNN medical Poland. Yeah.

Almost three weeks after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, its forces are expanding their offensive to the west of the country. Here are five important developments from this weekend.Russian missiles kill dozens at military training center near Polish borderAt least 35 people were killed and 134 injured in a Russian missile strike on the Yavoriv military training base in western Ukraine early Sunday local time, Ukrainian authorities said.The base is located about 25 miles northwest of Lviv and less than 12.5 miles from the Polish border. It's home to the International Peacekeeping and Security Center, which hosts training exercises with Western military personnel.On Sunday, Russia said up to 180 foreign mercenaries were killed by the strikes, but Ukrainian Defense Ministry spokesperson Markiyan Lubkivsky told CNN the claims were ""pure Russian propaganda.""Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said there had been ""some damage"" to the facility, but the Pentagon was ""still assessing and talking to the Ukrainians"" about the extent of it.No American service members were at the training facility because they had all left weeks earlier, Kirby told ABC on Sunday.The strikes show increased Russian focus on the west of the country, he added. ""This is the third... facility or airfield that the Russians have struck in western Ukraine in just the last couple of days, so clearly, at least from an airstrike perspective, they're broadening their target sets,"" Kirby said.Explosions in Kyiv as Russian forces inch closerAt least two people died and three more were hospitalized after a residential building in Obolon, a suburb of the capital, Kyiv, was hit by shelling early on Monday morning, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said.Several heavy explosions also reverberated across Kyiv at 11 a.m. local time (5 a.m. ET) Monday.They appear to have been caused by Ukrainian air-defense batteries aiming at either Russian aircraft or cruise missiles. Trails of smoke heading into the sky could be seen from central Kyiv.On Saturday, the UK Ministry of Defence said the bulk of Russian ground forces were now only 15.5 miles from the center of the Ukrainian capital.Thousands dead in Mariupol as conditions grow even worseMore than 2,500 people have been killed by the Russian bombardment of the southern city of Mariupol, according to Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser in President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office, and the humanitarian situation continues to worsen.""The Russians are just wiping the city out,"" Arestovych said on Monday.A shipment of humanitarian supplies has been unable to reach the city due to heavy shelling, Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said on Sunday.""The city of Mariupol was subjected to shelling and aerial bombardment all day long,"" Vereshchuk said. ""The humanitarian cargo remained blocked in the city of Berdyansk halfway to the occupied city.""On Sunday morning, a Mariupol resident recorded a video diary revealing the desperate situation for civilians. The footage, posted on Twitter, shows looted shops and people trying to cook outdoors in sub-zero temperatures.""There's no humanitarian aid and will not be. The evacuation of peaceful people is impossible,"" the resident said.""People are in a devastating situation. Water, food are coming to an end, people are forced to break into shops, in search for necessities.""Mass protests in occupied Kherson and accusations of treason in MelitopolThe strategic city of Kherson in southern Ukraine has been occupied by Russian forces since March 3, but on Sunday hundreds of people took to the streets to protest the occupation.In recent days, at least one Kherson regional council official warned that occupation forces were laying the groundwork for a ""Kherson People's Republic.""City mayor Ihor Kolykhaiev said the demonstration was ""a peaceful protest to show that the citizens' position is that Kherson is Ukraine.""Russian forces have been accused of abducting local Ukrainian officials in two other cities.On Friday, the mayor of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, was seen on video being led away from a government building in the city by armed men.A short time later, the Russian-backed Luhansk regional prosecutor claimed that Fedorov had committed terrorism offenses and was under investigation.Galina Danilchenko was installed as the new mayor of the city, but Ukraine's prosecutor general has opened an investigation after a group of Melitopol City Council members issued a written statement on Sunday accusing her of ""the high crime of treason, for attempting to set up an occupying government in Melitopol.""Separately, Yevhen Matveyev, the mayor of Dniprorudne in Zaporizhzhia region, was abducted by Russian troops on Sunday, according to Ukraine's Foreign Minister, Dmytro Kuleba.US-China talks scheduled after Moscow reportedly asks Beijing for military support in UkraineRussia has asked China for military support, including drones, as well as economic assistance for its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, according to conversations CNN had with two U.S. officials.Potential assistance from the Chinese would be a significant development. It could upend the hold Ukrainian forces still have in the country, and provide a counterweight to the hefty Western sanctions imposed on Russia's economy.When asked by CNN about the reporting of Russia's request for military aid, Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in the U.S., said in a statement: ""I've never heard of that."" The Russian embassy in the U.S. did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.U.S. and Chinese officials will meet in Rome on Monday for talks that experts say could have far-reaching consequences not only for the war in Ukraine, but for China's role in the world and its relationship with the West.The meeting, between China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, and U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan, comes as concerns grow in the West that Beijing is not only siding with Russia by not condemning its aggression in Ukraine, but could take further steps to aid its strategic partner.",https://www.koco.com/article/what-happened-in-ukraine-over-the-weekend-march-14/39427687

LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) -A convoy of at least 160 cars left Mariupol on Monday in the first successful attempt to arrange a humanitarian corridor out of the encircled Ukrainian city after over a week of trying.

Civilians have been trapped in the southern port city by Russian shelling for more than two weeks and have been without heating, electricity and running water for most of this time, the Ukrainian authorities say.

More than 2,500 residents have been killed there since the Russian invasion on Feb. 24, a Ukrainian official said.

A local ceasefire arranged with the Russian forces besieging Mariupol held long enough for the first cars to leave for the city of Zaporizhzhia about 225 km (140 miles) away, senior Ukrainian and local officials said.

Efforts were also being made to deliver supplies to the remaining civilians after the city council said on Sunday the last reserves of food and water were running out. Russia says it does not target civilians.

""At one o'clock (1100 GMT) the Russians opened a checkpoint and those who have cars and fuel began to leave Mariupol in the direction of Zaporizhzhia,"" Andrei Rempel, a representative of the city council who is now in Zaporizhzhia, told Reuters.

""In the first two hours, 160 cars left. There are probably already many more now. The city continues to be bombed but this road is not being shelled. We don't know when the first cars can get to Zaporizhzhia as there are still many Russian checkpoints that need to be passed.""

The city council said the convoy had already passed Berdyansk, a city about 85 km from Mariupol.

Reuters was unable to verify the convoy's progress from Mariupol, a city of about 400,000 in peacetime that local officials say has been devastated by Russian shelling.

'CRITICAL' SITUATION

The city council described the situation in Mariupol on Friday as ""critical"".

Presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said on Monday that more than 2,500 residents had been killed since Feb. 24. The toll could not be independently verified by Reuters.

Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk confirmed the convoy of private cars had left Mariupol but said Russian shelling was preventing a convoy reaching the city with humanitarian supplies.

""We will now do everything we can to get our convoy to Mariupol and pick up women and children on the way back,"" she said.

Each side has blamed the other for the failure of other attempts to open humanitarian corridors. Moscow describes its actions in Ukraine as a special operation to disarm its neighbour and unseat leaders it calls neo-Nazis.

A senior official in President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's office said more than 1,700 people had also been evacuated on Monday through humanitarian corridors in the eastern region of Luhansk, although Ukrainian officials said there was Russian fire along the entire frontline.

""We're here to help people. Hopefully, it's going to be over before we reach the fronts, before we need to fire a bullet or save someone with medical resources. That's the best for everyone. But if that's what it comes to, we'll be there,"" he said.

All volunteers get some training. While many can contribute on the battlefield, others may never see combat.

David, a 33-year-old Canadian, said he can help fix tires to keep Ukrainian military vehicles on the road.

""If it's black and round and made out of rubber, I can fix it. One of the most important things of the gears of war is keeping it moving,"" he told CNN.

However, arming thousands of people is not without its risks.

""They might be dangerous,"" said Roman, a man who vets the background of all foreign volunteers. ""We try to check their biography, try to check their past as best we can.""

And Ukraine does not just need on-field fighters. Volunteers with combat medical experience are urgently required too.

That's what brought Sky Barkley, a US Marine and missionary to Ukraine, along with six other Americans. Barkley said this war does not compare to an insurgency or even the fight against ISIS.

""I mean, we're talking about the sheer amount of missiles being launched across the country, the ability of the Russians to reach out across hundreds and hundreds of kilometers and kill from that kind of distance,"" he told CNN.

Part of Barkley's team is Missouri native Maddie Hayes, who served as a nurse in Iraq.

""I just have a heart for these people. I just really want to help them. I don't see my life more valuable than their life,"" she said.

Sciutto reports that the training the Ukrainian military is able to offer foreign volunteers is limited — volunteers will get three to 14 days of basic training, and it's not a short-term commitment. Those who volunteer to fight are asked to sign on for a year of commitment in Ukraine.

Ukrainian officials have made clear this is ""not a calling for adventurers or weekend warriors,"" but a ""service against a massive and ruthless invading army,"" Sciutto reports.

Just last week, the State Department warned Americans who travel to Ukraine and fight with Ukrainian forces in the ongoing war will be treated by Russians as “mercenaries” or foreign fighters, Russians have said, which puts them at a greater risk of mistreatment.

US citizens could also face criminal prosecution, capture or death from Russia for fighting on behalf of Ukraine in the war, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a briefing Friday, adding that the US will also not be able to evacuate American citizens from Ukraine at any point.

He did it, he said, to avoid World War III. But in doing so, he inadvertently raised the risk of such a war.

American timidity on air support reduces the likelihood of Russia’s retreat from Ukraine. Even without direct support from the U.S., the Ukrainian military has valiantly slowed the Russian invasion. But in response, Russia started indiscriminately bombarding cities, block by block, killing and wounding, degrading infrastructure, choking off vital supplies.

Chernihiv (population 285,000), Kharkiv (1.5 million), Sumy (265,000) and Mariupol (446,000) are reduced to a familiar landscape of death and ruin, like Guernica, like Stalingrad, like Grozny, like Aleppo. The capital, Kyiv, is now on the line. The pleas of pregnant women escaping from a bombed-out maternity hospital, the sight of dead bodies piling up in city streets and other horrors of war give Russian President Vladimir Putin confidence that the hurt will eventually bring Ukraine to its knees. A retreat is less likely with every mile that Russia gains.

If Putin succeeds, he won’t stop in Ukraine. The specter of popular uprisings and insurgency would haunt him. He would fear the neighboring states, all NATO members, lending support to his foes. He would fear a spillover into Russia. He’d fear being treated as a war criminal if he loses.

Controlling Ukraine would also give Russia more resources to press onward. For one, most Soviet ICBMs were made in Ukraine.

Putin already has good reason to believe he can intimidate NATO into acquiescence as he invades other nations. After threatening to strike NATO states that help Ukraine, he must have rejoiced when policymakers pledged not to provoke Russia.

Putin will have a perfect opportunity to test whether Biden will indeed “defend every inch” of NATO territory, or will continue to appease. On the map of Europe, you can see a forlorn piece of land on the Baltic Sea, boxed in by two NATO states, Lithuania and Poland. This is Russia’s province of Kaliningrad, home to the Kremlin’s Baltic fleet. NATO could blockade Kaliningrad, isolating that outpost of Russia. To reduce this perceived vulnerability, Putin might invade Poland and Lithuania to seize a land corridor to Kaliningrad from Belarus, a Russian ally. The corridor would be the Suwalki Gap, a 60-mile-long sliver of flatland.

Putin will have a strong hand to test NATO’s resolve there. If he perseveres with his December ultimatum that NATO should move out of Eastern Europe, masses troops and threatens nuclear retaliation if NATO tries to stop him, how would we respond? The only gambit that might get his attention would be to threaten a nuclear response. But would the American public support such brinkmanship, knowing it could lead to nuclear war? Would we really want to risk sacrificing major American cities just to protect the Suwalki Gap?

Precisely because Putin knows we would face this dilemma — and given our record in Ukraine and Afghanistan — our pledge to defend allies would not deter him from invading. The U.S. will then face its choice: defend allies against the advancing Russian tanks and face the prospect of Russia’s nuclear blow, or abandon our allies. We may have to decide within hours, even minutes, how to respond.

The MiG-29s from Poland would help us avert this scenario. They would undercut Putin’s power to hit targets in Ukraine like hospitals and residential areas. They’d give Ukraine more options to hit Russian bombers and missile complexes that can’t be reached by the missiles the U.S. has provided. Ukrainian pilots in Polish MiGs could buy time for economic sanctions to hurt Putin at home, and perhaps time for him to question Russia’s standing with China and India. Crucially, Putin would see he cannot scare the West into inaction, which might persuade him not to further test our resolve.

But Biden is not signaling that resolve.

I feel less safe here in the U.S. now than before Biden vetoed the MiG-29 transfer. Putin may test NATO sooner rather than later, while Biden is president.

Russian aggression against Ukraine shows that we are entering a moment in world history when caution is riskier than audacity, a moment when we need a president who can lead like Winston Churchill and Volodymyr Zelensky, not like Neville Chamberlain.

Security camera footage verified by The New York Times showed a building ablaze inside the Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex near a line of military vehicles. The videos appeared to show people in the vehicles firing at buildings in the power plant. Ukraine’s state emergency service later said the blaze went out after 6 a.m.

The fire did not affect essential equipment at the plant, the International Atomic Energy Agency said on Twitter, citing its communication with the Ukrainian government.

About an hour after dawn, Ukraine’s nuclear regulatory inspectorate said in a statement that Russian military forces were now occupying the complex. It said that all of the site’s power units remained intact and that no changes in radiation levels had been observed.

The fire broke out after a Russian attack on a training building outside the perimeter of the plant, according to a statement by Ukraine’s state emergency service. A spokesman for the nuclear plant, Andriy Tuz, was quoted by The Associated Press as telling Ukrainian television that shells had set fire to one of the plant’s six reactors that was under renovation and not operating.

Ukraine’s nuclear inspectorate later said in its statement that one unit of the six units was operating, another was in “outage,” two were being cooled down, and two others had been disconnected from the grid.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine had accused the Russian military of deliberately attacking the complex and said an explosion there would have been “the end for everybody, the end of Europe.”

“Only immediate actions by Europe could stop the Russian army,” he added.

President Biden spoke with Mr. Zelensky about the fire and joined him in urging Russia to “cease its military activities in the area and allow firefighters and emergency responders to access the site,” the White House said. Local reports later said that emergency crews had gained access.

Mr. Biden’s energy secretary, Jennifer M. Granholm, said on Twitter that the United States had not detected elevated radiation readings in the area, echoing an earlier assessment by the International Atomic Energy Agency. “The plant’s reactors are protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down,” she said.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain said he would seek an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council about the blaze at the complex, according to his office.

Before the fire was reported by Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, the director general for the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement that “a large number of Russian tanks and infantry” had entered Enerhodar, a town next to the plant. The director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said that troops were “moving directly” toward the reactor site.

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex, on the Dnieper River roughly a hundred miles north of Crimea, is the largest in Europe. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, its six reactors produce a total of 6,000 megawatts of electric power.

In comparison, the Chernobyl plant in northern Ukraine produced 3,800 megawatts — about a third less. (A megawatt, one million watts, is enough power to light 10,000 hundred-watt bulbs.) The four reactors of the Chernobyl complex were shut down after one suffered a catastrophic fire and meltdown in 1986.

The reactors’ cores are full of highly radioactive fuel. But an additional danger at the Zaporizhzhia site is the many acres of open pools of water behind the complex where spent fuel rods have been cooled for years. Experts fear that errant shells or missiles that hit such sites could set off radiological disasters.

For days, social media reports have detailed how the residents of Enerhodar set up a giant barrier of tires, vehicles and metal barricades to try to block a Russian advance into the city and the reactor site. Christoph Koettl, a visual investigator for The New York Times, noted on Twitter that the barricades were so large that they could be seen from outer space by orbiting satellites.

Starting this past Sunday, three days into the invasion, Ukraine’s nuclear regulator began reporting an unusual rate of disconnection: Six of the nation’s 15 reactors were offline. On Tuesday, the Zaporizhzhia facility was the site with the most reactors offline.

Summary Companies Russian air strike hits military base near Polish border

Moscow says destroyed weapons, killed 'foreign mercenaries'

Ukraine, Russia both hint at progress in talks on war

U.S. journalist killed near Kyiv

LVIV, Ukraine, March 13 (Reuters) - A barrage of Russian missiles hit a large Ukrainian base near the border with NATO member Poland on Sunday, killing 35 people and wounding 134, a local official said, in an escalation of the war to the west of the country as fighting raged elsewhere.

Russia's defence ministry said the air strike had destroyed a large amount of weapons supplied by foreign nations that were being stored at the sprawling training facility, and that it had killed ""up to 180 foreign mercenaries"".

Reuters could not independently verify the casualties reported by either side.

The attack on the Yavoriv International Centre for Peacekeeping and Security, a base just 15 miles (25 km) from the Polish border that has previously hosted NATO military instructors, brought the conflict to the doorstep of the Western defence alliance.

Russia had warned on Saturday that convoys of Western arms shipments to Ukraine could be considered legitimate targets.

Britain called the attack as a ""significant escalation,"" and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken responded with a post on Twitter saying ""the brutality must stop."" read more

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan, speaking on CBS's ""Face the Nation"", warned any attack on NATO territory would trigger a full response by the alliance.

Regional governor Maksym Kozytskyy said Russian planes fired around 30 rockets at the Yavoriv facility.

Russian defence ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov said Russia had used high-precision, long-range weapons to strike Yavoriv and a separate facility in the village of Starichi.

""As a result of the strike, up to 180 foreign mercenaries and a large amount of foreign weapons were destroyed,"" he said.

The 360-square km (140-square mile) facility is one of Ukraine's biggest and is the largest in the western part of the country, which has so far been spared the worst of the fighting.

Ukraine, whose aspirations to join NATO are a major irritant to Russian President Vladimir Putin, held most of its drills with Western countries at the base before the invasion. The last major exercises were in September.

In the weeks before Russia's Feb. 24 invasion, the Ukrainian military trained there, but according to Ukrainian media all foreign instructors left in mid-February, leaving behind equipment.

""The dining room and dormitory were destroyed. So were the barracks,"" said Colonel Leonid Benzalo, an officer in the Ukrainian medical reserve who was thrown across the room by one of the blasts. ""The most important thing is we're still alive,"" he told Reuters after treating the wounded there. read more

While Western nations have sought to isolate Putin by imposing harsh economic sanctions and have been supplying Ukraine with weapons, the United States and its allies are concerned to avoid NATO being drawn into the conflict.

""There are no NATO personnel in Ukraine,"" the NATO official said, when asked if anyone from the alliance was at the base.

STOCKPILING FOOD

Heavy fighting was reported on multiple fronts.

Air raid sirens wailed across the capital Kyiv and authorities said they were stockpiling two weeks worth of food for the 2 million people who have not yet fled from Russian forces attempting to encircle the city.

Ukraine reported renewed air strikes on an airport in the west and heavy shelling on Chernihiv, northeast of the capital.

Interior Ministry official Vadym Denyenko said Ukrainian forces were counterattacking in the eastern Kharkiv region and around the southern town of Mykolayiv. Reuters was not able to verify those statements.

An American journalist was shot and killed by Russian forces in the town of Irpin, northwest of Kyiv, and another journalist was wounded, the regional police chief said. read more

Britain's defence ministry said Russian naval forces had established a distant blockade of Ukraine's Black Sea coast, isolating the country from international maritime trade.

""We must hold on. We must fight. And we will win,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a nighttime video address.

Despite the violence, both sides gave their most upbeat assessment yet of prospects for progress at talks held periodically.

""Russia is already beginning to talk constructively,"" Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak said in a video online. ""I think that we will achieve some results literally in a matter of days.""

A Russian delegate to talks, Leonid Slutsky, was quoted by RIA news agency as saying they had made significant progress and it was possible the delegations could soon reach draft agreements. read more

Neither side said what these would cover. Three rounds of talks between the two sides in Belarus, most recently last Monday, had focused mainly on humanitarian issues.

Zelenskiy said the countries' delegations have been speaking daily by video link and a clear aim of his negotiators was to ""do everything"" to arrange for him to meet with Putin.

'VIOLENT AND INHUMAN'

In the weeks since the invasion began, Russia has asked China - which has not condemned the assault on Ukraine - for military equipment, the Financial Times and Washington Post cited unnamed U.S. officials as saying. read more

A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington said he had not heard of such a request and that the priority was to prevent the situation ""from escalating or even getting out of control."" read more

Russia's invasion has sent more than 2.5 million people fleeing across Ukraine's borders and trapped hundreds of thousands in besieged cities. read more

""It is terrifying how violent and inhuman it is,"" Olga, a refugee from Kyiv, told Reuters after crossing into Romania.

Ukraine's human rights monitor said Russia used phosphorous bombs in an overnight attack on the town of Popasna in the eastern Luhansk region, calling it a ""war crime"". She shared a photograph purporting to show the alleged attack. Reuters could not immediately verify any of the reports.

Phosphorus munitions can be used legally in war to provide light, create smokescreens or burn buildings. But its use in populated areas has been a persistent source of controversy.

In eastern Ukraine, Russian troops were trying to surround Ukrainian forces as they advance from the port of Mariupol in the south and the second city Kharkiv in the north, the British Defence Ministry said.

The city council in Mariupol said 2,187 residents had been killed since the start of the invasion. Reuters was not able to verify that toll.

Kharkiv has suffered some of the heaviest bombardment. Videos from one resident, Teimur Aliev, showed bombed buildings lining streets, burned-out cars riddled with shrapnel holes and debris strewn around.

""We will stitch up the wounds and the pain of our country and our city,"" said Aliev, a 23-year-old musician. ""We're not going anywhere."" read more

In Chernihiv, northeast of Kyiv, firefighters rescued residents from a burning building after heavy shelling, video from emergency service - and verified by Reuters - showed.

Moscow denies targeting civilians. It blames Ukraine for failed attempts to evacuate civilians from encircled cities, an accusation Ukraine and its Western allies strongly reject.

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said more than 140,000 people had been evacuated from conflict zones, but a humanitarian convoy had been unable to reach Mariupol due to shelling.

The Kremlin describes its actions as a ""special operation"" to demilitarise and ""deNazify"" Ukraine. Ukraine and Western allies call this a baseless pretext for a war of choice.

CNN has reached out to the Russian embassy in the US for comment but did not receive an immediate response.

White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN's Dana Bash Sunday that China providing Russia with support is a “concern.”

“We also are watching closely to see the extent to which China actually does provide any form of support, material support or economic support, to Russia. It is a concern of ours. And we have communicated to Beijing that we will not stand by and allow any country to compensate Russia for its losses from the economic sanctions,” Sullivan said.

Sullivan said the US has made it clear to Beijing there will ""absolutely be consequences"" for ""large-scale"" efforts to give the Kremlin a workaround to US sanctions.

""We will not allow that to go forward and allow there to be a lifeline to Russia from these economic sanctions from any country anywhere in the world,"" he said.

Sullivan is set to meet with his Chinese counterpart Yang Jiechi in Rome Monday.

Chinese embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu told CNN Sunday he had not heard of Russia's request.

""I've never heard of that. China is deeply concerned and grieved on the Ukraine situation. We sincerely hope that the situation will ease and peace will return at an early date,"" Pengyu said. ""The current situation in Ukraine is indeed disconcerting. Utmost efforts should be made to support Russia and Ukraine in carrying forward negotiations despite the difficult situation to produce a peaceful outcome. We support and encourage all efforts that are conducive to a peaceful settlement of the crisis. The high priority now is to prevent the tense situation from escalating or even getting out of control. There is consensus about this among the international community, including the parties concerned.”

“China calls for exercising utmost restraint and preventing a massive humanitarian crisis. China has put forward an initiative for responding to the humanitarian situation in Ukraine. China has provided Ukraine with humanitarian assistance, and will continue to do so,” Pengyu said.

The White House said last week China was “abiding by the requirements that have been put in place” over sanctions.

MUKACHEVKO, Ukraine — At least 35 people were killed and 134 injured on Sunday when a barrage of Russian missiles slammed into a military facility in western Ukraine about 15 miles from the border with Poland, Ukrainian officials said. It was the closest attack thus far to NATO’s border and an ominous expansion of Russia’s targeting.

The Russian Ministry of Defense charged that the facility was a “training center for foreign mercenaries” and a storage base for weapons and equipment being sent to Ukraine by “foreign countries.” A day earlier, the Kremlin warned that it viewed Western weapons shipments “legitimate targets.”

In another sign of the expanding conflict, the White House said national security adviser Jake Sullivan would meet in Rome on Monday with a top Chinese official to warn of what Sullivan said would “absolutely be consequences” for any Chinese efforts to assist Russia in evading sanctions.

Since the invasion began, Russia has turned to China, the only major world power that hasn’t turned its back on Moscow, for military equipment and aid, according to U.S. officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter. The officials did not comment on whether, or how, China had responded to the Russian request. A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, Liu Pengyu, said in an email he was not aware of any such request for assistance.

Conditions for residents of cities facing constant attacks from Russian forces have steadily eroded. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that nearly 125,000 people have been evacuated from the conflict zones via humanitarian corridors through which the Russians have sporadically allowed them to exit.

But efforts to evacuate citizens and deliver crucial supplies to Mariupol, the city on the southeastern coast where Russian forces have cut off sources of water and electricity, continue to be thwarted by Russian bombardment. In a video address, Zelensky said humanitarian aid was about 50 miles away from the city, but a convoy had been unable to move farther. The Mariupol city council has put the death toll there at 2,187.

On March 13, Russian missiles struck Ukrainian military facilities near the Polish border, killing at least 35 and injuring at least 134. (Video: Twitter)

As Russian forces continued positioning themselves to encircle Kyiv, an American journalist was killed by gunfire in Irpin, a town on the outskirts of the capital. Ukrainian officials also accused the Russians of abducting a second mayor, in the southeastern town of Dniprorudne, after last week’s apparent arrest of the mayor of the port city of Melitopol.

The barrage of attacks on Sunday in the city of Yavoriv hit a facility known as the International Peacekeeping and Security Center, where NATO troops in the recent past have trained Ukrainian forces. NATO officials said that no alliance forces were present at the time of the attack.

Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said U.S. troops on a training mission had left the facility “several weeks ago,” and there were “no Americans at all working” there. “This is the third now military facility or airfield that the Russians have struck in western Ukraine in just the last couple of days,” Kirby said Sunday. “So clearly, at least from an airstrike perspective, they’re broadening their target sets.”

The Russian Defense Ministry’s account of the strike, differing with that provided by Ukrainian officials, said that “up to 180 foreign mercenaries” were killed, along with the destruction of a “large consignment of foreign weapons.” It said that such strikes would continue.

It was not immediately clear if the Russian claims about foreigners being at the facility were true. Western volunteers, including military veterans, have begun to arrive to fight alongside Ukrainian forces, and Russian officials have referred to them as mercenaries.

Western Ukraine has so far seen less fighting than eastern cities closer to the frontier with Russia, which have been pummeled by airstrikes, missiles and artillery, and choked off by sieges since Russian tanks rolled across the border more than two weeks ago. Waves of people seeking refuge from violence farther east have poured into the far western city of Lviv, which has become a hub for the internally displaced.

Sullivan said the bombing of the base did not come as a surprise to the American intelligence and national security officials. He noted that the United States had been warning “well before the invasion got underway” that Putin planned to attack all of Ukraine, “southern Ukraine, eastern Ukraine, and yes, western Ukraine.”

“What it shows is that Vladimir Putin is frustrated by the fact that his forces are not making the kind of progress that he thought that they would make against major cities, including Kyiv,” Sullivan said. “That he is expanding the number of targets, that he is lashing out and that he is trying to cause damage in every part of the country.”

He reiterated President Biden’s insistence that U.S. military forces would not be fighting Russian troops in Ukraine but that they would “defend every inch of NATO territory.”

The Lviv regional governor accused Russia of firing 30 missiles at the facility from the direction of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, warning that “the shelling is approaching the borders of NATO countries.” The Ukrainian air defense system shot down many of them and authorities had put out fires at the site, he added.

“Do you understand that war is closer than you imagine?” the Lviv mayor said in a Telegram message, addressing the United States and the European Union.

U.S. officials said they could not verify whether the attack was launched from aircraft or by sea. Hours after the strike, U.S. senators visiting refugees just over the Polish border echoed the Ukrainian government’s call for providing aircraft to Kyiv, which the Biden administration has said could lead to possible direct conflict between NATO and Russia. “I don’t understand why we’re not doing it,” said Sen. Robert Portman (R-Ohio), speaking from the refugee site.

Also a part of the delegation, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said, “I’d like to see the planes over there.” While she said the administration was determining the best form of air defense, “I still don’t rule out having planes at some point.”

Last week, the administration rejected a Polish plan to fly Soviet-era fighter jets in its arsenal to a U.S. air base in Germany for transfer to Ukraine. The United States and many of its NATO allies have said that they will increase shipments of antitank and antiaircraft weaponry.

Sullivan noted that allies, which have sent portable Stinger and other antiaircraft missile systems to Ukraine, are also reportedly considering the transfer of Russian-made S-300 systems, which Romania and other former Warsaw Pact, now NATO, countries have in their arsenals. Those systems can intercept aircraft at far higher altitudes.

It was unclear whether the Yavoriv facility was a main collection point for Western armaments and supplies flowing into Ukraine from Poland and other NATO countries that border Ukraine. U.S. and European officials have been closed-mouthed about the methods and routes they are taking, hoping to avoid Russian targeting.

Asked if he was confident the supply convoys were safe, Sullivan said on CNN, “What I’m confident of is that the United States, our NATO allies and partners, and the Ukrainians have set up a system where we believe we will continue to be able to flow substantial amounts of military assistance and weapons to the front lines to help the Ukrainians ensure that Ukraine is a strategic failure for Vladimir Putin.”

“Of course, these convoys are going through a war zone,” he said. “And so to describe them as safe wouldn’t be quite accurate.”

Among the training center areas that appeared to have been hit were trailers where U.S. troops lived while deployed and a U.S.-funded simulation center used to train Ukrainian soldiers, said a member of the Illinois National Guard who was deployed there from June 2020 to April 2021 and reviewed available imagery Sunday.

An active-duty U.S. soldier who worked at the center on and off from 2014 to 2017 said it has been used for several training programs and was a likely Russian target. “I’m surprised it took them this long,” the soldier said. “Expected it much sooner.” The National Guard member and the soldier spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.

Western-led military training at the center went back even before the establishment of the rotational unit, with U.S. and other forces deploying there to train Ukrainian forces after Russian forces annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. At the time, the move was seen as an initial response by the Obama administration short of sending weapons to the Ukrainians.

The facility is indeed the “main training center where U.S. and Canadian troops have been working with our Ukrainian partners” for the last six to seven years, retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, who served as commander of U.S. Army Europe during the Obama and Trump administrations, said via text.

“It was already an existing training center from Soviet days,” he said. “We and the Ukrainians put a lot of effort into turning it into a modern training area and center that the Ukrainians were now running themselves. The significance of this strike on Yavoriv to me is that it demonstrates that the Russians have the capability to reach that far,” he added, and “probably intended it as a warning to future logistics efforts.”

Elsewhere in Ukraine on Sunday, American journalist Brent Renaud was fatally shot while reporting outside Kyiv, according to the Kyiv region’s police chief and an adviser to the Ukrainian interior minister. Both shared photos of Renaud’s passport and a press badge issued by the New York Times. The Times said in a statement on Twitter that while Renaud had worked with the Times in the past, he was “not on assignment” for the paper in Ukraine.

A second journalist, Juan Arredondo, was with Renaud in Irpin, a Kyiv suburb, when the two came under fire after passing a military checkpoint, according to a video interview that Arredondo did with Italian news outlet Internazionale while being treated in a Kyiv hospital. Ukrainian officials blamed the killing on Russian troops.

Dmytro Kuleba, the Ukrainian foreign minister, accused Russian forces of abducting a second mayor in Dniprorudne, in the southern part of the country. While at least two other Ukrainian officials cited the kidnapping of Mayor Yevhen Matveyev, the reports could not immediately be independently verified by The Washington Post. The alleged abduction came after the mayor of the southern port of Melitopol, was reportedly taken by Russian troops Friday, sparking protests there.

Herman Galushchenko, the Ukrainian energy minister, said in a message posted to Telegram that the power supply had been restored at the defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine. Ukrainian officials said last week that the site was disconnected from the grid by Russian forces, raising concerns that a lack of power would jeopardize the cooling systems for the more than 20,000 spent fuel rods that remain onsite. The reactors revert to diesel backup generators in the event of a power outage.

International Atomic Energy Agency director Rafael Mariano Grossi hailed the “positive development” but said he remains concerned about nuclear security in Ukraine. The country’s regulator said Sunday that staffers at the Chernobyl facility “were no longer carrying out repair and maintenance of safety-related equipment, in part due to their physical and psychological fatigue after working nonstop for nearly three weeks,” the agency stated.

The IAEA had warned that the takeover of power plans in Ukraine, which gets at least half of its electricity from four nuclear facilities, had undermined the key pillars of nuclear safety. Petro Kotin, head of the Ukrainian state-owned atomic energy firm Energoatom, told local media last week that nuclear technicians at the Zaporizhzhia plant in southeast Ukraine were being forced to work at gunpoint.

Galushchenko called on the IAEA, the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to establish a 30-kilometer demilitarized zone around the nuclear power plants in Ukraine.

Meanwhile, Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelensky and member of Kyiv’s delegation to peace talks with Russia, said in a video posted online Sunday that “Russia is starting to talk constructively. I think we will reach some concrete results, literally, in a few days.” His Russian counterpart, Leonid Slutsky, said in an interview with Russian state media Saturday that there had been “significant progress” in the talks.

Ukrainian officials said negotiations with Russia will continue Monday. Ukraine has demanded a cease fire and withdrawal of Russian troops. Russia has called for Ukraine’s demilitarization and pledge not to join NATO, as well as recognition of its annexation of Crimea and independence of Russian-occupied southeastern Ukraine.

Asked Sunday whether the United States would support any concessions made by Ukraine, Sullivan said that the negotiation is the one “that matters because, ultimately, it is Ukraine that will have to make its own sovereign decisions about the shape of any diplomacy going forward.”

IRPIN, Ukraine — The bodies of Russian soldiers were scattered by the wreckage of charred military vehicles and shelled buildings. Twenty feet away, behind tanker trucks, Ukrainian volunteers stood watch, their eyes on a cement mixer about 500 yards away. Behind it were Russian troops on the edges of Bucha, the next town over.

This front line in Irpin, on Kyiv’s northwest outskirts, had not moved in two weeks despite the Russian military superiority. That itself was a victory for Commander Casper and his fighters.

“The Russians were trying to push forward,” said the short, burly unit leader who did not give his full name for security reasons but goes by a nom de guerre. “But they didn’t expect that the Ukrainians were waiting for them.”

When Russian forces seized control of a military airport in Hostomel, a few miles north of Irpin, on the first day of the war, many military observers expected a rapid takeover of Kyiv. But more than two weeks later, Russian troops have struggled to advance.

A visit to two active front lines — Irpin and near Brovary, northeast of the capital’s center — offered insights into the strategies, tactics and capabilities of Ukrainian forces defending Kyiv as well as apparent Russian tactical errors and miscalculations about Ukraine’s resistance.

On Tuesday, Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, announced a citywide curfew until early Thursday in what he called a “difficult and dangerous moment” as Russian forces intensify attacks.

The United States and as many as 20 other nations, mostly NATO and European Union members, have pledged to send Ukrainian forces significant shipments of weaponry, including Javelin antitank missiles, Stinger surface-to-air missiles, machine guns and sniper rifles. It’s unclear how many of these additional arms have reached Ukrainian forces in Kyiv, leaving them to rely on the arsenal at hand and adapt their tactics in the field.

“The Russians were not ready for unconventional warfare,” said Rob Lee, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute and an expert on Russian defense policy. “They were not ready for unconventional tactics. They are not sure how to deal with this insurgency, guerilla-warfare-type situation.”

To be sure, most military analysts and Western officials still predict that Russian forces will eventually encircle Kyiv and push into the capital, possibly aided by airstrikes. While this could prove true, it’s far from clear whether Russia will prevail.

For the Ukrainian forces, this war is one of attrition. They appear to be trying to slow and wear down the Russian military, creating conditions for a stalemate on the outer boundaries of Kyiv. That would buy the Ukrainians time for other pressures on Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Off the battlefield, these include tightening international sanctions on Russia and diplomatic efforts for Russian concessions. On the fronts, Putin’s forces face more Western heavy weaponry delivered to Ukraine, and growing global outrage for killing civilians and bombing residential areas and hospitals — acts that could be war crimes.

In interviews, Ukrainian soldiers also said they capitalize on the Russians’ own flaws, including the use of predictable strategies, a lack of knowledge of local terrain and even a surprising unpreparedness for a grinding conflict. Reports have surfaced on social media and on battlefields of Russian soldiers running out of food, water and fuel for their vehicles. Some have reportedly surrendered after getting lost or losing morale. Russian military convoys have slowed down or halted because of mechanical failures.

“Ukraine’s main game is a game for time,” said Michael Kofman, director of Russian studies at the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) in Arlington, Va. “To try to do something else is going to waste a lot of military potential they have available. Are they in a position to drive Russian forces out of Ukraine? No. Are they in a position to win the war? Yes.”

Across the country, Ukrainian forces have fallen back to the cities, refusing to engage with Russian forces in rural areas, out in the open. While Moscow has gained control of southern cities such as Kherson and Melitopol, it is struggling to take over nearby Mariupol and other hubs across Ukraine, such as Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Sumy.

That is also the case in the southern city of Mykolaiv, where, for more than a week now, Ukrainian forces have prevented a major Russian advance west toward the strategic port of Odessa.

In Kyiv, the seat of government, the stakes could not be higher.

So far, Ukraine’s defenders have blocked Russia’s primary effort: encircle and seize the capital, using the airfield in Hostomel as an air bridge for more tanks, armored vehicles and other weaponry. Ukrainian forces have shot down several Russian helicopters and so far have prevented a major Russian armored column from pressing into the capital. Meanwhile, a solid air-defense system has been mobilized against airstrikes and missile attacks.

“The biggest problem is that [Russia] didn’t organize a proper military operation,” Kofman said. “They thought they were just going to drive in and they weren’t going to get a fight. That led to a lot of disasters because they didn’t plan.”

Seesaw battles have unfolded in the areas of Hostomel, Bucha and Irpin — a possible harbinger of the street-by-street urban warfare that could envelop the capital if Russian forces break through.

On Saturday, large plumes of black smoke rose above the town of Bucha amid the incessant thuds of shells landing. “We have planted antitank mines everywhere,” Casper said with a laugh.

Battle for Brovary

Roughly 40 miles away, on the other side of the capital, Russian forces tried to push into Kyiv from the northeast. A column of tanks moved down a main highway toward the town of Brovary. As they passed a cluster of houses, the Ukrainian forces saw an opportunity.

They pummeled the convoy with artillery shells and antitank missiles, destroying or disabling several tanks and armored personnel carriers. Russian soldiers fled their vehicles and ran into the woods, according to videos posted on social media by Ukraine’s military. One tank slowly rolled to a halt, engulfed in flames. (The videos could not be independently verified but fit with descriptions of the battle provided by Ukrainian fighters and doctors treating the wounded.)

The ambush unveiled the Russians’ ineffective and, at times, inexplicable tactics, military analysts said.

The tanks and other military vehicles were crawling slowly on the open highway, making them an easy target. They also were bunched up close to each other, which allowed a single artillery shell to knock out multiple vehicles. There were also no dismounted infantry troops moving parallel in the woods or alongside the column to detect potential ambushes.

What was also surprising, analysts said, is that some of the tanks were generations old and not well-equipped, including the T-72, a Soviet-era tank that first entered production more than 50 years ago.

“It’s kind of bizarre seeing this,” said Lee of the Foreign Policy Research Institute. “Kyiv is the decisive mission, the decisive objective, and yet they are sending in some very old units to take it.”

The ambush also led to civilian casualties. The Russian soldiers who fled the convoy hid in nearby villages and shot anyone they deemed suspicious. Over the following two days, 23 civilians and soldiers arrived at the Brovary Central District Hospital, many with bullet wounds, said Valentin Baganyuk, the hospital’s director.

They included members of a family shot after they left their house. As the father drove, bullets hit his hand, blowing three fingers off, and wounded him in the head as well. His 14-year-old daughter was also struck. The father managed to drive to safety.

“The Russians targeted them as they tried to escape from their village,” Baganyuk said.

‘Line to defend’

Tucked inside the forests on the northwestern edges of Kyiv, Ukrainian artillery batteries have battered Russian positions inside Irpin and Bucha in attempts to slow a possible advance. The bridge connecting the capital to Irpin was demolished by Ukrainian forces to stop Russian armored vehicles from crossing.

As an added precaution, the road from the destroyed bridge into Kyiv’s center has been barricaded every 100 yards with large concrete blocks, tanker trucks, tires and sandbags.

On the other side of the bridge, at the entrance to Irpin’s center, volunteer armed groups have dug trenches on a hill with a commanding vantage point to strike Russian forces or attempt to ambush them.

In front of the hill, Ukrainian fighters wearing camouflage were positioned behind trees. Other fighters were inside buildings. They looked out on streets that Russians would need to use to move toward Kyiv.

“They have their own line to defend, and we have to keep our position,” said Igor Zadorozhny, 30, a former army officer now defending the city in an armed unit set up by Irpin’s mayor. “Right now, there is a stalemate.”

The conflict is a jumble of small confrontations, often at Ukrainian checkpoints, tit-for-tat artillery shelling and moments of heavy street battles.

“They attack our posts,” said Artiem, 34, a realtor-turned-soldier. “Then we attack them, and they run back.” Like all Ukrainian fighters interviewed by The Washington Post along the front lines, he declined to give his full name for security reasons.

He said Russian forces don’t know Irpin’s geography. At times, they make wrong turns or end up getting stuck on small streets in their tanks and armored vehicles. That has allowed Ukrainian fighters inside buildings to strike them.

The Russians “are disoriented in the city,” Artiem said.

Clutching a rifle, Zadorozhny, the former army officer, said Ukrainian forces were waiting for civilians to evacuate Irpin before “we start to clear the city” of Russians.

“They don’t have enough provisions, food, water,” he said, recounting reports from residents of Russian soldiers looting houses and stores. “They don’t have a lot of gasoline. They will get tired. And then we will go and drive them out.”

Local knowledge of the urban terrain was a major asset for Kyiv’s defenders, Zadorozhny said. “Everything, every stone, every tree is for us,” he said.

Another fighter, 32-year-old Roman, said residents have been providing intelligence to help target the Russians in areas where there is still cellphone reception.

“They are trying to take Kyiv, but they won’t,” Roman said. “Everything is helping us.”

‘Defend our positions’

With Russian ground forces slowed down, another question grows: Will Moscow escalate bombing Kyiv to pressure the government to surrender or flee? So far, the capital has largely escaped the intense barrage of airstrikes and shelling that have hammered cities such as Kharkiv and Chernihiv.

At Casper’s checkpoint, Russian forces have stepped up their attacks. Tanks fired between 20 to 25 shells, demolishing a large blue house next to the Ukrainians’ base on Friday. The Ukrainians didn’t fire back.

“Our goal is to defend our positions, not to attack the Russians,” Casper said.

Such a tactic is smart, military analysts said.

Ukraine’s military cannot compete with the might of Russian weaponry and needs to conserve a much smaller arsenal rather than waste resources on counteroffensives. Casper said they also wanted to keep the road from Bucha open to allow more civilians to flee. Firing back could turn the road into a battle zone, he said.

The Russians, he added, have sent teams to explode Ukrainian mines. But what if Russian tanks do roll down the road toward his checkpoint one day?

Casper smiled and walked to a warehouse. He came out with a British-supplied NLAW antitank missile and a rocket-propelled grenade.

“We know how to greet them,” he said, holding the weapons in his hands. “We have everything right here.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned Russian forces they face a fight to the death if they try to occupy the capital Kyiv, as air raid sirens again woke residents on Sunday morning.

“If they decide to carpet bomb and simply erase the history of this region … and destroy all of us, then they will enter Kyiv. If that’s their goal, let them come in, but they will have to live on this land by themselves,” Zelensky said on Saturday.

The President, who has repeatedly appeared on social media from the capital, said some small towns no longer existed in the third week of Russian attacks, the biggest assault on a European country since World War II.

Russian shelling has trapped thousands of people in besieged cities and sent 2.5 million Ukrainians fleeing to neighbouring countries.

The relentless assault on the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol continues, as Russian forces shell the city’s downtown, including an area around a mosque that was sheltering more than 80 people – some children.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Moscow had warned the United States that Moscow could attack convoys carrying military equipment to Ukraine, calling them “legitimate targets.” US President Joe Biden announced additional aid to Ukraine of up to $US200 million ($275 million) for weapons, military services, education and training.

Russian units fanned out to prepare for an assault on Ukraine’s capital of Kyiv. Zelensky said Russia would need to carpet-bomb Kyiv and kill its residents to take the city.

Here are some key things to know about the conflict:

What are Putin and Zelensky saying?

Putin participated in a 90-minute phone call on Saturday with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Macron’s office said the call was “very frank and also difficult”.

The Kremlin said Putin laid out his demands for ending the war, including Ukraine’s demilitarisation. Moscow has also demanded that Ukraine drop its bid to join NATO, adopt a neutral status and acknowledge Russian sovereignty over Crimea, among other things. Putin also threatened to seize the assets of US and Western companies that have announced plans to leave Russia.

Zelensky again deplored NATO’s refusal to declare a no-fly zone over Ukraine. He said Ukraine had sought ways to procure air defence assets, though he didn’t elaborate.

Zelensky also told Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett that he would be open to meeting Putin in Jerusalem to discuss an end to the war, but that first there would have to be a cease-fire. Putin has ignored Zelensky’s previous offers to talk.

“Ukraine will stand this test. We need time and strength to break the war machine that has come to our land,” Zelensky said during his nightly address to the nation on Saturday.

What is happening in besieged Mariupol?

Russian shelling of this Ukrainian port city of 430,000 has been relentless, and the mayor’s office says more than 1500 have died since the siege began. Russian forces hammered the city’s downtown on Saturday (Sunday AEDT) as residents hid.

The Ukrainian government said a mosque where people sought shelter in the city’s centre was shelled. However, an unverified Instagram post by a man claiming to be the mosque association’s president said the mosque itself wasn’t hit, but a bomb fell about 700 meters away. The Ukrainian embassy in Turkey said 86 Turkish nationals, including 34 children, were among those who had sought safety in the mosque.

Repeated attempts to bring food to Mariupol and evacuate civilians have been cancelled due to ongoing Russian fire. The unceasing shelling has even interrupted efforts to bury the dead in mass graves.

On Saturday, a Ukrainian official said Russian soldiers blocked a humanitarian convoy headed for Mariupol and stole from another. Doctors Without Borders said some residents were dying for lack of medication, with the city without drinking water or medicine for more than a week now. The aid group says people are resorting to boiling water from the ground or extracted from heating pipes.

Ukraine’s military said Russian forces captured Mariupol’s eastern outskirts. Taking Mariupol and other ports on the Azov Sea would be strategic for Putin, as it could allow Russia to establish a land corridor to Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.

An Associated Press journalist witnessed tanks firing on a nine-storey apartment block in Mariupol and was with a group of medical workers who came under sniper fire on Friday. Conditions at a local hospital there were deteriorating, electricity was reserved for operating tables and the hallways were lined with people with nowhere else to go.

Anastasiya Erashova wept and trembled as she held a sleeping child. Shelling had just killed her other child as well as her brother’s child. “No one was able to save them,” she said.

In Irpin, on the north-west outskirts of Kyiv, bodies laid in the open in a park and on a street on Saturday. Serhy Protsenko walked his neighbourhood as explosions sounded.

“When I woke up in the morning, everything was covered in smoke, everything was dark. We don’t know who is shooting and where,” he said. “We don’t have any radio or information.”

What else is happening on the ground?

In the north-east, Russian forces were blockading Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, even as efforts have been made to create new humanitarian corridors around it and other urban centres.

Ukraine’s emergency services reported that the bodies of five people were pulled from an apartment building that was struck by shelling in Kharkiv, including two women, a man and two children.

In multiple areas around Kyiv, heavy artillery fire sent residents scurrying for shelter as air raid sirens wailed. An ammunition depot outside the city was shelled overnight, sending billowing black smoke into the sky, according to video provided by emergency workers.

Britain’s Defence Ministry said Russian ground forces that had been north of Kyiv for most of the war had edged to within 25 kilometres of the city centre and spread out, probably to support an attempted encirclement.

The most vulnerable

Ukraine’s chief prosecutor’s office says at least 79 children have been killed since the invasion began on February 24. At least 2.5 million people have fled the country, according to the United Nations refugee agency.

About 60 child cancer patients from Ukraine boarded a medical train on Saturday in Medyka, Poland, bound for hospitals in Warsaw and elsewhere. Medical workers carried some children in their arms, on stretchers and pushed them in wheelchairs at the train station near the Ukrainian border.

Dominik Daszuta, an anaesthesiologist from Warsaw Hospital, said the train had so far transported 120 children with cancer.

Ukraine’s Defence Ministry said on Saturday that Russian forces shelled a convoy of refugees fleeing Peremoha, a village about 20 kilometres north-east of Kyiv, killing seven people including a child.

The seven were among hundreds of people who tried to leave Peremoha. An unknown number of people were wounded, the report added.

Moscow has said it would establish humanitarian corridors out of conflict zones, but Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of disrupting those paths and firing on civilians.

Elena Yurchuk, a nurse from the northern city of Chernihiv, was in a Romanian train station on Saturday with her teenage son, Nikita, doubting that their home was still standing. Her hometown has been heavily shelled.

“We have nowhere to go back to. Nothing left,” said Yurchuk, 44, who hopes to find work in Germany.",https://www.afr.com/world/europe/russia-terrorises-ukraine-in-war-of-annihilation-20220313-p5a45h

Cohen', 'Meghann Myers']",2022-03-15 00:00:00,"Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine and his push to upend the broader security order in Europe may lead to a historic shift in American thinking about defense of the continent. Depending on how far Putin goes, this could mean a buildup of U.S. military power in Europe not seen since the Cold War.

The prospect of a bigger U.S. military footprint in Europe is a remarkable turnaround from just two years ago.

In 2020, President Donald Trump ordered thousands of American troops out of Germany as part of his argument that Europeans were undeserving allies. Just days after taking office, President Joe Biden stopped the withdrawal before it could start, and his administration has stressed NATO’s importance even as Biden identifies China as the main long-term threat to U.S. security.

Then came Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

“We are in a new era of sustained confrontation with Russia,” says Alexander Vershbow, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia and former deputy secretary-general of NATO. He argues that the United States, in cooperation with NATO allies, will need to establish a more muscular stance to deal with a more threatening Russia. That is especially so in Eastern Europe, where Russia’s proximity poses a problem for the three Baltic nations that are former Soviet states.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was flying to Europe on Tuesday for his second recent round of Ukraine consultations at NATO headquarters in Brussels. He also will travel to two Eastern European NATO countries — Slovakia, which borders Ukraine, and Bulgaria, which does not. After a NATO meeting last month, Austin visited two other allies on the eastern flank — Poland and Lithuania.

As Austin was en route, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg made it clear Tuesday that the 30-nation military alliance is set to radically change its security stance in Europe in response to Russia’s war on Ukraine. He said defense ministers will discuss possible changes when they meet Wednesday.

“We need to reset our military posture for this new reality,” Stoltenberg told reporters. “On land, this could include substantially more forces in the eastern part of the alliance, at higher readiness, and with more prepositioned equipment.”

He added that NATO “will also consider major increases to our air and naval deployments, strengthening our integrated air and missile defense, reinforcing our cyber defenses, and holding more and larger exercises.”

In just the past two months, the U.S. presence in Europe has jumped from about 80,000 troops to about 100,000, which is nearly as many as were there in 1997 when the United States and its NATO allies began an expansion of the alliance that Putin says threatens Russia and must be reversed. By comparison, in 1991, the year the Soviet Union dissolved, the United States had 305,000 troops in Europe, including 224,000 in Germany alone, according to Pentagon records. The number then dropped steadily, reaching 101,000 in 2005 and about 64,000 as recently as 2020.

This year’s U.S. troop additions are billed as temporary, but there’s no certainty how long they’ll stay. They include an armored brigade of the 1st Infantry Division, totaling about 4,000 soldiers, to Germany, and a similar-size infantry brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division, to Poland. Numerous Army headquarters units also have been sent to Poland and Germany. Austin also sent F-35A fighter jets to NATO’s eastern flank and Apache attack helicopters to the Baltic states.

A recent Pentagon review of its worldwide military presence concluded that troop levels and positions in Europe were about right. But in testimony before a House committee several days after Putin invaded Ukraine, Mara Karlin, a senior Pentagon official who oversaw the 2021 review, said that conclusion will have to be reconsidered.

The Pentagon must “ensure that we’ve got deterrence of Russia and that we can absolutely 150% say that NATO is safe and secure,” not just in light of Russia’s invasion but for the longer term, she said March 1.

Putin’s war in Ukraine has prompted a rethinking of regional defense needs not just by Washington but also some European allies, including Germany, which last month broke with a longstanding policy of not exporting weapons to conflict zones by sending anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons to Ukraine. Germany also committed to a much bigger defense budget.

“A new reality,” Chancellor Olaf Scholz declared.

Putin has not only demanded that Ukraine disavow its ambition to join NATO but also insisted the alliance withdraw its forces from NATO’s eastern flank — demands the U.S. and NATO reject as counter to the fundamental rights of nations to decide their foreign relations for themselves and of NATO’s basic commitment to provide security for all members equally.

If Russia were to take control of the entirety of Ukraine, it would be on the border of additional NATO countries, including Romania, Slovakia and Hungary. Poland and Lithuania already share a land border with the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, headquarters of the Baltic Fleet of the Russian Navy. There is concern that Putin could decide to make a play for control of that 60-mile-long land corridor, known as the Suwalki Gap, that connects Kaliningrad to Belarus.

Vershbow, the former deputy NATO secretary-general who is now a distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council, recommends that the U.S. and NATO move beyond their current reliance on light, battalion-size battle groups in Eastern Europe to instead deploy heavier, larger and permanent forces there.

Such a transition on NATO’s eastern flank is just the sort of thing Putin says is a threat to Russia and says he will no longer tolerate. He has demanded a return to the arrangements that existed in 1997, when the NATO-Russia Founding Act was signed.

In that document, Moscow acknowledged that NATO would go ahead with plans to invite Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to join the alliance. Notably, the document also said that “in the foreseeable security environment,” NATO would forgo “additional permanent stationing of substantial combat forces on the territory of new members.”

Does that foreclose the option of a U.S. troop buildup in Eastern Europe? No, says a new report by the Atlantic Council’s Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security. It argues that the restrictions on NATO’s military presence in Eastern Europe as described in the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act are irrelevant in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

An AFP journalist reporting from a protest in the capital Moscow witnessed at least a dozen arrests and said police were taking away anybody without press papers. A young woman was shouting “peace to the world” as she was taken away by two policemen, the journalist said.

Some of the riot police had the letter “Z” in the colors of the Russian flag on their helmets, the AFP reporter said. The letter, seen on Russian tanks and vehicles in Ukraine, has become a symbol of support for what Moscow calls its “special military operation.”

Law enforcement in Moscow said Sunday evening they had detained around 300 people in the capital’s center for breaches of public order. In Russia’s second city Saint Petersburg, AFP saw multiple arrests, including a protester being dragged across the ground. According to AFP, several journalists were detained.

The number of people protesting nationwide appeared to be far fewer than the last major protests a week ago, when OVD-Info listed more than 5,000 people who were detained.

Protests were also staged in Warsaw, London and the German cities of Frankfurt, Hamburg and Stuttgart.

In Rome, Pope Francis decried the “barbarianism” of the killing of children and other defenseless civilians in Ukraine. He told a crowd estimated by the Vatican to number 25,000 people gathered in St. Peter’s Square for his customary Sunday noon appearance that the attacks must stop “before cities are reduced to cemeteries.”

In Cyprus, dozens of Russian nationals joined Ukrainians in the coastal resort town of Limassol Sunday to protest the war in Ukraine. About 50 Russians converged on Limassol’s promenade prior to joining with other protesters to chant slogans such as “Stop the war, stop Putin” and waving blue and white flags they said were the Russian national flag without the red stripe that represented “blood and violence.”

Protester Evgeniya Shlikava, who has been living and working in Cyprus for five years, told The Associated Press that despite Russian propaganda, Ukraine “didn’t deserve this action from our government” and that protesters demand an immediate end to the war “that we don’t support.”

“I do believe that the person who did the most to make Russia weak and not united is (Vladimir) Putin himself,” said Shlikava, who faulted the Russian president and his supporters for bringing the world’s wrath on a Russia proud of its humanistic values and culture. “But now Russia is the aggressor for the whole world, and we protest it.”

Earlier Sunday, Ukrainian nationals in Taiwan and supporters also staged a march in Taipei to protest the Russian invasion.

Meanwhile, Russia said Sunday that negotiators were making headway at talks to resolve the fighting in Ukraine.

Leonid Slutsky, a senior member of Russia’s negotiating team, told the state-run television network RT that “significant progress” was made following several rounds of talks hosted on the border of neighboring Belarus.

“If we compare the positions of both delegations at the start of the talks and now, we see significant progress,” he told the network according to Russian news agencies.

“My own expectations are that this progress could develop over the next few days into a unified position held by both delegations in documents to be signed,” agencies cited him as saying.

Negotiators from Moscow and Kyiv have held several rounds of talks since Putin sent in troops to the country. Turkey this week hosted a first meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers.

Earlier Sunday, a senior Ukraine adviser and presidential aide, Mikhailo Podolyak, wrote on Twitter that Russia had stopped issuing “ultimatums” and instead “carefully listens to our positions.”

In Russia, where demonstrations against the war in Ukraine have been typically met with a heavy police response, rights group OVD-Info said more than 668 people had been detained in 36 cities as of late afternoon Moscow time.

There was a heavy police presence at central locations including Manezhnaya Square near the Kremlin, with officers carrying demonstrators away to waiting police vans, in video posted by Russian media. The number of people protesting nationwide appeared to be far fewer than the last major protests a week ago, when OVD-Info listed more than 5,000 people who were detained.

Anti-war protests were also staged in Warsaw, London and the German cities of Frankfurt, Hamburg and Stuttgart.

A small far-right party organized a protest in Serbia’s capital, Belgrade, in support of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The occupants of dozens of cars waved Russian and Serbian flags, honked horns and chanted slogans in favor of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some cars had “Z” painted on them — the letter is used on Russian armored vehicles in Ukraine and is now a symbol of support for Russian troops.

Despite formally seeking European Union membership, Serbia has refused to join international sanctions against its ally Russia despite voting in favor of the United Nations resolution condemning Moscow’s aggression. The country’s dominant state-controlled media carry frequent pro-Russia reports about the war.

One day after rallies in Florence and Naples, Italians and Ukrainians who live in Italy turned out for protests in Milan and Rome on Sunday against the war in Ukraine.

In the first row of a march in Milan, Italy’s financial capital, protesters held bloodied cloth bundles to represent children killed in Russian attacks on Ukrainians. Some children held drawings, and many marchers streaked their cheeks in the colors of the Ukrainian flag.

Before the march, protesters stretched out an enormous, rainbow-colored peace flag in a Milan square.

In Rome’s march, one of the participants held a cardboard sign that read, “Close the Sky,” an apparent reference to Ukraine’s plea to NATO to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine against Russian warplanes. Italy’s government, like that of fellow NATO allies, has ruled out a no-fly zone option, contending such a move would risk vastly widening the conflict in Europe.

Pope Francis decried the “barbarianism” of the killing of children and other defenseless civilians in Ukraine.

Summary Companies Escalation of war could have big impact on assets

Impact on supply agreement with Gazprom unclear

Situation manageable for now - chairman

Shares flat after net debt erased

ESSEN, Germany, March 15 (Reuters) - RWE (RWEG.DE), Germany's top power producer and a buyer of Russian gas, warned on Tuesday of major consequences for its business should the war in Ukraine escalate, adding stopping energy imports from Russia would hit German industry hard.

The utility said current risks were manageable, but an escalation would have ""notable effects on our assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss.""

RWE, while publishing its final annual results, also said it wouldn't enter into new supply deals with Russian counterparties and had decided to end all non-energy ties with counterparties there with immediate effect.

""However, we must unfortunately also acknowledge that there is a strong dependence on Russia, especially in energy supply, in Europe and in particular in Germany,"" Chief Executive Markus Krebber said at the company's annual press conference.

Krebber said a sudden stop of Russian energy imports would hit household heat supplies and deal a major blow to Germany's industry, which depends on Russian gas.

RWE shares were little changed in a weaker market, with analysts pointing to the fact it had turned net debt into 400 million euros ($440 million) of cash by the end of last year.

The company, which generates power from renewables, nuclear and gas, said it was identifying power plants that could be restarted or run for longer to ensure security of supply and enable Germany to cut reliance on Russian gas.

It said it was unclear what impact the crisis would have on its long-term gas purchase agreement with Russia's Gazprom , adding it had the option of negotiating price adjustments during review periods.

Overall, RWE's commodity exposure to Russia includes 15 terawatt hours of gas deliveries by 2023 and 12 million tonnes of hard coal by 2025. One gas contract with Gazprom was currently dormant, it said. read more

RWE said it could not be ruled out that contractual partners would become insolvent as a result of sanctions that have been imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special operation"".

While a sudden stop of energy imports from Russia would have a limited impact on its business, the broader impact of the Ukraine crisis was difficult to assess and had not yet been factored into its 2022 outlook, RWE said.

Kramer', 'Mike Ives', 'Alexandra Stevenson', 'John Yoon', 'Azi Paybarah', 'David Moll']",2022-03-03 00:00:00,"A fire broke out early Friday at a complex in southern Ukraine housing Europe’s largest nuclear power plant after Russian troops fired on the area, and the Russian military later took control of the site, Ukrainian officials said.

Security camera footage verified by The New York Times showed a building ablaze inside the Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex near a line of military vehicles. The videos appeared to show people in the vehicles firing at buildings in the power plant. Ukraine’s state emergency service later said the blaze went out after 6 a.m.

The fire did not affect essential equipment at the plant, the International Atomic Energy Agency said on Twitter, citing its communication with the Ukrainian government.

About an hour after dawn, Ukraine’s nuclear regulatory inspectorate said in a statement that Russian military forces were now occupying the complex. It said that all of the site’s power units remained intact and that no changes in radiation levels had been observed.

The fire broke out after a Russian attack on a training building outside the perimeter of the plant, according to a statement by Ukraine’s state emergency service. A spokesman for the nuclear plant, Andriy Tuz, was quoted by The Associated Press as telling Ukrainian television that shells had set fire to one of the plant’s six reactors that was under renovation and not operating.

Ukraine’s nuclear inspectorate later said in its statement that one unit of the six units was operating, another was in “outage,” two were being cooled down, and two others had been disconnected from the grid.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine had accused the Russian military of deliberately attacking the complex and said an explosion there would have been “the end for everybody, the end of Europe.”

“Only immediate actions by Europe could stop the Russian army,” he added.

President Biden spoke with Mr. Zelensky about the fire and joined him in urging Russia to “cease its military activities in the area and allow firefighters and emergency responders to access the site,” the White House said. Local reports later said that emergency crews had gained access.

Mr. Biden’s energy secretary, Jennifer M. Granholm, said on Twitter that the United States had not detected elevated radiation readings in the area, echoing an earlier assessment by the International Atomic Energy Agency. “The plant’s reactors are protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down,” she said.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain said he would seek an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council about the blaze at the complex, according to his office.

Before the fire was reported by Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, the director general for the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement that “a large number of Russian tanks and infantry” had entered Enerhodar, a town next to the plant. The director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said that troops were “moving directly” toward the reactor site.

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex, on the Dnieper River roughly a hundred miles north of Crimea, is the largest in Europe. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, its six reactors produce a total of 6,000 megawatts of electric power.

In comparison, the Chernobyl plant in northern Ukraine produced 3,800 megawatts — about a third less. (A megawatt, one million watts, is enough power to light 10,000 hundred-watt bulbs.) The four reactors of the Chernobyl complex were shut down after one suffered a catastrophic fire and meltdown in 1986.

The reactors’ cores are full of highly radioactive fuel. But an additional danger at the Zaporizhzhia site is the many acres of open pools of water behind the complex where spent fuel rods have been cooled for years. Experts fear that errant shells or missiles that hit such sites could set off radiological disasters.

For days, social media reports have detailed how the residents of Enerhodar set up a giant barrier of tires, vehicles and metal barricades to try to block a Russian advance into the city and the reactor site. Christoph Koettl, a visual investigator for The New York Times, noted on Twitter that the barricades were so large that they could be seen from outer space by orbiting satellites.

Starting this past Sunday, three days into the invasion, Ukraine’s nuclear regulator began reporting an unusual rate of disconnection: Six of the nation’s 15 reactors were offline. On Tuesday, the Zaporizhzhia facility was the site with the most reactors offline.

A young Ivan Liachko in his hometown Kyiv, Ukraine

When Ivan Liachko was 11 years old, his parents gathered up him and his younger brother and the belongings they could carry and left the political instability of their home in Kyiv, Ukraine, which was then part of the Soviet Union. In 1990, the family emigrated to the United States, where young Ivan took up new roots. A year later, the Soviet Union fell. Liachko recalls how strange it was to hold a passport issued by a place that no longer existed.

In the U.S., Liachko excelled at science, eventually earning his B.S. in biology at Brandeis and a Ph.D. in genetics from Cornell. His career in academia was fruitful. He expanded the field of high-throughput screening of DNA replication origins during his postdoc at Cornell and continued that work as a Senior Fellow at the University of Washington’s Department of Genome Sciences.

Ivan Liachko, Ph.D., Co-Founder & CEO, Phase Genomics In 2015, Liachko co-founded Phase Genomics on the back of his academic research endeavors. The company develops technology for genome and metagenome assembly. In addition to its work in conservation and biodiversity, Phase’s suite of long-range sequencing and computational tools are finding their place in the life sciences. They’re helping researchers understand the relationships between metagenomics and the human microbiome, infectious diseases, antibiotic resistance, and gene function. The tools are also enabling research on the potential of cytogenomics and epigenomics in oncology, guiding the development of precision medicine in the space.

It's a small company with big potential, and Liachko is energized about the work. But the war raging in his homeland is consuming much of his bandwidth, and he’s mobilizing his industry to help.

Helpless To His Homeland

To speak with Liachko, you wouldn’t immediately pick up on the Ukrainian roots. He’s undoubtedly American, but if anything offers a clue to his ancestry, it’s those unmistakable Ukrainian eyes. For the past few weeks, those eyes have taken on an air of worry.

The place where Liachko spent his early formative years is being terrorized by a barrage of missiles and bombs directed by a powerful adversary in Putin’s Russian military. He has many friends and a large extended family there. Some have joined the more than 2 million who have fled to Poland, Hungary, Moldova, Romania, Slovakia, and beyond to Czechia, Germany, and Bulgaria. Many more have stayed put in Ukraine, where they’ve vowed to fight, or at least attempt to survive the onslaught.

Prior to the Russian invasion, Liachko’s friends, family, and former neighbors were living comfortable lives that mirrored your own. They lived in a beautiful country dotted with lovely cities and towns characterized by a mix of historic architecture and modern conveniences. They went to work, they went shopping, they dined out and went to pubs and parks and soccer matches. They walked their dogs, posted selfies on social media, and went on living even as the threat of an invasion loomed.

On February 24, 2022, that all changed. Since that day, millions of families just like yours have been forced to abandon their homes, pets, belongings, and comforts to seek safety. Tens of thousands have taken to deep underground subway stations in Kyiv alone, where they’ve spent days and weeks sheltering from air raids and missile strikes. Tens of thousands more have taken up arms in resistance.

For those who remain in Ukraine, the hallmarks of a young democratic economy have come to a screeching halt. Grocery stores are wiped clean, their supply chains disrupted. Banking networks are broken, restricting access to cash. The streets of Ukraine’s cities are unsafe. The civilian death toll—already in the thousands—climbs by the hour. Its people have been cut off from the lifelines we take for granted.

A Biotech Leader Takes Action

Obviously, none of this sits well with Liachko, a successful Ukrainian-American academic and biotech entrepreneur living comfortably in his Seattle home, nearly 6,000 miles from his native city in distress. At first, he watched helplessly. There seemed little he could do but attempt to wire funds directly to his friends and relatives there, in hopes they could use that money to buy food, or fare to escape.

Then, as images of the carnage in Kyiv, Odessa, Luhansk, and other cities under siege in his homeland made their way to the U.S., Liachko’s employees and colleagues here in the States began asking questions. They were looking for direction, wondering how they could help.

That’s when Liachko took action as the leader that he is. He announced that Phase Genomics would make matching contributions to any donations its employees made to Ukrainian relief efforts. It didn’t matter if employees chose to support the UNHCR (the UN Refugee Agency), the Ukrainian-American nonprofit Razom, the Voices of Children Foundation, or any other organization providing aid and relief. Phase Genomics would match their donation dollar-for-dollar.

The response among the 25 employees at Phase Genomics was immediate. “Our associates gave, and they gave generously,” says Liachko. “Their contributions to a worthy cause are making a difference for people in need, and the ongoing rally has pulled the team closer and boosted morale here.”

Now, Liachko and Phase Genomics are taking the initiative beyond their four walls. The company has launched a social media campaign inciting the leaders of other companies—biotech and otherwise—to mirror its giving program. It’s a concerted, albeit informal, grassroots effort. “We’re not counting the money. We’re not interested in vanity metrics,” says Liachko. “We just want to make company leaders in biotech and beyond aware that there’s an easy way to initiate an impact by mirroring the effort here at Phase Genomics—a simple company match of dollars sent directly to organizations aiding the citizens of Ukraine. And, in a refugee situation like this, a hundred dollars might feed a few families for a week.”

The response indicates growing interest and action, as individuals inspired by the effort at Phase Genomics report their own private donations and share that they’re imploring their organizations to take up the cause. Others in Liachko’s social circles have been inspired to create job boards for Ukrainian scientists and researchers and post laboratory opportunities to host them.

155,f600d51e-9541-41b8-b812-bf0b0e5e38da,[],2022-03-15 00:00:00,"BERLIN — Nils Schmid, a member of Germany’s parliament and a foreign policy spokesman for the Social Democratic Party, was explaining to me what a minor role the military plays in his country’s politics.

There is a “huge distance, vis-a-vis all things military, in German society,” Mr. Schmid said.

That could soon change. Shortly after Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, Germany’s Social Democratic chancellor, Olaf Scholz, announced a radical shift in his country’s national security stance. Germany, he said, would arm Ukraine, ending its policy of not sending lethal weapons to conflict zones. It would ramp up military spending to more than 2% of its gross domestic product. “It is clear that we must invest much more in the security of our country,” he said.

Germany is not alone in ramping up its defense. Denmark has announced plans to increase military spending to 2% of GDP, a target set by NATO that most member states haven’t hit. Sweden, which is not a part of NATO, also intends to increase military spending to 2%, and the country’s prime minister said young people should be prepared to do military service.

But Germany’s sudden foreign policy transformation is particularly astonishing. Since World War II, militarism has been deeply taboo in Germany. And the country has felt a special responsibility to Russia because of Soviet losses in that war.

For years, Mr. Schmid said, there was an implicit bargain in Germany’s relationship with Russia: “We acknowledged our responsibility from history, and the Soviet Union and then Russia sort of granted us the benefit of accepting that this is a new Germany and that we could enter into a normal relationship.”

Mr. Putin’s attack on Ukraine has made that determination void. Now many compare the feeling in Germany to that in the United States after 9/11, minus the patriotic chest beating. (I’ve seen far more Ukrainian flags in Berlin this week than German ones.)

In the United States, Mr. Putin’s aggression and Ukraine’s heroic resistance have elicited horror but also strains of triumphalism. After years of American decline and self-doubt, a period when political momentum at home and abroad seemed to be with pro-Putin authoritarian populists like Donald Trump, some seem to welcome a renewed sense of moral clarity.

I don’t think there’s much talk of positive consequences in Germany, however. “Europeans know there is no complete security in Europe against Russia,” said Klaus Scharioth, who served as Germany’s ambassador to the United States during the George W. Bush and Barack Obama presidencies. “You can unite, we all do that, which is absolutely necessary, but if Russia stays on the current path, then nobody is secure, because they have all these tactical nuclear weapons. They have also intermediate-range nuclear weapons. And they can, if they want to, they can destroy any European city within minutes.”

Germany has reason to be proud of its reception of Ukrainian refugees, reprising the “willkommenskultur” that led it to accept 1 million Middle Eastern and North African refugees in 2015. A large section of the Hauptbahnhof train station has been transformed into a makeshift refugee processing center. Last Wednesday evening, countless volunteers — wearing yellow vests if they speak only German or English, orange if they speak Russian or Ukrainian — helped new arrivals navigate toward free accommodations in Berlin or buses onward. But the scene is still unspeakably sad. Hundreds of people newly forced from their homes milled around, some laden with baggage, others with only rolling suitcases. Families were slumped on the floor. Some people clutched pets. The catastrophe they had fled wasn’t that far away; Berlin is closer to Lviv than to Paris.

“We live in a different world now,” said Ricarda Lang, a co-leader of the German Green Party, when I met her at a pro-Ukraine protest outside the Russian Embassy. “I, as a person who was born in 1994, I grew up in a peaceful Europe. For me, peace and democracy in many ways were something that was taken for granted.” Such assurance, she said, has now disappeared. Mr. Putin has murdered a whole constellation of post-Cold War assumptions. No one knows what new paradigms will replace them.

Reports: Russia requests Chinese military support

US officials was quoted by media outlets, including the Financial Times, the Washington Post and the New York Times, as saying that Moscow had asked Beijing for military equipment since it invaded Ukraine on February 24.

The spokesperson for China's embassy in Washington, Liu Pengyu, responded to the reports by saying, ""I've never heard of that.""

Pengyu told reporters that the situation in Ukraine was ""disconcerting"" and that China's priority was to prevent it from ""escalating or even getting out of control.""

Instagram now blocked in Russia

Social network app Instagram is now blocked in Russia following similar bans on Facebook and Twitter.

This was confirmed by the NetBlocks cybersecurity watchdog and Russian Instagram users early on Monday.

Russian media regulator Roskomnadzor announced the step on Friday, saying it would come into effect on Sunday at midnight. The regulator justified the measure saying that calls for violence against Russian citizens were being made from the network.

The step follows a decision by Meta, the company that owns Instagram, to allow for calls for violence against Russian troops.

In a Sunday statement published by Russian news agency TASS, Roskomnadzor pointed out that Russia has its own social network platforms such as Vkontakte and Odnoklassniki, and encouraged users to find ""new ways of communicating"" after losing access to Instagram.

Previously, Podolyak and Russian negotiator Leonid Slutsky both confirmed there was progress and that results could materialize in the coming days.

Report: Ukraine using facial recognition software Clearview AI

Ukraine has begun using Clearview AI, a facial recognition developed by a US startup, as a tool to identify Russian assailants and victims of the ongoing Russian invasion.

Clearview AI [Artificial Intelligence] told the Reuters new agency it has provided the tool to Ukraine's Defense Ministry.

Ukraine gets free access to the platform's search engine for faces, which can let authorities vet people of interest at checkpoints, among other uses. However, the details on how Ukraine is utilizing the technology were not immediately known.

Clearview's founder and CEO Hoan Ton-That said his platform has more than 2 billion images from the Russian social media service VKontakte at its disposal, out of a database of over 10 billion photos.

However, critics have warned that facial recognition is not yet 100% accurate, which could lead to people being wrongly identified. Clearview has been facing lawsuits in the US for allegedly violating people's privacy by using their images from the web.

Zelenskyy calls on software giants to step up Russia boycott

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on Microsoft, SAP and Oracle to stop offering support for their products in Russia.

In a tweet, Zelenskyy called out the tech giants, saying there can be ""no 'half' decisions or 'halftones'! [grey areas] There is only black and white, good or evil!""

Last week, Microsoft and SAP said they would stop sales of their products and services in Russia, while Oracle suspended its operations in the country.

However, Zelenskyy was referring to the support for products delivered remotely, via software updates and international help desks. It is unclear whether these services have been suspended.

Kremlin: Too early to confirm Putin-Zelenskyy meeting

At the talks between Moscow and Kyiv, negotiators were also discussing the possibility a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Kremlin said.

Moscow is not ruling out the idea, according to Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov.

However, ""we need to understand what should be the result and what will be discussed at this meeting,"" the spokesman was quoted as saying but the Interfax news agency.

Peskov told the agency it was too early to discuss the outcome of the efforts to set up a meeting.

Earlier on Sunday, both sides signaled cease-fire talks were making headway.

Moscow also said talks would continue on Monday by video link.

IMF: Russia could default on foreign debt

The head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Kristalina Georgieva said Russia is at risk of a deep recession that might make it unable to pay its debts.

""We no longer think of Russian default as improbable,"" Georgieva said in an interview with US broadcaster CBS.

As well as targeting key Kremlin figures and Russian oligarchs, many of the punitive measures will likely cripple Russia's financial system.

The measures helped send the rouble crashing against other currencies, which has already ""significantly diminished"" the purchasing power of the Russian people, Georgieva added.

The Russian central bank's foreign exchange reserves are largely blocked and servicing government debt has become increasingly complicated.

Last week, Morgan Stanley said a Russian default could come as early as next month.

Hundreds arrested at anti-war protests across Russia

More than 800 people were detained during peace rallies across Russia.

OVD-Info, which monitors arrests during protests, said police had held 817 people during demonstrations in 37 cities.

There was a heavy police presence at central Moscow locations including Manezhnaya Square near the Kremlin, with officers carrying demonstrators away to waiting police vans, in footage posted by Russian media.

Protesters risk fines and possible prison sentences by taking to the streets against what Moscow calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.

The number of people protesting appeared to be far fewer than a week ago. Over 14,000 people have been detained across Russia since the invasion started on February 24, according to OVD-Info.

Kyiv: Broken power line at Chernobyl repaired

Ukraine says it has fixed a broken power line to the Chernobyl power plant, which has been seized by Russian troops.

Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said that ''heroes'' from the national power grid company managed to restore the connection.

In 1986, the now-decommissioned facility in northern Ukraine was the scene of the worst nuclear meltdown in history that killed hundreds and spread a radioactive cloud west across Europe.

Nowadays, outside power is directed into the facility to run pumps which keep spent nuclear fuel cool and prevent radiation leaks.

The UN's atomic watchdog said the broken line had ""no critical impact on safety.""

But there were concerns when Russia seized control of Chernobyl that Moscow may attempt to sabotage the facility.

Mariupol evacuation delayed once again

A humanitarian convoy carrying aid, along with evacuation buses, once again failed to reach the besieged port city of Mariupol due to Russian shelling, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on national TV.

""The column has stayed in (the Russian-occupied city of) Berdiansk, and will tomorrow again attempt to reach Mariupol,” she said.

Vereshchuk said more than 140,000 civilians were evacuated from other conflict zones, including several thousand from towns close to the capital Kyiv.

The International Committee of the Red Cross has warned that Mariupol faces ""a worst-case scenario"" if the warring parties don't urgently reach a ""concrete humanitarian agreement.""

The port city of around half a million has been under siege since early this month.

Pro-Russian protest held in Belgrade

A far-right group has staged a protest in Serbia's capital in support of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Several dozen vehicles flying Serbian and Russian flags took part in the ""ride in support of Russia"" convoy through the central streets of Belgrade. The letters Z and V used by Russian forces on their vehicles in the conflicts in Ukraine were visible on the vehicles.

Despite formally seeking EU membership, Serbia has refused to join international sanctions against its traditional ally Russia. However, it did vote in favor of the UN resolution condemning Moscow's aggression.

Meanwhile, Serbia's president said AirSerbia will reduce its flights to Moscow, two weeks after it doubled its service to the Russian capital and introduced larger aircraft to cater to the increased demand.

Beside some Turkish carriers, AirSerbia is the only European airline that has kept on flying to Russia since the international flight ban was announced.

Russia confirms attack on Ukrainian military facility

Russia said its forces hit a military training facility in western Ukraine, near the Polish border.

Defense ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov said the strike at the Yavoriv base had killed ""up to 180 foreign mercenaries"" and a ""large amount of foreign weapons were destroyed.""

The statement could not be independently verified.

A Ukrainian regional governor said 35 people were killed and 134 wounded in the attack, which involved more than 30 Russian cruise missiles.

Mariupol officials say death toll has almost doubled in the besieged city

More than 2,100 residents of Ukraine's city of Mariupol have been killed since hostilities began, the local authorities have said.

""As of today, 2,187 Mariupol residents have died from attacks by Russia,"" the city council posted on Telegram, raising the toll by almost 1,000 since Wednesday, when they said 1,207 civilians had died in the first nine days of the siege.

These numbers could not be independently verified.

""People have been in a difficult situation for 12 days. There is no electricity, water or heating in the city. There is almost no mobile communication. The last reserves of food and water are running out,"" the council said.

Russian forces have continued to shell non-military targets in the southern port city and several attempts at civilian evacuations have failed due to the fighting.

Taking Mariupol and other ports on the Azov Sea could allow Russia to establish a land corridor to Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.

""We will not concede in principle on any positions,"" Ukrainian negotiator and presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said in a video posted online. He added that the Kremlin now understands this and ""is already beginning to talk constructively.""

""I think that we will achieve some results literally in a matter of days,"" he said.

Russia's Interfax news agency cited a Russian delegate, Leonid Slutsky, as saying the talks had made substantial progress.

""According to my personal expectations, in the coming days this progress may grow into a joint position of both delegations, into documents for signing,"" Slutsky said.

Neither side indicated what the scope of any agreement might be.

Missile attack near Lviv

An area outside the major western Ukrainian city of Lviv was targeted by a missile attack early Sunday.

Eight missiles are believed to have been fired at Ukraine's Center for International Peacekeeping and Security, according to Lviv's Regional Military Administration on Telegram. The center is located in Yavoriv, not far from the Polish border and some 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Lviv.

Lviv regional governor Maksym Kozytskyy said on Telegram that 35 people have died in the strike and a further 134 were injured.

The strike on the military base could possibly be a Russian message intended for NATO. The US and other NATO countries previously conducted training exercises with the Ukrainian military at the center called Rapid Trident 21, according to the US Army website.

A Ukrainian general cited by the US army website said the Rapid Trident 21 exercises held at the Yavoriv center were ""not just another stage of military skills improvement, but also an important step towards Ukraine's European integration.""

Ukraine's defense minister said in a tweet that ""foreign instructors"" work at the training center. A NATO official told Reuters news agency that there was no alliance personnel at the base.

The mayor of Ivano-Frankivsk, Ruslan Martsinkiv, said on Facebook that the western Ukrainian city's airport was also targeted in an attack early Sunday.

He said Ukrainians were resisting Russian forces with courage and determination, but the coming days could get worse.

Stoltenberg also dismissed recent ""absurd claims"" by Moscow that the US was secretly operating laboratories in Ukraine to make chemical and biological weapons.

""Now that these false allegations have been made, we must remain vigilant, because it is possible that Russia itself could be conducting missions with chemical weapons under this tissue of lie,"" he said.

He also rejected calls for NATO to impose and enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine. ""That could mean a direct confrontation and escalation. We need to end this war, not let it expand,"" he added.

Zelenskyy warns of new pro-Russia 'pseudo republics' in Ukraine

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed fellow Ukrainians in an online speech and reiterated their right to live in their land on their own terms.

Zelenskyy also said Russian forces would create new people's republics in captured territories, similar to those operating in Donetsk and Luhansk since 2014. Moscow recognized the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk ""people's republics"" immediately before its invasion of Ukraine.

""The occupiers on the territory of the Kherson region are trying to repeat the sad experience of the formation of pseudo republics,"" Zelenskyy said.

""They are blackmailing local leaders, putting pressure on deputies, looking for someone to bribe,"" he added.

Zelenskyy said such ""pseudo republics"" would end up being isolated from the rest of the world and face poverty, crime and exodus.

Zelenskyy said the withdrawal of IT professionals, businesses and artists from Russia was the fate that awaited Donetsk and Luhansk as well.

Towns and villages in the Kherson region have been under occupation by Russian troops since the first days of the war.

Urging Ukrainians to continue their fight, he said they would regain what is theirs. ""Ukraine will not forget. Ukraine will find and prosecute,"" he said.

Zelenskyy said the agreed-upon humanitarian corridors worked and that aid would be arriving in Mariupol on Sunday.

The bridge to cross the Irpin river near Hostomel, in the northwest of Kyiv, has been destroyed, according to a satellite image shared by US-based Maxar technologies and obtained by CNN on 10 March.

A separate on-ground image shared by Ukrainian military officials, and cited by the nonprofit Ukrainian Military Centre on 13 March, showed the destroyed pontoon bridge.

In addition, nearby Russian military vehicles also appear to be destroyed.

The pontoon bridge — a floating bridge made for the movement of troops and vehicles on strategic waterways — was located in an open field about 8km north of the main bridge across the Irpin river.

The Ukrainian military in Irpin has so far managed to hold fort in the city and foil attempts at advancing towards Kyiv.

This is the second location where the Russians have reportedly built a pontoon bridge to move the military vehicles.

Days before the invasion, concerns had emerged from the west after Russia had built a pontoon bridge across the Pripyat river, just 6km from the Ukrainian border and some 23km from a Chernobyl reactor number four.

Reports of the destruction of the bridge come as Russia continued to conduct artillery strikes on suburbs northwest of Kyiv overnight, even as peace talks between Russia and Ukraine are expected to continue on Monday.

Oleksiy Kuleba, a regional administration chief for the Ukrainian city of Brovary, said airstrikes continued on the northwest towns of Irpin, Bucha and Hostomel overnight and a town councilor was killed in the fighting.

At least four Russian planes and three helicopters were destroyed on 13 March, Ukrainian officials said on Monday as the general staff of Ukraine‘s armed forces said Moscow has not been able to make major advancement despite strikes.

Meanwhile, Russia’s defence ministry said its forces killed up to 180 “foreign mercenaries” and destroyed foreign weapons.

And we have communicated to Beijing that we will not stand by and allow any country to compensate Russia for its losses from the economic sanctions,” Sullivan said.

Sullivan said the US has made it clear to Beijing there will ""absolutely be consequences"" for ""large-scale"" efforts to give the Kremlin a workaround to US sanctions.

""We will not allow that to go forward and allow there to be a lifeline to Russia from these economic sanctions from any country anywhere in the world,"" he said.

Sullivan is set to meet with his Chinese counterpart Yang Jiechi in Rome Monday.

Chinese embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu told CNN Sunday he had not heard of Russia's request.

""I've never heard of that. China is deeply concerned and grieved on the Ukraine situation. We sincerely hope that the situation will ease and peace will return at an early date,"" Pengyu said. ""The current situation in Ukraine is indeed disconcerting. Utmost efforts should be made to support Russia and Ukraine in carrying forward negotiations despite the difficult situation to produce a peaceful outcome. We support and encourage all efforts that are conducive to a peaceful settlement of the crisis. The high priority now is to prevent the tense situation from escalating or even getting out of control. There is consensus about this among the international community, including the parties concerned.”

“China calls for exercising utmost restraint and preventing a massive humanitarian crisis. China has put forward an initiative for responding to the humanitarian situation in Ukraine. China has provided Ukraine with humanitarian assistance, and will continue to do so,” Pengyu said.

The White House said last week China was “abiding by the requirements that have been put in place” over sanctions.

Invading Russian troops have redeployed off the main road north of Kyiv, moving into towns and forests as Ukrainian defenders have thwarted their attempts to move south with air and ground attacks.

Ukraine's authorities accused Russia of preventing the evacuation of people from the heavily besieged port city of Mariupol in the south of the country. Conditions in the city are dire, with civilians trapped there. Food, water and electricity are scarce.

More than 1,500 people have died in Mariupol from siege attacks so far, the Associated Press reported Sunday, citing the mayor's office.

163,1c4c7f86-df68-4318-ae13-9fda8003a148,[],,"Geneva-Brussels, March 16, 2022 – As the Russian Federation extends its control of Ukrainian territories a systematic policy of grave human rights violations is unfolding. At least six cases of enforced disappearances and four extrajudicial killings of civilians have been documented in the recently occupied regions of Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Kyiv and Luhansk. These patterns are similar to those already documented in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine since 2014, where torture, kidnappings and executions have become the norm under Russian occupation.

As the Russian army secures control over some territories in Ukraine, the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and its Ukrainian partners have documented at least six cases of enforced disappearances and incommunicado arbitrary detention, as well as at least four extrajudicial executions of journalists, human rights defenders and representatives of local authorities in March 2022 alone. This very worrying trend indicates that the Russian forces may be as negligent of human rights in the occupation of these territories as they were during the conflict, when the army shelled civilians and humanitarian corridors.

Grave human rights violations targeting human rights defenders, journalists and activists

On March 12, 2022, Oleg Baturin, a Ukrainian journalist working for the Novy Den newspaper and member of the National Union of Journalists of Ukraine (NUJU), was allegedly abducted by Russian soldiers in the Kherson region. At about 4 pm, Oleg Baturin received a call from an acquaintance who proposed to meet him at a bus station located near the journalist’s house, in the town of Kakhovka. Oleg Baturin left his phone and documents at home, and promised to be back in 20 minutes. The journalist’s whereabouts have remained unknown since then. On the same day, at around 4:50 pm, Russian soldiers were seen by locals near the Kakhovka bus station, where Oleg Baturin was supposed to meet his acquaintance.

On the same day, a pro-Ukrainian activist and journalist Serhiy Tsyhipa disappeared in the neighbouring town of Nova Kakhovka, in the Kherson region. Serhiy Tsyhipa left home with his dog at 10 am. The dog was later found tied up near the building of the town executive committee. Serhiy Tsyhipa has not been in touch since then, and his family has no official information about his whereabouts. His daughter found out that he was being held in detention in Kherson in order to prevent him from spreading unwanted information about the war in the region. Before his enforced disappearance he covered the news of the occupied town.

On March 11, 2022, at 3 pm, the Russian military abducted Ivan Fedorov, the Mayor of Melitopol town, by breaking into the town hall. According to the Mayor’s Office of Melitopol, the Russian military pulled a black plastic bag over Fedorov’s head, forced him out of his office, put him in a car and drove him away in an unknown direction. This version seemed to be corroborated by a video from security cameras. On March 14, 2022, the Ukrainian authorities reported that Ivan Fedorov was detained in the occupied town of Luhansk and was charged with “terrorism”. It should be noted that, shortly before his arrest, Ivan Fedorov refused to issue a statement legitimizing the Russian invasion. On March 16, 2022, the Office of the President of Ukraine reported that Ivan Fedorov was released in exchange for 9 captured Russian soldiers.

On March 12, 2022, Olga Haisumova, Head of the NGO ""Melitopol Conscious Society"" and one of organizers of a pro-Ukrainian protest in occupied Melitopol, was kidnapped by Russian soldiers straight from the protest rally in Melitopol . Her whereabouts have remained unknown since then. NGO ""Melitopol Conscious Society"" conducted charitable collections of food and financial support for the Ukrainian army, and coordinated civil actions in support of the sovereignty of Ukraine.

According to Ukrainian media reports, rallies against the Russian invasion have been met with violence. Russian troops tried to disperse protesters by shooting in the air. One participant to a pro-Ukrainian rally in Kherson was wounded in the leg by a rubber bullet.

Grave human rights violations targeting Ukrainian political representatives

Ukrainian media report that on the morning of March 13, 2022, the Head of the Melitopol District Council Serhiy Pryima was detained by eight Russian military men who broke into his apartment to conduct a raid. During the raid, the military confiscated all his documents and mobile devices, and demanded his passwords. After the raid, the Russian military took Serhiy Pryyma away in an unknown direction. His whereabouts have remained unknown since then.

On March 13, 2022, the Head of the Zaporizhzhia Regional State Administration announced that the Russian military had kidnapped Yevhen Matveyev, the Mayor of the Dniprorudne town in the Zaporizhzhia Region. On March 14, 2022, Ukrainian authorities reported that his whereabouts remained unknown.

Member of Parliament Dmytro Lubinets informed Ukrainian human rights organisations about the detention by the Russian military of more than 20 pro-Ukrainian activists in the city of Volnovakha in the Donetsk region. Their names are unknown and this information could not be verified upon publication of this note.

Cases of extrajudicial executions of local politicians and civil activists have also been confirmed in the Kyiv and Luhansk regions.

The local self-government body of the Gostomel village, in the Kyiv region, reported that on March 7, 2022, Yuriy Prylypko, the Head of this local self-government, was shot dead by the Russian military along with two volunteers Ruslan Karpenko and Ivan Zorya, while they were delivering food and medicine to local residents.

On March 13, 2022, the Head of the Luhansk Regional State Administration reported that the Russian military had killed pro-Ukrainian activist Oleksandr Kononov, who was shot dead in his wheelchair in his home near Severodonetsk city, Luhansk region.

Conclusions and recommendations

The above-mentioned attacks seem to demonstrate that in the territories under Russian military control, two groups of civilians are particularly targeted: 1) local authorities or opinion leaders who openly oppose collaboration with the occupiers, and 2) pro-Ukrainian activists and humanitarian volunteers who provide assistance to the civilian population.

The OMCT recalls that similar attacks have been documented in Russian-occupied Crimea and eastern Ukraine since 2014.

More wide-scale persecution of civilian population is to be feared in the territories fallen under Russian control, in the form of attacks, enforced disappearances, torture and extrajudicial executions.

We call on the international community to urge the authorities of the Russian Federation to:

Immediately and unconditionally release all the above-mentioned persons; Guarantee in all circumstances their physical integrity and psychological well-being as well as that of all civilians, including human rights defenders, pro-Ukrainian activists, journalists and representatives of local self-government bodies in Ukrainian territories under Russian control; Ensure international monitoring and humanitarian work in Ukraine without any hindrance or reprisals.

We further call on the international community to provide support to Ukrainian non-governmental organisations in all forms relevant in the present-day situation of armed conflict.",https://www.omct.org/en/resources/statements/ukraine-grave-human-rights-violations-in-territories-under-recent-russian-control

Alexander Kononov was shot and killed at his home in the village of Borivskyi in the Luhansk region, eastern Ukraine, said the Governor of Luhansk Oblast, Serhiy Haidai.

Kononov, who for years delivered water, food and medicine to Ukrainian soldiers fighting pro-Moscow militants in Luhansk, was murdered in his wheelchair by invading Russian soldiers, the governor told Ukrainian broadcaster Hromadske.

'Alexander Kononov, Ukrainian volunteer, killed by Russians in his own house in Borivskyi, near Severodonetsk,' Governor Haidai said on Facebook.

Konovov lost his right arm and left leg after suffering from an accident at a steel plant in Ukraine and had later volunteered to help Ukrainian forces who were fighting against pro-Russian rebels since 2014.

During the war, the volunteer was captured by the so-called Luhansk People's Republic militants at a checkpoint and tortured.

After 98 days, in October 2014, Konovov was released from captivity in exchange for other captives, according to local media.

Konovov's death comes as American freelance journalist, Brent Renaud, 50, was shot dead by Russian troops on Sunday while filming refugees in Irpin, a suburb of the Ukrainian capital of Kiev.

Renaud was in a car with other journalists in Irpin, near Kyiv, when Russian troops opened fire. He was shot dead and one of his colleagues was injured.

A Ukrainian mayor was also abducted by invading Russian forces on Sunday, the second such kidnapping in days, bringing strong condemnation from the UK, EU and Zelensky.

Dmytro Kuleba, Minister of Foreign Affairs in Ukraine, said Yevhen Matveyev, the mayor of Dniprorudne in southern Ukraine, was taken days after Ivan Fedorov, the mayor of the nearby city of Melitopol, was also kidnapped.

Meanwhile, Russian missiles today also hit a large Ukrainian base near the border with NATO member Poland on Sunday, killing 35 people and wounding 134, a local official said, in an escalation of the war

The International Center for Peacekeeping and Security served as a crucial hub for cooperation between Ukraine and the NATO countries supporting it in its defence against Moscow's grinding assault.

More than 30 Russian cruise missiles targeted the sprawling facility, which has long been used to train Ukrainian military personnel, often with instructors from the U.S. and other countries in the western alliance.

Poland is also a transit route for Western military aid to Ukraine, and the strikes followed Moscow's threats to target those shipments.

An attack so close to the border was heavy with symbolism in a conflict that has revived old Cold War rivalries that gave birth to NATO and threatened to rewrite the current global security order.

Meanwhile, British Prime Minister told Zelensky that Putin's 'barbaric actions' were 'testing not just Ukraine but all of humanity'.

The Prime Minister spoke to the Ukrainian president on Sunday afternoon, according to No 10.

'He commended the president and the Ukrainian people on their fortitude. The Prime Minister said Putin's barbaric actions were testing not just Ukraine but all of humanity,' a Downing Street spokesman said.

'The leaders condemned the murders of Brent Renaud and countless innocent Ukrainians, and the abduction of the mayors of Dniprorudne and Melitopol.

'The Prime Minister outlined the support the UK continues to deliver to Ukraine. He said the UK would continue to pursue more options for bolstering Ukraine's self-defence, working with partners including at Tuesday's meeting of the Joint Expeditionary Force in London.

'The Prime Minister said the UK would continue to stand behind Ukraine in all their efforts to bring an end to this disastrous conflict.'

Since Russia's invasion more than two weeks ago, at least 596 civilians have been killed, according to the U.N., though it believes the true toll is much higher. Millions more have fled their homes amid the largest land conflict in Europe since World War II.

Despite its superior firepower, Russia has struggled in its advance across Ukraine, in the face of stiffer than expected resistance, bolstered by Western weapons support.

Instead, Russian forces have besieged several cities and pummeled them with strikes, hitting two dozen medical facilities and leading to a series of humanitarian crises.

Many civilians have been caught in the barrage, and Ukraine's Prosecutor General's office said Sunday that at least 85 children have been killed.

An American journalist was killed and another wounded when their car was fired upon at a Russian checkpoint Sunday, police said.

Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden is sending his national security adviser to Rome to meet Monday with a Chinese official amid concerns that country is amplifying Russian disinformation, and Pope Francis called for peace.

The attacked training base near Yavoriv is less than 15 miles from the Polish border and appears to be the westernmost target struck during Russia's 18-day invasion.

The base has hosted international NATO drills and a senior NATO official, Admiral Rob Bauer, previously hailed it as embodying 'the spirit of military cooperation' between Ukraine and international forces.

As such, the site is a potent symbol Russia's longstanding concerns that the 30-member Western military alliance is a threat to Moscow by operating so close to its territory.

NATO denies that it poses any threat, but Russia has repeatedly demanded Ukraine drop its ambitions of joining the alliance as a pre-requisite for ending the war.

Lviv governor Maksym Kozytskyi said most of the Russian missiles fired Sunday 'were shot down because the air defense system worked.' Those that got through killed at least 35 people and wounded 134, he said.

Russian fighters also fired at the airport in the western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, which is less than 94 miles north of Romania and 155 miles from Hungary, countries that also are NATO allies.

NATO said Sunday that it currently does not have any personnel in Ukraine, though the U.S. has increased the number of American troops deployed to Poland.

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the West would respond if Russia's armaments travel outside Ukraine and hit any NATO members, even accidentally.

Biden 'has been clear, repeatedly, that the United States will work with our allies to defend every inch of NATO territory and that means every inch,' Sullivan said on CBS News' 'Face the Nation.'

Lviv itself so far has been spared the scale of destruction unfolding to its east and south. The city's population of 721,000 has swelled during the war with residents escaping bombarded population centers and as a waystation for the nearly 2.6 million people who have fled the country.

Ukrainian and European leaders have pushed with limited success for Russia to grant safe passage to civilians trapped by fighting, though Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said authorities have managed to evacuate nearly 125,000 people from combat zones.

Ukrainian authorities said more than 10 humanitarian corridors would open Sunday, with agreement from Russia, including from the battered and besieged port city of Mariupol, where the city council said 2,187 people have been killed.

The suffering in the port city is 'simply immense,' the International Committee of the Red Cross said Sunday, noting that hundreds of thousands of its residents are 'facing extreme or total shortages of basic necessities like food, water and medicine.'

'Dead bodies, of civilians and combatants, remain trapped under the rubble or lying in the open where they fell,' the Geneva-based organization said in a statement. 'Life-changing injuries and chronic, debilitating conditions cannot be treated.'

Zelenskyy said in a video address that a convoy carrying 100 tons of humanitarian aid was headed to the city, whose capture could help Russia establish a land corridor to Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.

Meanwhile, continued fighting on multiple fronts heaped further misery on the country Sunday and provoked renewed international outrage.

In the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv, near the Black Sea, authorities reported nine people killed in bombings. Meanwhile, they said Russian airstrikes on a monastery and a children's resort in the eastern Donetsk region hit spots where monks and others were sheltering, wounding 32 people.

Around the capital, Kyiv, a major political and strategic target for the invasion, fighting also intensified, with overnight shelling in the northwestern suburbs and a missile strike Sunday that destroyed a warehouse to the east.

Kyiv Region police said on its official website that Russian troops opened fire on a car carrying two American journalists. The force said Brent Renaud died and Juan Arredondo was wounded.

Chief regional administrator Oleksiy Kuleba said Russian forces appeared to be trying to blockade and paralyze the capital with day and night shelling of the suburbs.

He vowed that any all-out assault would meet stiff resistance, saying: 'We're getting ready to defend Kyiv, and we're prepared to fight for ourselves.'

Zelenskyy also alleged that Russians were using blackmail and bribery in an attempt to force local officials in the southern Kherson region to form a 'pseudo-republic' like those in the two eastern regions where Russian-backed separatists began fighting Ukrainian forces in 2014.

Zelenskyy reported Saturday that 1,300 Ukrainian soldiers had died in the war. The Russians said days ago that several hundred of their forces have died but have not given a recent updated count.

The war has repeatedly raised the specter of nuclear accidents, as fighting occurred around nuclear power plants.

On Sunday, Ukraine said it restored a broken power line to the decommissioned Chernobyl plant, scene of the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986. The plant was knocked off the grid last week and relying on generators. That raised concerns about its ability to keep spent fuel cool, though the International Atomic Energy Agency played down those worries.

In some of his strongest denunciations yet of the war in Ukraine, Pope Francis on Sunday decried the 'barbarianism' of the killing of children and other civilians and pleaded for the attacks to end 'before cities are reduced to cemeteries.'

Francis said Mariupol, which 'bears the name' of the Virgin Mary, has 'become a city martyred by the heartbreaking war that is devastating Ukraine.'

In Mariupol, which has endured some of the worst punishment since Russia invaded, efforts to bring food, water and medicine into the port city of 430,000 and to evacuate civilians, were prevented by unceasing attacks.

More than 1,500 people have died in the city during the siege, according to the mayor's office, and the shelling has even interrupted efforts to bury the dead in mass graves.

'They are bombing [Mariupol] 24 hours a day, launching missiles. It is hatred. They kill children,' Zelensky said during a video address.

Ukraine's military said on Saturday that Russian forces captured Mariupol's eastern outskirts, tightening the armed squeeze on the strategic port.

Taking Mariupol and other ports on the Azov Sea could allow Russia to establish a land corridor to Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.

Zelensky encouraged his people to keep up their resistance, which many analysts said has prevented the rapid offensive and military victory the Kremlin likely expected while planning to invade Russia's ex-Soviet neighbor.

'The fact that the whole Ukrainian people resist these invaders has already gone down in history, but we do not have the right to let up our defense, no matter how difficult it may be for us,' he said.

Zelensky again deplored Nato's refusal to declare a no-fly zone over Ukraine and said Ukraine has sought ways to procure air defense assets, though he did not elaborate.

On the morning of March 14, around 11:20 a.m. local time, Ukrainian units struck the center of Donetsk with a Tochka-U tactical missile equipped with cluster munitions. The strike targeted the center of the city, where there is no military infrastructure or equipment. Civilians were deliberately chosen as targets. The nationalist units of the Kiev regime, using cluster munitions, sought to hit as many of the city’s inhabitants in the central part of the city as possible.

The missile was intercepted in mid-air and did not reach its direct target, but even the aerial detonation of the missile, which was equipped with shrapnel cluster munitions, had terrible consequences.

As of now authorities say that at least 20 people were killed, including children, and 26 others were injured in the attack. The numbers of casualties could rise as authorities investigate the scene of the crime.

Forces of the Kyiv government have once again demonstrated why there is no another option to put an end to the violence in the region besides the full demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine.

DPR Head Denis Pushilin said that the missile was equipped with a cluster ammunition warhead. He added that if the missile was not shot down, it would lead to even more casualties.

The leader of the republic, Pushilin, said that the DPR would declare mourning after the missile attack on the city.

DPR authorities consider the strike as a terrorist attack.

“Ukrainian armed formations once again used the Tochka-U tactical missile system on residential areas of Donetsk in order to genocide civilians and destroy important civilian infrastructure,” the statement said.

According to Pushilin, DPR forces have already shot down over 15 Tochka-U missiles launched by Kyiv’s forces. He stated that the missile launching point will be found and eliminated.

DPR authorities also vowed to increase the speed of offensive against Kyiv’s forces.

More photos and videos from the site of the attack:

Almost immidiately after the Tochka-U attack, the Russian Aerospace Forces carried out strikes on positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces near Yasinovataya, located in the countryside of Donetsk:

As long as units of the Kyiv government remain close to residential areas, their actions (both offensive and defensive) will continue to cause civilian casualties. MSM-promoted ‘democratic Ukrainian fighters’ use civilians as human shields and intentionally launch strikes on civilian targets as part of their ordinary military approach.

This crime took place amid the new round of talks between Kyiv and Moscow and followed diplomatic signals by both sides that some kind of ‘compromise’ could be found in the talks. After the March 14 attack, it is hard to expect that the diplomatic process will achieve any fruitful results.

According to Ukrinform, Minister of Energy of Ukraine German Galushchenko said this on Facebook.

""Today, thanks to the incredible efforts of Ukrenergo experts, our nuclear specialists and electricians we managed to restore power supply to the Chornobyl nuclear power plant, which was seized by the Russian occupiers,"" he wrote.

Galushchenko stressed that Ukrainian specialists, risking their own health and lives, were able to avert the risk of a possible nuclear catastrophe that posed a threat to the whole of Europe.

According to the minister, now the cooling systems of spent nuclear fuel assemblies will operate normally again, not from backup power.

Galushchenko stressed that the Chornobyl nuclear power plant is a Ukrainian energy facility, and Ukraine does not need any help from anyone to provide or restore electricity supply to Ukrainian facilities.

""Yes, our energy specialists are really heroes, but it is impossible to ensure nuclear security in the conditions of military aggression. That is why I once again appeal to our international partners, the European Commission, IAEA, UN, OSCE: help us protect nuclear facilities! Now it is extremely necessary to make the enemy leave the nuclear power plant and establish a 30-kilometer demilitarized zone around Ukraine's nuclear power facilities,"" Galushchenko said.

Ukrenergo emphasized that the Chornobyl NPP is an important facility that cannot be left without reliable energy supply.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed Ukrainian specialist teams had succeeded in repairing a power line needed to resume external electricity supplies at the plant, four days after they were lost at the Russian-controlled site.

IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi received the news from Petro Kotin, head of Ukraine’s nuclear power firm Energatom, who told him the specialist teams from transmission system operator Ukrenergo had fixed one of two damaged lines which meant all required off-site power is being delivered to the nuclear plant.

This means the cooling systems will now operate normally and no backup power will be needed.

Mr Grossi said: “This is a positive development as the Chornobyl NPP has had to rely on emergency diesel generators for several days now.

“However, I remain gravely concerned about safety and security at Chornobyl and Ukraine’s other nuclear facilities.”

Staff at the Chernobyl nuclear plant are no longer carrying out repair and maintenance of safety-related equipment, partly due to their physical and psychological fatigue after working non-stop for nearly three weeks.

The director general has proposed a framework that would enable the IAEA to deliver technical and other assistance for the safe and secure operation of all Ukraine’s nuclear facilities during discussions last week with the Ukrainian and Russian Foreign Ministers Dmytro Kuleba and Sergei Lavrov, respectively.

Mr Grossi added: “We can’t afford to lose more time.

With his brother Craig, Renaud spent years ""telling humanistic verite stories from the World's hot spots,"" including projects in Iraq, Afghanistan, Haiti, Egypt, and Libya, according to his website bio. Brent Renaud was a 2019 Harvard Nieman Fellow.

Christof Putzel, a friend and colleague of Renaud, told CNN his passing is a ""devastating loss to journalism today.""

""I woke up this morning to the news that Brent, long-time best friend, incredible colleague, the best war journalist I think ever existed, finding out about his passing. Brent had this ability to go anywhere, get any story, listen and communicate what was happening to people that others wouldn't otherwise see it. And it is a devastating loss to journalism today,"" Putzel told Brian Stelter on CNN's Reliable Sources Sunday.

Putzel said Renaud was working on a documentary about refugees around the world when the crisis in Ukraine hit. He said that ""Brent was on the plane the next day"" and covered the plight of refugees from Kyiv into Poland. A post on the Renaud Brothers' Facebook page, dated March 8, urged readers to follow their coverage of the war Ukraine.

Several years ago, Putzel and Renaud won a duPont Award for a story they worked on about guns being smuggled into Mexico from the US. ""What I said when we accepted our award was, the only thing bigger than Brent's balls are his heart. And I stand by that. That's what kind of journalist he was,"" Putzel said.

He said Renaud had a unique ability to make people trust him as he told their stories in places like Iraq and other war zones. ""You could sit down and spend a week watching all of Brent's stories over the years back-to-back and just be flabbergasted. The career that he had, his ability to reach people, his ability to capture the humanity behind people's suffering is something I have never seen before, and I was just honored to work with him as long as I did,"" Putzel said.

The director of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard said on Sunday that the foundation is ""heartsick"" over the death of American journalist Brent Renaud in Ukraine.

""Our Nieman Fellow Brent Renaud was gifted and kind, and his work was infused with humanity. He was killed today outside Kiev, and the world and journalism are lesser for it. We are heartsick,"" said foundation curator Ann Marie Lipinski in a tweet.

The Committee to Protect Journalists on Sunday condemned the killing of Renaud and called for the killers to be brought to justice.

The New York-based organization said in a statement, ""U.S. reporter Brent Renaud was shot and killed, and another journalist was injured on Sunday in the city of Irpin, outside of Kyiv, according to a Ukrainian police official and news reports. In denouncing the shooting, the Committee to Protect Journalists called for the killers to be brought to justice.""

“We are shocked and saddened to learn of the death of U.S. journalist Brent Renaud in Ukraine. This kind of attack is totally unacceptable, and is a violation of international law,” added the CPJ’s program director Carlos Martinez de la Serna in the statement. “Russian forces in Ukraine must stop all violence against journalists and other civilians at once, and whoever killed Renaud should be held to account.”",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-13-22/h_084674a99f0e28d3116ea0e94cfd5003

The reactor at Chernobyl infamously melted down in April 1986 during a test, covering much of Europe in a radioactive cloud.

At that time, Ukraine remained a part of the Soviet Union, and to this day a highly protected 20-mile exclusion zone had existed around the site, which entombs a highly dangerous amount of nuclear material.

So why would Vladimir Putin have prioritised it for capture and control by his advancing troops?

Tracey German, a professor in conflict and security at the King’s Russia Institute, told The Independent this could be down to the site’s location.

“It lies on a direct route from Belarus down to Kyiv and would therefore be passed by Russian forces invading from the north,” she said. “If it wasn’t in this location, I don’t think Russian forces would be looking to secure it.”

The defunct nuclear site is situated in northern Ukraine just several miles inside the border and around 80 miles north of the embattled country’s capital.

“Chernobyl is the shortest route from Russia to Kyiv. The facility is not the goal,” tweeted CNN analyst and national security expert Juliette Kayyem.

Ukraine observers also say that Chernobyl sits on the western side of the Pripyat river, which merges with the Dneiper river just north of Kiev. The site therefore becomes strategically important for the western flank of Russian troops if they eventually circle the city.

Dr Ross Peel, a researcher at the Department of War Studies at King’s College London’s also suggested the threat posed by war could also play a role.

“I’d suggest the main motivation is they want to get the site secured. It’s not generating power at all and has no value that I can think of – I think the main motivation is they want to keep it safe from anything that might breach it,” he told The Independent.

“Prolonged fighting in the area only creates danger of the containment being breached and radiation escaping, so they want to prevent anything happening to it.”

But Ukraine’s nuclear agency and interior ministry on 25 February said they were recording increased radiation levels from the site of the defunct nuclear power plant.

Experts at the state nuclear agency said the change was due to the movement of heavy military equipment in the area lifting radioactive dust into the air.

“It is not critical for Kyiv for the time being, but we are monitoring,” the interior ministry said.

Other observers have said that Russia wanted to gain control of the Chernobyl power substation, which provides energy to Belarus and parts of western Russia.

Shane Partlow, who used to work at the US embassy in Kyiv, said this could be the purpose of holding the Chernobyl area, as the substation was “critical to electrical supply in the region, including Belarus and Russia”.

On 4 March, Russia also seized Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant - Europe’s largest - in the Ukrainian city of Enerhodar after attacking it in the early hours the morning, setting an adjacent five-storey training facility on fire.

In an emotional speech in the middle of the night, Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky said he feared an explosion at Zaporizhzhia would be “the end for everyone. The end for Europe. The evacuation of Europe”.

Regional military officials said there had been some damage to the compartment of reactor number one in the shelling, but that it did not affect the safety of the power unit.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials said radiation levels in the area were not at dangerous levels, and most experts saw nothing to indicate an impending disaster.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/chernobyl-nuclear-power-plant-russia-control-b2031911.html

With Russian forces occupying one of Ukraine’s four nuclear power plants as well the site of the decommissioned Chernobyl facility, the world is getting an unprecedented look at the first major war to ever take place in a country with an established nuclear power infrastructure.

Ukraine runs 15 nuclear reactors accounting for about half of its electricity generation, according to the World Nuclear Association. But seven of these reactors have been disconnected from the grid since Russian attacks began on February 24 in order to keep them cool.

Last week, the International Atomic Energy Agency and Ukrainian nuclear authorities acknowledged that the six reactors of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant in southeastern Ukraine had fallen into Russian hands after an intense fire fight that saw a training laboratory on plant premises catch fire.

Now, according to reports from the BBC, Russian troops are training their sights on the three reactors South Ukraine nuclear power plant near the city of Mykolaiv in the country’s southern central region.

The Zaporizhzhya plant – which is Europe’s largest nuclear power station – is now surrounded by the invading troops while Ukrainian technicians continue monitoring plant functions from the inside. Ukrainian regulators have claimed that Rosatom, Russia’s state nuclear corporation, has sent engineers to the plant who are now giving orders to the captive staff.

But in a March 12 statement on its website (which may be inaccessible after an attack by the Anonymous hacker group) Rosatom denied that, and characterizing the presence of its engineers at the Ukrainian plant as “consultative assistance” which takes place on “a regular basis.”

Last week, Russian troops detonated ammunition on Zaporizhzhya plant territory that hadn’t exploded during their March 4 attack, though reportedly caused no damage to plant structure. None of the plant’s six reactors, only two of which are currently operational, were affected and there was no radiation leak.

On February 25th, the second day of the invasion, Russian troops overran Chernobyl, which now stores 20,000 spent nuclear fuel rods. The defunct site also houses the remains of the plant’s exploded Number 4 reactor, which is slowly being dismantled under a huge steel dome. The staff that perform those critical activities had been held hostage until last weekend, when about half of them were finally allowed to rotate out after 600 hours on the job since the Russian invasion began.

On two separate occasions, power has been cut to the plant by fighting in the area, leaving critical spent fuel storage pools and radiation ventilation structures without electricity. Power has since been restored, the IAEA reported, but the situation highlights how vulnerable Ukraine’s nuclear facilities are to Russian military aggression.

Now that the coming days could bring the seizure by Russian troops of the South Ukraine plant, we thought it would be useful to revisit our 2018 report on the Ukrainian nuclear industry and highlight the basic characteristics of each of the country’s four Soviet- and Russian-built nuclear power stations.

The Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant

Credit: Ralf1969

Reactor type: Six Soviet/Russian built VVER-1000/320s

Location: The Zaporizhzhya plant is situated on the steppes along the Kakhovka reservoir in the Zaporizhzhya Oblast of Ukraine, near the city of Enerhodar, 690 kilometers southeast of Kyiv. It is the largest nuclear plant in Europe, consisting of six nuclear power units, each with a capacity of 1000 mW. The power produced by the plant provides one fifth of the total power used in Ukraine.

Reactor construction: Soviet authorities adopted the decision to build the plant in 1978 and construction started in 1981. Between 1984 and 1987, Units One, Two, Three and Four were commissioned.

Unit Five was commissioned in 1989 and Unit Six began operations only in 1995, after a post-Chernobyl moratorium on new reactor construction was lifted.

Special spent fuel storage features: The Zaporizhzhya plant is the first in Ukraine to use a dry spent fuel storage facility. Under this scheme, spent fuel elements that have been previously cooled in spent fuel pools for at least five years, during which their residual energy is released, are then transferred to the dry storage facility. There, the assemblies are stored vertically and ventilated by air. The dry spent fuel storage facility at Zaporizhzhya when into service in August of 2001.

Reactor Lifetime extensions: Units One, Two, Four and Five at the Zaporizhzhya plant have received lifetime extensions. Unit One was due to retire in 2015 but will run until 2025. Unit Two was due to retire in 2016 but will run until 2026. Unit Four was due to retire in 2018 but will run until 2028. Unit Five was due to retire in 2028 but will run until 2030. Unit Three was shut down in 2017 for upgrades associated with a lifetime extensions, though one has not yet been granted.

Notable events: The startup of Unit One was delayed by 11 months because of a fire that occurred at the reactor on January 27, 1984. News about the fire was concealed from the public until Gorbachev’s policy of Glasnost began six years later.

In May of 2014, several armed men representing a far-right political group attempted to gain access to the plant but were stopped by Ukrainian police. The plant’s proximity to the fighting that has ground on in the Donbas region for the last eight years, prior to the outbreak of the current war, has made the plant vulnerable to military attack.

How many reactors currently running: Two, both at reduced power.

The Khmelnitsky Nuclear Power Plant

Credit: RLuts

Reactor type: Two Soviet/Russian built VVER-1000s

Location: The Khmelnistky nuclear plant is located in the northern part of the Khmelnitsky region 350 kilometers west of Kyiv in an area of high seismic activity. The plant operates 2 Russian-built VVER-1000 reactors, each produced 1000 mW.

Reactor construction: Soviet authorities adopted the decision to build the plant in 1975 and originally envisioned that it would consist of 4 reactors. Construction on Unit One began in 1981 and finished in 1987, and construction on Unit Two commenced in 1983 but its completion was delayed by a 1990 government-imposed moratorium on new reactor construction. After the moratorium was lifted, construction on Unit Two resumed. But lack of financing protracted the project, and it wasn’t completed until 2005.

The plant’s remaining two reactors were originally planned for construction under a 2011 deal with Atomstroyexport, Russian state nuclear corporation Rosatom’s foreign wing. That deal was annulled in 2015, following Moscow’s annexation of Crimea. A 2016 deal with a Korean power firm to complete the reactors has made little progress.

Also unclear is whether a 2021 deal between the plant and Westinghouse to build an AP 1000 reactor at the site will ever go forward.

Reactor Lifetime Extensions: One reactor at the Khmelnitsky plant has received a lifetime extension. Unit One reactor was scheduled to retire in 2018 but will run until 2028.

Notable Events: In 1987, there was a release of radioactive steam in Unit One’s containment room. The incident was rated by the International Nuclear Event Scale as a 3 its seven-point scale, denoting a “serious” incident with consequences contained within the plant.

How many reactors currently running: One.

The Rivne Nuclear Power Plant

Credit: Victor Korniyenko

Reactor Type: Two Soviet/Russian built VVER 440, two Soviet/Russian built VVER-1000

Location: The Rivne Nuclear plant is located near the town of Varash (known as Kuznetsovsk until 2016) in the Rivne Oblast in Ukraine’s northwest, 390 kilometers west of Kyiv. The combined power of the four units it operates is 2835 mW.

Reactor Construction: The plant operates four reactors, two Soviet-built VVER-440s and two Soviet/Russian-built VVER-1000s. It was the first nuclear plant in Ukraine to see the construction of the VVER series reactor, which were a departure from the Soviet designed graphite moderated RBMK-type reactors, one of which exploded at Chernobyl in 1986.

Originally conceived by the Soviets in 1971 as the West Ukraine nuclear plant, the name was changed to Rivne during commissioning. Construction in 1973 and two VVER-440 units were commissioning in 1980 and 1981. Unit Three, which was the first of the two VVER-1000s, was commissioned in 1986.

Unit Four was scheduled to be commissioned in 1991, but the Ukrainian government’s 1990 moratorium on new reactor builds prevented that. After the moratorium was lifted, construction on Four resumed in 1993, and it finally entered commercial service in 2006.

Reactor Lifetime extensions: Units One, Two and Three at the Rivne plant have received lifetime extensions: Unit One was due to retire in 2010 but will run until 2030. Unit Two was due to retire in 2011 but will run until 2031. Unit Three was due to retire in 2017 but was granted a 20-year extension to run until 2037.

Notable Events: In December of 2010, Units One and Two of the Rivne plant were granted lifetime extensions of 20 years, nearly doubling their original 30 life expectancy, and putting off their decommissioning until the early 2030s. In 2018, Unit Three received an identical extension, putting off its retirement until 2037.

Another safety issue at the plant is the ground on which it stands, which is characterized by shifting soils and sinkholes, which, if not properly monitored, could endanger plant infrastructure.

How many reactors currently running: Three

The South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant

Credit: Xy713

Reactor Type: Three Soviet/Russian built VVER-1000s

Location: The South Ukraine nuclear plant is located near the city of Yuzhnoukrainsk in the Mykolaiv Oblast 350 kilometers south of Kyiv. It is Ukraine’s second largest functioning nuclear plant and is part of the South Ukrainian Energy Complex, along with the Tashlyk Pumped-Storage Power Plant and the Oleksandrivska hydroelectric plant. The plant lies on the steppes on the banks of the Pivdennyi Bug River and its three reactors generate 2850 mW of electicity.

Reactor Construction: Construction of the South Ukraine nuclear plant’s Unit One began in 1975 and was completed in 1983. Units One and Two followed in 1985 and 1989, respectively. A fourth reactor was planned but its construction was suspended by Soviet order.

Reactor lifetime extensions: Two reactors at the South Ukraine nuclear plant have received lifetime extensions and one was shutdown in 2019 to accommodate upgrades toward an extension.

All three reactors at the South Ukraine nuclear plant have received lifetime extensions. Unit One was due to retire in 2013 but will run until 2023. Unit Two was due to retire in 2015 but will run until 2025. Unit Three was due to run until 2020 and is undergoing upgrades that would see it run until 2030.

Notable events: The South Ukraine plant became the first to burn fuel fabricated by western nuclear fuel supplier Westinghouse – part of an effort to wean the Ukrainian industry off its dependents on fuel produced in Russia by TVEL.

In 2005, the plant’s Unit Three was loaded with a mixture of Russian and experimental Westinghouse assemblies for a period of pilot operation. However, the test was unsuccessful with Energoatom, Ukraine’s state nuclear operator, claiming the Westinghouse assemblies had defects. For its part, Westinghouse alleged that its fuel assemblies were loaded incorrectly. This led to a lengthy outage of Unit Three.

Nevertheless, in 2008, Energoatom contracted with Westinghouse for 630 assemblies that would be loaded into the South Ukraine plant’s three reactors.

In 2008 Energoatom and Westinghouse Electric Sweden contracted to ship fresh fuel to as many as six reactors. However, during trial use at South Ukraine NPP in 2012, the fuel became deformed and caused serious damage to the reactor. The use of Westinghouse fuel was then suspended by Ukraine pending its redesign. However, following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, the contract was revived and extended.

Ukraine says that the external power supply to Chernobyl has been restored five days after it was lost after power lines to the area were damaged during fighting.

Diesel generators had been providing back-up electricity to the site.

The damaged power line was initially fixed on 13 March, but Ukraine’s energy company Ukrenergo said it was damaged again ""by the occupying forces"" before the power supply could be fully restored.

However, further work meant that the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine (SNRIU) was able to inform the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) later on 14 March that external power ""had again been restored and that staff at the Chernobyl NPP had restarted operations to reconnect the NPP to the grid"".

The IAEA says that the lack of power did not have a ""critical impact on essential safety functions as the volume of cooling water in its spent fuel storage facility was sufficient to maintain heat removal without a supply of electricity"". But it said the power supply issues underline the urgency of agreeing and implementing a framework proposed by the IAEA to ensure the safety and security of all of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities.

Ukraine’s Energoatom has reported that the country's nuclear power plants continue to operate within safe limits. Eight of the country’s 15 reactors continue to operate.

The IAEA says it has been told by SNRIU about work to find and dispose of unexploded munitions at the Zaporozhe nuclear power plant, which is under the control of Russian forces. It said in its update on the evening of 14 March that it ""was aware of reports that Russian forces have carried out munition explosions at the site … and it is seeking information about the situation from Ukraine"".

Ukrainian state-owned nuclear power company Energoatom has informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that the power supply to the Chornobyl nuclear power plant (NPP) has been restored.

The restoration of the power supply will enable the nuclear plant’s cooling system to run as normal and without requiring backup power.

Ukraine notified the IAEA on 9 March that the power supply to the Chornobyl NPP had been disrupted and the plant had lost its supply of external power, causing concerns that the cooling of the radioactive material at the facility may be disrupted.

The power lines were restored by repair staff at Ukrenergo, the country’s transmission system operator.

Energoatom official Petro Kotin told IAEA director-general Rafael Mariano Grossi that Ukrainian specialist teams have successfully established power lines linked to the Chornobyl NPP.

He added that the external electricity supplies to the Chornobyl NPP have been fixed and will be reconnected to the Ukrainian electricity grid.

Grossi said: “This is a positive development as the Chornobyl NPP has had to rely on emergency diesel generators for several days now.

“However, I remain gravely concerned about safety and security at Chornobyl and Ukraine’s other nuclear facilities.”

Ukraine’s nuclear regulator reported to the IAEA that the staff at the Chornobyl NPP have not been able to leave the facility since 24 February.

The staff have suspended all the repair and maintenance of safety-related equipment due to their physical and psychological conditions.

The regulator noted that there are 211 technical personnel and guards present at the nuclear power facility.

LVIV, Ukraine (UPDATE) - A Russian missile attack on a large Ukrainian military facility near the border with NATO member Poland on Sunday killed 35 people and wounded 134, a Ukrainian official said.

Britain said the incident, just 15 miles (25 km) from the Polish border, marked a ""significant escalation"" of the conflict. U.S. President Joe Biden has said NATO will defend every inch of its territory if Russia's invasion of Ukraine spills over into member states of the Western defense alliance.

Ukraine said foreign military instructors have previously worked at the Yavoriv International Center for Peacekeeping and Security, but a NATO official said there were no personnel from the alliance there. It was not immediately clear whether any non-NATO states might have representatives there.

Regional governor Maksym Kozytskyy said Russian planes fired around 30 rockets at facility, adding that some were intercepted before they hit. At least 35 people were killed and 134 wounded, he said. Reuters was not able to verify his statement.

The 360 square-km (140 square-mile) facility is one Ukraine's biggest and the largest in the western part of the country.

The Kremlin did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the reported missile strike so close to the border with NATO, and a short video briefing by Russia's defense ministry spokesman on Sunday made no mention of such an attack.

Nineteen ambulances with sirens on were seen by Reuters driving from the direction of the Yaroviv facility after the reported strike and black smoke rose from the area.

""Russia has attacked the International Center for Peacekeeping & Security near Lviv. Foreign instructors work here. Information about the victims is being clarified,"" Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said in an online post.

A Ukrainian defense ministry representative told Reuters the ministry was still trying to establish if any foreign instructors were at the centre at the time of the attack.

Ukraine, whose aspirations to join NATO are a major irritant to Russian President Vladimir Putin, held most of its drills with countries in the Western defense alliance at the base before the invasion. The last major exercises were in September.

In the weeks before Russia invaded on Feb. 24, the Ukrainian military trained there, but according to Ukrainian media, all foreign instructors left the training ground in mid-February, while leaving all the equipment.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine, launched by Putin on Feb. 24, has sent more than 2.5 millions fleeing across borders and trapped thousands of people in besieged cities.

While Western nations have sought to isolate Putin by imposing harsh sanctions, the United States and its allies are concerned to avoid NATO being drawn into the conflict. ""There are no NATO personnel in Ukraine,"" the NATO official said, when asked if any NATO personnel were at the base.

Asked how much of an escalation the attack was, UK cabinet minister Michael Gove told a BBC interviewer: ""It is significant."" Putin was pushing the boundaries in military terms, he said.

AIRPORT HIT IN WEST

The mayor of another city in western Ukraine, Ivano-Frankivsk, said Russian troops also continued to hit its airport, with no initial reports of casualties.

In eastern Ukraine, Russian troops are trying to surround Ukrainian forces as they advance from the port of Mariupol in the south and the second city Kharkiv in the north, the UK Defence Ministry said on Sunday.

Kharkhiv has suffered some of the heaviest bombardment. Videos from one resident, Teimur Aliev, who is helping bring aid to residents, show bombed buildings lining streets, burned out cars riddled with shrapnel holes and debris strewn around.

""We will stitch up the wounds and the pain of our country and our city. We are ready to build it and we are ready to renew it when the war is over. We're not going anywhere,"" Aliev, a 23-year-old musician, said of his food distribution network, which now has dozens of volunteers.

British intelligence also said Russian forces advancing from Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, were trying to circumvent Mykolaiv as they look to drive west towards Odesa. Air strikes on Mykolayiv killed nine people on Sunday, regional Governor Vitaliy Kim said in an online statement.

Air raid sirens again woke residents in Kyiv on Sunday morning, hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned Russian forces they face a fight to the death if they try to occupy the capital.

Ukraine accused Russian forces on Saturday of killing seven civilians, including one child, in an attack on women and children trying to flee fighting near Kyiv.

Reuters was unable immediately to verify the report and Russia offered no immediate comment.

Moscow denies targeting civilians. It blames Ukraine for failed attempts to evacuate civilians from encircled cities, an accusation Ukraine and its Western allies strongly reject.

MORE ARMS FOR UKRAINE

The United States said it would rush up to $200 million in additional small arms, anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons to Ukraine, where officials have pleaded for more military aid.

The Kremlin describes its actions as a ""special operation"" to demilitarise and ""deNazify"" Ukraine. Ukraine and Western allies call this a baseless pretext for a war of choice.

Polish President Andrzej Duda warned in an interview broadcast on Sunday that the use of chemical weapons in Ukraine by Russia would be a game changer and NATO would have to think seriously about how to respond.

Russian troops have destroyed 3,687 Ukrainian military infrastructure facilities so far, Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying on Sunday. It was not possible to independently verify his statement.

In a video message posted by news agency AFP on Twitter, Markushyn said no journalist would be let into Irpin because the stream of media content from the city was revealing military positions to the Russians, and that the measure had been taken to prevent risking more Ukrainian lives.

""In this way, we want to save lives for them and our defenders… I very much ask all media representatives, as well as Ukrainians, do not post photos of our servicemen, their equipment or anything that would indicate their location,” Markushyn added.

Irpin, a suburb of Kyiv, has witnessed some of the fiercest fightings since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24.

Renaud, a 50-year-old filmmaker, was shot dead by Russian forces, said Andriy Nebytov, the head of Kyiv's regional police force, on Sunday. Nebytov had posted a picture purportedly of Renaud's body on Facebook, as well as pictures of his American passport and media credentials issued by The New York Times.

However, the Times said that the journalist was not currently working for it.

Russia and Ukraine held a fourth round of talks on Monday even as Moscow’s forces continued to launch a barrage of missiles aimed at Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities.

Ukraine officials said Russian forces have launched more than 900 missiles but that Ukraine’s airspace is still contested, with Russia not achieving total air superiority.

Shortly before dawn on Tuesday, large explosions thundered across Kyiv as Russia pressed its advance on multiple fronts.

According to the United Nations, almost 2.8 million people have left the war-torn country and over 600 have died but the actual toll is expected to be much higher.

A video journalist from the US, Brent Renaud, best known for producing humanitarian stories from conflict zones, was killed in Irpin outside the city of Kyiv in Ukraine, according to Kyiv police official Andriy Nebytov.

“Journalists forbidden from entering Irpin after Russians kill US reporter on March 13. Irpin Mayor Oleksandr Markushyn said the measure was put in place to protect journalists and Ukrainian soldiers alike. Irpin is a satellite town near Kyiv, and a site of fighting,” The Kyiv Independent tweeted.

The police official shared images of the journalist’s body, as well as his press ID and US passport. The press ID showed the reporter as an employee of the New York Times, but the prestigious US daily said that the man was not working for them at the moment of his death, reported DW.

Meanwhile, The New York Times issued a statement saying, “We are deeply saddened to hear of Brent Renaud’s death. Brent was a talented photographer and filmmaker who had contributed to The New York Times over the years.”

“Though he had contributed to The Times in the past (most recently in 2015), he was not on assignment for any desk at The Times in Ukraine. Early reports that he worked for Times circulated because he was wearing a Times press badge that had been issued for an assignment many years ago,” the statement added. (ANI)

Russia has asked China for military assistance in Ukraine, a senior US official said, and the Ukrainian military has thwarted an attempt by Russian military vehicles to cross the Irpin River.

It comes after a day that saw Russia expanding its offensive to western Ukraine, firing missiles near the city of Lviv and hitting a large military base close to the Polish border, reportedly killing dozens of people as the war draws closer to NATO's front line.

If you're just reading in, here are the latest headlines from the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Seeking China's help: Russia has asked China for military assistance in Ukraine, including drones, a senior US official said Sunday. White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the development is a “concern"" and the US has made it clear to Beijing there will ""absolutely be consequences"" for ""large-scale"" efforts to give the Kremlin a workaround to US sanctions. Sullivan will meet Chinese counterparts in Rome on Monday for talks.

When asked by CNN about the reporting of Russia's request for military aid, Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in the US, said in a statement, ""I've never heard of that.""

Chernobyl staff: Staff at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant are so tired they have stopped carrying out the repair and maintenance of safety-related equipment, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said. The 211 technical personnel and guards have still not been able to rotate from the facility since Russian forces entered the site. Ukraine managed to resume the power supply at Chernobyl on Sunday.

Russian forces thwarted: Ukrainian troops stopped an attempt by Russian military vehicles to cross the Irpin River on a pontoon bridge near Hostomel, new satellite images show. Ukrainian forces in Irpin have so far repelled Russian advances toward the capital Kyiv. With the main bridge crossing the Irpin River having been destroyed, the Irpin River poses a significant obstacle for the Russian military.

Ukraine cut off: Britain's Ministry of Defense said Russian forces have blockaded Ukraine’s Black Sea coast, cutting the nation off from international maritime trade.

Zelensky warning to NATO: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said it is only a matter of time before Russia’s military assault on Ukraine expands to members of NATO unless the alliance installs a no-fly zone over his country.

Reports: Russia requests Chinese military support

US officials was quoted by media outlets, including the Financial Times, the Washington Post and the New York Times, as saying that Moscow had asked Beijing for military equipment since it invaded Ukraine on February 24.

The spokesperson for China's embassy in Washington, Liu Pengyu, responded to the reports by saying, ""I've never heard of that.""

Pengyu told reporters that the situation in Ukraine was ""disconcerting"" and that China's priority was to prevent it from ""escalating or even getting out of control.""

The reports came hours after the White House warned Beijing would face severe ""consequences"" if it helps Moscow evade sanctions.

Instagram now blocked in Russia

Social network app Instagram is now blocked in Russia following similar bans on Facebook and Twitter.

This was confirmed by the NetBlocks cybersecurity watchdog and Russian Instagram users early on Monday.

Russian media regulator Roskomnadzor announced the step on Friday, saying it would come into effect on Sunday at midnight. The regulator justified the measure saying that calls for violence against Russian citizens were being made from the network.

The step follows a decision by Meta, the company that owns Instagram, to allow for calls for violence against Russian troops.

In a Sunday statement published by Russian news agency TASS, Roskomnadzor pointed out that Russia has its own social network platforms such as Vkontakte and Odnoklassniki, and encouraged users to find ""new ways of communicating"" after losing access to Instagram.

US President Biden spoke with France's Macron on Ukraine

US President Joe Biden spoke with French counterpart Emmanuel Macron to discuss Russia's war against Ukraine, the White House said on Sunday.

The White House statement said that Macron and Biden would also ""support the government and people of Ukraine.""

Zelenskyy urges no-fly zone, says 'Russian rockets will fall' on NATO territory

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reiterated his demand that NATO impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine and warned that Russia could strike NATO territory.

""If you don't close our sky, it is only a matter of time before Russian rockets fall on your territory, on NATO territory,"" Zelenskyy said in a video address.

Zelenskyy spoke after Russian forces launched air strikes on a military training center in Yavoriv, near Ukraine's border with NATO member Poland.

US condemns Russian missile attack near Polish border

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the US condemned a Russian missile attack near Ukraine's border with Poland.

The missile hit the military training facility in Yavoriv, some 25 kilometers from the Polish border.

""The brutality must stop,"" Blinken said.

Chechen leader Kadyrov says he traveled to Ukraine

Ramzan Kadyrov, leader of Russia's Chechnya region, said on Sunday that he had traveled to Ukraine to meet with Chechen troops.

Chechen television channel Grozny posted a video on its Telegram channel that showed Kadyrov discussing military operations with Chechen troops, which they said took place 7 km from Kyiv.

Chechen fighters have been in Ukraine since 2014, when they entered in support of the pro-Russian secessionist regions in eastern Ukraine. They have also been involved in Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine since February 24.

UK: Ukraine isolated from international maritime trade

The British Defence Ministry said Russian naval forces had established a ""distant blockade of Ukraine's Black Sea Coast"" in a Sunday intelligence update. It added that this effectively isolates Ukraine from international maritime trade.

The ministry said that Russian naval forces are continuing to conduct missile strikes throughout Ukraine.

Russia has already conducted one amphibious landing in the Sea of Azov, according to the ministry, and ""could look to conduct further such operations in the coming weeks.""

Ukraine, Russia negotiators to talk again on Monday

Cease-fire talks between Russia and Ukraine are ongoing via video-link and would continue on Monday, said Ukrainian delegate Mykhailo Podolyak.

""Working groups are constantly functioning,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""A large number of issues require constant attention.""

Previously, Podolyak and Russian negotiator Leonid Slutsky both confirmed there was progress and that results could materialize in the coming days.

Report: Ukraine using facial recognition software Clearview AI

Ukraine has begun using Clearview AI, a facial recognition developed by a US startup, as a tool to identify Russian assailants and victims of the ongoing Russian invasion.

Clearview AI [Artificial Intelligence] told the Reuters new agency it has provided the tool to Ukraine's Defense Ministry.

Ukraine gets free access to the platform's search engine for faces, which can let authorities vet people of interest at checkpoints, among other uses. However, the details on how Ukraine is utilizing the technology were not immediately known.

Clearview's founder and CEO Hoan Ton-That said his platform has more than 2 billion images from the Russian social media service VKontakte at its disposal, out of a database of over 10 billion photos.

However, critics have warned that facial recognition is not yet 100% accurate, which could lead to people being wrongly identified. Clearview has been facing lawsuits in the US for allegedly violating people's privacy by using their images from the web.

Zelenskyy calls on software giants to step up Russia boycott

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on Microsoft, SAP and Oracle to stop offering support for their products in Russia.

In a tweet, Zelenskyy called out the tech giants, saying there can be ""no 'half' decisions or 'halftones'! [grey areas] There is only black and white, good or evil!""

Last week, Microsoft and SAP said they would stop sales of their products and services in Russia, while Oracle suspended its operations in the country.

However, Zelenskyy was referring to the support for products delivered remotely, via software updates and international help desks. It is unclear whether these services have been suspended.

Kremlin: Too early to confirm Putin-Zelenskyy meeting

At the talks between Moscow and Kyiv, negotiators were also discussing the possibility a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Kremlin said.

Moscow is not ruling out the idea, according to Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov.

However, ""we need to understand what should be the result and what will be discussed at this meeting,"" the spokesman was quoted as saying but the Interfax news agency.

Peskov told the agency it was too early to discuss the outcome of the efforts to set up a meeting.

Earlier on Sunday, both sides signaled cease-fire talks were making headway.

Moscow also said talks would continue on Monday by video link.

IMF: Russia could default on foreign debt

The head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Kristalina Georgieva said Russia is at risk of a deep recession that might make it unable to pay its debts.

""We no longer think of Russian default as improbable,"" Georgieva said in an interview with US broadcaster CBS.

As well as targeting key Kremlin figures and Russian oligarchs, many of the punitive measures will likely cripple Russia's financial system.

The measures helped send the rouble crashing against other currencies, which has already ""significantly diminished"" the purchasing power of the Russian people, Georgieva added.

The Russian central bank's foreign exchange reserves are largely blocked and servicing government debt has become increasingly complicated.

Last week, Morgan Stanley said a Russian default could come as early as next month.

Hundreds arrested at anti-war protests across Russia

More than 800 people were detained during peace rallies across Russia.

OVD-Info, which monitors arrests during protests, said police had held 817 people during demonstrations in 37 cities.

There was a heavy police presence at central Moscow locations including Manezhnaya Square near the Kremlin, with officers carrying demonstrators away to waiting police vans, in footage posted by Russian media.

Protesters risk fines and possible prison sentences by taking to the streets against what Moscow calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.

The number of people protesting appeared to be far fewer than a week ago. Over 14,000 people have been detained across Russia since the invasion started on February 24, according to OVD-Info.

Kyiv: Broken power line at Chernobyl repaired

Ukraine says it has fixed a broken power line to the Chernobyl power plant, which has been seized by Russian troops.

Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said that ''heroes'' from the national power grid company managed to restore the connection.

In 1986, the now-decommissioned facility in northern Ukraine was the scene of the worst nuclear meltdown in history that killed hundreds and spread a radioactive cloud west across Europe.

Nowadays, outside power is directed into the facility to run pumps which keep spent nuclear fuel cool and prevent radiation leaks.

The UN's atomic watchdog said the broken line had ""no critical impact on safety.""

But there were concerns when Russia seized control of Chernobyl that Moscow may attempt to sabotage the facility.

Mariupol evacuation delayed once again

A humanitarian convoy carrying aid, along with evacuation buses, once again failed to reach the besieged port city of Mariupol due to Russian shelling, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on national TV.

""The column has stayed in (the Russian-occupied city of) Berdiansk, and will tomorrow again attempt to reach Mariupol,” she said.

Vereshchuk said more than 140,000 civilians were evacuated from other conflict zones, including several thousand from towns close to the capital Kyiv.

The International Committee of the Red Cross has warned that Mariupol faces ""a worst-case scenario"" if the warring parties don't urgently reach a ""concrete humanitarian agreement.""

The port city of around half a million has been under siege since early this month.

Pro-Russian protest held in Belgrade

A far-right group has staged a protest in Serbia's capital in support of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Several dozen vehicles flying Serbian and Russian flags took part in the ""ride in support of Russia"" convoy through the central streets of Belgrade. The letters Z and V used by Russian forces on their vehicles in the conflicts in Ukraine were visible on the vehicles.

Despite formally seeking EU membership, Serbia has refused to join international sanctions against its traditional ally Russia. However, it did vote in favor of the UN resolution condemning Moscow's aggression.

Meanwhile, Serbia's president said AirSerbia will reduce its flights to Moscow, two weeks after it doubled its service to the Russian capital and introduced larger aircraft to cater to the increased demand.

Beside some Turkish carriers, AirSerbia is the only European airline that has kept on flying to Russia since the international flight ban was announced.

Russia confirms attack on Ukrainian military facility

Russia said its forces hit a military training facility in western Ukraine, near the Polish border.

Defense ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov said the strike at the Yavoriv base had killed ""up to 180 foreign mercenaries"" and a ""large amount of foreign weapons were destroyed.""

The statement could not be independently verified.

A Ukrainian regional governor said 35 people were killed and 134 wounded in the attack, which involved more than 30 Russian cruise missiles.

Konashenkov said Russia had used high precision long range weapons to strike Yavoriv and a separate facility in the village of Starichi.

The attack, so close to the border with Poland, appeared to mark a significant escalation in the conflict.

Mariupol officials say death toll has almost doubled in the besieged city

More than 2,100 residents of Ukraine's city of Mariupol have been killed since hostilities began, the local authorities have said.

""As of today, 2,187 Mariupol residents have died from attacks by Russia,"" the city council posted on Telegram, raising the toll by almost 1,000 since Wednesday, when they said 1,207 civilians had died in the first nine days of the siege.

These numbers could not be independently verified.

""People have been in a difficult situation for 12 days. There is no electricity, water or heating in the city. There is almost no mobile communication. The last reserves of food and water are running out,"" the council said.

Russian forces have continued to shell non-military targets in the southern port city and several attempts at civilian evacuations have failed due to the fighting.

Taking Mariupol and other ports on the Azov Sea could allow Russia to establish a land corridor to Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.

The EU fears that the total number of Ukrainian refugees might reach 5 million if the war continues

Russia, Ukraine both speak of progress in cease-fire talks

Russian and Ukrainian officials gave their most optimistic assessments yet of progress on cease-fire talks, suggesting there could be positive results within days.

""We will not concede in principle on any positions,"" Ukrainian negotiator and presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said in a video posted online. He added that the Kremlin now understands this and ""is already beginning to talk constructively.""

""I think that we will achieve some results literally in a matter of days,"" he said.

Russia's Interfax news agency cited a Russian delegate, Leonid Slutsky, as saying the talks had made substantial progress.

""According to my personal expectations, in the coming days this progress may grow into a joint position of both delegations, into documents for signing,"" Slutsky said.

Missile attack near Lviv

An area outside the major western Ukrainian city of Lviv was targeted by a missile attack early Sunday.

Eight missiles are believed to have been fired at Ukraine's Center for International Peacekeeping and Security, according to Lviv's Regional Military Administration on Telegram. The center is located in Yavoriv, not far from the Polish border and some 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Lviv.

Lviv regional governor Maksym Kozytskyy said on Telegram that 35 people have died in the strike and a further 134 were injured.

The strike on the military base could possibly be a Russian message intended for NATO. The US and other NATO countries previously conducted training exercises with the Ukrainian military at the center called Rapid Trident 21, according to the US Army website.

A Ukrainian general cited by the US army website said the Rapid Trident 21 exercises held at the Yavoriv center were ""not just another stage of military skills improvement, but also an important step towards Ukraine's European integration.""

Ukraine's defense minister said in a tweet that ""foreign instructors"" work at the training center. A NATO official told Reuters news agency that there was no alliance personnel at the base.

The mayor of Ivano-Frankivsk, Ruslan Martsinkiv, said on Facebook that the western Ukrainian city's airport was also targeted in an attack early Sunday.

NATO chief warns against 'possible' Russian plan to use chemical weapons

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg expects a further intensification of the fighting and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, he told the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag.

He said Ukrainians were resisting Russian forces with courage and determination, but the coming days could get worse.

Stoltenberg also dismissed recent ""absurd claims"" by Moscow that the US was secretly operating laboratories in Ukraine to make chemical and biological weapons.

""Now that these false allegations have been made, we must remain vigilant, because it is possible that Russia itself could be conducting missions with chemical weapons under this tissue of lie,"" he said.

He also rejected calls for NATO to impose and enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine. ""That could mean a direct confrontation and escalation. We need to end this war, not let it expand,"" he added.

As a message to Russian President Vladimir Putin, he said: ""End this war, withdraw all your forces back and commit to diplomacy.""

Zelenskyy warns of new pro-Russia 'pseudo republics' in Ukraine

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed fellow Ukrainians in an online speech and reiterated their right to live in their land on their own terms.

Zelenskyy also said Russian forces would create new people's republics in captured territories, similar to those operating in Donetsk and Luhansk since 2014. Moscow recognized the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk ""people's republics"" immediately before its invasion of Ukraine.

""The occupiers on the territory of the Kherson region are trying to repeat the sad experience of the formation of pseudo republics,"" Zelenskyy said.

""They are blackmailing local leaders, putting pressure on deputies, looking for someone to bribe,"" he added.

Zelenskyy said such ""pseudo republics"" would end up being isolated from the rest of the world and face poverty, crime and exodus.

Zelenskyy said the withdrawal of IT professionals, businesses and artists from Russia was the fate that awaited Donetsk and Luhansk as well.

Towns and villages in the Kherson region have been under occupation by Russian troops since the first days of the war.

Urging Ukrainians to continue their fight, he said they would regain what is theirs. ""Ukraine will not forget. Ukraine will find and prosecute,"" he said.

Zelenskyy said the agreed-upon humanitarian corridors worked and that aid would be arriving in Mariupol on Sunday.

They also noted that the gravest threat for the city's 400,000 blockaded residents is from the sky, and urged the skies to be closed or for them to be given air defence systems.

The City Council also stated that the situation in Mariupol remains very difficult. There is no light, water, heat in the city, almost no mobile communication, the last stocks of food and water are running out, Ukrinform reported.

The Russians reportedly caused the worst humanitarian catastrophe in Mariupol. Unable to defeat the Ukrainian army, the invaders bomb unarmed people and block humanitarian aid, it said.

More than 2,000 people have died in the city of Mariupol since Russia launched its war in Ukraine, the city council has said, as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) warned that residents of the besieged port city face a “a worst-case scenario” unless the warring parties reach an agreement to ensure their immediate safety and access to humanitarian aid.

“To date, 2,187 Mariupol residents have died from attacks by Russia,” the Mariupol local council said on its official Telegram account on Sunday. Since the war in Ukraine began on February 24, it added, Russian forces have dropped about 100 bombs on the city, including 22 in the previous 24 hours.

Ukrainian authorities say the city has been subject to relentless bombardment since Russian troops surrounded it on March 2. Since then, the roughly 400,000 people who remain in Mariupol have been left with no access to water, food and medicine. Heat, phone services – and electricity in many areas – have been cut.

“The situation is catastrophic; it has been catastrophic for days,” the ICRC’s Jason Straziuso told Al Jazeera. “Even our team is collecting water from streams … but how does everyone do that … especially if you are elderly?” he asked. Straziuso said that his team members were eating one meal per day.

In a statement later on Sunday, the ICRC warned that time was “running out” for those trapped in the city.

“History will look back at what is now happening in Mariupol with horror if no agreement is reached by the sides as quickly as possible.”

ICRC president Peter Maurer called on all parties involved in the fighting to “place humanitarian imperatives first”.

The ICRC said “a concrete, precise, actionable agreement” was needed without delay so civilians wanting to leave can reach safety, and life-saving aid can reach those who stay.

Moscow has repeatedly justified its offensive in Ukraine, saying that it was conducting a “special military operation” attacking military targets. Last week though, Kyiv accused Russia of bombing a children’s hospital and a maternity ward and killing three people, while Mariupol’s local authorities on Thursday reported that city’s residential areas had been shelled “every 30 minutes”.

The capture of the port city is strategically important to Moscow as it would link Russian-backed territories in the east with Russian-annexed Crimea in the south.

Several attempts to establish evacuation corridors to allow civilians to escape the city, and to allow humanitarian aid to enter, have fallen apart as previously agreed ceasefires collapsed.

Ukrainian authorities have accused Russia of deliberately opening fire on aid convoys heading towards Mariupol. Russia has blamed Kyiv for sabotaging ceasefire agreements.

On Sunday, another attempt was under way as Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that a convoy with humanitarian aid was two hours away from Mariupol.

“We’re doing everything to counter occupiers who are even blocking Orthodox priests accompanying this aid, food, water and medicine. There are 100 tonnes of the most necessary things that Ukraine sent to its citizens,” Zelenskyy said in a video address.

The president also said that nearly 125,000 civilians from other cities have been evacuated through safe-passage corridors in one day.

Amid collapsed ceasefires and trade accusations, Mikhail Podolyak, a member of the Ukrainian negotiating team, said on Sunday that there has been some progress in the talks with his team’s Russian counterparts.

The family managed to escape the besieged Ukrainian city on Thursday, but their parents stayed behind.

Having fled northeast to the central city of Dnipro, Tania told CNN that Russia's bombardment has effectively wiped Mariupol off the map, and it's only a matter of time before other cities in Ukraine face the same fate.

""There is no longer any city there. There is no longer a city of Mariupol...there isn't a single residential building left. Only 10% of the people are left there. Just retirees without money or (those without) cars who can't escape (and) people who can't walk,"" Tania said from the relative safety of a temporary shelter in Dnipro.

""We did not bathe for three weeks, (we) went to the toilet on a bucket and in a bag,"" Tania wrote in a diary she updated each day from her underground hiding place. She shared her diary entries with CNN.

The family rarely left the cellar unless it was absolutely necessary to survive -- leaving only to find food and water, and once to help bury neighbors killed by Russian artillery while waiting in line for food.

""The problem is that in our city, we didn't have anything. No mobile connection. No internet connection. Everything was cut. The gas supply, the water supply. The lights,"" Dmytro told CNN. ""We were cooking outside, making the fire. Taking wood from the parks. Because there was no other option to survive -- sharing food with our neighbors, our relatives.""

The couple said it felt like Russian forces were targeting groups of civilians waiting in line for food, water, or at a pharmacy.

""They were just killing us. If we gathered together in a group to find water, they just shot at us,"" Tania said.

Dmytro and Tania Shvets say their apartment came under intense fire in Mariupol and that the building is no longer standing.

On the 11th day of the Russian invasion (March 6), she wrote in her diary: ""A hard attack has begun. They were shooting from everything and everywhere, there was a shelling of houses again. Today there is not a single kiosk left, even empty ones are being opened and people take out everything from there: bags, cartons, vitamins from pharmacies ... looting has become a way of survival.""

""Why the killing of civilians? Why? For what? We respect all (of) the world,"" he told CNN.

Dark jokes become reality

During the first few days of the conflict, Dmytro and Tania joked that if food became scarce, they could always eat pigeons.

""In the beginning it was like a joke. Oh, maybe we'll kill a pigeon to eat,"" Dmytro told CNN.

Now, he said that's no longer a joke, but rather a matter of catching the few pigeons that have survived the incessant Russian attacks.

Dmytro fears his parents and in-laws are going to starve.

""I don't know how they are going to survive. Because there is no food anymore. My dad told me we don't have food. Maybe...one week. Maximum,"" he said with tears in his eyes.

""I don't know if I'm going to see my parents or listen to my parents again. I have no idea,"" he said, adding that they are just living from day to day.

""Today we are alive, tomorrow -- maybe not. Nobody knows,"" he said.

A 'river of blood'

The few times Dmytro left the cellar to search for food and water, he saw crosses made with two wooden sticks, marking fresh graves dug in heavily-shelled residential neighborhoods. This is the only symbol families have available to mark their loved ones' lives.

""We were burying people in front of their gardens, in patios. Our neighbors asked us to help to dig the graves for their sons, for their kids,"" he said.

Tania and Dmytro Shvets escaped from Mariupol on March 18.

Dmytro said a bomb fell in front of him while waiting in line for water, killing three people. He had to help bury them.

Tania added, ""We gathered many corpses, people put them either in ditches or in buildings, while it's cold. Some people from Mariupol took (dead) people in their cars because they want to bury them.""

She said that every day that passed in Mariupol saw more deaths and more damage.

""The rivers of blood flow down the street,"" she wrote in her diary.

Tania thought that she was prepared for war, and she had plenty of cash on hand.

But now she says that she wished she had listened to her grandparents when they told her to always have flour and sugar on hand -- a mentality left over from World War II.

""We didn't know that this would happen... instead of all the money and phones, you need to have two suitcases at home that have batteries, candles, matches, medicine and a change of socks ... you need a suitcase that will save your life. We didn't have matches or candles. Where can you get them when you have money but there are no pharmacies or stores?"" she said.

Escaping

On March 18, Tania and her family left her home city as ""victims"" and ""survivors.""

""This is a cemetery of our relatives, friends, neighbors, residents, buildings. We have buried our dreams, goals, careers... lost everything that has been achieved over the years with hard work,"" she wrote in her diary.

Dmyrtro said the decision to leave the city -- and his parents -- was agonizing, but ""the only option.""

""My mother was completely destroyed mentally, (she) was like (in a) complete depression, sitting in the cellar -- she hasn't left the cellar since the beginning of the war,"" he said.

""The last day I saw my father, he begged, 'please guys, leave somewhere, I don't know where, just escape this, escape this,'"" he said.

It was the first time Dmyrtro saw his father cry. ""He told me 'please... son, just leave...just leave and take your family out.'""

The drive out of the city -- a journey that would normally take 45 minutes by car before the war -- took them 15 hours. It was one roadblock after the other, most manned by what they believe were Russian soldiers.

At one roadblock, Dmytro said he had to take off his shirt to prove to soldiers that he didn't have military or Ukrainian nationalist tattoos. The couple were afraid of their phones being hacked by the Russians, so they deleted everything -- erasing the horror of the previous three weeks -- only keeping their parents' phone numbers.

Vlada Shvets, 7, escaped from Mariupol with her parents.

In Dnipro, the couple's 7-year-old daughter Vlada is missing home. But she understands why they had to leave.

""A small child understands everything, even if he cannot speak because he is too small,"" Vlada said.

""I want the war to end quickly,"" she added.

In the many hours that CNN spent with the family at the temporary shelter in Dnipro, the couple were constantly checking their phones for any communication from their parents still in Mariupol.

As we were about to leave, Dmytro said that Tania had just received a call from her mother who was weeping and saying goodbye, because she did not believe she would survive the night.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/22/europe/mariupol-ukraine-family-escape-intl-cmd/index.html

Asked if Russia could effectively take control of Mariupol, Pavlo Kyrylenko, governor of the Donetsk region, told CNN the city was “no more,” leaving Russians with nothing left to seize.

“The enemy may seize the land Mariupol used to stand on, but the city of Mariupol has been wiped off the face of the earth by the Russian Federation, by those who will never be able to restore it,” he said. “To restore Mariupol, that is something only Ukraine can do.”

Russia has besieged the city on the Sea of Azov since the beginning of the invasion on Feb. 24. Mariupol has seen some of the worst attacks and casualties of the war, including the death of at least 300 people after a theater was bombed and a strike against a maternity hospital.

The mayor of the city estimated this week that more than 10,000 civilians have died in Mariupol since the siege began and that corpses have “carpeted the streets,” according to The Associated Press.

Hundreds of thousands of people have fled the city, which Russian troops encircled, depriving the remaining residents of water, food and electricity. Fighting continues to break out in the streets.

President Biden has called Russia actions in Ukraine a “genocide.” The U.S. has called for investigations of war crimes committed by Russian forces under the leadership of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Despite the brutal attacks, the territory of Mariupol is still under Ukrainian control. Kyrylenko told CNN Ukrainian forces are fighting courageously against Russian troops and are still holding on to whatever is left of Mariupol.

“The Ukrainian flag flies over the city of Mariupol, whatever anyone may say,” the governor said.

Russian forces have retreated from Kyiv and are reportedly regrouping in the eastern region of the country for a more concentrated assault.

Capturing the city of Mariupol in southeastern Ukraine is likely part of Russia’s next offensive. By taking the land near Mariupol, Russia hopes to assume control of a land bridge connected to the Crimean Peninsula.

Kyrylenko told CNN he has yet to see a “full-scale offensive from all directions” in his region, but that could change in a few days.

“I have been calling on all the population in the area to evacuate as soon as possible,” he said, “because the enemy is not going to wait. They have a column of heavy armored vehicles waiting with personnel … and they will continue heavy artillery strikes on civilian populations.”",https://thehill.com/policy/international/3270546-ukrainian-governor-says-city-of-mariupol-wiped-off-the-face-of-the-earth/

More than six weeks after the Russian siege began, Ukrainian troops are continuing to fight the vastly superior Russian forces in ferocious battles amid the ruins of what once was a bustling city on the Sea of Azov coast.

WATCH: Russian forces enter Mariupol as outgunned Ukrainians prepare for renewed assault

The city’s mayor says that an estimated 120,000 people remain in the city, of Mariupol’s pre-war population of about 450,000.

The Ukrainians’ fight against all odds has scuttled Moscow’s designs, tying up significant Russian forces and delaying the start of a planned Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine’s industrial heartland, Donbas. The Kremlin hopes that an attack in the east could reverse the battlefield fortunes for Russia after a humiliating failure of its attempt to quickly storm the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv.

Mariupol has been a key objective for Russia since the start of its invasion on Feb. 24. Capturing the city would allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014 and deprive Ukraine of a major port and prized industrial assets.

The giant Azovstal steel mill and other industrial plants have been heavily damaged by the ferocious Russian bombardment that has flattened much of Mariupol, indiscriminately hitting homes, hospitals and other public buildings and killing thousands.

The victims include about 300 people killed in last month’s Russian airstrike on the Mariupol Drama Theater that was being used as a shelter and had the word “CHILDREN” printed in Russian in huge white letters on the pavement outside to ward off aerial attack.

Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko told The Associated Press that at least 21,000 people were killed in Mariupol with bodies “carpeted through the streets.” He said that the Russians deployed mobile cremation equipment to Mariupol to methodically dispose of the victims’ bodies in order to hide the evidence of the massacre and prevent international organizations from documenting “the horror the Russian army is responsible for.”

The discovery of hundreds of bodies of civilians apparently executed by Russian forces in Kyiv’s suburbs after the Russian retreat from the area has fueled global outrage and accusations from Ukrainians and the West that Russia is committing war crimes in Ukraine.

Moscow has deployed fighters from Chechnya, known for their ferocity, to wage street battles in Mariupol. Chechnya’s Moscow-backed leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, has repeatedly boasted on his messaging app channel about defeating Ukrainians in Mariupol, but the fight has continued.

Boychenko said that several Ukrainian units are still fighting the Russians in Mariupol, including the 36th Marine Brigade, the Azov Regiment, some Interior Ministry troops and border guards.

The Azov Regiment, a seasoned volunteer force that is widely considered one of the country’s most capable units, is defending the mammoth Azovstal steel plant that covers an area of nearly 11 square kilometers (over 4.2 square miles). It has taken advantage of the plant’s sprawling network of concrete buildings and underground facilities to repel continuous Russian attacks.

The 36th Marine Brigade was maintaining defensive positions at the Azovmash and Zavod Ilyicha factories until it ran out of supplies and ammunition and made a desperate attempt to break through the Russian blockade earlier this week.

In a post on the brigade’s Facebook page, one of its officers described the unit’s heroic resistance, saying that “for more than a month, the marines have been fighting without replenishing amunition, food and water supplies.” “The wounded accounted for nearly a half of the brigade’s strength, but those who still had their limbs and were capable of walking reported back to duty,” the post said.

Boychenko said that some of the marines managed to join the Azov regiment, while others were captured by the Russians. He didn’t give any numbers.

The Russian military said Thursday that a total of 1,160 Ukrainian marines surrendered this week, a claim that couldn’t be independently verified.

As the Ukrainian troops continue to offer fierce resistance in Mariupol, fears have grown that the exasperated Russians could resort to chemical weapons to deal with the remaining pockets of resistance at the Azovstal plant and other areas of the city.

Eduard Basurin, a Russia-allied separatist official in eastern Ukraine, appeared to call for that Monday, telling Russian state TV that the Russia-backed forces should block all the exits out of the factory and then “use chemical troops to smoke them out of there.” He later said that no chemical weapons were used.

The Azov Regiment claimed Monday, without providing evidence, that a drone had dropped a poisonous substance on its positions but inflicted no serious injuries. A Ukrainian defense official said the attack possibly involved phosphorus munitions.

Ukrainian authorities have said that the Russians have blocked humanitarian convoys from reaching Mariupol, keeping it without food, water and power since the siege started. The Russian troops have turned back buses sent to evacuate residents, but about 150,000 have been able to flee the city in their own vehicles.

Boychenko said that at least 33,500, and, possibly, up to 50,000 Mariupol residents have been taken to “filtration camps” in the separatist-controlled east before being forcibly sent to distant, economically depressed areas in Russia.

Mariupol has seen communications cut since the start of the siege, and as the Russians moved to capture sections of the city they launched radio broadcasts to brainwash the population.

“They unleashed propaganda, telling people that Kyiv and other cities have been captured and they have been abandoned,” Boychenko said.

The continuing fighting in Mariupol has forced the Russian military to keep a significant number of troops in the city, delaying the start of the planned new offensive in eastern Ukraine.

“As long as the street fighting is going on, Russia can’t remove troops from Mariupol and deploy them to other areas, including Donbas,” Oleh Zhdanov, an independent military expert, told the AP.

“The Ukrainian troops in Mariupol are still fulfilling their main task by diverting the Russian forces from other areas. Mariupol remains a major symbol of the Ukrainian resistance.”",https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/mariupol-holds-out-against-russias-siege-a-symbol-of-ukrainian-resistance

A total of 2,187 residents have died in days of relentless Russian bombardment, the city council said Sunday, raising the toll by almost 1,000 since Wednesday.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had earlier said he hoped a humanitarian convoy accompanied by Orthodox priests would finally make it to Mariupol.

He has accused Moscow of both blocking and attacking humanitarian convoys, although he said Sunday that another 125,000 people had been evacuated that way across Ukraine.

""The key question today is Mariupol,"" he said, saying ""we will do everything to break the resistance of the occupiers"".

Russian air strikes killed 35 people at a military base outside the western city of Lviv overnight, dangerously close to the frontier with EU and NATO member Poland, local officials said.

And in the capital Kyiv, fighting raged in the suburbs, leaving a US journalist dead -- the first foreign reporter killed since Russia's invasion of its neighbour on February 24.

Meanwhile efforts continued to get help to the strategic southern port city of Mariupol, which aid agencies say is facing a humanitarian catastrophe.

Talks between the two sides have yet to yield a ceasefire but Russia said Sunday that negotiators were making headway at talks in neighbouring Belarus.

""If we compare the positions of both delegations at the start of the talks and now, we see significant progress,"" Leonid Slutsky, a senior member of Russia's negotiating team, told state-run television network RT.

Zelensky had also said on Saturday that Russia had adopted a ""fundamentally different approach"" in the latest talks to end the conflict.

He told reporters it was in contrast to earlier talks at which Moscow only ""issued ultimatums"" and that he was ""happy to have a signal from Russia"".

Broadening target sets

For the first two weeks of the war, Russia's forces had focused on eastern and southern areas of Ukraine, but in recent days they have moved to the centre, striking the city of Dnipro.

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told ABC News that Russia was ""clearly, at least from an air strike perspective... broadening their target sets"".

Meanwhile in Kyiv, only the roads to the south remain open and the city is preparing to mount a ""relentless defence"", according to the Ukrainian presidency.

Award-winning American journalist Brent Renaud was killed by Russian forces in Irpin, Ukraine, according to Kyiv region police in social media posts on Sunday. Kyiv police said another American journalist was wounded by Russian troops.

In a tweet, Kyiv region police named the 50-year-old American journalist who was killed as Brent Renaud. Police posted a photo of his body and his American passport as evidence, as well as a photo of an outdated New York Times press badge with Brent Renaud's name.

An adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, Anton Gerashchenko, said in a statement that Renaud “paid with his life for attempting to expose the insidiousness, cruelty and ruthlessness of the aggressor,"" according to a New York Times report.

CNN has been unable to verify which media outlet the American journalists were working for in Ukraine.

The New York Times said in a statement on Sunday, ""We are deeply saddened to hear of Brent Renaud’s death. Brent was a talented filmmaker who had contributed to The New York Times over the years. Though he had contributed to The Times in the past (most recently in 2015), he was not on assignment for any desk at The Times in Ukraine. Early reports that he worked for Times circulated because he was wearing a Times press badge that had been issued for an assignment many years ago.""

Some more context: The northern Ukrainian city of Irpin, just outside Kyiv, has been the site of substantial Russian shelling in recent days and has seen extensive destruction, according to the Kyiv regional government on Friday.

Brent Renaud was a Peabody Award-winning documentary filmmaker, producer, and journalist, who lived and worked in New York City and Little Rock, Arkansas, according to his biography on the Renaud Brothers website.

With his brother Craig, Renaud spent years ""telling humanistic verite stories from the World's hot spots,"" including projects in Iraq, Afghanistan, Haiti, Egypt, and Libya, according to his website bio. Brent Renaud was a 2019 Harvard Nieman Fellow.

Christof Putzel, a friend and colleague of Renaud, told CNN his passing is a ""devastating loss to journalism today.""

""I woke up this morning to the news that Brent, long-time best friend, incredible colleague, the best war journalist I think ever existed, finding out about his passing. Brent had this ability to go anywhere, get any story, listen and communicate what was happening to people that others wouldn't otherwise see it. And it is a devastating loss to journalism today,"" Putzel told Brian Stelter on CNN's Reliable Sources Sunday.

Putzel said Renaud was working on a documentary about refugees around the world when the crisis in Ukraine hit. He said that ""Brent was on the plane the next day"" and covered the plight of refugees from Kyiv into Poland. A post on the Renaud Brothers' Facebook page, dated March 8, urged readers to follow their coverage of the war Ukraine.

Several years ago, Putzel and Renaud won a duPont Award for a story they worked on about guns being smuggled into Mexico from the US. ""What I said when we accepted our award was, the only thing bigger than Brent's balls are his heart. And I stand by that. That's what kind of journalist he was,"" Putzel said.

He said Renaud had a unique ability to make people trust him as he told their stories in places like Iraq and other war zones. ""You could sit down and spend a week watching all of Brent's stories over the years back-to-back and just be flabbergasted. The career that he had, his ability to reach people, his ability to capture the humanity behind people's suffering is something I have never seen before, and I was just honored to work with him as long as I did,"" Putzel said.

The director of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard said on Sunday that the foundation is ""heartsick"" over the death of American journalist Brent Renaud in Ukraine.

""Our Nieman Fellow Brent Renaud was gifted and kind, and his work was infused with humanity. He was killed today outside Kiev, and the world and journalism are lesser for it. We are heartsick,"" said foundation curator Ann Marie Lipinski in a tweet.

The Committee to Protect Journalists on Sunday condemned the killing of Renaud and called for the killers to be brought to justice.

The New York-based organization said in a statement, ""U.S. reporter Brent Renaud was shot and killed, and another journalist was injured on Sunday in the city of Irpin, outside of Kyiv, according to a Ukrainian police official and news reports. In denouncing the shooting, the Committee to Protect Journalists called for the killers to be brought to justice.""

“We are shocked and saddened to learn of the death of U.S. journalist Brent Renaud in Ukraine. This kind of attack is totally unacceptable, and is a violation of international law,” added the CPJ’s program director Carlos Martinez de la Serna in the statement. “Russian forces in Ukraine must stop all violence against journalists and other civilians at once, and whoever killed Renaud should be held to account.”",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-13-22/h_ea59635fb47e77ce4dc38888bf322879

The World Health Organisation (WHO), UNICEF and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) have issued a statement condemning attacks on health care Ukraine.

“These horrific attacks are killing and causing serious injuries to patients and health workers, destroying vital health infrastructure and forcing thousands to forgo accessing health services despite catastrophic needs.

“To attack the most vulnerable – babies, children, pregnant women, and those already suffering from illness and disease, and health workers risking their own lives to save lives – is an act of unconscionable cruelty,” the statement said.

UNFPA is the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency.

“In Ukraine, since the start of the war, 31 attacks on health care have been documented via the WHO’s Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care (SSA). According to these reports, in 24 incidents health care facilities were damaged or destroyed, while in five cases ambulances were damaged or destroyed. These attacks have led to at least 12 deaths and 34 injuries, and affected access to and availability of essential health services. WHO is verifying further reports, as attacks continue to be reported despite the calls for protection of health care.

“Attacks on health care and health workers directly impact people’s ability to access essential health services – especially women, children and other vulnerable groups. We have already seen that the health care needs of pregnant women, new mothers, younger children and older people inside Ukraine are rising, while access to services is being severely limited by the violence.

“For example, more than 4,300 births have occurred in Ukraine since the start of war and 80,000 Ukrainian women are expected to give birth in next three months. Oxygen and medical supplies, including for the management of pregnancy complications, are running dangerously low.

“The health care system in Ukraine is clearly under significant strain, and its collapse would be a catastrophe. Every effort must be made to prevent this from happening.

“International humanitarian and human rights law must be upheld, and the protection of civilians must be our top priority.

“Finally, we call for an immediate ceasefire, which includes unhindered access so that people in need can access humanitarian assistance. A peaceful resolution to end the war in Ukraine is possible.”

While speaking to CNN, officials in the besieged city said, it has suffered 22 bombing attacks in the last 24 hours, resulting in the killing of as many as 2,187 civilians. ""To date, 2,187 Mariupol residents have died from attacks by Russia,"" the city council of Mariupol said on Sunday. ""The situation in Mariupol continues to be very difficult. The city has no electricity, water, heat, almost no mobile communication, is running out of food and water,"" CNN quoted officials as saying.

Meanwhile, the international humanitarian movement agency, Red Cross, has warned of a worst-case scenario for hundreds of thousands of civilians in the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol unless the parties agree to ensure their safety and access to humanitarian aid. In a statement released on Sunday, the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer, said that residents of Mariupol have endured a weeks-long life-and-death nightmare.

""Life-changing injuries and chronic, debilitating conditions cannot be treated. The human suffering is simply immense,"" it added.

Over 4,00,000 Residents of Mariupol facing food and water crises, says city Mayor

Earlier on Friday, Mariupol city mayor, Vadym Boychenko, said that the area has been cut off from all basic necessities and added the residents were now left out without food and water. In a televised address, he narrated the horrific situation of the city wherein he said that the area of more than 4,00,000 residents has now been left out without electricity, water, food, medicine and other basic necessities. He appealed to the European Union, the West and international communities for military assistance in order to create a humanitarian corridor for the safe evacuation of more than four lakh residents. Boychenko said that the Russian shellings were now targetting hospitals and added that he did not see any signs of stabilisation in the near future.

""The city lost heating, water, and electricity after five days of non-stop missile attacks by Russian troops. People are running out of food and medicine. About 300 wounded are in hospitals, which are also under attack. We don’t see any signs of stabilisation in the city,"" Kyiv Independent quoted Mayor Vadym Boychenko as saying. Earlier today, Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that nearly 1,25,000 civilians have been evacuated through safe-passage corridors so far, and a convoy with humanitarian aid is headed to Mariupol. ""The main task today is Mariupol. Our convoy with humanitarian aid is two hours away from Mariupol. Only 80km (left),"" he added in a televised address on Sunday.

The City Council said Russian invaders are cynically and purposefully hitting residential houses, crowded places, damaging children's hospitals and completely destroying the city's infrastructure.

""Every bombing brings terrible destruction and takes away the main thing - the life of a peaceful Mariupol. To date, 2,187 Mariupol residents have died from Russian attacks. May the memory of them live forever,"" the statement said.

""Today, Russian fascists continued to bomb the city from planes. The residential sector at the intersection of Nakhimova Avenue and Italiiska Street was shelled, and strikes were also carried out in the area of the Savona cinema. In addition, there are reports of the shelling of the Mariupol State University building,"" the statement reads.

The greatest threat to 400,000 Mariupol residents, who are currently blocked in the city, comes from the sky. ""Therefore, NATO's closure of the sky over Ukraine or the provision of the necessary air defense systems is a solution that could save hundreds of thousands of innocent lives across Ukraine,"" the City Council said.

Earlier reports said that Russian forces had caused the worst humanitarian catastrophe in Mariupol. Unable to defeat the Ukrainian army, the invaders are bombing civilians and blockingthe arrival of humanitarian aid.

Katasztrofális állapotba került az egészségügy a gazdasági válság sújtotta Srí Lankán – írja a CNN.

A válság miatt hiány alakult ki számtalan termékből, és az áramellátás is akadozik. Ezt szenvedi meg az egyik kórházban ápolt hároméves Miru is, akinek rosszindulatú agydaganata van, amely miatt gyakran epilepsziás rohamot kap, ilyenkor pedig percekre eszméletét veszti. Egy görcsoldó gyógyszer enyhít a fájdalmain, aminek a behozatala jelentősen megnehezedett most.

""A kórházban már nem kapható. A közeli gyógyszertárakból is elfogyott a készlet"" – mondta a kisfiú apja a CNN-nek. Egy másik édesapa is gyógyszertárról gyógyszertárra jár Srí Lanka legnagyobb városában, Colombóban, hogy kemoterápiás gyógyszert, Topotekánt szerezzen be a 7 éves lányának. ""Egyetlen állami kórházban, gyógyszertárban vagy importőrnél sincs. Sehol sincs Sri Lankán. Mit tegyek? Lehet, hogy a gyermekem nem él sokáig, ha nem kapja meg a gyógyszert"" – fogalmazott.

Az orvosok eközben arról számolnak be, hogy máskor egyszer használatos orvosi eszközöket mosnak el és használnak újra. Volt, hogy a mobiltelefon vakujával világítottak, miközben áramszünet lett egy kisgyermek szívműtétje közben. A Srí Lanka-i Orvosi Szövetség szerint több állami kórházat arra utasítottak, hogy függesszék fel a rutinműtéteket és csökkentsék a laboratóriumi vizsgálatok számát az érzéstelenítőszerek és a vizsgálatokhoz használt összetevők korlátozott készletei miatt.

Az orvosi felszerelésekből is hiány van. A Srí Lanka-i Perinatális Társaság elnöke például arra utasította a kórházakat, hogy sterilizálják és használják újra az újszülöttek tüdejének oxigénellátására használt intubálócsöveket.

Egy intenzív osztályon dolgozó sebész a CNN-nek arról beszélt, hogy a sztrók és a szívroham kezelésére használt létfontosságú gyógyszerekből kritikusan kevés van, és a kórháza kénytelen újrafelhasználni a katétereket is. ""Tudom, hogy ezzel veszélyeztetem a következő beteg életét. Reménytelennek és teljesen tehetetlennek érzem magam. Ez ellentétes mindennel, amire megtanítottak minket"" – mondta.

Egy másik orvos azt nyilatkozta: „Nehéz döntéseket kellett hoznunk, különösen az intenzív osztályon, például hogy ki maradhat életben és ki nem. Lehet, hogy továbbra is felveszünk betegeket, de nem lesz módunk kezelni őket”.

Az egészségügyi dolgozók hónapok óta figyelmeztetnek a közelgő válságra, az orvosok és ápolók az utcára is vonultak, hogy tiltakozzanak a kormány tétlensége ellen. A válság jeleit már évekkel ezelőtt érezni lehetett, a koronavírus-járvány gazdasági-társadalmi hatásai, a külföldi hitelek és a kormány gazdaságpolitikája egyaránt hozzájárultak a kialakulásához. A CNN-nek az egészségügyi minisztérium egyik tisztviselője a héten azt mondta: „Én ezt inkább kihívásnak, és még nem válságnak nevezném”.

Russia warns US and Nato of ‘unpredictable consequences’ over arming Ukraine

Steve Robson

Russia has formally warned the West of “unpredictable consequences” as a result of it arming Ukraine.

A diplomatic note was sent to the White House earlier this week claiming that shipments of the “most sensitive” weapons from the US and Nato are “adding fuel” to the conflict, the Washington Post reports.

The correspondence was received on Tuesday just as President Biden confirmed a new $800 million (£612m) package of military assistance, including long-range howitzers, coastal drones and armoured vehicles, to help Ukraine match Russia’s capability.

Comment I am no fan of secret policemen, but having worked for the state for over 20 years, if one counts Chile, then I can not claim to be pure. I have been too close to power to claim innocence. I just loathe British hypocrisy when it looks like pushing World war III beyond the Pale – an old Irishism for the uninitiated.

Britain and the U.S are in charge of this conflagration. Whatever former secret police boss Putin’s past sins may be, Biden and Johnson are not pure.. This started out on a very simple issue, but NATO’s greedy war mongers would not back down.

Now they have roped the vainglorious Of Sweden and Finland in on the game. I spent a term at the International Graduate School in Stockholm before finances pushed me back into labouring. Sweden used to be cool. Not anymore. The Western hegemony closed in long ago.

Putin needs to forget his secret police past, work out what he wants and come out of the dark.

Russia is thought to have the largest supply of nuclear weapons in the world, with around 6,257 nuclear warheads comprising 1,458 active weapons, 3,039 available to be deployed and 1,760 retired, according to Statistica. During the first week of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, he placed the country’s nuclear weapons forces on high alert.

He said: “Western countries aren’t only taking unfriendly economic actions against our country, but leaders of major NATO countries are making aggressive statements about our country.

“So I order to move Russia’s deterrence forces to a special regime of duty.”

Comment It astonishes me as to how stupid and ignorant the western masses appear to be. Russia is an enigma, with a questionable Yelstsin and post oligarch denouement. But this is not a good moralising platform given how state assets were stolen , welcome and invested in the West. The west are after something and it is obvious. They started this war.

Punishing the once welcome oligarchs with their dirty money is no way to cleanse the past. What happens to those western built super yachts is rather beside the point. Putin is no angel, but he knows that NATO and the corrupt western culture is not a way to future world stability. NATO are obviously power maniacs and agents of the Anglo Western Plutocracy. They have their own planet eating agenda. They are the fat cats. Nuclear war is an insidious possibility. R J Cook

He is a mercenary if Britain is not officially at war. He was getting his upkeep, so he was paid. Logically a free flow of so called volunteers from the U.K , either constitues an act of war or mercenaries.

But it is likely he will be used for propaganda purposes or as a political pawn by Vladimir Putin’s regime. He could eventually be released as part of a prisoner exchange.

Speaking to a friend in the UK just before he and his unit were captured, he said: ‘It’s been 48 days. We tried our best to defend Mariupol but we have no choice but to surrender to Russian forces.

‘We have no food and no ammunition. It’s been a pleasure everyone, I hope this war ends soon.’

Earlier this week, Mr Aslin’s younger brother Nathan Wood begged Russian authorities to take good care of him.

He told MailOnline: ‘As a family we don’t want to say too much because Aiden’s well-being and safety is our prime concern but President Putin has made dire warnings to those Westerners caught fighting for the Ukrainian Army.

‘Aiden has been called a mercenary but that isn’t true, he enrolled with the Ukrainian Army four years ago and has dual citizenship.

Russia warns Finland and Sweden against considering Nato membership

on Monday warned Finland and Sweden against joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) amid reports of Nordic countries rushing to become a part of the military alliance in the wake of the war in Ukraine.

Calling the alliance a “tool of confrontation”, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Nato’s further expansion would “not bring stability to the European continent”.

Mr Peskov’s remarks came a day after it was reported that US officials are expecting Finland to apply for a membership as early as June, which would be followed by Sweden.

Pro-Russia cavalcade provokes shock and anger in Ireland

Rory Carroll Ireland correspondent

A pro-Russian cavalcade in Dublin led by a car with the Z symbol has provoked astonishment and condemnation in Ireland.

https://mate.substack.com/p/urging-regime-change-in-russia-biden?s=r

About 10 cars with Russian and Irish flags drove in a convoy down the M50 motorway last Sunday afternoon in an apparent display of support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The bonnet of the lead vehicle, a green Jeep, bore the Z symbol that Russian forces use in Ukraine.

The rally is believed to have been organised through a private Facebook group for Russians living in Ireland. Pro-Russia rallies were held in Germany on the same day, including a motorcade rally in Hanover.

Comment It concerns me that all of us in Britain & Ireland are supposed to mindlessly support corrupt Ukraine and NATO Imperialism. We are supposed to accept being dragged further down into the morass of a war set up by Anglo U.S elites. The Russians have a point of view. As for the oligarchs, they were welcomed with their dirty money. The U.K , U.S and EU want to go back to the corrupt Yeltsin days that brought them in the first.

Ukraine War! What Is It Good For? Propaganda

Iain Davis

Russia’s “special military operation” in Ukraine has been presented to us, in the West, as unprovoked and unjustified.

We have not been told about Russia’s legitimate security concerns in the face of NATO expansionism. Nor has Ukraine’s significant Nazi problem been honestly reported, with some Western propagandist even promoting them.

The Russian government claims that its recognition and defence of the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics (DPR and LPR) are born from “compassion” for the people who have been under siege for eight years. However, Russia also needs the new republics as satellite states, providing a foothold for its own national security as it opposes NATO’s advance.

Austrian leader to meet Putin in Moscow, hoping to build bridges

By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi

ZURICH (Reuters) – Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Monday, he said, adding he hoped to help build bridges between Russia and Ukraine and stop the “war of aggression”.

Nehammer’s meeting would be the first face-to-face encounter between Putin and a European Union leader since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, triggering a broad Western effort to isolate Moscow.

“I’m going to meet Vladimir #Putin in Moscow tomorrow,” Nehammer wrote on Twitter on Sunday.

“We are militarily neutral, but (have) a clear position on the Russian war of aggression against #Ukraine,” he wrote, referring to Austria’s position. “It must stop! It needs humanitarian corridors, ceasefire & full investigation of war crimes.”

Prosecution of Russian war crimes is ultimate test for Ukraine’s state

Isobel Koshiw in Borodianka

Surrounded by a scrum of reporters with a backdrop of bombed-out apartment buildings and rubble in Borodianka, a town in the Kyiv region, stood Iryna Venediktova, Ukraine’s prosecutor general.

Venediktova is carrying the weight of bringing almost 2,000 cases of war crimes committed by Russia’s occupying forces to court at home and abroad. Her office is the only body in Ukraine with the power to investigate. It is through her office that information relating to war crimes is being collected, investigations will be conducted and domestic and international cases will be built.

Reminiscent of Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s trip to newly liberated territories outside Kyiv, Venediktova walked around Borodianka with her subordinates observing the damage, wearing an army flak jacket and baseball cap.

The Washington-based lender in its “War in the Region” economic update on Sunday said Russia’s GDP output for 2022 will fall 11.2 per cent owing to the plethora of sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies.

By Associated Press Reporters

Ukraine’s president warned his nation on Sunday night that the coming week would be as crucial as any in the war.

“Russian troops will move to even larger operations in the east of our state,” Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly address.

He accused Russia of trying to evade responsibility for war crimes.

“When people lack the courage to admit their mistakes, apologise, adapt to reality and learn, they turn into monsters. And when the world ignores it, the monsters decide that it is the world that has to adapt to them. Ukraine will stop all this,” Mr Zelensky said.

The bombing of a train station in Ukraine where many were gathered to evacuate. The murder of countless civilians in Bucha and other areas. As evidence of Russian atrocities against Ukraine builds, so do calls to bring the perpetrators to justice — including from US President Joe Biden, who recently said Vladimir Putin should be tried for war crimes.

Thirdly, why was it OK to fake rape charges against war crime whistle blower Julian Assange then lock him away facing extradition and slow death – just because he was whistle blower for Anglo-U.S War crimes ? Answer is, because this is not really about war crimes. It was a war provoked by NATO , for regime change on the way to do the same with China.

As Ukrainian civilians are tortured by Russian soldiers in their own villages, European Union countries such as Germany have continued to import $850 million (£647 million) of Russian oil and gas every day, financially propping up the invading nation. Ukrainian diplomat Vasyl Filipchuk accused those still relying on Russian fuel of “hypocrisy” and called for countries to recognise the blood on their own hands.

Russia’s stretched military is reportedly sending soldiers to fight in Ukraine with weapons developed in the late 19th century.

Conscripts in the Russian-backed Donbas region are said to have been dispatched into front-line fighting with a rifle called a Mosin, with the Kremlin relying on weapons stocks dating to the Second World War.

Vladimir Putin’s forces have struggled against fierce Ukrainian resistance and a steady supply of modern weaponry from Western allies.

After nearly six weeks of war, Moscow has claimed only limited territorial gains and while notching up significant losses in terms of vehicles, weapons and troops.

Nato estimates that up to 15,000 Russian soldiers may have been killed in the fighting, while Kyiv claims the death toll could have exceeded 18,000.

Western elites have shale gas for sale .Russia is competition and the environment does not matter. Greens are ‘green.’ How does one get to the truth? I live in a very corrupt country. The Soviet Union , like the rest of the world’s governments now, was corrupt. The west created Stalin and Hitler to destroy Lenin’s dream. The West plotted the ultimate war crime, backed by Churchill, to Nuke the Soviet Union.

Where is the moral high ground here ? The West encouraged the very Thatcherite oligarchs to steal state assets, bringing their ill gotten gains to the U.K and the west. How can anyone believe that we have an independent media ? Julian Assange’s continued incarceration informs us as to what the west really thinks about war crimes. Miss Roberta Jane Cook

Russian people fought to break the mould of European Capitalist Germanic Monarchical corrupt Romanov oppression. After the world war fun elitist inbred in fighting mass slaughter, the western elite made sure Lenin died, replaced by Georgian lunatic and paranoid cretin Stalin. After Russia did the most to defeat Nazism, the west plotted to Nuke them.

The dream of real quality ended. The Western elite have gone on to lie, corrupt and fool the masses.

I have worked with Russians. They are good people, so are the Poles, But there is so much internecine hatred in Eastern Europe. I see no happiness. I see no improvement to world wide political corruption. I see no hope for humanity. The most awful people seek and take power.

Western media clubs together to white-wash Ukrainian Neo-Nazis

Multiple outlets use the same talking points, quotes, and ‘experts’ to whitewash Ukraine’s notorious “Azov” regiment

During the last week of March, multiple major media outlets in the UK and the US ran stories about Ukraine’s ‘Azov Batalion’, seeking to whitewash almost a decade of previous reporting that clearly identified the unit’s Nazi sympathies and ethos. Supposedly acting independently, they nonetheless stuck to the same talking points and often the same verbiage, suggesting a concerted effort to spin the unit as heroic defenders of Ukraine against the alleged “real” fascists – the Russians.

The latest wave of the lionization of Azov began sometime before the Russian military operation – notorious was the much-publicized image of an AK-47-wielding Ukrainian granny training to repel invaders in the regiment’s camp. The last week of March, however, saw the puff pieces come in a tight group, like the bullet holes after an AK burst.Read more Ukrainian grandma with AK-47 shown off to Western press by neo-Nazi fighters – reports

Russian Away.

Russia cannot win a war against Ukraine because Putin is fighting resource rich NATO who do not care about freezing and starving their masses. Similarly , Zelensky cannot make decisions about peace because he was put in post by the Western elites.

I have enough reasons of my own to be terrified, but the Ukraine boss needs to be careful and do as he is told, even though what is happening in the rubble all around him is heart-breaking. people laughed when he assumed power. There is nothing to laugh about now. There is no happy ending any time soon.

So many lives have already been lost. In the words of Joan Baez protesting against the Vietnam War, “How many dead men will it take to build a dyke that will not break.”

It is quite simple, if you put the dead and valuable infrastructure destroyed to one side, the balance of power concept was drummed in to me when I started my Aylesbury College A Level History course in 1968. Years later , after long travels, I ended up back at this place in the 80s, teaching the same course.

Ukraine news fatigue is setting in, just as Putin hoped it would

Ian Dunt –

You can feel it happening now. People are starting to lose interest. Ukraine slips off the main headlines every so often – for the Chancellor’s Spring Statement, or the Partygate fines. It’ll slip off again soon, then more regularly. And eventually, a few months from now, it’ll be a news-in-brief, a few quick paragraphs detailing the who-where-when of Russia’s latest atrocity, with a body count tacked on the end.

We’re a month in, and journalists are already starting to report that Ukrainian stories are getting less views, that they’re starting to lose reader interest. People are beginning to switch off.

You can see it in how the story is covered, as well as the priority it’s given. Our standard tribal enmities are slowly seeping back into the debate. That brief moment of shared moral outrage is fading away.

“It’s not thuggish Vladimir Putin who is losing his marbles but doddery Joe Biden,” a recent Daily Mail comment headline read. Biden’s great crime was to say: “For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power.”

Macron reacts to Biden’s Putin ‘butcher’ comments

The French president made it clear that he himself “wouldn’t use such words”

The escalation of the conflict in Ukraine through words or actions should be avoided, French leader Emmanuel Macron has warned, after US President Joe Biden labeled his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, “a butcher,” who “cannot remain in power.”

When asked to comment on the statements made by Biden on the final day of his visit to Poland on Saturday, Macron said that, personally speaking, he “wouldn’t use such words.”

The French leader told the broadcaster France 3 that he was planning to talk to Putin about the situation in Ukraine in the next two days. He said his goal was “achieving first a ceasefire and then the total withdrawal of [Russian] troops by diplomatic means.”

“If we want to do that, we can’t escalate, either in words or actions,” Macron stressed.

Biden had earlier called Putin a “butcher” after visiting a stadium in Warsaw hosting Ukrainian refugees. In his speech later on that day, the US president proclaimed, “For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power.”

Comment We at RCONB seriously miss RT’s truly independent journalism. I am aware that they are hostile to politicisation of transsexualism, but at least I know that is due to fears of undermining traditional role models – not rubbish about trans folk raping Britain’s amazingly sex women ( sic ) in dirty public toilets – assuming they can find any !.. Most have been sold off to become expensive houses or colleges.

Sadly traditional roles have gone in the U.K and U.S , with the EU not looking too good either. Victimising transsexuals without considering the poisonous effect of bigoted TERF feminisms an Islam, is not going to resolve anything. Islam does at least have some idea that traditions are important, but their religion is not compatible with environmental balance, but neither is global capitalism.

In my view, whatever Vladimir Putin’s shortcomings, he is not a butcher who wants to blow up the world. Nor does the EU. The madmen and women, like Truss, are posturing war mongers with no concept of what is happening. It is black and white, good and evil. It also makes a lot of money.

Watching U.K Sky News and BBC, it was smug self righteousness. Ideas of balance of power are long gone. Russia and China are still seen as communist. That threatens the global elite privileges and luxury. So Zelensky talking of accepting NATO neutrality does not please western privileged media. Ultimately he is not in chargge which is why recent negotiators all fell ill. The U.S & U.K had much to gain from this.

Sky were saying this is a humiliating defeat to Russia because they won’t get the Donbas and should lose Crimea. They are goading Putin. They want him out and crass European elite greed culture rolling in and all the way up to China.

For the sake of balance and China’s silk Road, we must hope for Russia and Ukraine to resolve differences, end the killing and stop adulating the EU along with the U.K and U.S beyond. The U.K , U.S A have a police state mentality. Russia wants a balance of power. NATO wants dominance.

These countries elites do very little good for their people and are fooling them into wartime fantasies of reliving the false glories of two previous vile rich man’s wars, where the poor pay for it with higher prices and tax,, where the rich got richer while the poor are comforted with religious delusion, so many paying with their lives.

The world needs many regime changes, but western elites would be hard to to topple. Then there are the African and Middle Eastern tyrants so loved by the likes of Britain with rubbish about a Commonwealth. Russia is a beacon of hope, not perfect, but not a nation of hypocrites. R J Cook

Russia switches tactics to grind down Ukraine’s army in the east

By Nebi Qena and Yuras Karmanau, Associated Press

With its aspirations for a quick victory dashed by a stiff Ukrainian resistance, Russia has increasingly focused on grinding down Ukraine’s military in the east in the hope of forcing Kyiv into surrendering part of the country’s territory to possibly end the war.

The bulk of the Ukrainian army is concentrated in eastern Ukraine, where it has been locked up in fighting with Moscow-backed separatists in a nearly eight-year conflict. If Russia succeeds in encircling and destroying the Ukrainian forces in the country’s industrial heartland called Donbas, it could try to dictate its terms to Kyiv and, possibly, attempt to split the country in two.

The Russian military declared on Friday that the “first stage of the operation” had been largely accomplished, allowing Russian troops to concentrate on their “top goal — the liberation of Donbas”.

Voices: Zelensky shouldn’t trust Putin – or quit while he’s ahead

Sean O’Grady

General Kyrylo Budanov is someone worth listening to. The head of Ukraine’s Defence Intelligence Service has the great distinction of not only predicting with confidence the Russian invasion weeks before it happened, but he also knows more about what is going on in this war than Vladimir Putin does. This is for the simple reason that the Russian junior commanders fear to tell their bosses the truth, and the colonels dare not tell Putin the truth.

Read More Voices: Zelensky shouldn’t trust Putin – or quit while he’s ahead (msn.com)

Comment This is a report by the not so Independent internet news. It is owned by a friendly oligarch with a grudge against Vladimir Putin. It represents the alleged British anti Putin consensus.

The British Government and Parliament is dominated by comfortable opinionated females and posturing men keen to display their masculinity. Like the male transphobes, they suffer from M.I.S.S -Masculinity Insecure Sex Syndrome. They , like the U.K and U.S media want Anglo U.S troops in Ukraine to fight the evil Putin, then march on to infest Russia with their institutional corruption, greed and lies. They want the World and think they can win, which is why NATO set this up

Biden is showing restraint, but Britain still has delusions of Imperial grandeur. It’s pampered elite are sending what Truss calls ‘lethal exports.’ Britain is well and truly in this war and MPs want a no fly zone.. They want to prolong it and remove Putin.

Zelensky has become more reasonable with Russia but we here at RCONB do not believe Zelensky is free to decide.. Britain and NATO do not want Ukraine to be neutral and the EU wants its resources. R J Cook

Judge Not Lest Ye Be Judged – Roberta Jane Cook

Comment This above headline is a perfect example of how there is only one correct opinion in so called British democracy, where atrocities like Operation ‘Shock & Awe ” in the illegal Anglo U.S War on Iraq and in Donbas go unnoticed by Western Media Elites and War Crimes experts.

The same goes for the alleged shooting of Russian POWs, where western media instantly discounts videos as Russian lies. Only the demonised Russians lie it seems.

As for the British media idiot comparing dividing Ukraine to dividing London to Ukraine, what a cretin. As for dividing off Ukraine from Russia, so badly in the first place, thank western lackey Boris Yeltsin for that. As for the current war, thank power and money grabbing NATO for offering Ukraine’s elite EU & NATO membership after overthrowing the elected government in favour of oligarch Poroshenko in 2014, triggering Ukraine’s Donbas genocide and the nightmare we have today.

Never mind, the people traffickers have never had it so good with so many young women forced to flee the country, as they did in 2014 . I have written elsewhere about how I met one of those poor girls who was working as a stripper and prostitute in a club next door to Limassol Police Station, Cyprus 2014.

This is a rotten world, run for and governed by the rich in the west, a system they cannot wait to extend via the weapons loving NATO. We are supposed to judge the wonders of our ‘free’ democracies by how badly the elite represent China and the east. I judge them by their hypocrisy and what they have done to Julian Assange.

Ukraine to investigate after video shows alleged Russian POWs being shot: Zelensky aide

by Victor I. Nava, Overnight News Editor

Peace Hope“

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky has said his government would consider declaring neutrality and offering security guarantees to Russia, including keeping Ukraine nuclear-free.

Both Ukraine and Russia are set to hold fresh peace talks in Turkey this week.

He told independent Russian journalists on Sunday that the issue of neutrality – and agreeing to stay out of Nato – should be put to Ukrainian voters in a referendum after Russian troops withdraw.

Russia just sent a chilling reminder to the world of its nuclear arsenal

Sinead Butler

Speaking on Saturday (March 26), Medvedev detailed the four different scenarios in Russia’s nuclear doctrine, The Guardian reported.Viewers Had To Look Away When This Happened On Live TVAdAdLife Indigo

“We have a special document on nuclear deterrence. This document clearly indicates the grounds on which the Russian Federation is entitled to use nuclear weapons. There are a few of them, let me remind them to you: number one is the situation, when Russia is struck by a nuclear missile. The second case is any use of other nuclear weapons against Russia or its allies.

“The third is an attack on a critical infrastructure that will have paralysed our nuclear deterrent forces. And the fourth case is when an act of aggression is committed against Russia and its allies, which jeopardised the existence of the country itself, even without the use of nuclear weapons, that is, with the use of conventional weapons.”

Additionally, Medvedev warned how there is a “determination to defend the independence, sovereignty of our country, not to give anyone a reason to doubt even the slightest that we are ready to give a worthy response to any infringement on our country, on its independence”.Continue reading

‘They will see our faces’: Ukrainians in embattled cities insist Vladimir Putin can never take their country

Ukrainians in embattled cities insist Vladimir Putin can never take their country and insist they will continue to step forward to resist his troops.

When we were leaving, everything was destroyed

Mariupol, by Haley Bader

Alla spent three weeks sheltering in a basement in the smashed city of Mariupol as Russian shells rained down. The 87-year-old slept on a wooden board, with no light or clean water. Instead, the basement’s desperate occupants bled the building’s central heating system.

“It was brown, this water. They filled up anything they had.” Her grandson, Misha, had called her at five in the morning after the bombing started on February 24 and told her to get ready to leave. Alla did not imagine what was in store, did not even pack underwear. “How little you have,” her grandson said when he saw her.

Joe Biden’s gaffe in Warsaw is a gift to the Kremlin and has raised Western fears about his leadership

Victoria-craw

Just for once it seemed everything was going Joe Biden’s way. His European trip was wrapping up, and had secured gripping images countering the narrative that his presidency was lost at sea.

But nine ad-libbed words in Warsaw then raised fresh questions about Biden’s capacity to lead the West in its standoff against Vladimir Putin.

“For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power” is, of course, a statement of fact. But regime change in Moscow is not US policy. For weeks, the President and his top advisers have twisted themselves into pretzels to avoid indicating whether they think it’s “game over” for the Kremlin dictator.

Putin hits back at attempts to ‘cancel’ Russia

The moves to “erase” Russian culture in response to Ukraine conflict are akin to Nazi book burnings, the president said

Russian President Vladimir Putin has compared efforts by the elites in the West to weaponize “cancel culture” against famous Russian composers and writers – in response to the country’s military offensive in Ukraine – to Nazi book burnings.

“Today, they are trying to cancel the whole of our thousand-year-old country, our people,” Putin said on Friday at a virtual meeting with recipients of presidential awards for achievements in fine arts and literature. The president blasted what he called “growing discrimination of everything connected to Russia” in some Western countries. He added that the process was “tolerated and sometimes encouraged by the ruling elites.”

Rubles-for-gas plan breaches contract – EU

The currency companies must pay for Russian fossil fuels is fixed in their contracts, the bloc’s leaders claim

Leaders from some European Union member states have claimed that Moscow’s demand that “unfriendly” countries pay rubles for Russia’s gas could breach supply contracts, Reuters reported on Thursday.

On Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered that gas contracts with “unfriendly countries” – those responsible for sanctions against Russia – be settled in rubles only. The announcement sent European gas prices soaring, raising concerns of a possible energy crunch in the EU.

NATO slammed as former US Army chief exposes ‘two big issues’ in united Russia response

Ebun Hargrave

US Army vice chief of staff general Jack Keane, sat down on LBC radio to talk about the NATO conference which took place earlier this week. Mr Keane discussed the possibility that Putin could deploy chemical biological weapons on the battlefield. Russian President Vladimir Putin has already used the highly condemned thermobaric weapons since the war started just over a month ago.

The US Army chief acknowledged there had been no public policy declaration on the consequences Putin would face if he was to take such a barbaric action.

Mr Keane said: “Listen I was very disappointed by the NATO summit.

“I totally applaud the fact that they’re going to increase by 40k troops in Eastern Europe.

“And they’re increasing sanctions and it seems like a sense of unity.

“But on two big issues, it’s got to be disappointing, there’s no NATO public policy declaration.

Biden calls on Russian people to stand against Putin to stop the war

by Katherine Doyle, White House Reporter |

WARSAW — President Joe Biden made an impassioned appeal to the people of Russia to stand up to President Vladimir Putin to stop his military assault on Ukraine.

Biden implored the people of Russia to reject Putin’s bloody invasion into neighboring Ukraine, an act that has been met with some resistance from both Russian civilians and troops.

Read More Biden calls on Russian people to stand against Putin to stop the war | Washington Examiner

Comment One assumes that Putin realises this is a World War. He was too slow to act because he simply wanted to stop something that had already happened under Poroshenko. Ukraine was de facto NATO, which is why all the weapons and ordnance were in place along with trainers and expertise, along with mercenaries and western trainers, not to mention CIA and MI6.

Petro Poroshenko, former Ukraine President and Oligarch. Corrupt Ukraine is a perfect fit for EU and NATO.

The United States has much to commend it, but some terrible institutional and infrastructure issues. Its immigration policy is worse than chaotic. It is a random free for all. The United States has plundered Latin America for a very long time, all for resources. They do deals with the drug barons. Their policies aren’t that different from the ones they have in Europe and the Middle East. It doesn’t matter how hideous the killing. Who remembers Oliver North and the Contras ?

So imagine Putin telling Americans to rise up against their war mongering war criminal government. Who remembers the Bay of Pigs, Vietnam and Cambodia. Who remembers the British in Malaya.

Having said all of that, I don’t understand why Putin did not attack sooner and go straight to annexing the Donbas. R J Cook

Russia running out of precision munitions in Ukraine war and will use more dumb bombs, says Pentagon official

Ruchira Sharma

Russia’s supply of precision guided munitions is low meaning the country is more likely to rely on so-called dumb bombs and artillery, a senior Pentagon official has said.

Under Secretary of Defence for Policy Colin Kahl shared the latest intelligence claiming that Vladimir Putin’s forces were running low on precision guided weapons and missiles and were therefore much more likely to use unguided explosives.

So-called dumb bombs, also referred to as unguided bombs, do not contain a guidance system and therefore follow a ballistic trajectory.

Russia’s ex-president explains decision to ditch dollar and euro for gas trade

Dmitry Medvedev told RT that Western sanctions left Moscow no other choice

Russia had no other choice but to switch to its national currency, the Russian ruble, in its energy trade with Western nations, due to the nature of sanctions imposed on the country, the former head of state explained to RT and Ria Novosti journalists on Thursday.

Dmitry Medvedev, who served as president from 2008-2012 and is currently the deputy chairman of the Security Council of Russia, argued that President Vladimir Putin’s decision on Wednesday to switch to rubles in its energy trade with Western buyers is perfectly logical, with Moscow having no other option under the circumstances.

“They shut down the correspondent accounts for our commercial banks, made settlements in dollars and euros impossible and disconnected the banks on the sanctions list from SWIFT, at least some of them. What did they think we were going to do?” the Russian politician inquired rhetorically.

Read More JK Rowling hits back at Vladimir Putin after he drags her into row over ‘cancelling Russian culture’ (msn.com)

Comment Vicious transphobe J K Rowling is quick to grab an opportunity to redeem herself, jumping on Vladimir Putin for his reference to Western Cancel Culture. She is , like Boris, looking for a diversion to make herself look like an angel among heroes.

It is the best bandwagon since Covid Lockdown and Masks became a new national religion. Rowling knows as much about the Russo Ukraine War as she does about transgender. Her comments on Putin and Ukraine are as hideously superficial and pseudo moralistic as her dangerous drivel about transsexuals.

Vladimir Putin is right to point out the realities of western dictatorship – which set up this proxy war using Ukraine to fire its bullets.. Rowling, as an obvious TERF feminist and feminist dictator who has done a lot of harm, has no right to lecture Putin. Putin is simply pointing out that Western Culture is far from ideal and its claim to righteous democracy is bogus.

Unfortunately , as with the United States, Russia’s constitution makes this clear.

(Reuters) -Russia told the United States on Wednesday it would throw out an unspecified number of American diplomats in response to a U.S. move to expel Russian staff from the permanent U.N. mission, Interfax news agency said.

The agency also cited the Russian foreign ministry as telling the United States that any hostile actions against Moscow would provoke a decisive response.

Last month Washington said it had expelled 12 Russian diplomats at the United Nations over national security concerns, describing them as “intelligence operatives”.

EU shame as bloc poised to import record levels of Russian energy: ‘Securing supplies!’

Callum Hoare

EU ambassadors will continue working on proposals to curb soaring energy prices ahead of a summit on Thursday. A leaked draft reportedly shows that the Commission is ready to call on EU countries to ill up their gas stores at least 90% before the next winter. The move, according to Politico, is to reduce Europe’s “dependency on Russian gas, oil and coal imports:.

But, the draft calls on these members to start refilling gas storage “as soon as possible” and preferably by working “together on the joint purchase of gas, LNG and hydrogen.

Diplomats have already reportedly raised concerns that this could lead to record imports of gas from the Kremlin, who is currently offering energy at “discount” rates.

Read More EU shame as bloc poised to import record levels of Russian energy: ‘Securing supplies!’ (msn.com)

Comment One should be forgiven for ever thinking that Britain has left the EU. Sanctions against Russia were coming. Nordstream 2 was not going to happen. Britain’s elite conned its ignorant population into thinking Brexit meant an end to Islamic immigration.

The reverse was the case, because – as blocking white Ukrainian refugees demonstrates – the elite do not want intelligent well educated white East Europeans. The Express represents the Western NATO interest. They have no moral right to talk of shame. Let Us look at the Express newspaper and its owner.

Launched and founded in December 1974 today’s Express is currently owned by Richard Desmond, it publishes the Daily Express, Sunday Express, Daily Star and Daily Star Sunday, and the magazines OK!, New!, Star, and TV Pick Magazine.

Richard Clive Desmond (born 8 December 1951) is a British publisher, and former pornographer.

According to the 2021 Sunday Times Rich List, Desmond was the 107th richest person in the United Kingdom. He is the founder of Northern & Shell, a publisher known for running The Health Lottery and for having owned a variety of pornographic titles and of celebrity magazines (including OK! and New!), Britain’s Channel 5, pornographic television network Portland,] and Express Newspapers.

In 2020, Desmond was involved in controversy after pressuring the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government Robert Jenrick to overrule the Planning Inspectorate and approve a housing development for Desmond’s company. The timing of the decision saved the company £40 million but was later overturned.

NATO should have left Ukraine alone. Russia was already aware of persistent efforts to undermine its government, in particular Vladimir Putin. It was a very simple request to maintain Ukraine’s neutrality from NATO. I am writing this while listening to incessant BBC propaganda telling the U.K that it is all Russia’s fault. There is no Nazism, so goes the BBC rhetoric. There is no truth that Russian is a banned language or that there has been genocide.

Russian regime change is a must then onto the real enemy, China. So Britain and the U.S lead the charge that Russia will attack all Europe. As with how they provoked Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, this could be a self fulfilling prophecy.

So back to Richard Desmond. It is O.K for a man whose fortune was founded on pornography to call the EU immoral for wanting to continue Russian gas imports. It is clear that the U.K and U.S are doing all they can, as one, to force Europe to take the more expensive U.S liquified gas.

It is the same old rabble and fear rousing that lured the masses into the last two wars. We will , no doubt, soon be hearing that God is on our side. I am sure Biden and Boris, with their crews, consider themselves men of destiny. the rest of us are just dross and cannon fodder. Sanctions and rising living costs won’t affect the elite , including overpaid opinionated media propagandists. Don’t forget , sanctions are two way and are already hitting us lower orders very hard. U.K and U.S led NATO are determined to prolong this war. The U.S are now talking about sanctioning China for supporting Russia and China.

They have made clear they want Vladimir Putin jailed for war crimes, their memories clean wiped of their atrocities in the Middle East and the jailing of war crime whistle blower Julian Assange. For this and so many other reasons, I believe I live in a western police that lies, deceives, divides to rule, serving only the rich elite – with lower classes paying the taxes, higher prices and losing even more of their few freedoms.. Our government have no mandate for supporting this war and wasting taxpayers money. If Putin is so evil, it begs the question how the global economy came to be.

Ukraine has accused Russia of plotting attacks from the site of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor, having ‘looted and destroyed’ a lab containing radioactive samples.

Putin’s forces seized Chernobyl at the start of his invasion and were said to have taken its hundreds of staff hostage.

The plant has to be carefully managed to avoid further nuclear disasters like the meltdown of 1986 and is said to contain state-of-the-art equipment unique across Europe.

The ransacked Central Analytical Laboratory was used to process radioactive waste from the exclusion zone around the plant.

Biden sticks with Trump tariffs despite inflation and economic headwinds

by Haisten Willis, Staff Reporter | March 22, 2022

While he sought to portray himself as the polar opposite of former President Donald Trump during the 2020 campaign, President Joe Biden has stuck with some Trump administration policies since taking office, including on the thorny issue of tariffs.

Biden notably lifted some steel and aluminum tariffs on the European Union last fall, but those measures remain in effect beyond a certain level of imports. And Biden has maintained nearly all of Trump’s tariffs on China, even in the face of high inflation and supply chain shortages.

Ofcom revokes Russia Today’s broadcast licence with immediate effect

Kieren Williams & Ashley Summerfield

Ofcom has revoked Russia Today’s broadcast licence with immediate effect amid 29 ongoing investigations into the due impartiality of its news and current affairs coverage of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The broadcasting watchdog wrote: “Following an independent regulatory process, we have today found that RT is not fit and proper to hold a licence in the UK. As a result we have revoked RT’s UK broadcasting licence.”

Read More Ofcom revokes Russia Today’s broadcast licence with immediate effect (msn.com)

Comment Ofcom said that: “We consider that given these constraints it appears impossible for RT to comply with the due impartiality rules of our Broadcasting Code in the circumstances. ‘

Having been an avid viewer of RT, the only bias I noticed was against the transgender production line. That is because as a conservative society, this phenomenon appears understandably destabilising. I say this and understand it , even as a transsexual. I am sickened by the politicising of gender, whether it be TERF feminism, LGBTQI or ‘normal’ feminism. As for the gender queer, who believe there are 120 different genders, I can see why so called western democracy disturbs thinking Russians.

The above extract from the OFCOM report is almost funny. It is definitely absurd. Mainstream media in the U.K is 100% biased in favour of Ukraine because they and the U.S engineered this war, via NATO. China is their big worry and Russia is step one to dealing with it. Energy is a big issue in this war. Biden has said we are on the verge of a new world order which must be led by the United States.

He and UK’S Churchill fantasist , fellow American, Boris Johnson have emphasised several time s that Nordstream 2 will not be allowed to come on line. That is why Europeans and U.K households face up to triple energy bills with more to come next year because energy companies must gold plated profits, and rising prices due to increased transport costs.

Here in the U.K we are told inevitable tax rises are all for the greater good. On top of that, some dotty member of the unelected House of Lords has insisted legislation be amended to accept a minimum of 10,000 ‘refugess on top of the usual 10,000 ‘asylum seekers’ per year. There is no mention of allied increased infrastructure, such as housing, jobs and health care – in spite of the misery of so many natives are experiencing.

As I write, the BBC are whining about the plight of Navalny and Mariupol ,whilst they never mention the fate of Anglo U.S war crime whistle blower Julian Assange. So it is incredible that Ofcom can offer such condemnation of RT, whilst expecting more intelligent and open minded British not to spot the hypocrisy – or how NATO provoked and are prolonging this tragedy.

China plays ‘peacemaker’ while amplifying Russian justifications for Ukraine war

by Jerry Dunleavy, Justice Department Reporter

China is attempting to present itself as a peace mediator in Russia’s war against Ukraine while amplifying Kremlin narratives attempting to justify the war and pointing the finger at the United States.

While claiming it stands for “peace” in Ukraine, the Chinese government repeatedly blamed the U.S. for violence in Ukraine in recent weeks, variously blaming Western exuberance over the collapse of the Soviet Union during the Cold War, NATO’s membership expansion over the years, and the U.S.’s provision of weaponry to Ukraine before and after Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion.

‘Like the horrific events of WWII’: Thousands of Ukrainians ‘forcibly taken’ to Russia

Thousands of people trapped in Mariupol have been “forcibly taken” to Russia, Ukrainian officials say – with the latest attack on the besieged city reportedly destroying an art school being used as a bomb shelter.

‘Life Jim, But Not As We Knew It’ – by Roberta Jane Cook.

‘Lies that life is black & White’ – Bob Dylan.

Comment A World War Two Analogy is typical of the drivel being used by NATO and tame mainstream media. If one wants to hark back to World War Two, then one must face up to reality of Western Ukraine’s fighting with the Nazis.

One also has to face up to the fact that Ukrainian forces are using residential areas, schools and hospitals as cover for their military.

Propaganda and supplying arms, along with covert forces, is going to prolong the agony, leading to great danger, possibly a nuclear war. NATO provoked this by ignoring Russia’s reasonable demands. That is because they insist on Ukraine joining NATO, hence the coup. Then it is onwards to China. They also have to bury the Zelensky’ regime’s genocide on ethnic Russians in the Donbas, over 8 years of shelling and shooting.

Zelensky is president of nothing. He is a placeman. NATO are using the nightmare they have created, to suck Norway into their Mafia. Putin and Lavrov still hope for a negotiated peace. That is not going to happen. The global economy was and still is, supposed to lead to elite hegemony and plutocracy. Things have gone too far now.

To borrow a phrase, which apparently Captain Kirk never actually used : ‘This is life Jim, but not as we used to know it.’ The world has changed. It is even less stable and open to a climate & environmental disaster beyond imagination. The mealy mouthed weasel words I am hearing from the BBC as I write, are not going to stop this. Politically correct words won’t stop this or set the clock back. The demographic tectonic plates have shifted. The Poles and West Ukrainians, like Anglo U.S dominated NATO looked the other way when ethnic Russians were being terrorised and slaughtered.

Putin panicking at prospect of revolution in Russia inspired by Ukrainian democracy, says Boris Johnson

Andrew Woodcock

Vladimir Putin is panicking about the prospect of being overthrown by a revolution in Russia inspired by the example of freedom and democracy in Ukraine, Boris Johnson has said.

The prime minister said that Putin’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine was prompted by terror at the idea of Russians following the example of their neighbours.

Read More Putin panicking at prospect of revolution in Russia inspired by Ukrainian democracy, says Boris Johnson (msn.com)

Comment Johnson is upping the stakes for all he is worth in his Churchillian fantasy land. This NATO provoked war is perfectly timed to take attention away from him breaking his own ant democratic lockdown rules.

The Anglo Americans have an interesting idea of democracy. It involves voting for parties that are agreed on all key issues, including bombing in the name of that hypocritical planet eating ideology. Vladimir Putin made his issues with NATO very clear. He tried for too long and too hard, while the West equipped and prepared for war.

War is never fair on the masses. Decisions are taken and orders given way above their ignorant terrified heads. They pay and suffer for the brutal greed of so called leaders in the west. If Britain were a democracy , we would be free to criticise and hear the other party’s side of the story. The fact that dangerous buffoons like Johnson have to keep reminding us we have a democracy informs us that the reverse is true.

As for Ukrainian democracy, what a joke. The current regime was established when a western backed coup put Poroshenko in power , followed by Zelensky . The latter promised to end war with Russia over the Donbas genocide, which the west do not want to talk about. Ukraine is not a democracy any more than the U.K or U.S.A are. People in the Donbas have been shot bombed and occupied by Ukrainian far right armies for 8 years.. There is no proof of free and fair elections in East Ukraine. Outside humanitarian agencies and medias have refused to look at or for the evidence.

It will be a bad day for those of us who want genuine world wide democracy, not of the rich , for the rich, by the rich if NATO backed Ukraine wins this war. Ukraine could not fight Russia without NATO intelligence, mercenaries and weaponry. All Russia wanted was Minsk implemented. The fact that it wasn’t tells us all we need to no about Perfidious Albion , its mealy mouthed leadership and its allies’. R J Cook

Ukraine’s military said the aircraft repair plant was struck by cruise missiles fired from the direction of the Black Sea, which it said were likely Kh-555 weapons launched from heavy strategic bombers.

The plant was not in operation at the time of the strike and there were no casualties after at least three blasts, mayor Andriy Sadovy said.

Analysis-U.S. gamble on China over Ukraine raises tensions with rival superpower

By Trevor Hunnicutt and David Brunnstrom

WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) – The Biden administration made a carefully orchestrated gamble this week, issuing a series of public and private threats to Beijing that it will face consequences if it supports Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The strategy was capped by a tense, seven-hour meeting in Rome on Monday between U.S. President Joe Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, and China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi.

But having fired loud diplomatic salvos at Beijing, Biden administration officials are still debating the next steps to take to ensure China does not help Russia evade Western sanctions or supply weapons to Moscow as casualties mount in Ukraine.

On Stage by Roberta Jane Cook.

Comment Like all empires , the United States, founded by rich Englishmen using genocide of native Indians and black slaves traded by black leaders then bred, the United States pretends to care about common people. Like its parent country, it is divided more by class than race. The BLM banner is a cloak to hide under. The reality in the U.S is dirty, as with U.K , which the EU apes’.

In a school English discussion class when I was 15, I suggested that we humans needed to remember first that we are all animals. This was in the Buckinghamshire countryside. A well fed farmer’s daughter called Diane B, snapped back ” You might be an animal Cook, but I am not.” The irony of this snooty girl’s remark was not wasted on me. She is still around and probably still thinks she is above the laws of nature.

Winslow School Pupils 1965. The teacher front row centre is renowned composer Benjamin Brittain’s brother Robert. Diane B is the tall girl in white tee shirt, fresh from P.E standing back row first left. R J Cook is the suave blonde ,smiling back row, third from left. When I suggested in a class discussion that we were all animals, farmer’s daughter snooty Diane B responded curtly, ‘You might be an animal Cook , but I am not.’

As with Boris Johnson in the U.K, Biden is playing to a gallery of morons and election fixers. Comparisons with Chamberlain and Munich misses the point. Munich was too late. It was too late when the Anglo French hypocritical leaders ( leading to the abyss and abattoir ) spitefully blamed Germany for World War One, ground the Germans down while they had fun.

The point of no return was when Hitler came to power in 1933. The U.S had their own problems and didn’t care until Japan attacked them in 1941. The same mind set , hiding behind melodramatic World War 2 Churchill clichés is alive and well. The analogies are in the wrong place. Mainstream overpaid media folk are reading from an autocue , even near the battlefield, with their ear plugs giving directions.

Outsiders in the west believe their media and can be relied upon to play the game, fantasising about victory over something they don’t understand because they are educated not to , even in the toilet paper world of the Uni degrees. They don’t even say the world University any more, because it is too long and there is no universal wisdom on offer. There is only the ‘Uni View.’ So it is no surprise the masses can’t or won’t see where this is going . China can..

Meanwhile there has been a surprise new Covid Virus outbreak in China. That’s where it started before, then hitting Russia. The West does not want anyone to know about the bio labs the Russians found in Ukraine. But the Chinese know. Everyone laughed when a comedian and second rate actor was dropped in , by the West /NATO to sustain the nightmare coup of 2008. I didn’t because I had worked with stand up comedians. I learned that modern comedy is about the right prejudices, sneering and ridiculing conservatism as a smokescreen for hypocrisy. modern comedians are ambitious, vain, conceited , smug and competitive. They like being on stage, none more so than Yelensky. R J Cook.

Is Vladimir Putin a war criminal, and who decides?

Associated Press

Joe Biden called Vladimir Putin a “war criminal” on Wednesday for the unfolding onslaught in Ukraine, where hospitals and maternity wards have been bombed.

But declaring someone a war criminal is not as simple as just saying the words. There are set definitions and processes for determining who is a war criminal and how they should be punished.

Here’s a look at how this all works:

Who is a war criminal?

The term applies to anyone who violates a set of rules adopted by world leaders known as the law of armed conflict. The rules govern how countries behave in times of war.

Cold Bloodied Imbeciles

Roberta Jane Cook

Comment The system for all its fine words, is defined, implemented and controlled by the western elite. The court has to oblige and is constructed accordingly. Therefore the answer is, war criminals with exceptional ruling status decide. That is why they locked up Chelsea Manning and Julian Assange for revealing Anglo U.S War crimes in an illegal war. Obama alos has a case to answer. The U.S rely on the CIA , MI6 and SAS for their dirty tricks.

This is not justice. Biden clique threats of prosecution , extended against China is no route to peace and a stable world order. The point for peace was breached when the war crimes by the Ukraine, since western backed coup in 2014, were ignored by this court and other sanctimonious western led bodies. The point was also breached by the Anglo U.S elite whispering in Yelensky’s ear , that Ukraine’s NATO and EU membership was as good as done.

NATO and parasitical arms traders have no interest in a buffer zone because they want to move on to Russia and China. Meanwhile, Zelensky throws up NATO flak about Russia getting ready to take the whole of Eastern and Western Europe.

The vain western leaders are reckless imbeciles leading their people like lemmings off the World War Three cliff. Russia has no way out and the world is even more dependent on China. China knows that they are next on the regime change NATO list. It is asinine to speculate what China will do if the Boris / Biden bulls-i is Stacked any higher. by their careerist cold bloodied lackeys of both genders .. R J Cook

UN International Court of Justice orders Russia to halt invasion of Ukraine

Julian Borger in Washington

The UN’s International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague has ordered Russia to halt its invasion of Ukraine, saying the court had not seen any evidence to support the Kremlin’s justification for the war, that Ukraine was committing genocide against Russian-speakers in the east of the country.

The court ruled by 13 votes to two for a provisional order that “the Russian Federation shall immediately suspend military operations that it commenced on 24 February 2022 in the territory of Ukraine”. Only the Russian and Chinese judges on the court voted against the order.

The court president, US judge Joan Donoghue, said the court “is not in possession of evidence substantiating” Russian allegations of genocide on Ukrainian territory. In any case, she said it was “doubtful” the Genocide Convention gives any authority for the “unilateral use of force in the territory of another state”.

Read More UN International Court of Justice orders Russia to halt invasion of Ukraine (msn.com)

Comment Western hypocrisy continues to astonish me. The evidence for Ukraine’s genocide on ethnic Russians in the Donbas has been overwhelming since the outset in 2008. The evidence of Anglo U.S War crimes in Iraq and Guantanamo has been so obvious since whistle blowers Manning and Assange were jailed to shut them up. One can only conclude that there is no objective moral or natural justice basis for this court to pontificate. It is representative of war mongering NATO which backed an illegal war in Iraq, covered all with lies, killed tens of thousands destabilising the Middle East and North Africa. That atrocious carnage goes on – down played or ignored by vested interest elite media.

Addressing government ministers nearly three weeks into the war in Ukraine, the Russian president said what Moscow calls its “special military operation” was going to plan and that his country was ready to discuss neutral status for Ukraine.

West’s global political and economic dominance ends – Putin

The Russian president says the “myth of the Western welfare state, of the so-called golden billion, is crumbling”

Russian President Vladimir Putin has opined that the latest rounds of unprecedented sanctions imposed on Russia by the US and its allies over the Kremlin’s military campaign in Ukraine, mark the end of an era. According to Putin, from now on the West will be losing its “global dominance” both politically and economically.

Speaking on Wednesday, the Russian head of state proclaimed that the “myth of the Western welfare state, of the so-called golden billion, is crumbling.” Moreover, it is the “whole planet that is having to pay the price for the West’s ambitions, and its attempts to retain its vanishing dominance at any cost,” Putin said.

The president predicted food shortages across the world as Western sanctions against Russia are adversely affecting the entire global economy.

Touching on the decision by several Western powers to freeze Russia’s central bank assets, Putin claimed that this would only serve to irreparably undermine trust in those nations, and make other countries think twice before placing their reserves in the care of those countries. According to him, nearly half of Moscow’s assets were “simply stolen” by the West.

Addressing people in the West, the Russian leader said the massive sanctions imposed on Russia were already backfiring on the US and Europe themselves, with governments there trying hard to convince their citizens that Russia was to blame.

Putin warned ordinary people in the West that attempts to portray Moscow as the primary source of all their woes were lies, with a lot of those issues being the direct result of the Western governments’ “ambitions” and “political short-sightedness.”

The Western elites, according to Putin, have turned their countries into an “empire of lies,” but Russia will keep on presenting its own position to the whole world, no matter what.

Russia makes new claims on US-financed biolabs in Ukraine

The US has “covered” Ukraine with a network of biolaboratories linked to the Pentagon, the Russian Defense Ministry says

The Ukrainian authorities have been urgently destroying pathogens studied at its laboratories linked to the US Department of Defense, the Russian military claimed on Monday, adding that such activities hint at the military purposes of these studies.

As many as 30 biological laboratories have been established in Ukraine that are actively cooperating with the US military, the commander of the Russian radiological, chemical and biological defense force, Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, said at a news briefing on Monday.

The list of these laboratories’ partners includes the Pentagon’s Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) – the largest biomedical research facility administered by the US military; the general added.

Many of these laboratories have been active since the 2014 coup d’état in Ukraine and their emergence in the country has coincided with a spike in infectious diseases in the region, including German measles, diphtheria and tuberculosis, the Russian military said.

After the Russian forces launched a military operation in Ukraine on February 24, these laboratories started hastily destroying the materials they had been working on, including the highly pathogenic bacterial and viral agents, Kirillov has said, adding that Moscow has obtained documents related to that process.

Analysis of the documents shows that the laboratories had been working with dangerous infections such as anthrax and the plague. “Assortment and the excessive quantity of the biological agents suggest that the work done in these laboratories had been part of some military biological programs,” the general has said, adding that just one such laboratory in the western Ukrainian city of Lvov had destroyed as many as 320 containers with pathogens causing plague, swamp fever and Malta fever among others.

If these collections fall into the hands of the Russian experts, they will highly likely prove Ukraine and the US have been in violation of the Biological Weapons Convention,” Kirillov has said, adding that “this is the only reason that can explain the hasty destruction” of those materials.

The general has also expressed his concerns that all the biological materials needed for the alleged military biological program to continue had been already transported to the US.

Kiev has denied developing bioweapons, and Washington has not commented on the Russian military statements so far.

Moscow has been raising alarm about the activities of the US-financed biological laboratories located in the former Soviet states for quite some time. Earlier, it pointed to the Lugar Research Center – a US-funded laboratory in Georgia – as a place where some dangerous experiments are being conducted.

The Pentagon brushed off such accusations as a “Russian disinformation campaign” at that time.

Ukrainian president urges boosted air protection for defense against Russia: ‘We need you right now’; tells Biden, ‘Being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace’

Zelensky is being encouraged to talk dangerous ignorant rubbish about World War II in order to effectively start World War III. The Russians have reached the point of no return thanks to NATO and disinformation etc. They cannot be expected just to obey warnings not to fly over Ukraine. They will be shot down by ‘who knows.’

Zelensky wants the U.S and UK in there, with the best planes and pilots. Even just the aircraft from outside , will be an act of war. Zelensky is so self important because of NATO’s appetite for proxy wars, he wants World War with Russia, which will suck China in, faster than the best Dyson vacuum cleaner.

Is Biden as stupid as he pretends to be ? By Roberta Jane Cook.

Comment This stupid arrogant woman is lucky to have gotten away with a fine. Of course here in the west, she is a hero ( not allowed to say heroine anymore ) because she is effectively and powerfully being used for western propaganda.

If Putin has any sense, while under such enormous pressure, he will leave her alone rather than martyr her for more western benefit. She was not employed to undermine Russia’s painful and strategic war. NATO do not have the moral high ground. Their war crimes are abundant and are never investigated – which is why they persecuted Chelsea Manning and Julian Assange.

NATO know perfectly well how they have fermented this murderous conflict. They only care about resources, power and wealth. They welcomed the oligarchs and laundered their money. Now the hypocrites want to punish them if they don’t abandon Putin. Absolutely incredible hypocrisy, revealing NATO, Johnson and the EU for what they are. Let us hope that Biden is not as stupid as he pretends to be. R J Cook

Zelensky: Ukraine Must Recognize It Will Not Join NATO

By Jack Phillips March 15, 2022 Updated: March 15, 2022

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country has to accept that it will not become a member of the NATO military alliance, a critical Russian concern that was used to justify the invasion.

“Ukraine is not a member of NATO. We understand that. We have heard for years that the doors were open, but we also heard that we could not join. It’s a truth and it must be recognized,” Zelensky said during a video conference with the UK-led Joint Expeditionary Force on Tuesday.

He also again urged Western allies to provide Ukraine with fighter planes.

Read More Zelensky: Ukraine Must Recognize It Will Not Join NATO (theepochtimes.com)

Comment Zelensky ultimately is not in charge of Ukraine. NATO is. He is their place man and cannot go off message or he will be replaced. NATO wanted this war because they need to control and degrade Russia. This is because they fear an alliance with their ultimate economic and military competitor, China. The higher the death toll and the more they can deceive, the better it is for NATO. Putin is being lured into the dictator trap. If this continues, the cost to the global economy and social order will be enormous.

Britain, led by Boris, is a special danger; If the U.S joins in we have world war in the open. Then the masses will wonder why. Johnson thinks he is another Churchill so it suits him to portray Putin as his Hitler. Churchill was an appalling politician, coming to power when no one else wanted the job. But at least he was toff who had seen military service and combat. Johnson is a dangerous fantasist. R J Cook

How the Kremlin is resorting to Spetsnaz mercenaries and Syrian ‘volunteers’ to bolster Ukraine invasion

Cahal Milmo

Vladimir Putin is increasingly resorting to irregular forces including Russian mercenaries and Syrian fighters to bolster his invasion army in Ukraine after suffering significant losses, according to military analysts.

Some 400 Syrian troops, reportedly being paid $1,500 (£1,100) a month, are claimed to have arrived at training facilities in eastern Russian and southern Belarus in recent days as part of an initial contingent sent by the regime of dictator and Kremlin ally Bashar Al Assad.

NATO planners are updating the US “nuclear sharing” program to account for most

European allies planning to buy F-35 joint strike fighter jets, the military bloc’s director of nuclear policy said this week. Lockheed Martin’s fifth-generation fighter has been embraced by multiple US allies, including most recently Germany, despite the Pentagon’s own misgivings about the program.“We’re moving fast and furiously towards F-35 modernization and incorporating those into our planning and into our exercising and things like that as those capabilities come online,” Jessica Cox, director of the NATO nuclear policy directorate in Brussels, said on Wednesday, adding that “By the end of the decade, most if not all of our allies will have transitioned” to the F-35.Cox spoke during an online discussion hosted by the Advanced Nuclear Weapons Alliance Deterrence Center (ANWA DC), a US think tank, according to Defense News.Her remarks come a month after Berlin said Germany would replace its aging Tornado jets with F-35s, committing to buy up to three dozen and specifically citing the nuclear sharing mission as factoring in the decision.Cox said that other NATO allies currently operating the F-35, such as Poland, Denmark, and Norway, might be asked to support nuclear sharing missions in the future, adding that NATO “will also have some operational advantages with the F-35 since there will be opportunities for enhanced networking and integration across the force.”In addition to Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, and Turkey are currently hosting an estimated 150 US nuclear weapons – mainly B-61 gravity bombs, intended to be carried by smaller fighter-bombers like the Tornado or the F-16 – according to estimates by British think tank Chatham House.Finland and Sweden have recently voiced a desire to join NATO, and Helsinki already announced it would buy some 60 F-35s in early February. Russia has responded by saying it would be forced to reposition some of its troops and nuclear deterrent accordingly.The US first deployed some of its nuclear bombs in Europe in the 1960s. Ending this program was high on the list of security demands Moscow presented to the US and NATO in December 2021, which were rejected in January – a month before the escalation of hostilities in Ukraine.Russia launched its military offensive in Ukraine on February 24, following Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the 2014 German and French-brokered Minsk Protocol, designed to give the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. Moscow has now recognized the Donbass republics as independent states, and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc.The F-35 was originally proposed as a cost-effective modular design that could replace multiple older models in service with the US Air Force, Navy, and the Marines. In reality, it turned into three distinct designs with a lifetime project cost of over $1.7 trillion, the most expensive weapons program in US history.In addition to the price tag, the fifth-generation stealth fighter has also been plagued with performance issues, to the point where the new USAF chief of staff requested a study into a different aircraft in February 2021.General Charles Q. Brown Jr. compared the F-35 to a “high end” sports car, a Ferrari one drives on Sundays only, and sought proposals for a “clean sheet design” of a “5th-gen minus” workhorse jet instead. Multiple US outlets characterized his proposal as a “tacit admission” that the F-35 program had failed.",https://vk.com/wall267893108?offset=100

A recent controversial Johns Hopkins meta-analysis reignites a discussion about the adverse consequences of lockdowns after finding they had no significant mortality benefit during the first wave of the 2020 pandemic in the United States and Europe, according to a recent report .

“We find no evidence that lockdowns, school closures, border closures, and limiting gatherings have had a noticeable effect on COVID-19 mortality,” said the authors of the study, which is not peer-reviewed and reflects the authors’ views, not necessarily those of the university .

The study authors, however, did find closing nonessential businesses reduced COVID-19 mortality by 10.6%, which is likely most related to the closure of bars .

‘SHOULD BE REJECTED OUT OF HAND’: LOCKDOWNS ONLY REDUCED COVID DEATH RATE BY .2%, STUDY FINDS

“Our study shows the benefits [of lockdowns] — in terms of fewer deaths — are questionable and small,” Jonas Herby, special advisor at the Center for Political Studies in Copenhagen, Denmark, told Fox News. Herby’s research focuses on law and economics, and he is a co-author of the study.

The meta-analysis – a survey or study of previous studies – which Herby wrote along with two other prominent economists, noted lockdowns have had “devastating effects” as society weathers the unintended consequences.

“They have contributed to reducing economic activity, rising unemployment, reducing schooling, causing political unrest, contributing to domestic violence, and undermining liberal democracy,” the report noted .

The research directly contradicts the most influential model for lockdowns led by epidemiologist Neil Ferguson, which was largely responsible for “driving the world’s response to COVID-19” that “jarred the U.S. and the U.K. to action,” according to The Wall Street Journal .

Ferguson co-wrote a prominent paper in Nature published in June 2020 that estimated lockdowns in the spring of that year saved three million European lives. But the study excluded the research because it relied on modeling, according to multiple reports .

“This report on the effect of ‘lockdowns’ does not significantly advance our understanding of the relative effectiveness of the plethora of public health measures adopted by different countries to limit COVID-19 transmission,” Ferguson posted on Science Media Centre , a United Kingdom liaison of information for science and health journalists.

Ferguson resigned his government post on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies in May 2020 after breaking lockdown protocol himself when his lover, Antonia Staats, crossed London from her family home to visit him on at least two occasions while lockdown measures were imposed, according to the Guardian.

MAJOR MEDIA IGNORE STUDY FINDING COVID LOCKDOWNS INEFFECTIVE

The Johns Hopkins researchers acknowledged a limitation of the study was excluding certain studies like Ferguson’s to avoid biases, such as those brought on by “time-dependent factors” like seasonality. So papers that looked at early lockdowns such as in China, which suppressed COVID-19 to very low death rates, were also not included, according to a United Kingdom report .

Nevertheless, lockdown proponents are now weathering the aftershocks that persist after the lockdowns have been lifted, according to multiple reports.

“There are long-term health consequences from the virus, including long COVID, and there are long-term mental health impacts from the death due to COVID-19 of a parent, spouse, grandparent, caregiver,” said Dr. Julie Vaishampayan, chair of the public health committee for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

“There are long-term health impacts of the measures used to slow down the spread of this virus.”

By the end of June 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that, due to COVID-19 concerns, approximately 41% of United States adults delayed or avoided medical care, including 12% who avoided urgent or emergency care and 32% who neglected routine care. Those findings noted a higher prevalence among people with multiple medical problems, Black and Hispanic adults, young adults, and persons with disabilities, according to a past Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report .

Even though most students are now back in school, many now struggle academically from the consequences of months of online learning, while some others opted to switch schools or even drop out, according to a recent New York Times report .

The Times also noted that students continue to have persistent feelings of loneliness and anxiety with the sense that the system has failed them and created responsibilities that are not typically expected of them .

“Today’s kids will have to shoulder this burden along with diminished skills, thanks to the distance-learning disaster demanded by so many so-called experts in public health,” said James Freeman, assistant editor of The Wall Street Journal’s editorial page, a Fox News contributor and frequent host of “Deep Dive” on Fox Nation .

The New England Journal of Medicine reviewed the psychological impact of people in quarantine, finding “numerous emotional outcomes, including stress, depression, irritability, insomnia, fear, confusion, anger, frustration, boredom and stigma associated with quarantine, some of which persisted after the quarantine was lifted .”

“The president has been clear that we are not pushing lockdowns, we have not been pro-lockdown, that has not been his agenda,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said when asked about the Johns Hopkins paper at a recent press briefing .

Kramer', 'Mike Ives', 'Alexandra Stevenson', 'John Yoon', 'Azi Paybarah', 'David Moll']",2022-03-03 00:00:00,"A fire broke out early Friday at a complex in southern Ukraine housing Europe’s largest nuclear power plant after Russian troops fired on the area, and the Russian military later took control of the site, Ukrainian officials said.

Security camera footage verified by The New York Times showed a building ablaze inside the Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex near a line of military vehicles. The videos appeared to show people in the vehicles firing at buildings in the power plant. Ukraine’s state emergency service later said the blaze went out after 6 a.m.

The fire did not affect essential equipment at the plant, the International Atomic Energy Agency said on Twitter, citing its communication with the Ukrainian government.

About an hour after dawn, Ukraine’s nuclear regulatory inspectorate said in a statement that Russian military forces were now occupying the complex. It said that all of the site’s power units remained intact and that no changes in radiation levels had been observed.

The fire broke out after a Russian attack on a training building outside the perimeter of the plant, according to a statement by Ukraine’s state emergency service. A spokesman for the nuclear plant, Andriy Tuz, was quoted by The Associated Press as telling Ukrainian television that shells had set fire to one of the plant’s six reactors that was under renovation and not operating.

Ukraine’s nuclear inspectorate later said in its statement that one unit of the six units was operating, another was in “outage,” two were being cooled down, and two others had been disconnected from the grid.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine had accused the Russian military of deliberately attacking the complex and said an explosion there would have been “the end for everybody, the end of Europe.”

“Only immediate actions by Europe could stop the Russian army,” he added.

President Biden spoke with Mr. Zelensky about the fire and joined him in urging Russia to “cease its military activities in the area and allow firefighters and emergency responders to access the site,” the White House said. Local reports later said that emergency crews had gained access.

Mr. Biden’s energy secretary, Jennifer M. Granholm, said on Twitter that the United States had not detected elevated radiation readings in the area, echoing an earlier assessment by the International Atomic Energy Agency. “The plant’s reactors are protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down,” she said.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain said he would seek an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council about the blaze at the complex, according to his office.

Before the fire was reported by Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, the director general for the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement that “a large number of Russian tanks and infantry” had entered Enerhodar, a town next to the plant. The director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said that troops were “moving directly” toward the reactor site.

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex, on the Dnieper River roughly a hundred miles north of Crimea, is the largest in Europe. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, its six reactors produce a total of 6,000 megawatts of electric power.

In comparison, the Chernobyl plant in northern Ukraine produced 3,800 megawatts — about a third less. (A megawatt, one million watts, is enough power to light 10,000 hundred-watt bulbs.) The four reactors of the Chernobyl complex were shut down after one suffered a catastrophic fire and meltdown in 1986.

The reactors’ cores are full of highly radioactive fuel. But an additional danger at the Zaporizhzhia site is the many acres of open pools of water behind the complex where spent fuel rods have been cooled for years. Experts fear that errant shells or missiles that hit such sites could set off radiological disasters.

For days, social media reports have detailed how the residents of Enerhodar set up a giant barrier of tires, vehicles and metal barricades to try to block a Russian advance into the city and the reactor site. Christoph Koettl, a visual investigator for The New York Times, noted on Twitter that the barricades were so large that they could be seen from outer space by orbiting satellites.

Starting this past Sunday, three days into the invasion, Ukraine’s nuclear regulator began reporting an unusual rate of disconnection: Six of the nation’s 15 reactors were offline. On Tuesday, the Zaporizhzhia facility was the site with the most reactors offline.

US Sen. Rob Portman, co-chair of the Ukraine caucus, said Sunday that getting fighter planes to Ukraine, including MiG-29s, is essential as Russia intensifies its attacks on the country.

“What we have heard directly from the Ukrainians is they want them badly. They want the ability to have better control over the skies in order to give them a fighting chance,” Portman, a Republican from Ohio, told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.”

The Pentagon said last week the US was opposed to a Polish plan to transfer fighter jets to Ukraine through the US and a German air base “at this time.” CNN previously reported that NATO members have expressed concerns that providing fighter jets to Ukraine -- even if done bilaterally -- could be perceived by Russia as the alliance becoming directly involved in the war. National security adviser Jake Sullivan told Bash on Sunday the US is focused on providing other anti-air systems that could help Ukrainians make progress.

Portman, who is in Poland, said he is not sure why the US is hesitating on sending the fighter aircraft after the US has already sent other military equipment, including Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, to Ukraine and said, “the airplanes are also essential.”

“And to me, you know, Vladimir Putin and the Russians seem to be saying everything is escalatory and yet they are escalating every single day by coming into Ukraine with these weapons,” he said. “So, as they escalate, what the Ukrainian people are asking for is just the ability to defend themselves. Give them the ability to try to stop some of this Russian superiority in terms of air power to be able to save lives and to hopefully end up with a peaceful solution to this.”",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-13-22/h_fc270e92e35926b4a9e64442aff4ef80

The Yavoriv International Center for Peacekeeping and Security, roughly 15 miles from the Polish border, was hit by a Russian airstrike overnight. The facility is just outside of the western Ukrainian city of Lviv.

Regional governor Maksym Kozytskyy said Russian planes fired around 30 rockets at the facility, adding that some were intercepted before they hit. At least 35 people were killed and 134 wounded, he said.

'Look, this is the third now military facility or airfield that the Russians had struck in western Ukraine in just the last couple of days,' Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said on ABC's This Week.

'So, clearly, at least from an airstrike perspective, they're broadening their target sets.'

He said no Americans were killed, with US support troops who had been there to train Ukraine's defense force having pulled out weeks ago.

The attack came a day after Russia's deputy foreign minister warned convoys of Western arms shipments to Ukraine could be considered legitimate targets.

Ukraine's defense minister called the airstrike 'a terror attack near the NATO border' and again reiterated Kyiv's calls to impose a no-fly zone over their country.

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the US was concerned about NATO's eastern flank, where Poland is, but said the attack on Ukraine near its border would not be enough to push Americans into direct military conflict with Russia

The White House and its allies have repeatedly refused to take such a step, claiming it could be a catalyst for World War III. Kirby said as much on Sunday.

'Look, I mean, no-fly zone has a nice air policing sound to it, but I participated in one as a young officer on an aircraft carrier way back in the early ‘90s. It is combat. You have to be willing to shoot and to be shot at,' he claimed.

'President Biden has made it clear that US troops are not going to be fighting in Ukraine, and there's a good reason for that, because the United States getting involved in combat in Ukraine right now or over the skies of Ukraine right now leads to war with Russia.'

The retired admiral added, 'And there's very little that you can see that would make sense for this war to be escalated between two nuclear powers.'

He said the US took its commitment to its Article 5 duties under NATO 'very seriously' when asked about whether an attack like the one that hit the military complex overnight were to land on the other side of Ukraine's border with Poland -- a NATO state.

'An armed attack against one is considered an armed attack against all,' Kirby said. 'We've made it very clear to Russia that NATO territory will be defended not just by the United States, but by our allies.'

President Joe Biden's National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the strike on the Yavoriv International Center was a sign that Russia's autocratic leader Vladimir Putin was growing 'frustrated' by Ukrainians' fierce resistance slowing down his invasion.

'What it shows is that Vladimir Putin is frustrated by the fact that his forces are not making the kind of progress that he thought that they would make against major cities, including Kyiv, that he is expanding the number of targets, that he is lashing out, and that he is trying to cause damage in every part of the country,' Sullivan said in a CNN interview Sunday.

However he too stressed that neither the attack's proximity to a NATO ally nor its distance from the supposed battlefront would push the US further toward a confrontation with Russia.

'What President Biden has made clear from the beginning is that we will not have U.S. military forces operating in Ukraine, and there are none operating there now. But we will defend every inch of NATO territory, even as we seek to provide military assistance to the Ukrainian fighters who are bravely defending their homes and bravely defending their cities,' Sullivan said.

Meanwhile residents of the capital Kyiv woke again to the sound of air raid sirens and city authorities said they were stockpiling two weeks worth of essential food items for the 2 million people who have not yet fled from Russian forces attempting to encircle the city.

Ukraine also reported renewed air strikes on an airport in the west, heavy shelling on Chernihiv northeast of the capital and attacks on the southern town of Mykolayiv, where officials said nine people had been killed.

An American journalist was shot and killed by Russian forces in the town of Irpin, northwest of Kyiv, and another journalist was wounded, the regional police chief said.

Despite significant manpower and equipment advantages, Putin’s army has not overrun a much smaller Ukrainian defense force. The capital of Kyiv remains in Ukraine’s control, as does the strategic port city of Odesa, in the southwest part of the country.

At times, Russian forces have appeared overstretched and inept. Pentagon officials have reported that Putin’s army is struggling to feed its troops and fuel its vehicles. Morale is low.

So why was the Russian army so unprepared?

“They made the two biggest mistakes you can make in warfare — they underestimated their opponent and they overestimated their own abilities,” said Dan Emmett, a military expert and former U.S. Marine.

Emmett said the resolve of the Ukrainians, coupled with the Russians’ lack of fighting experience and unfamiliarity with the terrain, has made it especially difficult for the invaders.

putin’s miscalculation

Experts believe Putin expected to capture the Ukrainian capital Kyiv in a matter of days. If he had done so, the Russian president could have ousted Zelenskyy and installed his own pro-Russia government. But that didn’t happen. Instead, Russian troops met stiff Ukrainian resistance and Putin’s soldiers, who were supplied for a short campaign, suddenly found themselves underprepared.

“Putin’s military plan to quickly capture Ukraine, it is clear now, has failed,” Ned Price, State Department spokesman, told reporters on Thursday.

The Russian army’s missteps have played out in videos circulated on social media around the world — armored vehicles bogged down in mud and entire tank convoys ambushed by Ukrainian troops.

For days, satellite images showed a massive Russian military convey stretching 40 miles long sitting stalled outside Kyiv. Once considered among the most powerful fighting forces in the world, the Russian army now appears vulnerable.

That perceived weakness on a global stage has some worried that Putin will escalate the conflict to overcompensate for his army’s lack of progress.

“It looks to me like they’re probably going to hit the cities much, much harder and then only go in with troops after they have destroyed much of the cities,” retired Army Lt. Col. Daniel Davis told NewsNation. “I do fear it could get a lot worse.”

Davis said Russia does not have enough troops to attack each major city one-by-one. Instead, he expects Putin’s forces to use missiles to bombard population centers, given their significant combat power.

Other sectors of Russia’s military have also underperformed. Once thought to be a sure thing, the Russian air force has not established air superiority over Ukraine. That means air support for ground forces has been limited, another contributing factor to the slowed advance.

ukrainian resistance

Above all, experts think Putin greatly underestimated the strength of his opponent. Led by a determined president, Ukrainians of all ages have rallied together to defend their country.

“When you push somebody into a corner and take their home, try and take their cities, they’re going to fight,” said Emmett.

In addition to miscalculating the Ukrainians’ resolve, Emmett thinks Putin overestimated the capabilities of his own troops, many of whom were not battle tested.

“Quite frankly, the Russian army is not that good. It’s made up primarily of conscripts. Some of them don’t even speak Russian. A lot of them don’t even know why they’re in (Ukraine),” he said.

Despite their slow start, Russian forces have advanced in recent days, gaining ground in the push toward Kyiv. But even if Putin’s army reorganizes and defeats Ukraine with more brutal war tactics, Emmett said the resistance inside Ukraine would likely continue, possibly until the invaders leave.

“You’re going to get into phase two, you’re going to get guerrilla warfare, insurgency warfare,” said Emmett.",https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/why-has-putins-army-struggled-against-ukraine/

Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters on Monday:

Fallout from deadly airstrike near Polish border

On Sunday, Russian long-range bombers launched ""more than a couple dozen"" cruise missiles at a western Ukrainian training facility near Yavoriv, about 10 miles from the Polish border. All of the missiles were launched from Russian airspace, damaging at least seven buildings, according to the official.

The attack left at least 35 dead and 134 wounded, according to Ukrainian officials.

Russia also hit two airfields in western Ukraine on Friday in the towns of Lutsk and Ivano-Frankovsk.

During a Monday press briefing at the Pentagon, press secretary John Kirby said the strikes in western Ukraine are part of a broadening Russian assault across Ukraine.

""I wouldn't think that that we would consider this or the other strikes in western Ukraine as some sort of turning point,"" Kirby said, but adding, ""The Russians clearly are expanding some of their targets sets.""

""If Mr. Putin was trying to signal his displeasure about a strong, united NATO with this war of his then he's failed, because he's getting exactly what he says he doesn't want -- a strong, united NATO on his Western flank,"" Kirby said.

While there were 150 Florida National Guardsmen training Ukrainians on part of the base as recently as February, all U.S. troops and contractors were pulled from the country before the beginning of the invasion.

The strike occurred after the Kremlin claimed arms shipments to Ukraine are ""legitimate targets,"" but the U.S. official said no security assistance sites were hit in this case.

Kirby confirmed the training center was not being used to funnel U.S. weapons to Ukrainian forces.

""I would just tell you that we have multiple routes to get security assistance into the hands of the Ukrainians,"" Kirby said.

In total, Russia has now launched more than 900 missiles against Ukraine, according to the senior U.S. defense official. This estimate is up from 810 on Friday.

Reports of Russia seeking military supplies from China

""I would just say that we're going to watch that very, very closely. And as others in the administration have said, if China does choose to materially support Russia in this war, there will likely be consequences for China,"" the official said.

Cease-fire talks

""We want to see the violence stop,"" the official said. ""All I can do is tell you what we're seeing on the ground, and what we're seeing on the ground is a continued military effort to subdue these population centers and to do it now with ever more violence using more and more long-range fires, which are increasingly indiscriminate in terms of what they're hitting.""

Russian advance mostly stalled

""Almost all of Russia's advances remain stalled,"" the official said.

Kyiv: The Russians closest to Kyiv are still near Hostomel Airport to the northwest, about 9 miles (15km) from city center. Some troops are moving in behind those advance forces, ""but not at a great pace,"" the official said.

The forces approaching from the east are still about 12-19 miles from the heart of Kyiv, according to the official. This was the same estimate given by the official on Friday.

""No real progress to speak to,"" the official said of these forces.

They're facing heavy resistance from the Ukrainians. The U.S. assesses the defenders still have control of Brovary, just east of the capital, where in videos published last week we saw a column of Russian tanks hit.

Kharkiv: Significant fighting continues over Kharkiv, with Russians relying more and more on long-range missile attacks.

The U.S. sees a new line of advance with 50 to 60 vehicles moving from the southwest of Kharkiv down toward the town of Izyum.

""The assessment is that they are trying to block off the Donbass area and to prevent the flow westward of any Ukrainian armed forces that would be in the in the eastern part of the country, prevent them from coming to the assistance of other Ukrainian defenders near Kyiv,"" the official said.

Mariupol: The city remains isolated and under heavy bombardment, with Russian forces to the north and east. Ukrainians continue to fight back, the official said.

Mykolayiv: Russian forces remain roughly where they were Friday, about six to nine miles northeast of the city. Ukrainians continue to resist.

It is unclear what the Russian plan is for Mykolayiv.

""It could be a left turn to move on Odessa from the ground or it could be they go north up towards Kiev,"" the official said.

Odessa: The Pentagon still sees no sign of any looming amphibious assault on Odessa, according to the official.

Ukrainians going after Russian supplies

""The Ukrainians, as we've said all along, they've been quite creative here. They're not simply going after combat capability -- tanks and armored vehicles and shooting down aircraft -- although they're doing all that. They are also deliberately trying to impede and prevent the Russians' ability to sustain themselves,"" the official said, citing the long Russian convoy as one example.",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/base-russia-struck-poland-funnel-weapons-pentagon-ukraine/story?id=83437698

A town councilor for Brovary east of Kyiv was killed in fighting there, regional administration chief Oleksiy Kuleba said on Ukrainian television. He also reported strikes overnight on the northwest towns of Irpin, Bucha and Hostomel, which have seen some of the worst fighting in Russia's stalled attempt to take the capital.

The general staff of Ukraine's armed forces said Monday morning that Russian troops have not made major advances over the past 24 hours despite expanding strikes to the west.

Ukrainian forces are targeting Russian bases, targeting their logistical abilities, the general staff said in a statement on Facebook marking the 19th day of the war.

The general staff accused Russian forces of setting up firing positions and military equipment in churches and other civilian infrastructure so that Ukrainian forces can't fire back. The accusation could not be immediately verified, though Associated Press reporters have seen Russian armoured vehicles in residential areas.

An artillery strike hit a nine-story apartment building in the Obolonsky district of northern Kyiv on Monday morning, destroying apartments on several floors and igniting a fire.

Mr. Renaud, 50, had worked for a number of American news and media organizations in the past, including HBO, NBC and The New York Times. The Ukrainian authorities said he was killed in Irpin, a suburb that has been the site of intense shelling by Russian forces in recent days, but the details of his death were not immediately clear. Ukrainian officials said another journalist was wounded as well.

At the time of his death Mr. Renaud was on assignment for Time Studios working on a “project focused on the global refugee crisis,” according to a statement from Time executives.

An American journalist was killed in Ukraine when he and a colleague came under fire near the capital, Kyiv, regional police and a government official have said.

Russian troops opened fire on the car of Brent Renaud and another journalist in Irpin, about 10km (6 miles) northwest of the capital, the Kyiv police force said in a statement on Sunday. It said the injured journalist was taken to a hospital in Kyiv.

The adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, Anton Herashchenko, confirmed the incident on a Telegram channel.

There was no immediate comment from the Russian authorities.

The journalist being treated at the hospital said he and a colleague were shot after they were stopped at a checkpoint just after a bridge in Irpin.

Juan Arredondo told Italian journalist Annalisa Camilli in an interview from the hospital before being taken for surgery that the colleague who was with him was hit in the neck and remained on the ground earlier on Sunday.

Camilli told The Associated Press news agency that she was at the hospital when Arredondo arrived and that Arredondo himself had been wounded, hit in the lower back when stopped at a Russian checkpoint.

He told Camilli that he and Renaud were filming refugees fleeing the area when they were shot at while in a car approaching a checkpoint. The driver turned around but the firing at them continued, Arredondo added.

Arredondo said an ambulance took him to the hospital and that Renaud was “left behind”.

The New York Times, responding to reports that Renaud was a reporter for the paper, said he had previously worked for it but had not been on assignment for the Times in Ukraine.

“We are deeply saddened to hear of Brent Renaud’s death,” a spokesperson for the paper said on Twitter, naming the journalist thought to have been killed.

“Brent was a talented filmmaker who had contributed to The New York Times over the years.”

“Early reports that he worked for Times circulated because he was wearing a Times press badge that had been issued for an assignment many years ago.”

Asked about the reports, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CBS News that the United States government would be consulting with the Ukrainians to determine how this happened and would then “execute appropriate consequences”.

236,95de23d4-db18-413c-aacc-25b6265525d0,['The Associated Press'],,"Brent Renaud, an acclaimed filmmaker who travelled to some of the darkest and most dangerous corners of the world for documentaries that transported audiences to little-known places of suffering, died Sunday after Russian forces opened fire on his vehicle in Ukraine.

The 50-year-old Little Rock, Ark., native was gathering material for a report about refugees when his vehicle was hit at a checkpoint in Irpin, just outside the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. Ukraine's Interior Ministry said the area has sustained intense shelling by Russian forces in recent days.

Renaud was one of the most respected independent producers of his era, said Christof Putzel, a filmmaker and close friend who had received a text from Renaud just three days before his death. Renaud and Putzel won a 2013 Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University journalism award for Arming the Mexican Cartels, a documentary on how guns trafficked from the United States fuelled rampant drug gang violence.

""This guy was the absolute best,"" Putzel told The Associated Press via phone from New York City. ""He was just the absolute best war journalist that I know. This is a guy who literally went to every conflict zone.""

The details of Renaud's death were not made immediately clear by Ukrainian authorities, but American journalist Juan Arredondo said the two were travelling in a vehicle toward the Irpin checkpoint when they were both shot. Arredondo, speaking from a hospital in Kyiv, told Italian journalist Annalisa Camilli that Renaud was hit in the neck. Camilli told the AP that Arredondo himself had been hit in the lower back.

""We crossed the first bridge in Irpin, we were going to film other refugees leaving, and we got into a car, somebody offered to take us to the other bridge, we crossed the checkpoint, and they started shooting at us,"" Arredondo told Camilli in a video interview shared with the AP.

A statement from Kyiv regional police said that Russian troops opened fire on the car. Hours after the shooting of Renaud, Irpin mayor Oleksandr Markushyn said journalists would be denied entry to the city.

""In this way, we want to save the lives of both them and our defenders,"" Markushyn said.

The U.S. State Department issued a statement condemning attacks on news professionals and others documenting the conflict.

""We are horrified that journalists and filmmakers—noncombatants—have been killed and injured in Ukraine by Kremlin forces,"" the department said via Twitter. ""This is yet another gruesome example of the Kremlin's indiscriminate actions.""

Responding to news of Renaud's death, the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists called for an immediate halt to violence against journalists and other civilians.

""This kind of attack is totally unacceptable, and is a violation of international law,"" the committee said on Twitter.

'Nowhere was too dangerous'

Along with his brother Craig, Renaud won a Peabody Award for Last Chance High, an HBO series about a school for at-risk youth on Chicago's West Side. The brothers' litany of achievements include two duPont-Columbia journalism awards and acclaimed productions for HBO, NBC, Discovery, PBS, the New York Times, and Vice News.

Renaud was also a 2019 Nieman fellow at Harvard and served as visiting distinguished professor for the Center for Ethics in Journalism at University of Arkansas. He and his brother founded the Little Rock Film Festival.

Among other assignments, Renaud covered wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the devastating 2011 earthquake in Haiti, political turmoil in Egypt and Libya and extremism in Africa.

This kind of attack is totally unacceptable, and is a violation of international law,” said Carlos Martinez de la Serna, CPJ’s program director, in New York. “Russian forces in Ukraine must stop all violence against journalists and other civilians at once, and whoever killed Renaud should be held to account.”

“We thank your country and your prime minister… for putting yourselves forward as peacemakers. I very much want to believe in this. But at the same time, I am certain that Putin will not stop. He will go on to the end. He wants to win, and take military control of Ukraine, but I can tell you that he won’t achieve this. Ukraine will fight so that victory is ours,” Tymoshenko says.

She says, “I thank Israel for formally declaring today that it stands with Ukraine.”

Israel has not yet made such a formal declaration, however. Tymoshenko appears to be referring to comments yesterday from Foreign Minister Lapid, who said Israel “condemns the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and calls for an end to the fighting.”

“There is no justification for violating Ukraine’s territorial integrity, and there is no justification for attacks on a civilian population,” Lapid said. “Israel will not be a route to bypass sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States and other Western countries.”

Bennett has refrained from taking a side in the conflict, however.

Tymoshenko says, “Today is really a turning point. Today your foreign minister said clearly that Israel will not be a country that allows the aggressor state to evade the sanctions. Nobody can stand in opposition [to Ukraine’s cause]. You have to be without a conscience, heartless and soulless, devoid of any human emotion to see what is happening in Ukraine and not to stand with it.”

Tymoshenko, Ukraine’s only female prime minister, quotes Israel’s only female prime minister, Ukraine-born Golda Meir.

“Regarding negotiations, I want to quote Golda Meir, who was your prime minister and was born in Kyiv. She said, ‘If the enemy lays down his weapons, there will be peace. If we lay down our weapons, there’ll be war.’ We will not lay down our weapons. We will continue to fight. We’ll continue to defend our country. And if peace talks can contribute, and stop the bloodshed, we will rejoice. But we will permit any limitations and any compromises that threaten our independence and territorial integrity.”

“I thank you very much [in Israel] for defending Ukraine,” she says.

Kramer', 'Mike Ives', 'Alexandra Stevenson', 'John Yoon', 'Azi Paybarah', 'David Moll']",2022-03-03 00:00:00,"A fire broke out early Friday at a complex in southern Ukraine housing Europe’s largest nuclear power plant after Russian troops fired on the area, and the Russian military later took control of the site, Ukrainian officials said.

Security camera footage verified by The New York Times showed a building ablaze inside the Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex near a line of military vehicles. The videos appeared to show people in the vehicles firing at buildings in the power plant. Ukraine’s state emergency service later said the blaze went out after 6 a.m.

The fire did not affect essential equipment at the plant, the International Atomic Energy Agency said on Twitter, citing its communication with the Ukrainian government.

About an hour after dawn, Ukraine’s nuclear regulatory inspectorate said in a statement that Russian military forces were now occupying the complex. It said that all of the site’s power units remained intact and that no changes in radiation levels had been observed.

The fire broke out after a Russian attack on a training building outside the perimeter of the plant, according to a statement by Ukraine’s state emergency service. A spokesman for the nuclear plant, Andriy Tuz, was quoted by The Associated Press as telling Ukrainian television that shells had set fire to one of the plant’s six reactors that was under renovation and not operating.

Ukraine’s nuclear inspectorate later said in its statement that one unit of the six units was operating, another was in “outage,” two were being cooled down, and two others had been disconnected from the grid.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine had accused the Russian military of deliberately attacking the complex and said an explosion there would have been “the end for everybody, the end of Europe.”

“Only immediate actions by Europe could stop the Russian army,” he added.

President Biden spoke with Mr. Zelensky about the fire and joined him in urging Russia to “cease its military activities in the area and allow firefighters and emergency responders to access the site,” the White House said. Local reports later said that emergency crews had gained access.

Mr. Biden’s energy secretary, Jennifer M. Granholm, said on Twitter that the United States had not detected elevated radiation readings in the area, echoing an earlier assessment by the International Atomic Energy Agency. “The plant’s reactors are protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down,” she said.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain said he would seek an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council about the blaze at the complex, according to his office.

Before the fire was reported by Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, the director general for the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement that “a large number of Russian tanks and infantry” had entered Enerhodar, a town next to the plant. The director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said that troops were “moving directly” toward the reactor site.

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex, on the Dnieper River roughly a hundred miles north of Crimea, is the largest in Europe. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, its six reactors produce a total of 6,000 megawatts of electric power.

In comparison, the Chernobyl plant in northern Ukraine produced 3,800 megawatts — about a third less. (A megawatt, one million watts, is enough power to light 10,000 hundred-watt bulbs.) The four reactors of the Chernobyl complex were shut down after one suffered a catastrophic fire and meltdown in 1986.

The reactors’ cores are full of highly radioactive fuel. But an additional danger at the Zaporizhzhia site is the many acres of open pools of water behind the complex where spent fuel rods have been cooled for years. Experts fear that errant shells or missiles that hit such sites could set off radiological disasters.

For days, social media reports have detailed how the residents of Enerhodar set up a giant barrier of tires, vehicles and metal barricades to try to block a Russian advance into the city and the reactor site. Christoph Koettl, a visual investigator for The New York Times, noted on Twitter that the barricades were so large that they could be seen from outer space by orbiting satellites.

Starting this past Sunday, three days into the invasion, Ukraine’s nuclear regulator began reporting an unusual rate of disconnection: Six of the nation’s 15 reactors were offline. On Tuesday, the Zaporizhzhia facility was the site with the most reactors offline.

In an 11-minute-long video, Zelenskyy reassured his Ukrainian viewers that international public opinion was favoring Ukraine in the conflict with Russia.

""You can take a public opinion poll in every country and you will see that Ukraine is among the leaders of those who are sympathized with and supported. And Russia is not just among the enemies, it is an even bigger enemy, bigger evil than North Korea,"" Zelenskyy said.

Zelenskyy also pleaded for more aid: ""I keep reiterating to our allies and friends abroad; they have to keep doing more for our country, for Ukrainians and Ukraine.

247,0d25c56e-a412-4086-9fa0-d02dd155e8ad,['Steve Herman'],,"Ukrainian officials say Russian troops fired artillery on suburbs of the capital, Kyiv, Monday, as Russian and Ukrainian delegations held a fourth round of talks without signs of a breakthrough.

The talks, which are taking place by video link rather than in neighboring Belarus as in the past, paused for the day, but are set to resume Tuesday.

Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted after the talks, ""Communication is being held yet it's hard."" He had raised hope of progress on Sunday by saying that Russia had been ""listening carefully to our proposals"" and was beginning to talk ""constructively.""

Officials in Kyiv say at least one person was killed when a shell hit a nine-story residential building in a northern district of the city early Monday. They say Russian forces also struck an airplane factory in the capital, sparking a large fire.

The violence comes a day after Russia launched a lethal cruise missile attack on a western Ukraine military base just 25 kilometers from NATO-member Poland. At least 35 people were killed and 134 wounded in the attack on the International Center for Peacekeeping and Security.

A senior U.S. defense official said Monday that ""almost all of Russia's advances remain stalled"" inside Ukraine. That includes Russian advance forces outside of Kyiv, which are about 15 kilometers from the city center, and a convoy of Russian troops around the city, according to the latest U.S. assessment.

In a rare positive development Monday, Ukrainian officials in the southern city of Mariupol said a convoy of civilian cars was able to leave the besieged city through a humanitarian corridor after many previous attempts to evacuate civilians collapsed. Officials said 160 cars left in the first two hours the corridor was open.

Ukrainian officials say as many as 2,500 civilians have died in the Mariupol since Russia began its attacks on the southern port city. The figure could not be independently confirmed.

Fox News reported one of its journalists, Benjamin Hall, was seriously injured Monday while reporting outside of Kyiv. The development comes one day after an American journalist was killed while reporting on the war. Brent Renaud, an award-winning filmmaker and reporter, died in Irpin, a suburb of Kyiv, according to officials.

Washington has dismissed Kyiv's appeals for a no-fly zone over the country and rejected a Polish proposal to send their Russian-made jets to a U.S. airbase in Germany to be sent to Ukraine. On Saturday, President Joe Biden authorized up to $200 million worth of American assistance in the form of military education and training for the Ukrainian army, following a previous security assistance package worth $350 million.

""Almost all"" of the initial $350 million package has been delivered to Ukraine, according to Pentagon press secretary John Kirby. He said work is starting on the next $200 million package and that the United States is working ""as fast as we can and as nimbly as we can.""

Four U.S. senators visited Poland over the weekend to speak to Ukrainian refugees. Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar said Congress is looking at more ways to boost Ukraine's defenses.

""We're not going to give (Russian President) Vladimir Putin a road map of how that can be done,"" she told VOA in Warsaw. ""There are many ways — whether it is more drones, whether it is other weapons — that we can help, and clearly we are all committed to doing that. We must do more.""

Members of the delegation also told VOA they were concerned about the humanitarian crisis the invasion has unleashed.

""It's heartbreaking to see what's happening,"" said Republican Senator Rob Portman, who is retiring this year. ""We had a chance to visit with refugees coming over the border and heard their stories of bombings and their homes being destroyed, families split up.""

Republican Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi told VOA he was ""angry"" over Russia's demands to hold on to its gains.

""I really reject any of this talk about a settlement whereby Ukraine would retain part of their territory and Russia would get to keep some of the conquered area,"" he said.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the decision by NATO countries not to initiate a no-fly zone over Ukraine is based on an ""analysis that I think we need to be prudent, even if I understand the dramatic appeal of the Ukrainian government.""

In Russia, an anti-war protester interrupted state TV’s Channel One evening news broadcast in Moscow, holding a poster that said ""No War"" in English, and underneath those words, “Stop the war. Don’t believe the propaganda. Here they are lying to you,” in Russian.

The poster was signed in English, ""Russians against the war.""

Talks with China

In another development Monday, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan and officials from the National Security Council and the State Department met in Rome with China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi.

The talks included a ""substantial discussion of Russia's war against Ukraine,"" according to the White House, and ""also underscored the importance of maintaining open lines of communication between the United States and China.""

Media reports emerged Sunday that Moscow has requested military and economic assistance from China for Russia's war in Ukraine. Earlier, the White House warned China of severe ""consequences"" if it helps Russia avoid sanctions.

State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters Monday that the United States is watching very closely the extent to which China or any other country provides any form of support to Russia.

""We have communicated very clearly to Beijing that we won't stand by, we will not allow any country to compensate Russia for its losses,"" he said.

Chinese arms sales to Russia would have ""a devastating impact on the U.S.- China relationship, because it would clearly align the Chinese with the Russians, against the United States, Europe in a war,"" Robert Ross, a political science professor of at Boston College, told VOA.

China is in a unique position because of its partnership agreement with Russia, according to Stephen Roach, a senior fellow at Yale University's Jackson Institute of Global Affairs. He told VOA that China has ""considerably greater"" leverage over Russia than even Western countries that have implemented ""unprecedented sanctions"" on Russia.

""China has something that the West does not have, and that is the partnership"" with Russia, he said.

Sullivan on Sunday responded to growing concerns that Russia would use chemical weapons in Ukraine.

""We can't predict a time and place,"" he said on CBS, noting an escalation of rhetoric from Moscow falsely accusing the United States and Ukraine of developing chemical or biological weapons to use against Russian troops.

Ukraine's human rights ombudswoman said the Russians used a phosphorus munition in an overnight attack on the eastern Ukrainian city of Popasna in the Luhansk region.

VOA was not immediately able to verify the claim. While phosphorus is not considered a chemical weapon, its use against human beings is banned under international law.

Eastern European chief Myroslava Gongadze, White House correspondent Anita Powell, Senior diplomatic correspondent Cindy Saine, National security correspondent Jeff Seldin, U.N. correspondent Margaret Besheer, State Department Bureau Chief Nike Ching, and Mandarin Service reporters Lin Yang and Si Yang contributed to this report.

“They fired a huge amount of ammunition from a great distance,” he said on Facebook.

Gerashchenko said Russia wanted to test Ukraine’s coastal defense system.

He said there was no attempt to land troops. He didn’t say whether any of the shelling hit anything.

HERE’S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING TODAY:

LVIV, Ukraine — Ukraine said a fourth Russian general has been killed in the fighting.

Maj. Gen. Oleg Mityaev died Tuesday during the storming of Mariupol, said Ukrainian Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko, who published a photo on Telegram of what he said was the dead officer.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported the death of another Russian general in his nighttime address but didn’t name him.

Mityaev, 46, commanded the 150th motorized rifle division and had fought in Syria, Gerashchenko said.

There was no confirmation of the death from Russia.

The employee of Russian state television who was arrested after interrupting a live news program by protesting the war in Ukraine said she was not allowed to sleep in police custody and was interrogated for 14 hours.

“These were very difficult days of my life because I literally went two full days without sleep, the interrogation lasted for more than 14 hours and they didn’t allow me to contact my family and close friends, didn’t provide any legal support,” Marina Ovsyannikova said after she was released.

Ovsyannikova, an employee of Channel 1, walked into the studio during Monday’s evening news show with a poster saying “stop the war, don’t believe the propaganda, they are lying to you here.” In English, it said “no war” at the top of the poster and “Russians against the war” at the bottom.

In a video recorded before her action, she urged Russians to join anti-war protests and said that “Russia is the aggressor country and one person, Vladimir Putin, solely bears responsibility for that aggression.”

She was fined 30,000 rubles (about $270) on charges of organizing unsanctioned actions for her call to take part in demonstrations against the war.

The state news agency Tass said Ovsyannikova was fined for the video, not for her appearance during the news show.

She remains under investigation for that on-air protest, Tass said, citing a law enforcement source. Tass said Ovsyannikova is being investigated under a new law against the dissemination of “deliberately false information” about the use of Russian armed forces, which carries a prison sentence of up to 15 years.

LVIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said early Wednesday that Russia’s demands during negotiations are becoming “more realistic” after nearly three weeks of war. He said more time was needed for the talks, which are being held by video conference.

“Efforts are still needed, patience is needed,” he said in his nighttime video address to the nation. “Any war ends with an agreement.”

Zelenskyy, who is to address the U.S. Congress on Wednesday, thanked President Joe Biden and “all the friends of Ukraine” for $13.6 billion in new support included in a spending measure that Biden signed.

He appealed for more weapons and more sanctions to punish Russia, and repeated his call to “close the skies over Ukraine to Russian missiles and planes.”

He said Russian forces on Tuesday were unable to move deeper into Ukrainian territory and continued their heavy shelling of cities.

Over the past day, 28,893 civilians were able to flee the fighting along nine humanitarian corridors, although the Russians refused to allow aid into Mariupol, he said.

LVIV, Ukraine — Russian troops seized a hospital in Mariupol and took about 500 people hostage during another assault on the southern port city late Tuesday, regional leader Pavlo Kyrylenko said.

Russians troops drove 400 people from neighboring houses into Regional Intensive Care Hospital, Kyrylenko said on the messaging app Telegram. About 100 doctors and patients also are believed to be inside, he said.

The troops are using those inside the hospital as human shields and are not allowing anyone to leave, he said.

“It’s impossible to leave the hospital, they are shooting hard,” Kyrylenko said.

Kyrylenko said the main building of the hospital has been heavily damaged by shelling, but medical staff are continuing to treat patients in makeshift wards set up in the basement.

He called on the world to respond to these “gross violations of the norms and customs of war, these egregious crimes against humanity.”

The Ukrainian army’s General Staff says Russian troops are trying to block off the city from the western and eastern outskirts of the city. “There are significant losses,” it said in a Facebook post.

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden will announce on Wednesday that the U.S. is delivering $800 million in new military assistance to Ukraine, according to a White House official.

Biden is expected to detail the assistance during a speech on the situation in Ukraine.

The money will come out of $13.6 billion in additional military and humanitarian aid allocated for Ukraine in a broader $1.5 trillion government spending measure that Biden signed on Tuesday.

With the new round of aid, Biden will have committed $2 billion in assistance to Ukraine since taking office.

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is also scheduled to deliver video remarks to Congress Wednesday morning.

While officials are anticipating that Zelenskyy could once again call on the U.S. and West to send Ukraine fighter jets or help establish a “no-fly” zone, the Biden administration is looking to send Ukraine “more of what’s been working well,” including anti-armor and air defense weapons, according to the official who was not authorized to comment and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

LYIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian forces on Tuesday evening repelled an attack on Kharkiv by Russian troops, who tried to storm the city from their positions in Piatykhatky, a suburb 15 kilometers (9 miles) to the north, the head of the Kharkiv region said.

The Ukrainian army was able “to push the enemy back beyond its previous position,” Oleh Synehubov said on the messaging app Telegram. He called it a “shameful defeat.”

There was no information about casualties on either side.

After dark, Russian forces increased their shelling of the eastern city, Ukraine’s second largest. On Tuesday morning, Synehubov had said Russian troops the previous night had fired more than 60 missiles at the historical center of the city.

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate has unanimously approved a resolution seeking investigations of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his regime for war crimes over the invasion of Ukraine.

Senators late Tuesday passed the resolution, which says the Senate strongly condemns the “violence, war crimes. crimes against humanity” being carried out Russian military forces. The measure does not carry the force of law, but encourages international criminal court investigations of Putin, his security council and military leaders.

“These atrocities deserve to be investigated for war crimes,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.

LVIV — A funeral service was held Tuesday in Lviv for four Ukrainian soldiers killed in a Russian attack on a training base in Yavoriv in western Ukraine. The attack on Sunday killed at least 35 people.

Ukrainian soldiers shouldered the caskets into the sanctuary of Church of the Most Holy Apostles Peter and Paul and placed them on bases.

Burials were held Tuesday for three soldiers, Oleg Yaschyshyn, Serhiy Melnyk and Rostyslav Romanchuk.

The fourth soldier, Kyrylo Vyshyvanyi, was previously buried in his hometown of Duliby in the Lviv region. Vyshyvanyi’s family buried his younger brother, Vasyl, on March 4.

KYIV, Ukraine — A top Ukrainian negotiator says talks with Russia will continue Wednesday.

Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who spoke to Russian negotiators via video link on Monday and Tuesday, described the talks as “very difficult and sticky.”

He said that “there are fundamental contradictions,” but added that “there is certainly room for compromise.”

The talks via video link this week follow three round of negotiations in Belarus that have failed to produce any visible progress.

Both Russian and Ukrainian negotiators have voiced cautious optimism but haven’t spelled out any details of talks.

KYIV, Ukraine — A senior Ukrainian official says about 20,000 people have managed to leave the besieged port city of Mariupol.

Kyrylo Tymoshenko, a deputy head of office of Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the evacuees left Mariupol in private vehicles via a humanitarian corridor on Tuesday.

He said that 570 of some 4,000 vehicles that left the city have reached the city of Zaporizhzhia some 260 kilometers (160 miles) northwest while others will spend the night in various towns along the way.

Mariupol, a strategic port city of 430,000 on the Sea of Azov, has been besieged by Russian troops for more than 10 days, facing heavy shelling that has killed more than 2,300 people and left residents struggling for food, water, heat and medicine.

WASHINGTON — Russian ground troops have made limited progress over the last 24 hours in their effort to seize major cities in Ukraine, a senior defense official said Tuesday.

And as deadly airstrikes continue, the U.S. has seen indications that Russia may believe it needs more troops and supplies than it has on hand in the country, and is considering ways to get resources brought in, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss U.S. military assessments.

The official did not elaborate on the indications, and said that as of Tuesday, however, there has been no actual movement of reinforcement troops currently in Russia going into Ukraine.

According to the official, Russian ground forces are still about 15-20 kilometers (9-12 miles) northwest of Kyiv and 20-30 kilometers (12-19 miles) east of the city, which is being increasingly hit by long-range strikes. The official said Ukrainian troops continue to put up stiff resistance in Kharkiv and other areas.

Russia has launched more than 950 missiles so far in the war, and both Russia and Ukraine still retain about 90% of their combat power, the official said.

MEDYKA, Poland — Refugees continued to pour into Poland on Tuesday at a border crossing connecting Ukraine to the Polish village of Medyka.

Ludmila Deslichenko, 41, traveled from Cherkasy in central Ukraine.

“We would like to go back home as soon as the war ends and when there’s peace,” Deslichenko said. “It was very terrifying. There were bombs during the day, also rockets, everywhere in Ukraine. There were a lot of explosions. As soon as it calms down and the war is over, we will go back.”

Oksana Voloshen, 59, said she crossed the border to buy groceries to bring back to Mostyska in far western Ukraine.

“We have nothing in the shops,” she said.

Nicolas Kusiak, who leads NGOs and volunteers at the Medyka border crossing, said that while they’re seeing mostly refugees entering Poland, some are headed the other way.

“We have a lot of military, ex-military from all over the world, the (United) States, U.K., Germany, Denmark, even Poland, joining the international legion,” Kusiak said.

KYIV, Ukraine — A senior aide to Ukraine’s president says that Russia has softened its stance in the talks over a possible settlement.

Ihor Zhovkva, a deputy chief of staff to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said Tuesday that the talks between Russian and Ukrainian representatives have become “more constructive” and Russia has changed tone and stopped airing demands for Ukraine to surrender — something Russia had insisted upon during earlier stages of talks.

Three rounds of talks in Belarus earlier this month have been followed by video calls between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators, including the one on Tuesday.

Zhovkva said that Ukrainian representatives feel “moderately optimistic” after the talks, adding that it would be necessary for Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet to make major progress.

ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey’s foreign minister is traveling to Moscow as part of efforts to secure a cease-fire.

Mevlut Cavusoglu would hold talks in Moscow on Wednesday before traveling to Ukraine for talks on Thursday, Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Tuesday.

In a televised address following a Cabinet meeting, Erdogan also said the Polish President Andrzej Duda would be visiting Turkey on Wednesday for talks expected to focus on the crisis.

Last week the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers met on the sidelines of a diplomacy forum organized by Turkey, although their talks failed to produce a breakthrough.

BRATISLAVA, Slovakia — Slovakia’s Parliament has approved a NATO plan to deploy up to 2,100 troops on Slovak territory following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The plan is part of the NATO initiative to reassure member countries on the alliance’s eastern flank by sending forces to help protect them.

Germany is supposed to contribute the biggest number of soldiers, up to 700, to the multinational battlegroup. The Czech Republic follows with 600 and the U.S. will send up to 400. The Netherlands, Poland and Slovenia will also contribute troops.

Their deployment together with the Patriot air defense system will increase the defensive capabilities of Slovakia’s armed forces.

The alliance stationed troops in the Baltic countries — Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — and Poland after the 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula by Russia. After Russia attacked Ukraine, NATO decided to boost its presence along the entire eastern flank by deploying forces in Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia.

MILAN — Italian museums said Tuesday that they had gotten a reprieve from a Russian request to immediately repatriate artworks on loan from the State Hermitage Museum of St. Petersburg.

The director of the State Hermitage Museum of St. Petersburg said in a message relayed Monday by the Hermitage Italia collection that an agreement had been reached with Russian cultural officials so that “the paintings of Titian and Picasso can continue to remain on the walls of museums,” at Palazzo Reale in Milan and the Fondazione Alda Fendi in Rome. The same goes for works on loan to the Gallerie d’Italia, owned by bank Intesa Sanpaolo, in Milan.

Russian cultural officials had requested the immediate repatriation of the works last week as cultural ties frayed along with the diplomatic tensions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The Hermitage director general, Michail Piotrovsky, expressed regret “that cultural relations between our countries have collapsed into such ‘darkness.’ It can recover only if we conserve an atmosphere of good will and benevolence. We always repeat that the bridges of culture are the last to blow up. It is time to protect them.”

BRUSSELS — NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg says he’s convened a summit for next week of the military organization’s 30 leaders to discuss Russia’s war on Ukraine.

Stoltenberg says the March 24 summit will be led by U.S. President Joe Biden and “will address the consequences of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, our strong support for Ukraine, and further strengthening NATO’s deterrence and defense in response to a new reality for our security.”

White House press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed that Biden will travel to Brussels for the face-to-face talks with European leaders.

The trip follows on Vice President Kamala Harris’ visit to eastern flank NATO countries of Poland and Romania last week to discuss with leaders the growing refugee crisis in eastern Europe sparked by the Russian invasion and to underscore the Biden administration’s support for NATO allies.

Stoltenberg said in a statement Tuesday that “at this critical time, North America and Europe must continue to stand together in NATO.” NATO has been bolstering its eastern flank with troops and equipment to deter Russia from invading any of its members. NATO refuses to deploy troops to Ukraine as it is concerned about sparking a wider war in Europe.

BRUSSELS — The European Union has slapped sanctions on Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich as part of a new package of measures targeting Russia.

The EU included the Russian oligarch in its updated list of individuals facing assets freeze and travel bans over their role in the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The 55-year-old Abramovich had already been punished in Britain by Boris Johnson’s administration last week. The aluminum magnate was among seven wealthy Russians who had their assets frozen under British sanctions in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Abramovich has also been suspended as director of the Premier League club.

The EU said Abramovich “has had privileged access to the president, and has maintained very good relations with him. This connection with the Russian leader helped him to maintain his considerable wealth.”

The Russian Foreign Ministry says Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly, Defense Minister Anita Anand and other Canadian officials have been put on a sanctions list.

The ministry said in Tuesday’s statement that they have been barred from entering Russia in retaliation to Canadian sanctions against the Russian leadership. The Russian sanctions also targeted Canadian lawmakers.

The ministry said the decision was a forced move taken in response to “hostile actions by the current Canadian regime that has long tested our patience.” The decision followed the announcement of Russian sanctions against U.S. President Joe Biden and senior members of his administration.

The Russian Foreign Ministry says Moscow is withdrawing from the Council of Europe.

The ministry said it handed a formal notice about Russia’s decision to leave the continent’s leading human rights organization to the Council of Europe’s Secretary General Marija Pejčinović Burić on Tuesday.

It said the move followed the Council of Europe’s decision to suspend Russia’s membership that was taken on Feb. 25.

The ministry charged that the Council of Europe has become an instrument of exerting pressure on Russia and alleged that it has been heavily influenced by NATO and the European Union. It said in a statement that its withdrawal from the Council of Europe wouldn’t impact human rights and freedoms in the country, which officials said are safeguarded by the Russian constitution.

Russia’s invasion has sparked widespread allegations of war crimes, as hundreds of Ukrainian civilians have been killed and numerous residential areas have been targeted by Russian troops.

The Kremlin says that President Vladimir Putin has discussed the situation in Ukraine with European Council President Charles Michel.

The Kremlin said in a statement that Putin informed Michel about the Russian view of the talks with Ukraine in Tuesday’s call, adding that Ukrainian officials haven’t yet “demonstrated a serious intention to search for mutually acceptable solutions.”

Michel said on Twitter that he told Putin about the “urgent need to stop Russia’s fratricidal war against Ukraine” and emphasized that “indiscriminate shelling by Russian forces of Ukraine civilians must stop.” He added that “Russia must urgently enable humanitarian access and safe passage.

WARSAW — During a news conference with foreign journalists on Monday in Warsaw, Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski said that while solidarity for Ukrainian refugees remains strong, steps must be taken to avoid a backlash.

More than 1.8 million refugees have fled to Poland. Around 390,000 people have traveled to Warsaw, where 300,000 displaced Ukrainians remain. Warsaw has become a major transfer point for Ukrainian refugees fleeing the Russian invasion. Its central train station has become a hub for people awaiting transport further West.

“I need to take care of the normal functioning of the city, because the more problems we have, the more our attention is diverted to other issues for longer, then we will start having problems in schools and hospitals and elsewhere,” he told reporters.

BELGRADE, Serbia — Another flight from Belgrade to Moscow has received a bomb threat that turned out to be false, Serbia’s police said Tuesday.

Unlike two other threats since Friday, this time it came before the plane took off. On Friday and Monday, the aircraft had to turn back shortly after takeoff for inspection.

The police said Tuesday they are investigating the third false claim in five days.

Serbian state media say the threatening emails came from Ukraine.

Besides Turkish carriers, Serbia’s national airline AirSerbia is the only airline in Europe still flying to and from Russia.

Serbia, which formally seeks European Union membership but has maintained close relations with ally Russia, has refused to join an international flight ban against Moscow in response to the war in Ukraine.

UNITED NATIONS — Russia has circulated a proposed U.N. Security Council resolution demanding protection for civilians “in vulnerable situations” in Ukraine and safe passage for humanitarian aid and people seeking to leave the country — but it makes no mention of Russia’s responsibility for the war against its smaller neighbor.

The draft resolution released Tuesday expresses “grave concern” at the deteriorating humanitarian situation and reports of civilian casualties in and around Ukraine. It endorses U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ call for dialogue and negotiations and calls for a negotiated cease-fire to rapidly evacuate “all civilians,” and underscores “the need for the parties concerned to agree on humanitarian pauses to this end.”

The draft, which never identifies “the parties concerned,” could be put to a vote as early as Wednesday, according to a Russian diplomat who was not authorized to speak publicly because discussions have been private.

The Russian measure was circulated a day after France and Mexico announced that a humanitarian resolution on Ukraine they co-sponsored, which had been discussed for two weeks in the Security Council, was being moved to the 193-member General Assembly for discussion and a vote.

That draft resolution called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and deplored the dire humanitarian consequences of the hostilities in Ukraine, provisions which are not in the proposed Russian resolution. The France-Mexico resolution would almost certainly have led to a Russian veto in the Security Council, but there are no vetoes in the General Assembly.

Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told reporters that his country is prepared to support a humanitarian resolution and after Monday’s announcement by the French and Mexican ambassadors Russia thinks “the chances are still there,” so he was putting forward its “roadmap” and will see whether the council adopts it.

TORONTO — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asked Canadians to imagine bombs landing in their communities as he told the Canadian Parliament that his people want to live.

Zelenskyy urged Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Canadian lawmakers to help enact a no-fly zone over the Ukraine and called for greater economic pressure on Russia.

“Justin, can you imagine you and your children hearing all these severe explosions, the bombing of the airport, the bombing of the Ottawa airport,” Zelenskyy said. “Cruise missiles are falling down and your children are asking you, ‘What happened?’”

Speaking by video from Ukraine to a packed Canadian House of Commons chamber, Zelenskyy said the Russian war is designed to annihilate Ukraine and subjugate its people.

Zelenskyy evoked British wartime leader Winston Churchill as he told the U.K. Parliament last week that his country would fight Russia’s invasion to the end. Zelenskyy will also speak Wednesday to members of the U.S. House and Senate, an event that will be livestreamed for the public.

MYKOLAIV, Ukraine — In Mykolaiv, a southern Ukraine city bordering the Black Sea, walls of sandbags with mannequins for decoys are placed at checkpoints. A high sandbag wall protects the front of a building serving as a support center for the military.

Rodyin Lavrushin is a volunteer at the center. He lifted a tarp covering plastic crates filled with Molotov cocktails.

“Here we collect everything from food to clothes and military specifics and help our military because the Russian occupiers came here to our home and we will protect it to the end.” Lavrushin said Monday.

Mykolaiv resident Svetlana Gryshchenko said her son was killed Feb. 26 in the Donetsk region.

“He went there to the military command,” Gryshchenko said. “He was a soldier and he’d just turned 24. He went there to work (with the military), not to fight.”

“What is happening now in Mykolaiv cannot be described through words,” Gryshchenko said. “We are bombed during the day and during the night. We are peaceful citizens, and I cannot put it into words. It is impossible to put into words. It’s a nightmare what Russia is doing on the territory of Ukraine.”

Outside the Mykolaiv city morgue, bodies placed in plastic bags lie on the ground because the building had no room for more of the dead.

NEW YORK — Fox News says one of its video journalists was killed in Ukraine when the vehicle he was traveling in was struck by incoming fire.

The network said Tuesday that videographer Pierre Zakrzewski was killed in an incident that also injured reporter Benjamin Hall, who remains hospitalized. Their injuries occurred Monday in Horenka, outside of Kyiv.

Zakrzewski was a veteran journalists who had covered conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria for Fox. Suzanne Scott, CEO of Fox News Media, said in a memo to staff members on Tuesday that “his passion and talent as a journalist were unmatched.”

He won an internal award at Fox for helping to get freelancers and their families out of Afghanistan after the U.S. withdrawal last year.

He was the second journalist killed in Ukraine in two days, following the death of documentary filmmaker Brent Renaud.

Intense bombardments and fighting continue in multiple cities across the frontline, particularly in Mariupol where sustained Russian attacks and dwindling supplies undermine the defence. This morning, 14 March, an apartment block in the Obolon district of northern Kyiv was shelled, leaving at least two dead, while air strikes in Sumy, Chernihiv and Mykolaiv have left numerous further civilians dead. Notably, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov today accused the US and EU of “provoking” Russia into storming Ukrainian cities. According to Peskov, President Vladimir Putin has given orders to hold back on an immediate assault on large cities “because the civilian losses would be large”, though he did state that the Kremlin hasn’t ruled out taking Ukrainian cities under its “full control”.

This morning, 14 March, an apartment block in the Obolon district of northern Kyiv was shelled, leaving at least two dead, while air strikes in Sumy, Chernihiv and Mykolaiv have left numerous further civilians dead. Notably, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov today accused the US and EU of “provoking” Russia into storming Ukrainian cities. According to Peskov, President Vladimir Putin has given orders to hold back on an immediate assault on large cities “because the civilian losses would be large”, though he did state that the Kremlin hasn’t ruled out taking Ukrainian cities under its “full control”. This comes as Russian forces continue to tighten their perimeter and concentrate a significant amount of combat power around Kyiv. While it remains to be seen whether a frontal assault on Kyiv will occur in the coming days, the Kremlin’s statements reinforce our assessment that Russian forces will want to avoid protracted urban fighting if possible. In a direct assault, the Russians would face extremely high casualties, particularly after the defenders have had almost three weeks to prepare the city’s defences. Instead, other reports continue to indicate that Russian forces are purposefully targeting critical food and water sources in key cities, with an air raid destroying a water pump at the Chernihivvodokanal pumping station, which provides water to the city of Chernihiv. As such, it remains highly likely that Russian forces will continue to cut off supplies to Kyiv and other cities to avoid unnecessary military casualties on their part, while tightening the perimeter to the north, west, east and increasingly south. The siege of Mariupol will likely prove the most important precedent in this respect, though Russian forces will likely be more reticent to bombard Kyiv to the same intensity given the city’s symbolic status and potential seat of a puppet pro-Russian regime.

Ukraine’s national energy company, Ukrenergo, stated on 14 March that the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear power plant had once again lost power. Russian forces have reportedly damaged a high-voltage power line for the second time, coming only days after power was restored after the first incident. There is currently around 20 tons of nuclear waste which must be constantly cooled to prevent the release of radiation from the plant, which sustained disruptions to power supplies will put at risk. The plant is reportedly relying on back-up diesel generators. Ukrainian officials last week alleged that Russian forces could stage a false-flag incident at the Chernobyl nuclear plant.

According to sources cited in a Wall Street Journal article published on 13 March, Russian prosecutors have issued warnings to numerous prominent Western multinationals in Russia, threatening asset seizures and arrests of officials of firms looking to withdraw from the country. While the Russian Embassy in the US has denied these claims, Russian authorities have reportedly issued the warnings via letters, calls and in-person visits to companies including Coca-Cola Co., McDonald’s Corp., Procter & Gamble Co., International Business Machines Corp. and Yum Brands Inc. Specifically, they reportedly threatened to arrest officials who have criticised the government as well as threatened to seize company assets, including intellectual property. These reports reinforce earlier assessments that the business environment for Western firms will continue to deteriorate, with de facto nationalisations increasingly likely for firms that have taken a stand opposing the war in Ukraine and moved to cease their Russian operations. The warnings of arrest underline in particular the mounting threats of arbitrary detention and legal action against executives, with the FSB likely conducting investigations into these firms, with corresponding attempts to intercept corporate communications and those between staff members.

However, indirect pressure is also mounting on multinationals operating in Russia from the Ukrainian government. Today, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called for a global boycott of international companies that have kept their operations in Russia. This is the latest development in a materialising “name and shame” campaign we first identified as a key indicator last week (see our attached Tripwires and Triggers report), and while Kuleba has not yet named any specific company, it is likely Kyiv will do so in the coming days as it clearly intends to orchestrate a global boycott campaign. This underscores the mounting reputational risk for firms retaining operations inside Russia, with the Ukrainian government likely to utilise its considerable media and social media influence to encourage pro-Ukrainian activist groups to organise boycott campaigns in key international markets. Looking ahead, this will also increase the risk of physical activism targeting headquarters and sites of boycotted firms in Europe and North America in particular.

In line with Russia’s growing offensive against social media platforms and efforts to establish control over the information landscape, Instagram was blocked on 14 March. The move to restrict Instagram follows its parent company, Meta’s, decision last week to allow users to post messages calling for violence against Russians and the death of President Vladimir Putin. Instagram is one of the most popular platforms amongst young Russians and its designation as a “restricted” resource – along with the blocking of Facebook and Twitter – will further limit the available information regarding the war in Ukraine. More broadly, as Putin has failed to achieve a quick victory in Ukraine and the number of casualties continues to grow, the clampdown on social media will only intensify, with information sharing platforms in general having become somewhat of a battleground between pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian accounts. The Kremlin will also continue deploying Russian speaking social media influencers to spread its narrative and justify the invasion. Additionally, as the war evolves, so will the Kremlin’s methods to spread false information and spin the narrative in its favour for the domestic audience.

On 14 March, Reuters cited numerous unnamed officials in the Indian government that New Delhi is considering taking up a Russian offer for discounted oil and other key export commodities. According to the officials, such an arrangement would be paid for through a proposed ruble-rupee trade mechanism. India currently imports over 80% of its oil and derived products, but only 2-3% is sourced from Russia. However, cheap Russian oil exports will likely prove an attractive alternative for New Delhi amid rising oil and related commodity prices and an inflation rate now over 13%. New Delhi was notably already considering increasing Russian oil imports prior to the invasion in order to diversify its supply and reduce dependency upon Middle Eastern exporters. Furthermore, Indian state-owned firms retain stakes in numerous Russian oilfields and joint ventures in the sector. As such, the signing of new import contracts may also serve to protect these joint ventures in the face of mounting international sanctions and reduce costs, as India faces an increase of USD 50 billion in its import bill for the 2022-23 financial year. Nevertheless, such contracts would take time to implement if New Delhi agrees, providing limited scope for the Indian market to make up significant shortfalls in Russian revenues in the short term, as Russia continues to struggle to find buyers for its commodities.

In related developments, US officials claimed on 13 March that Russia has asked China for weapons and financial aid. Both Chinese and Russian authorities have denied the claims, and while the US has provided no details as to the exact form of the request, it is likely aimed at mitigating shortages of key munitions, components and spare parts. The abrupt withdrawal of Western firms from Russia has severely disrupted Russian supply chains, including military ones, and as the war extends into its third week the Russian armed forces will likely be running low on some equipment and munitions. Washington has indicated its growing concern over China’s potential role in the current conflict, with financial or military aid likely to undermine Western sanction efforts. Nevertheless, overt financial or military assistance would risk international economic penalties on Chinese firms and significantly worsen Beijing’s already tense trading relations with the US. As such, it remains unclear whether Beijing will agree to Russia’s request considering it is unlikely to want to prolong a conflict which is having such a negative impact on international energy and commodity stability.

The Wagner Group is reported t be recruiting mercenaries in the Donbas region whilst Syria and other Middle East countries are supplying 16000 soldiers. Russia has already used 4000 conscripts although mass mobilisation is not expected.

whilst Syria and other Middle East countries are supplying 16000 soldiers. Russia has already used 4000 conscripts although mass mobilisation is not expected. Russia has stalled its advances whilst it reorganises its Command And Control systems to lessen losses. Vehicle losses have fallen with helicopters escorting convoys. No country has deployed 200,000 troops since 1945 so there are lessons being learnt as the Russians advance; 45,000 body bags were prepared prior to the invasion so heavy casualties were expected. Mobile crematoria have also been seen. Reports sugest that Russian troops in the Donbas region are using their cmmms systems according to tactics, thus they don’t need to keep the 4G airwaves open for open comms using mobile phones.

Russia’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) claims to have destroyed a military airfield in Vasylkiv, southwest of Kyiv, using high-precision weapons on 12 March. The location is Ukraine’s main centre for signals intelligence in the city of Brovary, east of the capital. Claims have not yet been independently verified, though videos released on social media platforms purportedly show a plume of smoke over the military airfield. It must be noted that despite Russian sources reporting their use of precision weaponry, the British MoD reports that Russian tactical aircraft supporting the advance of ground troops are primarily relying on unguided “dumb” munitions. These weapons are relatively indiscriminate, thereby increasing the likelihood of civilian casualties, particularly in densely populated urban areas.

On 12 March, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov stated that Moscow has warned the US that it could target Western arms shipments to Ukraine. During the press conference, Ryabkov said “that pumping weapons from a number of countries it orchestrates isn’t just a dangerous move, it’s an action that makes those convoys legitimate targets”. This aligns with previous assessments that Russia is unlikely to continue tolerating the shipments of critical military equipment, including MANPADS and anti-tank weaponry, without some sort of response, particularly as Ukrainian resistance continues to stall Russia’s offensives. Preventing these shipments will be a key medium-term goal of the Kremlin in order to prevent, or mitigate the potential for, the current war descending into a protracted insurgency supported by Western arms supplies. Ryabkov did not clarify whether the “legitimate targets” would apply to convoys that had crossed the border into Ukraine or also those convoys that had yet to cross the border. At this stage it remains most likely that Russian forces would target known convoys only once they are inside Ukraine, given the escalatory nature of any attack in a NATO country, even if perceived as a legitimate military target. Nevertheless, that remains a potential point of escalation in the coming weeks and months if Western countries do not cease supplying arms to Ukraine, but further warnings would likely pre-empt such an attack given Russia’s desire to avoid an unnecessary escalation.

On 12 March the head of the Russian space agency Dmitry Rogozin warned that sanctions against Russia could lead to the International Space Station (ISS) to crash. He called for sanctions to be lifted because they could disrupt the operations of Russian spacecraft servicing the ISS. Given that the Russian section of the station helps correct its ISS’s orbit, Rogozin has warned that this could cause the structure to fall into the sea or land. NASA have previously stated that they are working on a solution to maintain the ISS’s orbit without Russian assistance, but Rogozin’s comments are likely designed to remind the international community of the further escalatory levers available to Moscow that could disrupt the space sector.

Following strikes on Belarusian villages across the border with Ukraine by Russian forces on 11 March, Ukrainian officials claim that an attack by Belarusian forces is imminent. On 12 March, the Belarusian government announced that it is sending five battalion tactical groups to replace the ones deployed at the Ukrainian borders. However, the Lukashenka government continues to state that it does not plan to join the Russian invasion of Ukraine, though Russian pressure is likely mounting on Minsk to more openly support offensive operations.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reported that Russian forces have kidnapped the mayor of the south-eastern city of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov. On 11 March, officials released video footage of what appears to be armed soldiers escorting Fedorov out of a building in the city centre, though the identity of the individual cannot be verified from the video. The alleged abduction comes days after Fedorov publicly refused to cooperate with occupying Russian forces, claiming they had ransacked government offices and exiled his team. In response, hundreds of residents have gathered outside district administrative buildings demanding that Russian forces release the mayor. The protests themselves do not represent a novel development, as Melitopol residents have conducted demonstrations every day since Russian forces captured the city on 26 February. However, Zelensky claims that the abduction marks a “new stage of terror” in the invasion, with Russian forces looking to “physically eliminate representatives of legitimate local Ukrainian authorities” in a bid to suppress organised resistance to occupation. However, strong opposition among residents will elevate the risk of violent clashes between Ukrainian civilians and Russian forces, who are likely to seek to quell dissent and crush popular opposition among residents.

Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, announced that regular humanitarian corridors will open today, 12 March, from 0900 (local time), 0700 GMT, to facilitate civilian evacuation and humanitarian aid shipments. In particular, an aid and bus convoy will depart from Zaporizhzhia to the city of Mariupol via Vasylivka, Melitopol, Berdyansk and Manhush. There is also a corridor between the town of Pology, Zaporizhzhia region, in the direction of Zaporizhzhia, passing Tokmak, Vasylivka and Kamianske. A number of routes will also be operating in the Kyiv and Sumy regions. However, Russian shelling and possible clashes with Ukrainian forces are likely to generate disruptions to routes throughout the day, delaying civilians evacuations and aid deliveries, as indicated by reports over the past week.

On 12 March the Deputy of Kherson Regional Council Serhiy Khlan alleged that Russian occupying forces are preparing to stage a referendum in Kherson oblast with the aim of proclaiming the region the KhNR. Russia has utilised similar referenda in the past, most notably in occupied-Crimea, but this latest development aligns with similar unconfirmed reports last week that pro-Russian citizens in Ivano-Frankivsk oblast had been planning to declare a separatist republic in Western Ukraine. This may indicate Russian plans to effectively dismember a unitary Ukraine into a federation made up of separate oblasts. InformNapalm yesterday, 11 March, published unverified reports allegedly outlining plans for how Russia intends to control Ukraine during and after the war that had allegedly been circulated among high-ranking officials and military personnel. The report included the option of holding referenda (organised by local self-government bodies) on the secession of respective regions from Ukraine as a means of controlling the country. It should be stated that this report remains unconfirmed, but the statement of the Kherson official today would align with this. If such a referendum is held, which remains very plausible given precedents in Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk, this would strongly suggest this is what the Russians plan in other oblasts across the country, with the likely ultimate aim of disempowering the unitary government in Kyiv.

FORECAST

A new round of talks between Ukraine and Russia commenced today, 14 March. Despite the Ukrainian side continuing to demand an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian troops, this latest round of discussions is taking place following a deadly air strike on a residential building in Kyiv and Russia’s allegations that a shot-down Ukrainian missile killed over a dozen civilians in Donetsk. As such, the prospects of today’s negotiations achieving a breakthrough are minimal. Nevertheless, the economic impact of the sanctions is already being felt across Russian society and Putin’s inability to secure a quick victory in Ukraine may be one of the reasons for Moscow’s reported appeal to China for military aid – though the Kremlin has denied this. Meanwhile, the investment climate in Russia will continue to deteriorate, with reports of Russian authorities threatening to arrest officials who have criticised the government and threatening to seize assets from companies that have taken an anti-Russia stance set to only increase in the weeks ahead.

Regarding evacuation and safe passage out of Kyiv and into western Ukraine, as of 14 March, the southbound H01 remains a comparatively safer route for access to/exit from Kyiv, then connecting with westbound roads such as the P32 through Bila Tserkva. Russian forces bombarded the Vasylkiv airport on 12 March, highlighting the elevated security risks posed by airstrikes on routes southwest and south of Kyiv as Russian ground troops continue to face challenges encircling the capital. For evacuation from Kyiv, therefore, the window for safe departure is increasingly limited. Russian armour and infantry units continue to be dispersed around the forests north and south of the E40, and as such, this route remains unsafe. It is likely that Russian mechanised forces will continue pushing south towards Fastiv to establish full control over the P04 route as well. As such, Byshev Airport on the westbound P04 remains a likely target for the Russian push to encircle Kyiv. No fighting in the airport’s premises has been observed as of this Alert’s publication, but we consider this to be a likely target for Russian forces. In comparative terms, therefore, the H01/P01 remains the safest route out of the city, although any travel is undertaken at one’s own risk as all approaches to Kyiv are vulnerable to shelling or missile strikes.

SOCMINT indicates ad-hoc checkpoints and stop-and-search checks by Ukrainian rear echelon units continue to take place on the P02, P69, M07 circular and H01/P01 in Kyiv. These are likely conducted in order to identify potential Russian fifth columnists/saboteurs, and Ukrainian units conducting these checks are believed to be operating on capture/kill orders. As such those seeking to leave/enter Kyiv should treat such checks with due caution.

Russia: Corporate flight likely to persist despite threats of arrests and seizures to foreign entities

On 13 March, local sources cited by international media claimed that Russian prosecutors have issued warnings to several foreign entities which have suspended in-country operations, such as Coca-Cola, McDonald’s and Procter & Gamble. Allegedly Russian authorities have made threats to arrest officials who have criticised the government or to seize company assets, including intellectual property. The warnings have reportedly driven at least one of the targeted companies to limit communications between its Russian business and the rest of the firm, amid concerns that the Russian government could intercept colleagues’ text messages and emails. Such intimidation tactics and threats underscore the continuous decline of the country’s business environment, likely to persist in the coming weeks despite Moscow’s efforts to dissuade further corporate and capital flight to mitigate the economic impact of broad international sanctions.

President Biden Signs New Russia-Related Executive Order Prohibiting Certain Imports, Exports, and New Investment

In coordination with Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom as well as the European Union leaders, President Biden has signed a new Russia-related Executive Order Prohibiting Certain Imports, Exports, and New Investment with Respect to Continued Russian Federation Aggression. Specifically, this E.O. prohibits:

The importation into the United States of the following products of Russian Federation origin: fish, seafood, and preparations thereof; alcoholic beverages; non-industrial diamonds; and any other products of Russian Federation origin as may be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Commerce;

The exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply, directly or indirectly, from the United States, or by a United States person, wherever located, of luxury goods, and any other items as may be determined by the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury, to any person located in the Russian Federation;

New investment in any sector of the Russian Federation economy as may be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, by a United States person, wherever located;

The exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply, directly or indirectly, from the United States, or by a United States person, wherever located, of U.S. dollar-denominated banknotes to the Government of the Russian Federation or any person located in the Russian Federation; and

Any approval, financing, facilitation, or guarantee by a United States person, wherever located, of a transaction by a foreign person where the transaction by that foreign person would be prohibited by this section if performed by a United States person or within the United States.

* BIS Restricts the Export of Luxury Goods to Russia and Belarus and to Russian and Belarusian Oligarchs and Malign Actors in Latest Response to Aggression Against Ukraine. In response to President Biden’s latest Russia-related Executive Order reported in Item 1 above, the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) has imposed restrictions on the export, reexport, and transfer (in country) of luxury goods to all end users in the Russian Federation (Russia) and Belarus and to certain Russian and Belarusian oligarchs and malign actors located worldwide. This rule significant restrictions on persons and organizations within Russia and Belarus that have the financial resources to purchase U.S.-origin luxury goods. Additionally, this rule imposes additional costs on certain Russian and Belarusian oligarchs and malign actors (regardless of their location) who have been designated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury as Specially Designated Nationals in connection with their support for the Russian government. It provides a list of U.S.-origin luxury goods that are impacted by today’s sanctions and includes certain spirits, tobacco products, clothing items, jewelry, vehicles, and antique goods. Click here for the Federal Register notice on this rule scheduled to be published on March 16. This rule is effective, however, as of March 11.

*OFAC Implements New Executive Order. To implement President Biden’s latest Russia-related Executive Order reported in Item 1 above, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has issued Russia-related General License 17, General License 18, and General License 19 and Ukraine-related General License 23. OFAC has also published new Frequently Asked Questions and amended one Frequently Asked Question. In addition, OFAC has issued a new round of sanctions targeting Russian and Kremlin elites, oligarchs, and Russia’s political and national security leaders who have supported Russian President Vladimir Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine. These actions include designating regime elites and business executives who are associates and facilitators of the Russian regime, including three immediate family members of President Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitriy Sergeevich Peskov; Russian tycoon and Kremlin insider Viktor Vekselberg; and the Management Board of the sanctioned VTB Bank. Additionally, OFAC designated 12 members of the Russian State Duma, including Vyacheslav Victorovich Volodin, who is also a permanent member of Russia’s Security Council. OFAC has also issued guidance, in line with a G7 leaders statement, to guard against potential attempts to use virtual currency to evade U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia. As a result of these actions, all property and interests in property of the individuals above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. All transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or blocked persons are prohibited unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt. These prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any blocked person and the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person. Click here for further identifying information on the designated individuals. See also U.S. Customs’ CSMS #51289159 with respect to OFAC’s General License No. 17.

*OFAC Targets Russian Individuals and Entities Supporting DPRK Weapons of Mass Destruction and Ballistic Missile Programs. The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has sanctioned two individuals and three entities for supporting the DPRK’s ongoing development of its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missile programs in violation of multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions (UNSCRs). The DPRK has conducted 11 ballistic missile launches since the beginning of the year, most recently on March 4, 2022 (EST). This action targets a group of foreign individuals and companies that aid a DPRK defense industry-related procurement agent in Russia; much of this activity also violates UN prohibitions with respect to the DPRK.

Flares in regional tensions and Russian invasion of Ukraine threaten the revival of the nuclear deal

EU officials have confirmed the suspension of nuclear deal talks with Iran and the other signatories, citing unresolved “external factors”. Russian requests have certainly complicated the process, however, other key sticking points also remain unresolved including Iran’s demand for guarantees that no US president can leave a future deal and disagreements over access to undeclared sites for the International Atomic Energy Agency. Amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, US-Russian tensions are almost certainly at the forefront of Moscow and Washington’s foreign policy concerns, overtaking nuclear deal developments. As such, despite its commitment to preventing Iran from becoming a nuclear-armed state, Russia could increasingly exploit nuclear talks and warming relations with Iran as leverage against Western powers if military advances in Ukraine stall. As such, the Kremlin may be somewhat willing to overlook certain Iranian actions, bolstering hardline Iranian forces and their targeting of US-linked targets across the Middle East and Gulf. At the same time, Iranian frustration is growing as talks stall once again. Despite hardline rhetoric from Tehran, the government’s urgency for sanctions relief is deepening as domestic unrest grows following the winter period. Notably, protests in Iran are increasingly triggered by more diverse issues, though water insecurity and mismanagement are common drivers. As anti-government sentiment spreads, including in typically conservative strongholds, Iranian security forces including the IRGC are likely to engage in more hostile activities abroad.

Iran-Iraq: Missile strike elevates renewed Israel-Iran tit-for-tat hostilities; heightening threats to military targets and regional travel

On 13 March, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards announced they had carried out a missile attack overnight on Erbil in Iraqi Kurdistan, claiming responsibility for the targeting of Israeli “strategic centres”. While this is not the first incident of this kind, with Iran targeting the same location in April 2021, the attack comes amid deteriorating relations with Moscow and Washington on the Iranian nuclear talks in Vienna, with Russia’s latest demands stalling an agreement. With the attack likely conducted in response to Israeli strikes which killed Iranian military personnel in Syria last week, the incident may prompt a broader return to tit-for-tat hostilities with Israel at a critical time for nuclear negotiations. This may drive further Iran-linked strikes on targets in the Kurdistan region, though with less frequency than those in Iraq in the coming months, elevating threats to overland travel and the targeting of military bases in the near term.

On 13 March, Iran struck US-linked targets in Erbil in the northern Kurdistan region of Iraq with a dozen ballistic missiles. Iranian state news sources published reports claiming that Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) missiles had struck Israeli ‘strategic centres’, though local authorities report that the attacks landed near the US consulate but did not cause any casualties or severe structural damage. The timing, location and purported target of the strikes is slightly unusual, and could instead be linked to Iraqi government formation negotiations as Iran-backed Shia groups struggle to maintain political influence following losses in October 2021 elections. Notably, Kurdish parties can play an important role in forming a governing majority, and Iran seeks to maintain its political influence via its proxy networks. Regardless of motive, Iranian insecurities regarding Iraq and the nuclear deal, the attack on US-linked targets and the subsequent claim of responsibility all raise the risk of further regional hostilities. Missile strikes elevate the risk of a return to tit-for-tat hostilities between Israel and Iran. The targeting of US-linked forces in Iraqi Kurdistan, by either by Iranian forces or Iran-linked militia in Iraq, is not unprecedented, however, there had been no major strikes in recent months before the 13 March attack. Iranian state media released a statement by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) claiming responsibility for the attacks in retaliation to Israeli airstrikes in Syria which killed two IRGC members on 7 March. Such tit-for-tat hostilities have occurred sporadically in recent years during bouts of elevated tensions; for instance, Israeli forces launched airstrikes on Iran-linked targets in northeast Damascus in April 2021, after Iranian missiles exploded near Israel’s Dimona nuclear reactor. The latest strikes moderately elevate the risk of a return to tit-for-tat attacks, though Israel is unlikely to engage in overtly escalatory responses to an attack beyond its borders. That said, the strikes come at a pivotal time in negotiations to revive the 2015 nuclear deal. Russian demands that its trade with Iran be shielded from Western sanctions following the invasion on Ukraine, and Washington’s rejection of such a request, will likely disrupt progress towards an agreement. This could prompt Iran to harden its stance in talks as it desperately seeks sanctions relief. Notably, if Iran undertakes further nuclear advancements to pressure the signatories of the deal to ease sanctions, Israel would be more inclined to act. Israel’s very public rejection of the nuclear agreement and concerns over Iranian nuclear developments has previously taken the form of attacks on Iran’s critical infrastructure, cyber warfare and attacks in the maritime sphere.

Forecast

The latest strikes on Erbil suggest that Iran will continue to target US-linked locations in Iraq in particular, especially if Iran fears a loss of influence in Iraq or in the event of further Israeli strikes in Syria, with the IRGC’s overt claim of responsibility a further indication of more brazen military action in countries such as Iraq and across the Gulf. Should this lead to a resurgence in tit-for-tat incidents, commercial shipping lanes in the region will remain vulnerable to low-level attacks and cyber attacks could target critical or government infrastructure. Any spill over of hostilities could also drive aerial threats to Saudi Arabia and the UAE from Iran-backed Houthi. Notably, negotiations between Iran and Saudi Arabia have significantly deteriorated in recent days despite the two states being scheduled to meet for the fifth round of diplomatic talks this week. Moreover, Iran’s hardline government will likely consider the UAE an acceptable target due to its deepening economic ties with Israel.

Mali: Wagner group presence threatens effectiveness of France’s aerial support

On 11 March, the commander of Operation Barkhane, General Laurent Michon, announced that France will provide aerial support to Malian troops following the withdrawal of its counter-insurgency mission. However, the country will only be offering support to areas where Russian fighters of the private military contract group Wagner are not operating. France announced its decision to withdraw from Mali last month, following elevated tensions after the junta postponed elections by five years and the Wagner group contactors arrived in the country. France’s refusal to operate in the areas where Wagner contractors are present, which is currently Timbuktu and areas in the Mopti region, will undermine the capacity of aerial support to maintain raid response capabilities. Furthermore, deteriorated relations between Malian and French forces will likely impede co-operation efforts, threatening the effectiveness of air strikes as France will rely on Malian forces to identify accurate targets and call in strikes.

Mozambique: Cyclone Gombe will prolong disruptions to business operations

On 11 March, Cyclone Gombe struck north-eastern Mozambique, killing at least 11 people and impacting an estimated 15,000 people in Nampula and Zambezia provinces. Strong winds of up to 200 kilometres per hour destroyed infrastructure and landfall blocked roads across both provinces. Although the winds have weakened, heavy rainfall is expected to last for several days, heightening threats of flooding in Mozambique’s low-lying areas. Flooding has already devastated crops across the provinces, with food insecurity and poverty elevating threats of domestic unrest. Furthermore, 37 energy stations have reportedly been impacted, elevating threats of further power outages hindering businesses operations and communications. Cyclone Gombe is likely to exacerbate damage and impede the repair of roads following Storm Ana in January, sustaining disruption to overland movement between both southern and northern Mozambique and Malawian supply chains reliant on the Quelimane port corridor.

Ethiopia: Summary execution underlines threats to ethnic Tigrayans and will undermine efforts to remove sanctions

On 13 March, the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission confirmed that Ethiopian military forces summarily executed 11 people, including burning one alive, on 3 March. The incident followed an ambush, likely by the Benishangul People’s Liberation Movement (BPLM) rebel group, on a convoy of Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam workers in Metekel, Benishangul-Gumuz region in which 20 soldiers, three civilians and 30 rebels were killed. Despite the likely involvement of the BPLM, authorities often accuse the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) of having coordinated rebel activity, sporadically elevating threats to ethnic Tigrayans following rebel activity across Ethiopia. As such, the following day soldiers targeted ethnic Tigrayans, eight of whom were pulled off a civilian bus to be executed. Despite government pledges to punish the perpetrators the incident is likely to undermine efforts to improve relations with western governments and remove sanctions, as rights abuses undermine government pledges to pursue peace.

14 Mar 22. The US has told allies that China signalled its willingness to provide military assistance to Russia to support its invasion of Ukraine, according to officials familiar with American diplomatic cables on the exchange. The cables, which were sent by the US state department to allies in Europe and Asia, did not say whether China had signalled that it would help Russia in the future or if it had already started providing military support. Nor did they say at which point in the conflict Beijing appeared open to offering the help. The Financial Times reported on Sunday that Russia had made the request for assistance at some point after the start of the now three-week invasion. The Russian offer and Chinese response have sounded alarm bells in the White House. US officials believe China is trying to help Russia while its top officials publicly call for a diplomatic solution to the war. The Chinese embassy in the US on Sunday said it had no knowledge of any Russian request or positive Chinese response to Moscow. Russia on Monday also denied making any request to China. A senior US defence official declined to say if China had provided military support after the Russian request, but said the Pentagon was watching the situation “very, very closely”. “If China does choose to materially support Russia in this war, there will likely be consequences for China,” the defence official said.

BATTLESPACE Comment: Sources suggest that Russia has asked for a variety of UAVs including sUAVs and the Chinese Phantom UAV, tactical radios and precision missiles. It is likely that China may baulk at supplying lethal weapons for fear of US reprisals.

14 Mar 22. The head of Russia’s National Guard has said that Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine is not going as quickly as the Kremlin had wanted, in the strongest public acknowledgement yet that the invasion is not going to plan. Viktor Zolotov blamed the slower-than-expected progress on what he said were far-right Ukrainian forces hiding behind civilians, an accusation repeatedly made by officials in Russia. If Vladimir Putin has the choice of a humiliating defeat, which could bring his regime’s survival into question, or further escalation he may well double down on his bloody war.

14 Mar 22. U.S. Strategy and the Real Lessons of the War in Ukraine: From Cooperation with Russia and China to Lasting Confrontation.

By Anthony H. Cordesman

Read Online: cs.is/3tOouA4

No one can yet predict just how much of a human tragedy the Russian invasion of Ukraine will create. What the U.S. and its strategic partners can predict, however, is that Russia will be a lasting threat as long as Putin or anyone like him remains in power. What is also equally clear is that while China may be less openly provocative and threatening, its competition with the United States presents a steadily growing threat, and China is moving from cooperation and civil competition to the possibility of a major military confrontation as well. If anything, President Xi has already proved that China can create a far more effective threat than Russia over the coming decade, and President Xi already controls a far a larger economy than President Putin.

China already sharply outspends Russia in building up its military forces. The International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) estimates that Russia officially spent only $62.2 bn in FY 2021, although this is a high estimate based on comparative purchasing power – and it could be as high as $178bn. Russia’s military spending is sharply limited by its weak economy, and it cannot credibly do anything in the face of continued sanctions that will allow it to compete with the IISS estimate of $754bn for the United States and over $300bn for NATO European countries.

The World Bank does estimate that Russia did partly recover from the breakup of the Former Soviet Union (FSU) from a gross national product (GNP) of only $667bn in 1998 to $1,416bn in 2020 (measured in constant 2015 dollars), but this compares to $19,435 bn for the U.S. in 2020 (14 times larger) and $13,886 for the European Union (9.8 times larger).

In contrast, the World Bank estimates that China has seen its GDP rise from $1,123bn in 1991 to $14,632bn in 2020 (measured in constant 2015 dollars) – a figure 13 times larger than in 1991. China has steadily increased its official figures for military spending for over two decades, alongside its expanding economy. It officially spent $207.3bn on its military in 2021 according to the IISS, and its purchasing power could already be as high as $332bn. Some estimates indicate that China could equal the U.S. by 2035-2040.

For all the talk of resuming the Cold War, the reality is radically different. The United States and its strategic partners now confront two superpowers – not just one – and powers that pose both a global as well as a regional challenge. A rising China is also becoming the most serious threat. It is becoming a serious nuclear power, it is modernizing its conventional forces far more quickly than Russia, and it is a growing technological rival to the U.S. and its partners. Its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) as well as its global trade and investment efforts are also a far more effective method to use its civil-economic power to win strategic influence.

Accordingly, the U.S. needs to do far more than simply react to the war in Ukraine and help to rebuild NATO. The challenge is global, and it will increase every year. The real lesson of the war in Ukraine is that the U.S. must now plan to work with its strategic partners indefinitely into the future and in ways that meet both authoritarian threats.

14 Mar 22. Chinese diplomats and prominent state media have repeated Russian disinformation reports about US-run biological laboratories in Ukraine, deepening tensions between Washington and Beijing ahead of a critical security meeting in Europe. Yang Jiechi, China’s top foreign policy official, and Jake Sullivan, US national security adviser, will meet in Rome on Monday, the first face-to-face meeting between senior China and US officials since Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered troops into Ukraine. The talks come against a backdrop of rising frustration in the west over China’s relationship with Russia and Beijing’s refusal to condemn the invasion. The Financial Times reported on Monday that Russia has asked China for military ​equipment to ​support its invasion of Ukraine, sparking concern in ​the White House that Beijing ​could undermine western efforts to help Ukrainian forces defend their country. However, China’s official rhetoric on the Ukraine conflict over the weekend concentrated on allegations that the US was using Ukraine to research dangerous pathogens and biological weapons.

11 Mar 22. Sensing a feeding frenzy, German arms makers jockey for position. German companies are jockeying for position as the government tees up massive investments meant to drastically improve the state of the armed forces. Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Feb. 27 proposal to ramp up defense expenditures by tens of billions of euros, spurred by Russia’s war on Ukraine, has defense officials in Berlin scrambling to identify spending opportunities that promise fast results, according to several company officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. So hasty is the process that a key official in the Defence Ministry’s acquisition office, Vice Adm. Carsten Stawitzki, signaled to company executives that certain acquisition rules could be outright circumvented in service of quick deliveries. Companies also were put on notice that they should drop outstanding procurement disputes on the docket with the ministry in order to partake in upcoming work.

“It’s all completely ad hoc at the moment,” said an industry official.

The nascent spending strategy appears to coalesce around three objectives, according to industry sources:

Clearing the maintenance backlog across the services to get hardware back to the force, even if it means cutting corners.

Increasing by 50% the volume of main weapon systems, which could mean more Puma infantry fighting vehicles, more K-130 corvettes and more Pegasus spy planes.

Finalizing only longer-term investments for which plans are already on the books. This category includes the Future Combat Air System, a next-generation aerial weapon led by Germany, France and Spain; the Main Ground Combat System, a pan-European tank project; and the Tornado replacement program, which could bring the F-35 jet to Germany in a dual-capable role under NATO’s nuclear sharing doctrine.

A spokesperson for the Defence Ministry did not return a request for comment on acquisition guidelines accompanying the proposed spending uptick. The prospect of more defense funding also puts the spotlight on Germany’s air and missile defense capabilities, moving companies to position themselves in a market where defense officials have unsuccessfully tried to move past the venerable Patriot system. Rheinmetall and MBDA Italy signed a memorandum of understanding this week aimed at finding “disruptive technologies and in the national and European defence funds domain” in air defense, per a joint statement. In that partnership, Rheinmetall bills itself as the air-defense and radar specialist, while MBDA would provide future interceptors. In the lower-tier segment, German officials are expected to fall back on a setup featuring the IRIS-T interceptor, as proposed by manufacturer Diehl in conjunction with Hensoldt and Rheinmetall in March 2021. The companies’ package of missiles, radars and launch vehicles is meant to intercept aircraft, combat helicopters and cruise missiles, a weapon mix similar to the Russian arsenal used in the invasion of Ukraine. The former government of Chancellor Angela Merkel quietly approved the export of IRIS-T firing units to Egypt, a controversial deal that became public only after Scholz assumed office. Now, one consideration for a speedier acquisition of an air defense shield is to route some elements not yet delivered to Cairo into Berlin’s stocks instead.

14 Mar 22. Russia Attacks Kiev with Kalashnikov Kamikaze Drones. Russian troops have used small kamikaze drones known as KUB in attacks on the Ukrainian capital this week. One of Russian drones was shot down in the Podil neighborhood in Kyiv on Saturday. The light Unmanned Aerial System shot down was a kind of kamikaze drone known as KUB. The small UAS is developed by Russia’s most famous gun manufacturer Kalashnikov subsidiary ZALA Aero. It is designed to have a maximum speed of about 80 miles per hour, an endurance of 30 minutes, and an explosive payload of 7 pounds against “remote ground targets.” Kalashnikov says the drone — which can have a dwell time up to six hours — is an extremely precise and very effective weapon, incredibly hard to fight by traditional air defense systems. After the launch, the drone can loiter in the air to detect a target and then attack it from the upper hemisphere, being able to perform a diving pass along the vertical trajectory. The drone, which was shot down over Kyiv, contained explosives (plastids) with metal balls to inflict maximum human damage. (Source: UAS VISION/Defence Blog)

14 Mar 22. Ukraine’s leader expressed tentative hope for ceasefire talks on Monday even as Russian forces continued to shell his country’s cities, leaving hundreds of thousands of civilians trapped in siege conditions. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, said his representatives were discussing a possible meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin, as negotiators noted some positive movement on issues of substance in recent days. A fourth round of talks began on Monday morning, covering “peace, ceasefire, immediate withdrawal of troops [and] security guarantees”, according to Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelensky. “Hard discussion,” he added in a tweet before the meeting via video link, warning that Russia still appeared to be under the “delusion that 19 days of violence against peaceful cities is the right strategy”.

14 Mar 22. Runaway Soviet-Era Drone Crashes in Croatia. A Soviet-era reconnaissance drone flying across Hungary from Ukraine has crashed near the Croatian capital of Zagreb, leaving a big hole in the ground, the Croatian government says. An explosion was heard near Lake Jarun in Zagreb at around 11pm on Thursday. Police said several vehicles had been damaged and two parachutes found.

The incident raises two questions:

Where did it come from ?

It seems that this was actually a Tupolev Tu-141 “Strizh” reconnaissance drone that must have severely malfunctioned and crossed over the entirety of Hungary or parts of neighboring countries and into Croatia from Ukraine. Flying direct from Ukraine’s border to Zagreb is nearly a 350-mile journey. It has been reported that Ukraine has been putting the high-speed, Soviet-era drones to work in recent days following Russia’s invasion of the country. Ukraine is the only known current operator of the Tu-141.

The Tu-141 is a fascinating piece of Soviet-era hardware that Ukraine has upgraded and made useful following the invasion of Crimea in 2014. More of a cruise missile than a traditional drone, the aircraft is rocket-launched from its trailer and flies a predetermined course at transonic speed, collecting various forms of intelligence, before recovering via parachute. It can then be reset and used again.

It’s also possible that Russia has pulled some of these out of storage to act as crude decoys in a ploy to stimulate Ukraine’s air defenses, but we have no proof of this at this time. This crashed example would have been beyond its stated range from the Russian border, although it could have reached Zagreb if it was launched from Belarus.

Markiyan Lubkivsky, the chief adviser to the Ukrainian defense minister, told Croatian newspaper Jutarnji List that the crashed device did not belong to Ukraine and that the Ukrainian foreign ministry would later issue a statement on the incident.

“This drone did not have Ukrainian markings,” he was quoted as saying. “There were red stars on it” — a symbol of the Russian military.

Why was it not intercepted by NATO ?

“NATO’s integrated air and missile defence tracked the flight path of an object which subsequently crashed in Zagreb,” a NATO official confirmed in a statement. Hungarian authorities are also investigating the incident as “the airspace of several NATO member states, including Hungary, was involved in the drone flight,” foreign minister Péter Szijjártó said on Facebook.

Zagreb mayor Tomislav Tomašević said it was crucial

“to determine who piloted the aircraft and where it came from and to ensure that it never happens again”.

He said parts of the flying object are scattered in several locations and that it is incredible that no one was hurt.

A statement issued by Croatia’s government said the “pilotless military aircraft” crashed seven minutes after entering Croatia’s airspace from neighbouring Hungary at a speed of 700 kilometres per hour and an altitude of 1,300 metres.

According to a Press Release by the Romanian Ministry of National Defence Information and Public Relations Directorate

The Romanian air surveillance system picked up the signal of a low surface aircraft, Thursday March 10, most probably an UAV, that crossed the national air space for a very short time, under three minutes.

The Romanian air surveillance system picked up the signal of a low surface aircraft, Thursday March 10, most probably an UAV, that crossed the national air space for a very short time, under three minutes.

The aircraft entered the Romanian air space at approximately 2323 HRS, coming from Ukraine, and left the national air space at approximately 2326 HRS, heading towards Hungary.

The very short time for which this aircraft had flown through national air space, the high speed and low altitude, as well as the terrain and weather conditions at the time, did not allow engaging of other procedural means in order to further identity the aircraft.

Croatian President Zoran Milanovic said that they were investigating how it was possible for an aircraft to spend more than an hour in the airspace of NATO member countries without being noticed.

Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenković has reportedly already spoken to Viktor Orbán and NATO Ambassador Mario Nobilo. Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó said on Facebook that he had talked with his Croatian counterpart, Gordan Grlic Radman, about the case by phone. According to data currently available, the airspace of several NATO member states, including Hungary’s, have been affected in the flight path of the drone, he said. “During the assessment, we will closely cooperate with the Croatian authorities and other NATO allies,” Szijjártó noted.

11 Mar 22. Why has Russia’s emerging tech had so little impact on its invasion of Ukraine? What role is Russia’s emerging technology playing in their invasion of Ukraine?

The short answer: Not much right now, and that could be a problem as the conflict advances.

So far, the ongoing conflict has been a conventional war of iron and money. At least from public sources, Russia has not displayed the type of technologies that its military has been speculated to be developing or seen to be fielding in Syria and Crimea – advanced intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, unmanned aerial vehicle swarms, and sensor fusion, to name a few.

What we have seen out of Russia is the type of cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns that have come to be expected from the Kremlin in times of crisis – none of these have proven to be game changers or displays of new capabilities thus far. It is not a stretch to say Putin may have lost the information war both abroad and domestically, ultimately failing to keep abreast of technological advancements.

Indeed, some of the most impressive displays of advanced tech seem to be coming from U.S. companies aiding Ukrainian efforts.

From Microsoft warning the Ukrainian government when it detected Russian cyberattacks against Ukraine’s digital infrastructure hours before any missile was fired to Elon Musk’s lightning response to a tweet from Ukraine’s Vice President asking for Starlink satellite internet (not to mention Spacex’s ability to rapidly update Starlink software to bypass Russian short lived attempts to jam them), U.S. companies are easily thwarting Russian efforts to leverage technology for their offense.

It begs the question – what should the world make of this absence of more advanced military technology from Russia’s armed forces?

The tempting interpretation is simply that Russia’s military is not as capable as the West previously thought. It’s also feasible that Ukrainian forces were better prepared to resist than expected, not only on the physical battlefield but in the digital space as well. Ukraine’s Ministry of Digital Transformation, for example, reorganized and stood up an “IT Army” comprised of hundreds of thousands of IT professionals all aimed at countering Russian cyber maneuvers within days of fighting.

Whatever the reasons, Russia’s political and military leaders made a strategic choice, or error, thinking they could accomplish their near-term goals with limited conventional forces. Now, we see the effects of their recalibration as they turn to increasingly destructive strategies.

While this renewed offense has yet to incorporate more innovative technologies, there is still a possibility that the Kremlin will begin to leverage more advanced technologies in the future. Russia’s military already possess these capabilities, ranging from unmanned ground vehicles previously used in Syria to tactical and loitering UAVs which will arm Russian commanders with clearer battlefield situational awareness and hypersonic missiles. Of course, President Putin may also decide to launch more sophisticated cyberattacks with far-reaching implications.

With recent developments and these possibilities, the U.S. and its allies should prepare by expanding the kind of aid provided to Ukrainian defense forces.

In addition to counter UAV weapons, efforts should be made to help harden Ukraine’s command and control capabilities as well as civilian support infrastructure to ensure military and political leaders can continue to effectively coordinate defenses against Russian advances, even in the most austere environments.

The U.S. has an incredible defense innovation base of small tech companies able to provide dual-use commercial off-the shelf products quickly to those who need them. These non-traditional defense vendors possess market-proven, cutting edge technologies in everything from advanced cyber defenses and advanced materials manufacturing, to supportive supply-chain analysis, predictive maintenance and geospatial tech which could prove critical for food and ammunition distribution, aircraft and vehicle readiness, and battlefield intelligence and operations – all of which would be a force multiplier in backing the Ukraine’s forces.

While we haven’t seen Russia demonstrate particularly advanced technological capability in this conflict yet, it would be prudent for Ukraine, the U.S. and our allies to prepare as though more sophisticated attacks were possible and imminent. Innovation thrives in our defense industrial base and the U.S. private sector has been quick to respond to Ukraine’s call for assistance so far – the scale and sophistication of our own response could (and arguably should) increase as well to counter and get ahead of the effects of the increasingly brutal Russian aggression.

14 Mar 22. Ukrainians hold advantage in defending Kyiv, but they remain vulnerable to Russian air strikes. Urban fighting will put the Russians on the back foot, prompting fears Vladimir Putin will pulverise Ukraine’s capital. Ukraine’s tactical nous has so far seen its forces, by and large, refuse to engage the sharpest of the Russian bear’s claws. Instead, they have bypassed the strongest elements, targeting logistic units towards the rear; the oil that keeps the whole machine working. We’ve seen it in the 40-mile convoy that sat for a week north of Kyiv, unable to advance for want of resupplies. That situation seems to have changed and the Russian assault on the capital looks set to begin. Park for one moment the idea that Russian troops advancing on the city will probably have to do so along obvious routes (as the logistics vehicles have proved useless off road) – a boon to Ukrainian artillery and drone units. Russia’s tactics historically – in Syria and Chechnya, and witnessed to a degree in Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Mariupol – are to pulverise urban areas with artillery and missiles before any ground assault moves in. Most of the world hopes that is not going to happen in Kyiv. And so does Russia, assuming they want to capture the symbolic city largely intact. But a concentrated ground attack could put Putin’s army at a significant disadvantage. This type of battle, with radio communications severely limited, routes channelled by streets and the Ukrainian defenders knowing the terrain much better that the attackers, would require much higher standards of training and leadership, especially among junior Russian soldiers. In urban combat it is imperative to halt armoured vehicles moving at will. Street blockades built of metal and concrete must be erected. Tank traps – ditches too deep and wide for tracked vehicles to negotiate – must be dug. If the defences are too flimsy or shallow, tanks and other armoured vehicles will just climb over them or shove them aside. Knowing the exact size and capabilities of the approaching enemy vehicles is therefore critical information for any defenders. Any defences must be covered by firing points, to destroy tanks snarled up by lengths of barbed wire around the tracks, or the engineering vehicles brought forward to clear obstacles. In this, Ukraine will have an advantage both in the numbers of troops defending every street and the sheer quantity of anti-tank weapons that have flowed into the country over the past weeks.

Some anti-tank weapons, such as the Anglo-Swedish NLAW – 3,615 of which Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said last week had been sent to Ukraine – have minimal back-blasts on launch, to protect the soldier firing the weapon. It means every room in every building on every street could potentially harbour a defender. That will fix Russian minds, but may also mean they rely even more on destroying as much infrastructure as possible. Anti-tank weapons without “soft-launch” mechanisms are still extremely valuable in urban areas. Big open spaces in cities – perfect for “shoot-and-scoot” anti-tank missions – can still be found across parks and rivers or down long, wide streets. NLAW has a minimum range of 20 meters, making it very employable in built-up areas. A mix of ground troops hunting Russians with anti-tank weapons and Ukrainian tanks and other armoured vehicles will be required.

“The best anti-tank weapon in the world is another tank,” Ben Barry, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies says.

Ukrainian defenders will seek to hide their own tanks up side streets, firing into the flanks of passing Russian columns whilst being protected by soldiers swarming over nearby buildings. Urban fighting is gritty, exhausting and confusing, but historically has favoured the defender.

Mr Barry reckons the required ratio of attackers to defenders in urban terrain could be as high as 9:1. Many observers have questioned if Russia has enough soldiers.

In a social media post on Telegram, Igor Vsevolodovich Girkin, 51, also known by the alias Igor Ivanovich Strelkov, a Russian army veteran and former FSB officer, said “the ratio of manpower has already become in favor [sic] of Kyiv [and] this advantage will only increase”.

Mr Girkin played a key role in the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and later the war in the Donbas region of Ukraine. He was appointed Defence Minister to the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic.

In his Telegram post he said Russia’s early plans now seem “overly optimistic” and that without “partial mobilizations…the war cannot be won even in a few years”.

A Russian strategy of encirclement and bombardment means ground troops won’t need to be particularly competent, Mr Barry says. “They just have to be sufficiently competent to protect the artillery and rocket launchers.” Reports overnight of heavy fire on the outskirts of Kyiv could indicate Ukrainian efforts to repel Russian forces pushing west and south, to encircle the city. If Russia decides to stay outside the built-up areas and blast Kyiv with artillery, “the excellence of the Ukrainian army’s defence of urban areas would be a touch irrelevant,” Mr Barry says. Not being able to engage directly but having to suffer siege and aerial bombardment would be the “worst-case scenario” for Ukraine, he suggests. (Source: Daily Telegraph)

Russia has asked China for military assistance in its invasion of Ukraine, including the provision of drones, according to US officials.

Despite Beijing seeking to portray itself as an honest broker, Washington has been alarmed by the reports of Russia’s plea to China.

US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN that Washington was watching closely to see to what extent Beijing provided economic or material support to Russia, and would impose consequences if that occurred.

“We are communicating directly, privately to Beijing, that there will absolutely be consequences for large-scale sanctions evasion efforts or support to Russia to back fill them,” he said.

CNN reported that US officials believed Russia had sought drones as well as economic assistance.

A spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington said “I’ve never heard of that” when asked about the alleged requests. (Source: Daily Telegraph)

14 Mar 22. Ukraine’s leader expressed tentative hope on Monday about a diplomatic push for a ceasefire even as Russian forces continued to shell his country’s cities overnight, leaving hundreds of thousands of civilians trapped in siege conditions. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, said his representatives were discussing a possible meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin in online talks with Moscow, as negotiators noted some positive movement in recent days. Diplomats remain sceptical about a breakthrough to end a war that has laid waste to Ukrainian cities, brought down devastating sanctions on Russia, and shaken world markets. But officials close to the talks reported tentative progress over the weekend, including on limited political issues relating to a potential settlement. (Source: FT.com)

12 Mar 22. Ukraine says Russian forces kill seven civilians in evacuation convoy.

Summary

Bulk of Russian ground forces outside Kyiv, says UK

Ukraine says humanitarian corridors threatened

EU to impose new sanctions on Russia

Ukraine accused Russian forces on Saturday of killing seven civilians in an attack on women and children trying to flee fighting near Kyiv, and France said Russian President Vladimir Putin had shown he was not ready to make peace.

The Ukrainian intelligence service said the seven, including one child, were killed as they fled the village of Peremoha and that “the occupiers forced the remnants of the column to turn back.”

Reuters was unable immediately to verify the report and Russia offered no immediate comment. Moscow denies targeting civilians since invading Ukraine on Feb. 24 and blames Ukraine for failed attempts to evacuate civilians from encircled cities.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said earlier that Moscow was sending in new troops after Ukrainian forces put 31 of Russia’s battalion tactical groups out of action in what he called Russia’s largest army losses in decades. It was not possible to verify his statements.

He also said about 1,300 Ukrainian troops had been killed so far and urged the West to get more involved in peace negotiations. The president suggested Russian forces would face a fight to the death if they sought to enter the capital.

“If they decide to carpet bomb (Kyiv), and simply erase the history of this region … and destroy all of us, then they will enter Kyiv. If that’s their goal, let them come in, but they will have to live on this land by themselves,” he said.

Zelenskiy discussed the war with Chancellor Olaf Scholz and President Emmanuel Macron, and the German and French leaders then spoke to Putin by phone and urged the Russian leader to order an immediate ceasefire.

A Kremlin statement on the 75-minute call made no mention of a ceasefire and a French presidency official said: “We did not detect a willingness on Putin’s part to end the war”.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov accused the United States of escalating tensions and said the situation had been complicated by convoys of Western arms shipments to Ukraine that Russian forces considered “legitimate targets”.

In comments reported by the Tass news agency, Ryabkov made no specific threat, but any attack on such convoys before they reached Ukraine would risk widening the war.

Responding to Zelenskiy’s call for the West to be more involved in peace negotiations, a U.S. State Department spokesperson said: “If there are diplomatic steps that we can take that the Ukrainian government believes would be helpful, we’re prepared to take them.”

Crisis talks between Moscow and Kyiv have been continuing via a video link, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying by Russia’s RIA news agency. He gave no details but Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Kyiv would not surrender or accept any ultimatums. read more

HUMANITARIAN CORRIDORS

Air raid sirens blared across most Ukrainian cities on Saturday morning, local media reported.

Russian rocket attacks destroyed a Ukrainian airbase and hit an ammunition depot near the town of Vasylkiv in the Kyiv region, Interfax Ukraine quoted its mayor as saying.

The exhausted-looking governor of Chernihiv, around 150 km (100 miles) northeast of Kyiv, gave a video update in front of the ruins of the city’s Ukraine Hotel, which he said had been hit.

“There is no such hotel any more,” Viacheslav Chaus said, wiping tears from his eyes. “But Ukraine itself still exists, and it will prevail.”

Britain’s defence ministry said fighting northwest of the capital continued, with the bulk of Russian ground forces 25 km (16 miles) from the centre of Kyiv, which it has said Russia could attack within days.

Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol remained encircled under heavy Russian shelling, it said.

Russia’s invasion has been almost universally condemned around the world and that has drawn tough Western sanctions on Russia.

The Russian bombardment has trapped thousands of people in besieged cities and sent 2.5 million Ukrainians fleeing to neighbouring countries. Zelenskiy said the conflict meant some small Ukrainian towns no longer existed.

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation” that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its neighbour’s military capabilities and “de-Nazify” the country.

Ukrainian officials had planned to use humanitarian corridors from Mariupol as well as towns and villages in the regions of Kyiv, Sumy and some other areas on Saturday.

The governor of the Kyiv region, Oleksiy Kuleba, said fighting and threats of Russian air attacks were continuing on Saturday morning though some evacuations were proceeding.

The Donetsk region’s governor said constant shelling was complicating bringing aid into the southern city of Mariupol.

“There are reports of looting and violent confrontations among civilians over what little basic supplies remain in the city,” the U.N.’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said.

“Medicines for life-threatening illnesses are quickly running out, hospitals are only partially functioning, and the food and water are in short supply.”

MAKESHIFT BURIALS

People were boiling ground water for drinking, using wood to cook food and burying dead bodies near where they lay, a staff member for Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors without Borders) in Mariupol said.

“We saw people who died because of lack of medication,” he said, adding that many people had also been wounded or killed. “Neighbours just dig a hole in the ground and put the dead bodies inside.”

At least 1,582 civilians in Mariupol have been killed as a result of Russian shelling and a 12-day blockade, the city council said on Friday. It was not possible to verify casualty figures. Efforts to isolate Russia economically have stepped up, with the United States imposing new sanctions on senior Kremlin officials and Russian oligarchs on Friday. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU would on Saturday suspend Moscow’s privileged trade and economic treatment, crack down on its use of crypto-assets, and ban the import of iron and steel goods from Russia, as well as the export of luxury goods in the other direction.

12 Mar 22. Russia has warned that it will fire on western armaments shipments to Kyiv, raising the risk of a direct military confrontation between Moscow and Nato during the war in Ukraine. Deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Saturday that “pumping up [Ukraine] with weapons from a whole range of countries” was “not just a dangerous move — it’s something that turns these convoys into legitimate military targets”, according to the Interfax news agency. US president Joe Biden has rejected calls from Kyiv to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine and said Nato will not be drawn into an all-out conflict with Russia or send troops to defend the country. However, Ukraine’s western backers have pledged significant military aid to the country. The US has promised $6.5bn in defence spending, the UK has sent 3,615 NLAW anti-tank missiles and Javelin anti-tank weapons while Nordic states have sent more than 10,000 anti-tank weapons.

11 Mar 22. Pentagon revives team to speed arms to Ukraine and allies, sources say. The Pentagon is turning to a special team to respond to increased demand for new weapons sales and requests to transfer existing weapons among U.S. allies as countries including Ukraine scramble to obtain arms following Russia’s invasion, three people familiar with the effort said.

The Pentagon’s office of Acquisition and Sustainment, the weapons buyer for the U.S. Department of Defense, has been fielding increased demand from European allies hoping to ship weapons to Ukraine through third party transfers or to buy arms to bolster their own defenses, the sources said.

The rapid response team was revived in recent days to coordinate and cut through the bureaucracy around sales and transfers while prioritizing requests from allies, the sources said.

The previously unreported effort comes as the Pentagon works to respond to a rapidly changing landscape for arms deals and transfers. The Pentagon made use of the rapid response team during the Trump administration.

“As part of Department of Defense’s ongoing supply chain resilience efforts, the Department is evaluating industrial base capacity to produce items critical to our national security and that of our allies and partners. This effort is focused on identifying key supply chain constraints and mitigation actions to improve capacity,” a defense official said.

The operation is being run in cooperation with the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency, which oversees weapons sales and transfers to other countries for the Department of Defense.

According to an email seen by Reuters, DSCA recently asked the defense industry for devices that can be used to disable or shoot down drones that were either in stock or could be ready for delivery in 120 days.

“In light of the ongoing crisis in Europe, the USG (U.S. government) continues its efforts to identify effective solutions which would assist Ukraine in the ongoing situation. One of our focus areas is C-sUAS,” the message said. Counter small unmanned aerial systems (C-sUAS) technology is used to defeat drones.

Counter-drone devices come in a variety of sizes, prices and formats including the portable radar gun-like Dronekiller made by IXI Electronic Warfare and the Dronebuster from Radio Hill Technologies that can cost in the tens of thousands of dollars each. There are also larger versions of the technology including one that could shield an area the size of a stadium made by SRC Inc. The larger systems can cost in the $3 million to $6 million range, industry executives have said.

The Pentagon has stressed that smaller systems such as Javelin anti-tank systems and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, which allies are shipping to Ukraine via truck near-daily, are most useful.

“We believe the best way to support Ukrainian defense is by providing them the weapons and the systems they need most to defeat Russian aggression, in particular anti-armor and air defense,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby has said.

In some cases allies are trying to leverage the Ukraine situation to “press for things they wanted even before the conflict,” one U.S. official said on condition of anonymity, adding that supply chains are still stressed from the pandemic so there was uncertainty about how this demand could be immediately met. Countries in Europe – and across the globe – are looking at expanding defense budgets to meet an increasingly uncertain security outlook, with Germany among those promising a sharp increase in spending.

12 Mar 22. Ukraine at ‘turning point’, Zelenskiy says as Russians regroup near Kyiv.

Summary

U.S. sanctions hit top Kremlin staff, oligarchs

EU imposes new sanctions on Russia

Satellite images show Russians redeploying north of Kyiv

Civilians huddle underground as Russia bombards cities

Ukraine was at a turning point in the war with Russian forces appearing to be regroup for a possible assault on Kyiv, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, as the United States imposed new sanctions on senior Kremlin officials and Russian oligarchs.

With the Russian assault in its third week, Zelenskiy, who has rallied his people with a series of addresses from the capital Kyiv, said Ukraine had “already reached a strategic turning point”.

“It is impossible to say how many days we still have (ahead of us) to free Ukrainian land. But we can say we will do it,” he said. “We are already moving towards our goal, our victory.”

The United States on Friday imposed sanctions on Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg, three family members of President Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson and lawmakers in the latest punishment for Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion. read more

“Treasury continues to hold Russian officials to account for enabling Putin’s unjustified and unprovoked war,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said.

Russian forces kept up their bombardment of cities across the country on Friday in the biggest assault on a European country since World War Two. Satellite images showed them firing artillery as they advanced on Kyiv.

The fighting has created more than 2 million refugees, and thousands of Ukrainians are trapped in besieged cities.

As hundreds sheltered in Kharkiv metro stations, Nastya, a young girl lying on a makeshift bed on the floor of a train carriage, said she had been there for over a week, unable to move around much and ill with a virus.

“I’m scared for my home, for the homes of my friends, very scared for the whole country, and scared for myself of course,” she said. read more

Putin calls the invasion a “special operation” to disarm Ukraine and unseat leaders it calls neo-Nazis. Ukraine and Western allies call this a baseless pretext for a war of choice that has raised fears of wider conflict in Europe.

PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

The governor of the Kharkiv region on the Russian border, said a psychiatric hospital had been hit, and the mayor of the city of Kharkiv said about 50 schools there had been destroyed.

In the besieged southern city of Mariupol, the city council said at least 1,582 civilians had been killed by Russian shelling and a 12-day blockade that has left hundreds of thousands trapped with no food, water, heat or power.

Moscow denies targeting civilians.

Russia’s defence ministry said the Black Sea port was surrounded, while Ukrainian officials accused Russia of deliberately preventing civilians getting out and humanitarian convoys getting in.

A new effort to evacuate civilians along a humanitarian corridor from Mariupol appeared to have failed, as Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Russian shelling prevented them from leaving.

“The situation is critical,” Ukrainian interior ministry adviser Vadym Denysenko said.

Western countries meanwhile took more economic steps to try to force Putin to end his assault.

President Joe Biden, who this week banned U.S. imports of Russian oil, said the G7 industrial powers would revoke Russia’s “most favoured nation” trade status.

Biden banned U.S. imports of Russian seafood, alcohol and diamonds. Washington sanctioned more oligarchs and elites, including board members of Russian banks, and a dozen lawmakers.

European Union leaders said they were ready to impose harsher sanctions on Russia and might give Ukraine more funds for arms. But they rejected Ukraine’s request to join the bloc.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that the EU would on Saturday suspend Moscow’s privileged trade and economic treatment, crack down on its use of crypto-assets, and ban the import of iron and steel goods from Russia, as well as the export of luxury goods in the other direction. read more

GEARING UP

Russia’s main force has been stalled north of Kyiv, having failed in what Western analysts say was an initial plan for a lightning assault.

But Britain’s defence ministry said Russia appeared to be gearing up for a new offensive in coming days that would probably include Kyiv.

Images taken on Friday and released by private U.S. satellite firm Maxar showed Russian forces were continuing to deploy closer to Kyiv and firing artillery toward residential areas, according to the company’s analysis.

Multiple homes and buildings were on fire and widespread damage was seen throughout the town of Moschun, northwest of Kyiv, Maxar said. Reuters could not independently verify the images.

But Britain’s intelligence update said Russian ground forces were still making only limited progress, hampered by logistical problems and Ukrainian resistance.

The Ukrainian general staff said Russian forces were regrouping after taking heavy losses. Ukrainian troops had pushed some back to “unfavourable positions” near the Belarus border, it said.

Kyiv’s mayor, former heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, said the capital had enough essential supplies to last a couple of weeks. Supply lines remained open.

BELARUS

At a meeting with Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, Putin said there were “certain positive shifts” in talks with Kyiv, but did not elaborate.

Ukraine has raised the prospect of Moscow’s ally Belarus entering the war, accusing Russia of staging “false flag” air attacks on Belarus from Ukraine to provide an excuse.

Belarus has served as a staging post for Russian force",https://battle-updates.com/update/ukraine-conflict-update-march-14th/
250,0d25c56e-a412-4086-9fa0-d02dd155e8ad,"['Foreign Correspondent', 'Chris Brown Is A Foreign Correspondent Based In The Cbc S London Bureau. Previously In Moscow', 'Chris Has A Passion For Great Stories', 'Has Travelled All Over Canada', 'The World To Find Them.']",,"The announcement from the Russian news agency TASS over the weekend might have sounded too good to be true for Ukrainians, and for those distraught by the devastation inflicted by Russian bombs and missiles on Ukrainian cities and civilians.

It quoted prominent Russian Duma deputy Leonid Slutsky as saying peace talks between Ukraine and Russia have made ""considerable progress"" and that ""documents could be signed"" within days.

In response, Ukrainian negotiators said they sensed a shift in the utterly unfounded Russian position of its ""denazification"" and ""demilitarization"" of Ukraine. They also said they sensed that their own demands were finally being listened to by the Russian officials on the other side of the table.

But in interviews with CBC News, Ukrainian leaders and one former Ukrainian diplomat are putting little faith in this current round of talks to stop the war.

Instead, they believe Russian statements that negotiations are progressing are, at best, disingenuous — and are more likely an effort to deflect failure to secure a ceasefire onto Ukraine.

'Everyone in Ukraine wants peace'

They also fear it will take another lengthy period of intense warfare, with a high number of civilian casualties, before the Kremlin is ready to make a deal that Ukraine could accept.

""Listen, I think Putin was very clear when he explained that he just does not accept the idea of Ukraine,"" said Andriy Shevchenko, a former Ukrainian MP who served as Ukraine's ambassador in Ottawa for six years, until 2021.

He told CBC News that most Ukrainians see Russian President Vladimir Putin's war of aggression against their nation as an effort to destroy the Ukrainian identity.

""I think he cannot acknowledge any chance for Ukraine being a sovereign nation, deciding for itself what kind of future it wants to have,"" Shevchenko said. ""Everyone in Ukraine again badly wants peace, but I think our expectations for these negotiations are very low at the moment.""

Shevchenko spoke to CBC News in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, where he is organizing an international media centre to help share Ukrainian perspectives about the war with the rest of the world.

Despite the danger, he continues to travel back and forth to the capital, Kyiv, where his wife is a TV presenter and reports on Ukraine's defence.

""We are dealing with a man [Putin] who is absolutely obsessed with historical delusions and hallucinations, and I think it's just a waste of time trying to figure out what exactly he wants,"" Shevchenko said.

Until now, the public position taken by Russian negotiators has been to demand Ukraine's unconditional surrender, along with the removal of Volodymyr Zelensky as president.

They have also indicated that any future Ukrainian government would have to change its constitution to prohibit it from joining organizations like the European Union or military alliances such as NATO.

Russia expected a swift military strike: U.S.

Few people outside of the Kremlin, however, know exactly what Putin's next steps might be. The country's decision to criminalize publishing information contradictory to the Russian government's position on the war has made it extraordinarily difficult for media to access to it.

American intelligence officials, however, believe Russia's original plan was to stage a lightning military strike on the capital Kyiv, capture or kill the Ukrainian president and replace him with a Russian-friendly leader.

Almost three weeks after the invasion, however, Russia's main military thrust on the capital appears to have stalled.

Beyond Kyiv, its troops have failed to capture most of their key objectives, although the loss of civilian lives and the destruction inflicted on its cities has been horrendous.

Much of Kharkiv — a city formerly of 1.3 million people — is in ruins.

Mykolaiv and Mariupol to the south have badly damaged by bombing, although Ukrainian soldiers and civilians remaining inside those cities continue to prevent Russian troops from taking over.

Ukraine claims it has killed 12,000 Russian soldiers , destroyed almost 400 tanks and shot down 160 aircraft and helicopters, although the Pentagon has estimated its casualties as between 2,000 and 4,000.

While none of those claims have been independently verified, even if the actual Russian losses are a third of what Ukraine says they are they would still represent a humiliating setback for a military that was once touted as one of the strongest in the world.

Still, for all of the efforts of Ukraine's army, Russian forces have managed to push deep into Ukraine's southern areas, capturing territory around the Sea of Azov and linking up to form what's known as a land bridge with separatist enclaves of Donbas and Luhansk.

In any peace negotiation, experts told CBC News that it's difficult to picture Russia giving back the Ukrainian territory it has seized — and yet, for Ukraine's Zelensky, allowing Russia to keep the land would be toxic to a population that's furious with Russia for launching this war.

""I think the price that we have been paying is so tremendous, is so huge, and we are not ready to give up our territory and our people,"" Shevchenko said.

Alexander Lanoszka, an assistant professor of international relations at the University of Waterloo, says Russia's behaviour over the past few days indicates the Kremlin leadership may no longer believe its military can accomplish a takeover of Ukraine, and the Ukrainian side may be correct at sensing some weakness.

Maksym Kozytskyy, the governor of the Lviv oblast, or administrative region, says he hopes the West will bolster Ukraine's position in its peace talks with Russia. (Stephanie Jenzer/CBC News)

Why Ukraine might hold out on a deal

Russia ""is taking battlefield losses; it's making unusual requests to China [for military help] as well as asking for Syrian mercenaries and Belarussian military participation, all of which suggests that there's a major lack of confidence on the Russian side that they can pull this thing off,"" Lanoszka said.

But he says Ukraine also runs the risk of overestimating its bargaining position and holding out for a more favourable offer — rather than the first that might end the war.

""If you see your adversary suffering and moderating their war aims accordingly, then that in turn encourages you to escalate your own war aims and to take the fight even further,"" Lanoszka said.

In the aftermath of the 2014 popular revolution in Ukraine that dumped a Russian-leaning government for one that was more pro-European, Russia seized the Ukraine-controlled Crimean Peninsula. The Kremlin also triggered and subsequently fuelled an eight-year war between pro-Russian separatists and the Ukrainian government in the Donetsk region.

Many Ukrainians now talk openly about having their army not just push Russian troops back to where they were when their invasion began on Feb. 24, but to recapture the other Russian-controlled regions too, especially Crimea.

""They're angry and they have every right to be,"" Lanoszka said. ""But that anger could obfuscate what could be done reasonably; I don't think Russia is going to concede Crimea.""

In other interviews, Ukrainian officials refuse to directly address what they're prepared to give up in order to get a ceasefire.

""We will accept only one thing: the victory of the Ukrainian people over this horde,"" said Maksym Kozytskyy, the governor of Lviv oblast, as Ukraine's administrative regions, or provinces, are called.

Let them get out of Ukraine, and only then will we talk to them.""

His region, along with the city at the centre of it in western Ukraine, was hit with several Russian airstrikes in the past week, including a devastating attack on a Ukrainian military base that used to host trainers from NATO countries, including Canada.

There were 35 people killed and more than 150 injured in the attack on the Yavoriv training base early Sunday morning.

Expectations of NATO allies

Rather than discussing possible compromises, however, Kozytskky told CBC News that Western nations should be asking how they can do more to improve Ukraine's negotiating position.

""The whole world overestimated the Russians' influence and their power — the Ukrainian army has demonstrated that,"" he said. ""So let's talk honestly — if the West will help us with weapons, in time, our position during negotiations will be much stronger.""

Shevchenko, the former ambassador, says Zelensky's team is correct to pursue a negotiated settlement with Russia and since the country is firmly behind him, the president will have tremendous credibility if he asks Ukrainians to make sacrifices for the cause of peace.

At the same time, he says, he doesn't expect that time will come any day soon.

It was where families living further east sent their children to keep them safe.

Vasyl Kunets, a driver who lives in Novoyavorivsk, a town about 20 miles from Lviv, said that up until now, when the sirens indicating a potential air raid went off, he wasn’t too worried. He’d go to safety, but perhaps not as fast as he should have.

The war was still far away.

That all changed when Russian strikes hit the Yavoriv military training ground at the edge of Novoyavorivsk and killed 35 people, the Lviv regional administration said Sunday.

More than 30 missiles fired from warplanes over the Black and Azov seas had hit the military base, said Maksym Kozytsky, head of the Lviv regional military administration, in a statement posted to Facebook Sunday.

Suddenly, the war was on Kunets’ doorstep.

The training base is intertwined with the life in the town. Many of its residents are employed there, or in services supporting it. Those who don’t work for it directly know someone who does.

Kunets saw the damage they’ve inflicted first hand.

""I saw when the rocket hit the ground, I've seen the explosion and the smoke, a mushroom cloud of smoke and fire,"" he told CNN.

""It lasted 30 minutes and I heard maybe eight strikes, maybe some rockets crashing or part of rockets exploding separately, I don’t know.""

Kunets told CNN the attack against the base ""changed everything.""

""We are worried now. I'm not worried for myself but for my kids. People are worried about the safety of their families and some of them are considering moving somewhere else,"" he said.

Kunets said he is now thinking about sending his two children away from Ukraine -- something he didn’t necessarily consider before.

""It feels less safe and more dangerous. Yesterday and the day before yesterday we were more relaxed and when we heard the alarms we didn't move so quick, we didn't take it too seriously. But today we are packing and being ready to leave very fast when we hear the alarm,"" he said.

An award-winning US journalist and filmmaker has died in northern Ukraine after he was fatally shot in the neck by Russian forces in Irpin, near Kyiv, earlier today.

Brent Renaud was killed and two other reporters were wounded and rushed to hospital, according to Kyiv regional police chief Andrey Nebitov, who shared a photograph of what appeared to be Mr Renaud’s press credentials issued by The New York Times.

The 50-year-old was in a car with other foreign members of the press when Russian troops opened fire on the vehicle, reports say.

A video released on Twitter by the Ukrainian Parliament (Verkhovna Rada) showed Mr Renaud’s colleague on a stretcher in the hospital, describing the horrifying ambush.

‘We are across the first bridge in Irpin, we were going to film refugees leaving’, the colleague explains.

‘We got into a car as someone offered to take us to the other bridge and we crossed the checkpoint and they started shooting at us.

‘So, the driver turned around but they kept shooting. There was two of us, my friend is Brent Renaud and he has been shot and left behind. He got shot in the neck. We got split.’

When Mr Renaud’s colleague was interviewed, he was still unaware of his friend’s death, which was later confirmed by Verkhovna Rada and witnesses.

In a statement on Twitter, PBS foreign correspondent Jane Ferguson said: ‘Just left roadside spot near Irpin where body of American journalist Brent Renaud lay under a blanket.

‘Ukranian medics could do nothing to help him by that stage. Outraged Ukranian police officer: “Tell America, tell the world, what they did to a journalist”.’

Cliff Levy, deputy managing editor at the New York Times, said the newspaper was ‘deeply saddened’ by his death but confirmed he was not on assignment for the New York Times at the time.

A statement released by the newspaper read: ‘We are deeply saddened to hear of Brent Renaud’s death.

‘Though he had contributed to The Times in the past (most recently in 2015), he was not on assignment for any desk at the The Times in Ukraine.

‘Early reports that he worked for Times circulated because he was wearing a Times press badge that he had been issued for an assignment many years ago.’

Tributes have poured in for Mr Renaud, with his colleagues describing him as a ‘filmmaker without parallel’ and a ‘talented photographer’.

He had worked for a number of American news and media organizations in the past, including HBO, NBC and The New York Times, and was a Peabody and DuPont Award winning filmmaker,

In the last 20 years, he had been producing films and television programs with his brother Craig, focusing on hot-spots like the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

257,c55df62d-153a-4616-85a9-fd493f2c1c36,['Stefan Becket'],,"Washington — An American journalist was killed and another was wounded by Russian forces in the town of Irpin outside the capital of Kyiv as they were traveling to film refugees, Ukrainian police said Sunday.

Brent Renaud, a 50-year-old filmmaker, was killed when Russian troops opened fire, according to Andriy Nebytov, the head of Kyiv's regional police force. Nebytov posted a graphic photo purportedly of Renaud's body on Facebook, as well as pictures of his American passport and media credentials issued by The New York Times.

A spokeswoman for the Times said Renaud was ""a talented filmmaker who had contributed to The New York Times over the years,"" most recently in 2015, but he ""was not on assignment for any desk at The Times in Ukraine."" TIME issued a statement later Sunday confirming that Renaud had been ""in the region working on a TIME Studios project focused on the global refugee crisis.""

Documentary filmmaker Juan Arredondo was injured in the attack, according to local reports and a video posted by a spokeswoman for a public hospital in Kyiv. Arredondo, who was lying on a hospital gurney, said he and Renaud were on their way to film people leaving Kyiv when they crossed a checkpoint and came under fire.

""Somebody offered to take us to the other bridge, and we crossed a checkpoint, and they started shooting at us. So the driver turned around, and they kept shooting, two of us. My friend is Brent Renaud, and he's been shot and left behind,"" said Arredondo, who is also American. ""I saw him being shot in the neck, and we got split, and I got pulled.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky honored Renaud as a ""talented and brave journalist"" in a letter to Renaud's family on Monday. Zelensky wrote that Renaud ""lost his life while documenting human tragedy, devastation and suffering of the millions of Ukrainians.""

""The people of Ukraine, who are fighting against the Russian regime to defend their Homeland and democracy in the world, are mourning with you,"" Zelensky said. ""We are thankful to Brent for his professionalism and commitment to the values of compassion, ethics and justice.""

The State Department confirmed Renaud's death in a statement later Sunday, saying it is ""offering all possible consular assistance"" to his family.

""We offer our sincerest condolences to his family on their loss,"" a spokesperson said.

Nebytov, the Kyiv police chief, wrote that Renaud ""paid [with] his life for trying to highlight the aggressor's ingenuity, cruelty and ruthlessness,"" according to an automated translation of his Facebook post.

Renaud and his brother Craig Renaud have reported from a number of global hotspots over the past two decades, including Iraq, Afghanistan and Egypt, according to a biography on their website. The pair won a Peabody Award in 2015 for an eight-part documentary for Vice News about a school in Chicago for students with severe emotional issues.

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan called reports of Renaud's death ""shocking and horrifying,"" telling ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday that the U.S. and its allies would impose ""appropriate consequences"" against Russia for the killing.

""I will just say that this is part and parcel of what has been a brazen aggression on the part of the Russians where they have targeted civilians, they have targeted hospitals, they have targeted places of worship and they have targeted journalists,"" Sullivan said.

An American freelance filmmaker who was shot dead by Russian troops while filming refugees in Irpin, a suburb of the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, had an eerily similar brush with death during a previous assignment in Cambodia.

Brent Renaud, 50, was in a car with other journalists when Putin's troops opened fire. He was fatally-shot in the neck, with one of his colleagues also injured.

A tribute piece in the New York Times revealed Renaud had survived a similar incident during a previous mission to Cambodia in the early 1990s, after driving through a military checkpoint with locals. That prompted soldiers stationed there to open fire on him, although Renaud survived that incident unscathed.

Discussing the incident - which happened shortly after he graduated, Renaud told Filmmaker magazine: 'On the first day filming I found myself on the wrong side of town with the wrong players, and nearly got killed when the car I was riding in busted through a military checkpoint, drawing fire on the car from the soldiers.'

Brent Renaud, 50, was in a car with other journalists when Putin's troops opened fire on him. He has worked in numerous conflict zones around the world and had won awards for his documentaries

Revealing another near-deadly scrape, he continued: 'On another occasion I jumped on a motorbike with a translator and rode into the jungle for an interview with a villager I had managed to set up. What I failed to realize was that the subject I was to interview lived in a village still controlled by the Khmer Rouge, the brutal communist rebels who were responsible for killing one third of the entire population of the country in the 1970’s.

'Things got bad enough that it required a heavily armed military rescue – fortunately orchestrated by the general I had made friends with at the beginning of the trip.'

Although Renaud was carrying a New York Times press badge at the time of his death, he was in fact working as a freelancer on a global film about refugees commissioned by Time magazine's studio division.

Renaud's death was announced by Andrey Nebitov, the head of Kyiv's police department, who said he paid 'with his life for trying to highlight the aggressor's ingenuity, cruelty and ruthlessness.'

But less than a decade earlier, Renaud recalled how he had found himself working under similar life-threatening situations. He was attacked by thugs while reporting on a crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood in Cairo and found himself at gunpoint several times while working on documentaries in both Mexico and Cambodia.

On another occasion, while working in Mexico in 1994, Renaud decided to travel by himself through the state of Chiapas close to the border with Guatemala, during the Zapatista uprising.

'With absolutely no experience abroad, and way too much confidence in the very little Spanish I spoke at the time, I also failed to understand the extent of the dangers around me. Long story short, a soldier held a 9 mm pistol to my head while another attempted to dangle me off the side of an ancient pyramid.'

'There is so much you cannot control in a conflict zone, but you can get really good at judging risk accurately, and that can save your life more than anything else,' he continued. 'Knock on wood, there are many situations we get ourselves into that we honestly believe are not dangerous for us, but might likely get someone less experienced killed.

In Cambodia, in the early 90s, Renaud, pictured, told how he was working in the country alongside his brother Craig when he was fired upon having driven through a checkpoint

'It's a game of percentages, and even in the most dangerous places on earth your chances of survival are really high, and if you have a little extra experience with negotiating roadblocks, negotiating with warlords, and knowing where to stand when things get hairy, you really can do the job fairly safely. If we did not believe that we wouldn't do it.'

Sadly, Renaud lost his life on Sunday as he crossed just such a checkpoint that he had described years earlier.

Captain Oleksandr Bogai, the deputy chief of police in Irpin, said Renaud was shot in the head when Russian forces fired at his car. The vehicle was being driven by a local civilian across a Ukrainian checkpoint.

Another US journalist who survived the attack spoke to a reporter for Italian paper Internazionale from the hospital.

Juan Arredondo said Renaud had been shot in the neck and 'had to be left behind'.

'We had crossed the first bridge in Irpin. We were going to film other refugees leaving we got into a car. Somebody offered to take us to the other bridge. We crossed a checkpoint and they started shooting at us. The driver turned around, there were two of us. My friend is Brent Renaud. He has been shot and left behind. I saw he has been shot in the neck. We got split,' he said.

Born in Memphis in 1971, Renaud grew up in Little Rock, Arkansas, a town along with New York that he still called home. His father, Louis, was a salesman, while his mother, Georgann Freasier, was a social worker.

In the late 1990s he earned a master’s degree at Columbia University Teacher's College and started working at the Downtown Community Television Center, an organization and teaches filmmaking. His brother Craig was hit by the same filmmaking bug and moved to the city to join him.

Alongside his brother, he is survived by both of his parents and a sister, Michele Purifoy.

Signs and pictures of those killed, including journalist Brent Renaud, are displayed on a fence during a protest against Russia's invasion of Ukraine outside of the White House, on Sunday, in Washington D.C.

Brent was working for the television and film division of Time Magazine on a series about refugees around the world called Tipping Point.

'Brent was in the region working on a Time Studios project focused on the global refugee crisis,' the editor in chief of Time, Edward Felsenthal, and the president of Time and Time Studios, Ian Orefice, said in a statement.

Statement by VICE Media Group on the killing of journalist Brent Renaud in Ukraine

'Our hearts are with all of Brent's loved ones. It is essential that journalists are able to safely cover this ongoing invasion and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.'

The Renaud brothers had long covered stories of migration under the desperate circumstances and had made documentaries about Haitians deported from the U.S. and children escaping poverty and violence in Latin America.

The brothers tackled tough issues including the drugs war, addiction, gang violence, homelessness and environmental disasters.

The White House has not yet commented on Renaud's death but National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan called it 'shocking and horrifying.' He said the US would consult with Ukrainian officials about what to do next.

It remains unclear if Biden will retaliate against Putin. Earlier on Sunday, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said Putin is finally starting to show signs of 'willingness' to negotiate to end the war but that up until now he has seemed 'intent on destroying Ukraine'.

Putin shows 'willingness' to negotiate, US says Russia is showing signs of a willingness to engage in substantive negotiations over Ukraine, even as Moscow currently is intent on 'destroying' its neighbor, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said on Sunday. Sherman, in an interview with 'Fox News Sunday', said the United States is putting 'enormous pressure' on Russian President Vladimir Putin to agree to a cease-fire in its weeks-old invasion of Ukraine and to allow the creation of humanitarian corridors to allow civilians to escape. 'That pressure is beginning to have some effect. We are seeing some signs to have real, serious negotiations. But I have to say... so far it appears Vladimir Putin is intent on destroying Ukraine,' Sherman said. Earlier, she said: 'Right now it looks like it ends very badly already for the Ukrainian people. It is just awful. Particularly in Mauripol where people are going to starve to death or freeze to death or die because they don't have their medicine. It is truly horrifying. 'There are two objectives that we have - one is to support Ukraine in every way we can. The second is to put enormous pressure on Vladimir Putin to change his calculus to either end this war, get a ceasefire in the first instance and to get humanitarian corridors. 'That pressure is beginning to have some effect we are seeing signs of willingness to have real, serious negotiations but I have to say so far, it appears Vladimir Putin is intent on destroying Ukraine,' she said.

National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said in an appearance on CNN on Sunday morning: 'It is a shocking and horrifying event.

'It is one more example of the brutality of Vladimir Putin and his forces as they target schools, mosques, hospitals and journalists.

'It is why we are working so hard to impose severe consequences on him and to try to help Ukrainians with every type of military assistance we can muster to be able to push back against the onslaught of these Russian forces.'

PBS reporter Jane Ferguson, who is in Ukraine, tweeted: 'Just left roadside spot near Irpin where body of American journalist Brent Renaud lay under a blanket. Ukrainian medics could do nothing to help him by that stage.

'Outraged Ukrainian police officer: 'Tell America, tell the world, what they did to a journalist.''

Tributes are now pouring in to Renaud.

Christof Putzel, a friend who worked with him, told The Associated Press: 'This guy was the absolute best.

'He was just the absolute best war journalist that I know.

'This is a guy who literally went to every conflict zone.'

The Times has issued a statement to clarify that while Renaud worked for them in the past, he was not in Ukraine on assignment for them.

'We are deeply saddened to hear of Brent Renaud's death. Brent was a talented photographer and filmmaker who contributed to The New York Times over the years.

'Early reports that he worked for The Times circulated because he was wearing a Times press badge that had been issued for an assignment many years ago,' Cliff Levy, Deputy Managing Editor, said in a statement.

He added: 'Brent's death is a terrible loss.

'Brave journalists like Brent take tremendous risks to bear witness and to tell the world about the devastation and suffering caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

David Rummel, who was a former senior producer of video at The New York Times said the Renaud's brothers reporting would often examine unexplored angles, such as the children of Mexican gang members.

'I'd never seen anything like that before,They'd take the time to find the story that nobody else was doing,' Rummel said, noting that he 'was often concerned about their well-being,' while adding, 'It wasn't like they were oblivious to the consequences of going where they went. They weren't taking inordinate risks.'

Renaud would often spend a year covering one particular subject in order to immerse himself in the story. He rarely used crews or even tools such as a tripod of light.

'It's about being so close you're almost seeing things from the subject's point of view,' he told the trade publication American Cinematographer in 2007. 'We try to disappear.'

The White House has not commented on Renaud's death.

President Biden has taken a firm stance on not sending American troops into the conflict.

He has instead sanctioned Putin economically, along with the rest of the Western world, and has given Zelensky arms and aid.

On February 15, he warned: 'We are not seeking direct confrontation with Russia, though I have been clear that if Russia targets Americans in Ukraine, we will respond forcefully.'

National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said in an appearance on CNN on Sunday morning: 'It is a shocking and horrifying event. It is one more example of the brutality of Vladimir Putin and his forces as they target schools, mosques, hospitals and journalists.'

He is best known for working with his brother, Craig, on films including a series that aired on the Discovery Channel about soldiers from Arkansas deployed to Afghanistan.

Putin's army is now expanding its assault on Ukraine and targeting cities that are closer to NATO ground. On Sunday, explosions were heard in the western city of Lviv, a haven for refugees.

As the war continued, Pope Francis on Sunday begged Putin to stop the fighting.

'In the name of God, I ask you, stop this massacre. With pain in my heart I join my voice to that of the common people, who implore an end to the war.

'Let there be a real and decisive focus on negotiation, and let the humanitarian corridors be effective and safe,' he told crowds gathered in Vatican Square.

Brent Renaud, an award-winning filmmaker who spent years documenting conflict in hot spots across the world—often with his brother, Craig—was killed while reporting near Irpin, a suburb of Kyiv. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said it could not yet confirm the circumstances of the shooting, but local police said the journalist was killed by Russian forces. Renaud, who was 50, “paid with his life for attempting to expose the insidiousness, cruelty and ruthlessness of the aggressor,” Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, said in a statement reported by The New York Times. Renaud’s death signals a grim milestone for reporters covering Vladimir Putin’s worsening war against Ukraine, as he appears to be the first foreign journalist killed in the conflict. Earlier this month, a Ukrainian cameraman was killed during the shelling of a Kyiv-based TV tower.

The other reporter, identified by The Guardian as photographer Juan Arredondo, gave an interview from his hospital bed in the midst of being treated by health workers. In the video, Arredondo said they came under Russian fire as they passed through a checkpoint in Irpin. He said Renaud had been shot in the neck but that they were separated at the scene and did not know what state his reporting partner was in.

The details of the shooting remained unclear as word of the attack spread Sunday. The Committee to Protect Journalists said it was “unable to immediately confirm the source of the gunfire.” AFP, a Paris-based global news agency, reported that the “exact circumstances were unclear” but that AFP reporters in Irpin “saw the body of the victim” and that a third victim, a Ukrainian who had been in the same car as the U.S. journalists, was also injured. “The car was shot at. There were two journalists and one of ours [a Ukrainian],” Danylo Shapovalov, a surgeon volunteering for the Ukrainian territorial defense, told the outlet. Shapovalov said Renaud “died immediately” and that he had provided first aid to the other two victims.

Renaud was initially mistaken as a correspondent for the Times due to a press badge he was found with, a photograph of which was included in a Facebook post published by Kyiv Regional Police Chief Andriy Nebitov. The post also included a graphic photo purportedly of Renaud’s body, as well as a picture of his passport. The Times was quick to issue a statement clarifying the early reports, saying that while Renaud was “a talented filmmaker who had contributed to The New York Times over the years,” most recently in 2015, “he was not on assignment for any desk at The Times in Ukraine.” The press badge he was found with, the paper said, “had been issued for an assignment many years ago.”

CPJ called for justice in a statement decrying the shooting. “We are shocked and saddened to learn of the death of U.S. journalist Brent Renaud in Ukraine. This kind of attack is totally unacceptable, and is a violation of international law,” said Carlos Martinez de la Serna, CPJ’s program director, in New York. “Russian forces in Ukraine must stop all violence against journalists and other civilians at once, and whoever killed Renaud should be held to account.”

Renaud, whose work covered the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and cartel violence in Mexico, was working on a global film project about refugees, according to journalist Simon Ostrovsky.

Update from the four major axes:

Kyiv (north): Not much, Russians “regrouping.” Honestly, not sure what they’re “regrouping,” as recent forays have been anemic in scope. Russia continues to be unable to mount any serious attack. They were silent on the northwest approach (though Ukraine claims to have been quite active), and engaged only in “limited” incursion on the northeastern approach. Looks like that northeastern incursion suffered some loses:

Russians clearly don’t have manpower to mount a serious assault on the city of 2.9 million. Their goal may simply be to get artillery close enough to pull a Kherson or Mariupol—indiscriminate shelling of civilians in an attempt to terrorize Ukraine into submission. The ubiquitous GRAD MLRS rocket artillery systems have a maximum range of 21 kms, which right now only reaches some of the outer suburbs. Continuing to keep them out of range is a top Ukrainian defensive priority.

Kharkiv/Sumy (northeast):

The map hasn’t changed. The Institute of War recaps, “Russian forces did not secure any new territory in northeastern Ukraine and may be redeploying forces attacking eastern Kyiv to defend against Ukrainian counterattacks in Sumy Oblast.” Previous days brought reports that Russian troops encircling Kharkiv had also been pulled to help with securing those lines.

Remember, Russia doesn’t have that many troops. 190,000 sounds like a lot, but only a small percent of those actually shoot anything—the vast majority are support (truck drivers, supply, mechanics, medics, command and control, fuel, etc). Then, spread them out along four major axes, and over a dozen lines of attack, and suddenly things don’t look so daunting. It can’t be stated enough—this is the reason Russia is trying to terrorize Ukraine into submission. They just don’t have the forces to actually win on the battlefield.

So they have to pull forces from Kyiv axis and the siege of Kharkiv, but not for new offensive efforts, or to finally take Sumy and secure that territory. But to protect their lines.

Let me stress that: They’re taking precious troops away from the sieges of both Kyiv and Kharkiv, just to guard their supplies, lest, they keep suffering more of this:

x #Ukraine: Apparently yesterday, vehicles left behind by Russian forces scatter the road to Slatyne, #Kharkiv Oblast, likely already looted.

So if they can’t secure their lines, how are they going to actually take on cities with hundreds of thousands to millions of pissed off, motivated defenders? On top of that, they’re suffering serious battlefield casualties.

No more reinforcements are coming from Russia, at least not anytime soon. Meanwhile, replacing dead and injured Russians with low-quality Belorussian or Syrian mercenaries with no real skin in the game won’t fix their problems. That’s just more bodies to equip, feed, fuel, and supply, but with fewer support troops and no experience integrating into Russian operations. (Though honestly, that might not be a bad thing now that I think about it...)

Donbas (east): Mariupol, on the far southeastern corner of Ukraine, is surrounded, under massive bombardment, running out of food, no electricity, and it’s still holding on. Russia did make a move on the city’s western edge.

They look like they’re downright having fun, instead of being trapped in what might be the most hellish place on the planet right now. But here’s the thing, by all indications this was a few armored vehicles, pushed back with relative ease. Russia is still unable to bring massive force to an objective. Imagine a wave of 2-3,000 infantrymen, supported by armor, artillery, and air support. The fact that Russia can’t manage to send more than a few hundred men into battle at any one time continues to confirm Russia’s inability to coordinate combined-arms actions.

As a result of their shocking ineptitude, a big chunk of Russia’s already thin forces are stuck in a corner that should’ve long-ago been secured. Those are troops that can’t work to encircle Ukrainian defenders on the separatist Donbas border, and they can’t help secure supply lines supporting the siege of Kyiv. I almost wrote “and they can’t help take Sumy or Kharkiv,” but given how inept they’ve been outside Mariupol, I doubt anything can help Russia take those cities.

Crimea/Kherson (south): IFW writes, “Russian advances from Crimea toward Mykolayiv and Zaporizhya and in the east around Donetsk and Luhansk made no progress in the last 24 hours.”

Mykolayiv is on the Southern Bug river, and all crossings are all solidly in Ukrainian hands. Russia has solidified its hold on Kherson, but supply lines from there to Mykolayiv are 72 km long (~40 miles), and Ukraine territorial defense forces are actively harassing those lines.

So stop me if you’ve heard this story before—Russian advances are stalled because of logistical problems. Instead, Mykolayiv is being leveled by Russian artillery.

Elsewhere, I never bought into predictions that Belarus would enter the war, opening up a new front in western Ukraine. How could they? You think Russian troops are bad, Belarusian ones would be exponentially worse. And they were then supposed to maintain yet another line of supply?

A barrage of Russian missiles hit Ukraine’s Yavoriv International Centre for Peacekeeping and Security, a base just 25 km from the Polish border that has previously hosted NATO military instructors, killing 35 people and wounding 134, a Ukrainian official said on Sunday.

Russia’s defence ministry said up to 180 “foreign mercenaries” and a large number of foreign weapons were destroyed. Reuters could not independently verify the casualties reported by either side.

Thousands of people have died since 24 February, when Russian President Vladimir Putin launched what he called a special military operation to rid Ukraine of “dangerous nationalists and Nazis”.

The United States, which had watched Russia’s build-up on Ukraine’s borders with mounting alarm for weeks, says it was a premeditated, unjustified and unlawful “war of choice”.

In a telephone call, US President Joe Biden and France’s Emmanuel Macron underscored their commitment to holding Russia accountable for the invasion, the White House said.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, also discussed diplomatic efforts to stop Russia’s invasion, the State Department said.

Hopes were boosted after Russia and Ukraine gave their most upbeat assessments after weekend negotiations.

“Russia is already beginning to talk constructively,” Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak said in a video online. “I think that we will achieve some results literally in a matter of days.”

To clarify. At the negotiations, the RF not putting ultimatums, but carefully listens to our proposals. 🇺🇦 will not give up any of the positions.

A Russian delegate to the talks, Leonid Slutsky, was quoted by the RIA news agency as saying they had made significant progress and it was possible the delegations could soon reach draft agreements.

Neither side said what these would cover. Three rounds of talks between the two sides in Belarus, most recently last Monday, had focused mainly on humanitarian issues.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the countries’ delegations have been speaking daily by video link and a clear aim of his negotiators was to “do everything” to arrange for him to meet Putin.

“We must hold on. We must fight. And we will win,” Zelenskyy said in a late night video speech.

Harsh sanctions

Global financial markets, battered by fears the conflict could spread and drag in NATO, rallied on hopes for progress in peace talks. Stocks rose while oil prices gave up some of their massive recent gains.

Western nations have sought to isolate Putin by imposing harsh economic sanctions and supplying Ukraine with weapons.

Increasingly isolated, Russia asked China for military equipment after its invasion, sparking concern in the White House that Beijing may undermine Western efforts to help Ukrainian forces defend their country, several US officials said.

US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, who is due to meet China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi in Rome on Monday, warned Beijing it would “absolutely” face consequences if it helped Moscow evade sanctions.

US warns China against ‘backfilling’ sanction-hit Russia Russia said on Sunday (13 March) that it was counting on China to help it withstand the blow to its economy from Western sanctions over the war in Ukraine, but the United States warned Beijing not to provide that lifeline.

Asked about Russia’s request for military aid, Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for China’s embassy in Washington, said, “I’ve never heard of that.”

He said China found the current situation in Ukraine “disconcerting” and added, “We support and encourage all efforts that are conducive to a peaceful settlement of the crisis.”

Still, violence and bloodshed continued.

Air raid sirens sounded before dawn in many cities and regions of Ukraine, including Kyiv, Lviv, Odessa, Ivano-Frankivsk and Cherkasy.

In the capital, authorities said they were stockpiling two weeks’ worth of food for the 2 million people who have not yet fled from Russian forces attempting to encircle the city.

An American journalist was shot and killed by Russian forces in the town of Irpin, northwest of Kyiv, and another journalist was wounded, the regional police chief said.

Britain’s defence ministry said Russian naval forces had established a distant blockade of Ukraine’s Black Sea coast, isolating the country from international maritime trade.

In eastern Ukraine, Russian troops were trying to surround Ukrainian forces as they advance from the port of Mariupol in the south and the second city Kharkiv in the north, it added.

The Russian-controlled eastern city of Donbas and Crimea – which was seized by Russia in 2014 – are now connected by a road controlled by pro-Russian forces, Russia’s RIA news agency quoted Georgy Muradov, the deputy prime minister of the Russian-backed government in Crimea, as saying.

The report could not be independently confirmed.

Russia’s invasion has sent more than 2.5 million people fleeing across Ukraine’s borders and trapped hundreds of thousands in besieged cities.

“It is terrifying how violent and inhuman it is,” Olga, a refugee from Kyiv, told Reuters after crossing into Romania.

The United Nations says at least 596 civilians have died since the invasion began and the toll is probably considerably higher as it is difficult to confirm deaths in places such as Mariupol.

The city council in Mariupol said 2,187 residents had been killed since the start of the invasion. Reuters was not able to verify that toll.

Moscow denies targeting civilians. It blames Ukraine for failed attempts to evacuate civilians from encircled cities, an accusation Ukraine and its Western allies strongly reject.

Kharkiv, in northeastern Ukraine, has suffered some of the heaviest bombardment and dozens of civilians have been killed.

“We will stitch up the wounds and the pain of our country and our city,” said Aliev, a 23-year-old musician. “We’re not going anywhere.”",https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/more-ukraine-russia-talks-scheduled-after-deadly-attack-on-base-near-polish-border/

More than 2,000 people have died in the city of Mariupol since Russia launched its war in Ukraine, the city council has said, as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) warned that residents of the besieged port city face a “a worst-case scenario” unless the warring parties reach an agreement to ensure their immediate safety and access to humanitarian aid.

“To date, 2,187 Mariupol residents have died from attacks by Russia,” the Mariupol local council said on its official Telegram account on Sunday. Since the war in Ukraine began on February 24, it added, Russian forces have dropped about 100 bombs on the city, including 22 in the previous 24 hours.

Ukrainian authorities say the city has been subject to relentless bombardment since Russian troops surrounded it on March 2. Since then, the roughly 400,000 people who remain in Mariupol have been left with no access to water, food and medicine. Heat, phone services – and electricity in many areas – have been cut.

“The situation is catastrophic; it has been catastrophic for days,” the ICRC’s Jason Straziuso told Al Jazeera. “Even our team is collecting water from streams … but how does everyone do that … especially if you are elderly?” he asked. Straziuso said that his team members were eating one meal per day.

In a statement later on Sunday, the ICRC warned that time was “running out” for those trapped in the city.

“History will look back at what is now happening in Mariupol with horror if no agreement is reached by the sides as quickly as possible.”

ICRC president Peter Maurer called on all parties involved in the fighting to “place humanitarian imperatives first”.

The ICRC said “a concrete, precise, actionable agreement” was needed without delay so civilians wanting to leave can reach safety, and life-saving aid can reach those who stay.

Moscow has repeatedly justified its offensive in Ukraine, saying that it was conducting a “special military operation” attacking military targets. Last week though, Kyiv accused Russia of bombing a children’s hospital and a maternity ward and killing three people, while Mariupol’s local authorities on Thursday reported that city’s residential areas had been shelled “every 30 minutes”.

The capture of the port city is strategically important to Moscow as it would link Russian-backed territories in the east with Russian-annexed Crimea in the south.

Several attempts to establish evacuation corridors to allow civilians to escape the city, and to allow humanitarian aid to enter, have fallen apart as previously agreed ceasefires collapsed.

Ukrainian authorities have accused Russia of deliberately opening fire on aid convoys heading towards Mariupol. Russia has blamed Kyiv for sabotaging ceasefire agreements.

On Sunday, another attempt was under way as Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that a convoy with humanitarian aid was two hours away from Mariupol.

“We’re doing everything to counter occupiers who are even blocking Orthodox priests accompanying this aid, food, water and medicine. There are 100 tonnes of the most necessary things that Ukraine sent to its citizens,” Zelenskyy said in a video address.

The president also said that nearly 125,000 civilians from other cities have been evacuated through safe-passage corridors in one day.

Amid collapsed ceasefires and trade accusations, Mikhail Podolyak, a member of the Ukrainian negotiating team, said on Sunday that there has been some progress in the talks with his team’s Russian counterparts.

L'espoir d'un cessez-le-feu? Plus de deux semaines après le début de la guerre en Ukraine lancée par la Russie, une nouvelle phase de négociations aura lieu ce lundi. À partir de 10 heures, des responsables des deux parties vont pouvoir discuter par visio-conférence, comme l'a précisé dimanche soir un membre de la délégation ukrainienne, David Arakhamia.

Après l'échec des trois premières sessions de pourparlers en Biélorussie, puis de la rencontre jeudi en Turquie entre les ministres des Affaires étrangères des deux pays, la donne pourrait être différente.

La Russie ""écoute attentivement"" l'Ukraine

Dimanche soir, un négociateur russe faisait état de ""progrès significatifs"".

""Mon attente personnelle est que ces progrès aboutissent très prochainement à une position commune entre les deux délégations et à des documents à signer"", a ajouté Léonid Sloutski, cité par les agences de presse russes.

Peu après, Mykhaïlo Podoliak, conseiller du président ukrainien Volodymyr Zelensky, a tweeté que Moscou avait cessé de lancer ""des ultimatums"" à Kiev et commencé à ""écouter attentivement nos propositions"".

Deux déclarations empreintes d'optimisme qui font écho à celles des deux présidents les jours précédents, Vladimir Poutine évoquant vendredi ""des avancées positives"" dans les pourparlers et Volodymyr Zelensky notant le lendemain une ""approche fondamentalement différente"" de Moscou dans ces discussions.

Zelensky avait précisé dimanche que sa délégation avait ""une tâche claire: tout faire pour assurer une rencontre des présidents. Une réunion que les gens attendent, j'en suis sûr"".

Le bilan humain s'alourdit

Sur le terrain, l'urgence d'un cessez-le-feu se fait sentir. Des milliers de militaires ont perdu la vie depuis près de vingt jours: Kiev faisait état samedi d'""environ 1300"" soldats ukrainiens tués, et Moscou de 498 morts dans ses rangs (unique bilan côté russe, annoncé le 2 mars), alors que le Pentagone parlait de 2000 à 4000 morts russes en 14 jours.

NATO planners are updating the US “nuclear sharing” program to account for most

European allies planning to buy F-35 joint strike fighter jets, the military bloc’s director of nuclear policy said this week. Lockheed Martin’s fifth-generation fighter has been embraced by multiple US allies, including most recently Germany, despite the Pentagon’s own misgivings about the program.“We’re moving fast and furiously towards F-35 modernization and incorporating those into our planning and into our exercising and things like that as those capabilities come online,” Jessica Cox, director of the NATO nuclear policy directorate in Brussels, said on Wednesday, adding that “By the end of the decade, most if not all of our allies will have transitioned” to the F-35.Cox spoke during an online discussion hosted by the Advanced Nuclear Weapons Alliance Deterrence Center (ANWA DC), a US think tank, according to Defense News.Her remarks come a month after Berlin said Germany would replace its aging Tornado jets with F-35s, committing to buy up to three dozen and specifically citing the nuclear sharing mission as factoring in the decision.Cox said that other NATO allies currently operating the F-35, such as Poland, Denmark, and Norway, might be asked to support nuclear sharing missions in the future, adding that NATO “will also have some operational advantages with the F-35 since there will be opportunities for enhanced networking and integration across the force.”In addition to Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, and Turkey are currently hosting an estimated 150 US nuclear weapons – mainly B-61 gravity bombs, intended to be carried by smaller fighter-bombers like the Tornado or the F-16 – according to estimates by British think tank Chatham House.Finland and Sweden have recently voiced a desire to join NATO, and Helsinki already announced it would buy some 60 F-35s in early February. Russia has responded by saying it would be forced to reposition some of its troops and nuclear deterrent accordingly.The US first deployed some of its nuclear bombs in Europe in the 1960s. Ending this program was high on the list of security demands Moscow presented to the US and NATO in December 2021, which were rejected in January – a month before the escalation of hostilities in Ukraine.Russia launched its military offensive in Ukraine on February 24, following Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the 2014 German and French-brokered Minsk Protocol, designed to give the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. Moscow has now recognized the Donbass republics as independent states, and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc.The F-35 was originally proposed as a cost-effective modular design that could replace multiple older models in service with the US Air Force, Navy, and the Marines. In reality, it turned into three distinct designs with a lifetime project cost of over $1.7 trillion, the most expensive weapons program in US history.In addition to the price tag, the fifth-generation stealth fighter has also been plagued with performance issues, to the point where the new USAF chief of staff requested a study into a different aircraft in February 2021.General Charles Q. Brown Jr. compared the F-35 to a “high end” sports car, a Ferrari one drives on Sundays only, and sought proposals for a “clean sheet design” of a “5th-gen minus” workhorse jet instead. Multiple US outlets characterized his proposal as a “tacit admission” that the F-35 program had failed.",https://vk.com/wall267893108?offset=100

A recent controversial Johns Hopkins meta-analysis reignites a discussion about the adverse consequences of lockdowns after finding they had no significant mortality benefit during the first wave of the 2020 pandemic in the United States and Europe, according to a recent report .

“We find no evidence that lockdowns, school closures, border closures, and limiting gatherings have had a noticeable effect on COVID-19 mortality,” said the authors of the study, which is not peer-reviewed and reflects the authors’ views, not necessarily those of the university .

The study authors, however, did find closing nonessential businesses reduced COVID-19 mortality by 10.6%, which is likely most related to the closure of bars .

‘SHOULD BE REJECTED OUT OF HAND’: LOCKDOWNS ONLY REDUCED COVID DEATH RATE BY .2%, STUDY FINDS

“Our study shows the benefits [of lockdowns] — in terms of fewer deaths — are questionable and small,” Jonas Herby, special advisor at the Center for Political Studies in Copenhagen, Denmark, told Fox News. Herby’s research focuses on law and economics, and he is a co-author of the study.

The meta-analysis – a survey or study of previous studies – which Herby wrote along with two other prominent economists, noted lockdowns have had “devastating effects” as society weathers the unintended consequences.

“They have contributed to reducing economic activity, rising unemployment, reducing schooling, causing political unrest, contributing to domestic violence, and undermining liberal democracy,” the report noted .

The research directly contradicts the most influential model for lockdowns led by epidemiologist Neil Ferguson, which was largely responsible for “driving the world’s response to COVID-19” that “jarred the U.S. and the U.K. to action,” according to The Wall Street Journal .

Ferguson co-wrote a prominent paper in Nature published in June 2020 that estimated lockdowns in the spring of that year saved three million European lives. But the study excluded the research because it relied on modeling, according to multiple reports .

“This report on the effect of ‘lockdowns’ does not significantly advance our understanding of the relative effectiveness of the plethora of public health measures adopted by different countries to limit COVID-19 transmission,” Ferguson posted on Science Media Centre , a United Kingdom liaison of information for science and health journalists.

Ferguson resigned his government post on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies in May 2020 after breaking lockdown protocol himself when his lover, Antonia Staats, crossed London from her family home to visit him on at least two occasions while lockdown measures were imposed, according to the Guardian.

MAJOR MEDIA IGNORE STUDY FINDING COVID LOCKDOWNS INEFFECTIVE

The Johns Hopkins researchers acknowledged a limitation of the study was excluding certain studies like Ferguson’s to avoid biases, such as those brought on by “time-dependent factors” like seasonality. So papers that looked at early lockdowns such as in China, which suppressed COVID-19 to very low death rates, were also not included, according to a United Kingdom report .

Nevertheless, lockdown proponents are now weathering the aftershocks that persist after the lockdowns have been lifted, according to multiple reports.

“There are long-term health consequences from the virus, including long COVID, and there are long-term mental health impacts from the death due to COVID-19 of a parent, spouse, grandparent, caregiver,” said Dr. Julie Vaishampayan, chair of the public health committee for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

“There are long-term health impacts of the measures used to slow down the spread of this virus.”

By the end of June 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that, due to COVID-19 concerns, approximately 41% of United States adults delayed or avoided medical care, including 12% who avoided urgent or emergency care and 32% who neglected routine care. Those findings noted a higher prevalence among people with multiple medical problems, Black and Hispanic adults, young adults, and persons with disabilities, according to a past Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report .

Even though most students are now back in school, many now struggle academically from the consequences of months of online learning, while some others opted to switch schools or even drop out, according to a recent New York Times report .

The Times also noted that students continue to have persistent feelings of loneliness and anxiety with the sense that the system has failed them and created responsibilities that are not typically expected of them .

“Today’s kids will have to shoulder this burden along with diminished skills, thanks to the distance-learning disaster demanded by so many so-called experts in public health,” said James Freeman, assistant editor of The Wall Street Journal’s editorial page, a Fox News contributor and frequent host of “Deep Dive” on Fox Nation .

The New England Journal of Medicine reviewed the psychological impact of people in quarantine, finding “numerous emotional outcomes, including stress, depression, irritability, insomnia, fear, confusion, anger, frustration, boredom and stigma associated with quarantine, some of which persisted after the quarantine was lifted .”

“The president has been clear that we are not pushing lockdowns, we have not been pro-lockdown, that has not been his agenda,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said when asked about the Johns Hopkins paper at a recent press briefing .

“Most of the lockdowns happened under the previous president. What our objective has been is to convey we have the tools we need to keep our country open.”

“We need strong, accurate data on all these long-term effects to best balance the response measures, ensuring the best possible outcome,” Vaishampayan added.

An American journalist was killed in Ukraine when he and a colleague came under fire near the capital, Kyiv, regional police and a government official have said.

Russian troops opened fire on the car of Brent Renaud and another journalist in Irpin, about 10km (6 miles) northwest of the capital, the Kyiv police force said in a statement on Sunday. It said the injured journalist was taken to a hospital in Kyiv.

The adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, Anton Herashchenko, confirmed the incident on a Telegram channel.

There was no immediate comment from the Russian authorities.

The journalist being treated at the hospital said he and a colleague were shot after they were stopped at a checkpoint just after a bridge in Irpin.

Juan Arredondo told Italian journalist Annalisa Camilli in an interview from the hospital before being taken for surgery that the colleague who was with him was hit in the neck and remained on the ground earlier on Sunday.

Camilli told The Associated Press news agency that she was at the hospital when Arredondo arrived and that Arredondo himself had been wounded, hit in the lower back when stopped at a Russian checkpoint.

He told Camilli that he and Renaud were filming refugees fleeing the area when they were shot at while in a car approaching a checkpoint. The driver turned around but the firing at them continued, Arredondo added.

Arredondo said an ambulance took him to the hospital and that Renaud was “left behind”.

The New York Times, responding to reports that Renaud was a reporter for the paper, said he had previously worked for it but had not been on assignment for the Times in Ukraine.

“We are deeply saddened to hear of Brent Renaud’s death,” a spokesperson for the paper said on Twitter, naming the journalist thought to have been killed.

Hall has been hospitalized with injuries, but no further updates have been given on his condition. Fox News Media CEO Suzanne Scott said in a statement that the company was working to gather additional details and added, “Please keep Ben and his family in your prayers.”

“This is a stark reminder for all journalists who are putting their lives on the line every day to deliver the news from a war zone,” she said.

An American journalist, who said he was in a car with Renaud when the two were shot at near a military checkpoint, was hurt and transported to a Kyiv hospital. Juan Arredondo told Italian news outlet Internazionale from the hospital that Renaud was “shot in the neck” and “left behind.”

Arredondo said he and Renaud were headed to film people evacuating Irpin when someone offered to drive them to a bridge used by refugees. “We crossed the checkpoint, and they start shooting at us,” he told Italian journalist Annalisa Camilli. “The driver turned around, and they kept shooting.”

The circumstances surrounding the incident could not be independently verified. Kyiv regional police chief Andriy Nebitov blamed the shooting on Russian forces.

Nebitov said on Facebook that Renaud paid with his life for trying to show the “cruelty and ruthlessness” of the Russian invaders.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has put particular pressure on domestic and international news organizations, which have had to weigh the safety of their journalists against the need to cover events on the ground. The New York Times last week became the first major American news organization to announce it will pull its staff out of Russia in response to the country’s increasing crackdown on journalism.

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CBS News’s Margaret Brennan on Sunday that Renaud’s death was “shocking and horrifying.” Without mentioning Renaud by name, Sullivan said, “We’ll be consulting with the Ukrainians to determine how this happened and then to measure and execute appropriate consequences as a result of it.”

White House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked Monday how the Biden administration would respond to the death of Renaud. “In terms of next steps or what the next consequence would be, I don’t have anything to preview for you at this point in time,” she said.

Renaud’s death prompted an outpouring of grief and outrage among his friends, colleagues and free-press advocacy organizations.

Renaud was an award-winning journalist and documentarian who filmed in conflict zones around the world. He was remembered by those who knew him as an empathetic and courageous person who risked his life over and over to report on veterans, migrants and drug addicts — vulnerable people whose stories he told with candor and an eye for truth, his friend and colleague Christof Putzel told The Washington Post on Sunday.

“It’s such a loss, not just for me, his family, but it’s a loss to our profession,” he said.

Renaud had an “innate humanity and empathy that allowed him to connect with people,” Putzel said. “Nothing was more important to him than the truth and the story, and that is why he put his life on the line constantly.”

Renaud was reporting on the global refugee crisis for Time Studios when he was killed, according to a statement from Edward Felsenthal, Time magazine’s editor in chief and CEO. “Our hearts are with all of Brent’s loved ones,” Felsenthal said. “It is essential that journalists are able to safely cover this ongoing invasion and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.”

A tribute to Renaud’s work published by the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University, where he was a fellow in 2019, states that “if there’s even a single thing about Sunday that makes any sense, it’s that Brent Renaud died telling the stories of people caught up in some of humanity’s darkest situations.”

Zelensky also praised Renaud’s “courage and determination” on Monday. “He traveled to the most dangerous war zones to film the unprecedented truthfulness and evil, also inflicted upon our nation by the aggressor state,” the Ukrainian leader wrote in his letter.

“May Brent’s life, service and sacrifice inspire generations of people all around the world to stand up in fight for the forces of light against the forces of darkness.”

Brent Renaud, a former New York Times journalist, fell to his death after he was shot in the neck by the troops, in Irpen near the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv.

However, his friend managed to survive the attack and is currently undergoing treatment at the hospital in Ukraine.

“We crossed the first bridge in Irpen and were going to film other refugees leaving. We got into a car somebody offered to take us to the other bridges.

While confirming and expressing grief over Renaud’s death, the deputy managing editor of the NYT Cliff Levy, said that the former was an ex-NYT reporter but had not been assigned to the job in Ukraine.

“NYT is deeply saddened to learn of the death of an American journalist in Ukraine, Brent Renaud. Brent was a talented photographer and filmmaker, but he was not on assignment for @nytimes in Ukraine. Full statement is here,” he tweeted.

A photo of the statement by the NYT was attached to the tweet.

The statement clarified that Renaud was a former correspondent who last worked on an assignment for the NYT in 2015.

“Early reports that he worked for The Times circulated as he was wearing a Times press badge that had been issued for an assignment many years ago,” read the statement.

“Brent’s death is a terrible loss. Brave journalists like Brent take tremendous risks to bear witness and to tell the world about the devastation and suffering caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” tweeted Levy.

The police force said on Sunday on its official website that Russian troops opened fire on the car of Brent Renaud and another journalist in Irpin near the capital. It said the injured journalist was being taken to a hospital in Kyiv.

A New York Times spokesperson said Renaud, 50, was a “talented filmmaker who had contributed to The New York Times over the years.” It said he was not working for the publication at the time of his death.

The police force said: “Of course, the profession of journalism carries risks. Nonetheless, U.S. citizen Brent Renaud paid with his life trying to highlight the deceit, cruelty and ruthlessness of the aggressor.”

Award-winning American journalist Brent Renaud was killed by Russian forces in Irpin, Ukraine, according to Kyiv region police in social media posts on Sunday. Kyiv police said another American journalist was wounded by Russian troops.

In a tweet, Kyiv region police named the 50-year-old American journalist who was killed as Brent Renaud. Police posted a photo of his body and his American passport as evidence, as well as a photo of an outdated New York Times press badge with Brent Renaud's name.

An adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, Anton Gerashchenko, said in a statement that Renaud “paid with his life for attempting to expose the insidiousness, cruelty and ruthlessness of the aggressor,"" according to a New York Times report.

CNN has been unable to verify which media outlet the American journalists were working for in Ukraine.

The New York Times said in a statement on Sunday, ""We are deeply saddened to hear of Brent Renaud’s death. Brent was a talented filmmaker who had contributed to The New York Times over the years. Though he had contributed to The Times in the past (most recently in 2015), he was not on assignment for any desk at The Times in Ukraine. Early reports that he worked for Times circulated because he was wearing a Times press badge that had been issued for an assignment many years ago.""

Some more context: The northern Ukrainian city of Irpin, just outside Kyiv, has been the site of substantial Russian shelling in recent days and has seen extensive destruction, according to the Kyiv regional government on Friday.

Brent Renaud was a Peabody Award-winning documentary filmmaker, producer, and journalist, who lived and worked in New York City and Little Rock, Arkansas, according to his biography on the Renaud Brothers website.

With his brother Craig, Renaud spent years ""telling humanistic verite stories from the World's hot spots,"" including projects in Iraq, Afghanistan, Haiti, Egypt, and Libya, according to his website bio. Brent Renaud was a 2019 Harvard Nieman Fellow.

Christof Putzel, a friend and colleague of Renaud, told CNN his passing is a ""devastating loss to journalism today.""

""I woke up this morning to the news that Brent, long-time best friend, incredible colleague, the best war journalist I think ever existed, finding out about his passing. Brent had this ability to go anywhere, get any story, listen and communicate what was happening to people that others wouldn't otherwise see it. And it is a devastating loss to journalism today,"" Putzel told Brian Stelter on CNN's Reliable Sources Sunday.

Putzel said Renaud was working on a documentary about refugees around the world when the crisis in Ukraine hit. He said that ""Brent was on the plane the next day"" and covered the plight of refugees from Kyiv into Poland. A post on the Renaud Brothers' Facebook page, dated March 8, urged readers to follow their coverage of the war Ukraine.

Several years ago, Putzel and Renaud won a duPont Award for a story they worked on about guns being smuggled into Mexico from the US. ""What I said when we accepted our award was, the only thing bigger than Brent's balls are his heart. And I stand by that. That's what kind of journalist he was,"" Putzel said.

He said Renaud had a unique ability to make people trust him as he told their stories in places like Iraq and other war zones. ""You could sit down and spend a week watching all of Brent's stories over the years back-to-back and just be flabbergasted. The career that he had, his ability to reach people, his ability to capture the humanity behind people's suffering is something I have never seen before, and I was just honored to work with him as long as I did,"" Putzel said.

The director of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard said on Sunday that the foundation is ""heartsick"" over the death of American journalist Brent Renaud in Ukraine.

""Our Nieman Fellow Brent Renaud was gifted and kind, and his work was infused with humanity. He was killed today outside Kiev, and the world and journalism are lesser for it. We are heartsick,"" said foundation curator Ann Marie Lipinski in a tweet.

The Committee to Protect Journalists on Sunday condemned the killing of Renaud and called for the killers to be brought to justice.

The New York-based organization said in a statement, ""U.S. reporter Brent Renaud was shot and killed, and another journalist was injured on Sunday in the city of Irpin, outside of Kyiv, according to a Ukrainian police official and news reports. In denouncing the shooting, the Committee to Protect Journalists called for the killers to be brought to justice.""

“We are shocked and saddened to learn of the death of U.S. journalist Brent Renaud in Ukraine.

A US journalist was shot dead and another wounded on Sunday in Irpin, a frontline suburb of Kyiv that has witnessed some of the fiercest fighting since Russia invaded Ukraine.

Papers found on the American reporter's body identified him as 50-year-old video documentary shooter Brent Renaud, of New York.

A New York Times identity card was among the papers, leading to reports he worked for the paper, but the US daily said he was not working for it at the time of his death.

The International Federation of Journalists identified the wounded reporter as American photographer Juan Arredondo.

A third victim, a Ukrainian who had been in the same car as the Americans, was also wounded, according to a medic at the scene.

AFP reporters in Irpin saw Ukrainian volunteer soldiers rush the body on a stretcher to a more secure location before laying it out on the ground for further identification.

Danylo Shapovalov, a surgeon volunteering for the Ukrainian territorial defence, said Renaud died instantly from a gunshot wound to his neck.

Ukrainian officials were quick to blame Russian forces for the shooting but the exact circumstances were unclear.

AFP reporters heard small arms and artillery fire in the area, which runs along the front splitting Ukrainian positions from advancing Russian forces

""The car was shot at. There were two journalists and one of ours,"" Shapovalov told AFP.

""Our guy and the journalist are wounded, I provided them first aid, the other one received a wound in the neck, he died immediately.""

'They kept shooting'

The New York Times called Renaud ""a talented photographer and filmmaker"" who last contributed to the paper in 2015.

""He was not on assignment for any desk at The Times in Ukraine,"" said a statement tweeted by deputy managing editor Cliff Levy.

Arredondo said in a news video shot of him in his hospital bed that the reporters' vehicle came under attack after crossing a Ukrainian-controlled checkpoint.

""We were going to film other refugees leaving. We got into a car, someone offered to take us to the other bridge,"" he said.

""We crossed a checkpoint and they started shooting at us, so the driver turned around and they kept shooting.""

Ukrainian officials immediately blamed Russian forces for the attack, which occurred near a bridge leading from Irpin to the flashpoint town of Bucha, now under Russian control.

White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said US officials would consult with Kyiv to determine the circumstances of the attack.

""We'll be consulting with the Ukrainians to determine how this happened and then to measure and execute appropriate consequences as a result of it,"" Sullivan told CBS television.

Renaud won Harvard University's Nieman Fellowship in 2019, which he used to report on a wide range of global issues, including Black Lives Matter protests in his native Little Rock, Arkansas.

His other work included an HBO documentary on heroin addiction and reports on Africa and the Middle East, according to his official Nieman biography.

Renaud becomes the first foreign reporter killed in Ukraine since the Russian assault began on February 24.

A Ukrainian journalist died during a Russian missile strike aimed at Kyiv's television tower, which killed five people walking in the area on March 1.

Security camera footage verified by The New York Times showed a building ablaze inside the Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex near a line of military vehicles. The videos appeared to show people in the vehicles firing at buildings in the power plant. Ukraine’s state emergency service later said the blaze went out after 6 a.m.

The fire did not affect essential equipment at the plant, the International Atomic Energy Agency said on Twitter, citing its communication with the Ukrainian government.

About an hour after dawn, Ukraine’s nuclear regulatory inspectorate said in a statement that Russian military forces were now occupying the complex. It said that all of the site’s power units remained intact and that no changes in radiation levels had been observed.

The fire broke out after a Russian attack on a training building outside the perimeter of the plant, according to a statement by Ukraine’s state emergency service. A spokesman for the nuclear plant, Andriy Tuz, was quoted by The Associated Press as telling Ukrainian television that shells had set fire to one of the plant’s six reactors that was under renovation and not operating.

Ukraine’s nuclear inspectorate later said in its statement that one unit of the six units was operating, another was in “outage,” two were being cooled down, and two others had been disconnected from the grid.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine had accused the Russian military of deliberately attacking the complex and said an explosion there would have been “the end for everybody, the end of Europe.”

“Only immediate actions by Europe could stop the Russian army,” he added.

President Biden spoke with Mr. Zelensky about the fire and joined him in urging Russia to “cease its military activities in the area and allow firefighters and emergency responders to access the site,” the White House said. Local reports later said that emergency crews had gained access.

Mr. Biden’s energy secretary, Jennifer M. Granholm, said on Twitter that the United States had not detected elevated radiation readings in the area, echoing an earlier assessment by the International Atomic Energy Agency. “The plant’s reactors are protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down,” she said.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain said he would seek an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council about the blaze at the complex, according to his office.

Before the fire was reported by Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, the director general for the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement that “a large number of Russian tanks and infantry” had entered Enerhodar, a town next to the plant. The director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said that troops were “moving directly” toward the reactor site.

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex, on the Dnieper River roughly a hundred miles north of Crimea, is the largest in Europe. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, its six reactors produce a total of 6,000 megawatts of electric power.

In comparison, the Chernobyl plant in northern Ukraine produced 3,800 megawatts — about a third less. (A megawatt, one million watts, is enough power to light 10,000 hundred-watt bulbs.) The four reactors of the Chernobyl complex were shut down after one suffered a catastrophic fire and meltdown in 1986.

The reactors’ cores are full of highly radioactive fuel. But an additional danger at the Zaporizhzhia site is the many acres of open pools of water behind the complex where spent fuel rods have been cooled for years. Experts fear that errant shells or missiles that hit such sites could set off radiological disasters.

For days, social media reports have detailed how the residents of Enerhodar set up a giant barrier of tires, vehicles and metal barricades to try to block a Russian advance into the city and the reactor site. Christoph Koettl, a visual investigator for The New York Times, noted on Twitter that the barricades were so large that they could be seen from outer space by orbiting satellites.

Starting this past Sunday, three days into the invasion, Ukraine’s nuclear regulator began reporting an unusual rate of disconnection: Six of the nation’s 15 reactors were offline. On Tuesday, the Zaporizhzhia facility was the site with the most reactors offline.

Local government officials in this city in southern Ukraine, which has been controlled by Russian troops for the past two weeks, have been kicked out of their offices, and the local radio station plays Soviet ballads and Russian pop songs, interspersed with excerpts from Vladimir Putin’s speeches and news items about Ukraine being “liberated from Nazis.”

“We feel like we’re living a nightmare, and we don’t know when this awful dream will end,” said one local councillor in the city, who asked to remain anonymous, citing security fears. “We still can’t believe that this could have happened.”

As international focus remains on Kharkiv, Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities that have come under heavy Russian bombardment, there is a less violent but no less important battle for Ukraine’s future going on in a stretch of southern Ukraine that came under Russian control in the first days of the war, without major fighting.

Between Mariupol and Mykolaiv, both of which have come under Russian air attack, there are a number of sizable Ukrainian towns currently under Russian occupation.

Areas under Russian control Areas under Russian control

In Berdyansk, a port city to the west of Mariupol with a population of a little over 100,000, the majority of city councillors have remained loyal to Ukraine. They continue to run the city, in defiance of the Russian occupation. However, the Russians may be about to transition to more violent methods.

In nearby Melitopol, the similarly defiant mayor was reportedly kidnapped by Russian soldiers on Friday night, marched from his office with a bag over his head, and has not been heard from since.

01:33 Russian troops appear to kidnap Ukrainian mayor – video

Soon after, Galina Danilchenko, a local councillor affiliated with a traditionally pro-Russian political party, appeared with a video statement calling on locals not to resist the Russians. “Our main task right now is to adapt to the new reality, so that we can begin to live in a new way,” she said.

“They’re trying to set up their own authorities in the occupied cities,” said Olena Zhuk, chair of the council for Zaporizhzhia region, which contains both Melitopol and Berdyansk.

“They are trying to buy people out or find supporters in the current authorities, and the mayor of Melitopol, who refused to cooperate, was kidnapped. It’s absolutely unheard-of behaviour,” she said.

A Telegram channel set up by authorities in Berdyansk to communicate with locals gives a remarkable insight into how the Russian occupation unfolded on the ground.

On 26 February, two days after the Russian assault on Ukraine began, the acting mayor, Alexander Svidlo, made his first video address on the channel. Sitting at a desk, a houseplant behind him, Svidlo noted that “a column of Russian hardware is moving” in the direction of the town, and asked residents to stay calm.

The next day, residents were ordered to switch geolocation off on their mobile phones and remove any suspicious markings on trees or buildings that could be artillery target markers.

On the evening of 27 February, Svidlo appeared again, this time in a dark room, looking exhausted and shaken.

“A few hours ago, we all became witnesses of how heavy military hardware arrived on to the territory of our city,” he said. He explained that Russian soldiers had entered the city administration building.

“We were offered to continue our work but under the control of those people. I believe this to be unacceptable, and so we all left the building and are continuing to work from a distance,” he said. “I don’t know what will happen tomorrow.”

Svidlo and a majority of the city councillors moved from the building to continue their work elsewhere, in defiance of the Russians. At a council meeting held on 3 March, 28 of 38 councillors were present, according to one source who attended.

It seems the Russian army expected large segments of the population in places such as Berdyansk and Melitopol to welcome the Russian army as liberators, as happened in 2014 in Crimea.

“For years they have been lying to themselves that people in Ukraine were supposedly waiting for Russia to come,” said the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in a video address released over the weekend. “They did not find collaborators who would hand over the city and the power to the invaders.”

Many older residents of the region felt disfranchised in modern Ukraine, but these views have been changing gradually over the past decade, and then rapidly during the last two weeks of the Russian attack on Ukraine.

“Of course, there are some fans of the ‘Russian world’ among the population, but every day they are fewer and fewer. People can see that the ‘Russian world’ is not what Russian propaganda promises. It’s poverty, violence and destruction,” said Anna Ukrainska, a schoolteacher in Berdyansk.

In Berdyansk, as in many occupied cities, protests have drawn hundreds if not thousands of unarmed Ukrainians to the streets, often furiously shouting abuse at the Russian soldiers, who appear uncertain how to react.

In the town of Nova Kakhovka, Russian authorities threatened to cut off water and electricity if another protest was staged, according to one resident who attended a protest a week ago. Nevertheless, on Sunday a second protest took place in the town, as well as in numerous other cities.

“People came out with their children … there were also old people with walking sticks,” said Lera, a local woman who attended a protest in Kherson, a regional capital also currently under Russian control.



In a video from the protest sent by Lera, protesters can be seen walking past a column of Russian military vehicles, chanting “Russian fascist occupiers, out.” At one point the Russian soldiers start shooting into the air.

A counter-protest on the same day was organised by the Russians, said Lera, using people she believed were not local, and was filmed to create images suggesting Kherson was welcoming Russian troops.

Rumours have been spreading that the Russian occupying authorities are planning to stage a referendum in Kherson, similar to those held in Crimea and the Donbas in 2014 that provided a veneer of legitimacy for Russian actions.

Russian soldiers have set up checkpoints throughout the city, and Lera said two friends had told her that in the past few days the soldiers had started demanding to inspect the phones of those passing through.

In Berdyansk, Russians have also set up checkpoints on the outskirts of the city, preventing people from leaving. In any case, doing so would require a dangerous drive across the frontlines.

Supermarket shelves in the city are empty and there is a dangerous shortage of medicines. On Sunday evening, Svidlo posted that two city workers had managed to drive a van of medicines safely into the city, which would help save lives.

The mayor’s office is putting together a list of people who want to leave in the event that a humanitarian corridor can be agreed with the Russians, but so far there has been no agreement.

Each evening, residents listen to the voice of the Russians on the radio, who address the locals with promises of a happy new life and threaten criminal cases against Ukrainian officials. Many, however, remain sceptical of the promises.

“On the radio, they address people as ‘comrades’. They still live in the Soviet Union and they want to build it here. We have already moved ahead of them by several decades, we don’t need that,” said the local councillor.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/were-living-a-nightmare-life-in-russian-occupied-southern-ukraine

Speaking via a translator, Oleksandr Markushyn described the ""heavy, heavy shelling and bombardment going on"" throughout the city, with Russian forces hitting schools, residential areas and private homes - as well as the city's palace of culture.

He said daily evacuations were ongoing, but fraught with risk: ""I was participating in the evacuation of a column of around 100 people; it was the only safe place where we could evacuate people,"" he recalled, ""fifty metres in front of me there was a family - two kids, a husband and wife - and they were killed by a mine.

""Unfortunately these things are happening all the time, they are shooting at peaceful civilians. We were taking people out in vehicles and buses - it's not possible [allowed] to shoot civilians but they are doing that. This is barbaric, they are barbarous.""

He said there was no heating, mobile communications or water in the city currently. ""People are hiding in cellars, they use improvised stoves to warm themselves"" and rely on volunteers to help supply them with food.

""We continue evacuating people - we have been doing this today, we do this on a daily basis - but there are 5,000 -7,000 residents who want to stay. It's day 19 and we are holding on - and so the situation continues.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-60717902/page/2

MYKOLAIV, Ukraine — At the front line of the battle for southern Ukraine, Diana was having her birthday party in the unfinished basement of an apartment building. She turned 5 on Monday. In the absence of a cake, her parents stuck a candle in a mandarin orange and told her to make a wish.

After she blew out the flame, Diana told them she asked for the war to end soon.

“Come see the basement, that’s where we live,” she said, bounding down the stairs that lead to the space that’s now a bomb shelter for the neighborhood.

Some people have brought down cots and air mattresses to place on the cold earthen ground. It’s dark. The fighting in the distance during the day sounds like far-off thunder. At night, the bombardment is louder and closer.

This apartment building complex in southeastern Mykolaiv is in range of Russia’s multiple-launch rocket systems located in nearby Kherson, the first significant city Moscow’s military captured since its invasion of Ukraine started nearly three weeks ago. Now Mykolaiv, a city of about 500,000 people on Ukraine’s Black Sea shoreline, is all that’s standing in Russia’s way of an assault on the major port city of Odessa.

But despite more than a week of heavy bombardment, Ukraine’s forces in Mykolaiv have remarkably thwarted Russian advances — a major blow to the Kremlin’s apparent plans for an attack on Odessa, an economic lifeline for Ukraine as one of the largest Black Sea ports. Though Russian warships have lingered off the coast of Odessa, local officials have said the Russians are probably delaying any amphibious assault until they can get more ground support from their forces in the east.

That is how Mykolaiv has become a crucial roadblock. The region’s governor, Vitaliy Kim, told The Washington Post on Monday that some Russian forces were beaten back from here and are currently located in Kherson, about 40 miles to the southeast. They’ve repeatedly shelled the city, including civilian residences, with suspected cluster munitions, but have been unable to move into Mykolaiv itself.

Ukraine’s stand at Mykolaiv underscores how Russia’s advance in parts of the country has stalled, making this war more of a fight than many expected. Russia has more manpower and firepower, but it has been bogged down by what U.S. officials have said was a poor military strategy and basic logistical and supply issues.

“The forces that they sent, they thought they’d easily march through here because this was a region that didn’t have enough military presence,” Kim said. “But we’ve showed them the opposite, with our soldiers and our civilian defense, that they have no business roaming around on our land.”

Kim has become the face of Mykolaiv’s resistance and a major national figure. Perhaps inspired by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s powerful video messages from downtown Kyiv, Kim cheerfully addresses Mykolaiv citizens with similar short updates posted to his Telegram channel every few hours. His feed has 700,000 subscribers, more than the city’s population.

“Good day, we are from Ukraine,” Kim starts every video, holding up a peace sign. On Monday, he told viewers that an air-raid alert in the city would be extended because the Russians had heavily shelled the region overnight and “we don’t know what’s in the head of those dummies.” The day before, Kim thanked everyone for the birthday wishes — he turned 41 — and said, “how dumb these occupiers are, it’s just a catastrophe.”

“They go from one direction and get bashed, they go from another direction and get bashed and then go from a third direction and get bashed as well,” he said with a grin.

His optimistic nature in the face of an assault on his city has resonated with Ukrainians and turned Kim into something of a celebrity. At a military checkpoint at the edge of the city, a soldier commented that meeting Kim now is “like meeting Biden.”

“It just seems like everything is relaxed and easy here, but this is hard work every day,” Kim told The Post. “But there’s no need to look sad or feel tired over it.”

Like other cities across Ukraine, Mykolaiv has adapted to wartime. Movements across the city’s bridges are regulated through checkpoints. If Russians manage to gain ground here, the bridges might be blown up to prevent any further advance. Stacks of tires are positioned around streets with molotov cocktails, or petrol bombs, beside them, ready to be set ablaze if Russian troops approach.

There are also signs of the fight that has already taken place. On one downtown street, the glass facade of a furniture store was shattered. Two homes across the street have had the roofs burned off. This is where Ukrainian and Russian armored vehicles had a shootout in the first days of the war and where the Ukrainians said they destroyed the Russian column. The damage left behind is at once a reminder of the war’s toll and a proud symbol of a small victory.

At a pharmacy down the road, a shell landed in front, shattered the sign and knocked out power. Two days later, the pharmacy continued its work, powered by a generator. The local zoo, which boasts the most animals of any zoo in Ukraine, has had four projectiles land on its property. The animals have not been evacuated and are being fed daily, said Volodymyr Topchiy, the zoo’s director.

A rocket that landed on the grounds on Feb. 27 is now on display in the zoo’s museum. Another still-unexploded ordnance is nestled into the ground in a bustard’s dwelling.

“This is such a rare bird; there are only two in Ukraine,” Topchiy said. The bird was unharmed and remains in its home — along with the shell.

The rocket appeared to carry cluster munitions, according to two former military bomb technicians who reviewed photos of it. The cluster bomblets are indiscriminately released over a wide area and have a high dud rate, posing a threat to civilians who may encounter them later on.

“I’m getting the sense that Mykolaiv is getting used to the shelling and is ignoring it,” Kim said in his Tuesday morning video message. “At the moment, everyone’s calm.”

In the city’s Korabelnyi district, a shell from a Russian multiple-launch rocket system, which has a range of about 50 miles, landed on an apartment building, causing one whole side to catch fire. Alexander Zadere lived in the building next door, so he and his son managed to get his 83-year-old mother out of the apartment where she had lived for more than 50 years. She was shocked and scared but not injured.

The wall that faces outside was gone. The flames peeled the paint off the walls. The television was destroyed, but the remote resting on the charred couch was undamaged.

Zadere has already turned his attention to renovating the place for her, sure that there is a future here. The money he had been saving for a country house will now be used to rebuild here.

“As a Mykolaiv native, I can tell you they won’t pass through us,” he said. “Victory will follow us.”

Diana’s bunker birthday party was taking place in the apartment building next door. The one open store in the area sold chocolate eggs with a toy inside, so that was the present Diana’s grandmother bought her.

Diana was cheerful, despite the war all around her. She sang a song about cats and danced outside while it was temporarily safe to leave the underground dwelling. She’s been sleeping through the night. Her parents smiled and said they hoped Diana wouldn’t remember this when she grew up.

They worried about how much more their city could withstand.

“If Mykolaiv goes, it’s not clear that other cities will hold for as long as this one has,” said Sveta, Diana’s mom. “We’re getting used to it, but we don’t want to. We don’t want to live with this pain and fear.”

Ukraine's authorities accused Russia of preventing the evacuation of people from the heavily besieged port city of Mariupol in the south of the country. Conditions in the city are dire, with civilians trapped there. Food, water and electricity are scarce.

More than 1,500 people have died in Mariupol from siege attacks so far, the Associated Press reported Sunday, citing the mayor's office.

In Kherson, several thousand people came out for a peaceful ""Kherson is Ukraine"" rally. Later, the invaders opened fire at the rally.

Source: eyewitness Olena Kozak on Facebook; Information Resistance Association; Suspilne Media. Kherson.

Details: Many people were holding placards and Ukrainian flags.

As can be seen from Kozak's video, people are chanting ""Go home"", ""Go home while you're still alive"", ""Ukraine above all"", ""Glory to the nation - death to the enemies"", ""Russian soldier, go f**k yourself"", ""Kherson is Ukraine"", ""Russia is a s**t-house, victory will be ours"".

People are rallying despite the fact that dozens of armed Russian soldiers and many Russian vehicles are stationed around.

According to ""Information Resistance"", about 10 thousand Kherson residents came out to protest against the proclamation of the so-called ""Kherson People's Republic"" by the invaders.

Later, at a rally in Kherson, the occupiers opened fire. When this happened, people were chanting: ""The Russian soldier is a fascist occupant!""

According to the local journalist Konstantin Ryzhenko, shots were fired at people’s legs at the rally. At least one man was hit in the leg by the occupiers with a rubber bullet.

Also in Kherson, several people rallied in support of the occupiers. They held up red USSR flags.

Among them were Ihor Semenchev, a city council member; Serhiy Cherevko, former deputy mayor of Kherson; pro-Russian Kherson activist Kirill Stremousov; Tatiana Kuzmich, a teacher at the Kherson Academy of Continuing Education; Volodymyr Saldo, former mayor of Kherson; and Hennadiy Balbota.

What happened earlier: On 13 March, military vehicles were being driven around Melitopol, a town in Zaporizhzhia region temporarily occupied by Russian troops, warning residents through loudspeakers in Russian that rallies and demonstrations are prohibited. At the same time, as witnessed by a video recorded on the streets of the city, Melitopol residents were sending this message and the occupiers themselves in an internationally known direction - following the Russian warship.

Ukrainian commanders said on Wednesday that Russian military police had rounded up 400 activists and allegedly taken them hostage after they were caught protesting Moscow's invasion.

Russian soldiers hit at least one of the protesters and fired gunshots into the air while arresting the Kherson residents, according to former Ukrainian Finance Minister Tymofiy Mylovanov.

Footage posted on social media on March 5 showed residents of the city protesting over the Russian occupation.

Demonstrators were arrested for rallying against the occupation of their hometown Kherson - the only city under Russian control.

The city was captured by Vladimir Putin's men overnight on March 1, five days after Moscow ordered its troops to invade Ukraine.

It is the latest effort by Russia's President Putin to extend the hand of his police state across the border to grab activists on foreign soil.

It comes as shortages of medicine and food in the occupied city have left vulnerable people waiting to die, according to civilians living in the city.

While shops in the city remain open, supplies are not getting through.

There were also concerns about food shortages, and there had been no indications from the Russians when supplies might be allowed into the city.

Deliveries heading to Kherson have to be guarded, as cars coming into the city are shot at by the Russians, residents said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia would attempt to fake a referendum and annex Kherson after Putin's invaders occupied the city.

Protests emerged as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned against the formation of a 'pseudo-republic' in the south of his country on Sunday.

Zelensky said Russians were using blackmail and bribery in an attempt to force local officials to form a break-away region in the south, much like those in Donetsk and Luhansk - which Putin declared as 'independent' at the start of the war.

A crackdown on protesters and civic officials is underway in the first major Ukrainian city seized by Russia, according to multiple sources.

Occupying troops or security elements working for the new military administration in Kherson have been seen marching one person out of his home with a hood placed over his head.

The Kremlin’s newly-imposed regime has been in charge since March 2, with reports of troops killing civilians and looting stores in the southern port, which lies close to Crimea and the Black Sea.

Hundreds of protesters, officials and those connected to the Ukrainian military and police are said to have been detained.

The imposition of Moscow’s rule follows accounts of hundreds of bodies being left on the streets after Russian forces overcame regular Ukrainian units and encountered lightly-armed territorial defence fighters.

On Friday, Metro.co.uk told how occupying troops were imposing their rule in the shipbuilding centre, a key strategic point, with long queues for food and petrol as supplies of essential goods ran low.

The husband of a woman with family in Kherson has spoken to contacts in the city who have given disturbing accounts of life under the new regime.

The man, who lives in France with his wife, said: ‘We have heard that there might have been 200 to 300 arrests after the protests.

‘I don’t have any way to verify that number but a block away from where my mother-in-law lives they went to someone’s house and they took a guy, they took him out with a hood or sack over his head.

‘People in the neighbourhood reported the incident.

‘They [the Russians] are arresting people from the police, people who are identified as potential leaders, to scare people, to force people not to come out to protest.’

The city council is said to have resigned after the new administration proposed a referendum on whether Kherson should become an independent republic. The move would make the city similar to the self-declared ‘people’s republics’ held by Pro-Russian separatists in the eastern Donbass region.

Cut off from existing Ukrainian supply routes and with no safe way to leave the city, residents are enduring food and medicine shortages.

The man’s mother-in-law, speaking from Kherson today, spoke of her fears but also said citizens ‘will not bend’ to the Kremln’s rule.

‘The police and anyone who is linked to the military somehow is being hunted down,’ Alla told Metro.co.uk. ‘Probably those with hoods placed on their heads are being linked to the military or the police.’

The family does not know why the man was led away on Friday but Alla’s daughter said one activist had been detained and not heard from again, with the new administration also carrying out ‘raids’ on people’s homes to ‘talk to them and invite them to change position’.

Russian forces took control after a fierce, back-and-forth battle for a key bridge on the outskirts of the city, after which they broke through and carried out what has been described as a massacre of volunteer defence forces making a last line of defence.

The mum and daughter have been told by reliable sources that hundreds of bodies were left in the streets.

‘It was terrifying when they were defending the bridge,’ Alla said.

‘When the territorial defence defended the city a lot of them died.

‘They dug trenches and put up barricades and had Molotov cocktails and some guns, they were regular citizens who had basic training and hundreds of them died. There were more or less bodies all over the city.

‘The next day they got collected.’

Food supplies were said on Friday to have had only days left before stocks on supermarket shelves ran out completely, but sources since seem to have been found within the occupied area.

A video passed to Metro.co.uk shows a long line of people waiting patiently outside a food store, which has become a daily occurrence.

‘We can still hear shelling every night,’ Alla said.

‘We’re upset and frightened about what the future is going to bring.

‘We have food because there are supplies from nearby villages or trading centres which have managed to provide some vegetables, so it’s become a little bit easier. But we have to queue with hundreds of people every morning. The biggest problem is medication, particularly for people with chronic disease or diabetes or heart problems.

‘It’s impossible to buy anything any more.’

Alla, 60, was living alone but has since moved in with friends for safety and because they have a basement where they can shelter.

The reports echo separate accounts last week that 400 activists involved in an earlier protest against the occupation had been rounded up.

On Saturday, more than 1,000 protesters massed in the city’s main square, chanting ‘Ukrainia’ and displaying the country’s blue-and-yellow flag.

A protest held yesterday attracted fewer people but those present were no less bold in showing their open defiance to the newly-installed regime.

A video taken by one of those present shows demonstrators continuing to march, even as Russian soldiers fire warning shots.

At first, the city’s mayor had been able to make announcements on Facebook and carry out at least some functions of his role.

But activists are now opposing what they have described as a proposal for a ‘pseudo’ referendum in order to force the city and its remaining officials into compliance with Moscow.

Alla told Metro.co.uk that Russian soldiers tasked with enforcing the new order had been looting shops and drinking stolen alcohol at night.

‘The Russian army looted stores to get food and electronic devices, they took everything they wanted,’ she said. ‘And I have heard that many soldiers are drinking alcohol looted from the shops at night.’

The accountant also said it was impossible to leave Kherson as it was completely blockaded by Russian forces.

Tens of thousands of people have been able to leave other Ukrainian cities in humanitarian corridors opened up over the past week.

‘Russia is now trying to portray the first city it has captured as being waiting for its soldiers and they are trying to create this people’s republic,’ Alla said.

‘But the truth is the people are completely opposed to the occupiers and we will not bend to their rule. We don’t want to step out of Ukraine.’

Metro.co.uk has not named the family and used a false name for the mum in order to protect them from reprisals.

Residents were able to leave besieged Mariupol, another Black Sea port, in 160 private cars today after a ‘green’ route was opened up following days of failed attempts to secure evacuations out of the besieged city.

Kyiv was said by defence minister Oleksii Reznikov to look like ‘an apocalypse movie’ as Russian forces continued to edge towards the centre.

At least 636 civilians, including 46 children, have died in Ukraine so far, according to the United Nations. The real toll is likely to be much higher.

Vladimir Putin’s invasion has also triggered the biggest refugee crisis since the Second World War, with more than 2.5million people having left for neighbouring countries.

Local government officials in this city in southern Ukraine, which has been controlled by Russian troops for the past two weeks, have been kicked out of their offices, and the local radio station plays Soviet ballads and Russian pop songs, interspersed with excerpts from Vladimir Putin’s speeches and news items about Ukraine being “liberated from Nazis.”

“We feel like we’re living a nightmare, and we don’t know when this awful dream will end,” said one local councillor in the city, who asked to remain anonymous, citing security fears. “We still can’t believe that this could have happened.”

As international focus remains on Kharkiv, Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities that have come under heavy Russian bombardment, there is a less violent but no less important battle for Ukraine’s future going on in a stretch of southern Ukraine that came under Russian control in the first days of the war, without major fighting.

Between Mariupol and Mykolaiv, both of which have come under Russian air attack, there are a number of sizable Ukrainian towns currently under Russian occupation.

Areas under Russian control Areas under Russian control

In Berdyansk, a port city to the west of Mariupol with a population of a little over 100,000, the majority of city councillors have remained loyal to Ukraine. They continue to run the city, in defiance of the Russian occupation. However, the Russians may be about to transition to more violent methods.

In nearby Melitopol, the similarly defiant mayor was reportedly kidnapped by Russian soldiers on Friday night, marched from his office with a bag over his head, and has not been heard from since.

Soon after, Galina Danilchenko, a local councillor affiliated with a traditionally pro-Russian political party, appeared with a video statement calling on locals not to resist the Russians. “Our main task right now is to adapt to the new reality, so that we can begin to live in a new way,” she said.

“They’re trying to set up their own authorities in the occupied cities,” said Olena Zhuk, chair of the council for Zaporizhzhia region, which contains both Melitopol and Berdyansk.

“They are trying to buy people out or find supporters in the current authorities, and the mayor of Melitopol, who refused to cooperate, was kidnapped. It’s absolutely unheard-of behaviour,” she said.

A Telegram channel set up by authorities in Berdyansk to communicate with locals gives a remarkable insight into how the Russian occupation unfolded on the ground.

On 26 February, two days after the Russian assault on Ukraine began, the acting mayor, Alexander Svidlo, made his first video address on the channel. Sitting at a desk, a houseplant behind him, Svidlo noted that “a column of Russian hardware is moving” in the direction of the town, and asked residents to stay calm.

The next day, residents were ordered to switch geolocation off on their mobile phones and remove any suspicious markings on trees or buildings that could be artillery target markers.

On the evening of 27 February, Svidlo appeared again, this time in a dark room, looking exhausted and shaken.

“A few hours ago, we all became witnesses of how heavy military hardware arrived on to the territory of our city,” he said. He explained that Russian soldiers had entered the city administration building.

“We were offered to continue our work but under the control of those people. I believe this to be unacceptable, and so we all left the building and are continuing to work from a distance,” he said. “I don’t know what will happen tomorrow.”

Svidlo and a majority of the city councillors moved from the building to continue their work elsewhere, in defiance of the Russians. At a council meeting held on 3 March, 28 of 38 councillors were present, according to one source who attended.

It seems the Russian army expected large segments of the population in places such as Berdyansk and Melitopol to welcome the Russian army as liberators, as happened in 2014 in Crimea.

“For years they have been lying to themselves that people in Ukraine were supposedly waiting for Russia to come,” said the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in a video address released over the weekend. “They did not find collaborators who would hand over the city and the power to the invaders.”

Many older residents of the region felt disfranchised in modern Ukraine, but these views have been changing gradually over the past decade, and then rapidly during the last two weeks of the Russian attack on Ukraine.

“Of course, there are some fans of the ‘Russian world’ among the population, but every day they are fewer and fewer. People can see that the ‘Russian world’ is not what Russian propaganda promises. It’s poverty, violence and destruction,” said Anna Ukrainska, a schoolteacher in Berdyansk.

In Berdyansk, as in many occupied cities, protests have drawn hundreds if not thousands of unarmed Ukrainians to the streets, often furiously shouting abuse at the Russian soldiers, who appear uncertain how to react.

In the town of Nova Kakhovka, Russian authorities threatened to cut off water and electricity if another protest was staged, according to one resident who attended a protest a week ago. Nevertheless, on Sunday a second protest took place in the town, as well as in numerous other cities.

“People came out with their children … there were also old people with walking sticks,” said Lera, a local woman who attended a protest in Kherson, a regional capital also currently under Russian control.



In a video from the protest sent by Lera, protesters can be seen walking past a column of Russian military vehicles, chanting “Russian fascist occupiers, out.” At one point the Russian soldiers start shooting into the air.

A counter-protest on the same day was organised by the Russians, said Lera, using people she believed were not local, and was filmed to create images suggesting Kherson was welcoming Russian troops.

Rumours have been spreading that the Russian occupying authorities are planning to stage a referendum in Kherson, similar to those held in Crimea and the Donbas in 2014 that provided a veneer of legitimacy for Russian actions.

Russian soldiers have set up checkpoints throughout the city, and Lera said two friends had told her that in the past few days the soldiers had started demanding to inspect the phones of those passing through.

In Berdyansk, Russians have also set up checkpoints on the outskirts of the city, preventing people from leaving. In any case, doing so would require a dangerous drive across the frontlines.

Supermarket shelves in the city are empty and there is a dangerous shortage of medicines. On Sunday evening, Svidlo posted that two city workers had managed to drive a van of medicines safely into the city, which would help save lives.

The mayor’s office is putting together a list of people who want to leave in the event that a humanitarian corridor can be agreed with the Russians, but so far there has been no agreement.

Each evening, residents listen to the voice of the Russians on the radio, who address the locals with promises of a happy new life and threaten criminal cases against Ukrainian officials. Many, however, remain sceptical of the promises.

“On the radio, they address people as ‘comrades’. They still live in the Soviet Union and they want to build it here. We have already moved ahead of them by several decades, we don’t need that,” said the local councillor.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/were-living-a-nightmare-life-in-russian-occupied-southern-ukraine

But Zelenskyy says the ""effectiveness of instruments of influence"" on Russia used by Ukraine as well as its entire anti-war coalition against Russia must be taken into account, when predicting how long the war will last.

""The success of our military on the battlefield is really significant. Historically significant. But not enough to clean our land from the occupiers yet. We'll beat them more,"" he said.

""Sanctions against Russia are very significant. Economically painful. But still not enough for the Russian military machine to be left without means of subsistence. We promote stronger, more destructive ones,"" Zelenskyy said.

In the meantime, they continue to target a number of encircled cities to routine air, missile, and artillery strikes, which has led to hundreds of civilian casualties and driven millions more from their homes. Today, Russian warships arrived at Berdyansk, an occupied city on the Sea of Azov that is situated near the key port city of Mariupol, which remains in Ukrainian hands. Local authorities in Mariupol, which has been subjected to a particularly brutal siege for more than a week now, said today that a convoy of civilians had finally been able to safely flee the area.

Before diving into the latest news below, readers should be sure to get themselves up to speed on the state of the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine, which is now in its third week, with our prior rolling coverage here.

UPDATED: 6:00 PM EST—

Estonia's parliament, or Riigikogu, has passed a resolution that, among other things, calls on United Nations member states to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine and for countries of the world to enforce sanctions and enact a trade embargo against Russia and Belarus. Estonian lawmakers also called on other nations to close their airspace and ports to Russian aircraft and ships and voiced support for Ukraine's future membership in the European Union and NATO.

Estonia is an EU and a NATO member, and this resolution comes after the alliance decided formally not to respond to appeals from Ukrainian authorities to establish a no-fly zone over the country. A no-fly zone would put NATO in a direct military confrontation with the Kremlin, raising the risk of a larger regional conflict erupting.

The prospects of the United Nations providing a firm legal mandate for a no-fly zone seem equally remote. Russia is a permeant member of the U.N. Security Council and has the power to veto any resolution that might authorize such a mission.

The Financial Times newspaper has reported that not only did the U.S. government have information that Russia had sought military assistance from the Chinese government to assist in its current operations in Ukraine, but that authorities in Beijing were at least open to the idea. American officials met with their Chinese counterparts over this matter, which both Russia and China have denied is even being discussed.

The Ukrainian city of Kharkiv has reportedly been subjected to another night of intense shelling.

The Russian Ministry of Defense has released what it says is footage, likely shot using a video camera on an unmanned aircraft, of a missile strike targeting a Ukrainian rocket artillery unit.

Below are some new and interesting pictures of Ukrainian special operations forces with various weapons, including British-supplied NLAW guided anti-tank missiles.

The British government says it has seen no evidence to support Russia's claims Ukraine is preparing to launch chemical or biological weapon attacks. The Russian government has continued to make a variety of wholly unsubstantiated allegations about provocations that Ukrainian authorities and their international partners, especially the United States, are purportedly preparing to carry out in order to justify its ongoing operations in the country.

Marina Ovsyannikova, an editor at Russia's state-run Channel One television network, made a bold on-air protest against the war in Ukraine.

A group of individuals in the British capital London have occupied a mansion owned by Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska in protest of the war in Ukraine.

UPDATED: 2:50 PM EST—

Russian forces have launched more than 900 ballistic and cruise missiles at targets in Ukraine since its invasion began, according to a senior U.S. defense official. Russia's military maintains some 90 percent of the combat capacity it arrayed around the country in the lead-up to conflict, as well.

These strikes include ""more than a couple dozen"" cruise missiles that Russian bombers launched at a Ukrainian base close to the Polish border on Sunday. Yavoriv, which is less than 15 miles from Poland, had hosted a contingent of U.S. military personnel on an advisory mission until shortly before the invasion began. No American troops are presently there and the Pentagon says that it is not a transshipment point for U.S. and other foreign military assistance, which is continuing to flow into Ukraine.

The Pentagon says it is still not considering supplying Ukraine with more advanced air defense systems or additional combat aircraft, such as second-hand MiG-29 Fulcrum fighter jets, despite Ukraine's request. The U.S. military's position has been that there are more effective ways to bolster Ukrainian air defenses and other capabilities.

The Kremlin does not appear to be moving any additional reserve forces toward Ukraine to bolster its forces in the country, but is now actively ""advertising for foreign fighters,"" according to a senior U.S. defense official. The Russian military is also still resupplying forces in Ukraine from stocks moved to areas along the border with the country. Ukrainian forces are actively working to interdict those supply chains.

Ukraine's fleet of Turkish-made TB2 drones continues to be an important factor in strikes on Russian logistical elements and other units. The Kremlin's forces have still not been able to achieve air superiority, according to a senior U.S. defense official, who added that the situation in the skies above the country has been shifting ""literally hour to hour.""

The U.S. military believes Russian forces are attempting to prevent Ukrainian forces from retreating out of the Donbas region, moving a force with dozens of vehicles into an apparent position to try to block their movement. Russia's military has sought to regroup its own forces for new offensives, but continues to struggle to make major gains and a ""siege mentality"" continues to dominate its current operations.

James Heappey, a British member parliament and the country's Under-Secretary of State for the Armed Forces, Tweeted today that he had visited a facility in Stuttgart, Germany, that is being used to coordinate military aid to Ukraine.

Ukrainian authorities now say that between 600 and 700 people were able to evacuate Mariupol in the convoy earlier today, but have accused Russia of blocking additional evacuations. An aid convoy was also reportedly prevented from entering the city.

Commercial satellite imagery indicates that a group of Russian naval vessels positioned off the western coast of Crimea largely remain in place. There have been concerns for weeks now that the Kremlin might be about to launch a new offensive along Ukraine's Black Sea coastline, including amphibious landings as part of an effort to take the port city of Odesa. So far, this has not materialized.

Russian forces look to have shelled the Antonov aviation company's main plant near Kyiv today. This facility, among other things, reportedly houses an unfinished second example of the An-225 Mriya aircraft. What had been the only flying example of the An-225, one of the largest aircraft in the world, was destroyed earlier in the fighting.

A picture has appeared on social media reportedly showing that Ukrainian forces have captured a relatively rare Russian 2S34 self-propelled gun-mortar, nicknamed the Khosta or Hosta. These vehicles are conversions of older 2S1 Gvozdika 122mm self-propelled howitzers that feature a new turret with a 120mm gun-mortar.

POSTED: 1:35 PM EST—

Russian Navy amphibious warships and other vessels arrived in Berdyansk earlier today. Russian forces claimed to have first captured this port city on the Sea of Azov on February 27, just days after the invasion kicked off.

In addition, Russian forces in Berdyansk showed off captured Ukrainian hardware, including some 10 navy and coast guard vessels, to reporters from the quasi-state media outlet RT. At least two Ukrainian Gyurza-M class patrol boats are among those now in Russian hands. Russia's security services had previously seized a pair of these vessels, along with a Ukrainian Navy tug, during an incident in the Sea of Azov in 2018, before returning them the following year.

The appearance of additional Russian forces in Berdyansk comes as the Kremlin continues to try to tighten its grip on Mariupol, also on the Sea of Azov and still under Ukrainian control, to the northeast.

Local authorities in Mariupol said that an evacuation convoy consisting of 160 civilian cars was able to safely leave the city today. They added that those vehicles had then successfully made it past Berdyansk and were heading toward Zaporozhye to the north, which remains in Ukrainian hands.

Mariupol remains a key objective for Russian forces in Ukraine. Capturing the city can only help them fully secure the coastline along the Sea of Azov, which provides a landbridge between western Russia and the occupied Crimean Peninsula via breakaway areas of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. Dmitry Peskov, Russian President Vladimir Putin's top spokesperson, said today that Russian forces may well push to take over other major cities in Ukraine, something that has long appeared to be part of the Kremlin's overall operational plan.

Ukrainian authorities have tried multiple times already to help civilians evacuate from Mariupol through designated ""humanitarian coordinators"" negotiated with Russian officials. All the previous attempts have failed amid accusations that Russian forces refused to honor temporary ceasefires to allow convoys to leave the area safely. Hundreds of thousands of civilians still remain trapped in the city. Earlier today, it had been reported that Ukrainian officials had still not secured sufficient guarantees regarding an evacuation from Mariupol, despite having negotiated safe passage for civilians leaving other cities.

For more than a week now Mariupol has been encircled, cutting off supplies to the city. Officials there have said that residents have been without running water and heat for days now. Routine and indiscriminate Russian shelling and other attacks have left the city increasingly devastated overall. Mariupol was notably the site of a now-infamous strike on a children's/maternity hospital last week. A pregnant woman who was seen in one of the pictures taken in the immediate aftermath of that attack has now reportedly died along with her unborn child.

Ukrainian forces in and around Mariupol have refused to cede the city and are still fighting against Russian forces. The video in the Tweet below reportedly shows Ukrainian forces in a BTR-4 wheeled armored personnel carrier engaging Russian armored vehicles in relatively close-quarters street-fighting.

Russian air, artillery missile strikes continue to pound other major cities in Ukraine, especially in the eastern half of the country, including the capital Kyiv. Wladimir Klitschko, brother of Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko, posted the video below on social media today showing some of the damage inflicted on that city.

The video below reportedly shows the remains of an intercepted missile falling inside Kyiv.

The video below reportedly shows one of Ukraine's Turkish-made TB2 armed drones destroying a Russian Tor-M1 surface-to-air missile (SAM) system.

The skies over Ukraine continue to be contested even after more than two weeks. Ukrainian forces are still employing ground-based air defenses, including shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, also known as man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS), to great effect. The Russian Ministry of Defense released a video today, seen below, showing an Su-25 Frogfoot ground-attack aircraft that it said made it back to base after being hit by a MANPADS.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed yesterday that the Russian military had lost nearly 13,000 personnel, as well as dozens of planes and helicopters, among other things. Those numbers are much higher than independent estimates and cannot be readily confirmed.

There were reports today that at least one Tochka short-range ballistic missile loaded with cluster munitions hit the city of Donetsk, which has been under the control of Kremlin-backed separatists since 2015. Ukraine and Russia both have stocks of these missiles and have employed them in the conflict already. Separatist authorities have blamed Ukrainian forces for the attack, but also said that they had intercepted the missile, raising questions about whether the city center was the intended target.

A video has emerged online that reportedly shows a modified BMW 6 series convertible with a 12.7mm NSV heavy machine gun fitted at the back. It's unclear whether or not this car is actually being employed as a makeshift combat vehicle.

Ukrainian authorities say that the fourth round of negotiations with Russian officials, which began earlier today, has now been paused until tomorrow. The talks today were conducted via video conference unlike previous meetings, which were held in-person at a site near the Belarusian border.

Energoatom, Ukraine's state-run nuclear enterprise, issued a statement saying that Russian forces had conducted a controlled detonation of explosives at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant and that more were planned. It's unclear why Russia's military is carrying out this activity at this nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe, which it took control of last week.

Potential risks to nuclear infrastructure in Ukraine continue to be of general concern. Power was reportedly cut again to the site of the now-defunct Chernobyl power plant. A spent fuel rod storage facility and others there need outside power to continue to operate safely.

Israel has said publicly for the first time that it will comply with international sanctions against Russia.

Russia has denied U.S. government claims that it is seeking military assistance from China to continue its operations in Ukraine.

this is the pathway that is bringing thousands of Ukrainian refugees to safety and also to a life of uncertainty. Many of these people have been traveling from the interior of the country. We spoke with one family that had come from Caribbean rig, which is as fate would have it. The hometown of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelinski Hometown obviously has become such a beloved figure among the Ukrainian people. They told us they had been traveling since 7:00 AM on Sunday and it was just after midnight when they finally arrived to this border checkpoint in the cold here in Poland. And the uncertainty now comes from the fact that as these families begin to board these busses, what happens to them next is still very much up in the air. They will be taken to temporary shelter in a nearby town here on the polish border. And they will be able to figure out what to do next where to go next. And that is the question That so many of them are now facing. Because many of them when you speak to these refugees, they talk about their homes in the past tense. So they don't know if they're going home in the coming weeks or even months or if ever. And this is an operation here in this in the border city of Medica Poland, that is running 24 hours a day as thousands of refugees continue to come across the border. And this is a scene that even here in the late hours continues to unfold as thousands of refugees continue to arrive at the border here in western Ukraine. A great deal of uncertainty about what happens next. A great deal of emotion, watching what so many of these people and the journey they've been through. And this is a scene that just continues to play out around the clock here in Poland. Ed Lavandera. CNN medical Poland. Yeah.

Almost three weeks after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, its forces are expanding their offensive to the west of the country. Here are five important developments from this weekend.Russian missiles kill dozens at military training center near Polish borderAt least 35 people were killed and 134 injured in a Russian missile strike on the Yavoriv military training base in western Ukraine early Sunday local time, Ukrainian authorities said.The base is located about 25 miles northwest of Lviv and less than 12.5 miles from the Polish border. It's home to the International Peacekeeping and Security Center, which hosts training exercises with Western military personnel.On Sunday, Russia said up to 180 foreign mercenaries were killed by the strikes, but Ukrainian Defense Ministry spokesperson Markiyan Lubkivsky told CNN the claims were ""pure Russian propaganda.""Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said there had been ""some damage"" to the facility, but the Pentagon was ""still assessing and talking to the Ukrainians"" about the extent of it.No American service members were at the training facility because they had all left weeks earlier, Kirby told ABC on Sunday.The strikes show increased Russian focus on the west of the country, he added. ""This is the third... facility or airfield that the Russians have struck in western Ukraine in just the last couple of days, so clearly, at least from an airstrike perspective, they're broadening their target sets,"" Kirby said.Explosions in Kyiv as Russian forces inch closerAt least two people died and three more were hospitalized after a residential building in Obolon, a suburb of the capital, Kyiv, was hit by shelling early on Monday morning, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said.Several heavy explosions also reverberated across Kyiv at 11 a.m. local time (5 a.m. ET) Monday.They appear to have been caused by Ukrainian air-defense batteries aiming at either Russian aircraft or cruise missiles. Trails of smoke heading into the sky could be seen from central Kyiv.On Saturday, the UK Ministry of Defence said the bulk of Russian ground forces were now only 15.5 miles from the center of the Ukrainian capital.Thousands dead in Mariupol as conditions grow even worseMore than 2,500 people have been killed by the Russian bombardment of the southern city of Mariupol, according to Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser in President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office, and the humanitarian situation continues to worsen.""The Russians are just wiping the city out,"" Arestovych said on Monday.A shipment of humanitarian supplies has been unable to reach the city due to heavy shelling, Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said on Sunday.""The city of Mariupol was subjected to shelling and aerial bombardment all day long,"" Vereshchuk said. ""The humanitarian cargo remained blocked in the city of Berdyansk halfway to the occupied city.""On Sunday morning, a Mariupol resident recorded a video diary revealing the desperate situation for civilians. The footage, posted on Twitter, shows looted shops and people trying to cook outdoors in sub-zero temperatures.""There's no humanitarian aid and will not be. The evacuation of peaceful people is impossible,"" the resident said.""People are in a devastating situation. Water, food are coming to an end, people are forced to break into shops, in search for necessities.""Mass protests in occupied Kherson and accusations of treason in MelitopolThe strategic city of Kherson in southern Ukraine has been occupied by Russian forces since March 3, but on Sunday hundreds of people took to the streets to protest the occupation.In recent days, at least one Kherson regional council official warned that occupation forces were laying the groundwork for a ""Kherson People's Republic.""City mayor Ihor Kolykhaiev said the demonstration was ""a peaceful protest to show that the citizens' position is that Kherson is Ukraine.""Russian forces have been accused of abducting local Ukrainian officials in two other cities.On Friday, the mayor of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, was seen on video being led away from a government building in the city by armed men.A short time later, the Russian-backed Luhansk regional prosecutor claimed that Fedorov had committed terrorism offenses and was under investigation.Galina Danilchenko was installed as the new mayor of the city, but Ukraine's prosecutor general has opened an investigation after a group of Melitopol City Council members issued a written statement on Sunday accusing her of ""the high crime of treason, for attempting to set up an occupying government in Melitopol.""Separately, Yevhen Matveyev, the mayor of Dniprorudne in Zaporizhzhia region, was abducted by Russian troops on Sunday, according to Ukraine's Foreign Minister, Dmytro Kuleba.US-China talks scheduled after Moscow reportedly asks Beijing for military support in UkraineRussia has asked China for military support, including drones, as well as economic assistance for its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, according to conversations CNN had with two U.S. officials.Potential assistance from the Chinese would be a significant development. It could upend the hold Ukrainian forces still have in the country, and provide a counterweight to the hefty Western sanctions imposed on Russia's economy.When asked by CNN about the reporting of Russia's request for military aid, Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in the U.S., said in a statement: ""I've never heard of that."" The Russian embassy in the U.S. did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.U.S. and Chinese officials will meet in Rome on Monday for talks that experts say could have far-reaching consequences not only for the war in Ukraine, but for China's role in the world and its relationship with the West.The meeting, between China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, and U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan, comes as concerns grow in the West that Beijing is not only siding with Russia by not condemning its aggression in Ukraine, but could take further steps to aid its strategic partner.",https://www.kcra.com/article/what-happened-in-ukraine-over-the-weekend-march-14/39427687

Ukraine has been able to evacuate more than 4,000 people from front-line cities on Monday via seven humanitarian corridors, Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in a video statement.

Vereshchuk said three other humanitarian corridors did not operate successfully and she accused Russian forces of firing on civilians who were evacuating the Kyiv region. Russia has denied firing on civilians.

US concerned about China aligning with Russia

United States national security adviser Jake Sullivan has raised concerns about China’s alignment with Russia in a seven-hour meeting with Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi.

The meeting took place in Rome as the US told NATO allies and several Asian countries that China had signalled its willingness to provide military and economic aid to Russia to support its war, two US officials who spoke to the Reuters news agency on condition of anonymity said.

Washington warned Beijing of the isolation and penalties it will face if it helps Moscow in its invasion of Ukraine. One official described the meeting as “intense,” reflecting “the gravity of the moment.”

US defence secretary adds Bulgaria to European trip

US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is adding a stop in Bulgaria to a Europe trip focused on bolstering NATO allies as war rages on in Ukraine, the Pentagon has said.

Austin will leave on Tuesday for Brussels, where he will attend a NATO meeting before travelling to Slovakia. In Bulgaria, Austin will meet military and civilian leaders, it said, without offering further details on his agenda.

Bulgaria, Moscow’s closest ally during the Cold War, is now a European Union and NATO member state that has condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

UNHCR hails record $200 million in private sector donations for Ukraine

The United Nations refugee agency has said the private sector provided “record-breaking amounts” towards its efforts to support those displaced by the invasion of Ukraine.

“In just over two weeks, companies, foundations and philanthropists have contributed over $200 million towards UNHCR’s Ukraine emergency response,” it said in a statement.

The agency estimates that more than 2.8 million people have been forced to flee Ukraine as refugees since February 24, while at least two million more have been displaced inside the country.

Ukraine’s foreign legion joins the battle against Russia

On February 26, just two days after Russia invaded Ukraine, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy put out a call to foreign volunteers to join the Ukrainian armed forces, announcing the creation of an international legion.

Two days later, the president signed a decree waiving visas for any foreign nationals wishing to join the Ukrainian army, while the foreign affairs ministry launched a website providing details on how to apply.

The Take podcast: Is Russia’s Syria playbook being used in Ukraine?

What can 11 years of war in Syria tell us about Ukraine? This week marks the anniversary of Syria’s uprising and there still seems to be no end to conflict in sight.

There’s also another date that resonates: September 30, 2015, when Russia intervened on behalf of President Bashar al-Assad’s government.

Russia said it tested at least 320 new types of weapons in Syria, some of which are now in use in the war in Ukraine, and it is using tactics that seem to come from what has been called the “Syria playbook”.

We look at how the people all too familiar with that playbook see Syria’s story in Ukraine.

Ukraine’s economy could collapse if war drags on: IMF

The Russian invasion could plunge Ukraine into a devastating recession, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said.

At a minimum, the country would see “output falling 10 percent this year, assuming a prompt resolution of the war,” the IMF said.

The lender added that if the conflict is prolonged, the situation will worsen. Citing wartime data for conflicts in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen, it predicted the “annual output contraction could eventually be much higher, in the range of 25 to 35 percent.”

Russian troops focus efforts on capital Kyiv

Russian troops have refocused their efforts to seize Kyiv, firing artillery on suburbs, a local official said on Ukrainian television.

The official also said a town councillor for Brovary, east of Kyiv, had been killed in fighting there and shells fell on the towns of Irpin, Bucha and Hostomel, which have seen some of the worst conflict during Russia’s stalled attempt to take the capital.

Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan, reporting from Kyiv, said residents in the capital were in for another nervous night, after the shelling of an apartment block in the early morning hours killed at least one person.

“A lot of the residents are very worried that that [attack] may have been an opening salvo for the war for control of the capital,” Khan said. “Military analysts are suggesting it may have been a way to keep pressure on the Ukrainians even as the talks were going on.”

Erdogan says unclear whether Turkey will buy more Russian arms

Turkey’s President Tayyip Erdogan has said it is too early to comment on Turkey’s possible purchase of more Russian weapons given Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

“Under the current circumstances, it would be premature to talk about what the future shows right now. We have to see what the conditions bring,” Erdogan said, speaking in Ankara alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

NATO member Turkey was handed US sanctions in December 2020 over its purchase of Russian S-400 missile defence systems and had been criticised by Western allies over the move. Ankara has said it was forced to opt for the Russian weapons because allies did not provide arms on satisfactory terms.

“If you don’t close our sky, it is only a matter of time before Russian rockets fall on your territory, on NATO territory,” Zelenskyy said in a video address.

Chechen leader Kadyrov says he travelled to Ukraine

Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of Russia’s Chechnya region, has said that he travelled into Ukraine to meet Chechen troops attacking Kyiv, the Reuters news agency has reported.

Reuters said it could not independently verify whether he was in Ukraine or had travelled there during the conflict.

Chechen state television channel Grozny posted a video on its Telegram social media channel that showed Kadyrov in a darkened room discussing with Chechen troops a military operation they said took place 7km (4 miles) from the Ukrainian capital, Reuters reported.

Bermuda revokes licences for Russian-operated planes

Bermuda’s aviation regulator has said it is suspending certification of all Russian-operated aircraft registered in the British overseas territory due to international sanctions over the war in Ukraine, in a move expected to affect more than 700 planes.

The regulator said it was unable to confidently approve the planes as airworthy due to the effect of sanctions on its ability to conduct safety oversight.

Manufacturers are no longer providing parts to Russian airlines as part of the sanctions.

Russian default no longer ‘improbable’

Russia may default on its debts in the wake of unprecedented sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine, but that would not trigger a global financial crisis, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has said.

Georgieva told CBS’s “Face the Nation” programme that sanctions imposed by the United States and other democracies were already having a “severe” effect on the Russian economy and would trigger a deep recession there this year.

The sanctions were limiting Russia’s ability to access its resources and service its debts, which meant a default was no longer viewed as “improbable,” the IMF official said.

Asked if such a default could trigger a financial crisis around the world, she said, “For now, no.”

‘Never heard of that’: China responds to reports Russia sought military help

The spokesperson for China’s embassy in Washington has responded to media reports that Moscow had asked Beijing for military equipment since launching its invasion of Ukraine by saying, “I’ve never heard of that.”

The spokesperson, Liu Pengyu, said China’s priority was to prevent the tense situation in Ukraine from getting out of control.

“The current situation in Ukraine is indeed disconcerting,” he said in an emailed response to an inquiry from the Reuters news agency.

“The high priority now is to prevent the tense situation from escalating or even getting out of control.”

ICRC issues stark Mariupol warning

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has warned that residents of the besieged port city of Mariupol face a “worst-case scenario” unless Russia and Ukraine reach an agreement to ensure their immediate safety and access to humanitarian aid.

Ukrainian authorities say the city has been subject to relentless bombardment since Russian troops surrounded it on March 2. Read the full story here.

Mariupol, which is located close to Russian-occupied Donbas, saw an ongoing barrage of artillery fire since Moscow invaded Ukraine on February 24. The next day, Russian troops headed on the city from the northwest but were stopped near the village of Pavlopil. Then the Russians encircled Mariupol from the north before connecting with troops that advanced on from the west, from Crimea (March 3). The city came under siege within a matter of days. Russian forces there include the 58th Army, the 3rd Guards Spetsnaz Brigade (a special brigade force of the Russian military intelligence), and the Sparta Battalion, which is a rebel militant group of what is called the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR). Ukrainian forces that defend the city include the 10th Mountain Assault Brigade, stationed at Bila Tserkva, the 56th Motorized Brigade, the 36th Marine Brigade, 46th Separate Special Purposes Battalion “Donbas-Ukraina,” the Azov Regiment (a unit of the National Guard of Ukraine), the 25th and the 37th Battalions, and the 109th Territorial Defense Brigade. The Russians on March 13 captured several towns northwest of Mariupol near the regions of Donetsk and Zaporizhia. This could potentially cut off Ukrainian forces that are stationed along the former demarcation line near the town of Volnovakha in Donbas. As in other major Ukrainian cities, Russian forces have not attacked Mariupol frontally. They cover Ukrainian-controlled districts with artillery fire and seize them gradually. The Russians have gained control of its eastern part. Now Mariupol is a number one target for Russian forces and a key priority in the Ukrainian defense strategy. In a video address posted to his Facebook page on March 13, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the high priority was to help the besieged city in its fight against the Russian invader. Deprived of the control of the port on the Sea of Azov, which allows for maritime trade from Donbas, Russia is unable to ensure a land route to the occupied Crimean peninsula. The city sits in a highly strategic position. If Russian forces capture Mariupol, they will gain control of the Ukrainian coast stretching to Mykolaiv, just west of Crimea. The town of Volnovakha, which is north of Mariupol, is of chief importance, too. Through the city runs the H20 highway that connects Mariupol, Donetsk, Kramatorsk, and Sloviansk. Running southwards, it is one of the key routes in Donbas. The eastern Ukrainian town of Volnovakha has been completely destroyed by Russian forces but Ukrainian soldiers are defending it to prevent the aggressor from sieging Mariupol even deeper than that. Ukrainian authorities have said that 1,500 civilians had been killed in Mariupol. The city is seeing more humanitarian convoys. Russian forces on March 12 blocked a humanitarian convoy that left the city of Zaporizhia. Nearly 125,000 people have been evacuated via humanitarian corridors from conflict zones in Ukraine so far. The roughly 400,000 people who remain in Mariupol have been left with no access to heat, food, and medicine. It was not until March 14 that some locals had been evacuated through a humanitarian route, heading on towards Berdyansk and then Zaporizhia. Earlier efforts to evacuate civilians from Mariupol were scuppered by ceasefire violations.",https://warsawinstitute.org/russian-invasion-ukraine-battle-mariupol-ukrainian-stalingrad/

Local government officials in this city in southern Ukraine, which has been controlled by Russian troops for the past two weeks, have been kicked out of their offices, and the local radio station plays Soviet ballads and Russian pop songs, interspersed with excerpts from Vladimir Putin’s speeches and news items about Ukraine being “liberated from Nazis.”

“We feel like we’re living a nightmare, and we don’t know when this awful dream will end,” said one local councillor in the city, who asked to remain anonymous, citing security fears. “We still can’t believe that this could have happened.”

As international focus remains on Kharkiv, Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities that have come under heavy Russian bombardment, there is a less violent but no less important battle for Ukraine’s future going on in a stretch of southern Ukraine that came under Russian control in the first days of the war, without major fighting.

Between Mariupol and Mykolaiv, both of which have come under Russian air attack, there are a number of sizable Ukrainian towns currently under Russian occupation.

Areas under Russian control Areas under Russian control

In Berdyansk, a port city to the west of Mariupol with a population of a little over 100,000, the majority of city councillors have remained loyal to Ukraine. They continue to run the city, in defiance of the Russian occupation. However, the Russians may be about to transition to more violent methods.

In nearby Melitopol, the similarly defiant mayor was reportedly kidnapped by Russian soldiers on Friday night, marched from his office with a bag over his head, and has not been heard from since.

01:33 Russian troops appear to kidnap Ukrainian mayor – video

Soon after, Galina Danilchenko, a local councillor affiliated with a traditionally pro-Russian political party, appeared with a video statement calling on locals not to resist the Russians. “Our main task right now is to adapt to the new reality, so that we can begin to live in a new way,” she said.

“They’re trying to set up their own authorities in the occupied cities,” said Olena Zhuk, chair of the council for Zaporizhzhia region, which contains both Melitopol and Berdyansk.

“They are trying to buy people out or find supporters in the current authorities, and the mayor of Melitopol, who refused to cooperate, was kidnapped. It’s absolutely unheard-of behaviour,” she said.

A Telegram channel set up by authorities in Berdyansk to communicate with locals gives a remarkable insight into how the Russian occupation unfolded on the ground.

On 26 February, two days after the Russian assault on Ukraine began, the acting mayor, Alexander Svidlo, made his first video address on the channel. Sitting at a desk, a houseplant behind him, Svidlo noted that “a column of Russian hardware is moving” in the direction of the town, and asked residents to stay calm.

The next day, residents were ordered to switch geolocation off on their mobile phones and remove any suspicious markings on trees or buildings that could be artillery target markers.

On the evening of 27 February, Svidlo appeared again, this time in a dark room, looking exhausted and shaken.

“A few hours ago, we all became witnesses of how heavy military hardware arrived on to the territory of our city,” he said. He explained that Russian soldiers had entered the city administration building.

“We were offered to continue our work but under the control of those people. I believe this to be unacceptable, and so we all left the building and are continuing to work from a distance,” he said. “I don’t know what will happen tomorrow.”

Svidlo and a majority of the city councillors moved from the building to continue their work elsewhere, in defiance of the Russians. At a council meeting held on 3 March, 28 of 38 councillors were present, according to one source who attended.

It seems the Russian army expected large segments of the population in places such as Berdyansk and Melitopol to welcome the Russian army as liberators, as happened in 2014 in Crimea.

“For years they have been lying to themselves that people in Ukraine were supposedly waiting for Russia to come,” said the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in a video address released over the weekend. “They did not find collaborators who would hand over the city and the power to the invaders.”

Many older residents of the region felt disfranchised in modern Ukraine, but these views have been changing gradually over the past decade, and then rapidly during the last two weeks of the Russian attack on Ukraine.

“Of course, there are some fans of the ‘Russian world’ among the population, but every day they are fewer and fewer. People can see that the ‘Russian world’ is not what Russian propaganda promises. It’s poverty, violence and destruction,” said Anna Ukrainska, a schoolteacher in Berdyansk.

In Berdyansk, as in many occupied cities, protests have drawn hundreds if not thousands of unarmed Ukrainians to the streets, often furiously shouting abuse at the Russian soldiers, who appear uncertain how to react.

In the town of Nova Kakhovka, Russian authorities threatened to cut off water and electricity if another protest was staged, according to one resident who attended a protest a week ago. Nevertheless, on Sunday a second protest took place in the town, as well as in numerous other cities.

“People came out with their children … there were also old people with walking sticks,” said Lera, a local woman who attended a protest in Kherson, a regional capital also currently under Russian control.



In a video from the protest sent by Lera, protesters can be seen walking past a column of Russian military vehicles, chanting “Russian fascist occupiers, out.” At one point the Russian soldiers start shooting into the air.

A counter-protest on the same day was organised by the Russians, said Lera, using people she believed were not local, and was filmed to create images suggesting Kherson was welcoming Russian troops.

Rumours have been spreading that the Russian occupying authorities are planning to stage a referendum in Kherson, similar to those held in Crimea and the Donbas in 2014 that provided a veneer of legitimacy for Russian actions.

Russian soldiers have set up checkpoints throughout the city, and Lera said two friends had told her that in the past few days the soldiers had started demanding to inspect the phones of those passing through.

In Berdyansk, Russians have also set up checkpoints on the outskirts of the city, preventing people from leaving. In any case, doing so would require a dangerous drive across the frontlines.

Supermarket shelves in the city are empty and there is a dangerous shortage of medicines. On Sunday evening, Svidlo posted that two city workers had managed to drive a van of medicines safely into the city, which would help save lives.

The mayor’s office is putting together a list of people who want to leave in the event that a humanitarian corridor can be agreed with the Russians, but so far there has been no agreement.

Each evening, residents listen to the voice of the Russians on the radio, who address the locals with promises of a happy new life and threaten criminal cases against Ukrainian officials. Many, however, remain sceptical of the promises.

“On the radio, they address people as ‘comrades’. They still live in the Soviet Union and they want to build it here. We have already moved ahead of them by several decades, we don’t need that,” said the local councillor.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/were-living-a-nightmare-life-in-russian-occupied-southern-ukraine

Now she and other residents are determined to show where their loyalties lie.

Chernyshova, 28, was among the hundreds who faced off with the Russian invaders to protest the war. Videos shared on social media last week and verified by NBC News showed crowds marching in Kherson, as well as in Nova Kakhovka and Melitopol in Ukraine’s south, carrying flags and shouting “go home” to the Russian troops.

“It was scary,” said Chernyshova, who works stints as a receptionist on international cruise ships, of the protests in which she has taken part. “You just don’t know what to expect from them.”

She was among the protesters who took to the streets in Kherson on Monday. She said the crowd marched toward the city council building now under Russian control, stopping within about 550 yards of the Russian soldiers. The Russians, who she said were armed and masked, did not move although some filmed the protesters, she added.

Such protests strike at the heart of Russia’s stated reason for invading Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin has used the pretext of protecting Russian speakers from what he termed “genocide” and oppression by the government in Kyiv to justify his invasion of Ukraine.

Chernyshova, a Russian speaker, and others were angered and alarmed by reports in the Russian state media suggesting that the residents of Kherson — a city of almost 300,000 that is a two-hour drive from Russian-annexed Crimea — welcomed the invading troops. This allegation shocked and angered many in the city who fear Russia will try to annex the region, where many people are bilingual but speak Russian as their first language.

Protests are now being planned every day in Kherson, Chernyshova said, and she plans to attend more in the future, although she understands the risks of showing her allegiance to Ukraine in a city full of Russian troops.

“We have become braver and stronger than on the first day,” she said. “We want to show that Kherson is Ukraine.”

The danger to protesters like Chernyshova becomes clearer every day.

On Wednesday, Kherson Mayor Ihor Kolykhayev said the Russian forces have been tightening their control over the city.

They had detained pro-Ukrainian activists and seized Kherson’s TV towers, giving them control over what information gets transmitted, he said. With food and medical supplies dwindling, he said the Russians have moved in humanitarian aid and some locals have started taking it out of desperation.

He added that the Russians had also been trying to persuade residents that the only safe way for them to avoid catastrophe was to go to Crimea, which is controlled by Russia, while not allowing exit corridors into Ukrainian territory.

Ukrainians throughout the country have taken strength from the show of defiance, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

“In the south of our country, such a national movement has unfolded, such a powerful manifestation of Ukrainianness that we have never seen in the streets and squares there,” he said in a video address Monday. “And for Russia, it’s like a nightmare.”

Some 130 miles east of Kherson is another largely Russian-speaking city — Melitopol in the Zaporizhzhya region — now also occupied by the Russian troops.

Ukrainian officials said Saturday that Ivan Fedorov, the mayor of the besieged city, was captured by Russian forces and later large crowds gathered to demand his release.

Unlike Kherson, the city has been spared and homes not shelled, resident Diana Karavai, 20, said by phone Tuesday. Still, she said, she’s had to hide in her bathroom with her family in case shelling begins at night. There are severe food shortages in the city and looting is commonplace, she said.

Like Kherson, though, residents of Melitopol have declared their allegiance to Ukraine.

Videos verified by NBC News showed people in the city yelling at the Russian military to leave and physically pushing Russian military vehicles as if to keep them from moving. The city has been holding daily pro-Ukrainian rallies, which Karavai, a nail studio owner, also attended.

She said it was important to her to make her position known because she wants her old life back.

“Imagine strangers coming into your town and telling you it’s actually theirs, not yours — even though you have lived here all your life, you had your children here, you built your business here, you had your friends here,” Karavai said. “That’s why we take to the streets — we don’t want to fight, we want to be left alone. We want things to be as they used to be.”

She said her city does not need protection from Russia.

“This is our country, this is our motherland,” Karavai said. “We don’t need to be rescued.”",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraines-russian-occupied-southern-cities-take-streets-show-defiance-rcna19171

In its scale and cost, as well as its broader implications for European and international security, Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine constitutes a new low in the foreign policy of Russian president Vladimir Putin.

But below the surface, Russia is also following established playbooks in how it deals with the areas it has taken control of. This has important implications for the war in Ukraine, how it might end, and how it might spread.

During the first days of war, Russia occupied Kherson region in southern Ukraine.

The Russian army did not encounter significant military resistance in the cities of Kherson, Skadovsk, Nova Kakhovka and was able to advance in columns through the Zaporizhzhia region (including the cities of Melitopol and Berdiansk, as well as the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant) to Mariupol.

Here, Russia encountered fierce resistance and has subjected the city to a brutal siege.

In Kherson region, however, things played out differently. Once occupied, the Russian military called on the local Ukrainian authorities to cooperate with them and announced their intention to hold a referendum on the proclamation of the Kherson People's Republic.

Residents of the cities of Kherson, Melitopol and Berdiansk responded with civil disobedience and organised peaceful protests of many thousands through social networks under the slogan My city is Ukrainian! On March 12, 2022, the democratically elected Kherson Regional Council adopted a resolution proclaiming the planned referendum illegal.

In response, the Russian military has targeted elected officials and Ukrainian civil servants in these newly occupied territories.

This has included the kidnapping of the mayors of Melitopol and Dniprorudne.

In Melitopol, the Russian occupation forces then appointed a new mayor, Galina Danilchenko, a local deputy from the so-called Opposition Bloc, constituted from the remnants of former pro-Russian president Victor Yanukovych's Party of the Regions.

Helped by Russian occupation forces and their local proxies terrorising the civilian population, Danilchenko and others with similar pro-Russian leanings have now become increasingly vocal in their demands that local authorities either cooperate or be replaced by people willing to do so.

This is an almost exact reenactment of what happened in the Donbas region in 2014.

Here, Russia's little green men used a combination of intimidation and brutal force to oust incumbent local officials and replace them with representatives of marginal groups willing to cooperate with the occupying power.

This strategy of societal destabilisation initially aims at the physical removal from power of elected local elites.

It then targets public servants, liberal intellectuals, journalists and other opinion leaders and the middle class in general. Russia has a frightening track record of efficiency in this regard, using widely publicised intimidation, torture and execution of local leaders among its tools.

In the context of Donbas in 2014, the Paris-based International Federation for Human Rights, concluded that these tactics may constitute crimes against humanity under Article 7 of the Rome Statute.

Writ large, this might also be how Putin imagines Ukraine's denazification that is, the replacement of the country's democratically elected government with his own marionettes.

While this does not bode well for civilians in Ukrainian territories newly occupied by Russia, it also has important implications for the further course of the war both in Ukraine and beyond.

At least a part of Russian strategy appears to be the establishment of more de facto states according to the 2014 Donbas playbook.

This will give Russia increased leverage over these occupied territories through their proxies.

It will simultaneously allow the Kremlin to deny any responsibility for fulfilling its obligations as an occupying power towards the civilian population of these areas and for any war crimes committed there.

As Russia expands its control of territory, the illegally occupied parts of Ukraine are likely to resemble a patchwork of unrecognised self-proclaimed statelets.

These will be unstable in themselves while creating instability along the lines of contact with Ukrainian-controlled territory. Like the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk republics after 2014, they could also be used as bargaining chips in future negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv.

Russia's societal destabilisation playbook also offers a potential blueprint for how and where the war might spread.

There has been much discussion about the threats to Moldova. One scenario here might be the enacting of Russia's playbook in the autonomous region of Gagauzia in southern Moldova, where Moscow wields some influence.

In the south Caucasus, Georgia's Adjara region, where Russia used to have a military base in the regional capital Batumi, might be another target. But any Russian move in this direction is risky and not guaranteed to succeed, given, for example, Turkey's considerable links with both regions.

Success can be measured in different ways, however. From Russia's perspective, creating more instability in other parts of the post-Soviet region might be enough, for now.

It would be a signal to Moldova and Georgia and their partners in the EU and Nato that Russia has the capacity to be disruptive and can escalate as and when it wants to.

This is also the main danger for the Baltic states especially Latvia and Estonia, which have large, concentrated ethnic Russian and Russian-speaking minorities.

Russia may not risk a direct intervention there, but the kind of deniable subversive activities that form at least part of the early Russian playbook are important to watch out for, to call out, and to counter decisively.

Russia says it's taken 'full control' of Kherson and surrounding region of 1m people

Russia has claimed to have taken full control of Kherson Oblast in south Ukraine in what would be a major moment in the war if confirmed.

Russia's defence ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenov said the country's forces had taken full control of all territory in Ukraine's southern Kherson region, Russian news agencies reported.

The claims have yet to be independently confirmed.

Kherson city was taken at the beginning of March, leaving 300,000 citizens to live under the rule of Russian occupiers.

Now the Russian military is claiming to have full control of the broader Kherson region, which has a population of more than a million people.

This weekend Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky warned that the Russians wanted to turn Kherson into a pseudo-breakaway state, like Donbass.

Kherson Oblast also includes strategically important port town Kakhovka and river port Nova Kakhovka.

The region is known as the country's fruit basket and is an important area for both Ukraine and Europe more broadly due to the huge amount of food grown there.

Russia has had much more success invading Ukraine from the south - with its forces moving up through occupied Crimea into Kherson - than in the north.

To the east of the region lies Zaporizhzhia Oblast, where the port city of Berdiansk, urban hub Melitopol and large nuclear power plant Zaporizhzhia have fallen to the Russians.

The citizens of Kherson city have ignored warnings from the Russian occupiers to stay inside over the past two weeks, instead opting to protest their presence on the streets.

On March 5 2,000 people came out to demonstrate, waving the flag and singing the Ukrainian anthem.

Locals yelled “Glory to Ukraine ” and “Death to the enemy” as Russian troops fired bullets into the air.

Eyewitnesses said Russian troops fired automatic rifles in a failed bid to disperse the crowd.

The soldiers later left the city centre, the eyewitnesses said.

At the weekend more than 100 people came out in Kakhovka to demand that the Russians leave and chant ""one, united, free Ukraine"" while draped in their country's flag.

The situation in Kherson city has become bleak over the past week, according to people living there.

Food is in short supply and the Russian police carefully monitor people's social media feeds to ensure they're not being too overtly pro-Ukrainian.

Shortages of medicine and food in the occupied city have left vulnerable people waiting to die, according to civilians living there.

Shops are open but supplies are not getting through.

Over the weekend President Zelensky warned that the Russians were attempting to take control of the region as they had Donbass.

308,7f88fee5-6355-4995-a7b9-35702c0f189d,[],,"Geneva-Brussels, March 16, 2022 – As the Russian Federation extends its control of Ukrainian territories a systematic policy of grave human rights violations is unfolding. At least six cases of enforced disappearances and four extrajudicial killings of civilians have been documented in the recently occupied regions of Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Kyiv and Luhansk. These patterns are similar to those already documented in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine since 2014, where torture, kidnappings and executions have become the norm under Russian occupation.

As the Russian army secures control over some territories in Ukraine, the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and its Ukrainian partners have documented at least six cases of enforced disappearances and incommunicado arbitrary detention, as well as at least four extrajudicial executions of journalists, human rights defenders and representatives of local authorities in March 2022 alone. This very worrying trend indicates that the Russian forces may be as negligent of human rights in the occupation of these territories as they were during the conflict, when the army shelled civilians and humanitarian corridors.

Grave human rights violations targeting human rights defenders, journalists and activists

On March 12, 2022, Oleg Baturin, a Ukrainian journalist working for the Novy Den newspaper and member of the National Union of Journalists of Ukraine (NUJU), was allegedly abducted by Russian soldiers in the Kherson region. At about 4 pm, Oleg Baturin received a call from an acquaintance who proposed to meet him at a bus station located near the journalist’s house, in the town of Kakhovka. Oleg Baturin left his phone and documents at home, and promised to be back in 20 minutes. The journalist’s whereabouts have remained unknown since then. On the same day, at around 4:50 pm, Russian soldiers were seen by locals near the Kakhovka bus station, where Oleg Baturin was supposed to meet his acquaintance.

On the same day, a pro-Ukrainian activist and journalist Serhiy Tsyhipa disappeared in the neighbouring town of Nova Kakhovka, in the Kherson region. Serhiy Tsyhipa left home with his dog at 10 am. The dog was later found tied up near the building of the town executive committee. Serhiy Tsyhipa has not been in touch since then, and his family has no official information about his whereabouts. His daughter found out that he was being held in detention in Kherson in order to prevent him from spreading unwanted information about the war in the region. Before his enforced disappearance he covered the news of the occupied town.

On March 11, 2022, at 3 pm, the Russian military abducted Ivan Fedorov, the Mayor of Melitopol town, by breaking into the town hall. According to the Mayor’s Office of Melitopol, the Russian military pulled a black plastic bag over Fedorov’s head, forced him out of his office, put him in a car and drove him away in an unknown direction. This version seemed to be corroborated by a video from security cameras. On March 14, 2022, the Ukrainian authorities reported that Ivan Fedorov was detained in the occupied town of Luhansk and was charged with “terrorism”. It should be noted that, shortly before his arrest, Ivan Fedorov refused to issue a statement legitimizing the Russian invasion. On March 16, 2022, the Office of the President of Ukraine reported that Ivan Fedorov was released in exchange for 9 captured Russian soldiers.

On March 12, 2022, Olga Haisumova, Head of the NGO ""Melitopol Conscious Society"" and one of organizers of a pro-Ukrainian protest in occupied Melitopol, was kidnapped by Russian soldiers straight from the protest rally in Melitopol . Her whereabouts have remained unknown since then. NGO ""Melitopol Conscious Society"" conducted charitable collections of food and financial support for the Ukrainian army, and coordinated civil actions in support of the sovereignty of Ukraine.

According to Ukrainian media reports, rallies against the Russian invasion have been met with violence. Russian troops tried to disperse protesters by shooting in the air. One participant to a pro-Ukrainian rally in Kherson was wounded in the leg by a rubber bullet.

Grave human rights violations targeting Ukrainian political representatives

Ukrainian media report that on the morning of March 13, 2022, the Head of the Melitopol District Council Serhiy Pryima was detained by eight Russian military men who broke into his apartment to conduct a raid. During the raid, the military confiscated all his documents and mobile devices, and demanded his passwords. After the raid, the Russian military took Serhiy Pryyma away in an unknown direction. His whereabouts have remained unknown since then.

On March 13, 2022, the Head of the Zaporizhzhia Regional State Administration announced that the Russian military had kidnapped Yevhen Matveyev, the Mayor of the Dniprorudne town in the Zaporizhzhia Region. On March 14, 2022, Ukrainian authorities reported that his whereabouts remained unknown.

Member of Parliament Dmytro Lubinets informed Ukrainian human rights organisations about the detention by the Russian military of more than 20 pro-Ukrainian activists in the city of Volnovakha in the Donetsk region. Their names are unknown and this information could not be verified upon publication of this note.

Cases of extrajudicial executions of local politicians and civil activists have also been confirmed in the Kyiv and Luhansk regions.

The local self-government body of the Gostomel village, in the Kyiv region, reported that on March 7, 2022, Yuriy Prylypko, the Head of this local self-government, was shot dead by the Russian military along with two volunteers Ruslan Karpenko and Ivan Zorya, while they were delivering food and medicine to local residents.

On March 13, 2022, the Head of the Luhansk Regional State Administration reported that the Russian military had killed pro-Ukrainian activist Oleksandr Kononov, who was shot dead in his wheelchair in his home near Severodonetsk city, Luhansk region.

Conclusions and recommendations

The above-mentioned attacks seem to demonstrate that in the territories under Russian military control, two groups of civilians are particularly targeted: 1) local authorities or opinion leaders who openly oppose collaboration with the occupiers, and 2) pro-Ukrainian activists and humanitarian volunteers who provide assistance to the civilian population.

The OMCT recalls that similar attacks have been documented in Russian-occupied Crimea and eastern Ukraine since 2014.

More wide-scale persecution of civilian population is to be feared in the territories fallen under Russian control, in the form of attacks, enforced disappearances, torture and extrajudicial executions.

We call on the international community to urge the authorities of the Russian Federation to:

Immediately and unconditionally release all the above-mentioned persons; Guarantee in all circumstances their physical integrity and psychological well-being as well as that of all civilians, including human rights defenders, pro-Ukrainian activists, journalists and representatives of local self-government bodies in Ukrainian territories under Russian control; Ensure international monitoring and humanitarian work in Ukraine without any hindrance or reprisals.

We further call on the international community to provide support to Ukrainian non-governmental organisations in all forms relevant in the present-day situation of armed conflict.",https://www.omct.org/en/resources/statements/ukraine-grave-human-rights-violations-in-territories-under-recent-russian-control

Speaking to thousands of people in St Peter’s Square for his Sunday blessing, Francis also said the killing of children and unarmed civilians was “barbaric” and had “no valid strategic reason”.

He called besieged Mariupol a “martyred city” and again appealed for “truly secure humanitarian corridors” to allow residents to leave.

“In the name of God, I ask you: stop this massacre,” the pope said, adding that Ukrainian cities risked “being reduced to cemeteries”.

The pope has not used the word “Russia” in his condemnations of the war since Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion on 24 February. However, his choice of words, such as “armed aggression” and “no valid strategic reason”, appeared to be aimed at contesting Moscow’s justifications for the invasion.

Russia calls its action a “special military operation”. Last Sunday Francis implicitly rejected that term, saying it could not be considered “just a military operation” but a war that had unleashed “rivers of blood and tears”.

Moscow says its action is designed not to occupy territory but to demilitarise and “denazify” its neighbour. It has denied targeting civilian areas.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/13/pope-francis-condemns-invasion-of-ukraine-russia

Pope Francis turns his attention, yet again, to the war in Ukraine inviting the faithful to join him, and bishops throughout the world, in prayer on 25 March to ask the Lord, through the intercession of Our Lady, for the gift of peace.

By Linda Bordoni

“I would like to take a minute to remember the victims of the war. The news of displaced persons, of people fleeing, of people killed, people wounded, of so many soldiers fallen on both sides, is news of death,” said Pope Francis at the conclusion of the General Audience.

Addressing the faithful after his weekly catechesis, the Pope said: “We ask the Lord of life to deliver us from this death of war.”

“With war everything is lost, everything. There is no victory in a war: everything is defeated.”

And he invoked the Lord “to send His Spirit to make us understand that war is a defeat for humanity, which we need to defeat, all of us.”

May the Spirit make us understand, the Pope continued, “that waging war is a need that destroys us,” and he prayed that we be delivered “from this need for self-destruction.”

“We pray, too, for leaders to understand that buying weapons and making weapons is not the solution to the problem.”

The solution, Pope Francis concluded, is to work together for peace and, as the Bible says, to turn weapons into instruments for peace,” and he asked those present to join him in prayer to Our Lady.",https://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2022-03/pope-francis-audience-appeal-peace-prayer-war-ukraine-russia.html
311,b70d57ad-f2be-4709-be20-08f2e6b09afb,[],,"In the 1980s Bergoglio served as a seminary teacher and rector and pursued graduate studies in theology in Germany . In 1992 he was appointed an auxiliary bishop of Buenos Aires. He was named archbishop of Buenos Aires (a post he held until his election to the papacy) in 1998 and was consecrated a cardinal in 2001. During the economic crisis in Argentina beginning in the late 1990s, which culminated in 2002 in the rapid devaluation of the country’s currency, Bergoglio acquired a public reputation for humility, living in a simple downtown apartment rather than in the archbishop’s residence and traveling by public transportation or by foot rather than in a chauffeured limousine. He became an outspoken advocate for the poor and an able politician, deftly promoting the church’s position on social matters in meetings with government officials. His theological conservatism , however, set him at odds with the centre-left administrations of Pres. Néstor Kirchner (2003–07) and his wife and successor, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (2007–15). Bergoglio was a particularly vocal critic of Fernández’s social initiatives , including the legalization of same-sex marriage in 2010. Fernández in turn depicted Bergoglio as a right-wing extremist and a supporter of the Videla dictatorship.

Bergoglio’s tenure as head of the country’s Jesuits coincided with the military coup in Argentina (1976) led by Lieut. Gen. Jorge Rafael Videla . During the ensuing Dirty War (1976–83), a campaign by the country’s military dictatorship against leftists and other perceived subversives, between 10,000 and 30,000 people were disappeared (kidnapped, tortured, and usually killed) by the military and the police. Bergoglio later claimed to have hidden several people from the authorities, even helping some of them to flee the country. In 1976 two Jesuit priests who had worked in poor neighbourhoods were disappeared; they were found alive, but drugged, in a field five months later. Years after the Dirty War, Bergoglio’s role in the priests’ kidnapping and release generated controversy. Some critics faulted Bergoglio for failing to protect the priests and even accused him of turning the men over to the regime. Others accepted Bergoglio’s claim that he covertly interceded with the regime to secure their eventual release. A lawsuit against Bergoglio charging him with complicity in the priests’ disappearance was ultimately dismissed.

Bergoglio was the son of Italian immigrants to Argentina . After studying in high school to become a chemical technician, he worked briefly in the food-processing industry but felt called to the church. When he was about 21 years old, he suffered a severe bout of pneumonia that led to the removal of part of his right lung. He entered the Jesuit novitiate in 1958 and then turned to academics, studying humanities in Santiago , Chile, and earning a licentiate (equivalent to a master’s degree) in philosophy in Buenos Aires province. After graduation he taught literature and psychology in high school while pursuing a degree in theology . He was ordained a priest in 1969, took his final vows in the Jesuit order in 1973, and subsequently served as superior (head) of the Jesuit province of Argentina (1973–79).

Papacy

In February 2013 Pope Benedict XVI resigned, citing old age and health concerns. A conclave was convened in early March, spurring hopes that Benedict’s replacement could be elected and installed before the impending Easter holiday. Bergoglio was elected on the fifth ballot and chose the name Francis, in honour of St. Francis of Assisi (1181/82–1226), who lived a life of humble service to the poor, and also recalling St. Francis Xavier (1506–52), a founding member of the Jesuits. Although he was the first Pope Francis and was widely referred to as “Francis I,” he declined to use the Roman numeral I to indicate that he was the first to use his papal name. (Traditionally, the numeral I is not added to a pope’s name until after a second pope of the same name has been elected. John Paul I [1978] was the first pope to use the numeral during his reign.)

Francis took charge of a church at a crossroads. In the early 21st century Roman Catholics constituted more than one-sixth of the world’s population, many of them in Latin America and Africa. Yet scandals, particularly the clergy sexual-abuse scandals that first arose in the 1980s and ’90s, had undermined the church’s stature, particularly in the United States and Europe. In his earliest public addresses and in his first public mass, Francis called for spiritual renewal within the church and greater attention to the plight of the poor, and he sternly condemned the forces that diverted the church from its ministry and set it at risk of becoming a “pitiful NGO.” He also reached out to his political opponents, including Fernández, whom he invited to his first official papal address. Yet he incensed some traditionalists by appearing on that occasion in a simple tunic rather than in the more-traditional papal garments. He also took the unprecedented step later in 2013 of appointing a council of eight cardinals to advise him on church policy. His remark in that year that Christ had “redeemed all of us,” even non-Catholics, were broadly interpreted by the media as a message of outreach and goodwill toward atheists and agnostics, though a Vatican spokesman later claimed that Francis had been misinterpreted.

Francis soon became noted for making statements that similarly conveyed an openness to different perspectives on Catholic doctrine, particularly regarding social issues and sexual ethics. Such statements were subsequently either toned down by the Vatican or seemingly contradicted by Francis himself. For example, Francis surprised both liberals and traditionalists when in a September 2013 interview with an Italian Jesuit magazine he criticized the church for having been “obsessed” with issues such as homosexuality, abortion, and birth control. That remark encouraged speculation both within and outside the church that a major shift in Catholic teaching and practice on such matters as same-sex marriage and contraception would follow. Yet in the following year Francis spoke out against same-sex marriage and defended the “traditional” family. Moreover, he affirmed the church’s categorical opposition to abortion. Although Francis spoke sympathetically of women’s rights and acknowledged women’s historic role in the church, he did not endorse the ordination of women as priests.

The lingering effects of the church’s sexual-abuse scandal constituted another challenge facing Francis’s papacy. During a visit by Dutch bishops in December 2013, Francis prayed for victims of sexual abuse and urged the bishops to reach out to them and their families. In January 2014 the United Nations (UN) Commission on the Rights of the Child recommended that the Vatican adopt procedures for the mandatory reporting of suspected child abusers to law-enforcement authorities but was rebuffed later that year on jurisdictional grounds. Critics observed that the Vatican was slow to punish and defrock priests who were known pedophiles.

A central dimension of Francis’s papacy was championing the poor and oppressed, and from the start he promoted a broad ministry that aimed to include not only non-Catholic Christians but even non-Christians. He drew traditionalists’ ire soon after taking office when he washed the feet of two young women, including a Muslim, in a juvenile detention centre during the traditional Maundy Thursday reenactment of Jesus’ washing of the feet of the Twelve Apostles. (Church tradition held that women could not participate in the ceremony because the Apostles were men.) In November 2013 he issued Evangelii Gaudium (“The Joy of the Gospel”), an apostolic exhortation in which he denounced economic inequality and called upon the church to embrace its global diversity. In August 2014 Francis publicly denounced the alleged persecutions of Christians and religious minorities such as the Yazīdīs by the transnational Sunni insurgent group the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL; also called the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria [ISIS]).

In June 2015 Francis issued Laudato si’ (“Praise be to you”), the first encyclical of his papacy. Laudato si’ proclaimed that environmental degradation was “a moral issue” spurred by greed and unchecked capitalism, which caused human beings to lose sight of the relationships that bound them together and to neglect Earth, their “common home.” Promoting the concept of “integral ecology,” Francis connected sinful actions against the natural world with the economic exploitation of impoverished human beings and the denigration of human rights. The document was also noteworthy for its endorsement of the rights of indigenous peoples. However, it polarized many Catholics, especially in the United States.

Three months after issuing Laudato si’, Francis made his first visit to the United States, where he became the first pope to address the U.S. Congress. He once again courted controversy by holding the first canonization mass in the U.S. in honour of Junípero Serra, an 18th-century Spanish missionary whose role in the colonization of the Americas had been criticized by indigenous-rights groups. In New York City, Francis addressed the UN General Assembly and urged the world’s leaders to promote peace. He concluded his tour in Philadelphia, with an address before the World Meeting of Families and an open-air Spanish-language mass. In February 2016 he and Kirill I, patriarch of Moscow and All Russia, held the first-ever meeting between the leaders of the Roman Catholic and Russian Orthodox churches.

In April 2016 Francis issued his second exhortation, Amoris laetitia (“The Joy of Love”), a wide-ranging pronouncement on family issues. In it he urged priests and bishops to take a more welcoming, and less judgmental, attitude toward homosexuals, single parents, and the divorced who remarried but who had not obtained an annulment, indicating in the latter case that such Catholics might be permitted to receive Holy Communion through the guidance of a priest. He did not, however, lift their formal exclusion from the sacrament, and he reaffirmed the church’s rejection of same-sex marriage and of contraception.

In August 2018 Francis revised the catechism of the Catholic church to fully reject the death penalty. Formerly, capital punishment was permitted when it was seen as the only means of defending human lives against an unjust aggressor. The revision states that the death penalty is “inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person.” Long a vocal critic of the death penalty, Francis said that the church would work to abolish capital punishment worldwide.

In February 2019 Francis became the first pope ever to visit the Arabian Peninsula, the birthplace of Islam, in a trip meant to promote religious fraternity and peace. In his three-day visit to Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, he attended the Global Conference on Human Fraternity and met with Grand Imam Ahmed al-Tayeb, the head of Cairo’s Al-Azhar Mosque and one of the highest authorities in Sunni Islam. He also celebrated a papal mass attended by an estimated 180,000 people, many of whom were Christian immigrants, in what was the largest display of Christian worship in the country’s history.",https://www.britannica.com/biography/Francis-I-pope

He did not say how long the pope would be hospitalized, but the Italian media reported that he would remain at the hospital for several days.

It is the first time that Francis has been admitted to a hospital since becoming pope in 2013, and it comes at a time of tension in the church, with the Vatican this week indicting officials on charges of financial crimes, American bishops last month essentially disregarding Rome’s appeal to hold off on a politically fraught document about the Eucharist, and many in the church confused by Francis’ new warm words to L.G.B.T.Q. Catholics even as his church continues to hold a hard line.

Through it all, Francis, whose pontificate has been built around his personal style, charisma and expressed desire to reinvigorate the church, has stayed put and kept the power center with him in the Vatican. Unlike his predecessors, he has never left the Vatican for the cooler papal residence in Castel Gandolfo, near Rome, during the summer. He normally slows down his schedule in July.

Two days ago, Mr. Bruni announced that the weekly general audiences held on Wednesdays would be suspended for the month of July, and begin again on Aug. 4. He said the Sunday Angelus prayer and blessing would continue throughout the summer.

On Wednesday, March 9, a Russian strike on a maternity hospital in Mariupol killed at least three people and injured at least 17, according to local officials. Amid heavy loss of life in the city, there have been reports of civilians being buried in mass graves.

Pope Francis said that Mariupol, a city of 400,000 which was founded and named for the Virgin Mary, “has become a city martyred” amid the assault.

“Faced with the barbarism of the killing of children, and of innocent and defenseless citizens, there are no strategic reasons that hold up: the only thing to be done is to cease the unacceptable armed aggression before the city is reduced to a cemetery,” the pope said.

The pope’s words echoed those of a prominent Catholic leader in Ukraine, Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk, who lamented March 10 what he described as the “mass murder” of Ukrainians following Russia’s full-scale invasion. The following day, March 11, Shevchuk said the assault is “becoming a war primarily against the civilian, peaceful population.”

He issued his strongest words yet about Russia’s war against Ukraine during his Sunday Angelus from St. Peter’s Square.

Referring to the city of Mariupol, heavily bombarded this week by the Russian army that destroyed a maternity ward, a cancer hospital, a mosque and countless homes, Francis said that “it has become a martyred city of this heartbreaking war that is devastating Ukraine.”

“God is God of peace,” Francis said. “Those who use it to justify violence profane his name.”

The pope also asked for “safe and effective” humanitarian corridors, thanked the thousands of volunteers who are helping the millions of refugees who have already fled Ukraine, and urged diocesan and religious communities to “increase the moments of prayer for peace.”

Remembering the victims in Ukraine, Pope Francis makes another heartfelt appeal for a ceasefire in the war-torn nation.

By Vatican News staff writer

At the conclusion of the Sunday Angelus, Pope Francis recalled that the faithful had just prayed to the Virgin Mary, as the city that bears her name, Mariupol, has ""become a city of martyrs in the terrible war ravaging Ukraine.""

The Pope expressed horror over the barbarity of the killing of children, innocents and unarmed civilians, and called for an end to the unacceptable armed aggression, before it reduces cities to cemeteries.

""With pain in my heart, I join my voice to that of the common people, who implore an end to the war,"" he said.

“In the name of God, let the cries of those who suffer be heard and let the bombings and attacks cease! Let there be a real and decisive focus on negotiation, and let the humanitarian corridors be effective and safe. In the name of God, I ask you: stop this massacre!”

Welcoming fleeing Christ

The Pope asked for the many people who have fled Ukraine to be welcomed, saying ""Christ is present"" in them.

He also expressed his gratitude for the great network of solidarity that has sprung up in response to the millions fleeing the war in Ukraine.

The Pope requested that all diocesan and religious communities increase their efforts in praying for peace.

“God is only God of peace. He is not God of war, and those who support violence profane His name.”

In conclusion, Pope Francis invited everyone present in St. Peter's Square to pray in silence for those suffering and for God to convert hearts to a firm will for peace.

The head of the Catholic Church prayed to the Virgin Mary and the city that bears her name - Mariupol.

He said the Mariupol has become a city of martyrs in the ongoing war in Ukraine.

More than 1,500 people have died in the besieged city and the deputy mayor claimed the area had been 'totally destroyed'.

Thousands of its inhabitants remain without food, water, electricity or heat as relentless shelling continued to blast shops and residential apartments.

Russia bombed a children’s and maternity hospital on Wednesday in Mariupol, killing at least three people, including a six-year-old girl.

The Catholic leader also dispatched two cardinals to Ukraine last week in an unusual move, saying that 'the Holy See is willing to do everything to put itself in service for peace.

The papal almsgiver, Cardinal Konrad Krajewski, a Polish priest, has been dispatched with aid, along with Cardinal Michael Czerny, who is head of the papal office that deals with migration, charity, justice and peace.

In his February 27 address, the first after the invasion began, Pope Francis' focus was still on humanitarian corridors and the innocent civilians.

He said: 'Those who wage war, those who provoke war, forget humanity. They do not start from the people, they do not look at the real life of people, but place partisan interests and power before all else.

'They trust in the diabolical and perverse logic of weapons, which is the furthest from the will of God. And they distance themselves from ordinary people, who want peace, and who are the real victims in every conflict, who pay for the follies of war with their own skin.

'I think of the elderly, of those who are seeking refuge in these hours, of mothers fleeing with their children… They are brothers and sisters for whom it is urgent to open humanitarian corridors, and who should be welcomed.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10607929/I-ask-stop-massacre-Pope-Francis-condemns-barbaric-killing-children-Ukraine.html
