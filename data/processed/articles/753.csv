0,121e05d9-4461-4895-8efa-09e3350278a5,[],,"Additional Guidance Issued to Prevent Sanctions Evasion and Implement New Executive Order

WASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued a new round of sanctions targeting Russian and Kremlin elites, oligarchs, and Russia’s political and national security leaders who have supported Russian President Vladimir Putin’s brutal and illegal invasion of Ukraine.

Today’s actions include designating regime elites and business executives who are associates and facilitators of the Russian regime, including three immediate family members of President Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitriy Sergeevich Peskov; Russian tycoon and Kremlin insider Viktor Vekselberg; and the Management Board of the sanctioned VTB Bank. Additionally, OFAC designated 12 members of the Russian State Duma, including Vyacheslav Victorovich Volodin, who is also a permanent member of Russia’s Security Council.

OFAC is also issuing guidance, in line with today’s G7 leaders statement, to guard against potential attempts to use virtual currency to evade U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia. All of these actions complement a new Executive Order issued today by President Biden that imposes new import and export restrictions on Russia, including the export of U.S. banknotes to Russia. Finally, OFAC is also issuing guidance and authorizations to implement the President’s new Executive Order.

“Treasury continues to hold Russian officials to account for enabling Putin’s unjustified and unprovoked war,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “Today’s actions also further isolates the severely damaged Russian economy by prohibiting trade in products that are key to the economic and financial interests of all Russian elites.”

TARGETING PUTIN ENABLERS AND ELITES

Family of Dmitriy Peskov, Kremlin Spokesman

On March 3, 2022, the U.S. State Department designated Dmitriy Sergeevich Peskov (Peskov), identified as the lead propagandist and spokesperson of the Russian Federation. Peskov was designated pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 14024 for being or having been an official of the Government of the Russian Federation (GoR). Australia, Canada, and the European Union (EU) have also sanctioned Peskov.

Today, OFAC is designating three of Peskov’s family members, all of whom live luxurious lifestyles that are incongruous with Peskov’s civil servant salary and are likely built on the ill-gotten wealth of Peskov’s connections to Putin.

Peskov’s wife, Tatiana Aleksandrovna Navka (Navka), has a property empire worth more than $10 million. Her real estate includes property in an elite Moscow suburb where Putin also lives, another multimillion-dollar apartment in Moscow given to her by the GoR, and an apartment in Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula, which Russia has occupied since 2014. She first gained notoriety when she won a gold medal in ice dancing representing Russia at the 2006 Winter Olympics and later hosted an ice dancing show on Russia’s state-owned pro-Kremlin Channel One.

Treasury also designated Peskov’s two adult children, Nikolay Peskov (Nikolay) and Elizaveta Dmitriyevna Peskova (Liza). Nikolay grew up in the United Kingdom but moved back to Russia to serve in the army, and later worked for the Russian propaganda outlet RT. Nikolay reportedly has access to a number of luxury vehicles and travels on private aircraft and yachts. Liza has tens of thousands of followers on social media, where she displays her luxurious lifestyle. She previously interned for a member of the European Parliament who publicly supported Russia’s attempted annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region.

Navka, Nikolay, and Liza are all being designated today pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being a spouse or adult child of Peskov, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024.

A Network Close to the Kremlin

Viktor Feliksovich Vekselberg (Vekselberg) is a prominent Russian businessman with an estimated net worth exceeding $6 billion who was previously designated on April 6, 2018 pursuant to E.O. 13662 for operating in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy. Vekselberg’s extensive holdings, predominantly consolidated through his designated Renova Group of companies, span multiple sectors of the Russian Federation economy, and are intertwined with some of the GoR’s global initiatives, such as the Rusnano Group, one of the largest technological investors in Russia which provides a revenue source to the GoR.

Vekselberg has maintained close ties with leading GoR officials, including Putin and former Russian President, Dmitry Medvedev (Medvedev). Medvedev personally appointed Vekselberg to serve as director and president of the Skolkovo Foundation (SF), a GoR initiative aimed at creating a Russian version of Silicon Valley in order to elevate Russia’s international status as a leading innovation center for technological developments. Following his prior designation, Vekselberg no longer holds this position with SF. Furthermore, Vekselberg has taken part in Russian diplomatic and soft power activities on behalf of the Kremlin, accompanying GoR officials on cultural missions abroad.

As part of today’s action, OFAC is identifying as blocked property two of Vekselberg’s luxury assets: an aircraft with tail number P4-MIS and a yacht titled Tango. P4-MIS is an Airbus A319-115 with serial number 3133 registered in Aruba. Vekselberg’s yacht, Tango, is flagged in the Cook Islands, a self-governing island country in the South Pacific Ocean in free association with New Zealand, with IMO number 1010703, and gross registered tonnage of 2,083. Both P4-MIS and Tango are valued at approximately $90 million each for a total of $180 million in identified blocked property.

Vekselberg’s P4-MIS jet, valued at approximately $90 million.1

Vekselberg is being redesignated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the GoR, and also for operating or having operated in the technology sector of the Russian Federation economy.

VTB Bank’s Management Board

On February 24, 2022, Treasury designated VTB Bank, Russia’s second largest bank, pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being owned or controlled by, or for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the GoR, and for operating or having operated in the financial services sector of the Russian Federation economy. Today, OFAC is designating the ten individuals comprising VTB Bank’s management board.

Olga Konstantinovna Dergunova

Vadim Valerievich Kulik

Valerii Vasilyevich Lukyanenko

Anatolii Yuryevich Pechatnikov

Natalia Germanovna Dirks

Maxim Dmitrievich Kondratenko

Erkin Rakhmatovich Norov

Svyatoslav Evgenievich Ostrovsky

Dmitrii Vasilyevich Pyanov

Yuriy Nikolaevich Andresov

All ten individuals were designated pursuant to E.O 14024 for being or having been leaders, officials, senior executive officers, or members of the board of directors of the GoR and for operating or having operated in the financial services sector of the Russian Federation economy.

Vyacheslav Volodin and Members of the Russian State Duma

Today, in alignment with measures taken by international partners, OFAC designated twelve members of the Duma. The Duma is one of two chambers of the Russian Federal Assembly, Russia’s legislature. Following months of Russia’s buildup of military forces on the Ukrainian border, in February 2022, the Duma voted in favor of sending a resolution to Putin to recognize the independence of two separatist-held territories in eastern Ukraine, the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) and Luhansk People’s Republic (LNR), which was a blatant violation of Ukrainian sovereignty.

Specifically, 11 members of the Duma signed a letter to the Duma’s speaker and member of the pro-Kremlin ruling United Russia Party, Vyacheslav Victorovich Volodin (Volodin), lobbying for Putin’s recognition of these two separatist republics. Volodin is a permanent member of the Russian Security Council and was previously designated on April 28, 2014, pursuant to E.O. 13661 for being an official of the GoR. Volodin signed the resolution and Putin ultimately announced his decision to recognize the independence of the so-called DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine. Shortly thereafter, Putin falsely accused Ukraine of committing genocide against Russian nationals and sent so-called peacekeepers into the DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine, constituting a wholesale rejection of the Minsk Agreements by the GoR. The United States, in coordination with partners and allies, imposed an embargo on the DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine as a result.

Today’s designations further hold to account those actors who were directly responsible for Russia’s illegitimate and unlawful recognition of the DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine and facilitating the sham pretext used by Putin to justify the Russian Federation’s unprovoked war against Ukraine. The eleven additional members of the Duma designated today consist of:

Yuriy Vyacheslavovich Afonin

Yevgeniy Ivanovich Bessonov

Leonid Ivanovich Kalashnikov

Vladimir Ivanovich Kashin

Nikolay Vasilievich Kolomeitsev

Aleksey Vladimirovich Kurinniy

Ivan Ivanovich Melnikov

Dmitriy Georgievich Novikov

Nikolay Ivanovich Osadchiy

Kazbek Kutsukovich Taysaev

Gennady Andreyevich Zyuganov

Volodin and the eleven additional Duma members were designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being or having been leaders, officials, senior executive officers, or members of the board of directors of the GoR. Each of these individuals were previously designated by the European Union and Canada. Volodin, Kalashnikov, and Melnikov were also previously designated by the United Kingdom.

SANCTIONS IMPLICATIONS

As a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property of the individuals above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. All transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or blocked persons are prohibited unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt. These prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any blocked person and the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.

SUPPORTING THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE

Today, OFAC issued Ukraine-related General License (GL) 23, pursuant to E.O. 14065, to authorize certain transactions that are ordinarily incident and necessary to nongovernmental organizations’ activities in the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) or Luhansk People’s Republic (LNR) regions of Ukraine, including activities related to humanitarian projects to meet basic human needs, democracy building, education, non-commercial developments projects, and environmental and natural resource protection.

OFAC’s issuance of GL 23 is the latest in a series of Ukraine-related general licenses that authorize U.S. persons to support certain humanitarian efforts and other activity in the DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine, including transactions related to the export of agricultural commodities or medicine, the response to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the official business of international organizations and entities, as well as personal remittances, telecommunications, internet services, and mail.

FUTHER GUIDANCE TO THWART SANCTIONS EVASION

Today, OFAC also issued new public guidance to further cut off avenues for potential sanctions evasion by Russia, in support of the G7 leaders’ commitment to maintain the effectiveness of economic measures. This guidance continues to make clear that Treasury’s expansive sanctions actions against Russia require all U.S. persons to comply with OFAC regulations, regardless of whether a transaction is denominated in traditional fiat currency or virtual currency. Sanctioned Russian persons are known to employ a wide variety of measures in their efforts to evade U.S. and international sanctions. As such, U.S. persons, wherever located, including firms that process virtual currency transactions, must be vigilant against attempts to circumvent OFAC regulations and must take risk-based steps to ensure they do not engage in prohibited transactions. OFAC is closely monitoring any efforts to circumvent or violate Russia-related sanctions, including through the use of virtual currency, and is committed to using its broad enforcement authorities to act against violations and to promote compliance.

This guidance follows a recent alert from Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), advising all financial institutions to be vigilant against potential efforts to evade the sanctions and restrictions on Russia. The alert provides examples of red flags to assist in identifying suspected sanctions evasion activity and reminds financial institutions of their reporting obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act.

IMPLEMENTING THE EXPANSIVE NEW EXECUTIVE ORDER

Today President Biden issued the E.O. of March 11, 2022 to ban further imports and exports related to Russia, consistent with commitments made by the G7 leaders to deny Russia export revenues and to ensure that our citizens are not underwriting Putin’s war.

Among other things, this E.O. prohibits the importation into the United States of the following products of Russian Federation origin: fish, seafood, and preparations thereof; alcoholic beverages; and non-industrial diamonds. In addition, this E.O. bans the exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply, directly or indirectly, from the United States, or by a U.S. person, wherever located, of U.S. dollar-denominated banknotes to the GoR or to any person located in the Russian Federation.

Pursuant to the Russian Harmful Foreign Activities Sanctions Regulations, which implement the E.O. of March 11, 2022, OFAC issued Russia-related GL 17 to authorize the import of existing purchases of prohibited products that are under pre-existing contract. OFAC also issued Russia-related GLs 18 and 19 to authorize certain activities regarding U.S. dollar-denominated banknotes as they pertain to personal remittances and U.S. persons, respectively.

Yes. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has imposed expansive sanctions actions against certain Russian entities and individuals pursuant to E.O. 14024, in addition to other authorities. All U.S. persons are required to comply with OFAC regulations, regardless of whether a transaction is denominated in traditional fiat currency or virtual currency (see FAQ 560).

Sanctioned Russian persons are known to employ a wide variety of measures in their efforts to evade U.S. and international sanctions. As such, U.S. persons, wherever located, including firms that process virtual currency transactions, must be vigilant against attempts to circumvent OFAC regulations and must take risk-based steps to ensure they do not engage in prohibited transactions. For additional information regarding sanctions compliance best practices for the virtual currency industry, please see OFAC’s Sanctions Compliance Guidance for the Virtual Currency Industry.

U.S. persons, including virtual currency exchanges, virtual wallet hosts, and other service providers, such as those that provide nested services for foreign exchanges, are generally prohibited from engaging in or facilitating prohibited transactions, including virtual currency transactions in which blocked persons have an interest. U.S. persons are further prohibited from engaging in or facilitating any transaction by a non-U.S. person that would be prohibited if performed by a U.S. person or within the United States, including virtual currency transactions involving the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, National Wealth Fund of the Russian Federation, or the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation. Among other activities, U.S. financial institutions are also generally prohibited from processing transactions, including virtual currency transactions, involving foreign financial institutions that are determined to be subject to the prohibitions of Directive 2 under Executive Order 14024, “Prohibitions Related to Correspondent or Payable-Through Accounts and Processing of Transactions Involving Certain Foreign Financial Institutions” (Russia-related CAPTA Directive). For additional information regarding the Russia-related CAPTA Directive, please see FAQ 967.

Non-U.S. persons are also subject to certain OFAC prohibitions. Such persons, for example, are prohibited from causing or conspiring to cause U.S. persons to violate U.S. sanctions, as well as engaging in conduct that evades or avoids a violation of OFAC sanctions. Violations of OFAC regulations may result in criminal or civil penalties.

E.O. 14024 further authorizes sanctions against persons determined to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have directly or indirectly engaged or attempted to engage in, deceptive or structured transactions or dealings to circumvent U.S. sanctions, including through the use of digital currencies or assets, or the use of physical assets. E.O. 14024 also authorizes sanctions against persons determined to operate or to have operated in the financial services or technology sectors of the Russian Federation economy, as well as persons that have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, blocked persons.

OFAC is closely monitoring any efforts to circumvent or violate Russia-related sanctions, including through the use of virtual currency, and is committed to using its broad enforcement authorities to act against violations and to promote compliance.

For additional information regarding the application of sanctions to virtual currency, please see FAQs 559, 560, 561, 562, 563, 594, 646, 647, and 971, as well as OFAC’s Sanctions Compliance Guidance for the Virtual Currency Industry.

3,121e05d9-4461-4895-8efa-09e3350278a5,[],,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) today sanctioned two individuals and three entities for supporting the DPRK’s ongoing development of its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missile programs in violation of multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions (UNSCRs). The DPRK has conducted 11 ballistic missile launches since the beginning of the year, most recently on March 4, 2022 (EST). Today’s action targets a group of foreign individuals and companies that aid a DPRK defense industry-related procurement agent in Russia; much of this activity also violates UN prohibitions with respect to the DPRK.

“The DPRK continues to launch ballistic missiles in blatant violation of international law, posing a grave threat to global security,” said Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian E. Nelson. “Today’s actions respond to this threat by targeting a network of Russia-based individuals and entities complicit in helping the DPRK procure components for its unlawful ballistic missile systems. The United States will continue to implement and enforce existing sanctions to press the DPRK to return to a diplomatic path and abandon its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and missiles.”

PROCUREMENT ACTIVITIES IN RUSSIA

On January 24, 2018, OFAC designated 10 representatives of the U.S.- and United Nations-designated Korea Ryonbong General Corporation (Ryonbong), including its representative Pak Kwang Hun based in Vladivostok, Russia. Ryonbong specializes in acquisition for DPRK defense industries and support for Pyongyang’s military-related sales. Its procurements also likely support the DPRK’s chemical weapons program.

Since his designation, Pak Kwang Hun has continued to operate in Russia as a DPRK procurement official in Vladivostok. During that time, the Russian company Apollon OOO (Apollon) and its director, Aleksandr Andreyevich Gayevoy (Gayevoy), aided Pak Kwang Hun in his procurement efforts. Specifically, Pak Kwang Hun acted under an alias and posed as an Apollon employee likely in order to deceive its suppliers of the true end-user of items he procured through the company. OFAC designated Apollon pursuant to E.O. 13687 for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, Pak Kwang Hun.

Gayevoy, in his role as the director and major shareholder of Apollon, not only authorized Pak Kwang Hun to act on behalf of the company, but also played an active part in the DPRK’s procurement efforts. OFAC designated Gayevoy pursuant to E.O. 13687 for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Apollon.

Pak Kwang Hun also worked through the Russian company Zeel – M Co., Ltd (Zeel – M) with the help of its director, Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Chasovnikov (Chasovnikov), in his procurement efforts. In addition to supporting Pak Kwang Hun, Chasovnikov coordinated the purchase and transportation of a variety of items for other DPRK government organizations. At times, Zeel – M paid Russian port service fees for DPRK vessels, and Chasovnikov himself was involved in the coordination of a ship-to-ship transfer involving a DPRK vessel.

OFAC designated Chasovnikov pursuant to E.O. 13687 for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, the Government of North Korea. Additionally, OFAC designated both Zeel – M and another Russian company, RK Briz, OOO, pursuant to E.O. 13687 for being owned or controlled by Chasovnikov.

SANCTIONS IMPLICATIONS

As a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property of the individuals and entities that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons must be blocked and reported to OFAC. OFAC’s regulations generally prohibit all dealings by U.S. persons or within the United States (including transactions transiting the United States) that involve any property or interests in property of blocked or designated persons.

In addition, persons that engage in certain transactions with the individuals or entities designated today may themselves be exposed to designation. Furthermore, any foreign financial institution that knowingly facilitates a significant transaction or provides significant financial services for any of the individuals or entities designated today could be subject to U.S. correspondent or payable-through account sanctions.

The power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from its ability to designate and add persons to the SDN List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. For information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer to OFAC’s Frequently Asked Question 897. For detailed information on the process to submit a request for removal from an OFAC sanctions list.

Overview of United States sanctions on Russian persons (individuals, entities, and vessels).

U.S. businesses should be aware that the United States imposes sanctions on Russian persons (individuals, entities, and vessels) in response to conduct including Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea, invasion of eastern Ukraine, election interference, malicious cyber activities, human rights abuses, uses of chemical weapons, weapons proliferation, illicit trade with North Korea, and support to Syria and Venezuela. Further sanctions on Russian persons, entities, and ships involved in the Nord Stream 2 projects have been imposed, and additional measures are also under consideration, although the U.S. Government waived sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG, the company behind Russia’s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany, and its chief executive, in May 2021. While U.S. companies and individuals can lawfully engage in a broad range of business activities involving Russia that are not subject to sanction, penalties for violating U.S. sanctions can be severe. Therefore, American companies are advised to familiarize themselves with potentially applicable sanctions and to conduct thorough due diligence to ascertain whether a particular type of business activity or customers, clients, suppliers, or partners may be subject to sanctions.

The Consolidated Screening List can be a helpful tool for due diligence efforts. The Screening List is a web-based platform that consolidates eleven separate export screening lists of the Departments of Commerce, State, and the Treasury into a single list of parties for which the USG maintains sanctions and restrictions on certain exports, reexports, and transfers of items. Companies can search the list by entity name, country, and other criteria to help ascertain whether potential transaction parties might be subject to export restrictions or other sanctions. The U.S. Department of the Treasury maintains a Resource Center with comprehensive information regarding Russia-related sanctions, particularly those pertaining to Ukraine. Additional information resources can be found in the “Export Controls” section of this Country Commercial Guide.

Summary: Sanctions against Russian persons may include blocking of assets subject to U.S. jurisdiction; limits on access to the U.S. financial system, including limiting or prohibiting transactions involving U.S. individuals and businesses; and denial of entry into the United States. The United States also tightly controls exports to Russia’s energy and defense sectors. Following is a summary of current U.S. sanctions applied to Russia. A more complete overview of sanctions, periodically updated, is available from the Congressional Research Service.

Most of the current U.S. sanctions are in response to Russia’s 2014 invasion and annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region and Russia’s fostering of conflict in eastern Ukraine. The basis for Ukraine-related sanctions is a series of Executive Orders (EOs 13660, 13661, 13662, and 13685) that were issued in 2014 and codified by the Countering Russian Influence in Europe and Eurasia Act of 2017 (CRIEEA; P.L. 115-44, Title II; 22 U.S.C. 9501 et seq.), a part of the broader “Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act” (CAATSA). These Executive Orders provide for sanctions against those that the President determines have undermined Ukraine’s security and stability, misappropriated Ukrainian state assets, or conducted business, trade, or investment in occupied Crimea. They also provide for sanctions against any Russian government officials and those who offer them support, persons who operate in the Russian arms sector, and persons who operate in key sectors of the Russian economy.

Sectoral sanctions apply to specific entities in Russia’s financial, energy and defense sectors. U.S. persons are restricted from engaging in specific transactions with these entities. Restrictions apply to new equity investment and financing for entities in Russia’s financial sector; and new financing for identified entities in Russia’s energy and defense sectors. Sectoral sanctions also prohibit U.S. trade-related to the development of Russian deep-water, Arctic offshore, or shale projects that have the potential to produce oil and, as amended by CRIEEA, such projects worldwide in which those entities have an ownership interest of at least 33% or a majority of voting interests.

The United States revised CAATSA Section 232 guidance in July 2020, opening up the possibility of sanctions on entities facilitating the completion of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Several Russian entities and ships involved with the construction and pipelaying of Nord Stream 2 have been sanctioned, and the U.S. Congress continues to consider several proposals related to Nord Stream 2 with potential sanctions implications for Russian entities and their partners on the Nord Stream 2 and Turkstream projects.

In addition to Ukraine-related sanctions, the United States maintains certain sanctions in response to malicious cyber activities, under EO 13694, as amended by EO 13757 (and codified by CRIEEA). These measures target Russian individuals and entities that have engaged in cyberattacks against critical infrastructure, for financial or commercial gain, to significantly disrupt the availability of computers or networks, or to interfere with U.S. election processes and institutions. CRIEEA, at Section 224, enlarged the scope of cyber-related activities subject to sanctions to include a range of activities conducted on behalf of the Russian government that undermine “cybersecurity against any person, including a democratic institution, or government.”

The Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-208, Title IV; 22 U.S.C. 5811 note) requires the President to impose sanctions on persons he identifies (U.S. Sanctions on Russia: An Overview www.crs.gov | 7-5700) as having been involved in either a “criminal conspiracy” uncovered by Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky or his subsequent imprisonment and death. The act also requires the President to impose sanctions on those he finds have committed human rights abuses against individuals who are fighting to expose the illegal activity of Russian government officials or seeking internationally recognized human rights and freedoms.

The Support for the Sovereignty, Integrity, Democracy, and Economic Stability of Ukraine Act of 2014, as amended (SSIDES; P.L. 113-95; 22 U.S.C. 8901 et seq.), requires sanctions on those responsible for serious human rights abuses in “any territory forcibly occupied or otherwise controlled” by the Russian government. In November 2018, the Administration designated three persons for human rights abuses in Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine.

Use of a Chemical Weapon: In August 2018, the United States determined that Russia used a chemical weapon in violation of international law in the March 2018 nerve agent attack on a British citizen and his daughter. This finding triggered the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991 (CBW Act, P.L. 102-182, Title III; 22 U.S.C. 5601 et seq.). The CBW Act requires the President to terminate most foreign aid, arms sales, export licenses for controlled goods and services, and government-backed financial assistance. The second round of CBW sanctions, announced in August 2019, entails prohibition on U.S. banks’ participation in the primary market for non-ruble denominated bonds issued by Russia and lending to the Russian government/sovereign; U.S. opposition to the extension of any loan or financial or technical assistance to Russia by international financial institutions; and tightening of restrictions on the export of certain products subject to restrictions administered by the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security.

The United States also determined that Russia used a chemical weapon in an August 2020 attack on Alexei Navalny, again triggering the CBW Act and requiring the President to terminate most foreign aid, arms sales, export licenses for controlled goods and services, and government-backed financial assistance. The second round of CBW sanctions in response to the Navalny poisoning was announced in August 2021, as required by the law.

Weapons Proliferation: Several Russian defense-industry entities, including state-owned arms exporter Rosoboronexport, are denied most U.S. government contracts, export licenses, and trade in U.S. Munitions List-controlled items according to the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act, as amended (INKSNA, P.L. 106-178; 50 U.S.C. 1701 note). Other Russian entities are subject to sanctions under other legal authorities for providing certain goods or facilitating trade with North Korea or for their support to the Syrian government.",https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/russia-sanctions
5,121e05d9-4461-4895-8efa-09e3350278a5,[],2022-03-11 00:00:00,"Today, President Biden and G7 Leaders from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom as well as the European Union will announce new economic actions to hold Putin accountable for his continued assault on Ukraine and further isolate Russia from the global financial system. Each partner will implement actions consistent with their national processes.

These actions will collectively ramp up pressure on Putin and build on the unprecedented package of economic sanctions and export controls the United States and over 30 countries have already imposed on Russia. Today, the ruble is trading at its weakest level ever and is worth less than a penny; the Russian stock market is closed for the longest time in history; the Russian government’s credit rating has been downgraded to “junk” status, and we’re seeing a mass exodus from Russia by the private sector – the result of our historic, multilateral coordination and commitment to ensure that Putin’s war of choice is a strategic failure. Russia has now become a global economic and financial pariah.

Today’s announcements include:

Revoking Russia’s Most-Favored Nation Status. President Biden will work closely with Congress to deny Russia the benefits of its WTO membership and ensure that Russian imports do not receive most favored nation treatment in our economy. The United States Congress has demonstrated bipartisan leadership to revoke Permanent Normal Trade Relations for Russia, and President Biden looks forward to signing a bill into law. Together with similar actions by the G7, following our respective national processes, this collective action by more than half of the global economy will deliver another serious economic blow to Russia.

Denying Borrowing Privileges at Multilateral Financial Institutions. The G7 Leaders will agree to ensure Russia cannot obtain financing from the leading multilateral financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Russia cannot grossly violate international law and expect to benefit from being part of the international economic order.

Full blocking Sanctions on Additional Russian Elites and their Family Members. This includes Yuri Kovalchuk, executives of banks we have sanctioned, and Duma members who sponsored legislation to recognize the so-called “Donetsk People’s Republic” and “Luhansk People’s Republic.” This action will follow up on multiple efforts, along with those of our allies and partners, to target Russian elites and their family members who are profiting from this war of choice, and cuts them off from the U.S. financial system, freezes any assets they hold in the United States and blocks their travel to the United States. We will work through the international task force announced on February 26 to pursue the ill-gotten gains of these elites.



Ban Export of Luxury Goods to Russia. President Biden will sign an Executive Order (E.O) that will end the exportation of luxury items to any person located in the Russian Federation. This will ensure that U.S. persons are not providing luxury items, such as high end-watches, luxury vehicles, high-end apparel, high-end alcohol, jewelry, and other goods frequently purchased by Russian elites. The U.S. export value of the products covered by today’s luxury goods restrictions is nearly $550 million per year. The elites who sustain Putin’s war machine should no longer be able to reap the gains of this system and squander the resources of the Russian people.

Ban U.S. Import of Goods from Several Signature Sectors of Russia’s Economy. President Biden’s E.O. will also prohibit the import of goods from several signature sectors of Russia’s economy – including seafood, spirits/vodka, and non-industrial diamonds. This will deny Russia more than $1 billion in export revenues and ensure U.S. citizens are not underwriting Putin’s war. The United States retains the authority to impose additional import bans as appropriate.

New guidance by the Department of Treasury to Thwart Sanctions Evasion, including through Virtual Currency. The Department of the Treasury, through new guidance, will continue to make clear that Treasury’s expansive actions against Russia require all U.S. persons to comply with sanctions regulations regardless of whether a transaction is denominated in traditional fiat currency or virtual currency. Treasury is closely monitoring any efforts to circumvent or violate Russia-related sanctions, including through the use of virtual currency, and is committed to using its broad enforcement authorities to act against violations and to promote compliance.

Create the Authority to Ban New Investment in Any Sector of the Russian Federation Economy. President Biden has already banned new U.S. investments in the Russian energy sector. This E.O. will establish the legal authority for future investment restrictions in any sector of the Russian economy, as may be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, by a United States person.

WASHINGTON – Today, in its latest action to impose severe costs on the Russian Federation for its illegal, unwarranted, and baseless war against Ukraine, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is designating key enablers of the invasion. This includes dozens of Russian defense companies, 328 members of the Russian State Duma, and the head of Russia’s largest financial institution. This action aligns with similar actions taken by the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Canada, and reflects continued unity to hold Putin accountable for his war of choice.

OFAC is designating multiple companies that are part of Russia’s defense-industrial base and that produce weapons that have been used in Russia’s assault against Ukraine’s people, infrastructure, and territory. Today’s designations build on those levied by Treasury in previous weeks against key components of the Government of the Russian Federation (GoR) that facilitate Putin’s hostile campaign against Ukraine. By cutting off 48 companies from western technological and financial resources, today’s action will have a deep and long-lasting effect on Russia’s defense-industrial base and its supply chain.

Russian Duma members supported the Kremlin’s efforts to violate Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, including through treaties recognizing the self-proclaimed independence of areas of eastern Ukraine controlled by Russia’s proxies, known as the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) and Luhansk People’s Republic (LNR). Today’s action follows OFAC’s March 11, 2022 designation of 12 members of the Russian State Duma who appealed to President Vladimir Putin to recognize the independence of the DNR and LNR. In addition to designating 328 members of the State Duma today, OFAC is also designating the State Duma itself as an entity. Today’s actions are being taken pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 14024, which authorizes sanctions against Russia for its harmful foreign activities, including violating core principles of international law, such as respect for the territorial integrity of other states. OFAC’s actions complement the ongoing efforts of our allies and partners to hold accountable all those responsible for furthering this unconscionable war of choice against Ukraine and its people.

Finally, OFAC is designating Herman Gref, the head of Sberbank and a close Putin associate.

“The United States, with our partners and allies, is striking at the heart of Russia’s ability to finance and carry out its warfare and atrocities against Ukraine,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “The Russian State Duma continues to support Putin’s invasion, stifle the free flow of information, and infringe on the basic rights of the citizens of Russia. We call on those closest to Putin to cease and condemn this cold-blooded war.”

Treasury has also issued new guidance on transactions with the Central Bank of the Russian Federation involving gold.

Tactical Missiles Corporation JSC — often abbreviated and transliterated as KTRV — is a large, state-owned Russian defense conglomerate. KTRV produces materiel in support of Russia’s defense-industrial base, including airborne weapons and weapon systems for Russia’s navy. Among these products are various underwater weapons, as well as digital computers and radar systems used in submarine fleets. KTRV also produces hypersonic weapons and supplies anti-radar, anti-ship, and other multi-purpose missiles.

Russia is deploying KRTV products in its war against Ukraine.

It was designated previously by the United Kingdom.

In addition to the main holding company, KTRV, OFAC designated 28 entities that are part of KTRV’s structure. These entities design and manufacture diverse products in support of Russia’s defense-industrial base, such as ammunition, radar systems, missile systems, and other military equipment. All entities owned 50 percent or more, directly or indirectly, by KTRV are subject to blocking, even if not identified by OFAC.

OFAC also is designating the General Director of KTRV, Boris Viktorovich Obnosov (Obnosov), pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being or having been a leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the board of directors of KTRV, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked under E.O. 14024.

The Duma, which is the Russian Parliament’s lower chamber, passed a resolution asking Putin to recognize DNR and LNR as independent states, though they are part of Ukraine. Putin recognized the so-called independence of the self-proclaimed DNR and LNR as a ruse to justify ordering Russia’s troops into Ukraine, thereby initiating Putin’s war of choice against his neighbor. The Duma is being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being a political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality of the GoR.

In addition, OFAC is designating 328 members of the Duma pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being or having been leaders, officials, senior executive officers, or members of the board of directors of the GoR.

KEY RUSSIAN FINANCIAL SECTOR OFFICIAL AND CLOSE PUTIN CONFIDANT

Herman Oskarovich Gref (Gref) is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Public Joint Stock Company Sberbank of Russia (Sberbank) and Chairman of its Executive Board. On February 24, 2022, Treasury imposed correspondent and payable-through account restrictions on Sberbank, Russia’s largest financial institution. As CEO of Sberbank, Gref oversees not just Russia’s largest multi-billion dollar, multinational financial institution, but also a large number of companies owned by Sberbank in other industries.

Gref has been an advisor to Putin since the 1990s, during which time he occupied various and increasingly senior roles, including at the St. Petersburg Mayor’s office. Additionally, Gref served as Russia’s Minister of Economic Development and Trade from 2000 to 2007, a position to which he was appointed by Putin before becoming CEO of Sberbank. Gref is being designated today for being or having been a leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the board of directors of the GoR.

NEW GUIDANCE ON GOLD TRANSACTIONS

Treasury is also issuing a new Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) to blunt the Central Bank’s ability to deploy international reserves, including gold, to prop up the Russian economy and fund Putin’s brutal war. This guidance makes clear that any transaction involving gold related to the Central Bank of the Russian Federation is covered by existing sanctions.

SANCTIONS IMPLICATIONS

As a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property of the persons above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked.

WASHINGTON, March 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued new guidance on Friday clarifying that U.S. citizens and digital asset firms are required to comply with sanctions against Russia, even when facilitating transactions in cryptocurrency.

OFAC said in the guidance that people in the United States as well as businesses that deal in cryptocurrency, ""must be vigilant against attempts to circumvent OFAC regulations"" and should ""take risk-based steps to ensure they do not engage in prohibited transactions.""

The warning comes as many in the crypto industry are responding to concerns from some lawmakers that digital assets could be used to circumvent Western sanctions imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. read more

Biden administration officials have said that they do not believe Russia would be able to use cryptocurrency to completely evade sanctions, but are still warning companies to be on the lookout.

In guidance issued on Monday, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) said crypto exchanges must report any suspicious activity, but Friday's notice goes further by stating plainly that exchanges are prohibited from engaging in or facilitating illegal transactions.

The major crypto exchanges, including Coinbase and Binance, have not heeded calls to block Russian users, as some Ukrainian officials have called for.

Alex Bornyakov, Ukraine's deputy minister of digital transformation, told Reuters that crypto exchanges that choose to remain in Russia will face public backlash unless they reverse course. read more

8,121e05d9-4461-4895-8efa-09e3350278a5,[],2022-03-11 00:00:00,"Today, President Biden and G7 Leaders from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom as well as the European Union will announce new economic actions to hold Putin accountable for his continued assault on Ukraine and further isolate Russia from the global financial system. Each partner will implement actions consistent with their national processes.

These actions will collectively ramp up pressure on Putin and build on the unprecedented package of economic sanctions and export controls the United States and over 30 countries have already imposed on Russia. Today, the ruble is trading at its weakest level ever and is worth less than a penny; the Russian stock market is closed for the longest time in history; the Russian government’s credit rating has been downgraded to “junk” status, and we’re seeing a mass exodus from Russia by the private sector – the result of our historic, multilateral coordination and commitment to ensure that Putin’s war of choice is a strategic failure. Russia has now become a global economic and financial pariah.

Today’s announcements include:

Revoking Russia’s Most-Favored Nation Status. President Biden will work closely with Congress to deny Russia the benefits of its WTO membership and ensure that Russian imports do not receive most favored nation treatment in our economy. The United States Congress has demonstrated bipartisan leadership to revoke Permanent Normal Trade Relations for Russia, and President Biden looks forward to signing a bill into law. Together with similar actions by the G7, following our respective national processes, this collective action by more than half of the global economy will deliver another serious economic blow to Russia.

Denying Borrowing Privileges at Multilateral Financial Institutions. The G7 Leaders will agree to ensure Russia cannot obtain financing from the leading multilateral financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Russia cannot grossly violate international law and expect to benefit from being part of the international economic order.

Full blocking Sanctions on Additional Russian Elites and their Family Members. This includes Yuri Kovalchuk, executives of banks we have sanctioned, and Duma members who sponsored legislation to recognize the so-called “Donetsk People’s Republic” and “Luhansk People’s Republic.” This action will follow up on multiple efforts, along with those of our allies and partners, to target Russian elites and their family members who are profiting from this war of choice, and cuts them off from the U.S. financial system, freezes any assets they hold in the United States and blocks their travel to the United States. We will work through the international task force announced on February 26 to pursue the ill-gotten gains of these elites.



Ban Export of Luxury Goods to Russia. President Biden will sign an Executive Order (E.O) that will end the exportation of luxury items to any person located in the Russian Federation. This will ensure that U.S. persons are not providing luxury items, such as high end-watches, luxury vehicles, high-end apparel, high-end alcohol, jewelry, and other goods frequently purchased by Russian elites. The U.S. export value of the products covered by today’s luxury goods restrictions is nearly $550 million per year. The elites who sustain Putin’s war machine should no longer be able to reap the gains of this system and squander the resources of the Russian people.

Ban U.S. Import of Goods from Several Signature Sectors of Russia’s Economy. President Biden’s E.O. will also prohibit the import of goods from several signature sectors of Russia’s economy – including seafood, spirits/vodka, and non-industrial diamonds. This will deny Russia more than $1 billion in export revenues and ensure U.S. citizens are not underwriting Putin’s war. The United States retains the authority to impose additional import bans as appropriate.

New guidance by the Department of Treasury to Thwart Sanctions Evasion, including through Virtual Currency. The Department of the Treasury, through new guidance, will continue to make clear that Treasury’s expansive actions against Russia require all U.S. persons to comply with sanctions regulations regardless of whether a transaction is denominated in traditional fiat currency or virtual currency. Treasury is closely monitoring any efforts to circumvent or violate Russia-related sanctions, including through the use of virtual currency, and is committed to using its broad enforcement authorities to act against violations and to promote compliance.

Create the Authority to Ban New Investment in Any Sector of the Russian Federation Economy. President Biden has already banned new U.S. investments in the Russian energy sector. This E.O. will establish the legal authority for future investment restrictions in any sector of the Russian economy, as may be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, by a United States person.

The sanctions against more than two dozen individuals amount to an asset freeze and will mean that their U.S. property can’t interact with the rest of the economy. All sanctioned assets will also have to be reported to the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC).

“Treasury continues to hold Russian officials to account for enabling Putin’s unjustified and unprovoked war,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. “Today’s actions also further isolate the severely damaged Russian economy by prohibiting trade in products that are key to the economic and financial interests of all Russian elites.”

Newly sanctioned properties include an Aruba-registered jet and a Cook Islands-registered yacht, both worth around $90 million, belonging to Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselsberg, whose holdings total around $6 billion. Vekselberg’s financial interests, according to the Treasury, span multiple sectors of the Russian economy, and involve some of the most significant tech investments in Russia.

The board of Russia’s second largest bank, VTB Bank, were also individually sanctioned on Friday for doing business in the financial services sector of the Russian economy. VTB bank itself was sanctioned back in February.

Assets belonging to the family of Dmitriy Peskov, press secretary of Russian president Vladimir Putin, have also been cordoned off from the U.S. economy.

Peskov’s wife “has a property empire worth more than $10 million,” Treasury said. “Her real estate includes property in an elite Moscow suburb where Putin also lives, another multimillion-dollar apartment in Moscow given to her by the [Government of Russia], and an apartment in Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula.”

Twelve members of the Russian legislature, or Duma, were likewise added to OFAC’s sanctions list for lobbying for the Russian recognition of separatist republics in the east of Ukraine, a move described by the Treasury as a pretext for the Russian invasion.

Friday’s sanctions are the latest in a series of economic measures against Russia that include an oil ban, a possible downgrading of trade relations, and a tax penalty initiative announced Friday by Senate Finance Committee chairman Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).",https://thehill.com/policy/finance/597925-treasury-slaps-new-sanctions-on-russian-elites/
