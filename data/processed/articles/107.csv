Lawmakers of both parties have said they are wary of a no-fly zone at this time because they think it could pit the US directly against Russia in the skies over Ukraine.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki, meanwhile, told reporters on Tuesday that, despite requests from Zelensky, the White House does not support instituting a no-fly zone over Ukraine or supplying the Ukrainian Air Force with new fighter aircraft.

What is a no-fly zone? A no-fly zone is an area where certain aircraft cannot fly for any number of reasons. In the context of a conflict such as the one in Ukraine, it would probably mean a zone in which Russian planes were not allowed to fly, to prevent them from carrying out airstrikes against Ukraine.

NATO has imposed no-fly zones in non-member countries before, including Bosnia and Libya. However, it is always a controversial move because it means getting semi-involved in a conflict without fully committing ground forces.

What would happen if NATO imposed a no-fly zone? The problem with military no-fly zones is that they have to be enforced by military power. If a Russian aircraft flew into a NATO no-fly zone, then NATO forces would have to take action against that aircraft. Those measures could include shooting the plane from the sky. That would, in Russia's eyes, be an act of war by NATO and would likely escalate the conflict.

Why hasn't NATO imposed a no-fly zone? Neither Ukraine nor Russia is a member of NATO. Russia President Vladimir Putin clearly sees NATO as a direct threat to his authority and has recently criticized its expansion toward Russia, using it as justification for his invasion of Ukraine.

As a result, NATO is extremely reluctant to become directly involved in the Ukraine conflict with a rival nuclear power. While it supports Ukraine's resistance and recognizes Putin's actions as an invasion of a sovereign nation, the alliance is simply not prepared to do anything that could be interpreted as a direct act of war on Russia and risk an escalation that could lead to the use of nuclear weapons.

Ukraine’s leader President Zelensky has asked the West for a no-fly zone to be implemented as a preventative measure as his country comes under aerial attack from Russia.

He said it is not intended to drag NATO into a war with Russia, but his pleas so far have been rejected.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said RAF jets could be forced to attack Russian planes if there was a no-fly zone, which would result in a much wider conflict.

Here we explain what a no-fly zone (NFZ) is, why NATO is refusing to impose one and how they have been used in the past.

What is a no-fly zone?

A no-fly-zone is an area where aircraft are barred or restricted from flying, normally for security reasons.

They are often used in war zones to stop an aggressor flying military aircraft over its own land.

It prevents attacks on civilians or military targets, as well as carrying out surveillance.

Opposing fighter jets patrol the zone in search of any aircraft breaking the rules.

Any rogue planes could be forced to land or escorted away - and they could ultimately risk being shot down.

No-fly zones can also be used over major events like the Olympics or over certain buildings.

One was imposed around the royal residence of Windsor Castle this year to permanently limit how close aircraft can get.

A no-fly zone over Ukraine would mean that NATO forces would engage directly with any Russian planes spotted in those skies and shoot at them if necessary.

Why is NATO refusing to impose one over Ukraine?

NATO countries including the UK and America have refused to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine, to prevent a direct war from breaking out.

NATO’s secretary general Jens Stoltenberg has repeatedly ruled out a no-fly zone over Ukraine, telling NBC on 28 February: “We have no intention of moving into Ukraine, either on the ground or in the air.”

On Saturday 5 March, Mr Stoltenberg reiterated this message, arguing that such a move could result in a “full-fledged war in Europe involving many more countries”.

“We are not part of this conflict,” he added.

“We have a responsibility as NATO allies to prevent this war from escalating beyond Ukraine because that would be even more dangerous, more devastating and would cause even more human suffering.”

Fighter jets would be in direct conflict with Russian planes and could ultimately be forced to shoot one down.

This could start a direct war between NATO countries and Russia - and potentially spiral out of control.

A tearful Ukrainian journalist confronted Boris Johnson over why NATO is not implementing a no-fly zone on Tuesday 1 March at a news conference.

“Ukrainian women and Ukrainian children are in deep fear because of bombs and missiles which are coming from the sky,” Daria Kaleniuk said.

Mr Johnson aid UK jets would ultimately have to be ""engaged in shooting down Russian planes"".

""That is not something that we can do or that we’ve envisaged. I think the consequences of that will be truly very, very difficult to control,"" he said.

UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I won’t trigger a European war, but what I will do is help Ukraine fight every street with every piece of equipment we can get to them, and we will support them.”

America has also ruled out the idea.

The White House spokesperson said it could trigger ""a direct conflict, and potentially a war with Russia"".

What is the military view?

The Chief of the Defence Staff, Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, has said a no-fly zone over Ukraine “would not help”.

He told the BBC’s Sunday Morning programme: “The advice that we as senior military professionals are giving our politicians is to avoid doing things that are tactically ineffective and definitely to avoid doing things that tactically might lead to miscalculation or escalation.

“The no-fly zone would not help.

“Most of the shelling is coming from artillery, most of the destruction is coming from artillery, it’s not coming from Russian aircraft.

“If we were to police a no-fly zone, it means that we probably have to take out Russian defence systems and we would have Nato aircraft in the air alongside Russian aircraft, and then the potential of shooting them down and then that leads to an escalation.”

However, a former Nato supreme commander in Europe has broken with the military consensus to call for the West to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine.

General Philip Breedlove said the move could be carried out without “bellicose rules of engagement” that would spark a wider conflict with Russia.

General Breedlove asked: “How many casualties does it take before we take a different approach to this war?”

“I think there’s 42 million or so Ukrainians. Does it take 42 million to convince the West that we should have a different approach to this war? This is the questions that need to be going to leaders now.”

General Breedlove, a US air force general who served as Nato Supreme Allied Commander Europe between 2013 and 2016, argued a “humanitarian no-fly zone” would be possible.

It would be “one in which we go in with a decidedly non-bellicose set of rules of engagement,” he said in an interview with Times Radio.

“Those rules of engagement whereby we talk to our enemy, and we say we are not going to fire on you unless you fire on us,” he added.

How would a no-fly zone benefit Ukraine?

Russia’s air force is its principal military advantage over Ukraine, and so a no-fly zone could make a significant difference to prevent attacks.

Recent satellite pictures showed rows of attack helicopters ready to strike.

President Zelensky says it would be a preventative measure and not intended to drag NATO into a war with Russia.

However, Ukraine’s air forces are still operational with its fighter jets carrying out defensive missions.

A fleet of their Turkish-made drones equipped with laser-guided missiles has had apparent success in destroying Russian positions.

Where have no-fly zones been used before?

After the first Gulf War in 1991 the US, UK and France enforced two no-fly zones in Iraq to prevent Saddam Hussein from attacking the country’s Kurdish and Shia Muslim populations.

This was done without United Nations backing.

In the 1990s NATO countries also implemented a no-fly zone during the Bosnian War in Operation Deny Flight.

In 2011 Libya came under a no-fly zone to protect its people from attacks from the Gaddafi regime.

British RAF jets were among those involved.

The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

WATCH: ‘We need you right now,’ Ukraine’s Zelensky asks U.S. Congress for more help

Already, the United States has worked with other Western and Western-allied nations to impose what are jointly some of the toughest sanctions ever leveled against a country. That includes sanctions against Russia’s financial institutions and systems, bans on much of its international trade, and individual sanctions targeting many of the defense officials, civilian leaders and oligarchs in Russia’s power structure.

Here’s a look at Zelensky’s other asks of the United States on Wednesday.

A no-fly zone, or an alternative

As expected, Zelensky in his appeal to the world’s superpower Wednesday renewed a request he has made repeatedly throughout the 3-week-old invasion: Western creation of a no-fly zone to block the Russian warplanes now attacking Ukraine’s cities and other civilian targets.

“Is this too much to ask,” so that “Russia would not be able to terrorize our cities?” the Ukrainian leader asked U.S. lawmakers listening, rapt, by video.

The U.S. has joined NATO in flatly rejecting creating a no-fly zone over Ukraine, which is not a member of the NATO bloc and is not protected by its defense pact.

Setting up such a zone would likely entail Western air forces directly engaging with Russia’s military. That would greatly increase the chances of a broader war between Russia and NATO members, something Biden says he’s not willing to risk for Ukraine. So would providing Ukraine with MiG fighter jets and a U.S. or NATO base to fly them out of, something else that the U.S. and NATO have said no to.

Notably, however, Zelensky also presented another option to the no-fly zone.

“If this is too much to ask, we offer you an alternative,” Zelensky said, leveraging the tougher ask to push for an easier one. He then asked for the Soviet-era S-300 anti-aircraft missile systems, or “similar systems.”

That’s on top of Stingers, Javelins and other, less-advanced anti-aircraft weapons that the West already has provided Ukraine. Ukrainian fighters are using the Stingers, a simple shoulder-mounted missile that uses an infrared sensor to blow up low-flying aircraft, effectively against Russian aircraft, denying Russian forces control over Ukraine’s skies, U.S. military officials say.

The S-300s can be used to knock both enemy aircraft and cruise missiles out of the skies. They’re mounted on mobile units, allowing Ukrainian fighters to strike and then escape.

Three NATO members — Greece, Bulgaria and Slovakia — are reported to have them.

Without naming any system by name, Biden announced new U.S. military aid Wednesday, including helping Ukraine obtain long-range anti-aircraft systems — a description consistent with the S-300s — and providing advanced drones.

Especially given Russia’s history of relying on warplanes and missiles to level cities and crush resistance in offensives in Chechnya and Syria, U.S. officials have looked closely at providing Ukraine with better air defense systems.

Ukraine’s resistance to Russian forces, the horrifying toll on Ukraine’s people, and its charismatic president’s appeals, have Biden and lawmakers of both parties in Congress rushing to provide military and humanitarian support, within the limits Biden is setting in hopes of avoiding a broader war. The support includes a more than $13 billion legislative package Biden signed Tuesday.

More sanctions

Zelensky also appealed to the U.S. to intensify its already punishing package of financial sanctions against Russia, including hitting all the sitting members of Russia’s Duma and every other politician in office in Russia.

“In the darkest time for our country we call on you,” he said, speaking to lawmakers who rose to their feet repeatedly to applaud the Ukrainian leader. “New packages of sanctions are needed every week until the Russian military stops.”

The U.S., European nations and other world allies from the first days of Russia’s invasion enacted some of the toughest financial penalties in history. U.S. officials said the measures would cut Russia off from much of the world’s financial systems and trade, starve it of high tech and other imports, send the value of the Russian ruble plunging, and eventually plunge Russia into recession.

A steady stream of individual sanctions have also targeted powerful businesspeople and senior military and civilian officials in Russian President Vladimir Putin’s power structure, as well as their family members.

The status of any consideration of sweeping U.S. sanctions against Russian lawmakers wasn’t immediately known Wednesday. Notably, however, Biden pointed out in first announcing the start of sanctions over Putin’s invasion last month that the Russian leader was acting with the approval of Russia’s Duma.

‘Make sure the Russians do not receive a single penny’

Zelensky urged U.S. companies still doing business in Russia to leave. He asked lawmakers to pressure any holdout businesses in their districts to get out.

“American companies must leave Russia’s market because it is flooded with our blood,” he said.

“Make sure that the Russians do not receive a single penny that they use to destroy our people in Ukraine” and for the “destruction of our country and the destruction of Europe.”

According to a list kept by Yale’s School of Management, 147 U.S. corporations have announced since Russia launched its invasion that they are pulling out of that country entirely.

Another 173 U.S. companies have said they are suspending operations.

With support in the West strong for Ukraine, and threats of boycotts of companies still doing business there, another roughly 70 American companies have said they are scaling back operations or holding off on new investment, but remaining.

Steady public pressure has helped winnow the total of companies that have made no announced change to their operations in Russia to fewer than 40, according to a list maintained by Jeffrey Sonnenfeld of the Yale School of Management.",https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-did-ukraine-president-zelensky-ask-for-during-his-call-with-u-s-congress

Zelenskyy, who was greeted with at least three standing ovations from an audience of lawmakers, asked the U.S. to implement a no-fly zone over Ukraine to stem the Russian attacks, which have led to the deaths of thousands of people. ""This is a terror that Europe has not seen, has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for a reply, for an answer to this terror from the whole world,"" said Zelenskyy, who during his speech played a video showing the bombing of Ukraine and wounded and dead civilians. ""Is this a lot to ask for, to create a no-fly zone over Ukraine to save people? Is this too much to ask?"" he said via video link from the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.

Zelenskyy acknowledged that Western leaders have resisted the idea of a no-fly zone, which would require NATO to take over the air and shoot down enemies to protect civilians on the ground. It's been repeatedly rejected out of fears of triggering another world war. ""If this is too much to ask, we offer an alternative,"" he said. That included additional weapons and humanitarian support beyond what has already been granted to Ukraine, as well as even tougher sanctions on Russia and leading Russian supporters of that country's president, Vladimir Putin, he said.

""Constantly, every week, until the Russian military machine stops, restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based,"" Zelenskyy said, referring to additional sanctions. He also urged members of Congress to get companies in their legislative districts to leave the Russian market, ""because it is flooded with our blood."" ""I call on you to do more,"" he said. Referring to President Joe Biden by name, Zelenskyy said he wanted his American counterpart to lead the world, not just the U.S., in the face of Russian aggression. ""Being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace,"" Zelenskyy said. Biden is expected to announce hundreds of millions of dollars in additional aid to Ukraine later Wednesday. Zelenskyy was introduced for his address by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. ""Glory to heroes,"" Pelosi said in Ukrainian before he began speaking. Zelenskyy began by saying, ""I'm proud to greet you from Ukraine from our capital city ... that is under missile and airstrikes from Russian troops every day, but it doesn't give up."" ""And we have not even thought about it for a second. Just like many other cities, and communities in our beautiful country, which found themselves in the worst war since World War II,"" he said. Zelenskyy soon returned to that linkage with World War II after noting what he called America's foundational tenets of ""democracy, independence, freedom and care for everyone."" ""We in Ukraine want the same for our people,"" he said. ""All that is normal part of your own life.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/16/ukraine-president-zelenskyy-makes-speech-to-congress-on-russia-war.html
