LVIV, Ukraine March 18 (Reuters) - The governor of Ukraine's eastern Luhansk region said frequent and widespread shelling by Russian forces was preventing the safe evacuation of civilians from towns and villages on the front line.

Russia has denied targeting civilians since the start of its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, which it calls a ""special military operation"" to disarm and ""denazify"" its southern neighbour, a democratic country of 44 million people.

Luhansk governor Serhiy Gaidai said 59 civilians had been killed in the region since the start of the war, which he said had entirely destroyed some residential areas.

""There is not one community that hasn't been under fire,"" he said on national television, naming the towns of Severodonetsk, Rubizhne and Popasna as particular hotspots.

Efforts to evacuate civilians have been hampered by the fighting, but the local authorities hope a temporary ceasefire can be agreed for Saturday to allow trucks to distribute food, medicine and other aid to people most in need.

Bordering Russia, Luhansk lies in Ukraine's coal-rich Donbass region that has been partly controlled by Russia-backed separatists since 2014. Governor Gaidai is the head of the region's Ukrainian administration.

Arnold Schwarzenegger made an impassioned appeal to the Russian people in a video posted on social media, asking them to resist their country's disinformation as the devastating invasion of Ukraine continues.

Schwarzenegger said he was ""sending this message through various different channels"" for Russian citizens and soldiers, and hoped his message about the atrocities committed by its government and military would break through. The video posted on Twitter has more than 16 million views.

""Ukraine did not start this war. Neither did nationalists or Nazis,"" he said. ""Those in power in the Kremlin started this war.""

Russian President Vladimir Putin and government officials have made false accusations toward Ukraine as their motivations for the invasion, baselessly saying the country must ""deNazify.""

""There are things that are going on in the world that are being kept from you, terrible things that you should know about,"" Schwarzenegger said.

""I know the Russian people are not aware such things are happening, so I urge the Russian people and the Russian soldiers in Ukraine to understand the propaganda and the disinformation that you are being told. I ask you to help me spread the truth.""

He heavily criticized the Russian government for the invasion, saying they ""lied not only to its citizens but to its soldiers"" for the reasons behind the war.

The attacks have affected more than twenty buildings in these towns and destroyed important infrastructure, according to the head of the Lugansk regional administration, the Interfax-Ukraine agency reported. “More than 20 apartment buildings and infrastructure facilities were destroyed in Severodonetsk and Rubizhne (Lugansk) on Friday night because of the bombings,” said Serhiy Haidai, head of the state administration of that region, whose self-proclaimed independence has been recognized by Russia. The regional official also confirmed the deaths of two people and that six were injured. The night bombing resumed on Friday morning, he said. In addition, “the artillery and multi-launch rocket systems of the Russian army targeted civilians in Severodonetsk and Rubizhne during the afternoon and evening of March 17-18,” said, for its part, the press service of the Regional State Administration, cites the Ukrainian local agency. He stressed that “in a few weeks, the Russians have turned these two cozy cities, full of young students, almost in ruins. These monsters open fire on homes and life-support facilities. It gives the impression that the goal of the Russians is to ruin Severodonetsk, Rubizhne and our other cities. They do everything they can to ensure that local residents do not have housing or communications,” he said.
