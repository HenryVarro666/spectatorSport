This was announced by Deputy Prime Minister - Minister for Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories of Ukraine Iryna Vereshchuk.

In particular, according to her, a corridor from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia will be opened (on the route Mariupol - Portivske - Manhush - bypassing Nikolske - Respublika village - Rozivka - Bilmak - Polohy - Orikhiv - Zaporizhzhia) with mandatory demining of the entire route.

""A convoy with humanitarian aid and buses to Mariupol will depart from Zaporizhzhia. We are waiting and hope that the route will work today,"" Iryna Vereshchuk said.

A corridor is also being launched from the town of Polohy, Zaporizhzhia region, in the direction of Zaporizhzhia (Polohy - Tokmak - Vasylivka - Kamyanske - Zaporizhzhia). A convoy of humanitarian aid and buses will depart from Zaporizhzhia to evacuate people from Polohy.

From Volnovakha to Pokrovsk, Donetsk region, a humanitarian corridor is opened along the route Volnovakha - Valeryanivka - Novoandriivka - Kyrylivka - Vuhledar - Pokrovsk.

""We really hope that this route will work today as well,"" said the Deputy Prime Minister.

The corridor from Enerhodar to Zaporizhzhia on the route Enerhodar - Dniprorudne - Vasylivka - Zaporizhzhia is also being launched.

The corridor from the city of Izyum to the city of Lozova, Kharkiv region, on the route Izyum - Mala Komyshuvakha - Barvinkove - Blyznyuky - Lozova is open. Evacuation buses will arrive from the town of Lozova, and humanitarian supplies are also planned.

A corridor is launched from the city of Bucha, Kyiv region, to Kyiv on the route Bucha - Vorzel - Mykhailivka-Rubezhivka - Shpytky - Bilohorodka - Kyiv. Buses will be sent from Kyiv to evacuate people.

Corridors are also open:

Clashes have continued in multiple parts of Ukraine as of March 10 as the foreign ministers of Ukraine and Russia failed to agree to a 24-hour ceasefire or on humanitarian relief for Mariupol during their meeting in Antalya, Turkey, earlier in the day.

Ukraine has attempted to establish humanitarian corridors to allow for the evacuation of cities affected by conflict March 10, notably including from Trostianets, Krasnopillia, and Sumy to Poltava, from Volnovakha to Pokrovsk, and from Izium to Lozova. Authorities have also indicated plans to open corridors from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia. There has been no official confirmation as to whether these corridors had been agreed upon with Russia or international humanitarian agencies. Authorities have also announced the opening of humanitarian corridors to evacuate individuals from towns west of Kyiv, including Bucha, Borodianka, Irpen, and Hostomel, to the capital despite occasional shelling. Evacuation efforts were previously interrupted in Mariupol, with Ukrainian officials blaming Russian troops for shelling targets near convoys.

Heavy clashes and Russian bombardments have continued in multiple parts of the country. The most intense fighting has taken place in areas to the west and northwest of Kyiv, including Irpen and Dymer; Russian troops have also reportedly reached the northeastern outskirts of Kyiv near Brovary. Heavy fighting has continued on the outskirts of Chernihiv city as well as elsewhere in Chernihiv Oblast, particularly near Hlukiv. An airstrike on a maternity hospital in Mariupol reportedly killed three people and wounded at least 17 others March 9.

Russian troops have encircled or partially encircled the cities of Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, Chernihiv, Mariupol, and Sumy. Kherson, Melitopol, and Berdyansk are under Russian occupation.

According to figures released by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights March 9, at least 516 civilians have been killed and 908 others wounded since Russia's offensive against Ukraine began Feb. 24.

Martial Law, Curfews, Disruptions

Martial law and a nationwide general military mobilization are in effect. Males ages 18-60 are prohibited from leaving the country. Curfews are in effect 22:00-06:00 in multiple regions, including Cherkasy, Lviv, Poltava, Vinnytsia, Volyn, Zaporizhzhia, and Zhytomyr. Curfew hours are 18:00-06:00 in Chernihiv and Kharkiv, 19:00-06:00 in Odesa and Mykolaiv, 20:00-06:00 in Dnipro and Kherson, 20:00-07:00 in Kyiv, and 22:00-07:00 in Ivano-Frankivsk. Depending on the ground situation, authorities may extend or amend curfew hours on short notice. Civilians must stay indoors during curfew hours; exemptions are in place for persons seeking urgent medical care and workers in critical infrastructure. Public transport is unavailable during curfew hours.

Reports indicate a shortage of basic supplies, including groceries and pharmaceutical products, in Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Polohy, and Mariupol; similar situations are likely in other cities facing Russian ground offensives. Other conflict-impacted cities will likely continue to see queues at ATMs, supermarkets, and petrol stations, as well as significant traffic congestion on major westward roads.

Ukrainian authorities have closed the country's borders with Belarus, Russia, and the Transnistria region of Moldova to foreign nationals; only Ukrainian citizens can enter from these areas. Reports also indicate significant road travel disruptions at Ukraine's western borders as thousands of civilians flee the conflict, though congestion has reportedly eased. Ukraine's borders with Hungary, Moldova, Poland, and Slovakia remain open; these states have increased security at their respective borders with Ukraine to aid in the reception of refugees. Significant delays at border crossings into neighboring states will likely persist and may worsen depending on conflict developments elsewhere in the country.

Critical Infrastructure

Metro services in Kyiv are intermittent; trains do not operate during curfew hours and will likely cease during air raids as many stations function as bomb shelters. Rail and road routes to the south and west of Kyiv remain largely operational, though the railway connection between Kyiv and Irpen was destroyed March 5. Civilian aviation remains suspended in Ukraine, and the nation's seaports are closed. Russia has temporarily stopped commercial shipping in the Sea of Azov.

Slovakia has resumed international rail services with Ukraine. Ukrainian Railways (UZ) is currently operating evacuation trains from multiple regions, including Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kryvyi Rih, Zakarpattia, Zaporizhzhia, and Odesa regions. UZ continues to operate intermittent services throughout much of the country, though reports indicate severe delays and congestion. Rail services are subject to disruptions with little warning. Reports indicate large crowds at several operational stations, particularly in Lviv, from where evacuation services to international destinations are coordinated.

Intermittent telecommunications and internet disruptions continue across much of the country. Power, water, gas, and other utilities or amenities have been disrupted throughout Sumy Oblast, as well as in Okhtyrka, Mariupol, and Kharkiv. Similar utility disruptions are highly likely in other urban centers facing artillery and rocket bombardment.

The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) only allows the withdrawal of up to UAH 30,000 (USD 1,000) in cash from foreign currency accounts. It has limited the permitted cash withdrawal from domestic currency accounts to UAH 100,000 (USD 3,340) per day. The bank has also suspended cross-border currency payments and the replenishment of electronic wallets.

Context

Russian forces continue in their apparent attempt to encircle Kyiv, with fierce clashes taking place on the city's eastern and western outskirts while additional Russian forces reportedly move into the area from the north and northeast.

Russian advances in the Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions have effectively cut Ukraine off from the Sea of Azov. Further advances to the west of Kherson toward Mykolaiv and Odesa threaten to cut Ukraine off from supplies via the Black Sea. Despite failing to capture Mykolaiv thus far, Russian troops are attempting to advance westward along the Black Sea coast. Additional advances in these regions will likely aid Russian forces in a potential future assault on the southwestern city of Odesa.

Despite recent bilateral negotiations, Russia and Ukraine's positions are almost certain to remain irreconcilable. Ukraine demands a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian forces, while Russia demands Ukraine surrender, disarm, and declare itself to be a neutral country remaining outside NATO and the EU. Nonetheless, Russia and Ukraine did agree during talks March 7 to establish humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians and deliver essential goods to areas impacted by the heaviest fighting.

Advice

Avoid travel to Ukraine until the situation stabilizes; consider exiting the country if safe to do so. Where fighting or airstrikes are occurring, shelter in place until the situation becomes clear. If officials report incoming fire, stay away from windows and exterior walls. Strictly heed the instructions of local security personnel, particularly when ordered to air-raid shelters. Stockpile food, fuel, and water when possible and safe to do so. Maintain contact with your diplomatic representation. Confirm that a thorough communication plan exists to ensure rapid accountability for all personnel operating in Ukraine. Reconfirm the status of public transport services, road routes, and borders before departure.

Due to shelling by the aggressor, no one has been evacuated via the humanitarian corridor from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia, as planned, and humanitarian aid could not reach the city.

Quote: ""The worst situation is in Mariupol-Zaporizhzhia. No one has been evacuated. Not a single drop of water has reached people who are exhausted from thirst.""

""300,000 people today are suffering from lack of water, cold and hunger. The aggressor’s revenge is not allowing us to save them.""

Details: According to Vereshchuk, there is currently only one road from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia, via Orikhiv and Polohy, as all other roads have been destroyed or mined.

""Every day, when our humanitarian cargo sets off for the road, the aggressor fires at the cargo, fires in the direction of movement, not allowing it to pass even a kilometre,"" she said.

She called on the international community to investigate this crime against humanity as soon as possible, as well as to strengthen sanctions against Russia.

""We ask the international community to link the strengthening of sanctions with the failure to open up humanitarian corridors, because the aggressor is deliberately destroying the civilian population,"" she said.

""It is extremely surprising, to be honest, this hatred of Mariupol. I do not know why it is, and whether it makes any sense from a military point of view. But the way the people of Mariupol are tortured… By the way, there are many foreigners there - Turkish citizens, Greeks, more than 300 in all. The OSCE mission is also there with people, and they can't leave, ""Vereshchuk said.

Earlier: The aggressors are constantly disrupting the planned evacuation from Mariupol, where the situation has worsened to a humanitarian catastrophe.

On the morning of 10 March, Vereshchuk announced the opening of the Mariupol-Portovske-Mangush humanitarian corridor, bypassing Nikolske-Respublika-Rozivka-Bilmak-Polohe-Orikhiv-Zaporizhzhia, with demining required along the entire route.

However, she later said that Mariupol was still blocked from evacuation.

On 10 March, Russian military forces launched a new air strike on Mariupol. At around 4.30 pm on 9 March, the aggressors dropped several powerful bombs on a children's hospital and a maternity hospital in Mariupol.

In this essay, our editors attempt to assess the military situation in Ukraine based on the available data. This article was originally published in Russian on March 9, 2022. Meduza opposes the war and demands the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine.

In recent days (approximately from the 10th to 14th day of the war), the Russian incursion into the depths of Ukraine has stalled. The columns of advancing Russian battle groups are no longer moving any more than 10 kilometers (about 6 miles) a day. Meanwhile, the army continues to incur losses from Ukrainian counterattacks against the groups at the front as well as ambushes at the rear guard. Ukraine’s successes are documented and posted online by journalists and regular citizens with cellphones.

However, this does not mean that the invasion has come to a halt. According to the same Ukrainian photos and videos, geolocation shows that Russian troops have made significant advances toward their intended targets . This is true in many key areas on the several fronts that were formed since the beginning of the invasion:

Kyiv is essentially blocked from three sides. Masses of Russian troops have blocked the road leading west out of Kyiv in the direction of Zhytomyr and are moving south along the outskirts with an obvious objective of cutting off the city from all contact with the Western part of the country. The incursion continues despite constant pressure on both flanks from the directions of Kyiv and Zhytomyr. The Russian Army continues to incur losses here (per the posted videos which can been seen on our interactive map), but the Ukrainian Army cannot stop their advance completely.

Russian troops moving from Chernihiv and the Sumy region have approached the eastern and northeastern outskirts of Kyiv, Brovary, and the Boryspil Airport, and have fortified their positions there. Ukrainian active combat units in the rear guard attempting to divert Russian forces in Chernihiv (which is practically surrounded) have not been able to impede their advance. Equipment losses have also failed to stop these troops.

In the south, in the Zaporizhzhia region, the Ukrainian Army is attempting to close the breach that formed after its units were routed in the Azov Sea, while Russian troops are collecting abandoned Ukrainian equipment from their hastily evacuated military bases. Having joined forces with a group from the Donbas, Russian forces in the Zaporizhzhia region are moving north through the cities of Polohy and Hulyaipole. Their objective is probably to cut off all or part of the most powerful Ukrainian forces, which, before Russia’s full-scale invasion, had been concentrated on maintaining the Ukrainian military’s “line of contact” and resisting the forces of the self-proclaimed Donbas “republics.”

Russian combat groups from around the cities of Balakiya and Izyum are probably aiming to converge with the Russian group in Zaporizhzhia, moving south from Kharkiv. Izyum saw a number of battles in recent days, part of the city has been destroyed, but the true situation on the ground is unclear. If the city (an important transportation hub) is taken, Russia’s troops will be able to start moving toward the south or southwest.

In the Donbas itself, Russian forces have already “ ” Ukrainian troops around Mariupol and Volnovakha and are forming another “kettle” around Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk. In the past two days, Russian and “LNR” troops have taken these cities along with the large group of Ukrainian troops within them, which had been moving toward Luhansk prior to the invasion, from the north (from the direction of Russia) and from the south (from the direction of the “LNR”).

Around Kharkiv, Okhtyrka, and Sumy, the armies are exchanging fire and raids. The Russian Air Force is regularly bombing these cities but has not been able to make any significant gains on the ground. It’s possible that the Russian Army is not planning on any further advancement into these areas, with other directions — west of Sumy and south of Kharkiv — being higher priorities.

Finally, in a separate area unrelated to other directions, around Mykolayiv and in southwest Ukraine, Russian troops have incurred losses while attempting to make a quick break in the direction of Odesa. There is a video from early March with burnt-out artillery positions, damaged tanks, and damaged armored combat vehicles around Voznesensk, where there was a battle for the river crossing across the South Bug, near Bashtanka. Since then, the Russian Army has been massing forces in this area, as well as expanding the area under its control on the right bank of the Dnipro. The city of Mykolayiv is blockaded from the north and the east and under artillery fire.

How do we know all this? All modern-day wars take place under the “surveillance” of volunteers who gather and filter photos and videos, tossing out fakes and doubles. Their lists are completely transparent: the evidence of each loss can be verified by anyone. One of these lists, compiled by a group of authors who’ve “done the counts” on all recent wars, including Syria, Iraq, Libya, Karabakh, and the Donbas, can be found here.

The events of the past few days on our interactive map

You can also look at more traditional versions of this map that clearly mark which side controls what territories. The map also correlates well with data from open sources (photos, videos, and messages from Ukrainian municipal authorities on the situations in their territories).

Overall, the open sources create a rather contradictory picture . On the one hand, according to the video and photo documentation, the Russian Army is suffering nonstop defeats and incurring huge losses, first and foremost, in terms of equipment. On the other hand, the losses and defeats are taking place deeper and deeper into Ukrainian territory, ever closer to possible key targets in this phase of the war.

However, these two facts only appear to contradict one another. We must remember that these open sources provide only an incomplete picture, even with universal access to cellphones, cameras, and social networks. The warring sides also have fundamentally different political goals, tactics, and strategies. Therefore, the way they approach and present military matters is radically different.

The important thing to understand here As a rule, after a battle, one of the sides controls the battlefield (or has access to it), while the other does not. The former will probably be interested in showing the world its opponents’ losses rather than its own. However, in the case of Ukraine, the people documenting the losses have access to the entire territory of the country regardless of the position of the fronts because the majority of them are civilians. One of the sides may be more eager to gather documentation of losses than the other. In the case of the war in Ukraine, this is clearly the case since Russian troops are forbidden from taking photos or videos for social media. The exception has been Chechnya, whose National Guard troops are actively broadcasting their actions. Additionally, information about Ukrainian losses is usually reported by pro-government Russian journalists who are only allowed into a small handful of active combat zones. The majority of known Ukrainian losses in equipment and ammunition are documented in the Donbas, north of Kyiv (where the Chechen units are located), and, in recent days, in the Kherson region. Previously, a small portion of Ukrainian losses had been reported by Ukrainian civilians who confused lost Ukrainian equipment for Russian hardware. The Ukrainian government is conducting a campaign to publicize Russian losses and clearly considers this one of its most important instruments of warfare directed at Russian citizens. If Russians are “sensitized” to the losses, goes the logic, this may cause political pressure on the Kremlin. For its part, the Kremlin wants to keep Russian citizens away from any unofficial information and simply blocks or shuts down these media channels at home.

Open sources tell us a lot about the problems, losses, and misfortunes incurred by the Russian Army but very little about what is going on with the Ukrainian side, which has lost several areas and entire regions in the south and in the Donbas. Fragmentary information in Western media outlets paints a picture of heavy losses and terrible problems on the Ukrainian side.

A New York Times article published on March 6, based on interviews with Ukrainian officers, speaks of serious defeats and heavy combat sustained by the Ukrainian Army’s surrounded 59th Brigade in the south of the country during the first days of the war. According to its commanders, the brigade was attacked by Russian forces five times its size and was constantly under aerial assault (which it had nothing to defend itself from, since a significant portion of antiaircraft defenses had been recalled to Kyiv on the eve of the war). As a result, they were surrounded on the left bank of the Dnipro, where they incurred heavy losses of tanks and artillery. Then, what remained of the brigade managed to cross the river into Kherson. They were forced to leave the city under a new threat of siege, which would have meant total destruction for the remaining units. Now, what remains of the brigade is attempting to hold back the Russian incursion into Kherson alongside other units who have arrived from elsewhere.

The details of combat in another area of the southern front, in Melitopol and Berdyansk, have yet to be released. However, pro-government Russian journalists were allowed to photograph the captured Ukrainian artillery battalion base with its abandoned equipment and supplies.

Obviously, both sides are incurring heavy casualties . The Ukrainian ones increase when its active army units are surrounded. Encircling or creating the threat of encircling subdivisions or entire divisions seems to have become the Russian military’s primary objective in this phase of the war. The purpose of this is apparently to destroy a significant part of the Ukrainian Army as an organizing force in the Donbas, on the left bank of the Dnipro, and in Kyiv. In the past several days, the Russian Army has surrounded Mariupol and Chernihiv, and has clearly been preparing to continue its operations aimed at surrounding other areas.

Regardless, this does not mean that the war is going according to the Russian Joint Staff’s plan. The objectives and pace of the operations outlined in this plan are unknown to the public, but things are clearly not going the way they were planned, judging by the changes in how military operations are being conducted, as well as the apparent problems and losses we have observed from open sources.

Clearly, the Russian Army has run into unanticipated logistical problems: in various areas, the supply lines have been severely damaged, which affects the units at the front.

Frontline units are also experiencing problems with reconnaissance. Based on the data from open sources (namely, videos showing damaged and abandoned equipment), reconnaissance is being conducted by small groups that are dispersed in various directions, traveling with a handful of tanks and armored vehicles that are then damaged by the enemy’s artillery fire, anti-tank weapons, and counterattack tanks.

Russian artillery — at least the units around Kharkov and Mykolayiv — have experienced palpable losses from Ukrainian artillery. This speaks to the fact that these units are not universally superior in terms of reconnaissance, targeting, and fire power. At the same time, before the invasion, it was believed that one of the Russian Army’s biggest advantages was precisely its artillery. In the north and west of Kyiv, and in the Donbas, it seems that the Russian Army does indeed have this advantage.

The Russian command seems to have decided against deploying heliborne assaults behind enemy lines. The risks for the troops in the air and on the ground appear to be greater than the advantages that may be gained from taking targets deep behind enemy lines.

Deep incursions down roads with advancing troops are no longer being attempted. The closer the Russian Army has gotten to its targets, the greater the resistance it has faced, alongside increasing difficulty in providing supplies and reinforcements. This is precisely why the invasion has slowed down so much. Each operation now seems to demand that the Army first mass its forces, whether they’re blockading cities and towns in the rear or at the front.

The Ukrainian Army’s strategy is driven by defending large cities with operations based in more or less the same locations as before the war. Around the cities falling along the path of the Russian invasion, they are conducting shelling with their artillery and anti-tank missiles. The troops regularly counterattack using mobile combat units with tanks (this was the case around Kharkiv, Chernihiv, and Mykolayiv). All of this is forcing the Russian troops to seek out new pathways for their advance and their supply lines, and waste their energy on blockading cities and, in the future, potentially, on storming them. This slows down (and, in places, even halts) the Russian invasion. However, the overall strategy and military situation for the Ukrainian Army continues to deteriorate .

At the same time, despite expectations to the contrary, two weeks into the war, the battle for the airspace continues. Here, just as it had before the war, the Russian Army has the advantage, but the Ukrainian Army and antiaircraft defenses, despite what Putin has said about them, still exist and are even capable of operating, albeit in a limited capacity . Maintaining battle-ready Ukrainian antiaircraft systems (capable at least of defensive use) has so far meant that the more Russia has tried to deploy its aerial forces, the greater its losses.

The inability to gain total supremacy in the air while being significantly richer in resources is probably related to Russia’s problems with organizing reconnaissance. Moscow finds itself in this situation despite the fact that the Ukrainian military has experienced no fewer problems with its Air Force and air defenses (including some losses likely caused by friendly fire).

Background:

February, 24 – Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized a ""special military operation"" against Ukraine, Reuters report. A number of cities of Ukraine suffered a missile attack. Missiles hit several military facilities in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Dnipro cities. ""Putin has just launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Peaceful Ukrainian cities are under strikes. This is a war of aggression,"" wrote Ukrainian MoF Dmytro Kuleba on Twitter. ""Today, on 24 of February, at 5.00 AM the armed forces of the Russian Federation launched an intensive shelling of our units on east, delivered missile/bomb strikes on airfields in Boryspil, Ozerne, Kulbakino, Chuhuiv, Kramatorsk, Chornobaivka, as well as on military infrastructure of the Armed Forces of Ukraine,"" the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine wrote on Facebook: ""At the same time the aggressor started artillery shelling of the areas and settlements along the state border and administrative boundary with the temporarily occupied territory of Crimea."" National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, headed by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, imposed martial law across the country, the decision was approved by the Ukrainian government during an emergency session. Earlier Putin recognized the Russia-backed regions of Eastern Ukraine as ""independent"" entities, the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics. The executive order on the recognition of those illegal formations included a point on military cooperation and ""peacekeeping"" functions of the Russian Army in those regions. The next day Putin ordered his military to enter Donbas and asked the government for permission to use Russian Forces outside the country – and received it shortly after. Since the very first day of the invasion, Russia has been struggling to achieve any significant success. Ukrainian Army effectively repels attacks on the land, but Russia has an advantage in the sky. Because of that one of the acute issues is to make NATO shelter the Ukrainian sky from Russian missiles and aircraft. The Presidential Office of Ukraine said, that Vladimir Putin's plan to quickly take control over the key objectives and take down the Ukrainian government is ruined. Ukrainian officials suggest that Kyiv, the capital, is the primary aim of the Russian invasion. It is being shelled daily. Ukraine united and swiftly established defense. Thousands of people voluntarily joined Territorial Defense, servicemen were mobilized across the country. Curfew was imposed. National Police along with Territorial Defense hunt for Russian saboteur-reconnaissance groups. Russia uses terroristic methods, targeting civilians and shelling non-military facilities of ecological significance. The aggressor has already caused an ecological disaster – a major oil processing and storage facility was hit by a Russian missile. The radioactive background is heightened due to Russian activities in Chornobyl. Later Russian troops capture the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant. Fightings in Hostomel, where a strategically significant Antonov Airport is situated, were one of the toughest of the first days. Over 60 Russian helicopters and other aircraft were engaged in the attack, but Ukrainian Army managed to regain control of the area. Due to the lack of concrete successes, Russian started on fourth and next days attacks on civilians. Kharkiv and Chernihiv were shelled by BM-21 ""Grad"" multiple rocket launchers. On March 1, the sixth day, a cruise missile hit the central square in Kharkiv. As a result, at least ten people were killed, more than 20 were injured. State Emergency Service is continuing to rescue people from the rubble. Kyiv TV Tower, a civilian object for broadcast was hit by a missile. Five people were killed, five Tower personnel were injured. A few hours before that happened, the Ukrainian Minister of Defense warned that Russia was preparing an info&psycho attack, and for that, they would try to cut off the information network. The war crimes of Russia will be investigated by the International Criminal Court in Hague. The ICC Prosecutor, Karim A.A. Khan QC, has personally launched an investigation into the Situation in Ukraine. Many Russian occupiers surrender, unwilling to fight. They claim to have been deceived by Russian authorities – they were had been deployed under the pretext of military drills but then forced to participate in war. The whole reconnaissance platoon of the Russian 34th Motorized Rifle Brigade surrendered to Ukrainian Armed Forces. The whole world condemns Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions. 38 countries closed their skies to Russian aircraft. Even Switzerland deviated from its traditional neutrality to impose European sanctions on Russia. The European Commission of the European Union has approved cutting off Russian banks from SWIFT – the global provider of secure financial messaging services. Private companies also show their support: SpaceX, Google, Meta, and many other giants have expressed their support and offered their help. The President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy received a proposal of negotiations. The first round of them resulted in no decisions yet. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian President has signed the Ukrainian Government's application for the membership of Ukraine in the European Union and urges for the special procedure of accepting Ukraine to the EU. The next day the European Parliament held an extraordinary plenary session in Brussels to assess Russia’s military assault on Ukraine. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy held a speech, greeted with standing applause. After a vote by the EU Parliament Ukraine got a recommendation on being granted a candidate status for EU membership.

Numerous protests have happened across the world, and even more to happen. Even in the cities in the Russian blockade, Ukrainian citizens rally against occupiers. Russian troops shoot into the air and even on civilians, but rebels continue to force them away, even without weapons. Kherson, Mariupol, and many other cities rise against aggressors despite humanitarian catastrophes – power and water supply were cut off, there is a lack of food, many residential houses were damaged, impossible to live in. Ukraine is trying to establish humanitarian corridors to evacuate citizens but Russian forces repeatedly violate the ceasefire.

On Friday, March 4 Ukraine's president condemned NATO leaders over their refusal to implement a no-fly zone around the country. In a fiery speech, Volodymyr Zelensky said the West's reluctance to intervene had given Russia ""a green light"" to continue bombarding towns and villages. In his speech from Kyiv, Mr Zelensky said he disagreed that direct action could ""provoke Russia's direct aggression against NATO"".",https://en.defence-ua.com/news/day_14th_of_ukraines_defense_against_russian_invasion_live_updates-2227.html
