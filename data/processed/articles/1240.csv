ODESSA, Ukraine — The beach where locals and tourists sunbathe in the summer is now covered in mines. The sand is being shoveled into sacks that can be used as both roadblocks and glass fortification. Gaze out across the Black Sea in some parts of the city and Russian warships are visible.

People in Odessa, a critical port and Ukraine’s third-largest city with about 1 million people, are not wondering if Russia plans to launch an assault here. They are sure it will. Of Ukraine’s southern cities, Odessa is the most economically strategic — which is what makes it a no-doubt target for Russian forces who have laid siege other ports to the east.

An attack on Odessa could come from the warships. It could come from the east, where Russian forces already control the port of Kherson and have advanced north to Mykolaiv. It could even come from the west, what was considered the preferred evacuation route to the Moldovan border. Russian forces are posted in the breakaway enclave of Transnistria along a swath of the border with Moldova and Ukraine.

In the past two days, Russia’s warships have been spotted near Odessa’s Chernomorsk and Zatoka beaches, where an amphibious landing is most likely because of favorable geographical conditions, said Alexander Velmozhko, the press secretary of the local Territorial Defense forces.

So Odessa, known in Ukraine for its residents’ unique sense of humor, is steeling itself for the worst.

In a new video posted on March 6, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that Russian forces are preparing to bomb Odessa. (Video: The Washington Post)

“Now’s not the time for jokes,” said Eduard Shevchenko, who works with the Park Kultury volunteer organization that cares for retirees and brought 86-year-old Olga Lyashenko some nonperishable foods on Friday afternoon.

Lyashenko uses a walker, so evacuating was a nonstarter, she said. The underground basement in her building that was being used to store trash has been cleaned out so it can be a bomb shelter. But her neighbor, also in her 80s, is not impressed. “It’s gross,” the neighbor commented.

When the air-raid sirens went off, neither woman made a move from the ninth-floor apartment to shelter.

“I grew up in war,” said Lyashenko, who was born in 1936 and remembers the World War II Romanian occupation of the city. The iconic Odessa Opera and Ballet Theater was nearly bombed then, she said. The building dates back to 1887, when this city was a showcase of Imperial Russia. It’s still standing, located just a few blocks from the beach, and is now surrounded by sandbags and antitank barricades.

In eastern Ukraine’s Kharkiv, a majority Russian-speaking city like Odessa, the opera theater was one of the buildings damaged in missile strikes on the city’s downtown.

“I’m crying all of the time,” said Odessa resident Kristina Botushan. “I have friends in the cities that have been attacked. What’s happening in them is hell.”

Ukraine’s shoreline has been a particular point of focus for Russia’s military.

Heavy fighting continues in Mariupol, the main port city in the Sea of Azov near Crimea, which Russia forcibly annexed from Ukraine in 2014. The nearby port of Berdyansk is now in Russian hands.

Russian forces from the Crimean Peninsula advanced northeast to Melitopol and also northwest to Kherson, a city of about 300,000 people about 90 miles from Odessa.

While Ukraine has anti-ship missiles to defend the shore, the country’s naval fleet is considered a particular weak spot in its defense. It lost most of its ships when Russia seized a key base in 2014. The vessels it has now don’t have missiles. The navy has no modern frigates.

The pride of its fleet, the Hetman Sahaidachny flagship, was undergoing repairs in Mykolaiv, a port Russian forces are advancing on. The ship’s commander gave the order to sink it so it “would not be captured by the enemy,” Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov wrote on Facebook.

“It is difficult to imagine a more tough decision for a brave warrior and the whole team,” Reznikov said. “But we will build a new fleet, modern and powerful. The main thing now is to resist.”

Odessa has spent days preparing to do just that.

The city’s 7 p.m. curfew is strict. Its downtown streets, known for stunning, delicate architecture, are now lined with stone barriers and antitank “hedgehogs” fashioned out of metal bars. Throughout the city, the now-famous response from the nearby Snake Island border guards — “Russian warship, go f--- yourself” — is posted on billboards around the city.

“The greeting, ‘Glory to Ukraine,’ has become the most common in Ukraine,” said Alexander Slavskiy, who headed a government fund 10 days ago but is now a soldier with the area’s Territorial Defense. “Before this, it wasn’t like that. The city is mobilizing. Everyone who wanted to leave, evacuated, but so many people stayed.”

As distant shelling could be heard from a small park in the Odessa’s downtown, a group of men went ahead with their regular games of chess and dominoes at tables outside. They won’t abandon their home, they said. But they’re scared of what they’re now sure is headed for this city.

“Chess is a peaceful game that forces you to think and be creative,” said 59-year-old Vladislav Vasytinski-Kazimir, who was born in Odessa. “It would be better if the militaries sat down at a chess table and figured things out instead of staring through a scope or firing missiles.”

A government official told The Associated Press that elevated levels of radiation were detected near the plant, which provides about 25% of Ukraine’s power generation. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the information has not yet been publicly released.

Plant spokesman Andriy Tuz told Ukrainian television that shells were falling directly on the Zaporizhzhia plant in the city of Enerhodar and had set fire to one of the facility’s six reactors. That reactor is under renovation and not operating, but there is nuclear fuel inside, he said.

Russian forces pressed their attack on a crucial energy-producing city by shelling Europe’s largest nuclear plant early Friday, sparking a fire and raising fears that radiation could leak from the damaged power station.

Temporary Protected Status is given to citizens of countries devastated by war or natural disasters.

“Russia’s premeditated and unprovoked attack on Ukraine has resulted in an ongoing war, senseless violence, and Ukrainians forced to seek refuge in other countries,” Mayorkas said in a statement.

The Department of Homeland Security will grant temporary legal status to Ukrainians living in the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Thursday that Temporary Protected Status would be extended for 18 months.

International Atomic Energy Agency said in a tweet that it is aware of reports of shelling at Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant and is in contact with Ukrainian authorities about the situation.

""The director of the plant said that the nuclear safety is now guaranteed. According to those responsible for the plant, a training building and a laboratory were affected by the fire,"" Oleksandr Starukh, head of the military administration of the Zaporizhzhia region, said on Facebook.

Ukrainian authorities said the safety of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was now secured, after a fire broke out Friday when the station came under fire from invading Russian forces.

Grossi “appeals for halt of use of force and warns of severe danger if reactors hit,” the IAEA said in another tweet.

The agency said its Director General Mariano Grossi was in touch with Ukraine’s Prime Minister Denys Schmygal and the Ukrainian regulator and operator about the situation at the Zaporizhzhia plant.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said on Twitter that it’s been informed by Ukraine’s nuclear regulator that “there has been no change reported in radiation levels” at a nuclear power station shelled by Russian troops.

This was the fourth evacuation flight to have landed in Mumbai. Another flight, this one from Budapest, is likely to land in Mumbai around 8 am on Friday, the official said. Interacting with passengers, Danve said the evacuation operation will continue till all those stranded in war-torn Ukraine are brought back to India.

An Air India Express flight from Bucharest carrying 185 Indians stranded in Ukraine landed in Mumbai on Friday, an official said. Union minister Raosaheb Danve welcomed the passengers as soon as the Air India Express Flight IX 1204 landed at 2 am.

Biden also got another update on the situation from the undersecretary for nuclear security at the U.S. Department of Energy and the administrator of the U.S. National Nuclear Security Administration.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy updated U.S. President Joe Biden about the fire at a nuclear power station shelled by Russian troops. The White House said Biden and Zelenskyy urged Russia to cease its military activities in the area and allow firefighters and emergency responders to access the site.

Russian troops attacked the Ukrainian nuclear plant -- Europe's largest -- early Friday local time, with images on a live feed showing blasts lighting up the night sky and sending up plumes of smoke.

Biden joined Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ""in urging Russia to cease its military activities in the area and allow firefighters and emergency responders to access the site,"" a White House readout of a call between the two leaders said.

US President Joe Biden on Thursday urged Russia to stop its military activities at a Ukrainian nuclear power plant and to allow in emergency services.

""As of 05:20 at the Zaporizhzhia NPP in Energodar, State Emergency Service units went to put out the fire in the training building,"" the state emergency services wrote on Facebook, noting that 40 people and 10 vehicles were involved in the operation.

Ukraine's emergency services said Friday they had gained access to a nuclear power plant where a fire erupted after shelling by the Russian military.

""No country other than Russia has ever fired on nuclear power units,"" he said in a video message released by his office. ""This is the first time in our history. In the history of mankind. The terrorist state now resorted to nuclear terror.""

He begged world leaders to wake up and prevent Europe from ""dying from a nuclear disaster"" after the continent's largest plant caught fire after it was shelled.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Moscow Friday of resorting to ""nuclear terror"" and wanting to ""repeat"" the Chernobyl disaster after he said invading Russian forces attacked a nuclear power plant.

China, whose bilateral relationship with Russia has strengthened in recent years, has thus far avoided criticizing Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.

In a statement issued Thursday, the AIIB said that ""in the best interests of the bank, management has decided that all activities relating to Russia and Belarus are on hold and under review"".

The China-backed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank said it will suspend business related to Russia and Belarus in a sign of the two countries' deepening pariah status over the war in Ukraine.

Johnson's office says he and Zelenskyy agree Russia must immediately cease attacking and allow emergency services unfettered access to the plant. The two agree a ceasefire is essential.

Johnson's office says he spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the early hours of the morning. He says Britain will raise the issue immediately with Russia and close partners.

The office of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he will seek an emergency UN Security Council meeting after Russian troops in Ukraine attacked a nuclear power plant and sparked a fire.

He repeated the call later in a series of tweets, saying ""the only people who can fix this are the Russian people.""

""How does this end? Somebody in Russia has to step up to the plate... and take this guy out,"" the senator told conservative Fox News TV host Sean Hannity.

Senior US senator Lindsey Graham called for ""somebody in Russia"" to assassinate President Vladimir Putin after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in a televised interview Thursday evening.

As per ANI, quoting Russian News Agency TASS, 30 Russian buses are ready to evacuate Indian students and other foreigners from Ukraine’s Kharkiv and Sumy to Russia’s Belgorod Region, Russian National Defense Control Center head Colonel General Mikhail Mizintsev announced .

On 27 February, the country created an “International Legion of Territorial Defence” to help them stand up to the Russian military, which is bigger and more powerful than theirs. Four days on, the first batch of foreign fighters have reportedly reached the conflict-hit nation. “Ukraine is already greeting foreign volunteers. The first 16,000 are already on their way to protect freedom and life for us, and for all,” Zelenskyy said in a video address posted on Facebook on Thursday.

NATO countries are providing military aid to Ukraine and amid calls of help from President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thousands of foreign fighters have volunteered to fight along with Ukrainian soldiers.

More than a week after the Russian invasion, the war in Ukraine is escalating. The civilian death toll is on the rise, cities are falling to Russian troops, and now a fire at Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s biggest nuclear plant, has sent alarm bells ringing.

Indian carriers -- Air India Express, Air India, SpiceJet, IndiGo, Vistara and Go First -- are expected to operate a total of 17 flights on Friday, the ministry's statement noted.

More than 7,400 Indians are expected to be brought back to India from Ukraine's neighbouring countries on special flights in the next two days, the Civil Aviation Ministry said on Thursday.

“Today, we heard reports that a student leaving Kyiv was shot at. He was taken back to Kyiv. This will happen in fighting,” the minister told media persons. Recently on March 1, a young Indian medical student, Naveen SG of Karnataka, was killed in shelling in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv when he ventured out to buy food for himself and fellow students.

An Indian student has reportedly been shot at and injured in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, Minister of State for Civil Aviation VK Singh said on Friday. Singh is in Poland currently to facilitate the evacuation of Indians stranded in war-hit Ukraine.

The statement said plant staff were continuing to operate the reactor and supply power according to normal safety rules.

""The territory of the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant is occupied by the armed forces of the Russian Federation,"" the agency said of the site in Zaporizhzhia, Europe's largest.

Russian forces have entered the site of a Ukrainian nuclear power plant that caught fire overnight during clashes, the Ukrainian nuclear inspectorate said Friday.

He was responding to questions on the uncertainty over when Naveen's body would be brought back to Haveri, his hometown.

Arvind Bellad, the BJP MLA representing the Hubli-Dharwad constituency in Karnataka, said instead of a coffin, nearly eight to 10 people can be accommodated on the plane.

As the family of Naveen Shekharappa Gyanagowda, the student killed in Ukraine, wait for his body to be flown back to Karnataka, a BJP MLA has stirred up a controversy with his comment that ""a dead body takes up more space in a flight"", reports NDTV .

The statement said plant staff were continuing to operate the reactor and supply power according to normal safety rules.

""The territory of the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant is occupied by the armed forces of the Russian Federation,"" the agency said of the site in Zaporizhzhia, Europe's largest.

“If Russia is destroyed, we will be next. This is for sure,” said Wang Yongchun, a retiree in Beijing. “The United States wants to dominate the world.” Such comments reflect the stance of a ruling party that is the closest thing Putin has to a major ally: The war should stop but the United States is to blame.

As the West condemns Russia, President Vladimir Putin has vocal supporters in China, where the ruling Communist Party tells its people they are fellow targets of US-led harassment, reports AP.

""Overnight we have also seen reports about the attack against the nuclear power plant. This just demonstrates the recklessness of this war and the importance of ending it and the importance of Russia withdrawing all its troops and engaging good faith in diplomatic efforts,"" Stoltenberg said ahead of a meeting with Western foreign ministers.

NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg on Friday decried Russia's ""recklessness"" over the shelling of a nuclear power plant in Ukraine and demanded Moscow stop the war against its neighbour.

Singh later tweeted that relief teams will be on ground in four countries to assist those fleeing Ukraine.

The video was shared by Ravinder Singh, the CEO and founder of Khalsa Aid. “These guys were fortunate to get on this train which is traveling east of Ukraine to the west (to the Polish border). Hardeep Singh has been providing Langar assistance to many students from different countries,” he wrote in the caption.

The victims of the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, who are fleeing the war-torn country, are finding a comforting company in an unlikely bunch of Good Samaritans – the volunteers of Khalsa Aid. The members of Khalsa Aid, an international non-profit humanitarian organisation, recently made news as a video of them went viral distributing ‘langar on trains’ to those fleeing the conflict to neighbouring countries.

Our office ""is being searched,"" the Civic Assistance Committee wrote on social media, adding that the reason for the search was not clear. ""Employees inside are forbidden from using their phones and they are out of contact,"" the organisation added.

Russian police were carrying out searches Friday at the offices of the country's most prominent migrant aid centre, the organisation said, shortly after law enforcement entered the offices of banned rights group Memorial.

The Russian offensive against Ukraine has been limited mostly to land or air, with Moscow using missiles and rockets. However, a recent tweet has brought the focus to the sea. A tweet, which has gone viral since being posted, shows Ukrainian Navy flagship Hetman Sahaidachny being scuttled in Nikolaev.

Mentioning the Ukraine-Russia crisis, the PM said, ""We have brought thousands of students from Ukraine under Operation Ganga safely. And those who are left there, our aeroplanes are flying.""

""The entire world now is passing through a 'najuk daur' (delicate period) of this century. Many countries are today affected by epidemic, disturbance and uncertainty. But you must have seen, however deep the crisis is India's attempts (to address them) are even bigger,"" he said.

Stating that the entire world is passing through a delicate period now, Prime Minister Narendra Modi Friday said irrespective of how deep the crisis is India's response is even bigger. Addressing an election rally, the PM also said that thousands of students have been brought back from Ukraine safely under the ongoing Operation Ganga, and those who are still there are being evacuated.

""An immediate reinforcement of sanctions against the nuclear terrorist state is necessary,"" he declared, amid fears that fighting at the Zaporizhzhia plant could trigger a nuclear accident.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky demanded still tougher sanctions against his Moscow foes on Friday after invading Russian forces attacked and seized a nuclear plant.

He said that the Ukrainians are still in control of the reactor.

International Atomic Energy Agency Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi said Friday that the building hit was a training center and not part of the reactor.

Earlier reports conflicted over what part of the plant was affected by fire that broke out after shelling. Nuclear plant spokesman Andriy Tuz told Ukrainian television overnight that shells fell directly on the facility, and set fire to reactor that is not operating and to an administrative training building.

The head of the United Nations' atomic agency a Ukrainian nuclear plant was hit by a Russian projectile but that the building was a training center.

If the Russian state media is to be believed, its forces have undertaken a military campaign in Ukraine to “liberate” its people. And it's the Ukrainians who are guilty. Olga Skabeyeva, a popular television anchor and political commentator, on Russia 1 state television, said in a recent broadcast, “In Kyiv, the witch hunt is underway.”

Thirty-two members of the 47-seat council voted to establish the highest-level probe possible into alleged rights violations, with an eye to holding perpetrators responsible.

The UN Human Rights Council on Friday overwhelmingly voted to create a high-level investigation into violations committed following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The vote Friday was the culmination of an urgent debate called by Ukraine, during which most council members lambasted Russia.

The Human Rights Council voted 32-2, with 13 abstentions, to pass a resolution that was presented by many Western countries and others who have spoken out against Moscow’s attack on its neighbor.

The UN’s top human rights body has voted overwhelmingly to appoint a three-person panel of experts to monitor human rights in Ukraine, where Russian forces are invading.

""The message to Putin has been clear: You're isolated on a global level and the whole world is against you,"" Ukrainian ambassador Yevheniia Filipenko told reporters after the vote.

An overwhelming vote at the UN Human Rights Council on Friday to investigate abuses following Russia's invasion of Ukraine should show President Vladimir Putin ""the whole world is against you"", Kyiv's ambassador said.

After the price revision, a tonne of HRC will cost around Rs 66,000, while the buyers will get TMT bars for about Rs 65,000 per tonne, the sources said on Friday.

India on Friday abstained in a vote in the UN Human Rights Council that has decided to urgently establish an independent international commission of inquiry as a result of Russia's aggression against Ukraine.

The Netherlands-based International Criminal Court is already investigating allegations that Russia has committed war crimes in Ukraine. But while it can investigate genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, Russia has not signed up to a separate ICC statute under which nations pledge not to commit “crimes of aggression.”

Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the call for a body to investigate the “crime of aggression” was based on the tribunals that prosecuted senior Nazis after World War II.

The Ukrainian government and a former British prime minister are pushing for a special criminal tribunal to prosecute Russian President Vladimir Putin and his allies over the invasion of Ukraine.

Cavusoglu said a meeting between Lavrov and Ukraine’s Dmytro Kuleba could be possible, but added that he was not certain Ukrainian officials would be able to attend.

Turkey’s foreign minister says Ankara wants to bring Russia and Ukraine’s top diplomats together for talks during an international diplomacy forum in the country next week.

The statement did not say how many Indians will be coming on the four IAF flights.

The 11 civilian flights are expected to bring back more than 2,200 Indians, with 10 landing in Delhi and one in Mumbai, the ministry said in a statement on Friday.

Eleven civilian and four Indian Air Force (IAF) flights will return to India on Saturday with Indians from Ukraine's neighbouring countries, the Civil Aviation Ministry has stated.

Bulletproof vests, helmets, tents, as well as generators, food, winter clothes and medical supplies will be delivered by Self-Defense Force aircraft, Matsuno said.

Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told reporters Friday that shipping and other logistical details are being finalized after a decision by the National Security Council.

It is a rare move by Japan, which has a principle of not shipping defense supplies to countries in conflict.

Japan is sending bulletproof vests, helmets and other defence supplies to Ukraine to help the country fight Russia's invasion.

""The economy is subjected to such an aggressive environment,"" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. ""We need to cushion, to minimise the attacks aimed at our economy now.""

The package of bills aims at ""defending the economy and citizens in the face of foreign sanctions,"" according to the website of the State Duma, the Russian parliament's lower house.

Russia's parliament on Friday approved legislation aimed at countering the effects of sweeping Western sanctions on the country's economy imposed after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

The IMA has recommended that this could be done following the modalities of distribution of students in other medical schools in India if an ongoing medical college is closed.

In a letter to Modi on Friday, the IMA stated that such students should be permitted to go to Indian medical colleges for the remainder of their MBBS course through an ""appropriate disbursed distribution"", but it should not be seen as an increase in the annual intake capacity.

Expressing concern about the future of medical students who have returned homfrom Ukraine, the Indian Medical Association has recommended to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that they be adjusted in India medical schools as a one-time measure.

""The British government will do everything it can to support the Ukrainian people at this critical moment as they fight for freedom, said Patel, ahead of her visit to Poland.

""We have numerous cases of, unfortunately, when Russian soldiers rape women in the Ukrainian cities,"" Kuleba told a briefing at London's Chatham House think-tank.

Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on Friday accused Russian troops of raping women and backed a call for the creation of a special tribunal to punish Moscow's aggression.

At a media briefing, he said India is primarily focusing on evacuating its nationals out of the conflict zones in eastern Ukraine including from Kharkiv and Sum, adding that the total number of Indians stuck in Ukraine could be roughly in the range of 2,000 to 3,000.

Arindam Bagchi, the spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), said that around 300 Indians are stranded in Kharkiv and 700 are in Sumy while some citizens out of over 900 are being taken out of Pisochyn in five buses.

India on Friday sought ceasefire by Russian and Ukrainian troops in eastern Ukraine for evacuation of Indian citizens stuck in conflict zones and said it is yet to see the implementation of the decision by the two sides to create safe corridors for the exit of the civilians.

Putin ""confirmed that Russia is open to dialogue with the Ukrainian side, as well as with everyone who wants peace in Ukraine. But under the condition that all Russian demands are met,"" the Kremlin said.

He added that dialogue on Ukraine would be possible only if Russian demands are met.

Putin said reports about ""the alleged ongoing air strikes of Kyiv and other large cities are gross propaganda fakes,"" the Kremlin said in a statement.

Russian President Vladimir Putin in a phone call with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz denied that Russian troops were bombing Ukrainian cities, dismissing such information as fake, the Kremlin said Friday.

""It leaves us no other option than to temporarily suspend the work of all BBC News journalists and their support staff within the Russian Federation while we assess the full implications of this unwelcome development,"" he added.

The corporation's director-general, Tim Davie, said the new legislation was ""unwelcome"" and ""appears to criminalise the process of independent journalism"".

Putin ""confirmed that Russia is open to dialogue with the Ukrainian side, as well as with everyone who wants peace in Ukraine. But under the condition that all Russian demands are met,"" the Kremlin said.

He added that dialogue on Ukraine would be possible only if Russian demands are met.

Putin said reports about ""the alleged ongoing air strikes of Kyiv and other large cities are gross propaganda fakes,"" the Kremlin said in a statement.

Russian President Vladimir Putin in a phone call with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz denied that Russian troops were bombing Ukrainian cities, dismissing such information as fake, the Kremlin said Friday.

""It leaves us no other option than to temporarily suspend the work of all BBC News journalists and their support staff within the Russian Federation while we assess the full implications of this unwelcome development,"" he added.

The corporation's director-general, Tim Davie, said the new legislation was ""unwelcome"" and ""appears to criminalise the process of independent journalism"".

Russia-Ukraine war LATEST updates: Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky demanded still tougher sanctions against his Moscow foes on Friday after invading Russian forces attacked and seized a nuclear plant.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has reportedly survived three assassination attempted in the last week.

The Czech government has declared a state of emergency from Friday in anticipation of a major influx of Ukrainian refugees fleeing the ongoing Russian invasion. “We are implementing it purely for technical reasons, so we can handle the influx of refugees,” Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said Wednesday during a press briefing.

An air defense unit near the resort of Zatoka (Odesa region) shot down a Russian aircraft that attacked one of the military infrastructure facilities, the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported, as per Interfax Ukraine.

Russian lawmakers on Friday approved legislation providing up to 15 years in jail for any publication of fake news about the Russian armed forces, one week after Moscow invaded Ukraine.

BJP MLA Arvind Bellad has come under fire over his controversial remark saying the delay over bringing back the body of killed Indian student Naveen Shekharappa Gyanagowda was because it takes more space to bring a body in a plane, adding that around eight to 10 people could be accommodated in that space.

Russia's media watchdog said Friday it had restricted access to several independent media websites, including the BBC, tightening controls over the internet more than one week after Russia invaded Ukraine.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday held a high-level meeting on the Russia-Ukraine crisis and reviewed the progress of Operation Ganga.

The office of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he will seek an emergency UN Security Council meeting after Russian troops in Ukraine attacked a nuclear power plant and sparked a fire.Emergency services in Ukraine said Friday that they had extinguished a fire at Europe's largest nuclear power plant after Kyiv blamed Russian military shelling for the blaze.

The White House has imposed new sanctions on 50 Russian oligarchs, including Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskovt, and their families in the latest attempt to target President Vladimir Putin for ordering the invasion of Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Moscow Friday of resorting to ""nuclear terror"" and wanting to ""repeat"" the Chernobyl disaster after he said invading Russian forces attacked a nuclear power plant.

US President Joe Biden on Thursday urged Russia to stop its military activities at a Ukrainian nuclear power plant and to allow in emergency services.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said on Twitter that it’s been informed by Ukraine’s nuclear regulator that “there has been no change reported in radiation levels” at a nuclear power station shelled by Russian troops.

Russian forces pressed their attack on a crucial energy-producing city by shelling Europe’s largest nuclear plant early Friday, sparking a fire and raising fears that radiation could leak from the damaged power station.

Plant spokesman Andriy Tuz told Ukrainian television that shells were falling directly on the Zaporizhzhia plant in the city of Enerhodar and had set fire to one of the facility’s six reactors. That reactor is under renovation and not operating, but there is nuclear fuel inside, he said.

A government official told The Associated Press that elevated levels of radiation were detected near the plant, which provides about 25% of Ukraine’s power generation. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the information has not yet been publicly released.

Tuz said firefighters cannot get near the flames because they are being shot at. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted a plea to the Russians to stop the assault and allow fire teams inside.

“We demand that they stop the heavy weapons fire,” Tuz said in a video statement. “There is a real threat of nuclear danger in the biggest atomic energy station in Europe.”

The attack renewed fears that the invasion could result in damage to one of Ukraine’s 15 nuclear reactors and trigger another emergency like the 1986 Chernobyl accident, the world’s worst nuclear disaster, which happened about 110 kilometers (65 miles) north of the capital.

At least 22 people were killed on Thursday in the wake of Russian air strikes in Ukraine's Chernihiv region, the Ukrainian emergency services said in an online post.

It said rescue work was ongoing, without specifying where exactly the attack took place. Earlier the regional governor said at least nine people had been killed by an air strike on two schools and private houses.

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky called on the West on Thursday to increase military aid to Ukraine, saying Russia would advance on the rest of Europe otherwise.

""If you do not have the power to close the skies, then give me planes!"" Zelensky told a press conference. ""If we are no more then, God forbid, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia will be next,"" he said, adding: ""Believe me.""

He called for direct talks with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, saying it was ""the only way to stop this war.""

""We are not attacking Russia and we do not plan to attack it. What do you want from us? Leave our land,"" he said, addressing Putin.

""Sit down with me. Just not 30 metres away like with (French President Emmanuel Macron),"" the Ukrainian leader said, referring to Putin receiving world leaders at a now famous enormously long table.

Zelensky - who just weeks ago sought to calm Ukrainians over US allegations that Russia was planning to invade his country -- said: ""Nobody thought that in the modern world a man can behave like a beast.""

Kyiv said more than 350 civilians have been killed since Putin launched the invasion.

A week into the war, Ukraine claimed that more than 2,000 of its civilians had been killed during the first week of the Russian invasion, while Moscow announced that it had so far lost 498 soldiers in the war – the first time it has given a figure.

Ukraine’s military maintains that around 6,000 Russians have been killed since the fighting began, while its emergency services say transport facilities, hospitals, kindergartens and homes have been destroyed.

Urban centres are increasingly under attack, with Russian shelling targeting several cities including Kharkiv, Kherson and Mariupol. There were also reports of explosions in Kyiv last night, including a huge blast at the capital’s main railway station.

With the Kremlin pouring more and more forces into the conflict, and a steady ratcheting up of air and artillery strikes, Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky said Vladimir Putin was giving orders “to erase us all, erase our country, erase our history”.

Adding to the sense of growing chaos and a looming humanitarian disaster in the heart of Europe, the UN reported that more than 874,000 people had now fled Ukraine since the invasion began.

Kharkiv has been turned into a desolate landscape of smashed and burning buildings and gouged roads after days of fighting, as Russian forces, led by paratroopers, pushed deeper into the centre with repeated air strikes on the defending Ukrainian soldiers.

The 1.5 million inhabitants of the city, which was meant to become the centre of Ukraine’s new Silicon Valley, have either fled or are seeking refuge in shelters amid the bombardment.

The city’s mayor, Ihor Terekhov, said in an online video statement that Russia’s actions amounted to “genocide”.

“Kharkiv is a Russian-speaking city. Every fourth person in Kharkiv has relatives in the Russian Federation. We never expected this could happen: total destruction, annihilation, genocide against the Ukrainian people – this is unforgivable.”

Two port cities, Kherson and Mariupol, have faced intense attacks. Russia on Wednesday night claimed - as it did on Tuesday - that it had seized Kherson, saying that Vladimir Putin’s troops were in “complete control” of the city.

However, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky’s office said late in the evening that fighting was still ongoing. Kherson’s mayor, Igor Kolykhayev, revealed that Russian troops were on the street and had forced their way into the city council building.

After meeting with armed troops, Mr Kolykhayev announced several conditions that would allow the city to remain, at least ostensibly, under Ukraine control - including a curfew and residents only being allowed in the company of one other person outside.

He said in a post on Facebook: “Ukrainian flag above us. And to keep it the same, these requirements must be met. I have nothing else to offer yet.”

The Ukrainian military earlier said they were expecting amphibious landings by enemy forces along the Black Sea coast in Odesa and Zatoka.

According to the Ukrainian authorities, there were also attempts by the Russians to capture Chernihiv, lying between Kyiv and the border with Belarus, along one of the main routes being taken by Moscow’s forces heading towards the capital. A number of administrative buildings, along with water and electricity supply facilities, were damaged by rocket fire.

Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, added to an apocalyptic vision of the future by warning that a third world war would mean the use of nuclear weapons. President Putin has placed his country’s nuclear force on a state of high alert.

The conflict has led the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to express grave concerns over safety following fighting around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.

The Russian government told the IAEA that its forces had taken control of the facility, the workforce had returned, and radiation levels “remain normal”.

Zaporizhzhia is Europe’s largest nuclear power plant and is the base for six of Ukraine’s 15 nuclear energy reactors. Local people have been building roadblocks in the area to try to block Russian troops for two days.

As the fighting continues, a second round of ceasefire negotiations is due to take place between Russia and Ukraine near the Belarus border. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: “In the second half of the day, closer to evening, our delegation will be in place to await Ukrainian negotiators.”

Mr Peskov refused to reveal the location of the meeting. There is little optimism that the negotiations will lead to an end to hostilities, after it was reported that no common ground had been reached at the first round of talks on Monday.

The Kremlin’s offers of peace talks were viewed as risible by many of those on the receiving end of Russian shelling.

In Kharkiv, Viktoria Burick, a 22-year-old student, told The Independent: “It is a joke, a very sick joke. How can they even speak of peace when they are bombing us day and night, ordinary people are getting killed and injured?

“My grandmother, she is 68, has had to live underground for the last two days in a shelter. There is no heating, no food, no water. My little brother and sister are terrified. I don’t believe Russians want peace at all, they are trying to fool the world.”

The mayor of Mariupol, Vadym Boichenko, spoke of the possibility of mass casualties after Russian troops blocked exit routes while continuing to attack.

“They are flattening us non-stop for 12 hours now. The enemy occupying forces of the Russian Federation have done everything to block the exit of civilians from the city of half a million people,” he said.

“We cannot even take the wounded from the streets, from houses and apartments today, since the shelling does not stop.

“Our railway link has been cut – they even went to the railway station and fired on our diesel locomotives so that people can’t be evacuated. So their mission is to destroy us; they have no intention of helping civilians.”

Meanwhile, the crackdown on dissent about the war continued in Russia, with independent media outlets being shut down. A group of primary school children were reported to have been arrested after holding up signs saying “No to war”.

Photographs appeared of the children with police officers behind the metal bars of a police van, and then at a police station. Novaya Gazeta, the Nobel Prize-winning newspaper, later reported that the children had been released.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ukraine-civilians-kyiv-kharkiv-death-toll-b2027141.html

Moscow has denied the use of the weapons, which detonate in mid-air and release smaller “bomblets” in order to hit multiple targets over a large area.

“We have seen the use of cluster bombs and we have seen reports of other types of weapons which would be in violation of international law,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels on Friday. “This is brutality. This is inhumane.”

Moscow has claimed it is only attacking military targets, but there have been multiple reports of blasts in residential areas in Kyiv and elsewhere in the country. The northern city of Chernihiv was shelled Thursday, with at least 33 civilians killed and 18 more wounded in a residential area. Unconfirmed reports indicate the carnage was caused by cluster munitions.

Human rights groups have also claimed cluster bombs were used this week to shell Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, in attacks that killed at least three people.

“Using cluster munitions in populated areas shows a brazen and callous disregard for people’s lives,” Human Rights Watch arms director Steve Goose said in a statement Friday.

“We are seeing mounting evidence of indiscriminate attacks on Kharkiv and the price civilians are paying for these serious violations,” he added. “If these deadly acts were carried out either intentionally or recklessly, they would be war crimes.”

The projectiles emitted by cluster bombs often don’t explode right away, but can go off at any time after landing, according to the Associated Press.

Russia has also been accused of using “vacuum bombs,” oxygen-fueled weapons that generate a blast wave and create a partial vacuum in an enclosed space. The weapons may have been utilized by Russia in a “bunker buster” role to wreak havoc on underground Ukrainian infrastructure.

Officers collected hundreds of RBK-250 “cluster bombs” in Zatoka, Ukraine, according to Ukrainian media. Security Service of Ukraine

Although the Biden administration hasn’t confirmed the use of the weapons by Russia, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said international organizations would look into whether they were unleashed.

“If that were true, it would potentially be a war crime,” she told reporters Monday.
