Mariupol mayor Vadym Boichenko said that among the thousands of civilians killed during weeks of Russian airstrikes and street fighting, 210 were children.

He claimed Russian forces bombed hospitals, including one in which 50 people burned to death, and added that more than 9 per cent of the city’s infrastructure has now been completely destroyed.

The city has been encircled by Russian forces for more than a month and has been cut off from food, water, fuel and medicine supplies.

Almost 160,000 people remained trapped in the city, which had a pre-war population of 430,000, according to British defence officials.

A humanitarian-relief convoy accompanied by the Red Cross has been trying without success to get into the city since Friday.

In other developments, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky warned that Moscow is now marshalling reinforcements and trying to push deeper into the country’s east.

“The fate of our land and of our people is being decided. We know what we are fighting for. And we will do everything to win,” Mr Zelensky said.

His comments came after a US defence official said that Russian forces had completed the pullout of all of its estimated 24,000 or more troops from the Kyiv and Chernihiv areas in the north of the country.

The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they were being sent into Belarus or Russia to resupply and reorganise.

In response to the scenes of atrocities that were revealed when Russian forces left the town of Bucha, northwest of the capital, Kyiv, last week, the US and Western allies have imposed yet further sanctions against the Kremlin.

✕ Biden vows to 'ratchet up the pain' on Putin to increase economic isolation

The UK government put an asset freeze on Russia’s largest bank Sberbank and an “outright ban” on outward investment to the country, worth £11 billion in 2020.

Meanwhile, US president Joe Biden signed an executive order directly targeting Mr Putin and foreign minister Sergei Lavrov’s families, and also blocked further new investment in Russia.

“There’s nothing less happening than major war crimes,” Mr Biden said in a speech to labour leaders, referring to the Ukrainian town of Bucha retaken from Russian forces where civilians were found shot at close range.

“Responsible nations have to come together to hold these perpetrators accountable,” he said. “And together with our allies and our partners, we’re going to keep raising economic costs and ratchet up the pain for Putin.”

Moscow has insisted its troops have committed no war crimes and said that the images out of Bucha were staged by the Ukrainians.

Human Rights Council The U.S. and other countries have submitted a draft resolution to suspend Russia from the United Nations’ Human Rights Council. The U.N. General Assembly emergency session is scheduled to resume at 10 a.m. Thursday. The draft resolution lists reports of “gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights” and “violations of international humanitarian law” after Russia invaded Ukraine. The U.S., the European Union, the United Kingdom and Canada were among the countries seeking consideration of the resolution. The U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Linda Thomas-Greenfield, in an address in Romania cited the images out of Bucha, Ukraine, in calling for Russia to be suspended from the Human Rights Council. “We see every day, including yesterday, heartbreaking reports about how little they care about human rights. Russia’s participation on the Human Rights Council is a farce,"" she said. Photos and video of bodies in Bucha, near Kyiv, left after Russian forces withdrew have been met with shock and outrage, and they have renewed accusations that Russian forces have committed war crimes.

House passes bill that calls for report on war crimes in Ukraine WASHINGTON — The House overwhelmingly passed legislation Wednesday calling for a federal government report on evidence of war crimes committed during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Lawmakers backed the measure amid gruesome reports of atrocities in towns around Kyiv, particularly Bucha, and new accounts of the civilian death toll in the besieged port city of Mariupol. The legislation calls for the president to submit a report to Congress about efforts to preserve evidence related to war crimes. The Senate passed a resolution last month seeking an investigation of Russian President Vladimir Putin for war crimes. In his daily nighttime video address to the nation late Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of trying to hide evidence of war crimes to interfere with the international investigation.

""It is their efforts to hide the evidence, nothing more. But they will not succeed, because they killed a lot of people.” Zelenskyy claims Russia hiding evidence of killing Ukraine civilians April 7, 2022 01:32 The video did not expand on the information.

West hits Russia on multiple fronts, but questions over gas reliance remain After what many consider a sluggish start, the West is now hitting Russia in a multipronged assault: NATO members are meeting in Europe on Wednesday to discuss more sanctions, diplomatic expulsions and kicking Russia out of a United Nations body. The push comes after the discovery of atrocities in the Ukrainian town of Bucha apparently committed by withdrawing Russian troops — something President Joe Biden and other world leaders have labeled a war crime. Despite this full-court press by the West, the real test will be whether Europe can wean itself off Russian gas. The European Union’s foreign policy chief revealed Wednesday that the bloc had paid 35 billion euros (around $38 billion) for Russian energy since the invasion began — compared with 1 billion euros in aid for Ukraine — indirectly financing the Kremlin’s war machine. “It’s been a belated effort; countries were far too weak as Putin was ratcheting up his war,” said Scott Lucas, a professor at England’s University of Birmingham who specializes in foreign affairs. “But now they’ve got it together, they are adding political and economic pressure to add to Russia’s military defeat.” Read the full story here.

U.S. using intel to fight info war with Russia, even when intel isn’t rock solid It was an attention-grabbing assertion that made headlines around the world: U.S. officials said they had intelligence suggesting Russia might be preparing to use chemical agents in Ukraine.

The official said the sweeping package ""will impose significant costs on Russia and send it further down the road of economic, financial, and technological isolation.""

The new sanctions package will:

Ban all new investment in Russia

Increase sanctions on financial institutions and state-owned enterprises in Russia

Sanction Russian government officials and their family members

The new sanctions package will mark the latest escalation in efforts by the US and its allies to impose costs on Russia for its invasion and, over time, cut off critical economic sectors the country utilizes to wage the ongoing war.

They also follow new revelations of further atrocities committed by Russian forces in northern Ukraine, with the images of the atrocities committed in Bucha serving as an accelerator to ongoing discussions between the US and its European allies to ramp up the economic costs, officials said.

""These measures will degrade key instruments of Russian state power, impose acute and immediate economic harm on Russia, and hold accountable the Russian kleptocracy that funds and supports Putin's war,"" the official said. ""These measures will be taken in lockstep with our allies and partners, demonstrating our resolve and unity in imposing unprecedented costs on Russia for its war against Ukraine.""

The official added, ""We had already concluded that Russia committed war crimes in Ukraine, and the information from Bucha appears to show further evidence of war crimes. And as the President said, we will work with the world to ensure there is full accountability for these crimes. One of those tools is sanctions — and we have been working intensively with our European allies on further sanctions.""

More context: The expected sanctions come after the US Treasury announced it will no longer allow Russia to pay down its debt using dollars stockpiled at American banks. While Washington had imposed sanctions on the Russian Central Bank freezing their foreign currency at US banks, the Treasury Department had previously allowed Russia to use those reserves to repay its debt.

It's a move that officials say will substantially raise the risk of default and undercut urgent efforts by the central bank to stanch the economic bleeding that immediately arrested the Russian economy in the wake of the Western response to the invasion.

In a video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for an end to Russian “war crimes.”

His address came after reports of dozens of bodies found in the streets and mass graves in the Ukrainian city of Bucha.

“The world has already seen many war crimes. At different times. On different continents. But it is time to do everything possible to make the war crimes of the Russian military the last manifestation of such evil on earth,” Zelensky said.

Zelensky called on Russian leaders to be held accountable for the actions of the nation's military.

“I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being fulfilled. Such orders. Such a fulfillment. And joint responsibility. For these murders, for these tortures, for these arms torn off by explosions that lie on the streets. For shots in the back of the head of tied people. This is how the Russian state will now be perceived. This is your image,” Zelensky said.

In his address, Zelensky announced a “mechanism of justice” would be established to investigate crimes committed by Russian soldiers in Ukrainian territory. The mechanism would be supported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Office of the Prosecutor General, the National Police, the Security Service, the Intelligence Service and other government branches, he said.

“This mechanism will help Ukraine and the world bring to concrete justice those who unleashed or in any way participated in this terrible war against the Ukrainian people and in crimes against our people,” he said.

Zelensky said he will provide more information on the state of Ukrainian territory that was occupied by Russian forces.

“All partners of Ukraine will be informed in detail about what happened in the temporarily occupied territory of our state. War crimes in Bucha and other cities during the Russian occupation will also be considered by the UN Security Council on Tuesday,” he said.

He also noted efforts are underway to restore electricity and water to Bucha, as well as reestablishing medical institutions and infrastructure.

Zelensky once again invoked the need for stronger sanctions against Russia.

“There will definitely be a new package of sanctions against Russia. But I'm sure that's not enough. More conclusions are needed. Not only about Russia, but also about the political behavior that actually allowed this evil to come to our land,” he said.",https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-04-04-22/h_14cefcb130fc0e172a7a501d15d2f582?fbclid=IwAR2Pfn9PMSuwTw_kFTt3-WxYdycUcF437xSUywjQjzYs_tUPjI9t4wk1rgU
