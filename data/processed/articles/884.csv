GENEVA, April 5 (Reuters) - Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said in a statement on Tuesday that its team witnessed Russian strikes during a hospital visit on April 4 in Mykolaiv, Ukraine and managed to take cover and escape unharmed.

""Several explosions took place in close proximity to our staff over the course of about 10 minutes,"" said Michel-Olivier Lacharité, MSF head of mission in Ukraine. ""As they were leaving the area, the MSF team saw injured people and at least one dead body.""

The Geneva-based MSF did not give details on how it knew the strikes were Russian and did not provide evidence beyond the statement. Reuters has not been able to verify the details of what happened.

Russia denies targeting civilians since launching what it calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine on Feb. 24 to demilitarise and ""denazify"" its neighbor.

The windows of the team's vehicle parked outside the hospital were blown out by the blasts, MSF said. The facility, a cancer hospital also treating war-wounded, is located in a residential area in eastern Mykolaiv with many medical facilities, it said.

""Bombing such a large area within a residential neighbourhood in the middle of the afternoon cannot but cause civilian casualties and hit public buildings,"" said Lacharité.

The MSF team of four saw numerous small holes in the ground scattered over a large area after the strikes, saying these ""could be consistent with the use of cluster bombs"", the statement said.

A spokesperson for the Russian mission to the United Nations in Geneva declined to give an immediate comment.

The U.N. rights team has previously said it has received ""credible reports"" of several cases of Russian forces using cluster munitions - bombs with a hollow shell that explode in mid-air - in populated areas in Ukraine. read more

A WHO database shows that there have been 89 attacks on health infrastructure since Russia's invasion began on Feb. 24, without indicating who was responsible.

At least 11 people were killed and 61 wounded in a rocket attack on Mykolaiv on Monday that hit a bus stop and shopping area, Ukrainian human rights ombudswoman Lyudmyla Denisova said on Tuesday.

Last week, a missile blasted a hole in the side of a government building in Mykolaiv, killing dozens. On Sunday, deadly strikes injured a 15-year-old, among several others. On Monday, at least 11 people were killed and 61 wounded in attacks, the regional governor said.

Shelling in the city has continued nearly every day for weeks, but civilian infrastructure and homes have increasingly been targeted, local officials and soldiers say. Russian forces have struck residential buildings, a hospital, an orphanage and schools in recent days, Oleksandr Senkevych, the mayor of Mykolaiv, said.

The assault on the city and others in Ukraine’s south comes as Russian forces refocus after withdrawing from positions in the north and northeast.

The security footage from Monday shows a handful of ambulances parked in Mykolaiv Oblast — with a sudden blast hitting the left side of a yellow one nearest the camera.

As the area flashes in flames, the emergency vehicle shudders and its doors swing open from the impact as smoke envelops the area.

Mykolaiv Oblast Gov. Vitaliy Kim posted the video to Facebook, writing that the “attack on a secret medical facility was a children’s hospital.”

The comment was a sarcastic reference to Russia’s previous claims that other blown-up medical targets — including a maternity hospital in Mariupol — were secretly housing neo-Nazi troops, not the pregnant patients left blood-soaked and terrified.

The head of the Mykolaiv Regional Council, Anna Zamazeeva, had said that two people — a man and a child — died during Monday’s strike at the children’s hospital.

They were among nine killed in the area that day, with 61 others injured, she said, calling it “another horrible day” in a “war without rules.”

The medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said it had a four-person team there at the time — and their vehicle was one of those that had its windows “blown out by the blasts.”

Smoke covers the ambulance and surrounding area. Storyful

A cancer hospital that has also been treating those wounded in the war was also hit, along with the neighboring kids’ hospital, according to MSF — which said the damage “could be consistent with the use of cluster bombs.”

“Several explosions took place in close proximity to our staff over the course of about 10 minutes,” Michel-Olivier Lacharité, MSF head of mission in Ukraine, said in a statement.

“As they were leaving the area, the MSF team saw injured people and at least one dead body,” he said, noting the charity’s staffers all sought cover and survived.

“Bombing such a large area within a residential neighborhood in the middle of the afternoon cannot but cause civilian casualties and hit public buildings,” says Lacharité, adding at least three hospitals had been hit in just two days.

In a letter to Biden on Tuesday shared with CNN, Sen. Ed Markey and Rep. Bill Keating, both of Massachusetts, expressed concern that Russia could lash out with further cyberattacks in Ukraine or with hacking that tests NATO’s resolve as Russian military progress in Ukraine stalls.

A cyberattack last week on Ukrtelecom, which describes itself as Ukraine’s largest “fixed line” internet and phone provider, that reportedly knocked connectivity down at the telecom operator to 13% of its pre-war levels.

The lawmakers, both members of their respective chamber’s foreign affairs committees, want a newly formed cybersecurity bureau at the State Department to bolster US cooperation with Ukraine and European allies on cybersecurity issues, and in turn help defend against Russian hacking threats.

A spokesperson for Markey’s office called the $37 million the White House requested from Congress to run the bureau in fiscal 2023 a “strong starting point,” but said that it was “imperative” that the State Department coordinate with government entities like the US Cyber Command and the Department of Homeland Security that have long provided cybersecurity assistance to Ukraine.

CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.

Separate from the new bureau, the State Department has overseen millions of dollars in aid to Kyiv to shore up its networks in recent years. And the head of US Cyber Command, the military’s hacking unit, said Tuesday that the command dispatched a team of cyber specialists to Ukraine late last year to help defend Ukrainian infrastructure.

More on the hacks: While there have been an array of Russia-linked hacking incidents against Ukrainian organizations since the war began, there haven’t been the level of disruptive hacks against critical infrastructure that some analysts feared.

One exception was a cyberattack at the onset of the war that knocked out internet service for tens of thousands of satellite modems in Ukraine and elsewhere in Europe. US officials are investigating that incident as a potential state-sponsored Russian hack, CNN previously reported.

On March 21, Biden warned US business executives that “the magnitude of Russia's cyber capacity is fairly consequential and it's coming."" So far, no consequential hacks on US organizations publicly attributed to the Russian government have emerged. But US officials continue to prepare for the possibility.

Markey and Keating asked Biden to “promptly” nominate an ambassador-at-large to lead the State Department’s new cybersecurity bureau. (Secretary of State Antony Blinken told State Department employees Monday that Biden would nominate someone for the role “very soon.”)

The Democratic lawmakers also want to know what lessons the Biden administration have learned from Russian hacking in Ukraine in recent weeks.

“How is the Administration coordinating U.S. government agencies to apply these lessons to shore up potential U.S. vulnerabilities as well as those of our allies and partners?” Markey and Keating wrote to Biden, asking for answers by April 29.",https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-04-05-22/h_fbb58955b0c1adf5c994dbf3990ea659

The four-person MSF team visited Mykolaiv on Monday to meet with city and regional health authorities and visit the city’s oncology hospital. At around 3:30 p.m. local time, the area around the hospital came under fire, according to the Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) statement released Tuesday.

""Several explosions took place in close proximity to our staff over the course of about 10 minutes,” said Michel-Olivier Lacharité, MSF head of mission in Ukraine, currently based in Odesa.

“As they were leaving the area, the MSF team saw injured people and at least one dead body. However, we are not in a position to give exact numbers of dead and injured,"" Lacharité said in the statement.

""Fortunately our staff were able to take cover and were not hurt in the explosions, although the windows of their vehicle, parked outside the hospital entrance, were blown out by the blasts,” the statement said.

MSF also said the region's pediatric hospital was also hit by the blasts. No large crater was visible, according to MSF, but their team described numerous small holes in the ground throughout a large area.

""Bombing such a large area within a residential neighborhood in the middle of the afternoon cannot but cause civilian casualties and hit public buildings,"" Lacharité added. ""Hospitals, patients, and medical staff must absolutely be spared from attack.”
