WARSAW, Poland (AP) — The Pentagon on Tuesday rejected Poland’s surprise announcement that it would give the United States its MiG-29 fighter jets for use by Ukraine, a rare display of disharmony by NATO allies seeking to boost Ukrainian fighters while avoiding getting caught up in a wider war with Russia.

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Poland’s declaration that it intended to deliver the 28 jets to the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany raised the concerning prospect of warplanes departing from a U.S. and NATO base to fly into airspace contested with Russia in the Ukraine conflict.

“We will continue to consult with Poland and our other NATO allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland’s proposal is a tenable one,” Kirby said in a statement.

The proposed gift of more warplanes would be a morale booster for Ukrainians under pounding Russian assault for nearly two weeks. But it also raises the risk of the war expanding beyond Ukraine.

Russia has declared that supporting Ukraine’s air force would be tantamount to joining the war, and could spur retaliation.

White House officials were blindsided by the Polish announcement on the MiGs. The proposal did not come up during talks with Secretary of State Antony Blinken when he was recently in Poland, according to a U.S. official familiar with the talks.

The U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said White House officials did not think the proposal would easily solve the logistical challenges of providing aircraft to Ukraine.

U.S. Undersecretary of State Victoria Nuland told lawmakers at a hearing on the Ukraine crisis Tuesday she learned of Poland’s plans only while driving to the hearing.

“To my knowledge, it wasn’t pre-consulted with us,” Nuland told senators.

Ukraine has been pleading for more warplanes as it resists mightier Russian forces. Washington has been looking at a proposal under which Poland would supply Ukraine with the MiG-29s and in turn receive American F-16s to make up for their loss. Ukrainian pilots are trained to fly the Soviet-era fighter jets.

The Polish Foreign Ministry announced the plan in a statement, which said the jets would be delivered to Ramstein free of charge.

“At the same time, Poland requests the United States to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities,” it said.

The Polish government also appealed to other owners of MIG-29 jets to follow suit.

Former Soviet-bloc NATO members Bulgaria and Slovakia also still have Soviet-made fighter jets in their air forces.

Poland publicly floated its plan the day before Vice President Kamala Harris is scheduled to depart for Warsaw for talks with Polish officials. The disconnect is likely to add an awkward layer to the talks, which were expected to focus largely on U.S. efforts to help Poland and other eastern European nations that have taken in some 2 million refugees since the war started.

Additional air-defense capabilities are the No. 1 priority for Ukraine’s military right now, the country’s defense attache in Washington, Maj. Gen. Borys Kremenetskyi, told The Associated Press on Tuesday after returning from a meeting at the Pentagon. “It can be ground-based air-defense systems. It can be fighter jets, whatever possible,” he said.

Ukraine also needs additional anti-tank, anti-armor weapons and coastal defense capabilities to defend against Russian ships in the south, he said.

The handover of Poland’s 28 Soviet-made MiG-29s would signal Western resolve to do more for Ukraine. Militarily, however, the number of planes offered would make it unlikely to be a game-changer. And MiG-29s are inferior to more sophisticated Russian aircraft and could be easy prey for Russian pilots and Russian missiles.

A senior U.S. defense official has said Ukrainians are flying relatively few of their existing aircraft, for relatively little time, as it is. The defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the U.S. assessment, said it’s possible that Ukraine does not need more planes and would benefit most from more of the weapons it uses effectively every day, including anti-aircraft Stinger and anti-tank Javelin missiles.

The official also said that Russia currently has the capacity to reach almost the entire country of Ukraine with its surface-to-air missiles, including from within Russia and from ships in the Black Sea.

Any MiG transfer is fraught with complications. Neither NATO nor the European Union wants to be seen as directly involved in such a transaction, which would sharply raise already extreme tensions with Russia.

In order to maintain the pretense that NATO and the EU are not direct participants in the Ukraine conflict, U.S. and Polish officials have been considering a variety of options. One begins with the “donation” of Poland’s MiGs to the United States, as Poland announced on Tuesday.

Under one scenario, Poland would deliver the fighter jets to the U.S. base in Germany, where they would be repainted and flown to a non-NATO, non-EU country. Ukrainian pilots would then come to fly them to Ukraine.

No country has been publicly identified as a transit point, but Kosovo, a non-aligned country that is very friendly with the United States, has been mentioned as one of several nations that might be willing to serve as a middle point.

Poland’s proposed gift would also weaken Poland’s own air force at a time of heightened danger in eastern Europe.

Poland had been asking for the U.S. to provide it with F-16 fighter jets to replace the MiGs.

F-16 production is backlogged, however, and the next recipient in line for new deliveries is Taiwan, which is facing renewed threats from China and has strong support from both parties in Congress.

In its statement, the Polish government specifically asked for “used” planes, a distinction that would allow the Biden administration to bypass congressional opposition to making Taiwan wait to receive its F-16s.

Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said any decision about delivering offensive weapons must be made unanimously by NATO members.

“This is why we are able to give all of our fleet of jet fighters to Ramstein. But we are not ready to make any moves on our own because ... we are not a party to this war,” he said.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday that he believed the aid that Congress hopes to approve later this week for Ukraine will include loan guarantees to help NATO allies replenish their air forces after giving MiGs to Ukraine.

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby released a statement Tuesday evening calling the proposal untenable.

Poland proposed a plan Tuesday to transfer the jets to the Ramstein Air Base to then go to Ukraine to help their fight against Russia.

“The prospect of fighter jets ‘at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America’ departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,” Kirby said.

“It is simply not clear to us that there is a substantive rationale for it. We will continue to consult with Poland and our other NATO allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland’s proposal is a tenable one,” he added.

Poland’s plan came after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky pleaded with the U.S. to transfer the MiG-29 jets to the country on Saturday.

In Poland’s statement Tuesday, it called on other NATO allies with those types of jets, which Ukrainian soldiers are trained to use, to transfer them to Ukraine.

Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland said the offer by Poland was not “preconsulted” with the U.S.

“We are now in contact with the Polish government following the statement issued today. As we have said, the decision about whether to transfer Polish-owned planes to Ukraine is ultimately one for the Polish government,” Kirby said. “We will continue consulting with our Allies and partners about our ongoing security assistance to Ukraine, because, in fact, Poland’s proposal shows just some of the complexities this issue presents.”

The latest: Pentagon press secretary John Kirby issued a statement Tuesday evening indicating that the Polish government had not consulted with the U.S. prior to its announcement.

What they're saying: ""The prospect of fighter jets 'at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America' departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,"" Kirby said.

""It is simply not clear to us that there is a substantive rationale for it,"" he added, stressing that the proposal ""shows just some of the complexities this issue presents.""

""We will continue to consult with Poland and our other NATO allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland's proposal is a tenable one.""

Why it matters: Ukraine has pleaded with the Western allies to either impose a ""no-fly"" zone or hand over warplanes that Ukrainian pilots could use to counter Russia's aerial assault.

Zoom in: Under one option being considered by the Biden administration, the U.S. would backfill Poland's MiG-29 fleet with American-made F-16 fighter jets.

The U.S. and Poland had downplayed the chances of such a deal as recently as Monday, warning of major logistics issues and the risk of provoking Russia.

That suddenly appeared to change on Tuesday, when Poland said it would send the MiGs to the U.S. in exchange for ""used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities.""

Poland also called on other eastern-flank NATO allies in possession of MiGs — Bulgaria and Slovakia — to take similar steps.

Between the lines: After Poland's announcement, which appeared to shift responsibility for making the deal happen to the U.S., a top State Department official said the Biden administration was not consulted.

""To my knowledge, it wasn't pre-consulted with us that they planned to give these planes to us,"" Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland testified to the Senate.

Russia's Defense Ministry had warned on Sunday that any country that allows Ukrainian-operated airplanes to use their soil to attack the Russian military could be considered a participant in the conflict.

What to watch: The Biden administration is still facing bipartisan pressure from Congress to somehow facilitate the transfer of the jets to Ukraine.

In principle, the U.S. has said Poland has a ""green light"" to send the jets to Ukraine — but the logistical and political hurdles may be prove too difficult to surmount.

Washington appeared surprised by the announcement by Polish foreign minister, Zbigniew Rau, who said on Tuesday that his government was “ready to deploy – immediately and free of charge – all their MiG-29 jets to the Ramstein airbase and place them at the disposal of the government of the United States of America.”

The Pentagon appeared to reject the proposal, saying it was not “tenable”.

In a statement, the US Department of Defense said the prospect of the jets departing from the base in Germany “to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire Nato alliance”.

“We will continue to consult with Poland and our other Nato allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland’s proposal is a tenable one,” John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said.

The dispute came as Mikhail Mizintsev, the head of Russia’s National Defence Control Centre, said Russian forces would “observe a regime of silence” from 7am GMT to ensure safe passage for civilians wishing to leave Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol. It was unclear if the proposed routes would pass through Russia or Belarus, conditions previously opposed by the Ukrainian government.

Authorities in Kyiv have previously accused Moscow of shelling a similar refugee corridor meant to allow residents to escape the devastated port of Mariupol.

“The enemy has launched an attack heading exactly at the humanitarian corridor,” the Ukrainian defence ministry said on Facebook on Tuesday, adding that the Russian army “did not let children, women and elderly people leave the city”. The International Committee of the Red Cross said many Mariupol residents face an “apocalyptic” situation, with no water, power or heating.

Ukraine’s deputy prime minister said 5,000 civilians were successfully evacuated from the Sumy region on Tuesday, where 21 people had been killed in air strikes on Tuesday.

The Polish incident has exposed cracks in the Nato alliance which the Biden administration has struggled to keep in lockstep in the face of the Russian invasion. Vice President Kamala Harris is due to hold talks with the Polish government in Warsaw on Thursday where she will attempt to repair some of the diplomatic damage.The US said on Tuesday that it was deploying two of its Patriot antimissile batteries to Poland to help protect Nato troops and territory. The deployment is intended to provide a layer of protection against the Ukraine conflict spilling over the country’s western border.

“This defensive deployment is being conducted proactively to counter any potential threat to US and allied forces and Nato territory,” the US European Command said in a statement.

In other developments:

Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates reportedly declined to arrange calls with Joe Biden in recent weeks as the US seeks to increase oil supply after formally banning Russian oil imports on Tuesday, pushing oil prices to $130 a barrel, the highest level in 14 years.

Venezuela released at least two jailed US citizens on Tuesday, according to multiple sources, in an apparent goodwill gesture. It follows a visit to Caracas by a high-level US delegation that focused not only on the fate of Americans held in Venezuela, but on the possibility of easing US oil sanctions on the Opec member, which is a close Russian ally.

The Chernobyl nuclear power plant is no longer transmitting data to the UN’s atomic watchdog, the agency said, as it voiced “deep concern” for staff working under Russian guard at the captured Ukrainian facility. International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi voiced fears for nuclear safety and offered to travel to the site.

Foreign volunteers will qualify for Ukrainian citizenship, first deputy interior minister Yevhen Yenin said in a TV interview. Nearly 20,000 people from 52 countries have signed up to become volunteers in the war with Russia.

More western brands continued to suspend operations in Russia, with Starbucks, Coca-Cola and Pepsi joining McDonald’s in halting sales.

Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, warned Russia that any attack on supply lines in Nato countries carrying arms and ammunition to Ukraine would be grounds for retaliation. “An attack on Nato territory, on Nato forces, Nato capabilities, that would be an attack on Nato,” Stoltenberg said.

British foreign secretary Liz Truss will meet her US counterpart Antony Blinken in Washington on Wednesday to discuss what more can be done to help Ukraine and reduce energy dependency on Russia. Truss called the invasion of Ukraine “a wake-up call for free democracies”.

Poland is thought to have 28 of the Soviet-era MiG-29 warplanes, and had been in negotiation with the Biden administration on a three-way deal in which Warsaw would gave the planes to Ukraine, on condition that the US would provide the Polish air force with newer US fighters.

“Poland requests the United States to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities,” Rau said in a statement on his ministry’s website. “Poland is ready to immediately establish the conditions of purchase of the planes.”

Rau requested other Nato allies with MiG-29 jets – a reference to Slovakia and Bulgaria – “act in the same vein”.

By handing them to the US, Poland was hoping to mitigate the risk of direct retaliation from Russia.

However, the US under secretary of state for political affairs, Victoria Nuland, said the Polish announcement had taken Washington unawares, calling it a “surprise move by the Poles”.

“To my knowledge, it wasn’t pre-consulted with us that they plan to give these planes to us,” Nuland told Congress. “I look forward when this hearing is over to getting back to my desk and seeing how we will respond to this proposal of theirs to give the planes to us.”

The idea of donating old warplanes to Ukraine was raised on 27 February by the EU foreign and security policy chief, Josep Borrell, who declared: “We are going to provide even fighter jets.” That announcement annoyed Polish officials, who said Warsaw was not properly consulted over a move that could expose the country to risk.

The Russian defence ministry did not address the issue directly but warned that any country that provided air fields for Ukrainian warplanes that were later used against Russians would be considered by Moscow as being involved in the conflict. Polish thinking is that when the planes are delivered to Ukrainian pilots, they will be taking off from an air base in Germany as US assets.

Poland announced its plan as US officials said the war in Ukraine had reached a pivotal moment, with Russia sustaining severe losses but with Putin determined to press on.

“I think the next couple of days are going to be critical for both the humanitarian situation and also for the tide of this war,” Michael Carpenter, the US ambassador to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), told the Guardian.

US intelligence agencies told Congress on Tuesday that they tentatively estimated that 2,000 to 4,000 Russian soldiers had been killed so far, but that Putin would persevere in the face of fierce Ukrainian resistance.

“We assess Putin feels aggrieved the west does not give him proper deference and perceives this as a war he cannot afford to lose,” the US director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, told the House intelligence committee.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/poland-mig-29-jets-us-ukraine

The Department of Defense on Tuesday rejected an offer from Poland, a fellow NATO member, to send fighter jets to a US air base to send to Ukraine for use against Russian forces.

For weeks President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called on the US and other NATO nations to provide Ukraine with warplanes so it can defend itself from Russian attacks.

However, the US and NATO have refrained from doing so, fearing the move would escalate tensions with Russia and stoke a wider conflict.

On Tuesday, Poland's foreign ministry offered to send all of its Russian-made MiG-29 fighter jets to the US Air Force's Ramstein Air Base in Germany, so they could be sent on to Ukraine's forces.

""The Polish Government also requests other NATO Allies — owners of MIG-29 jets — to act in the same vein,"" it said.

But the Pentagon rejected the offer later that day, with spokesman John Kirby tweeting that the prospect of US-linked fighter jets ""departing from a US/NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance.""

""It is simply not clear to us that there is a substantive rationale for it,"" Kirby said.

""We will continue to consult with Poland and our other NATO allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland's proposal is a tenable one.""

In a speech Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked Poland for offering the planes, but criticized the US for sending mixed signals.

""Russia uses missiles, aircraft, helicopters against us, against civilians, against our cities, against our infrastructure. This is the world's humanitarian duty to respond. But ... There is no decision,"" he said.

""So when will the decision be made? Listen: We have a war! We do not have time for all these signals. This is not ping pong! This is about human lives! We ask once again: solve it faster. Do not shift the responsibility, send us planes.""

Though the Pentagon declined to support the Polish plan on Tuesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has previously suggested it was in favor of the general transfer of Polish jets to Ukraine.

""That gets a green light, in fact we're talking with our Polish friends right now about what we might be able to do to backfill their needs if in fact they chose to provide these fighter jets to the Ukrainians,"" Blinken told CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday.

""What can we do, how can we help to make sure they get something to backfill the planes that they're handing over to the Ukrainians.""

Kirby said on Tuesday it was up to Polish officials if they wanted to send their own jets to Ukraine directly.

""The decision about whether to transfer Polish-owned planes to Ukraine is ultimately one for the Polish government,"" he said.

It also appears that Poland's offer caught the US by surprise.

""It wasn't pre-consulted with us that they planned to give these planes to us,"" Victoria Nuland, the State Department Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs, told a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Tuesday, Reuters reported.

""We will continue to consult with Poland and our other NATO allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland’s proposal is a tenable one.""

Poland's foreign ministry announced on Tuesday that it was ready to deploy its MiG-29 jets to Ramstein Air Base in Germany and put them at the disposal of the United States. It urged other members of the alliance that had other such aircraft to do the same.

The U.S. State Department's No. 3 diplomat said the Polish proposal caught the United States by surprise.

""To my knowledge, it wasn't pre-consulted with us that they planned to give these planes to us,"" State Department Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland told a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing.

""So I think that actually was a surprise move by the Poles,"" she said.

The impasse raises questions about the viability of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy plea for European countries to provide Russian-made planes, an issue he underscored during a video call Saturday with U.S. lawmakers.

U.S. lawmakers are eager to speed military aid to Ukraine and are pushing the Biden administration to facilitate the aircraft transfer.

But Poland's announcement could also reflect its own sensitivities.

Poland is supporting Ukraine with defensive weapons, but has said it would not send jets as it is not a direct party to the conflict between Ukraine - which is not a NATO ally - and Russia.

Russia's defense ministry warned this week that countries offering air fields to Ukraine for attacks on Russia may be considered as having entered the conflict.

Nuland said the main issue was to assess what Poland's immediate needs would be given it is adjacent to the conflict.

""Poland - they benefit from full air security from the NATO alliance. ... The main issue is to evaluate what Poland's immediate needs are in the context of being a neighbor of this conflict,"" she said.

Separately, the U.S. military announced it would reposition two Patriot missile batteries to Poland to proactively ""counter any potential threat to U.S. and Allied forces and NATO territory.""
