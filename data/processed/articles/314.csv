An analysis of satellite images by The New York Times rebuts claims by Russia that the killing of civilians in Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv, occurred after its soldiers had left the town.

When images emerged over the weekend of the bodies of dead civilians lying on the streets of Bucha — some with their hands bound, some with gunshot wounds to the head — Russia’s Ministry of Defense denied responsibility. In a Telegram post on Sunday, the ministry suggested that the bodies had been recently placed on the streets after “all Russian units withdrew completely from Bucha” around March 30.

Russia claimed that the images were “another hoax” and called for an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting on what it called “provocations of Ukrainian radicals” in Bucha.

But a review of videos and satellite imagery by The Times shows that many of the civilians were killed more than three weeks ago, when Russia’s military was in control of the town.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/04/world/europe/bucha-ukraine-bodies.html

Or the reality of seeing them up close in widely circulated photographs and videos.

There have been other atrocities in the weeks since Russia invaded Ukraine, concentrating much of its firepower on the dwellings and gathering spots of ordinary Ukrainians, but the international outrage they provoked has been eclipsed by the reaction to revelations that retreating Russian soldiers left many slain civilians behind near the Ukrainian capital.

Some of the bodies found this past weekend outside Kyiv were face down, and some curled up. Civilians appear to have been killed on their bicycles, while walking down the street, or in the basements of homes. In Bucha, where many of the dead were discovered, three bodies were found in a garden.

Many of the victims had been shot in the head. A coroner in Bucha said his team had collected dozens. The Russians fired at anyone as their tanks rolled through the town in the war’s early days, some residents said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/05/world/europe/russia-ukraine-war-atrocities.html

With evidence mounting of atrocities in the Kyiv suburbs, and Russian forces preparing for a new offensive farther east, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine delivered a scathing speech to the United Nations on Tuesday, accusing Russia of a litany of horrors and questioning whether a world body that takes no action to stop a war serves any purpose.

Speaking via video link to the U.N. Security Council, he compared Russian forces to the Islamic State, called for a Nuremberg-like war crimes tribunal and vented his bitter frustration, knowing that the council — where Russia is one of five permanent members with veto power — would do nothing but talk.

“Where is the security that the Security Council needs to guarantee?” Mr. Zelensky said, raising the question of whether Russia deserved to keep its seat on the council. “Are you ready to close the U.N.? Do you think that the time of international law is gone? If your answer is no, then you need to act immediately.”

The chamber fell silent as a short video provided by Mr. Zelensky’s government played, showing some of the hundreds of corpses found strewn around the city of Bucha, northwest of Kyiv, after Russian forces retreated last week — bloated, charred bodies of civilians, including children. Some victims, their hands bound, had been shot in the head.

Mr. Zelensky said that in Bucha, “they killed entire families, adults and children, and they tried to burn the bodies.” Civilians “were crushed by tanks while sitting in their cars in the middle of the road,” he added, asserting that “women were raped and killed in front of their children; their tongues were pulled out.”

China refrained from criticizing Russia in Tuesday’s session, saying that the Security Council should wait until investigations establish the facts in Ukraine. A rising global power, China has drawn closer to Russia in recent years, united by a shared antipathy to the United States. The divisions on the war appeared essentially unchanged since Feb. 26, when 11 of 15 Security Council members voted for a resolution condemning Russia’s invasion, Russia vetoed the measure, and three others abstained — China, India and the United Arab Emirates.

Russia’s U.N. ambassador, Vasily Nebenzya, reiterated his government’s claims — rebutted by ample evidence — that atrocities in Bucha had been faked, or had not occurred when Russians held the city. He made a number of other unsupported claims, including stating falsely that in Ukraine — where the freely elected president is a Jew who lost family members in the Holocaust — Nazis are “running the show.”

After President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia launched the war on Ukraine on Feb. 24, his military became bogged down on several fronts in the face of logistical failures and unexpectedly fierce Ukrainian resistance. Russian forces spent weeks shelling and occupying cities and towns in northern Ukraine, where they took heavy losses as they failed to capture Kyiv, the capital. Last week they pulled back from that part of the country, preparing for what Russian officials and foreign analysts said would be a shift in focus toward eastern Ukraine.

“The next pivotal battle of the war” is likely to be for the eastern city of Sloviansk, according to a report released on Tuesday by the Institute for the Study of War, based in Washington.

Revulsion over the apparent executions discovered in Bucha deepened Russia’s economic isolation, despite its denials of responsibility.

The United States has started blocking Russia from making debt payments using dollars held in American banks, a move designed to deplete its international currency reserves and potentially push Russia toward its first foreign currency debt default in a century.

And as early as Wednesday, the Biden administration is expected to announce additional sanctions against Russia for the killings of Ukrainian citizens, according to a person familiar with the plans who was not authorized to detail them publicly. The administration will expand existing sanctions against Sberbank, the largest financial institution in Russia, and implement sanctions against Alfa Bank, one of the country’s largest private lenders. The administration also plans to announce sanctions against adult children of Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president.

The Biden administration has also authorized an additional shipment of up to $100 million in military supplies that will be taken from existing Defense Department stockpiles, the Pentagon announced in an email sent to reporters Tuesday night. This comes days after an additional $300 million in defense aid was announced April 1.

And the European Union took a significant step toward overcoming resistance to curbing fuel imports from Russia, on which its member nations rely heavily. The European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, proposed cutting off imports of Russian coal — oil and natural gas remain hotly debated — and barring Russian vessels from E.U. ports as part of a new round of sanctions.

The measures, which require unanimous approval, are expected to go to a vote of E.U. ambassadors on Wednesday. Diplomats said the sanctions package would target, among others, two daughters of Mr. Putin. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and the chief E.U. diplomat, Josep Borrell Fontelles, announced plans to visit Kyiv this week and meet with Mr. Zelensky.

The Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office said that it, along with the Kyiv police, had discovered what it called a Bucha “torture chamber,” where Russian forces had left behind the bodies of five men, their hands tied, who had been tortured and killed.

Mr. Zelensky reinforced a point that U.N. officials have made repeatedly: The true extent of Ukraine’s destruction and casualties is unknown but far greater than what has been documented, because outside observers have been unable to reach some of the most devastated areas. “Now the world can see what Russia did in Bucha, but the world has yet to see what it has done in other parts of our country,” Mr. Zelensky said.

New York Times journalists on Tuesday were able for the first time to reach the town of Borodyanka, northwest of Kyiv, battered by Russian rockets and airstrikes, where the mayor estimated 200 dead lay beneath the rubble. In the besieged port of Mariupol, local officials have put the death toll in the thousands.

Fierce fighting continues along Ukraine’s southern coast, where Mariupol, largely reduced to ruins by Russian bombardment, is “the center of hell,” said Martin Griffiths, the U.N. chief of humanitarian relief.

More than 250 miles west of Mariupol, explosions shuddered through the port of Mykolaiv, a day after the mayor said Russian strikes had killed 10 people and wounded 46. He said that Russians had hit residential buildings, schools, a hospital and an orphanage in his city since the war began, and had used cluster munitions. Soldiers defending the city said that increasingly, Russian forces were hitting civilian targets.

After four consecutive days of trying and failing to send an aid convoy into Mariupol, where people are desperately short of food, water, power, heat and medicines, the International Committee of the Red Cross decided against another attempt on Tuesday.

Ukrainian officials say the Russians have prevented crucial supplies from reaching the city. Mr. Nebenzya, the Russian U.N. ambassador, said the Ukrainians had blocked the convoy, and he claimed that Russian forces had evacuated 123,500 people from Mariupol.

The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said that in fact, tens of thousands of Ukrainians, including from Mariupol, had been taken to “filtration camps” in Russia, where family members were separated and people were stripped of passports and cellphones. “I do not need to spell out what these so-called filtration camps are reminiscent of,” she said. “It’s chilling, and we cannot look away.”

Rosemary A. DiCarlo, a U.N. under secretary general, said there was credible evidence that Russia had used cluster munitions — shells that burst open to spew many smaller bomblets over a wide area — at least 24 times in populated areas of Ukraine. Most countries have signed a treaty banning cluster munitions as indiscriminate weapons with a high risk of civilian casualties, but Russia, like the United States, has not.

More than 11 million Ukrainians — about one in four — have fled their homes because of the war, including more than 4 million who have left the country, according to the United Nations, creating Europe’s largest and fastest-growing refugee crisis since World War II.

Russian forces recently captured the eastern city of Izyum, and Western analysts say they are preparing for a drive to the south and southeast, to bolster efforts to seize more of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, where Russia-backed separatists have been fighting for eight years. Many of Ukraine’s best-equipped and most experienced military units have been concentrated in that area, known as Donbas.

“Russian forces continue to make little to no progress in frontal assaults” on the portions of Donbas still held by Ukraine, the Institute for the Study of War reported.

Whether the Russians aim simply to reinforce their units in Donbas, or are planning a more ambitious effort to encircle the Ukrainian forces, capturing Sloviansk is crucial, the institute said.

In the Luhansk region on Tuesday, an attack that Ukrainians blamed on Russian forces hit a storage tank containing nitric acid, releasing a toxic cloud and prompting the regional administrator to urge people to stay inside and close their windows.

The Russian units that withdrew from the region around Kyiv, having suffered heavy casualties, extensive equipment losses and poor morale, the institute said, “are highly unlikely to be effectively deployed elsewhere in Ukraine and are likely a spent force.”

An intelligence assessment released by the British defense ministry was less definitive, but said that any Russian forces redeploying from the north would first need considerable time to repair and replace equipment, and to make up for casualties.

In his speech — a day after touring Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv, the capital, where images have surfaced of many bodies of civilians Mr. Zelensky said had been killed by retreating Russian troops — the Ukrainian president said the Security Council was useless if it could not find a way to hold the perpetrators to account.

War in Ukraine

Warning: This story contains graphic and disturbing images and details from the Ukraine-Russia war.

Satellite images of the city of Bucha near Ukraine's capital Kyiv appear to confirm images that have emerged on social media and in media outlets showing mass graves and bodies in the street following Russia's bloody and brutal invasion.

Satellite imagery company Maxar released high-resolution photos taken from orbit that it says ""verifies and corroborates recent social media videos and photos that reveal bodies lying in the streets and left out in the open for weeks,"" according to an emailed statement.

Video and photos posted to social media by a local Ukrainian official show nearly a dozen bodies lying in the streets of one the suburb's neighborhood.

An analysis of the images by The New York Times also contradicts claims from the Kremlin that the bodies were ""another hoax,"" suggesting Ukrainians placed the bodies there themselves after March 30, roughly when Russian forces withdrew from Bucha.

The Times' analysis of the satellite images notes objects the size of human bodies lying on Yablonska Street in Bucha in the same locations shown on the video shot on the ground there. The satellite shots were captured on March 19, when Russian troops were still in control of the city.

Maxar imagery also shows photos of a mass grave found at a church nearby.

Media reports say hundreds of bodies, most civilians, were found in the grave behind the Church of St. Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints.

On Monday, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said over 300 people had been killed in Bucha. In an address to the United Nations Security Council Tuesday, he accused Russian troops of a long list of atrocities including rape, torture and murder of Ukrainian civilians and disposing of bodies by throwing them in wells. Zelenskyy then shared a graphic video showing images of destruction and death from across Ukraine.

""Yesterday I returned from our city of Bucha, recently liberated from Russian troops,"" Zelenskyy said via a video feed from Kyiv and speaking through a UN translator. ""There is not a single crime they would not commit there.""

US President Biden has called such acts ""war crimes"" and said Russian President Vladimir Putin should be brought to trial. As my CNET colleague Dan Avery explains, the International Criminal Court -- which investigates and tries individuals for genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression -- defines war crimes as the murder, torture or enslaving of civilians or prisoners of war; the taking of hostages; raping and looting; the wanton destruction of civilian property; and drafting children under 15 into the military.

While the acts reported in Bucha fit the definition of war crimes as defined by the International Criminal Court, and the court could indict Putin, Russia did not ratify the treaty accepting the court's jurisdiction.

Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, prompting broad condemnation and sanctions from countries in Europe, as well as the United States and Japan, among others. Russian forces have failed to capture the capital of Kyiv and have begun to withdraw forces from the northern part of the country, focusing instead on eastern and southern regions like the badly battered city of Mariupol.

Reports suggest thousands or even tens of thousands of Russian and Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in the fighting, although figures are hard to come by.

As of April 5, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights reports 1,480 Ukrainian civilians have been killed in the war, but OHCHR ""believes that the actual figures are considerably higher.""",https://www.cnet.com/science/space/satellite-images-of-corpses-in-in-bucha-appear-to-confirm-russian-atrocities/

Ukraine: 18 journalists killed in country since Russian invasion KYIV, Ukraine — The Ukrainian government says that 18 journalists have been killed in the country since Russia’s invasion began on Feb. 24. The Ukrainian Culture and Information Ministry said in a statement on social media Monday that each of the deaths and other crimes against media representatives will be investigated. The ministry added that another 13 journalists had been wounded, eight had been abducted or taken prisoner and three journalists were still missing. It said that several crimes had been committed against journalists from 11 countries, including Ukraine. Share this -







Ukrainian Foreign Minister: No place for Russia on the U.N. Human Rights Council Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said he has spoken with the head of the United Nations and pledged that Ukraine will do all it can to hold Russia accountable for war crimes. Kuleba tweeted that he spoke to U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres about what he called a massacre in the Kyiv-area city of Bucha. “Stressed that Ukraine will use all available UN mechanisms to collect evidence and hold Russian war criminals to account,” Kuleba wrote. “No place for Russia on the UN Human Rights Council.” Photos have shown what appeared to be the bodies of civilians in the street in Bucha after Russian forces left. Ukraine’s prosecutor-general has said that the bodies of 410 killed civilians have been removed from the Kyiv region. Residents of Bucha have accused Russian forces of targeting civilians. Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk said more than 300 people were killed. Russia’s Defense Ministry has denied the claims. Human Rights Watch also said Sunday that its investigators had documented “summary executions” and “other grave abuses” in several regions Russia controlled in Ukraine, including around Kyiv.

Zelenskyy to address U.N. Security Council Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he will address the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday, a day after he visited a town where authorities said they found hundreds of dead civilians. Speaking in a nightly address, Zelenskyy again called on democratically elected leaders to supply the country with more weapons and to impose “strong” sanctions on Russia “for the mass murders of civilians.” “Ukraine needs to get all the needed weapons in order to repulse the occupiers faster from our land,” he said. “To free our cities. And if we already had what we needed, all the planes, tanks, artillery, rocket defense systems, we could have saved thousands of people. I am not blaming you. I am only blaming the Russian soldiers. But you could help.” Earlier, Zelenksyy visited Bucha, one of the Kyiv-area towns where Ukrainian officials have said the bodies of 410 civilians have been found. Associated Press reporters who visited the city said some appeared to have been killed at close range; at least two had their hands tied behind their backs, and one had been shot in the head. Zelenskyy said there may be even more casualties in the nearby town of Borodyanka. Russia, which has veto power on the key 15-member U.N. Security Council, has denied targeting civilians, and its Defense Ministry has accused Ukrainian officials of staging the deaths in Bucha for Western media. Share this -







Death toll in another town outside Kyiv could top Bucha's, Zelenskyy says The number of fatally wounded victims in a town outside Kyiv could surpass the death toll in Bucha, where Ukrainian authorities have said they found hundreds of civilians’ bodies after Russian forces retreated, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday. Zelenskyy said officials have “information” showing potentially high fatality counts in Borodyanka, about 15 miles west of Bucha, and other towns that are no longer under Russian control. NBC News has not independently verified the claim, nor has it confirmed the 410 deaths that Ukrainian Prosecutor-General Iryna Venediktova said have been discovered in and around Bucha. After visiting Bucha and two other cities in the region, Zelenskyy said many bodies had been recovered in areas with bullet-riddled cars and torched military equipment. “It is especially hard to see the bullet holes on the cars that have ‘children’ written on them,” he said. A Maxar satellite image shows destroyed homes and vehicles Thursday along Vokzalna Street in Bucha, Ukraine. Satellite image (C)2022 Maxar Technologies Satellite images released Monday by a U.S. defense contractor, Maxar, showed what the company said were sections of Bucha that had been devastated by Russian bombardment. Blackened streets and charred vehicles could be seen next to houses that appeared to have been leveled. Zelenskyy said “all the crimes of the occupiers are being documented” for a war crimes investigation that he said would be “full and transparent.” “The time will come when every Russian will learn the whole truth about who killed their fellow citizens,” he said. “Who gave orders. Who turned a blind eye to the murders. We will establish all this and make it globally known. It is now 2022. And we have many more tools than those who prosecuted the Nazis after World War II.” Russian authorities have denied targeting civilians. In a statement, the country’s Defense Ministry accused Ukrainian authorities of having “stage managed” the casualties in Bucha “for the Western media.” Share this -







Drug shortages persist in Russia after start of Ukraine war First came the warnings, in messages among friends and families and on social media, to stock up on vital drugs in Russia before supplies were affected by crippling Western sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine. Then, some drugs indeed became harder to find at pharmacies in Moscow and other cities. Experts and health authorities in Russia say the drug shortages are temporary — due to panic- buying and logistical difficulties for suppliers from the sanctions — but some remain worried that high-quality medicines will keep disappearing in the Russian market. “Most likely there will be shortages. How catastrophic it will be, I don’t know,” said Dr. Alexey Erlikh, head of the cardiac intensive care unit in Moscow Hospital No. 29, and a professor at the Moscow-based Pirogov Medical University. Experts say panic-buying has played a role in creating drug shortages. “People rushed to stock up, and in some cases, supplies that were supposed to last a year or a year and a half were bought out within a month,” Nikolay Bespalov, development director of the RNC Pharma analytical company, told AP. Bespalov also pointed to logistical problems that occurred early in the crisis. While major Western pharmaceutical companies pledged not to withdraw vital medications from the Russian market, sanctions cut Russia’s key banks from the SWIFT financial messaging system, hindering international payments. Dozens of countries halted air traffic with Russia, disrupting supply chains. The expert stressed the logistical issues have been largely resolved, but panic-buying, prompted by fears that foreign companies will halt supplies, may continue fueling shortages for some time.

Ukrainian officials have accused Russian forces of blocking supplies and harming those trying to leave, which NBC News has not independently verified.

Number of Russian airstrikes on Ukraine declining, senior U.S. official says The number of Russian airstrikes on Ukraine has declined in recent days, and the Russians have “reprioritized” their air activity, a senior defense official said. The Russian forces have refocused on Ukrainian positions in the south and around Izyum, near Kharkiv in the eastern portion of Ukraine, the official said, and the level of airstrikes on Kyiv has fallen in recent days. Russian troops around Izyum have been moving south and southeast toward the Donbas region, where they are repositioning and reinforcing their artillery. Share this -

The U.S. believes they are being refitted, resupplied and perhaps reinforced with additional manpower, and then will be sent back into Ukraine to continue fighting elsewhere. The U.S. thinks they may go to the Donbas region. “That doesn’t mean Kyiv is not under threat,” said the official. “And it doesn’t mean the Russians can’t change course or that there isn’t still a ground threat against Kyiv. Nobody is spiking any footballs here.” Share this -

Biden administration is considering new sanctions on Russia, official says The Biden administration is considering adding more sanctions on Russia and tightening existing ones in response to actions by Russian troops in Bucha, according to a senior administration official. Speaking to reporters Monday morning, President Joe Biden confirmed that he will announce more sanctions, but did not give a timeline. The possible shift comes after reports of civilian massacres and mass graves in Bucha circulated, prompting international condemnation and claims that the attacks were war crimes. While it is unclear which retaliatory measures the administration is considering, The Washington Post reported that the Biden administration has previously discussed “secondary sanctions” on countries that continue to trade with Russia, as well as other measures targeting their economy not seen in previous rounds of sanctions.

More than 20 schools attacked in Ukraine per day, U.K. aid group says About 22 schools have been attacked in Ukraine per day since the war began five weeks ago, according to a news release Monday from the U.K. humanitarian organization Save the Children. The group said that ongoing military operations have disrupted the education of around 5.5 million children who remain in the country. More than 2 million children have fled, it noted. About 869 education facilities have been damaged — about 6 percent of schools in the country — and 83 destroyed, the Ukrainian ministry of education and science has said. Of those attacks, 43 percent have taken place in eastern Ukraine, where the organization said more than 400,000 children lived prior to Feb. 24. Peter Walsh, Save the Children's country director in Ukraine, called for those involved in the conflict to ""protect the civilian nature of schools, students, and education staff,"" as well as avoid using educational facilities for military purposes. ""Schools should be safe places of learning for children and must be free from attacks at all times,"" he said. The organization noted that the war has ""exacerbated an already challenging educational context"" in Ukraine. Prior to the conflict, the group said 30 percent of education facilities in eastern Ukraine reported not having enough teachers, a problem that is worsening as many flee the country.

Noting peace talks that recently took place in Istanbul, he said: ""it is very difficult to negotiate when you see what they have done here.""

Russia’s chief investigator orders inquiry into Ukraine's Bucha claims Russia’s chief investigator ordered an official probe into Ukraine’s accusations of Russian forces killing hundreds of civilians in the town of Bucha, near Kyiv. In a statement Monday, Russia’s Investigative Committee said it was looking into Ukraine’s claims, as well as images shared by Ukrainian officials that it said aimed to “discredit the Russian military personnel.” Russia has rejected the claim that its forces killed civilians in Bucha, despite photos and video appearing to show bodies on city streets as its troops pulled out of Bucha and other cities near Kyiv. It has branded Ukraine’s claims a “provocation.” NBC News has not been able to independently verify the photos. Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russia’s deputy ambassador to the United Nations, said in a tweet Sunday that Russia would also be requesting a meeting of the U.N. Security Council over what he called a “heinous provocation.” Share this -

We will do more to ramp up the pressure on Russia and we will keep pushing others to do more.” Truss is due to meet Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba in Poland’s capital, Warsaw, later Monday and her Polish counterpart Zbigniew Rau on Tuesday.

Zelenskyy says new sanctions not 'enough' after accusing Russia of atrocities in Bucha Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called on the international community to take stronger action to pressure Russia to end its invasion after grisly images purported to show slain civilians emerged out of the town of Bucha, near Kyiv. In a Sunday address, Zelenskyy said fresh sanctions from the West would not be ""enough"" to respond to the atrocities Ukrainians say have been committed in Bucha. ""There will definitely be a new sanctions package against Russia,"" he said. ""But I'm sure that's not enough. We need more conclusions. Not only about Russia, but also about the political behavior that actually allowed this evil to come to our land."" Russia has denied Ukraine's accusations that its forces left hundreds dead in Bucha. It has rejected all claims of targeting civilians in Ukraine since it launched its invasion in late February.

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

How you can help: Here are ways those in the U.S. can help support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.

9,6376e598-fd66-4f32-a284-0ef083dc3555,[],,"Dnipro, Ukraine — Russian forces have withdrawn from around Ukraine's capital Kyiv, but there has been no celebration in the country. What they've left behind is difficult to comprehend, and even more difficult to see. CBS News warns our readers that both the video report above and the article below contain disturbing material.

Independent journalists who went into the town of Bucha, just northwest of the capital, over the weekend found the streets littered with bodies. The dead were wearing civilian clothing, and some had their hands tied behind their backs, apparently executed.

Others were buried in a mass grave. More than 300 residents were killed, according to the town's mayor.

In the central Ukrainian village of Kalynivka, closer to the southern and eastern Ukrainian cities Russia has hammered with artillery and air strikes for weeks, Irina Kostenko said the Russians killed her only son, Oleksei.

She said she brought her son's body back home in a wheelbarrow and then buried him by herself in the garden, wrapped in a rug, in a shallow grave.

He was killed at 27, but Kostenko clung to a photo of him as a child as she stood by his grave.

""This is my love, my sweetheart,"" she said.

CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams reports that Ukrainian officials shared photos taken on a highway outside the capital over the weekend showing the naked corpses of at least four women. The officials said Russian troops tried to burn the women's bodies.

Human Rights Watch and other groups have documented cases of alleged rape by Russian troops during the invasion, which Vladimir Putin launched on February 24. Ukrainian officials are investigating.

Speaking Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of committing genocide in his country. ""We are being destroyed and exterminated"" he said, ""and this is happening in the Europe of the 21st century.""

On Monday, Zelenskyy visited Bucha to inspect the damage and speak with residents. Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to Ukraine's Interior Ministry, said the president found ""evidence of mass killings.""

According to Geraschchenko, a BBC correspondent asked Zelenskyy if he still believed it would be possible to negotiate for peace with Russia. The president said it would, ""because Ukraine must find peace. We are in 21st century Europe. We will continue our diplomatic, and military efforts.""

The southeast port city of Mariupol has been besieged and bombarded by the Russians for almost 40 days, since the war started. Thousands may have been killed there alone, according to the United Nations, but it's impossible to get an accurate picture because Mariupol has been cut off from the outside world.

Ilona, 17, and her 10-year-old brother Milan made it out of the city on Friday with their parents. CBS News found them sitting silently at an evacuation center, apparently shell-shocked.

""There were constant bombing raids, constant explosions,"" Ilona told Williams. There were times they thought they would die in their city, but she said tried throughout the ordeal to ""hold ourselves together — we tried not to panic.""

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said almost two weeks ago that the U.S. had determined that Russian forces had committed ""war crimes"" in Ukraine, accusing them of ""indiscriminate attacks and attacks deliberately targeting civilians.""

On Sunday, he told CNN the images from Bucha were ""a punch to the gut,"" and he said the U.S. was ""working to document"" and provide its own information ""to the relevant institutions and organizations that will put all of this together"" to ensure any forces guilty of war crimes would he held accountable.

""We can't normalize this,"" he said. ""This is the reality of what's going on every single day, as long as Russia's brutality against Ukraine continues. That's why it needs to come to an end.""

We strongly condemn apparent atrocities by Kremlin forces in Bucha and across Ukraine. We are pursuing accountability using every tool available, documenting and sharing information to hold accountable those responsible. — Secretary Antony Blinken (@SecBlinken) April 4, 2022

On Monday, Russian officials denied civilians were killed in Bucha. The Russian defense ministry claimed the gruesome scenes in Bucha were faked by Ukrainian forces as a ""provocation."" It has become a common refrain from Moscow, issued after previous alleged atrocities came to light in this war, and during Russia's long involvement in Syria's brutal civil war.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov dismissed the reports of what he called a ""fake attack"" in Bucha and said Russia was demanding ""an urgent meeting of the Security Council on this particular issue because we see such provocations as a direct threat to international peace and security.""

But the United Nations human rights chief was among those voicing horror at the scenes from Bucha on Monday.

""I am horrified by the images of civilians lying dead on the streets and in improvised graves in the town of Bucha in Ukraine,"" the U.N.'s Michelle Bachelet said in a statement. ""Reports emerging from this and other areas raise serious and disturbing questions about possible war crimes, grave breaches of international humanitarian law and serious violations of international human rights law.""

CBS News correspondent Pamela Falk at the U.N. said U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield had discussed with Romania's prime minister on Monday America's intention to try to get Russia's suspended from the U.N. Human Rights Council.

According to a readout of Thomas-Greenfield's meeting with the Romanian leader, she said Russia's expulsion from the rights body was needed, ""in light of the mounting evidence that members of Russian forces are committing war crimes in Ukraine and following horrific reports about violence against civilians in Bucha.""

Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi, standing aside his Polish counterpart during a visit to Warsaw, said he was ""deeply shocked by news of the exceptionally cruel acts of violence against civilians near Kyiv.""

""The murder of innocent civilians is a violation of international humanitarian law and is unacceptable and I strongly condemn these acts,"" he added. ""The Russian assault is a blatant violation of international law.""

We knew Putin’s invasion plans included summary executions by his military and intelligence services. The reports of execution-style killings of civilians emerging from liberated areas are horrifying and chilling. https://t.co/Yea1Lhsqe6 — Richard Moore (@ChiefMI6) April 3, 2022

In London, the head of Britain's equivalent of the CIA, MI6 chief Richard Moore, said in a tweet that Russia had planned mass-executions as part of its strategy in Ukraine. He shared an earlier message from the U.K. Foreign Secretary demanding that those responsible for the killings documented in Kyiv's suburbs be held to account.

As Williams reported, the Russian soldiers accused of massacring unarmed civilians in Bucha and elsewhere in Ukraine will likely never be brought to justice.

But despite the horrific images and thousands of his own soldiers being killed on the battlefield, a new poll in Russia found that Putin's approval rating had risen to 83% since the invasion began.

While thousands have been arrested for protesting against the Ukraine war in Russian cities over the last month, many Russians rely entirely on the country's state-run news organizations for their information. Those outlets present only the Kremlin's version of what Putin calls the ""special military operation,"" and no Russian media outlets are free to report the truth about what's happening in Ukraine.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bucha-massacre-ukraine-russia-putin-provocation-war-crimes-atrocities/
