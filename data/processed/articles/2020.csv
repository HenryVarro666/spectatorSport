Galina Danilchenko, a former member of the city council, was proclaimed the acting mayor on local TV Saturday, CNN reported.

Mayor Ivan Fedorov was taken from Melitopol’s crisis center Friday with a plastic bag over his head after he “refused to cooperate with the enemy,” Ukraine’s parliament said.

More than 2,000 residents of the Russian-occupied city in the Kremlin-backed rebel region of Luhansk staged a rally to support Fedorov Saturday, while Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky demanded his immediate release.

But in a televised statement, Danilchenko said she aimed to get the city “back to normal” and warned against those who would “provoke a reaction of bad behavior.”

“I ask you to keep your wits about you and not to give in to these provocations,” she said.

On at least one of the posts, explosions could be heard in the night behind him as he tried to reassure residents that the city was functioning as normally as possible.

On March 2, for example, noting that armed men had opened fire in the direction of some demonstrators, he warned residents away from confrontations with the Russian soldiers during protests and asked them to respect a 6 p.m. curfew. “I consider it unacceptable when civilians are shot at!” he wrote. “Melitopol residents, in turn, are asked not to provoke and to behave peacefully on the streets. Our task is to save your life and safety.”

On March 5, he announced that the city was working to restore 31 private houses destroyed by the Russian forces, and he repeatedly thanked local firms for contributing goods and services to help hundreds of displaced families.

All along the mayor made it abundantly clear that his administration would not cooperate with the Russians, and he kept the Ukrainian flag flying high over the city’s central square.

“We are not cooperating with the Russians in any way,” Mr. Fyodorov said in an interview with the BBC two days before he was taken by the Russian soldiers. “They have not tried to help us, they cannot help us and we do not want their help.”

He told residents where to buy milk and medicine, published updated lists of what pharmacies or A.T.M.s were operating and warned repeatedly that looters would be identified and punished. He urged them to keep paying their electricity bills, since the money went toward salaries, and as public transportation ceased operating asked residents to give free rides to medical workers.

Residents responded with an outpouring of gratitude, thanking him profusely for staying at his post even after the Russian troops controlled the city. “You are the best mayor!” read one enthusiastic response to his social media messages, while another wrote “You are our hope!!”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/12/world/europe/ukraine-mayor-kidnapped-ivan-fyodorov.html

The deputy head of Ukraine's presidential office, Kirill Timoshenko, shared a video on the social media site Telegram that appeared to show the moment Mr Fedorov was captured and escorted across a square in the city centre.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of employing ""a new stage of terror"" with the alleged kidnapping.

It led to more than 2,000 people taking to streets of the city demanding his release.

Mr Zelenskyy called on Russian forces to heed the calls. ""Please hear in Moscow!"" he said.

""Another protest against Russian troops' attempts to bring the city to its knees.""

He has also spoken to Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett asking him for help in freeing Mr Fedorov.

Melitopol, about 120 miles (190km) west of Mariupol in southeastern Ukraine, has a population of 150,000 and fell under Russian control on 26 February.
