1,3d6c6cb4-8fdd-4395-a4ab-429b3f15cb72,"['Eric Schmitt', 'Helene Cooper', 'Julian E. Barnes']",2022-03-03,"WASHINGTON — Ukraine’s soldiers have blown up bridges to halt advancing Russian ground troops. Its pilots and air defenses have prevented Russian fighter jets from conquering the skies. And a band of savvy Ukrainian cyberwarriors are so far beating Moscow in an information war, inspiring support at home and abroad.

To the surprise of many military analysts, Ukrainian troops are mounting a stiffer-than-expected resistance to Russian forces up and down battle lines across a country the size of Texas, fighting with a resourcefulness and creativity that U.S. analysts said could trip up Russian troops for weeks or months to come.

The Ukrainians are also exploiting a bungled beginning to Russia’s all-out assault. Armed with shoulder-fired anti-tank weapons, they have attacked a mileslong Russian armored convoy bearing down on Kyiv, the capital, helping stall an advance plagued by fuel and food shortages, and stretching a march that was expected to take a handful of days into possibly weeks.

To be sure, Russia’s invasion is only a week old. The strategic southern city of Kherson fell on Wednesday; the Kremlin’s army has intensified its bombardment of Kyiv and other cities; and, despite a flow of fresh arms pouring in from the West, Ukrainian leaders say they desperately need more weapons to destroy Russian tanks and down Russian warplanes.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/03/us/politics/russia-ukraine-military.html
2,3d6c6cb4-8fdd-4395-a4ab-429b3f15cb72,['The Economist'],,"IN UKRAINE’S WEST families flee from war as one, but crumble into pieces upon arrival. Using powers conferred by martial law, the government has banned all men aged 18-60 from leaving the country. Instead they must report for duty at a military recruitment office. And so Anna was this week one of many women to bid her husband goodbye as she crossed the border to safety. She is seven months pregnant. Back in Kyiv, her abandoned apartment is full of baby clothes and the cot that she has chosen for her daughter. Anna’s husband, she says via phone from Hungary, “believes that I will give birth in Kyiv,” because peace will come by May. “But I don’t believe it.”

The Ukrainian army enjoys stratospheric morale and is punching far above its weight against Vladimir Putin’s troops, tanks and missiles. Thousands of foreigners have flocked to join its newly created International Legion, while Russian troops abandon their posts. Volodymyr Zelensky, the country’s president, knows his country’s fight is just, whereas Russia’s is rotten. For that he derides Mr Putin, who ""collects reservists and conscripts from all over Russia to throw them into the hell of war”.

Russia’s generals did not tell troops that they would be invading Ukraine in a war of territorial conquest. Russian lawmakers have acknowledged that the army includes conscripts who were forced to sign a contract affirming that they were “volunteers”. Intercepted radio communications suggest some have abandoned their posts. Other soldiers have mutinied, deliberately running over their commander in one instance, Western officials claim. On March 24th British intelligence suggested that Russia was looking to enlist more conscripts to replace the killed and injured, who are rumoured to number in the tens of thousands. Unmotivated and ill-prepared troops are commonly cited as one of the main reasons that Russia’s invasion has gone so badly wrong.

Ironically, though, Ukraine’s army is built on conscription as well. For years Ukrainian law has demanded 12 to 18 months of military service from Ukrainian men, even if many of them manage to postpone it through studies or parenthood (registering with a fake address is a popular trick to duck it entirely). The practice of conscription itself, like so much else about Ukraine, is a relic that it has tried to shed: when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, all its men had to complete at least three years of military service. Four of Ukraine’s last five elected presidents promised to abolish it. One succeeded in 2013, but it was reinstated the following year, after Russia began grabbing chunks of Ukrainian territory. Last month, just before the war started, Mr Zelensky proposed an end to conscription by early 2024.

So far Ukraine has forcibly enlisted only those with combat experience, even if much of that experience was derived from conscription. The “general mobilisation” announced by Mr Zelensky on the eve of the war is split into four “waves”. On March 15th the army announced that the second of those waves (former servicemen and reservists with combat experience prior to 2014) would commence. Only in the fourth and final wave, if it comes to that, will ordinary citizens need to head to the front.

At present, military kit is harder for Ukraine’s army to come by than men are. Even before the war it was among the largest in Europe. The government has since raised frontline soldiers’ pay to 100,000 hryvnias ($3,400) a month, seven times the average salary; the bills are being paid through war bonds. By March 6th some 100,000 Ukrainians had already chosen to enlist in the territorial defence force, a new branch of the military. Some wonder whether the popularity of Ukraine’s cause makes conscription unnecessary. At any rate, for the army to call up citizens en masse would require the war to take a dark turn.

What is happening now is not full conscription. One recent morning scores of young men, some gruff, some tender, were waiting outside a recruitment office in Lviv. All newcomers to the city must register there within 24 hours of arrival. An officer pokes his head outside and bellows: “Who here wants to serve”? Only a few men put their hands up and trot in. Those men will go straight to the front. The rest are merely there to provide their names, contact information and a list of their skills. Then they will wait for the call.

Elsewhere, civilians feel mistreated. One family outside Lviv station was distraught: the father was exempt from service as his child has autism, but lacked the documents proving he was the boy’s guardian, and so he could not board the train to Poland. They had rushed to pack the day before when bombs hit their town of Izyum, near Kharkiv. In the case of Anna’s family, her husband refuses to fight on pacifist grounds: “We are people of the church,” she explains. The law allows for this. But army officials “were very aggressive” and tried to send him to battle, she says. The defence ministry has set up a hotline for anyone who feels he was wrongly shipped off to fight.

Conversations with Ukrainians in Lviv reveal strong support for such rules, even if they are imperfectly enforced. “The men must protect the children, the women and the country,” says Evhenii, an economist from Kyiv who has relocated to Lviv. Dmytro, an IT worker from the capital signing up at a recruitment office, says he feels a moral obligation to enlist as well as a legal one: “I want to be useful.” His mother and sister are abroad. If he goes to fight, his wife may join them.

Ukraine remains a society where old-fashioned family norms remain popular, even if a tenth of its combat troops are women. Yana is a police officer from the city of Avdiivka, which sits on the frontline of Ukraine’s earlier war against Russia-backed separatists in Donbas. Her boyfriend serves alongside her. But when Russia invaded, the police force instructed all its women to leave. Yana’s boyfriend is still there, while she is in Lviv with her family. But she says she supports such rules, as they help men “work without worrying about their family’s safety”.

Many feel that conscription during peacetime not only forces people to fight against their will, but also makes little economic sense. It costs a fortune and pulls people away from their preferred jobs. That line of thinking helped persuade America to end conscription in 1972. (Of course, it was not fighting a war of survival against a larger invader.) Even in wartime, Ukraine’s minister for digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, has suggested exempting the country’s IT workers from military duties so that they could aid the war effort from behind a computer, or simply work to “fill the budget”, though some feel that this unfairly benefits the well-off.

Asylum and human-rights laws offer states ample room to force citizens to fight, or forbid them from fleeing. Anna acknowledges that her country’s circumstances are exceptional. But she cannot help but recall images of Syrian refugees in Europe having fled Russian bombs—men, women and children, suffering acutely but suffering together. Anna dreams of a family reunion. But it may not come until well after May.

3,3d6c6cb4-8fdd-4395-a4ab-429b3f15cb72,['Alex Gatopoulos'],2022-03-09,"Despite perceptions of Russia’s military strength, Ukraine has been able to slow the Russian advance. We examine how.

The war in Ukraine has highlighted two things to Russia and the outside world: that Russia’s much-vaunted military revolution has been exaggerated and that Ukraine’s resistance to the invasion is total.

Russia’s military capabilities have been built up in Western eyes, particularly after its modernisation programme in the wake of the 2008 Georgian conflict. New equipment was ordered and training focused on realism as Russia’s armed forces were put on a more professional footing. A new doctrine, designed to give the military greater flexibility in responding to a variety of scenarios, was also developed.

Russia’s new “hybrid” military tactics were highlighted by the relatively bloodless takeover of the Crimean peninsula in 2014, when “grey” operations – those below the threshold of actual conflict – were seen. Russian soldiers gradually infiltrated the region without firing a shot, their mere presence achieving Russia’s strategic aim of taking Crimea.

Since then, Russia’s military has been running increasingly sophisticated annual large-scale exercises and has had months to build up its forces on the border of Ukraine, amassing supplies, fuel and ammunition for an invasion that few on the ground in Ukraine and in the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk believed would actually happen.

At most, a Russian military operation to partially seize the two breakaway republics was predicted, but when Russia finally invaded it went way beyond this – driving past Donetsk and Luhansk and advancing from multiple fronts right into the heart of the country.

And then it got stuck.

Russian military vehicles quickly ran out of fuel and soldiers ran out of food despite food and fuel stockpiles being nearby on the other side of the border.

Meanwhile, the hundreds of missile attacks and air strikes on Ukrainian bases and command and control centres, carried out on the first day, failed to achieve their aim of destroying Ukrainian military resistance.

Where is Russia’s air force?

These opening attacks saw Ukrainian airbases targeted but not destroyed; the Russian strikes lacked the intensity needed to stop the Ukrainian air force in its tracks.

Despite having an air force many times the size of Ukraine’s, Russia was unable to dominate the skies in the way necessary to protect the smooth and speedy advance of its mechanised columns of armour on the ground. These units now faced Ukrainian air strikes as they pushed deeper into the country.

This lack of coordination between Russian air and ground units left gaps in the defensive shield around advancing Russian armour, also allowing Ukrainian ground forces to successfully attack Russian armed helicopters, destroying many and depriving Russian army units of their protection and support.

Ukrainian air defence units successfully downed several Russian jets, further discouraging the Russian air force from flying too many sorties and dominating the target airspace, a vital objective in any conflict.

Ukrainian jets were able to fly combat missions, often flying low over towns and cities as a morale boost to the population. Despite initial losses, Ukrainian jets are still a serious challenge to Russia’s air force.

However, a deal to supply the country with Soviet legacy aircraft from its neighbours has fallen through and Ukraine is in desperate need of replacement jets if it is to prevent Russia from eventually dominating the skies over the battlefield. It may have to rely on its armed drones if it is to stop Russia.

Ukraine’s drones

Ukraine has made effective use of its meagre complement of armed UAVs or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. Its Turkish-made TB2 armed UAVs have been flying combat missions, not only carrying out air strikes on Russian vehicles and command posts but conducting intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions.

They act as real-time spotters for Ukraine’s long-range artillery, allowing the Ukrainian military to destroy columns of armour, supply trucks and troop concentrations before they even reach the battlefield, blunting Russia’s advance.

In the last week, more TB2s have been delivered to Ukraine from Turkey as part of a larger assistance package. This helps offset Ukraine’s smaller air force as the TB2 drones prove their worth.

Ukraine’s domestically made armed drone, The Punisher, while only armed with a small bomb, is very hard to detect and has inflicted damage on Russian air defence systems and radar that are vulnerable and easily knocked out of commission.

Russia, on the other hand, has been slow to develop its own armed UAVs and has only just started to deploy them in combat. This lack of ability to determine an opponent’s movements combined with a drone’s offensive capabilities has Russia at a real disadvantage as the Ukrainian military has had a far clearer picture of Russian objectives and tactics.

Morale

The tepid advance of Russian forces has been linked to poor leadership, lack of supplies and the low morale of Russian soldiers. Initial reports from captured personnel showed that many of them had been told that they were only being deployed on exercises, not to an active war zone.

There has also been a lack of understanding among the rank and file of the Russian military about why they are fighting this war, particularly as Russia and Ukraine have always been culturally linked.

Despite this initial reticence among some of the Russian soldiers to fight their neighbour, Russia has an estimated 150,000 troops in Ukraine, and many of them are highly motivated, well trained and well equipped. And while they may not have known where they were going at the beginning of the conflict, they certainly know now.

A drawn-out conflict will in some ways favour Russia as it uses these units to eventually wear down the Ukrainian military. Ukraine’s army of 126,000 at the start of the conflict was not small – it is, for example, larger than France’s – but Russia’s army is vast, comprising 280,000 soldiers with a further 50,000 airborne troops. Russia also has extensive experience of urban combat, formed in the Chechen capital Grozny and northern Syria, which will stand it in good stead in what is swiftly turning into a war for Ukraine’s major cities.

Nevertheless, a nimble Ukrainian opposition is consistently inflicting heavy losses on a slow-moving Russian military that has had its reputation tarnished by its ineptitude. There is a distinct possibility that Russia will become increasingly heavy-handed in its attempts to capture Ukrainian population centres as Ukraine’s united resolve to defend its land results in Russian casualties and reverses on the battlefield.

Total war

Ukraine’s response to the invasion has been nothing short of total. The entire country has been mobilised. Many have fled, but many more remain and are contributing to the fight.

Volunteer units dig trenches, and fortify buildings and strong points around the towns and cities they live in. Improvised tank traps have been built along likely approaches for Russian armour. Food kitchens have been set up all over the country as meals are cooked, then distributed to local volunteers.

Ukraine’s army has been dramatically expanded as reservists and volunteers swamp recruitment stations. Media teams on the ground report that newly formed units manning checkpoints and roadblocks have become more disciplined and professional, as the entire country focuses on one thing only – resisting the enemy.

Politically, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has excelled at getting his message across, inspiring resistance and sustained effort. Russian President Vladimir Putin, by contrast, seems isolated and out of touch, his inner circle now hammered by unprecedented sanctions.

The propaganda war has gone into full swing as social media is inundated with the very real images of suffering and stoic preparation and training by a civilian population determined to fight. Very few images are shown of regular Ukrainian military units. However, it is not enthusiastic civilians destroying columns of Russian armour but Ukraine’s armed forces that are doing the bulk of the damage to Russia. Little is coming out from the Russian side that is not a defence ministry handout.

Yet, despite Ukraine’s valiant efforts the Russians slowly advance. The capital, Kyiv, is being approached from two sides, Ukraine’s major cities are being contested, with Kherson in the south under Russian control.

The race is now on to pressure Russia to stop the conflict. The outside world is using severe sanctions and large arms transfers, and the Ukrainians themselves are attempting to inflict losses on a scale that will be unacceptable to Russia.

Even if Russia was to somehow win this war, the ensuing insurgency would ensure a constant stream of body bags back to the small towns and villages that still form Putin’s power base, further eroding any legitimacy he has left.",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2022/3/9/total-war-how-ukraine-mobilised-a-country-as-russia-overreached-2
4,3d6c6cb4-8fdd-4395-a4ab-429b3f15cb72,[],2022-02-26,"KHMELNYTSKYI, Ukraine — By the second day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, everything in Khmelnytskyi had changed. As the Russian military breached Kyiv, the capital, and people fled en masse, this western Ukrainian city of nearly 300,000 swelled with activity. Tension took hold as resources became sparser. And the Ukrainian army had set up sandbags as an impromptu registration desk for signing up conscripts. With the blue and yellow of Ukraine’s flag streaming from every lamppost, some 100 men between the ages of 18 and 60 lined up to board buses leaving for active duty. With martial law declared on the first day of the conflict, they had become required to serve.

“Now is no time for feelings. If it is necessary to go to war, then that’s what it is.”

Rumors, social media, and news reports gave accounts of buses being stopped at Ukraine’s borders so that men planning to leave could be offloaded to join the fight. But in the city center of Khmelnytskyi, they were ready to enlist — unafraid, if not exactly thrilled — to protect their country. “Now is no time for feelings. If it is necessary to go to war, then that’s what it is,” said Viktor, 58, the owner of a medical business, who like other conscripts interviewed for this story declined to give his last name. “We are proud to do this for our country.”

The conscriptions, reluctant or not, are part of a broad, societywide mobilization by Ukraine to fend off a vastly superior Russian military force. In addition to mandatory military service, civilians are reportedly taking up arms in Kyiv, and the Defense Ministry told citizens to “make Molotov cocktails.”

In more than a dozen interviews for this article conducted over two days in Khmelnytskyi — including with conscripts, soldiers, refugees, and journalists — there was unanimity that Ukraine was being abandoned by the international community. The men lamented that, under President Joe Biden, the U.S. was not intervening militarily in the war. “Your President Biden said that God will help us,” said one conscript, Vasily, 49, who also asked that his last name not be used. “Of course, we hoped for American and European help. But we were left naked!”

The young and the old alike waited their turn as military officers made the rounds with a clipboard of names. None of the draftees knew where they might be headed next. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s declaration of martial law, made within hours after the first Russian bombs began to fall, along with a state of emergency enacted by the legislature the day before, gave the government broad discretion to restrict free movement and suspend civil liberties. This general mobilization of conscripts and reservists falls under the special authorities. “My country needs me,” said a state historian, 47, who had been conscripted and who declined to give his name. “I’m here because I’m a patriot.” Khmelnytskyi, about 170 miles southwest of Kyiv, remains peaceful for now. Many speculated before the war that western Ukraine would be spared, but the conscripts doubted it. A military target just 25 miles north of the city, in the village of Starokostiantyniv, had already been bombed on the first day of the invasion; by Saturday, businesses closed as unconfirmed rumors of impending rocket strikes circulated through the city. The historian pointed the finger at the aggression from Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin, invoking the last existential crisis to hit Ukraine: World War II. “Russia has violated all moral, ethical, and social principles and values,” he said. “Russia attacked us like Nazi Germany once did.” Vasily, the conscript, spoke about the post-Soviet agreement Ukraine made to denuclearize its military in exchange for guaranteed territorial integrity: “Is the Budapest Memorandum not still valid?”

Russia’s attack on Ukraine: day 8

On the eighth day of the fighting, the Armed Forces of Ukraine launched a counterattack towards Kyiv, using the reserve forces (most likely two brigades’ worth) which had hitherto been stationed in the western part of the country, securing the border with Belarus from the side of Volhynia. The group displaced the Russian reconnaissance units and reached the Sarny-Kyiv Road (in the areas around the towns of Poliske in Zhytomyr oblast and Kukhary in Kyiv oblast), but it did not break through the defensive positions. The Ukrainians’ greatest success was the resistance at Makariv the day before. The Russians are holding back the Ukrainian attack with the forces of two battalion tactical groups (BTG).

Most of the Russian forces (up to 15 BTGs) concentrated in the Zhytomyr and Kyiv oblasts (in the Polesia direction) are continuing the operation to flank Kyiv on the right bank of the Dnieper, conducting activities in the Kozarovychi-Vyshhorod-Fastiv-Obukhiv zone. The Russian units advancing in order to widen the encirclement have reached the towns of Byshiv (the fighting should take place between here and the town of Horenychi bordering Kyiv) and Ukrainka. After many hours of fighting, the defenders of Kyiv pushed the Russians out of the villages of Bucha and Vorzel near Kyiv (the battle for Hostomel is still ongoing), thanks to which they have made it possible to start evacuating the population from the most endangered areas northwest of Kyiv. The encirclement on the left bank of the Dnieper (in the Severia direction) is also being tightened, where 14 BTGs of Russian forces are operating in the Oster-Zazymie-Berezan-Vishenksy strip, and the main attack is being targeted at Brovary. On both sides of the Dnieper, Russian troops have advanced to around 50 km from the centre of Kyiv.

In the eastern (Slobodka) direction, the Russian forces are continuing their offensive with up to 16 BTGs. The northern grouping is operating from the area around the town of Zinkiv (in the Poltava region, 60 km from Mirhorod), while the southern group is operating from the area around the town of Hadiach (in the Kharkiv region, south of Krasnohrad). The main Russian attack is on Novomoskovsk, north-east of the city of Dnipro. The Russians abandoned some of their positions in the vicinity of Kharkiv, which is now apparently only cut off from the north, and for the first time in many days it was not bombed at night. In the auxiliary direction south of Kharkiv, Russian troops have captured Balakliya. In the Slobodka direction, as in the Severia direction, there are many besieged and destroyed towns within the Russian operation area, but these have not been occupied by either Russian troops or by the surviving Ukrainian sub-units undertaking irregular operations. For the first time since the beginning of the operation, the Ukrainian defence lines have been broken by the so-called separatists; these have been reinforced by units of the Russian 8th All-Military Army, whose subunits should expand their success in the directions of Novoaidar and Volnovakha (they have reached Novo-Aleksandrivka in Donetsk oblast, and Starobelsk in Luhansk oblast).

For the first time since the start of the attack on Ukraine, there have been no significant troop movements in the Taurida direction. The eastern group is continuing to flank Zaporizhzhia, and is using part of its forces to reinforce the siege of Mariupol. Last night, the Russian sub-unit which had so far been blocking off Enerhodar took control of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. As a result, fires broke out in the plant’s buildings (these were quite effectively put out), but no radiation hazard exists. The western group is besieging Mykolaiv (last night the defenders apparently destroyed an equipment base at the airport occupied by the Russians), and is continuing its offensive activities from the Voznesensk region. A joint grouping of the Russian Navy in the Black Sea is preparing for a landing operation in the area of ​​Zatoka and Chornomorsk, south-west of Odesa. The Russian air force should have begun destroying Ukrainian firing positions (mainly air defence) in this area. In Odesa the Ukrainians scuttled the Ukrainian Navy’s only large combat unit and flagship, the frigate Hetman Sahaidachny.

The Russian strike force has brought most of the secondary units into combat. Ukraine is to host 111 out of 117 tactical battalion groups of the Russian Armed Forces, whose presence around the borders of Ukraine (including Belarus) and in the occupied territories was recorded before 24 February. Russia may also have exhausted the stock of Kalibr missiles originally accumulated for the operation. The Ukrainian Air Force has announced that new missiles for the Iskander systems have been delivered to Belarus. According to the Ukrainian General Staff, preparations have begun in Russia to transfer additional forces and resources from the Southern and Eastern Military Districts. The US has provided detailed information on Russia’s use of ballistic and winged missiles: of the 480 missiles launched, more than 160 were launched from Russia, 70 from Belarus, and 10 from the Black Sea. The Russian army fired as many as 230 missiles from launchers introduced onto Ukrainian territory.

On 4 March, Ukrainian defence minister Oleksiy Reznikov issued a statement summarising the previous 196 hours of defence, in which, apart from providing information on the successes of the Ukrainian army, Russian war crimes, losses and demoralisation among the aggressor’s ranks, he referred to the situation in the fighting areas. He considered it necessary to leave the existing lines of defence (“we had to manoeuvre to save the army”) and admitted that the Ukrainian army was taking considerable losses in the ongoing fighting, and still had a difficult period ahead of it.

The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine provided estimates of the Russian army’s losses. Since the beginning of the aggression, they have amounted to 9166 soldiers, 251 tanks, 939 armoured vehicles, 105 artillery systems, 50 multi-rocket launchers, 18 anti-aircraft systems, 33 planes, 37 helicopters, 404 motor vehicles, and 60 fuel tanks.

The Ukrainian institutions responsible for security (SBU, Ministry of the Interior) are working intensively to neutralise Russian sabotage groups and Russian military intelligence agencies. The number of arrests of people coordinating the Russian army’s rocket or artillery fire has visibly increased. At the initiative of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence, as part of the psychological warfare, the website russoldat.info was created – it contains personal data of Russian soldiers involved in the invasion of Ukraine. This is another initiative aimed at reaching Russian society and increasing its awareness about the true state of the war.

During a session of the Russian Federation’s Security Council on 3 March, Vladimir Putin said that the operation in Ukraine was “going as planned”, praised the heroism of Russian soldiers, and repeated the lie about Ukrainian “neo-Nazis abusing prisoners”. He promised financial support to the families of the fallen and wounded, and stated that Ukrainian society had largely been “stunned by Nazi propaganda.” He further stated that in Ukraine, foreign mercenaries are using civilians and “thousands of foreigners” as human shields. He also repeated that the Russian forces are “fighting for Russia”, and for the “demilitarisation and de-Nazification of Ukraine”, so that “no anti-Russia can threaten us – this also applies to the threat of nuclear weapons.” Putin promised to pay 7.4 million roubles (about $69,000 at the 4 March exchange rate) to the families of soldiers killed in Ukraine and 5 million (about $47,000) worth of additional benefits, as well as financial support (compensations, pensions) for the wounded and war invalids.

On 3 March, a second round of Ukrainian-Russian talks was held in Belarus. The Russian side has not altered its position on the continuation of the offensive in Ukraine, including its “demilitarisation and de-Nazification”. After the meeting, the Ukrainian side confirmed that an agreement had been reached on the creation of humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians from the places of the fiercest fighting (the defence ministries of both countries are still establishing the details). It has been announced that a further round of talks will take place at the beginning of next week in Belarus. Ukraine has asked the International Red Cross to organise humanitarian corridors out of the besieged towns and cities.

President Zelenskiy once again called on the world to react immediately, to force the Russians to cease hostilities, to close the airspace over Ukraine, and for NATO countries to hand over combat aircraft. At the same time, he called on Putin to hold talks to stop the war. The Ukrainian parliament passed a law providing for the nationalisation of Russian real estate and the seizure of the bank accounts, securities, and property of Russian enterprises and citizens.

According to data from the Polish Border Guard, 99,200 people crossed the border with Poland on 3 March, making a total of 624,500 people since the beginning of the invasion. The Ukrainian Railways are continuing to evacuate residents: most trains are running from Lviv towards Poland, to Przemyśl, Chełm and Hrubieszów; while from Chop they are running towards Hungary. In the evening of 4 March, evacuation trains are to start running from Kyiv to Warsaw. The European Commission has passed a directive giving refugees from Ukraine the right to stay and work in the European Union for up to three years, and to social, medical and subsistence assistance for up to one year. The US also announced a relaxation of its deportation and work permit laws for Ukrainian citizens.

TV broadcasting in Ukraine is undergoing periodic disruptions, and some websites are also being temporarily crashed due to hacker attacks. In Russian-occupied Kherson, Ukrainian TV broadcasting has been completely turned off and replaced by Russian TV. In this city, the aggressors plan to organise a separatist rally, which Kyiv believes may be used to announce a so-called ‘Kherson People’s Republic’ (there are reports of ‘actors’ being brought in from occupied Crimea to this end). This could lead to clashes with the local population. The Ukrainian people’s protests against Russian aggression are continuing: on 3 March, between two and three thousand residents took to the streets in the town of Prymorsk in Zaporizhzhia oblast, succeeding in driving Russian troops out of the city.

Commentary

• The Ukrainian counterattack from the Volhynia region has not affected the course of the fighting near Kyiv so far. It should be assumed that too little force was used, and the Ukrainian army’s potential is too dispersed to execute an effective counter-attack. Nevertheless, in the newly-created Volhynia direction, the strengthening of Ukrainian forces will at least delay Russia’s moves to take Kyiv. It is an open question as to whether the reserve so far remaining in western Ukraine (and blocking a potential strike from the Brest oblast in Belarus) was included in the fighting because Kyiv was sure that a strike from Brest would not take place, or because the Ukrainian army saw no other way of preventing the Russians from completing their encirclement of the capital. The difficult situation is evidenced by the strengthening of the aggressor in the towns south of Kyiv on both sides of the Dnieper. However, the road through Vasylkiv to Bila Tserkva is still open.

• The fact that Russian troops advancing north-eastwards (in the Severia direction) have reached Kyiv, and their approach to the outskirts of Dnipro city (Slobodka direction), testifies to the breakdown of the defence lines in left-bank Ukraine. The Ukrainian defence is only effective at individual locations, and it should be assumed that there will be an attempt to withdraw at least some Ukrainian forces (mainly those units equipped with heavy weapons) to the right bank of the Dnieper. As in those areas in the north-east and south of the country which the Russians have so far occupied, most Ukrainian sub-units will remain within the enemy’s territory, and will gradually move to irregular activities. After the Ukrainian defence of the left-bank has been broken up, it is an open question as to whether the Russian attack will continue west of the Dnieper line. It should be considered highly probable that an air-sea landing operation near Odesa will be carried out, and that Russian forces will take steps to block Ukraine’s principal port, following the example of Mariupol and Mykolayiv. The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, on the other hand, have complete freedom to draw the main line of their subsequent attack either to the north (Kyiv) or to the north-west (Lviv).

• Ukrainian-Russian talks lasting several hours in Belarus did not bring any agreement that could herald an imminent ceasefire. The Russian side does not intend to cease combat operations until it achieves both the political goal – the unconditional surrender of the authorities in Kyiv; and the military one – the complete destruction of Ukraine’s military infrastructure. The Ukrainian side treats the consent to open humanitarian corridors as the greater necessity, in order to save the civilian population from the effects of terrorist attacks by the Russian army. The Russians see this as a trick to soften the criticism of the Kremlin for attacking civilians. After the populations have been evacuated, the Russian army will resume its attempts to conquer the besieged towns and cities.

• Despite the deteriorating situation and fears in Ukrainian society, there are still no signs of defeatism. What dominates is the outrage at the actions of the occupier, which are causing more and more victims and destruction, and full mobilisation to resist. In the cities of Western Ukraine (Lviv, Lutsk), new Territorial Defence (TD) brigades are being formed; fortifications are being built, trenches are being dug, and humanitarian aid is being collected. The population is cooperating with the army and the TD, and thousands of notifications about suspicious persons, transport, and plans for sabotage are being received. Ukrainian men keep returning to their country from abroad, ready to join the fight. Most of the supermarket chains are still operating, and the most important groceries are being supplied. However, the situation is becoming increasingly difficult in the cities besieged by the Russians, including in Mariupol, which is threatened by a humanitarian catastrophe as food supply channels have been blocked and electricity & water supplies have been cut.

• The takeover of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant has reduced its generation capacity to 12%, i.e. to around 700 MW. This may make it harder to meet the demand for electricity, although for the time being this is not a certainty; its consumption dropped sharply from the beginning of the invasion, because many industrial plants stopped working, thus freeing up demand. It is possible that in these circumstances the system operator will decide to disconnect the plant from the network.",https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2022-03-04/russias-attack-ukraine-day-8

The second round of Ukrainian-Russian negotiations



On March 3rd, another meeting of Ukrainian and Russian representatives has commenced in Belarus. Considering the rhetoric of high-ranking Russian officials on the eve of the meeting, no special progress is expected in resolving the issue of ending the war through diplomatic means during the talks.

Belarus threat



Belarusian troops are stationed in columns on the border with Ukraine ready to invade with the support of Russian troops, which have shown a significant slow-down in the pace of the offence.

Since information regarding the unexpected resistance by the Ukrainian Armed Forces to the aggressor keeps spreading in official channels in Belarus and on the Internet, there is a possibility that Belarusian servicemen will refuse to carry out criminal orders and put themselves in mortal danger considering the example of Russian Marines in Crimea. At the same time, the entry of the most morally and psychologically prepared units of the assault troops of the Republic of Belarus and individual units of other kinds of troops is not excluded.

The Status of the Strategic Deterrence Forces of the Russian Federation



The forces of strategic deterrence of the Russian Federation remain to continue to be on special duty regime by Putin’s order. It is considered as a continuation of nuclear intimidation as a part of the preparation for peace talks with Ukrainian officials and negotiations with representatives of the West.

Operational situation:



Kyiv

Efforts are still being made to create a semicircle around the capital from the north, west and east. The greatest danger now remains from the north and northwest of Kyiv (towns of Ivankiv, Vorzel, Bucha, Irpin, Hostomel). Intense battles continue the approaches to Kyiv at a distance of 10-40 km, in which the enemy loses equipment and personnel.

Major of Hostomel has been executed by Russians. In the west direction, the Armed Forces of Ukraine liberated and held the city of Makarov. Kyiv is well protected by its defense forces including Armed forces, Territorial defense, police etc. Kyiv is holding strongly with very strong capabilities. Situation in Kyiv is stable. Kyiv had experienced some airstrikes during last night, which all were blocked by its air defense.

Regional centers



The siege of Mariupol by the Russian occupants continues. There is continuous destruction of civilian infrastructure by artillery and MLRS fire. The city keeps resisting. At the same time, the city has no electric power and other basic utilities, it suffers from the lack of any living conditions and there are discussions now of setting up a corridor for civilians to leave. City has 400,000 inhabitants. A siege of Mariupol reminds some observers a blockade of Leningrad during WWII.

Russian troops are stationed in Kherson and control the city's main roads and facilities. At the end of the day they have announced that Kherson is occupied and some buses of people were transported from Crimea to “settle a new group of residents”.



Estimated losses of the enemy as of 20:00 03.03.

Tanks - more than 200 units,

Armoured combat vehicles of various types - more than 800 units,

Helicopters - more than 30,

Aircraft - more than 30,

Personnel - about 9,000 people.

Introduction of Martial Law in Russia

The Russian government plans to introduce country-wide martial law on March 4th. To this end, on

March 3rd, the Security Council of Russia held a session. The introduction of martial law will allow

preventing possible large aggregation of people at potential anti-war demonstrations and sanctionsrelated protests.

Also, martial law can help Russia carry out concealed mobilization to create

necessary reserves of troops to continue the war with Ukraine.

International relations



After an hour-and-a-half phone conversation between the President of Russia Vladimir Putin and

President of France Emmanuel Macron, the latter said that Putin “has not provided any assurances”,

and instead, given that Ukraine does not accede to his conditions, will go on with the military

intervention, and thus “the worst is to be expected”. That unfortunately means that at the moment we shall expect enhancement of air strikes, which would include attacks on Kyiv and some other major cities.

U.S. President Joe Biden submitted a request to Congress for an additional $10 billion of aid for

Ukraine and regions dealing with the consequences of Russian aggression.

Namely, $5 billion for emergency economic and food security, $30 million for integration with the European electricity network, as well as $91 million for strengthening sanctions, $59 million for the search of Russian

oligarchs’ property and $21 million for increasing export control restrictions.

Ukraine’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and U.S. Secretary of State discussed security assistance,

namely, strengthening Ukraine’s air defense capabilities in a telephone conversation.

On Friday, the Finnish president will make an unscheduled visit to the US, during which parties will discuss Russian aggression against Ukraine and its consequences for European security. Likely, parties will also talk about supplies of the newest weapons to Finland, including aircraft and missile rockets.

On March 4th, an extraordinary meeting of the North Atlantic Council is scheduled to take place on the level of Foreign Ministers, including heads of foreign affairs sections of Finland and Sweden, as well as an EU representative. Ukrainian Foreign Minister will take part in the event via video connection and will lobby the issue of supplying new air-defense systems to Ukraine.





A need for air defense systems (most important!)

Ukraine is in a serious need of air defense systems. A massive undertaking by many parties (including governments, experts, think tanks, activists, journalists and pressure groups, including our Centre) is advocating a provision of some enhanced air defense systems for Ukraine. It is clear that Ukraine is stronger on land despite Russian quantities of forces and brutal tactics, they are losing in most of operational directions.

They areas acquisitions are minimal considering capabilities invested and losses. (Losses of Russians are getting close to both Chechen wars combined). However, despite Russia still could not establish air superiority and loses a lot of forces from Ukrainian air attacks by combat aviation and T2 drones attacks, Ukraine’s air defense capabilities are the main shortage.

Commonly the western world needs to find an urgent solution to enhance Ukraine’s air defense. We call for all interested parties to help in resolving this critical matter.

What Putin wants now? And what can he do?

Putin’s whole operation was based on the one critical assumption – Russian ability to perform a quick “lightning” attack on Kyiv (supported by attacks in the East (Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy) and South (line between Kherson and Mariupol). The main idea was to quickly take Kyiv and capture and overthrow the government.

Only in this case the other elements of the campaign made sense, otherwise there would be no obvious operational gains, but more importantly no resources to successfully hold the acquired territories (apart from securing the access to Crimean channel and possibly a ‘land bridge’ to Crimea, which would be extremely difficult to hold if the rest of campaign fails).

Thus, the whole operation looked more like a raid, not the occupational full scale invasion. Since the reaching of the key goal (quick Kyiv takeover) has failed, the rest elements of operation do not hold together. There are examples, like shortages of fuel, disruption of other supplies, soldiers’ no knowledge of the mission shows that there has been no well worked out plan B.

Which is very strange since Russian planning (prior to this campaign) always had number of plans, which Russia could choose from.

The introduction of the tactic of bombing cities shows also the will of Putin not to go for real negotiations and win at all costs. But how do we define the winning? The biggest question is what is the political goal from the current operational plan? Putin clearly is not winning hearts and minds of people – after horrendous cases of destruction of the normal peaceful life, almost all Ukrainian population fiercely hate Russians.

Whatever is the final outcome of this operation, Putin is not going to bring Russia and Ukraine anywhere close. Two nations once friendly and historically/culturally/ethnically close are broken now for many years (or decades). Too many Russians consciously carry and express the guilt for what is happening. Lots are wondering why they need to lose their men in the needless and senseless war.

That is damaging Russian society from within. Putin’s continuous repeating of the ‘Nazi’ narrative, which makes no sense to anyone except his clique, obsession with Ukraine undertaking as a whole, his cold-blooded killings of civilians in strikes and armed attacks, ignorant today’s statement that the ‘operation is going in accordance with the plan’ and obsessive desire to continue no matter what, raises serious questions about his general rationality.

His personal emotional state and newly adopted lifestyle add to those questions.

Whatever happens, huge compensations are already due. Russia is now a pariah state for the whole democratic world and is being excluded from multiple commercial transactions. It becomes isolated from global social activities.

The recent UN General Council resolution demonstrates global condemnation. An unprecedented support of Ukraine movement around the world dominates in today’s agenda. Putin personally already alienated himself from the world, made up a massive case for war crimes tribunal, tremendously weakened its economy and humiliated the image of great Russian army.

Whatever the outcome of this war, those facts have already been established. That

puts lots of questions of the outcomes, which Putin can consider as a victory. Even if he declares some results as a victory, his losses are already far greater.

Putin has already become an unaffordable liability for majority of population and, importantly, for the country’s top elite, which enjoyed the decades of stability and money-making opportunities.

On Sunday, as Ukrainian refugees were milling near the entrance to the structure, calculating their odds of making it safely over the Irpin River, a family laden with backpacks and a blue roller suitcase decided to chance it.

10,3d6c6cb4-8fdd-4395-a4ab-429b3f15cb72,[],2022-03-05,"I write this with a loud airborne alert in Kyiv, but I don't leave to the shelter. Amazing how quickly people are used to the new danger – I hardly react to sirens unless I hear blasts nearby.

But people don't have that privilege in the northern outskirts of Kyiv, where my sister lives. Several small towns – Bucha, Irpen, Borodyanka, Vorzel, Hostomel – found themselves on the way chosen by the Russian army to get to the capital. There are no airborne warnings as no one needs them – otherwise, they would sound 24/7. Military helicopters and jets became new normal. A road to Kyiv passing by these towns is literally packed with damaged Russian tanks and armoured vehicles, so the new invader squads are paving the way through the residential area, indiscriminately shelling them.

But you will hardly find a sign of panic even there. Unbelievable, the prevailing feeling is determination.

According to the latest poll, the same is all over the country: 88% are sure that Ukraine will win this war, 98% support the Ukrainian army. Territorial self-defence forces are packed from day one. Even in predominately Russian-spoken regions, there are lines of volunteers willing to join the army to defend Ukraine from Russian aggression.

Putin's idea that Ukraine would capitulate was pure nonsense.

But let me share with you what I felt on February 24th 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine. It was a strong feeling of Déjà vu.

Back in 2013, on a cold early morning of November 30th, I was desperately knocking on the hotel door, waking up the EU diplomat staying there, to tell about shocking events in Kyiv. It was in Vilnius, right after the EU Eastern Partnership summit, where Ukrainian president Yanukovych refused to sign the Association agreement, perceived by many in Ukraine as a symbol of the European aspirations.

The reason for the refusal was in no way secret.

It had a name: Vladimir Putin.

Putin and Yanukovych agreed on a deal that included Ukraine's distancing from the EU. Yanukovych did what was promised. He's got his portion of humiliation in Vilnius and, upon return to Kyiv, decided to take out on pro-European students peacefully gathering at the central square of the Ukrainian capital. Those were encircled by pro-Yanukovych SWAT and severely beaten for no reason. Pure revenge.

This blew all over the country.

The EU diplomat whom I was knocking to was shocked to hear this, but then replied: ""Sergiy, I know what happens next. Ukrainian people will take Yanukovych down, his successor will sign the Association. But these times will not be easy"".

It turned out to be true. Ukraine has lost 100 lives during the Revolution of Dignity, sparked by these events. It was a price the nation paid for its European future.

And then came Putin.

He did what no Western capital expected. He occupied and annexed Crimea, occupied and destroyed industrial Donbas. A hybrid war against Ukraine took more than 13 thousand lives.

Russia ruined the world order back in 2014, not now. Not just Putin, it's Russia who did it.

Russian society has widely supported military actions in 2014 and backs bloody invasion in 2022. Putin's approval rating is just rising.

But Putin did not reach what he ultimately wanted.

Right the opposite: he united Ukraine towards Europe. We signed the Association, got visa liberalisation, implemented a list of reforms. The EU- and NATO support have rocketed and remained high throughout these years. Ukraine made the EU accession a national idea with no reciprocity from the EU.

One can say it's a dark joke that the fastest way to destroy the national idea is it wipe the nation.

But for Putin, it's not a joke at all.

In 2008 he first openly spoke at NATO Bucharest summit that he does not recognise a right for the Ukrainian nation to exit, and he repeats this year by year. These days and weeks, he passed from words to actions.

Let's not turn a blind eye that Europe did not understand that in 2014. But in 2022, the West is finally waking up.

And that's what my Déjà vu is about.

Of course, Ukraine will win the new war with Russia, the way we won the Revolution of Dignity. But that is not enough.

Like in 2014, we need to get from this crisis stronger. And we'll do that. I'm pretty sure that in 2022 the EU will recognise Ukraine as a candidate state and will start negotiation on accession.

It will open a long road with plenty of reforms needed, but that will be our job. And we will do that. Just give us a chance.

You need it the same way as we do. It is the only way to stop Putin.

The goal of Putin's actions in Ukraine is to prevent us from joining the EU and NATO. He won't stop harming Ukraine and destroying European security until we get there.

The sooner the EU will realise this – the better for Europe.

At long last, we deserve it.

Ukrainians have proved by deeds that we are Europeans. We are the only nation fighting for its European future!

Last but not least: Ukrainian integration to the EU can change the ugly Russia we see now. There is no better way to prove to Russian people that democratisation leads to prosperity than showing it in the Ukrainian example.

Democracy can be contagious in the post-Soviet space. Ukraine is a clue for that.
