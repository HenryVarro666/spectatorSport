1,ed55c7b4-cac1-45c7-bc3f-7a89b5bec787,[],2022-03-04,"WASHINGTON (WCSC) - United States Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said the Russian people were the only ones who could fix the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine Thursday night.

In a tweet, Graham asked if there was a “Brutus in Russia” or a “more successful Colonel Stauffenberg in the Russian military.”

“The only way this ends is for somebody in Russia to take this guy out,” Graham said in the tweet. “You would be doing your country - and the world - a great service.”

Graham went on to say the only people who could fix the situation between Russia and Ukraine were the Russian people. Noting it was “easy to say, hard to do.”

“Unless you want to live in darkness for the rest of your life, be isolated from the rest of the world in abject poverty, and live in darkness you need to step up to the plate,” Graham tweeted.

The tweets come after Graham introduced a resolution condemning the Russian leader, the Russian Federation and Russian military commanders for “committing flagrant acts of aggression and atrocities rising to the level of war crimes against humanity.”

“The world has let him get away from too much for too long. He has stolen the Russian people blind,” said Graham on Wednesday. “To the Russian people, our fight is not with you. You’re a victim of Putin... in bringing justice to the table, the Russian people have to suffer.”

Is there a Brutus in Russia? Is there a more successful Colonel Stauffenberg in the Russian military?

2,ed55c7b4-cac1-45c7-bc3f-7a89b5bec787,"['Joan E Greve', 'Vivian Ho']",2022-03-04,"Lindsey Graham has attracted widespread condemnation after the South Carolina senator suggested Vladimir Putin should be assassinated in order to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Graham first made the suggestion in an appearance on Fox News host Sean Hannity’s show on Thursday evening, and he then repeated the idea in a tweet that quickly went viral.

“Is there a Brutus in Russia? Is there a more successful Colonel Stauffenberg in the Russian military? The only way this ends is for somebody in Russia to take this guy out,” Graham said on Twitter. “You would be doing your country – and the world – a great service.”

Brutus refers to one of the assassins of the Roman emperor Julius Caesar, and Stauffenberg was a German army officer who was executed for attempting to kill Adolf Hitler in 1944.

Graham added in a separate tweet: “The only people who can fix this are the Russian people. Easy to say, hard to do. Unless you want to live in darkness for the rest of your life, be isolated from the rest of the world in abject poverty, and live in darkness you need to step up to the plate.”

Despite immediate criticism of Graham’s comments from left and right in the US, he doubled down on the idea in a Friday morning interview with Fox & Friends. “I’m hoping somebody in Russia will understand that he is destroying Russia, and you need to take this guy out by any means possible,” Graham said.

Russian officials also attacked Graham’s comments as “criminal” and demanded that the US government provide an explanation for his rhetoric.

“The degree of Russophobia and hatred in the United States towards Russia is off the scale,” the Russian ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, said in a Facebook post. “It is impossible to believe that a senator of a country that promotes its moral values as a ‘guiding star’ for all mankind could afford to call for terrorism as a way to achieve Washington’s goals in the international arena.”

American lawmakers of both parties responded to Graham’s comments with shock, dismay and outrage, pointing out the danger in demanding the assassination of a leader whose troops are currently engaged in shelling nuclear plants.

“I really wish our members of Congress would cool it and regulate their remarks as the administration works to avoid [a third world war],” the progressive congresswoman Ilhan Omar said in a tweet. “As the world pays attention to how the US and [its] leaders are responding, Lindsey’s remarks and remarks made by some House members aren’t helpful.”

The Democratic senator Brian Schatz added, “I have seen at least a half a dozen insane tweets tonight. Please everyone keep your wits about you.”

As the world pays attention to how the US and it’s leaders are responding, Lindsey’s remarks and remarks made by some House members aren’t helpful. — Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) March 4, 2022

Republican members of Congress were no less critical, as Senator Ted Cruz derided Graham’s suggestion as “an exceptionally bad idea”. “Use massive economic sanctions; BOYCOTT Russian oil [and] gas; and provide military aid so the Ukrainians can defend themselves,” Cruz said. “But we should not be calling for the assassination of heads of state.”

Even Marjorie Taylor Greene – the extremist congresswoman who has sparked outrage for, among other things, comparing coronavirus-related restrictions to the treatment of Jewish people during the Holocaust – chimed in from the right with criticism of Graham.

“While we are all praying for peace [and] for the people of Ukraine, this is irresponsible, dangerous [and] unhinged. We need leaders with calm minds [and] steady wisdom,” Greene said on Twitter. “Not blood thirsty warmongering politicians trying to tweet tough by demanding assassinations. Americans don’t want war.”

Experts in Russian politics argued that Graham’s suggestion was not only irresponsible but also unrealistic. Bill Browder, the financier whose work against Russian corruption led to the Magnitsky Act of 2012, described Putin as “probably the most paranoid man in the world”.

“He’s a very little man. He’s very scared of everybody, and he’s very vindictive. And so he’s constantly looking around for betrayal,” Browder told CNN on Friday. “I don’t think that there’s going to be a palace coup because he’s looking to try to stop it.”

At the daily White House media briefing, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said: “We are not advocating for killing the leader of a foreign country or regime change. That is not the policy of the United States.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/04/lindsey-graham-suggests-putin-assassination-russia-ukraine?CMP=twt_gu&utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium

“How does this end? Somebody in Russia has to step up to the plate… and take this guy out,” the senator told conservative Fox News TV host Sean Hannity.

He repeated the call later in a series of tweets, saying “the only people who can fix this are the Russian people.”

“Is there a Brutus in Russia?” asked the senator, referring to one of Roman ruler Julius Caesar’s assassins.

Graham also wondered if “a more successful Colonel Stauffenberg” existed in the Russian military, alluding to the German officer whose bomb failed to kill Adolf Hitler in 1944.

“You would be doing your country — and the world — a great service,” he added.

The senator, who has served in Congress for over twenty years and has at times been a close ally to former president Donald Trump, had earlier in the day introduced a resolution condemning the Russian president and his military commanders for committing “war crimes” and “crimes against humanity.”

The White House on Friday rejected Graham’s call for an assassination.

“That is not the position of the United States government and certainly not a statement you’d hear from come from the mouth of anybody working in this administration,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at the daily briefing.

Members of Congress also criticized Graham’s tweets as reckless, including members of his own party.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) said, “This is an exceptionally bad idea.” Sanctions and boycotts of Russian oil and gas are solutions, along with military aid for the Ukrainians, Cruz said.

“But we should not be calling for the assassination of heads of state,” he added.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) called Graham’s remarks “dangerous” and “unhinged.”

While we are all praying for peace & for the people of Ukraine, this is irresponsible, dangerous & unhinged.



We need leaders with calm minds & steady wisdom.

“We need leaders with calm minds & steady wisdom,” she wrote. “Not blood thirsty warmongering politicians trying to tweet tough by demanding assassinations.”

Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) said calls for Putin’s assassination from U.S. politicians “aren’t helpful.”

“I really wish our members of Congress would cool it and regulate their remarks as the administration works to avoid WWIII,” Omar tweeted. “As the world pays attention to how the US and [its] leaders are responding.”

Norman Eisen, who served as U.S. ambassador to the Czech Republic during the Obama administration, said such comments would only raise tensions.

“Now Putin can say ‘one of the most senior U.S. Senators has called for my assassination,’ ” Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said. “Why would you want to help him?”

Graham spokesman Kevin Bishop said the senator “also expressed he was okay with a coup to remove Putin.”

“Basic point, Putin has to go,” Bishop said. “He also noted it will be — has to be — the Russian people who do it.”

Some online critics questioned whether the senator’s tweets violated Twitter’s rules against violence. Twitter did not respond to a request for comment from The Washington Post late Thursday.

Graham, a retired Air Force prosecutor, has long been critical of Putin. Once an influential member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Graham in 2016 accused Russia of hacking his campaign email account, CNN reported. He said Russia was “trying to destabilize democracy all over the world. Not just here,” according to the outlet.

Graham also called for Russians to assassinate Putin during a Thursday appearance on “Hannity” on Fox News. Moreover, he introduced legislation this week calling for Putin to be investigated for war crimes.

On Wednesday, Sean Hannity suggested on his radio show that the United States carry out an assassination of Putin, saying, “You cut the head of the snake off, and you kill the snake.” Experts told The Post that such a move would not help solve the crisis, and it would be illegal outside an armed conflict with Russia.

Sen. Lindsey Graham's suggestion that Russians should assassinate President Vladimir Putin has drawn the ire of Republicans and Democrats concerned over the war in Ukraine.

""Is there a Brutus in Russia? Is there a more successful Colonel Stauffenberg in the Russian military?"" the South Carolina Republican asked in a tweet.

Roman Emperor Julius Caesar was assassinated by Brutus and others in the Rome Senate on the Ides of March. Graham was also referring to German Lt. Col. Claus von Stauffenberg, who tried to kill Adolf Hitler in the summer of 1944.

""The only way this ends is for somebody in Russia to take this guy out. You would be doing your country - and the world - a great service,"" Graham said.

Asked about the remarks during the White House news briefing on Friday afternoon, press secretary Jen Psaki said, ""That is not the position of the United States government and certainly not a statement you'd hear come from the mouth of anybody working in this administration.""

Among lawmakers concerned over Graham's suggestion were Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas.

""I really wish our members of Congress would cool it and regulate their remarks as the administration works to avoid WWlll. As the world pays attention to how the US and it's leaders are responding, Lindsey's remarks and remarks made by some House members aren't helpful,"" Omar tweeted.

""This is an exceptionally bad idea,"" Cruz tweeted in response to Graham's remarks. ""Use massive economic sanctions; BOYCOTT Russian oil & gas; and provide military aid so the Ukrainians can defend themselves. But we should not be calling for the assassination of heads of state.""

Graham made similar remarks on television Thursday night.

Assassination during military conflict is specifically forbidden by the Lieber Code, which President Abraham Lincoln issued as a general order for U.S. forces in 1863.

Section IX of the code states that the laws of war forbid declaring a member of a hostile force or a citizen or subject of a hostile government to be an outlaw ""who may be slain without trial.""

""Civilized nations look with horror upon offers of rewards for the assassination of enemies as relapses into barbarism,"" according to the Lieber Code, which underpins international conventions on warfare.

Graham's remarks drew wide attention and criticism. In response, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's office said he believes Putin should be held responsible for any war crimes committed, citing an investigation by the International Criminal Court.

The senator's communications director, Kevin Bishop, sought to clarify his comments.

Graham ""also expressed he was okay with a coup to remove Putin as well,"" Bishop said. ""Basic point, Putin has to go,"" he said, adding that the Russian people should find the ""off ramp"" to the international crisis.

Sen. Lindsey Graham has called for the Julius Caesar-style assassination of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""Is there a Brutus in Russia? Is there a more successful Colonel Stauffenberg in the Russian military?"" Graham tweeted on March 4.

Graham was referring to Brutus, a historical figure who assassinated Julius Caesar, and Claus von Stauffenberg, an army officer who tried and failed to kill Adolf Hitler.

""The only way this ends is for somebody in Russia to take this guy out. You would be doing your country — and the world — a great service,"" Graham tweeted.

In a separate tweet in the same Twitter chain on March 4, Graham said ""the only people who can fix this are the Russian people,"" referencing his calls for Putin's assassination.

""Easy to say, hard to do. Unless you want to live in darkness for the rest of your life, be isolated from the rest of the world in abject poverty, and live in darkness you need to step up to the plate,"" Graham said.

Graham is not the first conservative American figure to call for Putin's assassination in the week since Russia launched an unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. Fox News host Sean Hannity floated the idea that Putin should be assassinated during a March 2 episode of his podcast, ""The Sean Hannity Show.""

Some Russians, too, have advocated for a regime change in their homeland. Businessman and US-based crypto investor Alex Konanykhin put a $1 million bounty on Putin's head this week, calling for military officers to arrest him as a war criminal.
