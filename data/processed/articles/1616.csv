I had to check the date on last night’s updates (here and here), because just like Thursday, Russian troops were bogged down with little progress on Friday. They’re simply “stalemated” all around. We’ve talked about why Russia is stalemated and why it is unlikely to right the ship. But last night’s recap from the Institute of War really underscored much of what we've been talking about. So let me hone in on some key passages.

Russian operations around Kyiv remained largely stalled over the past 24 hours and Russian forces conducted another pause to resupply and refit frontline units.

Russia has been “paused” around Kyiv for two weeks now. There was some lame-ass efforts to push through on Wednesday, but the scope of the incursions (small detachments) didn’t suggest the kind of effort that would require a whole 48 hours breather to resupply. If those 200-300 men assaults (against a city of nearly 3 million) winded the Russians, then they are even weaker than anyone thought. Indeed, ISW concludes, “The apparent need of Russian forces to conduct another operational pause after failed attacks on March 8-9 supports the Ukrainian General Staff assessments that Russian forces have far less effective combat power around the capital than their numbers would suggest.”

Honestly, I don’t know why Russia is bothering. Probably because Putin is screaming at his generals to “do something,” and this is what happens when people “do something” without thinking through the consequences.

Russian forces did not secure any new territory in northeastern Ukraine and may be redeploying forces attacking eastern Kyiv to defend against Ukrainian counterattacks in Sumy Oblast.

Woah, this is amazing. If we were to have an MVP contest in Ukraine, Sumy would definitely be a contender. Remember the map I’ve been showing the last few days:

Credit @warmapper on Twitter, which I just noticed has been suspended by Twitter. Sucks, because his were the best maps.

That tendril from Sumy to Kyiv is over 200 miles long, and it has been absolutely mauled by Ukrainian territorial defense forces (basically, local militia).

x Ukrainian police and Territorial Defense unit detained a dozen of servicemen near Romny, #Sumy Region #Ukraine #UkraineRussiaWar pic.twitter.com/w3NMV0nvhK — MilitaryLand.net (@Militarylandnet) March 11, 2022

More here, here, here and here. It’s hard to see, but Romny is literally smack dab in the center of that long tendril between Sumy and Kyiv. So yes, the map says that road is under Russian “control,” but lol, no, it’s not. You don’t take prisoners in enemy-controlled territory. Amazingly, this isn’t even Ukrainian army, but a bunch of civilians with the most basic military training! And the reason this 200+ mile road is easy pickings for Ukrainian irregulars is because Russia can’t subdue a city that is quite literally on its border, and has been shelled relentlessly from across that border since the start of the war.

And things are so bad for Russia, that they have to pull troops off the siege of Kyiv in order to shore up those supply lines—tying up desperately needed manpower and using up even more supplies (fuel, parts, ammo) that It already lacks.

Russian forces did not conduct any direct assaults on Kharkiv City on March 11, instead pausing to reconstitute their forces [...] The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian units attacking Kharkiv are increasingly using Russian reservists.

Let’s look at that map again. You can see a long road southeast of Kharkiv that leads to Kyiv, and another that heads south. If Russia punched its way through, it could both bolster the assault on Kyiv from yet another side, further encircling Kyiv, and/or it could head south and cut off Ukrainian forces holding strong against the eastern Donbas axis, or it could head up the border and assist with the siege of Sumy. Instead, Russia is stuck there, unable to take a town right on the Mighty Russia border. Definitely an MVP candidate!

Russian forces remain pinned down attempting to reduce Mariupol by siege and bombardment.

Mariupol has had more lives than any cat, deep into hostile territory.

Mariupol is particularly sore spot for Russians, since they thought it should’ve ended within the separatist Donbas region, but it fought those assholes out. And now, going on week three, it is still holding out, with separatists in the north, and Russian army and marines from Crimea. We see that pocket of Ukrainian-held territory, and my fantasy would be for Ukraine to punch through the siege, resupply its defenders, and get at least some of its starving civilians out. No idea if Ukraine has that kind of resources available. But as is, that’s a big chunk of the Russia and separatist soldiers stuck laying siege on a city that was reported fallen several times, including on day one. Without a free Mariupol, Russian could head north and again, cut off Ukrainian forces defending the Donbas axis. Another MVP candidate.

Ukrainian forces halted Russian advances north and west from Crimea as Russian forces face growing supply and morale issues.

That’s over a dozen lines of attack, diluting Russian firepower and creating impossible logistical challenges.

Russia’s biggest successes have been in the south, where terrain is flat and dry and desert like, without thick forests for cover, and mud isn’t an issue. But as mentioned before, Russia’s attack has splintered into a veritable octopus.

Russia is stuck everywhere, but it’s particularly noteworthy on that left tendril, as that’s on the Southern Bug river, the gateway to the key port city of Odesa.

Ukraine has blown bridges, forcing it to have to go through either Mykolaiv, a city of nearly half a million, or way further north, through Voznesensk, further stretching its strained supply lines and giving territorial defenders more opportunities for mischief.

Last night, Russia’s first effort to enter Mykolaiv was repulsed by the city’s defenders. The city’s mayor, or Korean descent, is becoming a bit of a national legend, and some are even talking about him being president someday. MVP status? Not quite yet, it hasn’t faced the sustained assault of Kharkiv, Sumy, and Mariupol. But it is becoming just as important a front in this war.

Of course, it’s not all celebratory news. Civilians are dying at horrifying rates, as Russia takes out its frustrations on civilian infrastructure. And brave Ukrainian defenders and hapless Russian conscripts are also paying the ultimate price. But every day Russia is bogged down militarily is one day closer to the end of this nightmare, and that’s worth at least a little celebrating. And really, the MVP is the collective Ukrainian people, from its army, to its territorial defense force, to its leadership, keeping people motivated, to all the civilians that are not just surviving unimaginable conditions, but are aiding in the war effort by building fortifications, feeding defenders, helping repair equipment, cleaning up after bombardments, manning hospitals and clinics, and keeping supply lines running.",https://www.dailykos.com/story/2022/3/11/2085420/-Ukraine-update-Sumy-is-Ukraine-s-MVP-Or-maybe-it-s-Kharkiv-Or-is-it-Mariupol

Today, March 11, is the 16th day of the Russian military attack on Ukraine. We're telling about all the current events. The article will be constantly updated.

What is today?

Key points.

Operational information as of the morning of March 11, 2022.

In the Polissia direction , the enemy is trying to break through the defenses of Ukraine's defenders in the areas of Poliske, Kukhari, Zhovtneve, Andriivka, Kopyliv, Motyzhyn, Buzova, Horenychi, Bucha, Demydiv, and block Kyiv.

In the Siverskyi direction , the enemy was stopped while trying to break through the defense of Chernihiv. Further movement of the enemy in the direction of Brovary from the east is not riled out.

In the Kharkiv direction , the enemy continues unsuccessful attempts to blockade the city from the north. Rifle regiments formed at the expense of Russian reservists were involved in the fighting in the Kharkiv region.

In the Donetsk and Tavria directions , the occupiers are concentrating their efforts on capturing the Ukrainian cities of Mariupol and Severodonetsk.

In the Pivdennyi Buh direction , the occupiers tried to gain control of Mykolaiv and develop an offensive in the directions of Zaporizhzhia and Kryvyi Rih. The Russian occupiers were stopped, demoralized, and suffered heavy losses.

In the Kherson region in the temporarily occupied settlements, the enemy is trying to establish an administrative-police regime.

The aggressor's losses are growing!

The EU Council recognized Russia's ""special operation"" in Ukraine as war and called Belarus an accomplice. The EU promises to further increase sanctions on Russia and Belarus.

The Russian Armed Forces have launched 775 missiles of ""all colors and all types"" since the invasion of Ukraine, a senior US State Department official told CNN.

The seized $415 billion of Russia's reserves will be used to compensate Ukraine: the Cabinet of Ministers and other governments are looking for a mechanism to transfer to Ukraine the seized gold and foreign exchange reserves of the Central Bank, said First Deputy Economy Minister Denys Kudin.

15:00 – We have already reached a strategic turning point. We are moving towards our victory. The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is sure.

A little later, Zelenskyy spoke with the President of Finland and discussed the prospects of peace talks, and thanked them for the support.

The Armed Forces managed to eliminate Major General Andrey Kolesnikov, commander of the 29th Army of the Eastern Military District of the Russian Federation. Another dead Russian general.

The President also thanked our nearest neighbor, Poland. ""Already on the first day of the war, it became clear that there are no borders between us, between our peoples,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a speech to the Polish Sejm via video.

The Armed Forces managed to eliminate Major General Andrey Kolesnikov, commander of the 29th Army of the Eastern Military District of the Russian Federation. This is the third dead Russian general.

Ukraine is ready for Belarus to join the war. It is better for Belarusians to stay at home. Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Oleksiy Danilov stated this on a joint air of TV channels on March 11.

1,000 residents of Hostomel arrived in Bilohorodka. First aid is provided in the city. Further logistics to Kyiv and, if necessary, to the West of the country are provided.

20:00 – the Russian occupiers disrupted the evacuation from Izium; because of the shelling, the ""green corridor"" was not launched. The city was left without electricity, heat, water, communications.

A free transfer from Odesa to Moldova will be organized on March 12. This was reported in the press service of the Odesa regional organization of the Red Cross of Ukraine.

Chemical and biological threat

Russian media report that Russia has invited a meeting of the UN Security Council on US military-biological programs in Ukraine.

The President of Ukraine has already said in this regard: ""I am the President of an adequate country and an adequate people. And the father of two children. No chemical or any other weapons of mass destruction have been developed on my land. The entire world knows this. And if Russia does something similar against us, it will receive the harshest sanctions response,"" Zelenskyy promised in his address.

On March 8, graduates of the Moscow State University's bio faculty refuted their country's fake statement about ""biological weapons"" in Ukraine. ""The list of destroyed strains published by RIA Novosti and other Russian media outlets does not include any that are particularly dangerous. The list includes only strains common to microbiological and even epidemiological laboratories. General Konashenkov's statement about the existence of documented strains of 'plague, anthrax, tularemia, cholera' is pure fiction. The absolutely wild idea of ​​the existence of a special 'DNA of the Slavs, against whom special biological weapons were to be used,' according to Russian media, is a delusion for anyone who has studied a school biology course.

Such statements resonate with the theories of the German National Socialists with their cult of the 'Aryan higher race.' We demand to stop false statements about allegedly found evidence of the development of biological weapons in Ukrainian laboratories.""

Meanwhile, the WHO recommends that Ukraine destroy high-risk pathogens in medical laboratories to prevent spills.

Nuclear energy and facilities

Ukraine completely refuses to purchase Russian nuclear fuel, Energoatom says.

The nuclear subcritical unit, Neutron Source, which is located in the Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology in Piatyhatki, was blacked out as a result of shelling by Russian troops, according to the State Inspectorate for Nuclear Regulation of Ukraine.

It is impossible to deliver spare parts, equipment, and specialized personnel to the Zaporizhzhia NPP, which was captured by the Russians, to carry out scheduled repairs. Maintenance of Unit 1 has been reduced to the minimum allowable level, said IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi.

Importantly! According to available information, Putin ordered the preparation of a terrorist attack at the Chornobyl nuclear power plant. The Defense Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warns about it.

In the Russian-controlled Chornobyl nuclear power plant, Russian troops plan to create a man-made catastrophe, for which the occupiers will try to shift responsibility to Ukraine. Currently, the Chornobyl nuclear power plant is completely disconnected from the monitoring systems of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The station is blacked out. The service life of the available diesel generators is designed for 48 hours of maintenance of safety systems.

The occupiers refuse to grant access to the station to Ukrainian repairmen. Instead, ""Belarusian specialists"" went there on the instructions of Aleksandr Lukashenko. Among them, under the guise of nuclear power plants, Russian saboteurs also come to organize a terrorist attack.

To imitate the involvement of the Ukrainian military in the Chornobyl accident, the occupiers are trying to create fake ""evidence"" to confirm their version. In particular, Russian car refrigerators collecting the bodies of dead Ukrainian defenders were spotted near the Antonov airport in Hostomel. There is a possibility that they will be played off as saboteurs in the Chornobyl zone.

18:00 – Chornobyl NPP managed to provide an additional supply of diesel fuel for power plants that provide emergency power supply to spent nuclear fuel storage facilities, according to the State Inspectorate for Nuclear Regulation. Attempts are being made to restore the station's external power supply.

22:00 – Russian fascists use Zaporizhzhia NPP as a military base, Energoatom states.

Who's coming to Ukraine?

About financial aid, weapons, and volunteer fighters

Forty Republican senators are demanding that the Biden administration allow the transfer of Polish MiG-29 fighters to Ukraine.

The US Senate approved the allocation of $13.6 million to help Ukraine. About half of this amount is spent on arming and equipping Ukraine, as well as the Pentagon's spending on sending US troops to other Eastern European countries. The rest of the money should go to humanitarian and economic aid, strengthening Allied defenses in the region, and protecting their energy and cybersecurity needs. The bill has now been submitted to President Joe Biden for signature.

American actress Mila Kunis and her husband and actor Ashton Kutcher raised $20 million for Ukrainians in a week.

""Thank you to everyone who helped us raise $20 million in less than a week. We can do it. We can hit our target. Together. Because we are with Ukraine,"" Kutcher wrote on social media.

Kazakhstan has sent 40 tons of humanitarian aid to Ukraine.

Ukraine's accession to the EU

Today, March 11, will be a crucial moment for the future of Ukraine and the future of the entirety of Europe. The heads of state must discuss Ukraine's request for quick accession to the European Union and announce a decision!

""EU leaders have said 'YES' to Ukraine's European integration. The process has begun. Now it depends on us and Ukrainians how quickly we will complete it. The heroic Ukrainian people deserve to know that the EU is happy to have them,"" the Lithuanian president wrote.

A rally in support of Ukraine will begin at 11:00 near the Palace of Versailles in France.

The EU Council supported Ukraine's application to join the EU and asks the European Commission to consider this issue immediately. The European Council has agreed in principle to our membership and the green light to start the accession process. Unfortunately, there is no ""accelerated"" procedure for joining the EU for Ukraine, although many have already written about it. The Chancellor of Germany and the Prime Minister of the Netherlands have already spoken publicly about the impossibility of such a procedure. But even without it, Ukraine has never been so close to joining the EU.

Ukraine's membership in the EU remains a matter of time and no more.

Foreign Minister Kuleba is convinced that Ukraine will 100% join the ranks of the European Union.

News from abroad

In Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, an unknown object fell from the sky, the sound of an explosion was heard. Specialists inspected the crash site and found a funnel and two parachutes.

The Czech Republic wants to equate the sign of the Russian occupiers ""Z"" to Nazi symbols

NATO understands Ukraine's frustration with the alliance's reluctance to close the skies, but the escalation will lead to casualties and suffering outside the country, said NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg. Disappointment is an understatement, to put it mildly; we really don't understand why real victims among Ukrainians cost less than European ones would be.

As a sign of solidarity with Ukraine, the Scots registered a new tartan. Tartan is a traditional Scottish ornament. There are many variations of this fabric. The new type was named ""Ukraine forever."" Tartan is one of the symbols of Scotland.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has expressed confidence that if Russia were punished for Crimea in 2014, there could be no war against Ukraine in 2022: ""Insufficient reaction of the world community to Russia's occupation of Crimea in 2014 led to Russia's current aggression against Ukraine. If the whole West and the whole world raised their voices against the invasion of Crimea in 2014, would we face today's situation?""

More sanctions against the aggressor!

At least 120,000 Russians will become unemployed after the departure of Western companies from Russia.

The United States has decided to abolish trade preferences for Russians. This decision was supported by the G7 and the EU. This means that all Russian goods will be sold at a high duty, they will cease to be competitive in the market.

Also, the possibility of receiving funds from the IMF and other financial institutions will be blocked. Personal sanctions are being imposed on State Duma deputies and bank heads.

In addition, the United States has banned the import of alcohol, diamonds, and seafood from Russia. Be very careful, because where there's ""vodka and herring,"" there's Russia.

And Joe Biden signed a decree banning the import of US dollar bills from the US to Russia.

19:30 – YouTube immediately begins blocking Russian state media channels around the world. Blocked First Channel, Channel 5, NTV, TNT, RT, Russia 1, Russia 24, Moscow 24, 60 minutes.

And the Venezuelan parliament says it could begin oil supplies to the United States and Europe in the middle of the year if sanctions are lifted.

Musicians distance themselves from the aggressor: Pink Floyd and David Gilmore remove their music from digital platforms in Russia and Belarus.

""As of today, in solidarity with the global protest against Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Pink Floyd's work since 1987 and David Gilmore's solo recordings will be removed from all digital platforms in Russia and Belarus,"" the statement said.

What's in Russia?

In the Rostov region, correctional colonies are continuing to work with prisoners with a proposal to join the occupying forces in exchange for an amnesty. They are ready to accept anyone to the armed forces of the Russian Federation, even those who have no experience of military service.

The Kremlin has said that a meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin is possible.

Russian officials, including Defense Minister Shoigu, have announced the urgent recruitment of 16,000 ex-ISIS fighters for use against Ukrainian civilians.

Putin began to blame those for the ""Ukrainian direction."" According to Medusa, the leadership of the 5th FSB service was placed under house arrest.

Russians complain that they have been treated badly in Georgia and people there don't want to lease apartments to them. Ukrainians advise them to come to Kharkiv or Mariupol. ""We will find you the best apartments in the houses destroyed by your compatriots. You will like it.""

What can we hear about Belarusians?

Aleksandr Lukashenko flew to Moscow for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss, in particular, the war in Ukraine.

While the mustached man is voyaging, banks in Belarus refuse to accept Russian rubles. And in some Belarusian currency exchange offices, the purchase of Russian money has stopped altogether.

At a meeting with Putin, Lukashenko said that ""by the end of the year, people will forget about the conflict in Ukraine."" Don't even hope. Nobody will forget anything, neither Mariupol, nor Kharkiv, nor Kyiv region. Neither millions of refugees nor thousands, killed and wounded by the criminal racist regime.

WARNING! Provocation!

At 2.30 pm Russian planes took off from Dubrovytsia airfield (Belarus), entered the territory of Ukraine, turned over our Horodychi and Tumen, after which they inflicted a fire on the settlement of Kopani (Belarus). Now the 9th Border Detachment is watching the occupation of this settlement by the enemy! The goal is to involve the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus in the war with Ukraine!"" the statement of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

Earlier, Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov warned the Belarusian people on his Facebook page about possible provocations and assured Ukraine of non-involvement: ""I guarantee that the Ukrainian army has not planned, does not plan and will not plan any aggressive actions against Belarus. Don't let your country get involved in this war! Don't let the Kremlin destroy the future of Belarus!""

The command of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine also reported the shelling of the settlements of Bukhlychi and Verkhniy Terebezhiv in Belarus.

And all this immediately after the meeting between Putin and Lukashenko! So what did they really agree on? Did the President of Belarus himself approve of the bombing of his country?

Social media

Facebook has decided to temporarily allow death calls and obscene remarks against the Russian military, Putin and Lukashenko. This innovation will apply to users from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, and Ukraine.

However, social media will block offensive posts about Russian civilians.

To which Peskov has already stated: ""Moscow will take the most decisive measures if Facebook and Instagram do not block calls for violence against Russia.""

And here are the ""decisive measures"": the Prosecutor General's Office demands to block Instagram in Russia, and to recognize the company Meta, which owns the service, as an ""extremist organization."" The Investigative Committee also announced the initiation of a criminal case against Meta employees.

And Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkēvičs suggested that Western social media delete the accounts of Russian authorities and propaganda media.
