2:30 a.m.: The United Nations will face three resolutions Wednesday on the worsening humanitarian situation in Ukraine after Russia decided to call for a vote on its Security Council resolution that makes no mention of its attack on its smaller neighbor, The Associated Press reported.

The General Assembly is scheduled to start considering two rival resolutions Wednesday morning — one supported by Ukraine and Western nations that makes clear Russia is responsible for the escalating humanitarian crisis and the other sponsored by South Africa that doesn't mention Russia. The Security Council will vote on the third resolution, which is sponsored by Russia and widely criticized for not referring to its invasion of Ukraine, the AP reports.

1:30 a.m.: U.S. President Joe Biden is set to announce new sanctions against Russia on Thursday as well as longer-term adjustments to NATO’s force posture in Europe. While in Brussels, Biden will also meet with G-7 and European Union leaders before traveling to Poland.

U.S. officials warn that the situation could worsen as Moscow grows increasingly frustrated and targets civilians. VOA’s national security correspondent Jeff Seldin has the story.

1:15 a.m.: In an interview on CNN, Dmitry Peskov, the press secretary for the Kremlin, refused to take the use of nuclear weapons off the table in the war with Ukraine saying they could be used “if it is an existential threat for our country.”

Peskov also claimed that the “special military operation” was going as planned. He said it is being conducted “strictly in accordance with the plans and the purposes that were established beforehand.” He conceded, however, that Russia has not yet achieved its goals in Ukraine which we described as: to “get rid of the military potential of Ukraine,"" to ensure Ukraine is a “neutral country,” to get rid of “nationalist battalions,” and for Ukraine to accept that Crimea is part of Russia and its two breakaway regions are independent states. The interview was conducted by CNN’s Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday.

12:30 a.m.: Ukrainian authorities said late Tuesday that Russians have “illegally seized the newest laboratory” at the Chernobyl nuclear power. The laboratory is responsible for improving the management of radioactive waste, the State Agency of Ukraine for Exclusion Zone Management said in a statement posted on Facebook. It processes radioactive waste and contains “highly active samples and samples of radionuclides.” These materials are “in the hands of the enemy” the State Agency said.

12 a.m.: On Wednesday, U.S. President Joe Biden heads to Brussels and Warsaw to coordinate with Western allies on the next phase of military, economic and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. VOA’s White House Bureau chief Patsy Widakuswara has this report, narrated by correspondent Anita Powell from Brussels.

We've come out of a dark period of ugly political division and tragic medical crisis and we are longing for something good to believe in.

Forty-four million brave Ukrainians seem to have risen to the challenge and given us cause for hope in the power of the underdog.

We root for them. We are amazed by their resilience. We long for them to survive and stay free. So it's understandable that we may fall victim to what one analyst eloquently described as Western wishful thinking.

After the invasion one US senator told me confidently that whatever happened, the Ukrainian people would be free. It was the optimism I've come to expect, and appreciate, from US politicians. And we hope it will be true.

History reminds us, however, that good doesn't always prevail. Not against Russia anyway.

Ask the Syrians, still stuck under the boot of the Assad regime, their cities destroyed by Russian bombs. Ask the Chechens, who saw their capital flattened on the orders of Vladimir Putin.

The Ukrainians' success depends on two things, their own phenomenal courage, and, just as critical, the steady supply of military hardware that it's getting from Western countries.

If those countries, or the public in those countries, start for a moment to think David has beaten Goliath then the flow of weapons could slow or stop. That would be catastrophic for the Ukrainian resistance.
