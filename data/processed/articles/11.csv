British foreign secretary to visit Poland, call for tougher sanctions on Russia British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss will visit Poland on Monday to call for tougher sanctions on Russia, her office said, as major western countries work together to ramp up the pressure on President Vladimir Putin and end the conflict in Ukraine. ""Putin is yet to show he is serious about diplomacy. A tough approach from the UK and our allies is vital to strengthen Ukraine's hand in negotiations,"" Truss said. ""Britain has helped lead the way with sanctions to cripple the Putin war machine. We will do more to ramp up the pressure on Russia and we will keep pushing others to do more."" Truss is due to meet Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba in Poland's capital Warsaw later today and her Polish counterpart Zbigniew Rau on Tuesday. Britain, a former European Union member, has coordinated with international allies to impose sanctions on key Russian industries and Moscow's wealthy elites with the aim of crippling its economy in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Russia's chief investigator orders probe into Ukraine's Bucha claims Russia's chief investigator ordered an official probe into Ukraine's accusations of Russian forces killing hundreds of civilians in the town of Bucha, near Kyiv. In a statement Monday, Russia's Investigative Committee said it was looking into Ukraine's claims, as well as images shared by Ukrainian officials that it said aimed to ""discredit the Russian military personnel."" Russia has rejected the claim that its forces killed civilians in Bucha, despite photos and video appearing to show dead bodies on city streets as its troops pulled out of Bucha and other cities near Kyiv.

Zelenskyy decries war atrocities in new address, saying, 'Evil will be punished' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivered his harshest rebuke yet Sunday as Russian forces retreated from the war-torn city of Bucha, Ukraine, leaving in their wake a mass of what appeared to be civilian fatalities. ""Today this appeal will be without congratulations. I do not want any extra words. Presidents do not usually record appeals like this. But today I have to say just that. To say after what opened in Bucha and our other cities, from which the occupiers were chased out. Hundreds of people were killed. Tortured, shot — civilians. Bodies on the streets. Mined territory,"" Zelenskyy said. ""The bodies of the dead were mined."" Zelenskyy switched from speaking Ukrainian and made a direct appeal in Russian, saying: ""I want every mother of every Russian soldier to see the bodies of the killed people in Bucha, in Irpin, in Hostomel. What did they do? Why were they killed? What did the man who was riding his bicycle down the street do? Why were ordinary civilians tortured to death in an ordinary peaceful city? Why were women strangled after their earrings were torn out of their ears? How could women be raped and killed in front of children? Their bodies were mocked even after death. Why did they crush the bodies of people with tanks? What did the Ukrainian city of Bucha do to your Russia? How did all this become possible?"" He added: ""Russian mothers! Even if you raised marauders, how did they also become executioners? You couldn't help but know what's inside your children. You could not help but notice that they are deprived of everything human. No soul. No heart. They killed deliberately and with pleasure."" Speaking again in Ukrainian, Zelenskyy said that ""evil will be punished"" and that he had created a ""special mechanism of justice"" in Ukraine to investigate and prosecute every crime of Russian occupiers in the country. ""The essence of this mechanism is the joint work of national and international experts: investigators, prosecutors and judges. This mechanism will help Ukraine and the world to bring to justice those who unleashed or in any way participated in this terrible war against the Ukrainian people and in crimes against our people,"" he said.

Bucha residents say Russian troops killed civilians BUCHA, Ukraine — Residents of the Ukrainian town of Bucha, near the capital of Kyiv, have given harrowing accounts of how Russian troops shot and killed civilians without any apparent reason. Bodies of civilians lay strewn across the northern town, which was controlled by Russian soldiers for about a month. At a logistics compound that residents say was used as a base by Russian forces, the bodies of eight men could be seen dumped on the ground, some with their hands tied behind their backs.

NATO chief: This is 'not a real withdrawal' NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Sunday said Russia is shifting its strategy in Ukraine, explaining that Putin's retreat from Kyiv is not a sign that he is withdrawing from the country. “What we see is not a real withdrawal,"" Stoltenberg said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. ""What we see is that Russia is repositioning its troops, and they are taking some of them back to rearm them, to reinforce them, to resupply them. But we should not in a way be too optimistic because the attacks will continue."" His remarks came after Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned of a Russian buildup of forces in the east of his war-torn country, in a video posted to Telegram on Saturday. In an intelligence briefing, British defense officials said Moscow's naval forces have continued to blockade areas on Ukraine's southern coast, preventing resupply by sea. There is concern about ""potential increased attacks, especially in the south and in the east. So this is not a real withdrawal but more a shift in the strategy, focusing more on the south and the east,"" Stoltenberg added. Share this -

""And at the same time, they may be regrouping. They may be recalibrating."" In a video posted to Telegram on Saturday night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia was building up forces in the east of the country and called on Western countries to provide more anti-missile systems. Russia wants to ""capture both the Donbas and the south of Ukraine,"" he said. The U.S. has a strong interest in ending the violence, Blinken said, and ""the way to do that is to give Ukraine the strongest possible hand to put as much pressure as we possibly can on Russia, while we're strengthening our own defenses."" ""That's exactly what we've been doing,"" he added. ""Time is certainly not on Vladimir Putin's side, because, as I said, a sovereign, independent Ukraine has demonstrated it's going to be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin is on the scene.""

Russian naval forces block Ukraine's resupply by Black Sea, U.K. military intelligence says Russian naval forces continue to blockade the Ukrainian coast on the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, preventing resupply by sea, British military intelligence said Sunday. In its latest assessment of the situation, the U.K.'s defense ministry tweeted that Russia still retains the capability to attempt an amphibious landing, but such an operation is likely to be increasingly high risk given the time Ukrainian forces have had to prepare. ""Reported mines within the Black Sea pose a serious risk to maritime activity,"" it added. The report said the origin of the mines was unclear and disputed, but their presence was almost certainly the result of Russian naval activity in the area, demonstrating how its invasion of Ukraine is affecting neutral and civilian interests.

These offenses were committed between Feb. 27 and March 14, it said. Russian soldiers were also implicated in looting civilian property, including food, clothing and firewood, it said. “The cases we documented amount to unspeakable, deliberate cruelty and violence against Ukrainian civilians,” said Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Rape, murder, and other violent acts against people in the Russian forces’ custody should be investigated as war crimes.” Share this -

LAS VEGAS — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has appeared in a video at the Grammy Awards asking for support in telling the story of Ukraine’s invasion by Russia.

During the pre-recorded message that aired on the show Sunday night, he spoke in English, likening the attack to a deadly silence threatening to extinguish the dreams and lives of the Ukrainian people, including children.

In his words: “Our musicians wear body armor instead of tuxedos. They sing to the wounded in hospitals, even to those who can’t hear them. But the music will break through anyway.”

The Recording Academy, with its partner Global Citizen, prior to the ceremony highlighted a social media campaign called “Stand Up For Ukraine” to raise money and humanitarian support.

Zelenskyy told the audience: “Fill the silence with your music. Fill it today to tell our story. Tell the truth about the war on your social networks, on TV, support us in any way you can any, but not silence. And then peace will come to all our cities.”

Following Zelenskyy’s message, John Legend performed his song “Free” with Ukrainian musicians Siuzanna Iglidan and Mika Newton and poet Lyuba Yakimchuk as images from the war were shown on screens behind them.

OTHER DEVELOPMENTS:

KYIV, Ukraine — The Ukrainian military says that its forces have retaken some towns in the Chernihiv region and that humanitarian aid is being delivered.

The news agency RBK Ukraina says the road between Chernihiv and the capital of Kyiv is to reopen to some traffic later Monday.

Chernihiv is a city 80 miles north of Kyiv and it had been cut off from shipments of food and other supplies for weeks. The mayor said Sunday that relentless Russian shelling had destroyed 70% of the city.

Russian forces also withdrew from the Sumy region, in Ukraine’s northeast, local administrator Dmitry Zhivitsky said in a video message carried by Ukrainian news agencies Sunday. The troops had occupied the area for nearly a month.

In other areas recently retaken from Russian troops, Ukrainian officials say they have recovered hundreds of slain civilians in the past few days. Ukraine’s prosecutor-general says the bodies of 410 civilians have been recovered from Kyiv-area towns.

KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine’s prosecutor-general says the bodies of 410 civilians have been removed from Kyiv-area towns that were recently retaken from Russian troops.

Iryna Venediktova says on Facebook that the bodies were recovered Friday, Saturday and Sunday. She says 140 of them have undergone examination by prosecutors and other specialists.

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk says the mayor of the village of Motyzhyn in the Kyiv region was murdered while being held by Russian forces. Vereshchuk adds that there are 11 mayors and community heads in Russian captivity across Ukraine.

In a video address Sunday, Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denounced the allegedly targeted killings of civilians in towns that the Russians occupied, calling the killers “freaks who do not know how to do otherwise.” He warns that more atrocities may be revealed if Russian forces are driven out of other occupied areas.

International leaders have condemned the reported attacks in the Kyiv-area towns after harrowing accounts from civilians and graphic images of bodies with hands tied behind their backs.

Russia’s Defense Ministry has rejected the claims of atrocities against civilians in Bucha and other suburbs of Kyiv.

BALAKLIYA, Ukraine — The governor of the Kharkiv region says Russian troops fired on a convoy of buses that was trying to evacuate patients from a hospital that had been heavily damaged in shelling a day earlier.

The governor, Oleh Synyehubov, said Sunday that about 70 patients needed to be taken away from the damaged hospital in the town of Balakliya but that the buses were not able to enter the town.

He said there was preliminary information that one of the bus drivers was killed.

Balakliya is about 75 kilometers (45 miles) southeast of the city of Kharkiv, which has been heavily hit by Russian attacks.

BERLIN — Germany’s defense minister says European officials should talk about halting gas supplies from Russia in light of the alleged attacks on civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha.

Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said Sunday night on German public broadcaster ARD that “there must be a reaction. Such crimes must not go unanswered.”

So far, Germany and several other European governments have shied away from an immediate boycott of Russian natural gas over fears of the impact it would have on their economies.

Europe gets 40% of its gas and 25% of its oil from Russia, and since the war, has scrambled to set out proposals to reduce its dependency. Russia is just as reliant on Europe, with oil and gas its dominant sector and paying for government operations.

Estimates of the impact of a gas boycott or embargo on Europe vary but most involve a substantial loss of economic output.

JERUSALEM __ Israel’s foreign minister is condemning the reported atrocities in Ukraine, saying deliberate harm to civilians is a war crime.

Foreign Minister Yair Lapid wrote on Twitter that one “cannot remain indifferent” after seeing images from the town of Bucha near Ukraine capital.

Israel has walked a tightrope since Russia invaded Ukraine, simultaneously denouncing the invasion while avoiding taking too strident a stance out of concern of angering Moscow, with whom it has security coordination in neighboring Syria. Israel has good relations with both countries and has mediated between them since the invasion on Feb. 24.

Lapid says that intentionally harming a civilian population is a war crime and strongly condemned it.

MOTYZHYN, Ukraine — A resident says the mayor of the Ukrainian town of Motyzhyn was killed in an execution-style slaying along with her husband and son.

Another resident of the town 50 kilometers (31 miles) west of Kyiv told the The Associated Press on Sunday that Russian troops targeted local officials in a bid to win them over and killed them if they did not collaborate. That man, Oleg, declined to give his full name for security reasons.

The mayor, Olga Sukhenko, and her family were shot and thrown into a pit in a forest behind a plot of land with three houses where Russian forces had slept. A fourth body was not yet identified.

The mayor and her family had been reported by others as kidnapped by Russians on March 23 and taken in an unknown direction.

LONDON — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson says Russia’s attack on Ukranian civilians in towns on the outskirts of Kyiv “are yet more evidence that Russian President Vladimir Putin and his army are committing war crimes in Ukraine.”

Johnson called the attacks in the towns of Irpin and Bucha “despicable” and says he “will do everything in my power to starve Putin’s war machine.” Johnson added that the U.K. will step up its sanctions and military support for Ukraine, but did not provide details.

Other European leaders also condemned the reported attacks on Ukranian civilians in response to images of bodies in the streets and some of the dead with their hands tied behind their backs.

Leaders in France, Germany, Italy, Greece, Czech Republic and Poland expressed outrage at the images. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala called the images ”horrifying” and says Russia has been committing war crimes.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz says international organizations should be given access to the areas to independently document the atrocities.

French Foreign Affairs Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian says his country will work with Ukrainian authorities and the International Criminal Court “to ensure these acts don’t go unpunished.”

BRUSSELS — NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg says the graphic images coming out of Bucha, Ukraine, after Russian troops withdrew show “a brutality against civilians we haven’t seen in Europe for decades.”

He tells CNN’s “State of the Union” that “it’s absolutely unacceptable that civilians are targeted and killed” and that it’s Russian President Vladimir Putin’s responsibility to stop the war.

Stoltenberg says it’s “extremely important” that the International Criminal Court has opened an investigation into potential war crimes in Ukraine and that those responsible are held to account.

His comments echoed those by other European leaders, who condemned alleged war crimes and civilian killings by Russian forces in Ukrainian towns including Bucha near Kyiv, the capital.

BUCHA, Ukraine — Residents of the Ukrainian town of Bucha near the capital of Kyiv have given harrowing accounts of how Russian troops shot and killed civilians without any apparent reason.

Bodies of civilians lay strewn across the northern town, which was controlled by Russian soldiers for about a month.

At a logistics compound that residents say was used as a base by Russian forces, the bodies of 8 men could be seen dumped on the ground, some with their hands tied behind their backs.

Residents say Russian troops would go from building to building, take people out of the basements where they were hiding from the fighting, check their phones for evidence of anti-Russian activity and take them away or shoot them.

Russia’s Defense Ministry has rejected the claims of atrocities against civilians in Bucha and other suburbs of Kyiv as a “provocation.”

The ministry says that “not a single civilian has faced any violent action by the Russian military“ in Bucha.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, told a U.S. television interview Sunday that Russian attacks in Ukraine amount to genocide.

ROME — The head of Italy’s Democratic Party called for a full oil and gas embargo in reaction to images emerging of atrocities against civilians by Russian soldiers retreating from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv.

“How many #Buca before we move to a full oil and gas Russia embargo,” Enrico Letta wrote on Twitter Sunday. “Time is over.”

Italy gets 40% of its natural gas from Russia and officials have said it would take three years to make the transition to other sources.

Premier Mario Draghi acknowledged last week that energy payments were fueling Russia’s invasion, and the foreign minister has been traveling to oil and gas producing countries to line up alternatives to Russia.

WASHINGTON — White House chief of staff Ron Klain says the U.S. remains fully committed to providing a full range of economic and military support to Ukraine in its war against Russia, which he describes as “far from over.”

Klain credits Ukrainians for fighting off Russian troops in the northern part of Ukraine and says the U.S. and its allies are sending weapons into the country “almost every single day.”

But he also tells ABC’s “This Week” that there are signs that Russian President Vladimir Putin is redeploying Russian troops to the eastern part of Ukraine.

Klain says while it will be up to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to decide if the political endgame is to allow Russia to occupy the eastern part of Ukraine, from the U.S. standpoint, the “military future of this attack has to be push back.”

He says regarding a potential Russian occupation of eastern Ukraine: “I will tell you, as President Zelenskyy has said, that’s not acceptable to him, and we are going to support him with military aid, with economic aid, with humanitarian aid.”

KYIV, Ukraine — The Ukrainian military says Russian troops have completed their pullback from the country’s north.

The military’s General Staff said in Sunday’s statement that Russian units have withdrawn from areas in the country’s north to neighboring Belarus, which served as a staging ground for the Russian invasion.

The Ukrainian military said its airborne forces have taken full control of the town of Pripyat just outside the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear power plant and the section of the border with Belarus. It posted a picture of the Ukrainian soldier putting up the country’s flag with a shelter containing the Chernobyl reactor that exploded in 1986 seen in the background.

VILNIUS, Lithuania — Lithuania says it has cut itself off entirely of gas imports from Russia and that it’s the first of the European Union’s 27 nations using Russian gas to break its energy dependence upon Moscow.

“Seeking full energy independence from Russian gas, in response to Russia’s energy blackmail in Europe and the war in Ukraine, Lithuania has completely abandoned Russian gas,” Lithuania’s energy ministry said in a statement late Saturday, adding that the measure took effect in the beginning of April.

Lithuania reduced imports of Russian gas to zero on Saturday, a move seen a milestone in achieving energy independence in the former Soviet republic of 2.8 million, the ministry said.

“We are the first EU country among Gazprom’s supply countries to gain independence from Russian gas supplies, and this is the result of a multi-year coherent energy policy and timely infrastructure decisions,” Minister of Energy Dainius Kreivys said.

Lithuania’a president posted an upbeat tweet on his account and urged other European nations to do the same.

KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine’s top diplomat has called for tougher sanctions on Russia over growing evidence of what he called a massacre of civilians in the suburbs of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.

Ukrainian officials said earlier Sunday that scores of killed civilians have been found on the streets of Kyiv’ suburbs of Bucha, Irpin and Hostomel after the withdrawal of Russian troops. They said that some of the victims were shot in the head and had their hands bound.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted Sunday that the killings were “deliberate,” adding that “Russians aim to eliminate as many Ukrainians as they can.”

He urged the West to impose an oil, gas and coal embargo, and close all ports to Russian vessels and goods. He also called for all Russian banks to be disconnected from the SWIFT international payment system.

In Germany President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said in Berlin that “the war crimes committed by Russia are visible before the eyes of the world.”

German news agency dpa reported that Steinmeier said “the images from Bucha shake me, they shake us deeply.”

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock pledged to tighten sanctions against Russia but did not give details.

BERLIN — Poland’s most powerful politician says he is open to the permanent stationing of U.S. nuclear weapons in Eastern Europe.

Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of Poland’s ruling conservative party, Law and Justice, said Sunday in an interview with German weekly Welt am Sonntag that “in principle, it makes sense to extend nuclear participation to the eastern flank.”

Kaczynski added that “if the Americans asked us to store U.S. nuclear weapons in Poland, we would be open to it. It would significantly strengthen deterrence against Moscow.”

Kaczynski acknowledged that “at the moment, this question does not arise, but that may change soon.”

The Polish leader also called for a much stronger presence of U.S. soldiers in Europe in the future, especially on NATO’s eastern flank.

He said that “Poland would welcome an increase in the American presence in Europe in the future from the current 100,000 soldiers to 150,000 soldiers because of Russia’s increasing aggressiveness.”

MOSCOW — The Kremlin says that by imposing sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin the West has demonstrated it has abandoned its sense of reason.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in televised remarks Sunday that the sanctions against Putin were going “beyond the edge of reason,” adding that they showed that the West is “capable of any stupidities.”

Peskov added that Putin’s meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is “hypothetically possible” once negotiators from the two countries prepared a draft agreement to be discussed.

KYIV, Ukraine — A Ukrainian presidential adviser says authorities have found evidence of serious war crimes by Russian troops on the outskirts of Kyiv.

Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said Sunday scores of killed civilians have been found on the streets of Kyiv’ suburbs of Irpin, Bucha and Hostomel after the withdrawal of Russian troops. He compared the scene to “a horror movie.”

Arestovych said some victims were shot in the head and had their hands bound, and some of the bodies had signs of torture. He accused Russian troops of raping women and trying to burn their bodies.

Arestovych said Ukrainian authorities will investigate the alleged war crimes and track down the perpetrators.

The reports drew international condemnation. In Britain, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said there is increasing evidence of “indiscriminate attacks against innocent civilians” and said they must be investigated as war crimes.

“We will not allow Russia to cover up their involvement in these atrocities through cynical disinformation and will ensure that the reality of Russia’s actions are brought to light,” she said.

MOSCOW — Russia’s top negotiator in talks with Ukraine says it’s too early to talk about a meeting between the two countries’ president.

Vladimir Medinsky, who led the Russian delegation in Tuesday’s talks in Istanbul, Turkey, said “there is still a lot of work to do” to finalize a draft agreement before Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could meet.

Speaking Sunday in remarks carried by the Interfax news agency, Medinsky reaffirmed that the parties reached a tentative agreement on the need for Ukraine to adopt a neutral status and refrain from holding foreign military bases in exchange for international security guarantees.

Asked about Ukrainian negotiator Davyd Arakhamia’s claim that Moscow’s negotiators had informally agreed to most proposals by Ukraine during the talks in Istanbul this week and the two presidents could discuss the draft deal, Medinsky said he doesn’t share Arakhamia’s optimism. He said the talks will continue online Monday.

Medinsky emphasized that Russia’s stand on Crimea and rebel regions in Ukraine’s east remained unchanged. The Kremlin demands that Ukraine acknowledge Russia’s sovereignty over Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014, and recognize the independence of Russia-backed separatist regions in Donbas, Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland.

BERLIN — The mayor of the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, has expressed shock at what he called “cruel war crimes” committed by Russian soldiers in the town of Bucha northwest of the capital.

Referring to reports of executed civilians, Klitschko told German daily Bild on Sunday that “what happened in Bucha and other suburbs of Kyiv can only be described as genocide.”

An AP crew on Sunday saw the bodies of at least nine people who appear to have been executed. At least two of them had their hands tied behind their backs. They were all in civilian clothes and at least three were naked from the waist up. One appeared shot in the chest from close range.

Klitschko said Russian President Vladimir Putin was responsible for the “cruel war crimes,” adding that civilians had been “shot with tied hands.”

He called on the the whole world and especially Germany to immediately end gas imports from Russia.

He said that “especially for Germany, there can only be one consequence: Not a penny should go to Russia anymore, that’s bloody money used to slaughter people. The gas and oil embargo must come immediately.”",https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-middle-east-black-sea-religion-a97f60a50df0d8dc1e0f126a33144560

He described a column of dark smoke rising from the targets and flames from the buildings.

""What we can see is a dense screen of dark smoke, and one explosion after the other,"" Orlandi said.

Attacks in Kharkiv

The governor of the Kharkiv region says Russian troops fired on a convoy of buses that was trying to transport patients from a hospital that had been heavily damaged in shelling a day earlier.

Gov. Oleh Synyehubov said Sunday that about 70 patients needed to be taken away from the damaged hospital in the town of Balakliya — about 75 kilometres southeast of the city of Kharkiv — but that the buses were not able to enter the town. He said there was preliminary information that one of the bus drivers was killed.

Earlier on Sunday, Synyehubov said Russian artillery and tanks carried out more than 20 strikes on Kharkiv and its outskirts over the past 24 hours.

Synyehubov had said said four people were wounded in a Russian missile strike on Lozova, in the south of the Kharkiv region.

Russians withdrawing from north

The Ukrainian military says Russian troops have completed their pullback from the country's north.

The military's General Staff said in Sunday's statement that Russian units have withdrawn from areas in the country's north to neighbouring Belarus, which served as a staging ground for the Russian invasion.

Officials working on Mariupol evacuations

Work on evacuating Mariupol was to continue on Sunday with buses attempting to come close to the besieged city, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said.

Vereshchuk said Ukrainian officials were in talks with Russia to allow several Red Cross buses to enter the city. The Red Cross abandoned earlier attempts due to security concerns. Russia blamed the Red Cross for the delays.

Mariupol is Russia's main target in Ukraine's southeastern region of Donbas — an area that's been partly controlled by Moscow-backed separatists since 2014 — and tens of thousands of civilians there have been trapped for weeks with scant access to food and water.

The fall of the southern port city would help Russia establish a land bridge from the Donbas to Crimea, a southern region annexed by Russia in 2014.

Vereshchuk also said on Sunday that 2,694 people were rescued from conflict zones in Mariupol and the region of Luhansk, which is also located in the Donbas region.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ukraine-russia-war-1.6406800

11:10 p.m. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala says the country should cut its dependence on Russian energy resources within five years, calling the current situation one of the Czech Republic's ""greatest security risks."" The EU member meets its gas needs almost entirely through shipments directly or indirectly from Russia, and gets roughly half its crude imports from the same source. Fiala adds the country's energy sector has to change ""completely.""

9:59 p.m. European Union countries sharing borders with Russia and Belarus bar some cargo vehicles registered in the two countries from entering due to sanctions, the Russian customs service says, according to Reuters. Vehicles used as international transport that have Russian and Belarusian number plates will not be able to move goods on EU territory, the Russian customs service says. This comes after the EU on Friday formally adopted new sanctions against Russia, including bans on the import of coal, wood, chemicals and other products, while also preventing many Russian vessels and trucks from accessing the bloc.

3:31 p.m. S&P lowers Russia's foreign currency ratings to ""selective default"" on increased risks that Moscow will not be able and willing to honor its commitments to foreign debtholders.

11:50 a.m. Russia's justice ministry says it has revoked the registration of 15 foreign organizations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. The Russian units of the 15 organizations, which include the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, ""were excluded due to the discovery of violations of the current legislation of the Russian Federation,"" the ministry said in a statement on Friday.

The decision, which did not give details of any violations, was announced days after New York-based HRW said it had found ""several cases of Russian military forces committing laws-of-war violations"" in Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied war crimes allegations by Ukraine and Western countries during its six-week-long invasion of Ukraine and denies targeting civilians.

4:10 a.m. Germany is working to end imports of Russian oil and believes it may do so this year, Chancellor Olaf Scholz says in London during a news conference with U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

The European Union is studying ways to phase out its imports of Russian oil, according to EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. But ending German dependence on Russian natural gas poses a higher hurdle. No timeline has been set for such a transition.

The U.K. has announced plans to phase out imports of Russian coal and crude oil by the end of 2022, followed by gas imports at an early date.

3:17 a.m. The U.S. believes Russia used a short-range ballistic missile to strike a railway station in east Ukraine on Friday, a senior U.S. defense official says. Ukraine said at least 50 people were killed and many more wounded in the strike.

Friday, April 8

10:30 p.m. The ruble rallied after Russia's central bank cut its main interest rate in a surprise move. The cut, which follows new sanctions on Russia including a U.S. ban on crude oil imports, partly reverses an emergency rate hike in late February after the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""Today's decision reflects a change in the balance of risks of accelerated consumer price growth, decline in economic activity and financial stability risks,"" the Central Bank of Russia says in a statement reported by Interfax.

8:50 p.m. Russian citizens are spending on average 40% of their disposable income on food, about double the amount from before Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, the director of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization's Russia liaison office tells Reuters. Russian government data shows annual food inflation hit 18.75% on April 1 as the economy reels from Western sanctions. The average European Union household spends about 12% of its income on food, the director says.

Meanwhile, global food prices have hit record levels in the wake of the Ukraine war, the latest FAO data shows.

6:00 p.m. More than 30 people were killed and over 100 were wounded in a Russian rocket strike on a railway station in eastern Ukraine on Friday as civilians tried to evacuate to safer parts of the country, the state railway company says. It said two Russian rockets struck a station in the city of Kramatorsk, which is used to evacuate civilians from areas under bombardment by Russian forces.

4:50 p.m. Japan's Foreign Ministry says it will expel a number of Russian diplomats stationed in the country in Tokyo's latest response to the civilian killings reported during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Eight Russians, including diplomats, will be expelled, it announced Friday. Japan has been cautious about expelling Russian diplomats up to now, but changed course as the U.S. and European countries have moved to punish Russia diplomatically. Tokyo's decision is likely to prompt Moscow to make tit-for-tat expulsions of Japanese diplomats from Russia.

3:30 p.m. India's central bank cuts its economic growth forecast for the fiscal year that started April 1 to 7.2%, from the 7.8% projected in February, citing the Russia-Ukraine war.

""Although India's direct trade exposure to countries at the epicenter of the conflict is limited, the war could potentially impede the economic recovery through elevated commodity prices and global spillover channels,"" Reserve Bank of India Gov. Shaktikanta Das says.

There are several other factors at work, he adds. ""Financial market volatility induced by monetary policy normalization in advanced economies, renewed COVID-19 infections in some major countries with augmented supply-side disruptions and protracted shortages of critical inputs, such as semiconductors and chips, pose downside risks to the outlook.""

3:18 p.m. Ukraine says it aims to establish up to 10 humanitarian corridors to evacuate trapped civilians on Friday, but civilians trying to flee the besieged southern city of Mariupol will have to use private vehicles. The 10 planned safe corridors announced by Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk were all in southern and eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian officials say Moscow plans to seize as much territory as it can in the eastern part of Ukraine known as Donbas bordering Russia.

11:00 a.m. The chairman of Russian aluminum giant Rusal calls for an impartial investigation into the killing of civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, which he described as a crime, and urged an end to the ""fratricidal"" conflict. While the statement from Chairman Bernard Zonneveld, a Dutch national, did not touch on who was to blame for the deaths of civilians in the town, it is unusual for a large Russian company to comment publicly on the conflict. ""We support an objective and impartial investigation of this crime and call for severe punishment for the perpetrators,"" he said.

10:18 a.m. Japan will phase out Russian coal imports as part of its sanctions against Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine, Japan's industry minister says, joining other Group of Seven industrialized nations. Koichi Hagiuda told a regular news conference that Japan will gradually reduce the amount imported from Russia, and eventually break Japan's dependence on its coal, saying, ""We seek to stop importing in the end."" The move comes a day after G-7 foreign ministers vowed to ""expedite"" plans to end their energy dependence on Russia by phasing out and banning Russian coal imports to punish Moscow.

9:05 a.m. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says work has begun to dig through the rubble in Borodianka, a city northwest of Kyiv that was occupied by Russian military forces. He also said ""it is much scarier"" there, with even more victims of Russian troops. In his daily nighttime video address to the nation Thursday, Zelenskyy said the Russians were preparing to shock the world in the same way by showing corpses in Mariupol and falsely claiming they were killed by the Ukrainian defenders.

4:30 a.m. Pink Floyd is releasing its first new music in almost three decades to raise money for the people of Ukraine, the band announces. ""Hey Hey Rise Up"" features Pink Floyd members David Gilmour and Nick Mason, with vocals from Ukrainian singer Andriy Khlyvnyuk of the band BoomBox.

The track features Khlyvnyuk singing a patriotic Ukrainian song from a clip he recorded in front of Kyiv's St. Sophia Cathedral and posted on social media.

2:51 a.m. Russia has sustained ""significant"" troop losses in Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov tells British television channel Sky News.

""We have significant losses of troops, and ... it's a huge tragedy for us,"" he says when responding to interviewer Mark Austin's question: ""You've lost thousands of troops. How many troops have you lost?""

Peskov expresses hope that the operation will achieve its goals, or end via negotiations, in the coming days but also calls verified imagery of dead civilians in Bucha a ""bold fake.""

Russia's Defense Ministry reported March 25 that 1,351 service members had been killed, and 3,825 wounded, since the start of the operation, state news agency Tass says in a brief story about the interview.

2:00 a.m. The United Nations suspends Russia from the Human Rights Council in a vote. Ninety-three member states voted for the resolution. Twenty-four voted against, including Russia and China.

Thursday, April 7

11:55 p.m. The U.S. Senate overwhelmingly backs legislation to remove ""most favored nation"" trade status for Russia and its close ally Belarus over the invasion of Ukraine, allowing for higher tariffs on imports from the two countries. As voting continues, the tally in the 100-member Senate was 65-0 in favor of removing Permanent Normal Trade Relations status.

Senate approval will send the measure to the House of Representatives, where passage is expected later on Thursday, sending the legislation to the White House for President Joe Biden to sign into law.

6:30 p.m. Russia's communications watchdog said on Thursday it was taking punitive measures against Google, including a ban on advertising the platform and its information resources, for violating Russian law. Roskomnadzor accused Google's YouTube video-sharing platform, which has shut out Russian state-funded media globally, of becoming ""one of the key platforms spreading fakes (fake images) about the course of (Russia's) special military operation on the territory of Ukraine, discrediting the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.""

3:40 p.m. Shell will write down up to $5 billion following its decision to exit Russia, higher than previously disclosed, while soaring oil and gas prices boosted trading activities in the first quarter, the company says. The post-tax impairments of between $4 billion and $5 billion in the first quarter will not impact the company's earnings, Shell said in an update ahead of its earnings announcement on May 5. It had previously said the Russia write-downs would reach around $3.4 billion.

1:30 p.m. The U.N. General Assembly will vote on Thursday on a U.S. push to suspend Russia from its Human Rights Council over reports of ""gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights"" by Russian troops in Ukraine. A two-thirds majority of voting members -- abstentions do not count -- can suspend a country from the 47-member council. Western diplomats are confident they have enough support among the 193-member General Assembly to adopt a resolution to suspend Moscow.

10:30 a.m. International Energy Agency states have agreed to tap 60 million barrels of oil from storage, the director of the group says, on top of a 180-million-barrel release announced by Washington last week aimed at cooling prices after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The move by the U.S.-allied IEA countries, which represent 31 mostly industrialized countries but not Russia, would be their second coordinated release in a month and would be the fifth in the agency's history to confront oil market outages.

10:18 a.m. U.S. sanctions against two of Russia's largest banks are ""a direct blow to the Russian population [and] ordinary citizens,"" the Tass news agency cites Russia's U.S. ambassador as saying on Wednesday.

5:00 a.m. The U.S. believes Russian forces have completely withdrawn from the area around Kyiv, a senior American official says.

The troops were pulling back to Belarus and Russia to regroup, the official says. They may join the fighting in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donbas, which Russia has designated the new focus of its ""special military operation"" -- what Moscow calls its invasion.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also says a small number of Ukrainians are receiving training in the U.S. to use tank-killing Switchblade drones. These Ukrainians are supposed to return to their country soon, the official says.

4:00 a.m. Chinese President Xi Jinping's personal alliance with Russian President Vladimir Putin is hampering China's diplomacy. That is becoming clearer as the war in Ukraine rages on.

Both men have laid the groundwork to stay in power until the middle of the 2030s. Both have territorial ambitions: reestablishing the former Soviet Union's sphere of influence for Putin, Taiwan for Xi. But the association comes with significant risk. Read more in this week's China Up Close.

2:00 a.m. One world leader willing to accept Russia's demand to pay for natural gas in rubles is Hungary's Victor Orban.

The Hungarian prime minister, whose right-wing ruling party won by a landslide in a parliamentary election Sunday, tells a news conference he has called on Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine immediately and says he is reconsidering his country's close ties with Moscow. Yet Orban says ""if the Russians request it, we will pay in rubles,"" the Financial Times reports.

Germany and other countries have rejected Putin's demand for payment in rubles, which Russia has yet to enforce.

2:10 a.m. New U.S. sanctions on Russia add the country's top bank, Sberbank, to the list of targets, as well as family members of Russia President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. These and other international responses to Russia's invasion of Ukraine are not lost on China, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman says.

""The strong and coordinated response from the international community, including nations in the Indo-Pacific, to Russia's flagrant violations on international law and principles like sovereignty and territorial integrity sends a strong signal that such actions will not go ignored,"" Sherman tells the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

The range of sanctions and ""unprecedented"" coordination between the U.S. and its partners give Chinese President Xi Jinping a ""good understanding of what might come his way should he in fact support Putin in any material fashion,"" Sherman says.

On support for U.S. partners, Republican Congressman Michael McCaul of Texas says: ""Putin's invasion of Russia shows us how critical it is to give our allies the weapons they need before an invasion and not after."" McCaul is preparing to introduce a bill that would create ""a security assistance program for Taiwan.""

Wednesday, April 6

8:00 p.m. Mere months ago Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was on the ropes. The lira had crashed and his unorthodox monetary policy was being ridiculed in financial markets.

But the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and its subsequent struggles on the battlefield, have led to a dramatic diplomatic turnaround for Turkey, which finds itself at the center of efforts to establish a cease-fire.

It stands in contrast to China and India, who have been criticized by the global community for sitting on the fence. Read more.

6:00 p.m. Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar says in parliament that New Delhi is ""deeply disturbed"" by the reports of civilians killed in Bucha. ""We strongly condemned the killings which have taken place there. This is an extremely serious matter, and we support the call for an independent investigation,"" he adds.

India, which has extensive defense dealings with Russia, has been reluctant to speak out against the invasion.

""If India has chosen a side, it is the side of peace and it is for an immediate end to violence,"" Jaishankar says.

5:37 p.m. Pope Francis condemns the ""massacre of Bucha,"" while holding up a Ukrainian flag sent to him from the town where hundreds of civilians were executed and mass graves have been found.

""Recent news from the war in Ukraine, instead of bringing relief and hope, brought new atrocities, such as the massacre of Bucha,"" he said during his weekly address. ""Cruelty that is increasingly horrendous, even against civilians, defenseless women and children. They are victims whose innocent blood cries out up to heaven and implores: 'Stop this war! Let the weapons fall silent! Stop sowing death and destruction.'""

The Kremlin said on Tuesday allegations that Russian forces committed war crimes by executing civilians in Bucha were a ""monstrous forgery"" aimed at denigrating its army.

11:18 a.m. U.S. chipmaker Intel says it has suspended operations in Russia, joining a slew of companies exiting the country following its invasion of Ukraine. The company, which last month suspended shipments to customers in Russia and Belarus, said it has implemented business continuity measures to minimize disruption to its global operations.

IBM, too, has suspended shipments, as Ukraine urged U.S. cloud-computing and software companies to cut off business with Russia. Servers from IBM, Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard top the market in Russia, where companies and government agencies have relied on technology developed by the West as the basis for their IT systems.

4:20 a.m. The U.S. and its Group of Seven and European Union allies on Wednesday will impose new sanctions against Russian banks and government officials and ban investment in Russia, a source familiar with the announcement tells Reuters.

The measures will ""degrade key instruments of Russian state power, impose acute and immediate economic harm on Russia and hold accountable the Russian kleptocracy that funds and supports (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's war,"" the source says.

3:00 a.m. NATO foreign ministers will meet with their counterparts from the Asia-Pacific this week, seeking to gain their cooperation in deepening the economic and diplomatic isolation of Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.

Top diplomats from eight countries and the European Union will take part, including Ukraine as well as Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. In light of reports of alleged war crimes by Russia in Ukraine, the ministers are expected to discuss their responses, including additional assistance to Kyiv.

""Targeting and murdering civilians is a war crime,"" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg tells reporters on Tuesday. Read more.

2:45 a.m. Asked whether the U.S. was providing military training to Ukrainians outside of Ukraine, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin says: ""To use some of the gear, certainly they have to have training, and we're doing that.""

Austin's comments come at a House Armed Services Committee hearing with Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair Gen. Mark Milley.

2:30 a.m. The United Nations has failed to function in the face of the worst war crimes since World War II, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has told the U.N. Security Council.

Tuesday, April 5

11:13 p.m. The Czech Republic has sent T-72 tanks and BVP-1 infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine, a Czech defense source tells Reuters.

10:00 p.m. The 30 NATO allies would welcome Finland and Sweden into the alliance if they decided to join, but any such move is up to the two nations, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg says.

NATO likely would find ways ""to address the concerns they may have about this interim period between having applied and until the last ratification [by allies] has taken place,"" he says, referring to possible Russian retaliation before the pair were fully under NATO protection.

5:52 p.m. Italy has expelled 30 Russian diplomats because of security concerns, according to Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio. Denmark says it will expel 15 Russian diplomats, in line with steps taken by other European Union countries, after reports of mass graves of civilians being found in Bucha.

5:30 p.m. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Ukraine has no option but to negotiate with Russia to end the fighting but that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin may not personally hold talks. ""All of us, including myself, will perceive even the possibility of negotiations as a challenge,"" Zelenskyy says in an interview with Ukrainian journalists broadcast on national television.

2:50 p.m. Ukrainian forces have retaken key northern terrain, forcing Russian forces to retreat from areas around the city of Chernihiv and north of the capital, Kyiv, British military intelligence says. Low-level fighting is likely to continue in some of the recaptured areas but reduce this week as the remainder of the Russian forces withdraw, the defense ministry said in a regular bulletin on Twitter. Many of the withdrawing Russian units are likely to require significant reequipping and refurbishment before they redeploy for operations in the country's east, the ministry added.

12:10 p.m. The U.S. has stopped the Russian government from paying holders of its sovereign debt totaling more than $600 million from reserves held at American banks. Under sanctions put in place after Russia invaded Ukraine, foreign currency reserves held by the Russian central bank at U.S. financial institutions were frozen. But the Treasury Department had been allowing Moscow to use those funds to make coupon payments on dollar-denominated sovereign debt on a case-by-case basis.

11:54 a.m. Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi returns home from Poland, bringing 20 evacuees from Ukraine in a show of Tokyo's latest support for the war-torn nation and neighboring countries.

9:56 a.m. Russia will respond proportionately to the expulsion of its diplomats from a number of Western countries, says Dmitry Medvedev, former Russian president and current deputy secretary of the country's Security Council. ""Everyone knows the answer: It will be symmetrical and destructive for bilateral relations,"" he said on his Telegram channel. ""Who have they punished? First of all, themselves.""

8:42 a.m. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he will address the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday and predicted that further and worse instances of mass killings of civilians by Russian troops would be discovered. Tuesday's Security Council session is to consider Ukrainian allegations of the murder of civilians by Russian soldiers in Bucha, northwest of Kyiv, following the discovery of hundreds of bodies, some bound and shot at close range.

4:33 a.m. A team from the International Committee of the Red Cross is detained by police during an attempt to reach the Ukrainian city of Mariupol to evacuate civilians and is being held nearby in Manhush, a spokesperson tells Reuters.

2:30 a.m. France and Germany will expel Russian diplomats in response to the alleged killings of civilians in Bucha.

Germany will declare about 40 Russian diplomats as personae non gratae, Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock says. Germany media say these diplomats will have to leave the country within five days of such a declaration.

Moscow says it will respond to Paris' decision, RIA Novosti reports.

2:05 a.m. The U.S. will work with its partners to try to suspend Russia's membership on the United Nations Human Rights Council, says Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. representative to the U.N.

The ambassador is part of an international chorus of voices denouncing Russia after new allegations of war crimes in Ukraine. Moscow denies that its forces were responsible for civilian deaths in Bucha.

12:35 a.m. U.S. President Joe Biden labels Russian President Vladimir Putin a war criminal and calls for a war crimes trial as the global outcry mounts over civilian killings in the Ukrainian town of Bucha.

""You saw what happened in Bucha,"" Biden tells reporters at the White House, referring to the discovery of a mass grave and tied bodies shot at close range. ""This warrants him -- he is a war criminal."" The Kremlin denies any accusations related to the murder of civilians, including in Bucha.

12:30 a.m. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says it will be more difficult for Ukraine to negotiate with Russia after the scale of atrocities carried out by Russian troops in occupied territories has become known. The Ukrainian leader speaks on national television from the town of Bucha in the Kyiv region, where tied bodies shot at close range, a mass grave and other signs of executions have been found in territory retaken from Russian troops.

Moscow has denied any accusations related to the killing of civilians in Bucha.

8:28 p.m. France faces a repeat of the 2017 presidential election showdown between Emmanuel Macron and far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, with Macron still favored but in a much tighter race as his lead narrows, opinion polls show ahead of the first round of voting on Sunday.

Five years ago, Macron beat Le Pen with 66.1% of the vote in the runoff, with voters of all stripes rallying behind the centrist. But the latest poll forecasts just a 53%-47% margin of victory for President Macron. Le Pen has improved her standing with a campaign focused on the declining purchasing power of middle- and lower-income voters.

5:00 p.m. Russia's chief investigator orders an official investigation into what he calls a ""provocation"" from Ukraine after Kyiv accused the Russian military of massacring civilians in the town of Bucha.

12:05 p.m. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made a surprise video appearance at the music industry's star-studded Grammy Awards celebration in Las Vegas and appealed to viewers to support his country ""in any way you can."" ""What is more opposite to music? The silence of ruined cities and killed people,"" said Zelenskyy in the video. ""Fill the silence with your music. Fill it today, to tell our story. Support us in any way you can. Any, but not silence."" He added, ""Our musicians wear body armor instead of tuxedos, they sing to the wounded, in hospitals, even to those who can't hear them, but the music will break through.""

10:10 a.m. Oil prices extend losses Monday as investors eye the release of supplies from strategic reserves from consuming nations, while a truce in Yemen could ease supply disruption concerns in the Middle East. Brent crude futures fell 79 cents, or 0.8%, to $103.60 a barrel by 0037 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was at $98.45 a barrel, down 82 cents, or 0.8%.

The United Nations has brokered a two-month truce between a Saudi-led coalition and the Houthi group aligned with Iran for the first time in the seven-year conflict. Saudi oil facilities have come under attack by the Houthis during the conflict, adding to supply disruption from Russia.

8:00 a.m. Hungary's nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban scored a fourth consecutive landslide win in Sunday's election, as voters endorsed his ambition for a conservative, ""illiberal"" state and shrugged off concerns over Budapest's close ties with Moscow. Russia's invasion of Ukraine had appeared to upend Orban's campaign, forcing him into awkward maneuvering to explain decade-old cozy business relations with President Vladimir Putin. But he mounted a successful campaign to persuade his Fidesz party's core electorate that the six-party opposition alliance of Peter Marki-Zay promising to mend ties with the European Union could lead the country into war, an accusation the opposition denied.

5:50 a.m. Pope Francis pays tribute to journalists killed during the Ukraine war, saying he hoped God would reward them for serving the common good whatever side they were on. At least six journalists have died since Russian forces invaded Ukraine in late February.

Speaking with journalists aboard the papal plane returning from Malta, Francis reiterates that he is ready to visit Kyiv but adds that he has yet to decide whether it is feasible.

12:28 a.m. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba accuses Russian forces of carrying out a ""massacre"" in the town of Bucha as images of corpses in civilian clothes left behind by departing Russian troops prompt calls from officials in Ukraine and Europe for tougher sanctions on Russia.

11:26 p.m. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken tells CNN the images of dead Ukrainian civilians found in Bucha after Russian troops left are a ""punch in the gut"" and that those responsible for any war crimes must be held accountable. Ukrainian forces had moved into the town near Kyiv and found what officials and witnesses say were the bodies of nearly 300 civilians killed by Russian troops.

Blinken would not confirm reports that the U.S. is facilitating the transfers of Soviet-era tanks to Ukrainian forces from eastern European allies, but says that there ""are or will soon be in Ukraine more than 10 anti-tank systems for every Russian tank.""

9:44 p.m. Bucha Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk shows journalists dead bodies in an area he says Chechen fighters controlled during the month that Russian forces occupied the Ukrainian city on the northern outskirts of Kyiv. One corpse appeared to have his hands bound by white cloth, and to have been shot in the mouth.

""The Russians have demonstrated that they were consciously killing civilians,"" Fedoruk alleges.

Reuters, which was taken to the scene by Ukrainian authorities, was not immediately able to verify the mayor's allegations. Russia's Defense Ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Chechnya is a region in southern Russia that has deployed troops to Ukraine to support Russian forces.

8:10 p.m. A leading rights group says it documented ""apparent war crimes"" committed by Russian military forces against civilians in Ukraine. Human Rights Watch says it found ""several cases of Russian military forces committing laws-of-war violations"" in Russian-controlled regions such as Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Kyiv.

The statement, published in Warsaw, comes one day after dead civilians were found lying scattered through the streets of Bucha, three days after the Russian army pulled back after a monthlong occupation of the area 30 km northwest of Kyiv.

7:16 p.m. Ukrainian grain exports in March were four times less than February levels, due to the Russian invasion, the economy ministry says. March grain shipments overseas included 1.1 million tons of corn, 309,000 tons of wheat and 118,000 tons of sun oil. Ukraine was the world's fourth-largest grain exporter in the 2020-21 season, according to International Grains Council data, with most of its commodities shipped out via the Black Sea.

7:00 p.m. Allegations of attacks against civilians during Russia's invasion of Ukraine must be investigated as war crimes, British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says, adding that the U.K. will fully support any such move by the International Criminal Court.

""As Russian troops are forced into retreat, we are seeing increasing evidence of appalling acts by the invading forces in towns such as Irpin and Bucha,"" Truss says in a statement, referring to places near Kyiv. ""Their indiscriminate attacks against innocent civilians during Russia's illegal and unjustified invasion of Ukraine must be investigated as war crimes.""

2:15 p.m. Russian naval forces continue to blockade the Ukrainian coast on the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, preventing resupply by sea, British military intelligence says.

1:00 p.m. Missiles struck Ukraine's southern port city of Odessa in the early hours of Sunday, the city council says in an online post. One of the city's ""critical infrastructure facilities"" was hit, regional administration spokesperson Sergey Bratchuk tells Ukraine's public broadcaster.

6:29 a.m. Russian forces want to seize east and south Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says in a late night address, adding Western nations had not provided enough anti-missile systems in their aid. Ukraine's president also heaps praise on his forces defending Mariupol, saying the fierce resistance in the besieged port city was giving the country's other cities valuable time.

4:27 a.m. Ukrainian military reports Russia is sending soldiers to Moldova's breakaway region of Transnistria, where they were preparing to launch ""provocations"" along the border, near Odessa, the Financial Times reports.

Russian troops already in Transnistria were preparing for ""a demonstration of readiness for the offensive and, possibly, hostilities against Ukraine,"" says the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

Moldova's Foreign Ministry says it is unaware of a troop buildup while officials in Transnistria deny the reports as ""completely untrue.""

3:35 a.m. Ukraine says it has seized back all areas around Kyiv, claiming complete control of the capital region for the first time since the invasion.

We had thought that invasions of other countries, savage street fighting and atomic threats were grim memories of a distant past,"" the pope says in an address to Maltese officials after arriving on the Mediterranean island nation for a two-day visit.

""However, the icy winds of war, which bring only death, destruction and hatred in their wake, have swept down powerfully upon the lives of many people and affected us all.""

A statement released by the Russian side says that Putin thanked Turkey for its assistance in hosting another round of Russia-Ukraine talks.

11:00 p.m. Friday's European Union-China summit, the first since Russia invaded Ukraine, was ""not business as usual"" and took place in a ""very sober atmosphere,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says.

""We also made very clear that China should, if not support, at least not interfere, with our sanctions,"" von der Leyen tells a news conference.

The onset of the pandemic in 2020 led to a surge in remote working and learning, which in turn fueled demand for computers.

4:00 p.m. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has recalled his country's ambassadors to Georgia and Morocco, suggesting they haven't done enough to persuade those countries to support Ukraine and punish Russia for the invasion.

Meanwhile, Washington says there are indications Vladimir Putin may be receiving inaccurate information from commanders.

""We have information that Putin felt misled by the Russian military, which has resulted in persistent tension between Putin and his military leadership,"" White House communications director Kate Bedingfield tells reporters in a briefing.

The United States and the European Union plan to impose stiff new sanctions against Russia in retaliation for its “war crimes” in Ukraine after revelations of atrocities in towns near Kyiv, including the discovery Tuesday of six burned and blackened corpses.

The new penalties by the U.S. and its allies, which will be announced Wednesday, include a ban on new investment in Russia and are intended in part to ""impose acute and immediate economic harm on Russia.""

The European Union’s executive branch on Tuesday proposed a ban on coal imports from Russia, in what would be the first sanctions targeting Moscow's lucrative energy income for its war in Ukraine. The coal imports amount to an estimated 4 billion euros ($4.4 billion) per year.

""Today we are proposing a 5th package of sanctions. To take a clear stand is crucial for the whole world,"" the E.U. Commission said in a Twitter post. ""A clear stand against Putin’s war of choice. Against the massacre of civilians.""

►French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Tuesday there is a “total determination” from all 27 E.U. countries for more severe sanctions targeting oil and coal. Europe’s dependence on Russian oil, natural gas and coal had left energy sanctions off the table amid fears the entire continent could plunge into recession.

Six charred bodies the latest grisly discovery in Bucha

The evidence of heinous acts committed in the towns around the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv gets more horrific by the day.

On Tuesday, Associated Press journalists saw six burned and blackened corpses piled together just off a residential street near a playground, the latest gruesome scene to emerge from Bucha as world leaders push for Russia to be held accountable.

One charred body had arms raised in supplication, the face contorted in a scream. The skull of another had a bullet hole in the left temple. A child's small, blackened foot could be seen in the tangle of bodies.

The circumstances regarding their death remain a mystery, but they join the growing list of atrocities discovered after Russian troops withdrew from the areas around Kyiv.

While Russian officials deny responsibility and claim the abhorrent images seen worldwide were staged, eyewitness accounts, journalists' reports and satellite imagery confirm a tale of unspeakable savagery committed upon civilians young and old.

“It’s horrible,” said Ukrainian Interior Minister Denys Monastyrsky at the scene.

Pentagon pledges anti-tank missiles

The Pentagon announced late Tuesday that $100 million worth of Javelin anti-tank missiles will be sent to Ukraine to meet an urgent need, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement.

The missiles have helped Ukrainian forces mount a fierce, effective resistance to Russian troops who invaded Ukraine in late February.

The White House has sent $1.7 billion in military aid since then.

Biden to ban investment in Russia as part of new sanctions package

The Biden administration will announce new sanctions Wednesday that include a ban on new investment in Russia in response to atrocities in Ukraine, among them recent revelations of barbaric acts in the town of Bucha that “show further evidence of war crimes,” according to sources familiar with the decision.

The penalties, made in coordination with G7 and European Union allies, also involve increased sanctions on financial institutions and state-owned enterprises and also on Russian government officials and their family members.

A Biden administration official said the measures are designed to “degrade key instruments of Russian state power, impose acute and immediate economic harm on Russia, and hold accountable the Russian kleptocracy that funds and supports Putin’s war.”

As a result of sanctions on Russia following President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, Russia’s economy is forecast to contract as much as 15% or more in 2022, according to the official.

“The financial system in Russia is near the brink of collapse,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said, defending the effectiveness of sanctions to date. “It is more and more difficult for President Putin to fund this war every single day. That has an impact.”

Biden on Monday called for a war crimes trial for Putin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy detailed the carnage in towns around Kyiv during an address to NATO on Tuesday, accusing Russian troops of killing “entire families, adults and children.”

Milley urges US to build new bases in Eastern Europe

The U.S. should establish permanent bases with rotating forces in new Eastern European locations as a hedge against Russian aggression, the top U.S military officer told Congress on Tuesday.

Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the bases could be funded by other countries such as Poland and the Baltic nations — Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania -- that want more U.S. troops to provide protection from Russia. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said any effort to expand security in Eastern Europe is a “work in progress” that probably will be discussed at the NATO summit in June.

“I believe that a lot of our European allies, especially those such as the Baltics or Poland and Romania, and elsewhere — they’re very, very willing to establish permanent bases,'' Milley said. ""They’ll build them, they’ll pay for them.”

Zelenskyy urges UN to punish Russia for war crimes

In his address to the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reiterated that Russia had committed war crimes and said the U.N. must hold Russia leaders accountable to show other potential war criminals ""how they will be punished if the biggest one is punished.""

He also called for soldiers who savagely attacked civilians – and those who issued the orders – to face trial for the apparent massacre by Russian forces in and around Kyiv and other major cities.

The Russian military killed ""anyone who served our country,"" Zelenskyy said Tuesday. Women were shot outside their homes as they searched for friends and loves ones, he said, and some were raped in front of their children. Zelenskyy reaffirmed that Ukrainian forces that retook cities found mass graves, revelations of atrocities and infrastructure destroyed by Russian forces.

""They killed entire families, adults and children, and they tried to burn their bodies,"" said Zelenskyy, who urged the U.N. to provide security guarantees to Ukraine. Since Russia holds veto power, though, the Security Council will be unable to act.

However, there is growing momentum in Europe to ban Russian coal, and possibly to impose sanctions on imports of its oil and natural gas, which could deliver a major blow to the struggling Russian economy.

Ukraine says satellite images reveal brutality of Russian forces

Satellite images taken weeks ago of the town of Bucha outside Kyiv show bodies of civilians on a street, undercutting the Russian claims that Ukrainian forces staged the scene when they retook the city, Reuters reported.

Maxar Technologies provided nine images taken of Bucha on March 18, 19 and 31 to Reuters, and at least four of the images appear to show bodies on the street. Ukraine forces took back the city last week.

Ukraine says 410 dead civilians were found in Kyiv-area towns recently retaken from Russian forces. In Bucha, 280 people were buried in mass graves, according to Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The Ukrainian prosecutor-general’s office has described one room discovered in Bucha as a “torture chamber.”

Zelenskyy told the U.N. Security Council that satellite images show what really happened during the attacks on Bucha, adding, ""we can conduct full and transparent investigations.""

Atrocities near Kyiv fuel global outrage. Will it be a tipping point in the war?

Human Rights Watch: Russia using banned mines

Russian forces are using banned anti-personnel mines as they pull back from cities in Ukraine, a Human Rights Watch report says.

Russia is using a device known as the Pom-3 Medallion, a mine capable of killing people within a 50-foot radius, Human Rights Watch said.

The 1997 International Mine Ban Treaty prohibits the manufacture and use of antipersonnel mines. Ukraine is one of 164 nations that signed the treaty. The United States and Russia have not signed it.

""They are mining all this territory,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video address. ""Mining houses, equipment, even the bodies of killed people. Too many tripwire mines, too many other dangers."" Read more here.

1.2 billion global citizens left vulnerable by war's disruption

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres addressed the Security Council before Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday, saying the world is ""dealing with a full-fledged invasion"" in violation of the U.N. Charter.

The result: More than 10 million Ukrainians have fled their homes and more than 4 million of them have fled the country.

The war's victims, Guterres said, also include more than 1.2 billion citizens of developing nations struggling with rising prices and other economic issues aggravated by the war.

""It is more urgent by the day to silence the guns,"" Guterres said.

Website links Ukraine refugees with hosts around the globe

A group of Harvard University students have created a website to help Ukrainian refugees find housing around the world.

Ukrainetakeshelter.com, created by Avi Schiffmann and Marco Burstein, encourages everyone with space in their homes to post a listing. Refugees and hosts must provide identity verification either through government issued ID card or passport. Over 18,000 prospective hosts have signed up on the site. On a recent day, Burstein and Schiffman logged 800,000 users.

Burstein said he, Schiffman and Irish software engineer Daniel Conlon have been ""blown away"" by the response.

“We’ve heard all sorts of amazing stories of hosts and refugees getting connected all over the world,” Burstein said. “We have hosts in almost any country you can imagine from Hungary and Romania and Poland to Canada to Australia.""

State Department calls atrocities part of a 'broader, troubling campaign'

The credible reports of torture, rape and civilian executions in Ukraine are probably not the acts of rogue soldiers, State Department spokesman Ned Price said Monday.

'“They are part of a broader, troubling campaign,” he said at a State Department briefing.

Price said the world has been shocked by “the horrifying images of the Kremlin's brutality” in Bucha and other cities near Kyiv. Civilians, many with their hands tied, were apparently executed in the streets.

Others were dumped in mass graves. As they’ve retreated, Russians have also left behind land mines and booby traps to injure more Ukrainians and slow recovery, Price said.

The apparent atrocities will be one of the topics of discussion when Secretary of State Antony Blinken meets with his NATO counterparts in Belgium this week.

Allies are already discussing additional sanctions and ways to help Ukraine document war crimes for a criminal prosecution, Price said. The U.S. has contributed both money and manpower to help Ukraine’s prosecutor general compile a case.

German president admits mistakes with Russia

Germany’s president is admitting mistakes in policy toward Russia in his previous job as foreign minister. President Frank-Walter Steinmeier served twice as foreign minister, most recently from 2013 to 2017, and pursued dialogue with Russian President Vladimir Putin to cultivate energy ties. Russia provides Germany with about one-third of it oil and gas and more than half its coal.

Ukraine and Polish officials have criticized Steinmeier for being too close to Russia. Ukraine's ambassador to Berlin boycotted a peace concert with Russian artists organized by Steinmeier.

Steinmeier told ZDF television Tuesday that “we failed on many points,” including efforts to encourage Russia toward democracy and respecting human rights.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said fresh sanctions from the West would not be ""enough"" to respond to the atrocities Ukrainians say have been committed in the town of Bucha, near Kyiv, where grisly images purportedly show slain civilians.

""There will definitely be a new sanctions package against Russia,"" Zelenskyy said in a video address Sunday night. ""But I'm sure that's not enough,"" he said as he made an impassioned plea for a stronger international response to Russia's invasion.

Residents of Bucha have accused Russian forces of targeting civilians in a deadly campaign that Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk said left more than 300 people dead before troops pulled out of the city. Russia's Defense Ministry has denied the claims, calling them a ""provocation,"" despite photographs and video showing damaged city streets strewn with dead bodies.

Meanwhile, in southern Ukraine, heavy fighting has continued in the besieged port city of Mariupol, according to Britain's defense ministry. It said as efforts to evacuate residents from the besieged city were set to continue Monday.

As Russian forces have retreated around Kyiv, Ukrainian forces have gained ground in the country’s northeast and south. The southern city of Mariupol has been encircled and under siege by Russian troops for weeks, but has not been captured. Neither has another southern coastal city, Mykolaiv, also a target of Russian attacks. Dueling artillery battles have become the norm as infantry forces on both sides dig in.

But even though Russia was plagued by low morale, logistical problems and casualties, its units, for the most part, did not surrender en masse or flee.

The Russian failure boiled down to one point, analysts said: doing too much at once.

“Eventually it became clear their initial campaign was a completely unworkable military strategy,” Mr. Kofman said. “They were competing along axes of advancement, and they were basically advancing in opposite directions on the way. There was no way they were going to succeed.”

'Failing that, the only option left to us is to put the predators to sleep,' he said, describing it as 'the only option'.

'It is unimaginably painful to talk about this, but the main priority now is the lives of people.'

He added on a video: 'After yesterday's massive shelling by missiles and planes, the [zoo] is practically destroyed.

'One more shelling - and the lions, tigers, bears, distraught with fear, may be free and go towards Kharkiv or to nearby villages,' said zoo owner Alexander Feldman (pictured)

Mr Feldman said that 'after yesterday's massive shelling by missiles and planes, the [zoo] is practically destroyed'

The zoo owner added that he will try to save 'the little jaguars' and 'little panthers' if possible

'The aviaries have been destroyed. All the infrastructure has been destroyed.

'By some miracle, the tigers and lions have survived. Their cages are badly damaged.

'By tonight, we will decide either to put the bears to sleep or move them. If there are any ideas, maybe we will save some and try to save the little jaguars.

'Maybe we will save little panthers. But all the other animals are likely to be destroyed.'

The owner of the popular zoo said: 'Feldman Ecopark no longer exists. Now this can be said quite definitely.

'Yesterday and today it was again subjected to massive shelling and bombardment. Infrastructure destroyed, enclosures destroyed.'

Shelling on 17 March killed two two orangutans and chimpanzees. Two days later nine deer were slaughtered and 20 escaped to the woods.

Last week a video showed kangaroos being transported to a new home from Feldman Ecopark.

A van driver fleeing with the frightened kangaroos had said: 'It is one month since the war began and we keep evacuating the animals.'

'These kangaroos are already safe,' said the zoo. 'This is very good, because their enclosures, unfortunately, were repeatedly shelled. We believe that now they will be fine.'

A statement said: 'Many thanks to volunteers and employees who take risks to save animals, as well as to our many friends - caring people, businesses and non-governmental organisations who help us financially and make our rescue operations possible.

'Your support truly saves lives.'

A van driver fleeing with the frightened kangaroos had said: 'It is one month since the war began and we keep evacuating the animals'

While the kangaroos were saved from Feldman Ecopark, sadly some have been killed in the attacks.

'We cannot avoid tragedies,' a spokesman said at the time. 'Four fallow deer and three Welsh goats became victims of another barbaric shelling.

'The list of victims of aggression among our pets is growing - it already includes large cats, primates, ungulates, marsupials, and birds...Feldman Ecopark has been on the line of fire for the last month.'

The zoo once had more than 300 species.

It comes as the Ukrainian emergency services posted photos of dead animals in Chernihiv, suggesting domestic creatures were killed by Russian troops as shells littered the region.

The post said: 'Chernihiv region, our land is unhappy...Shells in every cellar, in every nook and cranny...Poor demilitarized domestic dogs and cows that did not threaten anyone.'

'Unlike us humans, animals do not feel hatred for these creatures that came to our Ukraine for one purpose only. And even they, these cows and dogs, were destroyed.

'This is the whole Russian army - killing women, children, animals.'

The White House referred to the weapons in a fact sheet on the aid package as “100 Tactical Unmanned Aerial Systems.” NBC News reported exclusively Tuesday that this move was under consideration.

There are two variants of the weapon, the Switchblade 300 and the 600, that have been sold to U.S. Special Operations Command by manufacturer AeroVironment, based in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. The 300 is designed for pinpoint strikes on personnel, and the larger 600 is meant to destroy tanks and other armored vehicles. The Congressional officials did not have clarity on which variant would be provided to Ukraine, or whether both would be.

NBC News reported on an exclusive demonstration of the Switchblade 300 in December. AeroVironment officials said at the time that the government forbade them from demonstrating the 600.

AeroVironment officials did not respond to requests for comment.

“We stand with our allies and sovereign nations in their right to protect their homelands and their very lives when this fundamental right is threatened,” the company said in a statement on its website headlined “AeroVironment stands with the people of Ukraine and all of NATO.”

The Switchblades are essentially robotic smart bombs, equipped with cameras, guidance systems and explosives. They can be programmed to automatically strike targets miles away, and they can be steered around objectives until the time is right to strike. The company says the 600 can fly for 40 minutes and up to 50 miles.

They are single-use weapons, which is why they have been dubbed “kamikaze drones.” But they are orders of magnitude cheaper than the Hellfire missiles fired by U.S. Reaper drones. The 300 can cost as little as $6,000, by some estimates.

Both weapons can be set up in minutes and launched from tubes. They fly much faster than the Turkish Bayraktar TB2 drones that Ukraine has been using to inflict damage on Russia, and presumably they would be able to penetrate the spotty air defenses Russia is maintaining over its forces.

If the Switchblade is used in Ukraine, it would be the most significant use of the weapon in combat to date. The U.S. military used the Switchblade in combat under limited circumstances in Afghanistan and elsewhere but has not publicized that fact, sources familiar with the matter have said.

Many questions remain about the proposed arrangement with Ukraine, including how many of the missiles the U.S. has in its stockpiles, how fast AeroVironment can manufacture new ones and how much training Ukrainians would require to operate the systems.

The United Kingdom is the only foreign country that so far has been authorized to purchase the Switchblade.",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/ukraine-asks-biden-admin-armed-drones-jamming-gear-surface-air-missile-rcna20197

Ukraine's military published several videos it says show its prized Bayraktar TB2 drones at work destroying targets controlled by Russian forces.

Over the weekend, the Ukrainian army commander-in-chief's Facebook page posted five clips showing the strikes, though giving little detail of the exact locations or targets.

The drones have been hailed as a game-changer by the Ukrainian military, and have been credited with destroyed large numbers of Russian armored vehicles, gaining heroic status among the Ukrainian people.

The videos have been keenly recieved, amassing some 1.2 million Facebook views as of Monday, with many reposted on other networks to vast audiences. Insider was unable to verify the footage, or the named targets.

The first, dated March 12, purported to show the destruction of a Russian electronic warfare system near Kyiv.

""Our Bayraktar TB2 operators masterfully 'tested' the enemy's electronic warfare system in the Kyiv region,"" said its caption.

The footage appears to have been taken with a camera held close to a monitor screen, a common format for Ukraine's Bayraktar videos. Someone's reflection could be seen and a buzz of chatter was also recorded.

Another 18-second video posted on Saturday said one of the drones had destroyed a multiple rocket launcher.

""Bayraktars in action!"" the post said. ""Hundreds of saved lives of our fellow citizens, especially civilians!""

Later that day, a third video post claimed a Bayraktar had taken out a Russian army command post:

Neither of those videos gave a location.

A final video dated March 13 claimed to show the destruction of an artillery fire control point — a system to coordinate and direct ranged weapons.

Ukraine had between five and 20 of the drones in service before the invasion, according to The New York Times.

The drones can reach altitudes of 25,000 feet and fly for 27 continuous hours, per their manufacturers.

They can be operated remotely from up to 300 km away, with each one capable of bearing four laser-guided bombs or rockets, for a total payload of some 150 kilograms.

The first video was shared online on Sunday morning and appears to show rockets being fired at three armoured vehicles in the Ukrainian south-eastern city of Mariupol.

The aerial footage, which was circulated by several unverified accounts, shows a BTR-82 APC and KamAZ-63968 'Typhoon' vehicle being targeted successfully. It is not clear when the strike took place.

The BTR-82A is an advanced 8x8 wheeled armoured personnel carrier (APC) being manufactured by in Russia for use by the armies of Russia and Kazakhstan.

The second video footage was also shared online on Sunday and shows a drone strike on a Russian command centre in southern Ukraine.

The footage was released by the Ukrainian Army who said it shows the Russian command and control center destroyed near Vasylivka, in the Mykolaiv region by a Bayraktar drone.

It is unknown if or how many casualties there were involved in both strikes on Russian forces.

It comes as Russia escalated attacks in western Ukraine on Sunday with a deadly airstrike on a military base where Ukrainian troops had trained with NATO forces, bringing the conflict closer to Poland and prompting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to renew his pleas for a no-fly zone.

Zelenskyy called Sunday a 'black day,' and said none of the activities at the military base would have threatened Russian territory.

Explosions have been heard on the outskirts of the western Ukrainian city of Lviv after Russian forces launched an attack on a military base just 12 miles from the Polish border, killing at least nine people and injuring dozens more.

According to Ukrainian sources, Vladimir Putin's forces had launched a missile strike on the International Center for Peacekeeping and Security, also known as Yavoriv military complex, just before 6am this morning.

Initial reports suggested the base had been targeted by eight missiles, but Maksym Kozytskyi, Governor of the region later confirmed 30 cruise missiles had been fired, killing 35 people and injuring 134.

An American journalist was also killed Sunday and another injured when their vehicle came under fire from Russian forces outside Kyiv.

Meanwhile, continued fighting in multiple regions caused more misery throughout Ukraine and has provoked international outrage.

Now in its third week, the war has forced more than 2.5 million people to flee Ukraine. Thousands of civilians and soldiers have been killed.

Meanwhile, the death toll in the strategic southern port city of Mariupol, facing acute deprivation amid a prolonged siege, has topped 2,000, officials there said.

Efforts continued to get help to Mariupol, which aid agencies say is facing a humanitarian catastrophe.

A humanitarian column headed there had to turn back again on Sunday, a city official said, after the Russians 'did not stop firing'.

A total of 2,187 residents have now died in days of relentless Russian bombardment, the city council said Sunday.

'The enemy is holding the city hostage by performing real acts of genocide,' said Ukraine Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov.

Zelensky has accused Moscow of both blocking and attacking humanitarian convoys, although he said Sunday that another 125,000 people had been evacuated that way across Ukraine.

'Russians are bombing the city even during official negotiations,' Defence Minister Reznikov said. 'They have no dignity, no honor, no mercy.'

Talks between the two sides have yet to yield a ceasefire, but Ukrainian and Russian representatives will meet via video-conference Monday, a Zelensky adviser and a Kremlin spokesman both said.

'And our goal is that in this struggle, in this difficult negotiating work, Ukraine will get the necessary result... for peace and for security,' Zelensky said early Monday.

'We see significant progress,' Leonid Slutsky, a senior member of Russia's negotiating team, told state-run television network RT Sunday.

It comes after the Ukrainian President visited wounded soldiers at a military hospital in Kiev on Sunday to boost their morale and award them medals for their bravery.

'Guys, get well soon. I believe that the best gift for your statement will be our common victory!' said Zelensky, according to an English translation of a tweet posted by the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine.

The Ukrainian government and military forces have shared a number of videos and images showing significant damage inflicted on Russian troops with Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2s during the war in Ukraine. Now the Russian Ministry of Defense has followed suit and also released several of their own videos showing Russian drones being used for reconnaissance, surveillance, and offensive purposes in Ukraine.

On the eighth day of the war, the Russian Ministry of Defense posted the first verified drone footage to its social media account. The command and observation post of the Aidar battalion, an assault battalion of the Ukrainian Ground Forces, was hit by a Kornet (9M133FM-3) ATGM-like missile fired by a Russian-made Orion-E MALE UCAV, according to a video released on March 4. The footage also revealed that the Orion-E UCAV’s electro-optical sensor had poor image quality and that the sensor remained inactive for some time after the ordnance detonated.

The Russian Federation’s Ministry of Defense released the second piece of footage showing a drone destroying a target in Ukraine on March 11. A structure described by the defense ministry as “the fortified castle of Ukrainian nationalists” was hit by a Russian Aerospace Forces drone in the footage. While the ministry stated that the drone hit the target with precision-guided munitions from a height of around 4 km, it did not specify which drone fired it.

On March 13, the Russian Ministry of Defense released additional footage of a Ukrainian multiple launch rocket system being destroyed, possibly with the Forpost-R, a drone developed from Israel’s IAI Searcher II. “A multiple launch rocket system was destroyed by a Russian Air Force unmanned aerial vehicle using high-precision munitions from a height of over 3,000 meters,” was the statement from the Russian Ministry of Defense.

Although the ministry claimed that a Ukrainian MLRS was destroyed, the quality of the footage makes this difficult to corroborate. Probably for this reason, the Ministry’s footage shows a pair of PGMs (precision-guided munitions) mounted under the Forpost-R drone’s two wings upon takeoff, but no ordnance during landing.

Aside from videos showing Russian drones being used offensively, the Russian Ministry of Defense also provided footage of drones being used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. In drone footage posted on March 11, the ministry claimed that Ukrainian nationalists prevented the evacuation of cars carrying civilians from the city via the humanitarian aid corridor. On March 13, the ministry released footage of a Russian Armed Forces artillery strike during the destruction of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ field command post with a Krasnopol high-precision shell. The footage released by the ministry on March 14, possibly taken from an Orlan-10 drone showed the destruction of MLRSs belonging to the Ukrainian Armed Forces and a Ukrainian ammunition depot by a missile strike.

According to official and unofficial videos and images, Russia has used Orion-E UCAVs developed by Kronstadt Group in Russia, the Russian licensed version of Israel’s IAI Searcher II UAV, Forpost-R UAVs, Russian made Orlan-10 UAVs for reconnaissance and electronic warfare, short-range Eleron-3 UAVs designed by the Russian industry, and KUB-BLA kamikaze UAVs in Ukraine.

So far, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense has stated that Russia has lost a total of ten drones, but no official announcement has been made concerning the drone models. According to unconfirmed photographs from the army, the drones that were shot down were mostly Forpost-R, Orlan-10, and KUB-BLA kamikaze drones. A Russian drone was allegedly shot down by Ukrainian air defenses after ‘flying into Polish airspace’ in violation of NATO territory, according to 24 TV News. Poland has yet to issue an official statement regarding the incident. Because Poland is a NATO member, a violation like this might result in a substantial escalation of the current crisis.

Despite having far more drone command and control capabilities and experience than Ukraine, Russia has seemingly struggled to effectively coordinate these systems in the war in Ukraine. While our picture of the conflict and the weapon systems in use is relatively incomplete the Russian Ministry of Defense’s footage does not appear to be sufficient to compete with Ukraine’s successful TB2 drone campaign.",https://www.overtdefense.com/2022/03/15/russia-releases-footage-of-drones-being-utilized-in-the-war-in-ukraine/

The Bayraktar TB2 combat drone has earned its spurs in the skies over Ukraine – thrilling the operators while taking out tanks and artillery pieces – plus other armored vehicles.

The Ukrainian military has released numerous black and white videos that appear to come from the Bayraktar’s camera. This footage shows the drone’s missiles hitting paydirt in spectacular explosions that then go viral. The unmanned vehicle looks to continue to bring the fight to the Russians and make their invasion even more costly.

Additional Targets Beyond Armored Vehicles

If the videos on social media are indeed authentic, it is evidence that the Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 is playing an expanding role in the war. New footage is showing the drone attacking bridges and Russian command and control centers, not just tanks and armored vehicles.

Positive Psychological Effects of Successful Drone Strikes

Military analysts have noticed that the drone’s success can give a boost to Ukrainian morale and also dismay and frustrate the Russians due to their failures in air defense.

Time interviewed Arda Mevlütoğlu, a Turkish military and aerospace analyst. He replied that the “footage released by the Ukraine military shows serious defects in Russian air defense cover, which is a surprise for many observers. The footage is also very useful for public relations and psychological warfare.”

The Russians are continuing to use unprotected convoys of support and logistics vehicles to supply the front lines and the Bayraktar TB2 is eliminating these trucks that are carrying fuel, ammunition, and food.

Bayraktar Drones Are Popular Around the World

The Ukrainians have an estimated 50 drones that they have bought since 2019. They are made by Turkish defense firm Baykar Technology and more of the combat drones have been ordered by the Ukrainians since the invasion. 16 countries have bought the unmanned vehicle.

The Bayraktar carries four Smart Micro Munition laser-guided missiles. It can remain in the air for up to 30 hours and flies at altitudes from 18,000 to 25,000 feet. The range of the drone is 185 miles. It’s not a fast aircraft, flying at only 80 miles per hour. It has two different kinds of cameras plus laser range-finders and laser pointer.

The Unmanned Vehicles Have Survivability

Surprisingly, the drones have not been as detectable to Russian air defenses. As Saikiran Kannan of India Today has described it, “Key aspects like low visibility and detectability, thanks to the low radar cross-section values of the TB2 and the ability to have the datalink complexes stay below the electromagnetic jamming envelopes of principal Russian electronic warfare systems like Krasukha-4, have made the TB2 drones slick and agile,” Kannan wrote.

The Bayraktar is having success, but the Ukrainians need more of the drones. Additional operators must be trained to pilot the aircraft. New units will likely be deployed around Kyiv and other besieged cities.

While drones have been utilized by the United States for targeted assassinations against individual leaders during the war on terror, this is one of the first times, outside the Azerbaijan and Armenia matchup in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, that unmanned conflict has been decisive in mechanized maneuver war.

Are Tanks Becoming Obsolete?

This is a significant development in 21st-century warfare, and it is making the use of main battle tanks almost obsolete as they struggle against anti-armor portable missiles and drone strikes. The Russians will have to improve their performance of early warning radar and anti-aircraft systems to reduce the effectiveness against drone attacks. But it appears now that the Bayraktar is winning.

The alliance has repeatedly refused the request out of fear that this would mean engaging in a direct confrontation with Russia. Yet, with dozens of Ukrainians being killed by Russian aerial attacks each day, there are still many ways in which NATO can help Ukraine protect itself.

Firstly, Ukraine desperately needs fighter aircraft, as Russia has a significant advantage in military aviation. The simplest option would be to transfer Soviet-era Su-27 and MiG-29 fighters to Ukraine, dozens of which are in service in Poland, Bulgaria, and Romania. NATO countries are currently discussing this but, unfortunately, have not yet provided aircraft to Ukraine. This appears to be because Ukraine’s eastern European allies are unwilling to weaken their own air forces. Therefore, the United States can now increase its deployments of fighter jets to Poland, Bulgaria, and Romania to address their concerns and clear the way for them to transfer aircraft to Ukraine. In any case, it will be important for NATO to deploy more combat aircraft on its eastern flank to deter further Russian aggression.

Polish MiG-29 fighters can help compensate for the losses the Ukrainian Air Force has suffered due to Russian missile attacks on its bases. Ukrainian pilots have proven their ability to protect their airspace with fighter jets (including MiG-29s): Ukrainian Air Force Command reports that its fighters have shot down more than a dozen Russian aircraft during the first two weeks of the war.

Ukraine also needs more anti-aircraft missile systems and man-portable air defence systems (MANPADS). The former will help the country protect critical military and civilian infrastructure from Russian bombers flying at high altitudes, as well as missiles. The latter will help it protect Ukrainian troops and cities from Russian helicopters, fighters, and bombers that are flying at low altitudes in an attempt to evade air defence systems.

While Ukraine is already receiving Stinger MANPADS from its Western partners, it will need more of these so that it can use them on all fronts. But the country is still waiting to receive anti-aircraft missile systems. It would likely take the Ukrainian military too long to learn to use NATO anti-aircraft systems and to solve the technical issues of integrating them into its forces. And NATO would see it as too risky to deploy its own personnel to operate these systems. Accordingly, the alliance can provide Ukraine with Soviet-era S-300 air defence systems from Slovakia and Greece. The Ukrainian army has successfully used S-300s against Russian aircraft and missiles many times.

Ukrainians hope that their Western friends will continue to supply Ukraine with anti-tank missile systems such as Javelins and Next Generation Light Anti-tank Weapons, as well as ammunition for these systems. Thanks to these portable anti-tank missiles, some of which were handed to Ukraine before the large-scale Russian invasion, Ukrainian troops contained an onslaught of Russian armoured vehicles: by 15 March, Russia had reportedly lost 404 tanks and 1,279 armoured protected vehicles. But Russia still has many more tanks, armoured personnel carriers, and infantry fighting vehicles. So, Ukrainian forces need the tools to destroy them – especially given that the Kremlin is trying to win simply by deploying huge numbers of vehicles and soldiers on every front.

Ukraine has also used unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to great effect. This is particularly true of its dozens of Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2s – which have caused significant damage to Russian forces, as one can see from the numerous videos of Ukrainian UAV strikes online. But the Ukrainian army will need more combat UAVs if it is to cover every front effectively and to destroy Russian air defences, artillery, and support columns on a large scale.

The Ukrainian military also needs to accelerate its programmes to train soldiers to use other types of UAVs that are in service with NATO countries. If the war becomes a protracted conflict (as seems likely), the alliance can supply Ukraine with significantly more UAVs. These systems would allow Ukraine not to risk the lives of so many soldiers in combat missions. The protection of personnel is an important part of the strategy of the Ukrainian Armed Forces – which, unlike the Russian military, do not use soldiers as cannon fodder.

Overall, the quickest and easiest step for NATO countries would probably be to transfer their Soviet-era weapons to Ukraine. Post-communist NATO countries in central and eastern Europe have a significant number of artillery pieces, armoured vehicles, mortars, and small arms dating back to Soviet times. Many of them no longer need these weapons. Ukrainian soldiers would not need additional training to use these weapons.

As it stands, many more Ukrainians want to defend their country than have the weapons to do so. Territorial defence units suffer from a shortage of small arms and a total lack of armoured vehicles. Therefore, a simple transfer of Soviet-era weapons from NATO countries would significantly increase Ukraine’s ability to resist the Russian offensive.

At the same time, NATO members that are not ready to supply Ukraine with weapons can provide ammunition, bulletproof vests, helmets, and modern means of secure communication. They can also supply Ukraine with night-vision devices, which might be especially useful given that Russian forces have proved to be vulnerable to night attacks.

Ukraine desperately needs fighter aircraft, as Russia has a significant advantage in military aviation

Ukrainians greatly appreciate all the military assistance that the West continues to provide to Ukraine. That support played a huge role in breaking the Kremlin’s blitzkrieg and inflicting significant losses on Russian forces. However, the Russian military has far more manpower and equipment than Ukrainian forces, especially in military aviation. Therefore, NATO countries will need to markedly increase their supplies of arms, including advanced weapons systems, to Ukraine. Ukrainians will require greater military support from the West if they are to ensure that this is the last war of its kind in Europe.

23,5f670b8d-94d6-48df-b643-a8f1d0ad776e,[],2022-04-06 00:00:00,"M AN-PORTABLE AIR DEFENCE SYSTEMS (MANPADS) are playing an unexpectedly important role in the war in Ukraine. These shoulder-fired missiles, typified by the American Stinger, are only effective against low-flying aircraft and at a range of a few kilometres. But they have scored a number of kills and are severely impeding Russian air operations. Now Ukrainian forces are getting an upgrade, in the form of the latest STARStreak missiles supplied by Britain. Why are MANPADS crucial to Ukraine’s defence, and what difference might the new missiles make?

Military analysts were puzzled when Russia failed to knock out the Ukrainian network of long-range, radar-guided S-300 surface-to-air missiles at the outset of the war. Though some have been destroyed, other S-300s continue to operate, forcing Russian aircraft to fly at low altitudes to avoid radar detection. And whereas NATO helicopters have mast-mounted sights that allow them to fire guided missiles from long range, Russian attack helicopters tend to carry pods of unguided rockets, behaving like slower ground-attack aircraft that must fly forward while attacking. Both of these factors put Russian aircraft in the sights of MANPADS.

Originating in the 1950s, MANPADS use infra-red seekers to home in on the hot exhaust pipes of jet engines. This is why aircraft and helicopters fire out fans of decoy flares, to distract such missiles with brighter and more attractive heat sources. Early MANPADS could only lock on to an aircraft from behind. These include the Soviet-era Strela (or SA-7, as NATO calls it) which Germany is supplying to Ukraine from old East German stocks. More modern missiles, such as the Igla (or SA-18) and the Stinger (which was developed in the 1980s), can be fired at an aircraft from any direction. However they may not be fast enough to catch a receding aircraft before it disappears out of range.

Modern heat-seeking missiles also have limitations. The Stinger missile seeker requires cooling, and a battery unit provides power for only 45 seconds, so it cannot be left continuously ready. The seeker head takes between three and five seconds to reach operating temperature after being turned on, an agonising delay when under attack. Once the Stinger is live, the weapon must identify the aircraft’s engine heat and lock on. And once fired, the missile may be thwarted by decoy flares or other countermeasures, or the pilot may manage to break the lock-on by pulling a sharp turn. A Stinger flies at about twice the speed of sound and carries a one-kilo explosive warhead fused to explode on impact. That is not necessarily enough to destroy an aircraft but almost certainly enough to force it back to base.

The battlefield effectiveness of the Stinger is highly contested. Its main use in action was by mujahideen in Afghanistan in their fight against the Soviet Union. Their reports of a 79% success rate may have been intended to convince their American backers to keep supplying the weapons. The reality may have been more like 20%.

The STARStreak is somewhat different. Ukraine received its first one in mid-March. Whereas the Stinger is battle-proven, this will be STARStreak’s debut in combat. The weapon was developed in the 1980s, though the latest version, STARStreak II, was first demonstrated in 2008. STARStreak is unusual in not being a heat-seeker but a “beam-rider”: the operator holds the target in the cross-hairs and the missile follows, guided by a laser beam. A disadvantage is that the operator has to follow the target. But that makes it in effect immune to decoys, countermeasures and evasion. If you can see it, you can hit it.

STARStreak’s makers call it a “high-velocity missile” to draw attention to its speed of more than Mach 3, which makes it much harder to evade. And rather than Stinger’s single warhead, STARStreak releases three tungsten darts, each weighing 900 grams. These spread out and fly in formation, all following the laser guidance, increasing the chance of a hit. The darts can pierce helicopter armour and explode after penetration, causing far more damage than a surface explosion.

It may be that this ultra-modern weapon proves too complex or fails to match expectations. However, reports from Ukraine suggest that a STARStreak has already brought down a Russian Mi-28 helicopter. Ukraine’s government has repeatedly asked NATO to impose a no-fly zone. It will almost certainly not get one. But STARStreak missiles, and MANPADS more generally, could help Ukrainian forces to neutralise Russian airpower without the need for new jets or direct intervention by other states.

BBC News Published 18 March

Image source, Getty Images Image caption, A Ukrainian soldier holding a Javelin anti-tank missile system during exercises in 2021

The burnt-up wreckage of a Russian tank lies in the dirt, while in an accompanying photo next to it, a Ukrainian soldier carries the armaments said to have caused the destruction.

The images posted to Twitter by the Ukrainian Armed Forces are labelled with a triumphant caption, declaring that this was the result of ""hits from Javelins on [Russian] military equipment"".

The Javelin, a shoulder-held anti-tank weapon that shoots heat-seeking rockets hurtling towards targets up to 4km (2.5 miles) away, can be controlled by a portable unit that doesn't look much different from a video game console - but can send a metre-long projectile straight through the side or top of an armoured tank.

The very presence of the American-made weapons ""causes panic"" among Russian troops, the Ukrainian military claims - and it is about to get 2,000 more of them.

Javelin missiles are among the items promised to Ukraine by the US in a new $800m (£608.3m) military assistance package announced by President Joe Biden on Wednesday.

Other armaments include drones that can be turned into flying bombs and anti-aircraft weapons that can shoot helicopters from the sky.

But will these shipments help Ukraine overcome Russia's more numerous - and better equipped - invasion force?

What will the US send to Ukraine?

The new US aid for Ukraine includes a wide range of military equipment, ranging from 25,000 sets each of body armour and helmets to rifles and grenade launchers, thousands of other anti-tank weapons and more than 20m rounds of ammunition.

Besides Javelin missiles, the most powerful weapons include 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems, once famously used to shoot down Soviet planes in Afghanistan.

The US also plans to ship 100 ""tactical unmanned aerial systems"" - small drones - which are often hand-launched and small enough to fit into rucksacks.

Soldiers can use them to scope out the battlefield or, in some cases, to attack, essentially creating flying bombs that can be flown into targets from a distance.

Mr Biden's announcement on Wednesday brings the total amount of US military aid pledged for Ukraine to $1bn in the past week alone - a huge acceleration when compared to the $2.7bn provided between 2014 and the start of 2022.

It is a ""significant development"" and addresses previous shortfalls, according to John Herbst, a former US ambassador in Kyiv.

""There's no question that [Biden] and his team have been too timid in providing support for Ukraine,"" Mr Herbst said. ""And they have responded to that pressure.""

What will this mean against Russian ground and air offensives?

Military experts say that the US-supplied anti-tank weapons are likely to have the most impact in Ukraine.

The invading Russian forces ""are primarily mechanised forces"" - meaning armoured convoys - so ""the best thing you can do is take them [vehicles] out"", said former US Army Colonel Christopher Mayer.

Ukraine has received a variety of anti-tank systems from several countries, which helps increase the ""lethality"" of Ukraine's forces against Russian vehicles, Mr Mayer said.

""If you give them a variety of anti-tank systems, it provides them with multiple opportunities to punch through whatever particular defensive armour protection systems that tank has,"" he said.

And while their claims can't be independently verified, Ukrainian officials say they are putting the weapons to good effect. As of 16 March, they claim to have destroyed more than 400 tanks and over 2,000 other Russian vehicles.

Anti-tank weapons, however, do nothing to help Ukraine combat Russia's air force, which for three weeks has been striking targets across the country.

The man-portable, shoulder-fired Stinger system is the only anti-aircraft weapon included in the US aid package.

The system has been seen in conflicts around the world since 1981. It was most famously used in Afghanistan, where US-supplied Stingers helped bring down hundreds of Russian aircraft and helicopters during the Soviet occupation.

Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Ukrainian Ministry of Defence image of a Russian helicopter being shot down by its forces early in March.

It is effective against low-flying helicopters or aircraft at up to about 3,800m (12,400ft), making it relatively useless against higher-flying Russian bombers.

Mr Herbst said that the administration's mention of Stingers as part of the aid package to Ukraine is a ""sign of weakness"".

""They do need more Stingers, there's no doubt about that,"" he said. ""But they need higher altitude anti-aircraft weapons as well…that's a serious omission.""

What has the US not sent?

While the White House has hinted that higher-altitude weapons - such as the Soviet-era S-300 anti-aircraft missile - might be headed to Ukraine via third countries, no formal announcement has been made.

Officials in Slovakia have expressed a willingness to send the systems to Ukraine, provided they receive replacements. Two other Nato allies - Greece and Bulgaria - also reportedly have the systems.

The US has also dismissed proposals to have Poland transfer its Mig-29 fighter jets to Ukraine to allow them to do more to contest the skies.

US officials have described the plan as not ""tenable"" due to the increased risk of open conflict between Nato and Russia.

Mr Mayer, however, said that the transfer of Mig-29 or similar jets by US allies - with the administration's blessing - would be an effective way of helping Ukraine fight for control of its skies.

He noted that the Soviet Union provided both aircraft and pilots to North Vietnam to operate against US aircraft without starting a wider confrontation.

What have other countries done?

The US isn't alone in providing military aid to Ukraine. At least 30 other countries have provided help, including €500m ($551m) from the European Union, a historic first.

After the US announced the new assistance package, however, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that ""more support"" was urgently needed.

""Even more than we get now,"" he said, calling for ""air defence systems, aircraft [and] enough lethal weapons and ammunition to stop the Russian occupiers"".

Mr Mayer said he believes that the US weapon supplies pledged to date are perhaps only enough to allow the Ukrainians to ""die heroically"".

""We must be more aggressive about giving them what we have,"" he said. ""We should at least give them the same quality, and quantity, of stuff as the Soviet Union gave to North Vietnam during our war with them.""

Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Ukrainian soldiers unloading US-made Javelin anti-tank weapons just weeks before Russia's invasion on 24 February

Mr Herbst said that additional assistance packages will ""probably"" be needed in the future - and that they'll only be effective if they allow Ukraine to challenge Russia's air force.

""The key to me is whether or not we're sending something that hits Russian air assets at 30,000 feet or above,"" he said.

While no firm announcements have been made thus far, President Biden vowed that more help will be on the way - and that the US is working to help Ukraine acquire the longer-range air defence systems it needs, without providing details.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60774098

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Footage released by the Russian MOD early on Mar. 14, 2022, proves once again how sturdy the Sukhoi Su-25 Frogfoot can be. The clip shows the aircraft taxiing with significant damage reportedly caused by a MANPADS (Man Portable Air Defense System) that hit the jet on the rear right hand side of the fuselage.

Indeed, IR-homing missiles usually hit the engine nacelle/rear fuselage area where the temperature of the exhaust plume is higher and the Su-25 is not new to such events. There are plenty of photos and stories you can find online of Frogfoot aircraft that survived direct hits of 9K38 Igla, Stinger and other MANPADS during conflicts all around world. Anyway, today’s images are a reminder of both the impressive damage tolerance of the Su-25 and the threat posed to all Russian aircraft operating at medium and low altitude over the battlefields by the MANPADS operated by the Ukrainian forces.

Since the beginning of the Russian invasion, at least six Su-25s have been confirmed lost in Ukraine.

Dealing with the most recent event, the Russian MOD posted a video that shows the extent of the damage to the Su-25SM (that according to some sources was operating from an airfield in Belarus).

﻿

There’s also a brief account of the incident (that you can find roughly translated here below):

While performing a combat mission in the zone of a special military operation, the Su-25 attack aircraft, which is second in the pair, was hit by a missile from a man-portable air defense system fired from the ground by a serviceman of the armed forces of Ukraine. The pilot of the damaged aircraft, assessing the situation, decided to turn off the damaged engine and not leave the aircraft. The pilot of the leading (first) plane, Lieutenant Colonel Denis Litvinov, realizing that the comrade’s plane could not withstand a second missile hit, covered it with his own plane. The pilot of the second aircraft visually detected the launch of the second missile and, firing off flares, managed to divert the missile to the side. During the landing approach, the pilot of the damaged Su-25 reported an avionics and control systems failure, but managed to land thanks to the assitance provided by the pilot covering him. The landing was uneventful. Thanks to the cold-blooded and skillful actions of the pilot Denis Litvinov, he managed to save the life of his friend and the combat aircraft. Both pilots are presented for state awards.

The Sukhoi Su-25 Grach (Russian for “Rook”), NATO reporting name Frogfoot, is a single-seat, twin-engine jet attack aircraft developed in the Soviet Union to provide CAS (Close Air Support) for the Soviet Ground Forces. The first prototype took to the air for the first time in February 1975. They were used in the Afghan and Ossetia theatres, in the Russia – Georgia conflict, back in 2008 as well as in Syria where they were first deployed in 2015.

Considered an equivalent to the U.S. A-10 Thunderbolt II CAS aircraft, the Soviet-design is smaller but more heavily armoured than its American counterpart, with as much as 1,100 kg of titanium armor compared to the 540 kg of the A-10. Nevertheless, in both types the pilots sit in a titanium aircraft armor, referred to as a “bathtub,” which protects the cockpit from rounds fired from below.

Both were designed and built with survivability in mind: almost everything in the jets is duplicated, so as to make them as durable as possible. In the A-10, there are two tails, two hydraulic systems, two engines which are positioned on the outer side of the fuselage so as to minimize the risk of fire in case one of the two turbofan engines is hit. In fact, just like the Russian Su-25, the “Warthog” is a pretty tough plane too, that has also shown its special ability to bring the pilot back in spite of heavy damages by ground fire.

If there is one thing to describe how the Russian armed forces performed at the start of the war in Ukraine, it’s probably sloppy. Going back years ago, the U.S. managed to pull-off a smooth and quick occupation of Afghanistan. Later on, Iraq fell to the Coalition Forces, and the world witnessed precision and surgical bombings of command and controls, and an almost unhampered advance of armors to its capital.

In the case of the Russian invasion of Ukraine this 2022, things are different.

In fact, how the Russian military handled the invasion is a complete opposite, as if the anti-thesis of the precise, clean and quick operations of the Coalition Forces.

When the war broke, the world was expecting a fast collapse of Ukraine. Russia probably expected the same thing, until their planes and helicopters began falling from the sky. The intimidating armored units of Russia became prey for Ukraine’s MANPADS, with the Javelin Weapon System gaining infamy as effective tank buster. Then, there is the unexpectedly stiff Ukrainian resistance. Russia was probably caught off-guard by the tenacity of the Ukrainian forces, and the invasion never went according to plan. More than the week since it started, Russia only captured a few cities, while the massive armored convoy stalled. Observers blamed the great invasion stalls to a number of factors, with arrogant and poor planning as one of them. And as people pointed out, Russia will be facing its second Afghanistan even if they managed to take Ukraine. But as the war continue, the Javelin isn’t the only weapon system ravaging the Russian military. Ukraine also operates a small fleet of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles capable of both reconnaissance and combat. The Turkish made Bayraktar TB2.

Drones Are no Toys

Israeli IAI drone.

Modern UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) are more than just glorified radio-controlled toys one could get at the hobby stores. Flying in long periods, at great distances and guided not just by radio control isn’t something a regular model plane can do. Plus, modern UAVs could accomplish what science fiction have been warning us. To kill.

Sending an unmanned airborne vehicle wasn’t a new idea. Way before the birth of heavier than aircraft, the Austrians tried to use pilotless balloons to blow Venice in July 1849. These killer balloons were launched from the ground, or from a ship, much like the modern UAV. Yet being balloons with no steering mechanisms, the plan failed miserably when the wind blew them off course. Yet that doesn’t stop the world powers from developing their unmanned flying vehicles, and in the Second World War, the Germans unleashed perhaps the first robot vehicle that could kill. The V-1 flying bomb. Development continued after the war, with drones being used for training practices and surveillance. And it was the Israeli who demonstrated the effective use of modern drones, when it uses the IAI scouts to help neutralize the Syrian air defense. Nevertheless, watching the enemy was the primary use of the drones back then. But drones started to carry weapons.

Targeted Killings

A Predator UAV.

Like many of the UAVs, the MQ-1 Predator was made for long endurance reconnaissance missions. Later on, it began to carry designators for laser guided bombs from manned aircrafts, further expanding its role. And that same laser designator is used for AGM-114 Hellfire. Eventually, an armed version of the Predator came out, this time armed with the said missile under its wings.

And since the introduction of the Buzz Bombs, UAVs have the capabilities to kill.

The armed UAV was involved in various conflicts, but it became infamous for targeted killings. A robot sent to assassinate an individual is the stuff of action movies, but that’s exactly what happened. The Predator, and other UAV versions hunted and killed Al Qaeda leaders. Drones have advantages like being silent, hence they could approach undetected before unloading their missiles. And one of its victims is Abu Khayr al-Masri, and Egyptian Al Qaeda leader.

And fast forward to the Russian Invasion of Ukraine, another UAV is adding to the woes of the already stalled Russian armors.





The Turkish Bayraktar TB2

The Bayraktar TB2.

When dealing with a massive Russian convoy, the Ukrainians resorted to various anti-tank weapons. The Javelins and NLAWs are part of the arsenal, and up in the air, a Turkish-made armed drone delivers its load of laser guided missiles.

The Bayraktar TB2, which means “flag bearer” in Turkish is a medium altitude, high endurance UAV. It could be remotely controlled or flown autonomously, with monitoring by the ground crew. The Turkish military is the main operator, but other countries also owned a fleet. On the outside, it uses a blended wing and body design and an inversed V tail. The internal combustion engine (105 horse-power) that powers the drone sits between the tail boom. The drone is controlled by three operators (pilot, payload operator and mission commander) in a NATO based shelter, equipped with cross redundant command and control system. The drone could fly at 80 mph, and armed with four laser guided missiles. Being a long flyer, it could loiter at 24 hours, at the height of 25000 feet. Overall, it’s lighter compared to the MQ-9 Reaper. And with its low purchasing (less than 10 million dollars) and maintenance cost, the said drone is the Kalashnikov rifle of the UAV world.

Lake many of its contemporaries, the drone saw actions in conflicts, like counterterrorism and Syrian Civil War. And recently, Ukraine used it in great effects against Russian armors.

The Damages

Destroyed Russian tanks.

Ukraine owned 20 of these drones, and still ordering more. And before the Russian Invasion of Ukraine, drones were never used against a major military power. The deployment of the Bayraktar TB2 marked the first time UAVs are used to fight such a powerful opponent. As the war in Ukraine continues, Russia’s poor planning was greatly exploited through the drone’s deployment.

The problem is that Russia failed to secure air superiority over Ukraine. The air defense established by the Russians is equally sloppy. Though it was believed that Russia owned a large number of S-400, the drone somehow managed to elude their air defenses. Possibly, Russia never had enough defenses to protect its convoy. And with minimal threats in the air, the Bayraktar TB2 is free operate. Armed with the UAV, Ukraine managed to carry-out dozens of successful missions. The result is blown vehicles and casualties in the Russian side. The drone also played a role in the stall of the Russian armored convoy, after it destroyed a fuel train.

Ukraine’s success in repelling Russia’s initial plan for a lightning advance and capture of Kyiv and other major cities owes much to its army’s consistent ability to target and destroy vehicles, inflicting both heavy losses and large delays to advancing convoys.

Often armed only with shoulder-launched, portable rocket launchers — thousands of which have been provided by western countries since the invasion began — small groups of Ukrainian troops have used their terrain and Russia’s tactics to their advantage, and helped lead a resistance that has surprised even Kyiv’s closest backers in the west.

The compact weapons used by Ukraine and the heavy artillery relied upon by Russian troops form the backbone of the contrasting tactics employed by both sides.

Russia’s battalion tactical groups

One of the main outcomes of a root-and-branch overhaul of the Russian armed forces that culminated in 2012, the battalion tactical group is the primary fighting unit of the country’s army. The US estimates that 100 of Russia’s roughly 170 BTGs — designed to be both quickly adaptable and possess high levels of firepower — have been deployed in Ukraine.

Armed with tanks, howitzers, artillery and air defence systems, they were envisaged as multi-theatre operators, with the ability to shift from rapid assault to long-range attacks and support operations for other units.

But their heavy reliance on vehicles — roughly 75 in each — and relatively low numbers of just 200 infantry troops makes them particularly vulnerable to attacks on their flanks or rear. That is especially true in a war where the terrain, the tactics and the level of Ukrainian military capabilities mean the BTGs are not fighting against similarly deployed and armed units.

Russian vulnerabilities

Planned by Russian president Vladimir Putin among a tiny group of advisers, the invasion of Ukraine was a shock to many of the Russian troops deployed on the country’s border for “exercises”.

That meant the vehicles abruptly ordered to cross the border were in a poor state of maintenance and often with low quality tyres or spare parts, according to western intelligence officials and defence analysts. That made off-road manoeuvrability risky or impossible, as the large number of photos of Russian equipment abandoned in mud-clogged fields or with ruptured tyres or axles attest.

In addition, Vladimir Putin’s plan called for a rapid attack and capture of key cities like Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol. That meant moving quickly down major roads and fighting for control of major junctions, rather than provincial towns or countryside areas.

Ukrainian troops drew two conclusions. First, they realised that no matter how large an armoured column was, it would only be as wide as the road, and could only move as fast as the front vehicles. And second, defending troops realised they could operate relatively freely in the forests, fields and villages along the sides of the road.

With little Russian infantry cover on their flanks, Russian vehicles proved vulnerable to ambushes from small teams of Ukrainian troops, picking off targets from cover that could then hide their retreat.

Javelins

Key to these ambushes has been the widespread use of troop-carried, shoulder-fired anti-tank missiles, such as the US-made Javelin.

They were sent to Ukraine before the invasion began to allow troops to be taught by western military instructors how best to use them, and are now arriving in their thousands from countries all across the Nato alliance. Ukrainian and western officials have said those supplies are a critical backbone of resistance to the invasion.

Its compact size makes it easily transportable by fast-moving infantry, while the missile’s tracking system means it can be fired-and-forgotten, allowing troops to quickly leave the location of attack before the projectile has even struck its target. A double warhead also allows it to inflict serious damage on reinforced Russian tanks.

Other videos have shown troops using rocket-propelled grenades — lighter but less powerful and harder to aim — or one-man next generation light anti-tank weapons to achieve the same outcome.

Air war

Western intelligence officials broadly agree that one of Russia’s most costly military mistakes stemmed from its failure to destroy both Ukraine’s air force and its air defence systems in its initial barrage of precision-guided cruise missiles in the opening hours of the invasion.

That failure meant Russia did not gain air supremacy in the skies above the battlefield, a position it has used to devastating effect in Syria, for example.

In addition, the use of shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles by Ukrainian troops to successfully attack Russian helicopters and low-flying fighter jets in support of ground forces has deepened Moscow’s reticence over deploying too much air power alongside advances. That has reduced both its surveillance and attack potential.

Russia has lost at least 28 aircraft and helicopters so far in the invasion compared to just 10 from Ukraine’s air force, according to the Oryx blog, which uses open source photography to compile its data.",https://www.ft.com/content/f5fb2996-f816-4011-a440-30350fa48831

March 13 (Reuters) - Russia has asked China for military equipment since its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, the Financial Times and Washington Post reported on Sunday, citing U.S. officials.

U.S. National Security advisor Jake Sullivan will be in Rome on Monday to meet with China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi, the White House said earlier.

Russia, which calls its action in Ukraine a ""special operation,"" and China have tightened cooperation as they have come under strong Western pressure over human rights and a raft of other issues.

Beijing has not condemned Russia's attack and does not call it an invasion, but has urged a negotiated solution.

The White House's National Security Council declined to comment.

The Washington Post said the unidentified U.S. officials did not state the kind of weaponry that had been requested or how China had responded.

Summary

The UN says at least 596 civilians have died since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including 43 children. A further 1067 have been injured.

Three UN agencies are calling for an immediate end to attacks on health care facilities.

The fourth round of talks between Russia and Ukraine is due to start at 9.30pm New Zealand time.

Multiple media outlets are reporting Russia is asking China for military and economic help.

Russia has effectively cut Ukraine off from maritime trade after establishing a distant blockade of the Black Sea coast, the UK says.

8.45pm: That concludes live updates from day 19 of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Breakfast will have the latest developments from Ukraine from 6am on TVNZ1 and OnDemand.

8.35pm: Australia and the Netherlands taking legal action against Russia over the downing of MH17 through the International Civil Aviation Organization.

MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine in 2014. It killed all 298 people onboard, including 38 Australians.

From the AAP:

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison says the legal action was a major step forward in truth and accountability for a ""horrific"" act of violence.

""The Russian Federation's refusal to take responsibility for its role in the downing of Flight MH17 is unacceptable and the Australian government has always said that it will not exclude any legal options in our pursuit of justice,"" Morrison says in a joint statement.

Australia and the Netherlands will rely on ""overwhelming"" evidence that the flight was brought down by a Russian missile in eastern Ukraine, an area that was under the control of Russian-backed separatists.

ADVERTISEMENT

The missile belonged to Russia's 53rd anti-aircraft military brigade, and was accompanied by a trained Russian military crew.

Both countries said the evidence showed the missile could only have been fired by the trained Russian crew, with the missile system later returned to Russia shortly after the incident.

Russia withdrew from negotiations with Australia and the Netherlands in October 2020 about MH17.

Russia did not return to the negotiating table, despite repeated requests from Australia and the Netherlands.

8.30pm: From the Associated Press:

Russian forces fired artillery strikes on suburbs northwest of Kyiv overnight and targeted points east of the capital, the head of the Kyiv region says.

A town councillor for Brovary east of Kyiv was killed in fighting there, regional administration chief Oleksiy Kuleba says on Ukrainian television.

ADVERTISEMENT

He also reports strikes overnight on the northwest towns of Irpin, Bucha and Hostomel, which have seen some of the worst fighting in Russia’s stalled attempt to take the capital.

The general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces say that Russian troops have not made major advances over the past 24 hours, despite expanding strikes to the west.

Ukrainian forces are targeting Russian bases, targeting their logistical abilities, the general staff say in a statement on Facebook.

The general staff accused Russian forces of setting up firing positions and military equipment in churches and other civilian infrastructure so that Ukrainian forces can’t fire back. The accusation could not be immediately verified, though Associated Press reporters have seen Russian armoured vehicles in residential areas.

8.25pm: The fourth round of talks between Russia and Ukraine is due to start in just over an hour, at 9.30pm New Zealand time.

Earlier, Zelensky adviser Mykhailo Podoliak says Russia ""is starting to talk constructively"" and seems more ""sensitive to Ukraine's position"".

Russia previously said it would not back down on its so-called military operation unless Ukraine did the following:

8.12pm: The BBC reports that, according to Ukrainian authorities, Antonov Airport in northern Kyiv has been hit by Russian shelling.

7.48pm: The UK's Ministry of Defence says 2.5 million people have been forced from their homes because of the invasion.

7.25pm: Pregnant woman, baby die after Russia bombed maternity ward

ADVERTISEMENT

From the Associated Press:

A pregnant woman and her baby have died after Russia bombed the maternity hospital where she was meant to give birth, The Associated Press has learned.

Images of the woman being rushed to an ambulance on a stretcher had circled the world, epitomising the horror of an attack on humanity’s most innocent.

In video and photos shot on Thursday by AP journalists after the attack on the hospital, the woman was seen stroking her bloodied lower abdomen as rescuers rushed her through the rubble in the besieged city of Mariupol, her blanched face mirroring her shock at what had just happened. It was among the most brutal moments so far in Russia’s now 19-day-old war on Ukraine.

The woman was rushed to another hospital, yet closer to the frontline, where doctors laboured to keep her alive. Realising she was losing her baby, medics say she cried out to them: “Kill me now!”

Surgeon Timur Marin found the woman’s pelvis crushed and hip detached.

ADVERTISEMENT

Medics delivered the baby via cesarean section, but it showed “no signs of life,” the surgeon says.

Then, they focused on the mother.

“More than 30 minutes of resuscitation of the mother didn’t produce results,” Marin says.

“Both died.”

Accused of war crimes, Russian officials claim the maternity hospital had been taken over by Ukrainian extremists to use as a base, and that no patients or medics were left inside.

Russia’s ambassador to the UN and the Russian Embassy in London calls the images “fake news"".

Associated Press journalists, who have been reporting from inside blockaded Mariupol since early in the war, documented the attack and saw the victims and damage firsthand. They shot video and photos of several bloodstained, pregnant mothers fleeing the blown-out maternity ward, medics shouting, children crying.

7.08pm: An apartment block in Kyiv is on fire after shelling, according to videos and images from Ukraine's State Emergency Service.

According to authorities, two people were found dead and three were hospitalised.

6.56pm: The latest developments from the US from 1News correspondent Anna Burns Francis:

6.26pm: CNN reports that the World Health Organization is worried that fighting in Ukraine could make the Covid-19 pandemic worse.

ADVERTISEMENT

WHO says it is trying to limit the spread of the virus, but that there is a risk that it could be passed around the more than 2 million people who have fled Ukraine.

There is also concern that Ukraine and its neighbouring countries have low vaccination rates, meaning they may experience the virus more severely.

However, the executive director of WHO's health emergencies programme Dr Mike Ryan is warning against stereotypes of refugees and disease.

""Let us be very careful with our rhetoric because this always arises that in some way people fleeing the horrors of war are going to bring stuff with them. Europe has plenty of Covid as it stands, and it has got to deal with that, and Ukrainian refugees are not going to change the dial on that,"" he says.

Our World in Data statistics show 35 per cent of its population is fully vaccinated against Covid-19. Of its westward neighbours, where many refugees are heading to, Moldova has the lowest vaccination rate of 29 per cent, while Hungary has the highest at 66 per cent.

5.45pm: Mobil reduces fuel prices after New Zealand Government's announcement

ADVERTISEMENT

Following the Government's Monday afternoon announcement that it will be slashing excise duty on fuel by 25 cents per litre from 11.59pm for the next three months, Mobil says it is immediately reducing its prices across all its petrol grades by the same amount immediately.

Mobil lead country manager Andrew McNaught says the fuel company wants to do its part in helping reduce the rising cost of living.

“International fuel prices have kept rising as a result of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the sanctions imposed on Russia, [the] third-largest oil producer in the world.”

“Our product costs have risen significantly from the middle of December, and continue to rise. These costs on average have more than doubled since the beginning of December, and have increased more than 50 per cent in the last two weeks,"" McNaught says.

Meanwhile, the Government is warning petrol companies not to pocket the profits from the reduction of excise tax.

5.19pm: From the Associated Press:

More than two weeks into a war he expected to dominate in two days, Putin is projecting anger, frustration at his military’s failures, and a willingness to cause even more violence and destruction in Ukraine, in the assessment of US intelligence officials.

US officials in recent days have publicly said they're worried the Russian president will escalate the conflict to try to break Ukraine's resistance.

Russia still holds overwhelming military advantages and can bombard the country for weeks more.

And while the rest of the world reacts to horrific images of the war he started, Putin remains insulated from domestic pressure by what CIA Director William Burns calls a “propaganda bubble"".

Putin's mindset — as tough as it is to determine from afar — is critical for the West to understand as it provides more military aid to Ukraine and also prevents Putin from directly taking on NATO countries or possibly reaching for the nuclear button.

Intelligence officials over two days of testimony before Congress last week openly voiced concerns about what Putin might do. And those concerns increasingly shape discussions about what US policymakers are willing to do for Ukraine.

Burns is a former US ambassador to Moscow who has met with Putin many times. He told lawmakers, in response to a question about the Russian president's mental state, that he did not believe Putin was crazy.

ADVERTISEMENT

“I think Putin is angry and frustrated right now,” he said last week. “He’s likely to double down and try to grind down the Ukrainian military with no regard for civilian casualties.”

4.48pm: National leader Christopher Luxon has responded to the Government's announcement:

“Excise tweaks don’t fix wider cost of living crisis” - Luxon @1NewsNZ — Jessica Mutch McKay TVNZ (@MutchJessica) March 14, 2022

Meanwhile, the Greens say direct payments would have been better:

“The Green Party says direct payments to New Zealanders would have provided better support than a temporary cut in fuel tax.” - Greens @1NewsNZ — Jessica Mutch McKay TVNZ (@MutchJessica) March 14, 2022

4.36pm: Finance Minister Grant Robertson says he will be topping up the national land transport fund to compensate for the expected loss of revenue following the drop in excise tax.

Robertson says the amount of revenue the Ministry of Transport estimates that will be lost because of the reduction is $350 million for the three-month period.

Some money to fill that gap will be from the Covid response fund, especially considering the reduction in MIQ costs, he says.

4.15pm: NZ Government tries to ease Kiwis' pain at the pump

New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is announcing a number of changes to help Kiwis struggling with gas prices at the pump amid Russia's invasion.

For the next three months, the Government will reduce both the road user charges (RUC) and the excise duty on fuel by 25 cents per litre.

The latter would save motorists about $11.25 to $17.25 each time they filled their tank, compared to current prices, Ardern says.

ADVERTISEMENT

The drop in excise will come into effect from 11.59pm on Monday. However, the Government indicates there are some legislative and logistical restrictions that delayed the immediate reductions in RUC.

Ardern says the Government will also subsidise public transport by 50 per cent and expand public transport links. This will kick in on April 1 until the end of June.

She says New Zealand can't control the war, but it could take steps to help ease the burden of the ""wicked, perfect storm"".

She also says what's happening around the world is also a signal for New Zealand to continue its transition away from fossil fuels.

3.50pm: Australia is announcing fresh sanctions to target people connected to Moscow. Among those included in the sanctions is Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich and the CEO of energy corporation Gazprom Alexey Miller.

From the AAP:

ADVERTISEMENT

Abramovich was one of seven wealthy Russians targeted by the UK government in a further round of sanctions last week, which involved asset freezes, travel bans and an embargo on transactions with UK individuals and businesses.

Australia's latest round of sanctions also includes more than 30 Russian oligarchs, prominent business people and immediate family members.

""The sanctions reinforce Australia's commitment to sanction those people who have amassed vast personal wealth and are of economic and strategic significance to Russia,"" Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne says.

""Many of these oligarchs have facilitated, or directly benefited, from the Kremlin's illegal and indefensible actions in Ukraine since 2014.""

Ukraine's top diplomat in Australia accused Russia of instigating genocide as tanks deliberately target residential buildings.

Charge d'Affaires Volodymyr Shalkivskyi says fleeing through humanitarian corridors being offered by Russia has become risky because troops do not always honour the safe passage.

""We would like everyone who is on our side to send a strong message to Moscow that this kind of atrocity in the 21st century is not possible and Russia will pay the price,"" he tells Adelaide radio station 5AA.

ADVERTISEMENT

""We are determined to defend our country. There are no indications so far we can find compromise regarding peaceful resolution.""

Thousands of troops and civilians have been killed by Russian forces, including 85 children ranging from three months to 16 years old, the envoy says.

""This is genocide because hitting residential areas is a clear sign of genocide. Russia means to take out Ukrainian ethnicity from the map,"" Shalkivskyi says.

""They would like to integrate Ukrainians into Russia without allowing us to have our culture, our language and our history.""

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has spoken to his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte about Russian sanctions, military and humanitarian support for Ukraine as well as implications for the Indo-Pacific region.

Morrison also says the two countries will continue to pursue accountability for MH17, which was shot down over eastern Ukraine in 2014.

On March 2, Russia's Ministry of Defence said that 498 of its troops had been killed in Ukraine and 1597 more were wounded. Russia's military hasn't provided updated figures since.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says it is a “black day” after Russia shelled a military base in the western part of his country.

Zelensky says in his daily address that Russia fired 30 rockets at the Yavoriv military base. He says the attack killed 35 people and injured 134 injured others.

The base is less than 25 kilometres from the Polish border. Zelensky says he has given Western leaders “clear warning” of the danger to the base. He asks NATO leaders again to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine. He warns “it is only a matter of time” before Russian missals fall on NATO territory.

A military drone that apparently flew all the way from the Ukrainian war zone over three European NATO-member states before crashing in an urban zone of the Croatian capital was armed with an explosive device, Croatia’s defense minister said on Sunday local time.

The Soviet-made aircraft crossed Romania and Hungary before entering Croatia, slamming into a field near a student dormitory late Thursday. About 40 parked cars were damaged in the large explosion, but no one was injured.

6.20am: The first foreign journalist has died in the crossfire of the conflict. American journalist Brent Renaud was shot dead as he filmed refugees fleeing Irpin. Two other journalists were also shot and taken to hospital. A statement from Kyiv regional police said that Russian troops opened fire on a car, and that one journalist died.

Waves of Russian missiles pounded a military training base in western Ukraine on Sunday, killing 35 people in an attack on a facility that has served as a crucial hub for cooperation between Ukraine and the NATO countries supporting it in its defense against Moscow's grinding assault.

More than 30 Russian cruise missiles targeted the sprawling facility, which lies not far from the border with NATO member Poland and that has long been used to train Ukrainian military personnel, often with instructors from the U.S. and other countries in the western alliance.

5.55am: From the Associated Press

Three UN agencies are calling for an immediate end to attacks on health care facilities in Ukraine, calling them “an act of unconscionable cruelty.”

In a joint statement Sunday, the UN Children’s Fund, the World Health Organization and the UN Population Fund said that “horrific attacks are killing and causing serious injuries to patients and health workers, destroying vital health infrastructure and forcing thousands to forgo accessing health services despite catastrophic needs.”

“To attack the most vulnerable — babies, children, pregnant women, and those already suffering from illness and disease, and health workers risking their own lives to save lives — is an act of unconscionable cruelty,” they said.

Since the start of the war at least 12 people were killed and 34 were injured, while 24 facilities and five ambulances were damaged or destroyed, the agencies said.

They said that some 4300 children have been born since the conflict began and 80,000 Ukrainian women are expected to give birth in the next three months, with oxygen and other medical supplies running dangerously low.

“The health care system in Ukraine is clearly under significant strain, and its collapse would be a catastrophe. Every effort must be made to prevent this from happening,” they said.",https://www.1news.co.nz/2022/03/14/fourth-round-of-ukraine-russia-talks-imminent/

Publicité Lire la suite

Le site se nomme 1920.in et tire son nom d'une unité de pilotes polonais de la Seconde Guerre mondiale qui avait rejoint la Royal Air Force britannique pour poursuivre le combat contre Hitler après l'annexion de la Pologne. Le site a été créé par une équipe de développeurs polonais, se faisant appeler « la Squad303 » qui affirme avoir piraté plus de 20 millions de numéros mobiles de personnes et d’entreprises domiciliées en Russie, ainsi que 140 millions d’adresses de courriels appartenant à des citoyens et citoyennes, dans le pays.

We are 7 days old! 🎂 You sent 7,000,000 (Yes! Seven millions!) Text messages to randomly selected Russians via https://t.co/yI1zLytWYP ! Even in our dreams we didn't dream of such a result! Thank you people of the free world! We love you!♥️ #FightForUkraine ✌️🇺🇦 @YourAnonNews pic.twitter.com/xIosMhpstK — squad303 (@squad3o3) March 11, 2022

Concrètement, l’internaute accède à l’un de ces numéros qui sera affiché de façon aléatoire sur le site. Il lui suffit alors de recopier un texte pré-rédigé en russe pour l'envoyer depuis WhatsApp ou à partir de n’importe quel application SMS depuis un ordinateur, un mobile ou en passant directement par le site. Si, depuis ce lundi matin, Google a bloqué la traduction automatique de texte en russe pour limiter les actions de propagande en ligne du Kremlin sur son navigateur, vous pouvez toujours vérifier la teneur du message à l’aide de différents outils numériques. Notamment la nouvelle version du traducteur en ligne DeepL, qui s’utilise aussi facilement que celui du géant du web américain. Voici le contenu du message en français que vous proposent d’envoyer les Squad303 : « Chers Russes, vos médias sont censurés. Le Kremlin ment. Découvrez la vérité sur l'Ukraine sur l'internet gratuit et sur l'application Telegram. Il est temps de renverser le dictateur Poutine ! »

Depuis le lancement du service, Squad303 revendique plus de 7 millions de SMS qui ont été envoyés par son intermédiaire – et zéro selon les autorités de surveillance des télécoms russes ! Évidemment, le nombre exact des participants qui lancent ces missives du monde entier et surtout celui des personnes qui ont reçu ce type de message est, de toute façon, invérifiable.

This is crazy. The person questioned me being American so I had to prove it. I’ve sent over 200 messages thanks to @squad3o3 to Russian cell phones. This one got me, it roughly translates to “it’s terrible in Russia” @xxNB65 @YourAnonNews @xenasolo @ZelenskyyUa got a new friend🙏 pic.twitter.com/UOunxs2aIJ — Mr. T aka Masta Chef/CireX14 (@titancrawford1) March 6, 2022

Certains experts en cybersécurité estiment cependant que l’envoi de ces SMS exposerait leurs destinataires à des mesures répressives dans leur pays en vertu de la nouvelle loi russe qui sanctionne de quinze ans de prison toute « fausse information » sur la guerre en Ukraine. Notamment lors des contrôles intempestifs effectués par les forces de police russes sur les mobiles des citoyens avec l’affichage de ces textos susceptibles de les envoyer directement en prison.

Le groupe polonais Squad303, qui revendique soutenir les opérations de piratage des Anonymous, n’en est pas à son coup d’essai en annonçant, ce samedi, l'intrusion et le vol des données sur les serveurs informatiques du ministère du Développement économique de la Russie.

Une opération, semble-t-il, réussie, puisque les informations dérobées sont dorénavant affichées et publiées en ligne. La réaction des hackers russes a été immédiate. NetBlocks, le groupe de surveillance des réseaux internet et mobiles dans le monde, signalait ce dimanche que l’opérateur Vinasterisk, qui couvre l'ouest de l'Ukraine, a connu une panne massive. Le résultat d’une cyberattaque de grande envergure qui comprenait aussi des éléments de sabotage et de vol de données.

43,fdc0bda1-b744-4809-aa4b-c7abc85253dc,[],,"مع استمرار الهجوم العسكري الروسي على أوكرانيا، تتصاعد الحرب الإلكترونية المتعلقة بهذا الصراع مع دخول متطوعين رقميين من جميع أنحاء العالم في المعركة الافتراضية المفتوحة.

ووفقًا لفرع الأبحاث في شركة ""تشيك بوينت سوفتوير تكنولوجيز""، فإن عدد الهجمات الإلكترونية التي يشنها كلا البلدين بشكل مباشر أو بالوكالة منذ اندلاع الحرب؛ ""مذهل"".

وقال لوتيم فينكلستين، رئيس استخبارات التهديدات في الشركة: ""لأول مرة في التاريخ يمكن لأي شخص الانضمام إلى حرب"". وأضاف: ""نحن نرى المجتمع الإلكتروني بأكمله متورطًا، حيث اتخذ العديد من المجموعات والأفراد جانبًا، إمّا مع روسيا أو مع أوكرانيا"". وقال: ""هناك الكثير من الفوضى السيبرانية"".

انتفاضة إلكترونية

وفي الأيام الثلاثة الأولى التي أعقبت الهجوم على أوكرانيا، زادت الهجمات الإلكترونية ضد القطاعات العسكرية والحكومية الأوكرانية بنسبة 196%، وفقًا للشركة. كما أنها زادت بشكل متواضع مقابل المنظمات الروسية (4%) والأوكرانية (0.2%)، بينما انخفضت في الوقت نفسه في معظم أنحاء العالم الأخرى، وفقًا لبيانات الشركة، التي عرضتها شبكة ""سي أن بي سي نيوز"".

ومنذ ذلك الحين، تقدر السلطات الأوكرانية أن حوالي 400 ألف متسلل متعدد الجنسيات تطوعوا لمساعدة أوكرانيا، كما قال يوفال وولمان، رئيس شركة الأمن السيبراني ""سيبير بروف"" والمدير العام السابق لوزارة المخابرات الإسرائيلية.

وقال: ""تسبب المتطوعون على مستوى القاعدة الشعبية في اضطراب واسع النطاق - كتبوا على الجدران رسائل مناهضة للحرب على وسائل الإعلام الروسية وتسريب البيانات من عمليات القرصنة المتنافسة"". وأضاف: ""لم نشهد أبدًا هذا المستوى من المشاركة من قبل جهات خارجية لا علاقة لها بالنزاع"".

وبعد ثلاثة أسابيع، تستمر أوكرانيا في تحمل وابل من الهجمات عبر الإنترنت، يستهدف معظمها حكومتها وجيشها، وفقًا لبيانات في ""تشيك بوينت سوفتوير تكنولوجيز"".

ونفت موسكو باستمرار أنها تشارك في حرب إلكترونية أو تدعمها. وفي 19 فبراير/ شباط، قالت السفارة الروسية في واشنطن عبر تويتر: ""إنها لم تقم مطلقًا ولا تقوم بأي عمليات خبيثة في الفضاء الإلكتروني"".

⚠️ Confirmed: Major internet disruption registered on the Vinasterisk network which serves #Vinnytsia Oblast, western #Ukraine; the operator reports a massive cyberattack with elements of sabotage 📉 📰 Background: https://t.co/S0qJQ7CbNv pic.twitter.com/Zq9ZQdZZDn — NetBlocks (@netblocks) March 13, 2022

وقال فينكلشتاين: ""إن بيانات الشركة تظهر أن الهجمات على روسيا انخفضت خلال الإطار الزمني نفسه"". وقال: ""إنه قد تكون هناك عدة أسباب لذلك، من بينها الجهود الروسية للحد من ظهور الهجمات أو زيادة الأمن للدفاع ضدها"".

جيش أوكرانيا التقني

وكهدف قديم للهجمات الإلكترونية الروسية المشتبه بها، ترحب أوكرانيا على ما يبدو بالمساعدة الرقمية.

وبناءً على طلب نشره الوزير الرقمي الأوكراني ميخايلو فيدوروف عبر تويتر، انضم حوالي 308000 شخص إلى مجموعة ""تليغرام"" المعروفة باسم ""جيش تكنولوجيا المعلومات في أوكرانيا"".

وقال أحد أعضاء المجموعة، جينادي غالانتر، المؤسس المشارك لشركة تكنولوجيا المعلومات ""بروفيكتوس"": ""إن المجموعة تركز على تعطيل المواقع الروسية ومنع التضليل وإيصال معلومات دقيقة إلى المواطنين الروس"". وأضاف غالانتر: ""إن لديه مشاعر مختلطة بشأن المشاركة"".

وأحد الأساليب التي تستخدمها المجموعة هو توزيع هجمات رفض الخدمة، والتي تحاول جعل المواقع المستهدفة غير قابلة للوصول من خلال إغراقها بحركة المرور عبر الإنترنت.

اعتبرها غالانتر، الذي فرّ من الاتحاد السوفييتي عام 1991 وزوجته روسية، ""أعمال شغب""، ولكن في الوقت نفسه، أفاد بأنه يشعر بأنه مضطر للمساعدة في القيام بدوره في ""إيصال الحقيقة وإنكار الأكاذيب"".

ويتخوف غالانتر من أن تكون الجهود الحالية غير كافية بمواجهة القدرات الإلكترونية الروسية، ومن احتمال رفض جهود المجموعة باعتبارها دعاية أوكرانية أو غربية أو وصفها بأنها آلة تضليل من النوع الذي يزعم أنه يقاتل ضده.

انتقام موسكو

وبحسب ""سي أن بي سي نيوز""، فمن المتوقع على نطاق واسع أن موسكو وأنصارها سوف ينتقمون من البلدان التي تقف إلى جانب أوكرانيا، وربما من القائمة المتزايدة للبنوك والشركات التي تنسحب من البلاد.

ويحذر الخبراء من أن الرد المتبادل قد يؤدي إلى ""حرب إلكترونية عالمية"" بين روسيا والغرب.

ويُعتقد أن روسيا كانت وراء العديد من الهجمات الرقمية ضد أوكرانيا في الأسابيع التي سبقت الهجوم، ولكن منذ ذلك الحين أظهرت روسيا ضبط النفس، ""على الأقل في الوقت الحالي""، وفقًا لما ذكره وولمان، رئيس شركة الأمن السيبراني ""سيبير بروف"".

ومع ذلك، فإن التقارير التي تتحدث عن الغضب المتزايد داخل الكرملين بشأن العقوبات الجديدة، والتي تفاقمت بفعل الإخفاقات العسكرية الروسية في أوكرانيا؛ قد تجعل الحرب الإلكترونية واحدة من ""الأدوات"" القليلة المتبقية في كتاب قواعد اللعبة الذي وضعه بوتين، على حد قوله.

ويعتقد أن الرد السيبراني سيكون الإجراء الروسي المضاد الأكثر ترجيحًا.

عمليات تجسس ضد أوكرانيا

وكشفت ""غوغل"" المملوكة لشركة ""ألفابت"" الأسبوع الماضي، أن قراصنة إنترنت روسًا معروفين لدى خبراء أمن الإنترنت منخرطون في عمليات تجسس، يشنون هجمات إلكترونية على أهداف أوكرانية وأخرى تابعة لحلفاء أوروبيين لأوكرانيا.

وقالت مجموعة تحليل التهديدات التابعة لشركة ""غوغل""، والتي تركز على التصدي لعمليات القرصنة الإلكترونية وتحذر المستخدمين بشأنها، الإثنين الفائت: إنّ ""وحدة التسلل الروسية ""فانسي بير"" والمعروفة أيضًا باسم ""إيه.بي.تي28"" ترسل رسائل بريد إلكتروني زائفة لشركة أوكرنت الإعلامية الأوكرانية"".

وحسب ""غوغل"" فإن الهدف من إرسال رسائل بريد إلكتروني زائفة هو سرقة بيانات دخول المستخدمين كي يستطيع القراصنة استهداف أجهزة كمبيوتر وحسابات على الإنترنت.

صراعات أخرى

ويمكن للحرب الأوكرانية الروسية أن تؤجج نزاعات إقليمية أخرى طويلة الأمد. فقد أعلنت شركتان تكنولوجيتان تايوانيتان ناشئتان هما ""أوتوبوليتيك"" و ""كيو سيرتش""، الأسبوع الماضي عن تقديم مساعدة تقنية مجانية لأوكرانيا و""النشطاء الأوكرانيين على الإنترنت في جميع أنحاء العالم"" لمواجهة الدعاية الروسية على وسائل التواصل الاجتماعي.

وقال روجر دو، مؤسس ""أوتو بوليتيك""، عبر بيان صحفي: ""لكوني تايوانيًا عاش في ظل دعاية مستمرة وتهديدات بالهجوم من جيراننا القريبين، أشعر بعلاقة خاصة مع الأوكرانيين وغضب تجاه غزاتهم"".",https://www.alaraby.com/news/%D9%81%D9%88%D8%B6%D9%89-%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%B7%D9%88%D8%B9%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%AE%D8%B1%D8%B7%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A8-%D8%A5%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D9%88%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%83%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7

Siły rosyjskie użyły w Popasnej w obwodzie ługańskim na Ukrainie zabronionych pocisków fosforowych .

. Prezydent Andrzej Duda w rozmowie z BBC nie wykluczył, że Władimir Putin może zdecydować o wykorzystaniu broni chemicznej.

Doradca prezydenta USA ds. bezpieczeństwa narodowego Jake Sullivan oświadczył, że nalot sił rosyjskich ""w pobliżu polskiej granicy dowodzi, że prezydent Putin rozszerza kierunki ataków"".

Uderzenia rakietowo-powietrzne sił rosyjskich dotknęły większość miast w rejonach walk - informują eksperci OSW.

ONZ: Niemal 2,7 mln osób wyjechało z objętej wojną Ukrainy. Z tego ponad 1,72 mln uchodźców wjechało do Polski.

Nie ma bezpośredniego zagrożenia dla Kijowa, rosyjskie wojska pod miastem zostały rozbite - powiedział doradca prezydenta Zełenskiego.

WAR BULLETIN

March 15, 10.00 EST

Russian troops continue to use civilian infrastructure for firing positions, deploy weapons and military equipment. They shelled residential buildings and infrastructure in Kyiv. As a result of the rocket attacks, two high-rise buildings in Podilsky and Svyatoshinsky districts were damaged.

There is a high probability of provocations aimed at involving the Belarusian side into the war against Ukraine.

As of the morning of March 15, 2022, 97 children were killed and more than 100 wounded. 400 educational institutions were damaged, 59 of them were completely destroyed. At least 28 buildings of spiritual significance have been damaged.

WAR ROOM

General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine

The total combat losses of the enemy from 24.02 to 15.03 were approximately:

personnel - more 13500,

tanks ‒ 404,

APV ‒ 1279,

artillery systems – 150,

MLRS - 64,

anti-aircraft warfare systems - 36,

aircraft – 81,

helicopters – 95,

vehicles - 640,

vessels - 3,

fuel tanks - 60,

UAV operational-tactical level - 9.

Data are being updated. The calculation is complicated by the high intensity of hostilities.

The twentieth day of the heroic resistance of the Ukrainian people to the Russian military invasion began. Status, position and nature of actions of the defense forces without significant changes.

The Armed Forces of Ukraine are inflicting devastating blows on groups of troops and the rear infrastructure of the occupiers. During the past 24hrs, four helicopters, one plane and a fighter shot down an enemy cruise missile were hit by a group of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

The groups of the occupying forces involved in the offensive did not have significant success in all areas of advance. The main efforts continue to be focused on maintaining the occupied borders.

The enemy continues to launch missile and bomb attacks on critical infrastructure. Uses a network of health care facilities in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine to treat wounded personnel.

Also, the invaders continue to insidiously use civilian infrastructure to equip firing positions, deploy weapons and military equipment.

According to the available information, due to the inability to maintain the functioning of institutions and organizations to ensure the livelihood of settlements in the temporarily occupied territories of ORDLO (certain areas of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts), the occupiers are forced to suspend the mobilization of communal workers.

The moral and psychological state of the enemy remains low, which leads to the refusal of servicemen of the Armed Forces to carry out the orders of the command. Also, according to available information, mobilized residents from the occupied territory of some districts of Luhansk region are sent to replenish the losses of active units of the Russian occupation forces involved in hostilities in Ukraine.

The enemy is trying to capture Mariupol. Ukrainian soldiers successfully repulsed the attacks of the invaders. The total losses of the enemy amounted to about 150 people, 2 tanks, 7 infantry fighting vehicles and one armoured personnel carrier. After the losses, the occupiers stopped the offensive and retreated.

Artillery and aircraft inflicted fire damage on the accumulation of military equipment and enemy columns on the advance routes. According to the available information, as a result of the artillery fire, 12 units of motor vehicles were destroyed.

The battalion tactical groups from the 336th Separate Marine Brigade and the 11th Separate Assault Brigade also suffered.

No signs of preparation for a naval landing operation were found in the Black Sea and Azov operational zones. The state, position, and nature of the actions of the defense forces have not changed significantly. Ukraine's defense forces continue to successfully resist the occupiers.

During the day, the enemy did not conduct active offensive operations, focused on replenishing current losses, recruiting mercenaries from other countries, and resolving problematic issues related to the logistical support of the occupying forces operating in Ukraine. Information on the organization of mercenary training centres in Smolensk, Russia, and Gomel and Bobruisk, Belarus, has been repeatedly reported.

In the Volyn direction, the enemy keeps the group guarding the Ukrainian-Belarusian state border. At the same time, there is a high probability of provocations aimed at involving the Belarusian side in the occupation forces.

In the Polissya direction, the enemy made an unsuccessful attempt to break through the defenses of our troops in the direction of Guta-Mezhyhirska, Lyutyzh. At the same time, the occupiers were unsuccessful in capturing Makarov.

In the northern direction, the enemy is trying to increase the group, to organize logistics to resume the offensive on Chernihiv.

In the Slobozhansky direction, the main target of the enemy remains the encirclement of the cities of Sumy and Kharkiv.

In the Donetsk and Tavriya directions, the occupiers did not succeed in the Lysychansk district, suffered losses, and withdrew. In the area of Rubizhne, the enemy is trying to gain a foothold on the western outskirts of the city. Continues assault on the western and eastern outskirts of Mariupol with the support of aircraft and artillery. In the South Bug direction, the enemy is not taking active action, trying to hold previously occupied positions.

Unsuccessful in the main areas, the occupying forces continue to launch missile and air strikes on civilians, civilians and critical infrastructure in violation of international humanitarian law.

Security Service of Ukraine

The SSU detained a hacker who provided the occupiers with mobile communications in Ukraine. With the help of this collaborator: anonymously made phone calls from the Russian Federation to the invaders' cell phones in Ukraine; sent text messages to Ukrainian security forces and civil servants with offers to surrender and defect to the occupiers; transmitted commands and instructions to advanced groups of Russian invaders.

The SSU found that up to a thousand calls were made in a single day because of this hacker. A significant portion of them were from the top leadership of the enemy army.

POLICY

President of Ukraine

Responsibility for war crimes of the Russian military is inevitable - address by the President of Ukraine.

Another difficult day, which is still approaching our victory. Approaching peace for Ukraine.

As before, the enemy is confused. They did not expect such resistance. They believed in their propaganda, which has been lying about us for decades. They still can't recollect themselves. But they have already begun to understand that they will not achieve anything by war.

Their soldiers know this. Their officers are aware of this. They flee the battlefield. They abandon equipment. We take trophies and use them to protect Ukraine. Today, Russian troops are, in fact, one of the suppliers of equipment to our army. They could not imagine such a thing in a nightmare.

And I want to tell the Russian soldiers. Those who have already entered our land. And who are just about to be sent to fight against us.

Russian conscripts! Listen to me very carefully. Russian officers! You’ve already understood everything. You will not take anything from Ukraine. You will take lives. There are a lot of you. But your life will also be taken.

But why should you die? What for? I know that you want to survive. We hear your conversations in the intercepts, we hear what you really think about this senseless war, about this disgrace and about your state. Your conversations with each other. Your calls home to your family. We hear it all. We draw conclusions. We know who you are.

Therefore, I offer you a choice. On behalf of the Ukrainian people, I give you a chance. Chance to survive. If you surrender to our forces, we will treat you the way people are supposed to be treated. As people, decently. In a way you were not treated in your army. And in a way your army does not treat ours. Choose!

Our brave defenders continue to inflict devastating losses on Russian troops. Soon the number of downed helicopters of Russia will reach hundreds of units. They have already lost 80 warplanes. Hundreds of tanks and thousands of other units of equipment.

In 19 days, the Russian army has lost more in Ukraine than in two bloody and years-long wars in Chechnya. For what? I am grateful to those Russians who do not stop trying to convey the truth. To those who fight disinformation and tell the truth, real facts to their friends and loved ones. And personally to the woman who entered the studio of Channel One with a poster against the war. To those who are not afraid to protest. As long as your country has not completely closed itself off from the whole world, turning into a very large North Korea, you must fight. You must not lose your chance.

The European Union has approved the fourth package of sanctions against Russia. The fourth - and I'm sure not the last.

We are working with partners on new restrictions that will be applied against the Russian state. Everyone who is responsible for the war. Everyone who is responsible for the destruction of democracy. Everyone who is responsible for repression against people. Everyone will get an answer. The answer of the world. And this is just the beginning.

Responsibility for war crimes of the Russian military is inevitable. Responsibility for a deliberate humanitarian catastrophe in Ukrainian cities is inevitable. The whole world sees what is happening in Mariupol. Kharkiv. Chernihiv. Sumy. Okhtyrka. Hostomel. Irpin. In all our cities.

All our partners are informed of the crimes of the invaders against civilians and local self-government in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. In the temporarily occupied areas. There will be an answer for that. Necessarily. For the disrupted humanitarian corridors. Necessarily.

During the day of March 14, 3,806 Ukrainians were evacuated from the cities and towns of the Kyiv and Luhansk regions.

Our convoy with one hundred tons of what is most necessary for Mariupol is still kept in Berdyansk. For three days already. But we will try. We will do everything to ensure that Mariupol residents receive food, water and medicine.

I provided full information about the actions of the invaders on the Ukrainian land in conversations with friends and partners of our state. Every aggressive action of the invaders only pushes the world to new sanctions.

I spoke with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. With President of Poland Andrzej Duda. Prime Minister of Luxembourg Xavier Bettel. We have 100% mutual understanding.

The conversation with Prime Minister of Israel Bennett was also important. As part of a negotiation effort to end this war as soon as possible. With a fair peace.

Our delegation also worked on this in negotiations with the Russian party. Pretty good, as I was told. But let's see. They will continue tomorrow.

The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine has agreed on a package of decisions to support our economy. So that business works. So that people have jobs. Where security allows. Where people are ready for it.

First, we are starting tax reform. Instead of VAT and income tax we give a rate of 2 percent of turnover and simplified accounting. For small businesses - this is the first and second group of sole proprietors - we set a voluntary payment of a single tax. That is, if you can - pay. You can't - no questions asked.

The second is maximum business deregulation. We cancel all inspections for all businesses. So that everyone works normally. So that the cities come to life. So that life continues wherever there are no hostilities.

The only condition is that you ensure the normal operation of your business in the framework of Ukrainian law.

These are just the first two steps of our tax reform. To be continued.

And finally.

I have just signed a decree on awarding state awards of Ukraine to 234 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who showed personal courage and heroism in the fight for our land. For our independence. 59 of them posthumously.

May the memory of everyone who gave life for our state live forever!

The Russian invasion is destroying churches, mosques, synagogues and religious schools in various regions of Ukraine. While Kremlin propagandists are cynically covering up their imperial ambitions with claims to ""protect Orthodoxy,"" an aggressive attack by Russian troops is destroying Orthodox churches and other shrines in Ukraine's religious communities.

At least 28 buildings of spiritual significance (excluding adjacent buildings) have been damaged in at least six regions of Ukraine: Kyiv, Donetsk, Zhytomyr, Luhansk, Kharkiv and Chernihiv.

Today, March 14, is the nineteenth day Russia's military attack on Ukraine continues. We're reporting about all the current news. The article will be constantly updated.

What is today?

Key points.

The Command of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine informs: During the past 24hrs, four planes, three helicopters, and an unmanned aerial vehicle of the occupiers were hit by the air defense forces of the state.

In one of the strategic directions in the Kyiv region, a group of enemy aircraft of the Su-35, Su-34, and Su-25 types tried to launch missile and bomb strikes on the defensive redoubts of Ukrainian defenders. And while the Air Force fighters were in a positional air confrontation with the overwhelming forces of the occupiers, the air defenses fired anti-aircraft missiles at enemy air targets. Three hits on enemy planes were previously recorded.

Anti-aircraft missile forces also report the destruction of three Russian helicopters and one UAV.

The air defense of the North Operational Command destroyed another plane of the occupiers in the morning!

Total combat losses of the enemy from 24.02 to 14.03:

personnel – more than 12,000 people;

tanks – 389;

armored combat vehicles – 1249;

artillery systems – 150;

MLRS – 64;

air defense means – 34;

aircraft – 77;

helicopters – 90;

automotive equipment – 617;

ships / boats – 3;

fuel tanks – 60;

UAV of operational and tactical level – 8.

The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has started using the face recognition system of the American company Clearview AI, which has access to a database of 10 billion photos. 2 billion of them are from the VKontakte social media. The system will help identify Russian assailants, fight misinformation and identify the dead.

The enemies will not be able to eat at the expense of Ukraine in captivity. All Russian prisoners of war will either be exchanged for captured Ukrainians, or will serve their sentences in Ukraine and work to rebuild the destroyed infrastructure.

""We are going through the worst ordeal in our history, in our lives. We protect the most precious thing we have. We must hold on, we must fight. And we will win. I believe in that,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Today is Volunteer Fighter Day! Ukrainian volunteers are a symbol of heroism, patriotism, and courage. We will win! Glory to Ukraine!

Important! Rescuers once again ask not to spread the exact coordinates of the impact of Russian missiles immediately after the shelling and not to help the occupiers ""finish"" certain objects. This also applies to those in power. Being the first doesn't always mean being useful, says Svitlana Vodolaha, a spokeswoman for the State Emergency Service in Kyiv.

The UN Security Council is convening an extraordinary meeting on the activities of the OSCE Mission to Ukraine. Last week, the OSCE monitoring mission evacuated all its international members from Ukraine and suspended its activities since 2014.

And President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy plans to address the United States Congress on Wednesday, March 16. The Wall Street Journal reported this.

The Australian government has announced sanctions against 33 Russian rich people and their relatives.

Instagram in Russia is dead. Minus 64 million users. What ""sad"" news.

Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid has confirmed that the country is imposing sanctions on Russia. ""Israel will not be a route to bypass sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States & other western countries.

He listed the companies that continue to work in Russia:

– retail chains Leroy Merlin, Metro, Auchan, Spar;

– Pirelli and Bridgestone Tires automotive products;

– Accor and Intercontinental hotels

– Engineering companies: OTIS Worldwide, Honeywell, Mohawk Industries, Arconic;

What's in Russia?

Last night, there was a report that Russia had turned to China for military assistance, the Financial Times was the first to write, ""the Mordor is running out of resources.""

This attempt to ""feed"" the drowning army at the expense of the eastern neighbor caused great unrest among Ukrainians. But the Chinese embassy was quick to say that no requests for help had been received from Russia, according to Reuters.

Interestingly, even a quick reaction did not save China from trouble. Amid the aggressor's appeal to China for military aid, today on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the index of Chinese companies fell by 11% and they lost $2.1 trillion in one day. This is the level of toxicity!

Russia will not ask the United States and Europe to lift sanctions, Western pressure will not change Moscow's course. This was reported in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation. Excellent decision! The USSR also said so and where is it now?

The main Russian propagandist Solovyov is planned to be declared internationally wanted. He was informed about the suspicion of public calls to change the state border of Ukraine, which led to the death of people.

Another problem in Russia is that women's hygiene products have disappeared en masse from store shelves. After all, as it turned out, there are almost no sanitary pads in Russia. Even such a trifle came to the Mordor from abroad.

""The Russian armed forces don't rule out the staging of large settlements in Ukraine under full control to ensure maximum security of the population,"" said Putin's spokesperson Peskov. We listen to his delusion, but we are not afraid. In fact, the Armed Forces reject the enemy's columns, not allowing them to move inland.

У комітеті держдуми з оборони хочуть заборонити зворотний в'їзд зіркам, бізнесменам, журналістам, які виїхали з росії. Вони, звісно, поки що і самі не хочуть повертатися, але ситуація стане цікавішою, коли країни, в яких зараз окопалася бігла ""російська еліта"" приймуть рішення о примусовій депортації всіх росіян.

The State Duma Committee on Defense wants to ban the entry of stars, entrepreneurs, and journalists who have left Russia. Of course, they do not want to return yet, but the situation will become more interesting when the countries where the fleeing ""Russian elite"" is now entrenched decide to forcibly deport all Russians.

Russia may block YouTube in the near future if video hosting does not comply with the requirements of Roskomnadzor to unblock the channels of Russian propagandists.

And this is a message for those Russians who tried to circumvent the ban on Instagram and Facebook via VPN. The motherland will catch you here too, son!

There is a military camp in Belgorod, Russia, which holds servicemen who have refused to fight against Ukraine. This was announced by the officer of the Center for Operational Information of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Leonid Matiukhin.

According to him, today a special operation of the Russian Federation is being developed on the territory of Belarus. ""Today they really want to put Russian uniforms on the Belarusian military. Some of them refuse to fight against our country. But now the Russian FSB and the special services on the territory are persuading Belarusians to change into Russian uniforms and enter our territory according to Russian standards."" Ukrainian troops are ready for such a development.

❗Statement by Russian Defence Ministry

▪ On March 14, at about 11.30 a.m. Moscow time, Tochka-U tactical missile was fired at a residential block of Donetsk city from the territory controlled by the Kiev nationalist regime.

▪ The shelling of the city was carried out from the north-western direction, from the area of Krasnoarmeysk settlement, which is controlled by Ukrainian nationalist units.

▪ As a result of the explosion of a cluster warhead in the center of Donetsk, 20 civilians were killed. Another 28 people, including children, were seriously injured and taken to medical institutions.

▪ The use of such weapons on a town with no armed forces firing positions, i.e. deliberately targeting civilians, is a war crime.

▪ The armament of Tochka-U missile‘ warhead with cluster ammunition proves that the purpose of the nationalists‘ strike on the city was to kill as many civilians as possible.

❗I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the decision to use this type of missile weapons is made, at least, by the command of the Ukrainian grouping of troops, after approval by the leadership of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Kiev.

▪ All this once again confirms the Nazi and anti-human nature of the ruling regime in Ukraine today.

Eine interessante Aussage zum Angriff mit Marschflugkörpern auf das Trainingszentrum im Westen der Ukraine am Vortag: Diese Waffen wurden von russischen Flugzeugen außerhalb des ukrainischen Luftraums gestartet – auch eine Flugverbotszone hätte daran nichts geändert:

A background briefing at the Pentagon about the Russian war on Ukraine just finished. It’s Day 19 of the war.

Basic takeaways:

I’ll start with the strikes Sunday on the Ukrainian military training center at Yavoriv, near the border with Poland.

A senior U.S. defense official says they were carried out by cruise missiles launched from long-range Russian bombers from Russian airspace.

Note: That’s different than speculation and some reporting yesterday that they were carried out by sea-launched missiles from Russian ships. Those are still quite rare in this war.

“More than a couple dozen” Russian cruise missiles were launched at the training center from aircraft, the senior U.S. defense official says.

He notes that a no-fly zone patrolling Ukrainian airspace would not have stopped this strike.

The Pentagon cannot verify the number of killed and wounded at the training center. The senior U.S. defense official repeats U.S. statements yesterday that no U.S. troops, U.S. contractors, or U.S. civilians in a government capacity were there.

The Pentagon is not clear on whether any Americans there as volunteers for the Ukrainian effort were there. It’s not something they are tracking, the senior U.S. defense official says.

Russian ground advances remain largely stalled, the senior U.S. defense official says. No “appreciable” change on advances on Kyiv, Kharkiv, Mariupol, etc.

Pentagon still sees no indications of the Russians sending in military reinforcements from elsewhere in Russia, the senior U.S. defense official said.

„Siege mentality“ by Russia still playing out, the senior U.S. defense official says. Heavy bombardment of Kyiv, Kharkiv, Mariupol, etc.

Mariupol and Chernihiv remain under attack and isolated.

Senior U.S. defense official on Russia: „Clearly, they are increasing the amount of long-range fires they are applying to these cities, these population centers that are holding out … They are obviously continuing the bombardment and increasing that, no doubt about it.”

• Russland sieht sich weiterhin im Gegensatz fast zum Rest der Welt – und wendet sich auch gegen internationale Organisationen wie die Vereinten Nationen und das Internationale Komitee vom Roten Kreuz. Aus einer Mitteilung der russischen gemeinsamen Koordinierungsstelle für humanitäre Hilfe in der Ukraine (im auf Englisch veröffentlichten Original):

Western countries, the United Nations, the OSCE, the International Committee of the Red Cross, as well as a number of other international organizations, in the catastrophic humanitarian situation that has developed for Ukraine, still remain on the sidelines and do not give a principled assessment of outright neo-Nazism, which has already befuddled the Kiev authorities and reigns in the territories controlled by Ukrainian nationalists.

56,9d92ce3f-6989-4c72-bbd6-e1689d73403e,"['Tim Lister', 'Olga Voitovych', 'Tara John']",2022-03-12 00:00:00,"Kyiv, Ukraine (CNN) The Russian assault across Ukraine raged Saturday as explosions were heard in Kyiv and fighting intensified around the capital. Hours later, Russia warned the United States that it would fire on weapon shipments to Ukraine, raising the risk of direct confrontation between Moscow and a NATO country.

A number of major cities are under pressure as Russian strikes hit civilian structures. Smoke rose east of the river in Dnipro early on Saturday where CNN journalists felt at least two explosions and saw the cloudy remnants of what looked like anti-aircraft fire.

A large swath of Makariv, a village 30 miles west of Kyiv, has sustained significant damage from apparent Russian airstrikes.

CNN geolocated and verified the authenticity of photos, posted to social media Saturday, which show major damage to apartment complexes, schools and a medical facility. One of the more stark images from Makariv shows a large hole in the northern wall of an apartment building from a military strike. Many of the buildings in the photos have sustained damage on their northern facades, evidence that points to military strikes that hit them as being Russian.

In Chernihiv, some 100 kilometers north of Kyiv, local landmark Hotel Ukraine was hit overnight. ""I am here now. There is no hotel anymore,"" Vyacheslav Chaus, head of Chernihiv region administration, said Saturday.

The northern city, which is close to the Belarus border, has been surrounded by Russian forces for more than a week and video from the city showed the collapsed floors of the hotel as well as widespread damage from missiles and airstrikes.

Chaus said civilians were dying from the strikes, which brought down the city's electricity network. ""Many people are being injured. The enemy shells civilian infrastructure, where there is no military,"" he said, saying the city has ""no electricity, almost no water, gas, and heat.""

The Russian Ministry of Defense has repeatedly claimed that Russian forces are not targeting civilians.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a Saturday address the whole country was now a front line. ""A few small towns just don't exist anymore. And this is a tragedy. They are just gone. And people are also gone.""

Zelensky said negotiations to end Russia's invasion of Ukraine ""must begin with a ceasefire,"" adding that Ukraine has lost about 1,300 troops as of Saturday. CNN has been unable to independently verify these numbers.

Later Saturday, Zelensky said that he was grateful for international support but urged allies to provide more aid.

""I keep reiterating to our allies and friends abroad; they have to keep doing more for our country, for Ukrainians and Ukraine. Because it is not only for Ukraine, but it is for all of Europe,"" he said. ""The evil which purposefully targets peaceful cities and ambulance vans and explodes hospitals will not stop with just one country if they have the strength to keep going.""

The US and NATO say they're taking steps to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian troops, and they have continued to provide Ukraine with security assistance, including anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons. But the US and NATO have also tried to avoid being drawn into an outright conflict with Russia. US President Joe Biden emphasized that point on Friday, that the US will not send ground troops into Ukraine , which is not a member of NATO.

""We will not fight the third world war in Ukraine,"" Biden said after reiterating the US' full support to its NATO allies and promising that the US will defend ""every inch"" of NATO territory.

""I want to be clear though, we are going to make sure that Ukraine has the weapons to defend themselves from an invading Russian force. And we will send money and food aid to save Ukrainians' lives,"" he added.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov on Saturday warned the US against transferring weapons to Ukraine, saying convoys with foreign weapons would be considered ""legitimate targets.""

""We warned the United States that pumping Ukraine with weapons from a number of countries orchestrated by them is not just a dangerous move, but these are actions that turn the corresponding convoys into legitimate targets,"" Ryabkov said Saturday on the Russian state-run Channel One, according to state-owned RIA Novosti news agency.

Determined resistance

In Ukraine, Russia has faced defiance from the public in the past two weeks. On Saturday, several hundred people swarmed the city hall in the southern Ukrainian city of Melitopol following the detention of its mayor, Ivan Fedorov, by armed men the day before.

Shortly after Fedorov's detention, the Russian-backed Luhansk regional prosecutor claimed Fedorov had committed terrorism offenses, allegations that Zelensky called a ""crime against democracy"" on Saturday.

The Zaporozhye regional administration said Saturday a new mayor had been installed. Galina Danilchenko, a former member of the Melitopol city council, was introduced as the acting mayor on local TV, according to a statement from the regional administration posted on Telegram. In her televised statement, Danilchenko said that her ""main task is to take all necessary steps to get the city back to normal.""

She claimed there were people still in Melitopol who would try to destabilize ""the situation and provoke a reaction of bad behavior.""

""I ask you to keep your wits about you and not to give in to these provocations,"" she said. ""I appeal to the deputies, elected by the people, on all levels. Since you were elected by the people, it is your duty to care about the well-being of your citizens.""

In Kyiv, Russia's advance has faced stiff resistance from Ukrainian forces. On Saturday, the UK's Ministry of Defence's latest intelligence assessment said the bulk of Russian ground forces were about 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) from the center of the Ukrainian capital.

In Berestyanka -- 10 miles west of the airbase -- a number of fuel trucks and what Maxar says appear to be multiple rocket launchers are seen positioned in a field near trees.

Maxar satellite imagery taken on Thursday showed that the 40-mile Russian column northwest of Kyiv had largely dispersed and regrouped. But the intelligence assessment warned, ""this is likely to support a Russian attempt to encircle the city. It could also be an attempt by Russia to reduce its vulnerability to Ukrainian counter attacks, which have taken a significant toll on Russian forces.""

The north and northeastern cities of Chernihiv and Sumy, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and Mariupol in the south, remain encircled by Russian forces, the ministry added.

A senior Ukrainian official in the southern region of Kherson, now in Russian control, has said that the ""occupiers"" are pressing the regional council to agree to a referendum on the area's ""independence"" from Ukraine. There's been no word from the Russian side about any referendum plans.

Similar referendums were held after Russian-backed separatists took control in 2014 of parts of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions. People's Republics were later declared in both regions.

Ukraine's state-operated nuclear energy company said Saturday that Russian officials had arrived at Ukraine's largest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhya, demanding to take control of the facility.

Zaporizhzhya has been occupied by Russian forces for more than a week now, with Energoatom previously claiming its employees had been forced to work at ""gunpoint."" Chernobyl nuclear power plant is also under the control of Russian forces.

Despite the onslaught, Zelensky claimed on Saturday that Ukrainian forces are inflicting the ""biggest blow to Russia's army in decades,"" saying that 31 Russian tactical battalion groups had lost capability, and more than 360 Russian tanks have been lost.

Zelensky added that groups of Russian troops were surrendering to Ukrainian forces, but that Russia is now recruiting fighters, reservists, conscripts, and mercenaries to ""outnumber"" Ukrainian forces.

Russia's losses include Major General Andriy Kolesnikov, the third Russian general to have been killed by Ukrainian forces, a Western defense official confirmed on Friday. He was commander of the Eastern Military District, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense's website, and the Western official noted for context that three Russian general staff officers were killed during the whole Syrian conflict.

Deteriorating conditions

As Russia sustains losses, its bombardment of the country continues to degrade living conditions in several areas. Officials are now racing to send aid and evacuate citizens from encircled cities.

Ukrainian officials announced a fresh attempt to secure at least 13 evacuation corridors from different cities, despite reporting that only a few civilians could leave the previous day.

Addressing the besieged city of Mariupol, Zelensky said Saturday that Ukrainian forces would guarantee a ceasefire along an evacuation corridor so supplies could enter, and civilians can leave.

Ukrainian emergency employees and volunteers carry an injured pregnant woman from a maternity hospital that was damaged by shelling in Mariupol, Ukraine, Wednesday, March 9, 2022.

With relatively clear skies over Mariupol, new satellite imagery taken Saturday morning from Maxar showed the extent of the damage there, including some caused by military strikes reported earlier in the week.

In Mariupol's western neighborhood of Zhovteneyvi, a large -- still smoldering -- crater was seen near the Okko gas station. Smoke appeared to be rising from an apartment complex across the street. The roofs of warehouses down the street also appeared to have large holes from military strikes.

Within the apartment complex, several buildings seemed to have sustained significant damage. A debris field was seen surrounding some of the buildings with a large smoke plume.

Just northwest of the gas station, an additional satellite image showed impact craters dotting a snow-covered field. Vehicle tread marks were also seen. Just more than a mile south, in an industrial area in the Primorskyi neighborhood, a large fire was seen raging.

There was some good news amid the destruction. A pregnant woman, whose rescue from the Mariupol maternity hospital this week was captured in a viral AP photo, gave birth to a baby girl, her family told CNN.

Mariana Vishegirskaya was among a number of women at the Mariupol maternity hospital who survived the shelling.

Her aunt Tatiana Liubchenko said the baby was named Veronica but she was worried about the situation in the city. ""We got the information that the water and food of the people there are running out and we are very worried, because the green corridor is not opened and the Russians do not allow, the food does not come. And it's so cold there right now so they can't get warm,"" Liubchenko said.

The fighting has displaced around 2 million Ukrainians in the country, the UN said Friday, and 2.5 million people have fled its borders.",https://edition.cnn.com/2022/03/12/europe/russia-invasion-ukraine-03-12-intl/index.html
57,9d92ce3f-6989-4c72-bbd6-e1689d73403e,"['Tim Lister', 'Mohammed Tawfeeq', 'Olga Voitovych', 'Simone Mccarthy', 'Tara John']",2022-03-13 00:00:00,"Kyiv and Lviv, Ukraine (CNN) Russia expanded its offensive to western Ukraine on Sunday, firing missiles near the city of Lviv and hitting a large military base close to the Polish border, reportedly killing dozens of people and drawing the war closer to the borders of a NATO country.

The attack came the day after the Kremlin threatened to attack Western weapons shipments to Ukraine.

As the invasion runs into its third week, the northwest city of Lviv has largely been spared from Russia's relentless bombardment. The picturesque city has instead become ground zero for displaced Ukrainians. Hundreds of thousands of them have flooded into the city in search of relative safety, with many using it as a stopping point before making their way to the Polish border about 43 miles (70 kilometers) away.

But Russia's war is moving closer to the cultural hub. Russian forces fired more than 30 missiles at Yavoriv military training ground on Sunday, according to Lviv's military administration. Located between Lviv and the Polish border, the military base has held joint drills with NATO and Western military personnel, including the United States.

A witness, who was on the base when the strike happened, told CNN of hearing a ""sudden clap"" from a bomb shelter, adding that the explosion craters were 10 meters deep and there are fears people are under the rubble.

Local authorities say 35 people were killed and 134 injured at the military base, in what Ukraine's Minister of Defence Oleksii Reznikov described as a ""terrorist attack"" on peace and security ""near the EU-NATO border.""

There were no reports of foreign nationals among the casualties so far, say Ukraine defense officials. The strike came the day after Russia launched a missile attack in the northeastern city of Lutsk, only 70 miles from the Polish border.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday that it was only a matter of time before Russia's military assault on Ukraine expanded to members of NATO -- unless the alliance installs a no-fly zone in Ukraine.

""Last year, I made a clear warning to NATO leaders that if there were no tough preventive sanctions against Russia, it would start a war,"" Zelensky said in a video address Sunday posted to his Facebook page. ""Now, I repeat again, if you do not close our sky, it is only a matter of time before Russian missiles fall on your territory. NATO territory. On the homes of citizens of NATO countries.""

US national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN that the strikes on Lviv were a sign that the war was not going to plan. Russian President Vladimir Putin ""is frustrated by the fact that his forces are not making the kind of progress that he thought that they would make against major cities, including Kyiv, that he is expanding the number of targets, that he is lashing out, and that he is trying to cause damage in every part of the country,"" Sullivan said.

Ambulances are seen traveling to and from the Yavoriv military base on March 13, 2022.

A senior US official told CNN Sunday that Russia has asked China for military assistance in Ukraine, including drones. Potential assistance from the Chinese would be a significant development in Russia's invasion, and could upend the hold Ukrainian forces still have in the country.

When asked by CNN about reports of Russia's request for military aid, Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in the US, said in a statement, ""I've never heard of that.""

As attacks on civilian areas continued throughout the weekend, a new round of Russian-Ukrainian talks has been set for Monday.

Zelensky alluded to the talks in his remarks Sunday, saying his country's delegation ""has a clear task -- to do everything to ensure a meeting of the presidents. The meeting that I am sure people are waiting for.""

US President Joe Biden spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday evening, according to a White House official. Macron had spoken to Putin on Saturday in a joint call with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

American journalist killed in Ukraine

Heavy fighting continued Sunday, with Britain's Ministry of Defense saying Russia was attempting to ""envelop"" Ukrainian forces in the east of the country as it advanced from Crimea westwards towards Odessa.

Russian troops continue to focus on the capital Kyiv. Ramzan Kadyrov, the pro-Kremlin leader of Russia's Chechnya region, reportedly told Russian soldiers outside of Kyiv that the key task is to seize the capital, Russian state news network Russia 24 reported on Sunday.

Brent Renaud is pictured at the Peabody Awards Ceremony in New York City on 2015.

Amid a growing civilian toll in Ukraine, American journalist Brent Renaud, 50, was killed by Russian forces in Irpin, on the outskirts of Kyiv, according to social media posts by Kyiv region police. Two other journalists were wounded by Russian troops, the police added.

Renaud ""paid with his life for attempting to expose the insidiousness, cruelty, and ruthlessness of the aggressor,"" an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister, Anton Gerashchenko, said in a statement on Telegram.

The US State Department confirmed Renaud's death on Sunday. ""We are horrified that journalists and filmmakers—noncombatants—have been killed and injured in Ukraine by Kremlin forces,"" department spokesman Ned Price said on Twitter. ""This is yet another gruesome example of the Kremlin's indiscriminate actions.""

Social media footage has emerged of a journalist identified as Juan Arredondo, a filmmaker and visual journalist who is also an adjunct professor at Columbia Journalism School, at Okhmatdyt hospital in Kyiv, in which he describes being shot at by Russian forces while driving through a checkpoint in Irpin on the way to film refugees leaving the city.

The exact circumstances of the attack against the two journalists are yet to be determined.

TIME released a statement Sunday saying Renaud was in the region working on a TIME Studios project on the global refugee crisis.

""We are devastated by the loss of Brent Renaud. As an award-winning filmmaker and journalist, Brent tackled the toughest stories around the world often alongside his brother Craig Renaud,"" TIME Editor in Chief and CEO Edward Felsenthal and President and COO Ian Orefice in the statement.

Ukrainians take to the streets to protest

Ukrainians continue to protest Russian occupation. The southern city of Kherson, which is occupied by Russian forces, saw the biggest protest since the invasion on Sunday. Hundreds of demonstrators flocked to the streets to protest against suspected Russian plans to turn the southern Ukrainian oblast into a breakaway republic.

Residents of Kherson turned out en masse on Sunday, March 13, in the largest protest the city has seen since the invasion began and it came under Russian occupation.

Waving Ukrainian flags, the protesters chanted anti-Russian slogans, filled with expletives about Putin, according to videographer Artem Ivanov, who is on the ground in Kherson.

Ihor Kolykhaiev, the mayor of Kherson, said in a video posted on Facebook Sunday that mass protests show ""Kherson is Ukraine"" and insisted that he retains administrative control of the city.

But the mayor also said that the city had been cut off from humanitarian aid and was running out of resources. He said that the city ""can't receive a humanitarian cargo here, food is finishing in the stores, we are running out of gas, we only have diesel oil left at the gas stations. We are running out of the medications and insulin.""

""Our main weapon is unity,"" he added.

In recent days, at least one Kherson regional council official warned that occupation forces were laying the groundwork for the ""Kherson People's Republic."" If true, the move would mirror Moscow's establishment of two Russian-backed breakaway states in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.

Putin recognized the independence of those two territories in the days leading up to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine as part of his pretext to launch an assault on the country.

School demolished by Russian strike

Russia's air offensive on Sunday also bore down on heavily populated areas around the country. Nine people were killed in a Russian bombardment in Mykolaiv Sunday, local officials said. The strategic southern city has resisted Russian occupation and impeded an apparent push towards the major port of Odessa to the west.

A school in the village of Zelenogai, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) east of Mykolaiv, was demolished by a Russian military strike, Mykolaiv regional administrator Vitali Kim said.

Kim said that the military strike left several people either dead or in critical condition. ""Some people got under the rubble and we are evacuating them,"" Kim said.

Missiles also destroyed an airport in the western Ukrainian city of Ivano-Frankivsk, while the northern city of Chernihiv was struck for the third night in a row, hitting a high-rise building, the regional head, Vyacheslav Chaus, said.

In the eastern region of Luhansk, much of which is now occupied by Russian forces, the head of the regional administration, Serhiy Haidai, said there had been ""massive shelling"" of several towns, including Kreminna and Rubizhne, which had prevented buses from leaving with civilians.

The Ukrainian military thwarted an attempt by Russian military vehicles to cross the Irpin River on a pontoon bridge near Hostomel, a new satellite image from Maxar Technologies shows.

The bridge first appeared in satellite imagery from Maxar on March 10, appearing to have been destroyed. An additional photo, published on social media on March 13, also shows the pontoon bridge destroyed, in addition to nearby Russian military vehicles.

Ukrainian forces in Kyiv's suburb of Irpin have so far repelled the Russian forces' attempted advance towards the Ukrainian capital city. With the main bridge crossing the Irpin River having been destroyed by the Ukrainians, the river poses a significant obstacle for the Russian military.

Also on Sunday, Ukraine's National Energy Company Ukrenergo completed repair work and resumed power supply to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the company announced. The plant's electrical system was damaged during a Russian attack on March 9. Later on Sunday, the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement that the staff at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant are so tired they have stopped carrying out the repair and maintenance of safety-related equipment.

As the devastation mounts, Zelensky said the key task Sunday is to get the humanitarian convoy that is traveling towards the besieged city of Mariupol to its destination. Mariupol has been under siege for more than a week. Much of the city is without power and water.

Mariupol's city administration confirmed Sunday night that the convoy was still stuck some 50 miles to the west.

As the city waits, officials said it had suffered 22 bombing attacks in the last 24 hours and ""to date, 2,187 Mariupol residents have died from attacks by Russia.""

Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said that nine of the 14 evacuation routes declared Sunday had allowed civilians to escape fighting. About 3,950 people were rescued in the Kyiv region and 1,600 were able to escape from the Luhansk region in the east of the country, according to Vereshchuk.

""The city of Mariupol was subjected to shelling and aerial bombardment all day long,"" Vereshchuk said. ""The humanitarian cargo remained blocked in the city of Berdyansk halfway to the occupied city.""

New round of talks

Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podoliak said Sunday that the next round of Russian-Ukrainian talks will take place on Monday, via video link.

""Again. Negotiations go non-stop in the format of video conferences,"" Podoliak said on Twitter. ""Working groups are constantly functioning. A large number of issues require constant attention.""

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian state news agency RIA earlier on Sunday that the talks would continue on Monday.

Podoliak said earlier Sunday that he believed that talks in the next few days will ""achieve concrete results.""

""Our proposals are on the table. They are very tough. Among them, the withdrawal of troops, the ceasefire,"" Podoliak said in a video posted on Twitter.

This comes after Leonid Slutsky, a Russian delegation member for talks with Ukraine, said ""significant progress"" has been made in negotiations with the Ukrainian delegation since the beginning of talks, Russian state news agency RIA reports.

Talks between Ukraine's and Russia's top diplomats last week in Turkey, however, yielded no discernible progress.

In Russia, authorities continue to violently repress all dissent. Riot police arrested more than 658 people in 35 Russian cities on Sunday, as the number of those detained grows, according to an independent human rights group, OVD-Info.

Images of brutal arrests have flooded social media showing people dragged off the streets by Russia's riot police. OVD-info also reported cases of house searches of human rights activists, police officers stopping people on the street to check through bags, as well as phone records.

According to the monitoring group, more than 5,000 people have been arrested across Russia for participating in anti-war protests since last weekend and over 14,633 protesters have been detained in dozens of cities since the start of the invasion on February 24.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/13/europe/russia-invasion-ukraine-03-13-intl-hnk/index.html

LONDON — Three European leaders staged a defiant show of support for Ukraine on Tuesday, traveling to its besieged capital, Kyiv, even as a relentless Russian artillery bombardment left apartment towers in the city ablaze, forcing terrified residents to flee into the street with only the clothes on their backs.

The dramatic visit by the prime ministers of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia, which unfolded in tight secrecy as they crossed the Ukrainian border by train after dawn, was a strikingly personal gesture. But it caught other European leaders off guard, angering some and baring uncomfortable divisions in how best to demonstrate Western solidarity with Ukraine.

It also came as President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia disparaged the second consecutive day of negotiations with Ukraine, undercutting the faint glimmers of hope raised from talks the day before that both sides were looking for a way to halt the war.

The Kremlin slapped retaliatory sanctions on President Biden and other senior American officials. Mr. Biden announced his own plans to travel to Europe next week to showcase the unity of the NATO alliance in the face of Russian aggression.

A spokesman for Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said the three visitors were “de facto” representing the European Union in Ukraine. In Brussels, however, officials said the trio did not have the E.U.’s blessing, and some European diplomats complained that the trip was too risky, given the Russian forces encircling Kyiv.

Others said they admired the audacity of the group, which also included Prime Minister Petr Fiala of the Czech Republic and Prime Minister Janez Jansa of Slovenia, casting it as a powerful symbol of the backing for Ukraine among countries on Europe’s eastern flank, where the specter of Russian aggression looms larger than in Paris or London.

Still, for all the symbolism of standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine’s leaders under the threat of Russia’s rockets, Ukraine was facing the devastating barrage largely on its own. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, imposed a 35-hour curfew, starting on Tuesday evening, which suggested the capital was entering an even more difficult phase of its grinding struggle to hold off Russian troops and tanks.

“This is their attempt to annihilate the Ukrainian people,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in an emotional video address to the Canadian Parliament, repeating his plea for NATO to enforce a no-fly zone over the country. “It is an attempt to destroy our future, our nation, our character.”

Mr. Zelensky asked the lawmakers to imagine if the CN Tower in Toronto were shelled like the towers in Kyiv. His language has become more pointed, even scolding, with each speech to a Western audience, revealing his frustration with leaders who have resisted more direct military involvement out of fear that it would entangle them in a wider conflict with Russia.

The Ukrainian leader, who has become a hero to many in the West, is scheduled to speak via video to Congress on Wednesday, where he is expected to amplify his pleas for more help and increase the pressure on the United States and its allies.

Mr. Biden is planning to announce $800 million in new security assistance to Ukraine on Wednesday, according to White House officials. The administration last week announced $200 million in security assistance for Ukraine and has made available a total of $2 billion in such funding.

On Tuesday evening, the Polish state broadcaster carried video of the Czech, Slovene and Polish leaders meeting Mr. Zelensky and other officials across a long table, with Ukraine’s blue-and-yellow flag behind them.

The Prime Ministers of 🇵🇱 @MorawieckiM, 🇸🇮 @JJansaSDS and 🇨🇿 @P_Fiala arrived on the behalf of @EUCouncil to #Kyiv today. The courage of true friends of 🇺🇦! Discussing support of #Ukraine and strengthening sanctions against the Russian aggression. — Denys Shmyhal (@Denys_Shmyhal) March 15, 2022

“They are here to support us,” Mr. Zelensky said at a news briefing after the meeting, which also was shown on Ukrainian television. “It is a great, courageous, right, friendly step. I am confident that with such friends, such countries and neighbors and partners, we can really win.”

A photograph posted earlier on Mr. Morawiecki’s Twitter account showed the three men poring over a map, seated in what appeared to be a train carriage en route to the Ukrainian capital.

“It is here, in war-torn Kyiv, that history is being made,” Mr. Morawiecki said in the Twitter post. “It is here, that freedom fights against the world of tyranny. It is here that the future of us all hangs in the balance.”

The White House announced that Mr. Biden would fly to Brussels for an extraordinary summit meeting of NATO on March 24. That may result in further economic and military aid for Ukraine but will likely fall short of Mr. Zelensky’s request for a no-fly zone. Administration officials declined to say whether Mr. Biden planned to meet with the Ukrainian president, whom he has called a hero. But they said Mr. Biden may go on to somewhere in Eastern Europe to meet with refugees streaming out of Ukraine.

The river of people fleeing the war continued unabated on Tuesday, as Russia claimed to have seized control of the strategic Kherson region in the south. Russian forces kept up their pounding of civilian targets in Kyiv, where Ukrainian troops were fortifying intersections with sandbags, tires, and iron spikes.

A pre-dawn rain of rockets on Kyiv shattered windows, left craters in buildings, and turned a 16-floor apartment house into a towering inferno. The fire spread quickly after a missile struck the building, blowing a jagged hole at its entrance. Firefighters rescued residents from windows by ladder through billowing smoke. By midafternoon, they had carried out two bodies encased in black bags.

“I came out with nothing,” said Mykola Fedkiv, 85, a retired geologist. “I left everything, my telephone, my medicines, everything.”

When the missile struck, Mr. Fedkiv fled his 12th-floor apartment and made his way down the stairs. He climbed through the blasted entrance hall and found himself in the bomb crater. People pulled him out by his arms. He stood outside for hours, hoping to re-enter his apartment to collect personal documents. Asked where he planned to stay the night, he responded, “God knows.”

Conditions were even more desperate in the coastal city of Mariupol, which has been pummeled by Russian forces in a two-week siege that has left some residents crushed in the rubble and many others dying in a winter freeze with no heat, food, or clean water. Officials can no longer account for the number of dead and missing.

Officially, 2,400 civilians killed in Mariupol have been identified, but Pyotr Andryushchenko, an adviser to the city government, said he believed the toll was far higher, possibly as many as 20,000. Ukrainian estimates of the number of people trapped have ranged from 200,000 to 400,000.

Mr. Andryushchenko said 2,000 vehicles had managed to escape Mariupol on Tuesday and that another 2,000 were packed and ready to leave. Officials told civilians to “delete all messages and photos from phones” in case Russian soldiers searched them for signs of support for Ukrainian forces.

The perils of reporting accurate information from Ukraine’s combat zones were further underscored Tuesday with news that a Fox News cameraman and a Ukrainian colleague had been killed in an attack on Monday outside Kyiv — raising to at least three the number of journalist fatalities in Ukraine in the past few days.

In Kherson, a southern city under Russian occupation, the mayor said that members of Russia’s national guard were rounding up activists who opposed Russia’s presence, possibly trying to recruit them through coercion.

“They’re all in the city, in the jail,” the mayor, Igor Kolykhaev, wrote in several text messages, referring to the activists. Russian troops, he said, “collect them, hold them, work them over and release them.”

Kherson was the first major city to fall to Russian forces after the Feb. 24 start of the invasion. Although Kremlin officials had predicted that the Ukrainian people would welcome their “liberation” by Russian troops, residents of Kherson have been defiant, regularly gathering in the central square to protest the Russian presence, even when Russian troops fire into the air to disperse them.

Russia claimed to have captured the entire Kherson region, potentially strengthening its ability to push west toward the strategic port cities of Mykolaiv and Odessa. A senior Ukrainian military official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that Russian forces were in control of much of the Kherson region, but said Ukrainian forces were attacking their positions and inflicting losses.

Negotiations via video link between Russia and Ukraine continued for a second day on Tuesday, though Mr. Putin doused prospects of any imminent breakthrough. In a phone call with the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, Mr. Putin complained that “Kyiv is not demonstrating a serious attitude toward finding mutually acceptable solutions,” according to the Kremlin.

Mr. Putin also continued to struggle in the information battle with Ukraine. On Tuesday, President Emmanuel Macron of France said his country could offer diplomatic “protection” to a Russian state television employee who was detained and fined over an on-air antiwar protest on Monday.

The employee, Marina Ovsyannikova, burst onto the live broadcast of Russia’s most-watched news program on Monday evening, yelling, “Stop the war!” and holding a sign that read, “They’re lying to you here.”

Russia also faced further isolation from Britain, which imposed sanctions on more than 370 people it labeled oligarchs, political allies of, or propagandists for Mr. Putin. Among those blacklisted: Dmitri A. Medvedev, the former president of Russia; Mikhail Mishustin, the current prime minister; and Mikhail Fridman, the billionaire founder of Alfa Bank, one of the country’s largest private banks.

Russia, for its part, said it had sanctioned 13 Americans including Mr. Biden, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III in response to American sanctions against Mr. Putin and other officials. Also on its list was Hillary Rodham Clinton, the former secretary of state, and Mr. Biden’s son, Hunter Biden.

Mr. Biden’s press secretary, Jen Psaki, shrugged off the news, suggesting in jest that the Kremlin’s announcement might have missed its intended mark. The president, Ms. Psaki said, is a “junior, so they might have sanctioned his dad by mistake.”

New military clothes were laid on top of his body, before the coffin lid was closed.

“My child is gone. There's no granddaughter or grandson. There's nothing. Life is empty now,” she wept.

The cadet with Ukraine's air defence forces had been stationed in the northeastern city of Kharkiv at the start of Russia's invasion. His mother, Irina, had been unable to reach him on the phone for nearly two weeks. Now the authorities had delivered his body back to his home town, Mykolaiv, for burial.

As the family waited for Eduard's coffin to be loaded into the back of a van, to be taken to a church, the occasional rumble of artillery was clearly audible.

More than 100 military bodies have passed through the town's main mortuary in the past three weeks, and more than 40 civilians. Nikolai, an attendant helping organise the bodies said in the past fortnight, he had been home only once.

“It's very intensive. We are not going home, we are living here. We are spending all our life here,” he said.

Mykolaiv, a ship-building city on Ukraine's Black Sea coast with around 450,000 inhabitants, has been under attack by Russian troops pushing into Ukraine from Crimea since nearly the start of the invasion. Taking the city would open a road to the port of Odesa, around 60 miles west.

The UK Ministry of Defence earlier this week reported that frustrated Russian forces may be attempting to now go round the city as they look to drive west towards Odesa. The port, once one of the jewels of imperial Russia, represents a significant prize for Vladimir Putin and would also choke off Ukraine's sea trade.

Yet while Russian forces may be skirting Mykolaiv, shells continue to fall on it.

8:36 p.m.: VOA White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara reports that President Joe Biden is expected to announce on Wednesday an additional $800 million in new security assistance to Ukraine, bringing the total announced in the past week alone to $2 billion, according to White House officials. The announcement will come on the same day Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is to speak to a joint session of the U.S. Congress.

7:32 p.m.: The U.S. Senate unanimously passed on Tuesday a resolution condemning Russian President Vladimir Putin as a war criminal, a rare show of unity in the deeply divided Congress. The resolution, introduced earlier this month by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and receiving bipartisan support, states the Senate “strongly condemns the ongoing violence, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and systematic human rights abuses continually being carried out by the Russian Armed Forces and their proxies and President Putin’s military commanders, at the direction of President Vladimir Putin.” It encouraged the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague and other nations to target the Russian military in any investigation of war crimes committed during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

7:09 p.m.: Ukraine Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal tweeted that the presence of Prime Ministers Petr Fiala of the Czech Republic, Janez Jansa of Slovenia and Mateusz Morawiecki of Poland, who traveled to Kyiv to meet with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy showed the “courage of true friends.”

6:04 p.m.: VOA’s Jeff Seldin shares the latest British defense briefing, which among its findings: “Russia is redeploying forces from as far afield as its Eastern Military District, Pacific Fleet and Armenia.”

5:35 p.m.: VOA’s Eastern Europe Chief Myroslava Gongadze, reporting from the Medyka border crossing in Poland, spoke with U.S. Embassy in Ukraine Charge d’Affaires Kristina Kvien. Kvien later tweeted “how Ukrainians are fighting an inspiring battle.”

4:42 p.m.: Dmitry Rogozin, head of Russia’s State Space Corporation called Roscosmos and the former deputy prime minister of Russia’s defense industry, tweeted Tuesday that “the only thing we can do to help our fighting army now is to clean out the Fifth Column” -- often defined as secret sympathizers of an enemy that engage in espionage or sabotage -- “And this is a task - perhaps even more important than the speed of advance of our army.”

3:58 p.m.: Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian children have become refugees since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty interviewed several Ukrainian refugee children in Poland and Lithuania and produced this report. The children offer their reflections on the horrors of war, and on politics.

3:42 p.m.: “A convoy of 11 trucks carrying 200 tons of aid from the International Committee of the Red Cross, the German Red Cross and other partners of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement has reached Ukraine,” according to an ICRC statement released Tuesday. “The assistance will soon be delivered to locations around the country based on security conditions, access and where the needs of civilians fleeing from and enduring conflict are most pressing. A priority will be to deliver assistance to people displaced from their homes and living in shelters,” the agency added.

3:28 p.m.: U.S. President Joe Biden signed a spending bill that includes nearly $14 billion in additional assistance to Ukraine Tuesday, and some top officials of his administration are crediting aid already provided by the United States with helping the Ukrainians hold off the Russian invaders, according to VOA’s Chief National Correspondent Steve Herman. Biden said the package — which contains military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine — comes on top of the $1.2 billion in U.S. security assistance already provided to the country. “With this new security funding and the drawdown authorities in this bill, we’re moving urgently to further augment the support to the brave people of Ukraine as they defend their country,” Biden said

3:11 p.m.: U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and State Department officials have been in touch with Fox News’ management, according to spokesperson Ned Price, regarding correspondent Benjamin Hall, who was injured Monday in Ukraine in an attack that killed two of his colleagues.

Russia said in its statement that “the measure is a response” to U.S. sanctions against Russian entities and individuals and that the action “became an inevitable consequence of an extremely Russo-phobic direction taken by the current U.S. administration.” Americans on the list won’t be able to travel to Russia starting on March 15. Russian authorities also threatened to expand the sanctions list to include lawmakers, experts, businessmen and media personalities that “encourage hate against Russia.”



Psaki downplayed the issue Tuesday, saying “None of us are planning tourist trips to Russia and none of us have bank accounts that we won’t be able to access.”

2:59 p.m.: In Donetsk, Ukraine, people are volunteering for a crash course in how to care for the wounded, as they seek ways to help during the current crisis. VOA’s Yaroslava Movchan has the story, narrated by Anna Rice.

2:48 p.m.: Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has prompted tens of thousands of middle-class Russians to flee abroad as they stare at a bleak future in their increasingly isolated homeland. But due to an ever-increasing number of crippling sanctions piled upon Russia, they don’t have many destinations to choose from, with many Western countries restricting visas for Russian citizens. Farangis Najibullah has this report for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

2:35 p.m.: Millions of Ukrainians have now fled their country, mostly to Poland, but also to Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Moldova. In Hungary, there are reports of some Ukrainians deciding to turn back. VOA’s Gabor Ancsin filed this report on Hungary’s border with Ukraine, narrated by Jon Spier.

2:26 p.m.: In Photos: Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine, March 15, 2022

2:21 p.m. : A Russian state media employee detained after her anti-war protest on live TV has appeared in court and was fined $280. Marina Ovsyannikova held up a sign during a live broadcast on Russian’s Channel One on Monday that read in Russian, “NO WAR. Stop the war. Don’t believe propaganda. They are lying to you.” The bottom line, in English, read, “Russians against war.” She was accused of violating the country’s protest laws. It is unclear if she will face additional charges. VOA News reports.

2:21 p.m.: More than 100 buses carrying civilians have left the besieged city of Sumy in northeastern Ukraine for a safe area, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said Tuesday. “In total, more than 100 buses are traveling in two different convoys, a joint operation between us and the Ukrainian Red Cross,” ICRC spokesperson Jason Straziuso told Reuters in Geneva. The buses were heading towards Poltava, in central Ukraine, but might not be able to take a direct route, he said, adding that the Russian side had given a green light for the evacuation.

2:08 p.m.: The United States on Tuesday announced more sanctions on Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko for his role as an ally of Russia during the invasion of Ukraine. The sanctions will block Lukashenko and his wife from accessing U.S. property and limit the ability of Americans to conduct business with them. The U.S. has already sanctioned Lukashenko over the Ukraine invasion, including limiting technological exports.

2 p.m.: The prime ministers of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia arrived in Kyiv to meet with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday.

1:56 p.m.: Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty asked Muscovites on the last day of McDonald’s operations in Russia if they would miss the popular fast food chain. McDonald’s has announced it is temporarily closing all its stores inside Russia in response to the invasion of Ukraine.

1:41 p.m.: Russia on Tuesday formally quit the Council of Europe, a human rights watchdog based in Strasbourg, pre-empting possible expulsion over its attack on its neighbor Ukraine, according to Reuters. Pyotr Tolstoy, head of the Russian delegation at the Council’s Parliamentary Assembly, handed a letter from Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to the Council’s secretary general announcing Moscow’s decision, the Tass news agency reported.

1:15 p.m.: U.S. President Joe Biden is now scheduled to travel to Brussels to attend a NATO summit March 24, as VOA’s White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara reports.

1:10 p.m.: In a briefing Tuesday, White House spokesperson Jen Psaki paid tribute to FOX News cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski, who was killed following an attack in Ukraine Monday. “He was a war zone photographer who covered nearly every international story for Fox News, from Iraq to Afghanistan to Syria during his long tenure working there,” Psaki said. “Our thoughts, our prayers are with his family, with the entire community as well.” VOA’s Press Freedom Editor Jessica Jerreat reports that as a result of the same attack, Zakrzewski died as did Ukrainian journalist Oleksandra Kuvshynova, while Fox News correspondent Benjamin Hall was injured and remains hospitalized.

12:45 p.m.: A Russian state media employee has been released from detention after protesting Russia’s war in Ukraine on live TV, VOA’s Press Freedom Editor Jessica Jerreat reported Tuesday. Speaking to journalists after her release, Marina Ovsyannikova says she was questioned for 14 hours and denied access to a lawyer or her family. She was fined 30,000 roubles ($280) for breaking protest laws, according to the RIA news agency. The fine is believed to be related to a video she posted online before her anti-war protest during a live broadcast on Russia’s Channel One studio on Monday.

12:35 p.m.: A second journalist was reported to have died Tuesday, following an attack on her media team in Ukraine on Monday. The Vienna-based International Press Institute said that Ukrainian journalist Oleksandra Kuvshynova was killed alongside veteran cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski. FOX News correspondent Benjamin Hall was injured in the attack. The U.S. broadcaster says the vehicle they were in was struck by incoming fire.

12:26 p.m.: Ukraine has come under 3,000 cyberattacks since Febuary 15, Victor Zhora, deputy chair of the country’s State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection, told journalists in a briefing Tuesday, as VOA’s Jamie Dettmer reports.



Russia is focusing its cyberattacks on Ukraine’s critical infrastructure in the digital war, targeting the public and financial sectors and telecommunications, Zhora said. It has been seeking to disrupt Ukraine military communications and the military’s communication with Ukraine’s political leaders, he added.



Russia’s cyberwar campaign has mainly been comprised of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. But he confirmed there have also been so-called wiper attacks, overwriting or removing data from the Ukrainian systems targeted.



Zhora said Ukraine’s cyber-defenses have benefited from volunteer groups. “Specialists have self organized and are working to help on the cyber front,” he said. Ukraine is focused on its own cyber-defense and is not mounting cyber-attacks on Russia, Zhora said. But he acknowledged hacker groups have been doing so, saying he is “grateful for their efforts.”

12:14 p.m.: VOA’s Eastern Europe Chief Myroslava Gongadze reports from an international aid station for refugees at the Poland-Ukraine border.

For the past few years, Russia’s disinformation apparatus has seemed unstoppable. But as Russia’s armed forces have been caught wrong-footed on the battlefield in Ukraine by a smaller, agile and more motivated opponent, so, too, its propaganda operation has seemed flat-footed. The storylines promulgated by the Kremlin at it seeks to shift blame for its own actions on to others, and to cast its invasion as defensive in nature, have struggled to gain the traction Russian propagandists might have expected, they say. VOA’s Jamie Dettmer has more.

11:51 a.m.: The American network FOX News on Tuesday announced that journalist Pierre Zakrzewski died from injuries sustained in an attack in Horenka, near Kyiv, on Monday. Zakrzewski was with FOX correspondent Benjamin Hall when their vehicle was struck by incoming fire, FOX chief executive Suzanne Scott said in a statement to staff. Hall, a British American journalist, remains in the hospital, where he is being treated for injuries.

11:45 a.m.: China says it does not want to get caught up in the diplomatic and economic blowback Russia is facing from Western nations over its invasion of Ukraine.

11:33 a.m.: Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmygal said on Tuesday the government would finance a loan program for farmers worth $846 million as part of a raft of new measures to ease the economic shock of war, Reuters reports. In a video address, Shmygal also outlined new tax breaks for small and medium-sized businesses that were approved earlier by parliament.



11:24 a.m.: A senior German official predicted Tuesday that the war in Ukraine and its impact on fossil fuel prices worldwide will provide a “massive boost” for the means and measures needed to curb climate change, The Associated Press reports.



Patrick Graichen, Germany’s deputy energy and climate minister, said rising global prices for oil, gas and coal will accelerate the uptake of low-emission technology that simultaneously reduces countries’ reliance on imports from Russia.



“The core technologies to become independent of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and to drive forward climate protection are the same,” he told reporters in Berlin. “They are renewables, they are efficiency, and electrification,” said Graichen. “These three will now get a massive boost,” he added.

11:15 a.m.: On Tuesday, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba posted on Twitter a photo of himself smiling next to Lithuania’s Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis. He said it was the first official visit by a foreign minister since Russia invaded Ukraine. The visit comes on the same day that the prime ministers of the Czech Republic, Poland, and Slovenia are traveling to Kyiv in an ""unequivocal"" show of support to Ukraine.

10:53 a.m.: The State Department announced sanctions on 11 key members of Russia’s defense enterprise Tuesday, adding to a long list of sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other western countries following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. VOA’s Correspondent Nike Ching has the details.

10:36 a.m.: An overwhelming majority of refugees from Ukraine are fleeing to European Union countries. Ukrainians already enjoy visa-free travel to the European Union for up to 90 days. Recently, the European Union’s executive branch, the European Commission, activated the Temporary Protection Directive, which grants immediate protection to those fleeing the war while providing access to schools, medical care, and work. VOA’s Immigration Correspondent Aline Barros reports on what this means for the millions of Ukrainian refugees on the move.

10:21 a.m.: Russia will put forth its own draft of a resolution regarding the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, Moscow's ambassador to the United Nations said on Tuesday. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia also said Russia will stop its invasion when the goals of its special military operation are achieved in Ukraine, including demilitarization.



Meanwhile, the sponsors of a draft Security Council resolution on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, that has been in negotiation for two weeks, said they will not seek a vote in the council but will take it to the wider membership in the General Assembly. “Obviously, it would have been difficult in the Security Council, no need to explain to you why,” France’s envoy Nicolas de Riviere said in response to a reporter’s question. Russia holds a veto in the 15-nation council.



“We think it’s time to take action to move to the General Assembly and have the whole membership supporting an initiative on humanitarian access, on cessation of hostilities, on respect of international humanitarian law, on respect of the Geneva Conventions,” Ambassador de Riviere said. “So, we are very optimistic we can do that. The sooner the better. The situation on the ground deteriorates by the hour.” VOA’s UN Correspondent Margaret Besheer is following the developments.

9:54 a.m.: While tens of thousands of people have fled Ukraine every day since Russia’s invasion, a small but growing number of women are heading in the other direction, The Associated Press reports.

Motivated by a desire to help loved ones in trouble or contribute to the defense and survival of their country, these women are braving the bombs and heading into Ukraine.



“I will go back and help. I am a health worker, so the hospitals need help,” said Iryna Orel, 50, tugging her luggage before boarding a train from Przemysl, Poland, to Lviv, in western Ukraine. “And I will stay until the end.”



“I am returning to Ukraine to help people evacuate too,” said Maria Khalica, who lives in Italy but was planning to travel to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. “I am in a more stable state now than my friends, who are under rocket attacks and bombs.”

With Ukraine’s government ordering men to stay and fight, the vast majority of people fleeing Ukraine have been women, children and the elderly, according to national officials and the U.N. refugee agency.

9:33 a.m.: As Russia’s President Vladimir Putin continues his crackdown on media outlets, many observers are asking how members of the Russian public are getting their news about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Natasha Yefimova-Trilling is a news editor at Russia Matters, a project at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center that provides research and analysis on Russia and U.S.-Russia relations to policymakers and the public. In an interview in The Harvard Gazette, she cites recent research and anecdotal evidence to examine the media landscape in Russia now.



9:21 a.m.: The prime ministers of the Czech Republic, Poland, and Slovenia are traveling to Kyiv on Tuesday in an ""unequivocal"" show of support to Ukraine as Russia continues its assault on the country. The three leaders will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Prime Minister Denis Shmyhal.



Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, and Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa are traveling to Kyiv by train and crossed from Poland into Ukraine before noon, Michal Dwoczyk, an aide to Moraweicki, told reporters. The Polish leader called it a historic mission.



The three leaders will arrive in a city that is still under bombardment, forcing many people to spend nights sheltering in underground stations. Hosting the foreign prime ministers in his own capital would be a symbolic success for Zelenskiy, who has stayed in Kyiv to rally his nation with nightly messages. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has the story.

9:12 a.m.: There were more Russian attacks on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv Tuesday, with shells hitting several residential buildings. At least two high-rise buildings in the Svyatoshyn district were heavily damaged and set ablaze. Correspondent Levko Stek, with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, reported from the site of another attack in the city’s Kurenivka district that killed one person and injured 10 on Monday. He spoke with Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko, who said the attacks were further proof that Russian forces are targeting civilians.

8:56 a.m.: A lawyer representing the Russian state media employee detained for her anti-war protest on live TV, says he cannot find his client, VOA Press Freedom Editor Jessica Jerreat reported Tuesday.



Marina Ovsyannikova held up a sign during a live broadcast on Russia’s Channel One on Monday, that read in Russian: “NO WAR. Stop the war. Don’t believe propaganda. They are lying to you.” The bottom line in English, read, “Russians against war.”



Ovsyannikova could face charges under a law that bans discrediting the armed forces, according to Russia’s Tass state news agency. Ovsyannikova was detained but her lawyer Pavel Chikov says more than 12 hours later she still has not been located. He added on social media that the police investigation does not include “grounds for detention and imprisonment.""

The Kremlin on Tuesday said Ovsyannikova’s actions amount to “hooliganism,” Reuters reported. A spokesperson for the U.N. Human Rights Office said at a briefing Tuesday Russia should ensure that Ovsyannikova “does not face any reprisals for exercising her right to freedom of expression.”

8:45 a.m.: Memorable reports illustrate both the skill and gutsiness of female journalists serving as eyewitnesses to Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine and the way their presence — hard-won after overcoming ingrained notions of why women shouldn’t cover combat — has changed the nature of war reporting. They cover the tactics of war but give equal measure to its toll.

8:30a.m.: Kyiv’s mayor Vitali Klitschko has announced a 35-hour curfew for Ukraine’s battered capital starting at 6pm local time Tuesday to 7am Thursday following heavy bombing that left several high-rise apartment blocks badly damaged in the Svyatoshynskyi and Podilskyi districts. The mayor confirmed that four people died in the airstrikes Tuesday morning. One 15-story apartment block was engulfed in a blaze, VOA’s Jamie Dettmer writes from Warsaw, Poland.



Klitschko said special permission would be required to move around the city without special permission. “The capital is the heart of Ukraine, and it will be defended. Kyiv, which is currently the symbol and forward operating base of Europe’s freedom and security, will not be given up by us,” he added. Also Tuesday, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy issued a life or death ultimatum to Russian soldiers, urging them to surrender.

Ukraine planned to make a new attempt to deliver supplies to the besieged city of Mariupol on Tuesday as the first convoy of civilians allowed out by Russia reached safety and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) issued a dire warning about the situation, Reuters reports.



Also Tuesday, the Red Cross said it is hoping to organize the evacuation of two convoys of some 30 buses with civilians out of the besieged northeastern Ukrainian city of Sumy and their passage to a safe area.



Ewan Watson, a Red Cross spokesperson, told a U.N. briefing in Geneva that the operation would be carried out with the Ukrainian Red Cross but was not underway yet. He noted there had been delays with similar evacuations from Mariupol, where he said people are “essentially being suffocated in this city now with no aid.”

7:37 a.m.: The International Organization for Migration says more than 3 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded last month, The Associated Press reports. The new milestone also indicated that some 157,000 third-country nationals – people who are not Ukrainian – were part of the outflow in what U.N. officials have called the largest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.



IOM spokesman Paul Dillon said at a U.N. news briefing in Geneva on Tuesday that the totals were compiled from figures provided by national authorities.



The U.N. refugee agency UNHCR, which provides a more detailed count than the IOM though based on similar data, has reported that more than 1.8 million of the refugees were in Poland. UNHCR spokesman Matthew Saltmarsh said some 300,000 had moved on from there to Western Europe and noted that the vast majority of those fleeing have been women and children.

6:47 a.m.: Russian officials have said that they will move to nationalize the assets of Western companies that pull out of their country over its invasion of Ukraine. But White House press secretary Jen Psaki warned that Russia could face further sanctions or legal action if it goes forward with the nationalization plan. ""Any lawless decision by Russia to seize the assets of these companies will ultimately result in even more economic pain for Russia,"" she wrote. VOA’s Rob Garver has this story.

6:20 a.m.: Some analysts say China is trying to buy time until it is able to come up with the appropriate policy response to the changing situation in the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Friday said the U.S. and China should not “close” a cultural door between the countries as economic sanctions against neighboring Russia intensify. Though the sanctions target Russian trade, they will have wide-ranging impact on Chinese companies and banks that deal with Russian entities. For VOA, Saibal Dasgupta reports from New Delhi.

5:30 a.m.: The battle over Ukraine’s fate is happening on multiple fronts, with U.S. officials flying around the globe to meet with civilians who have been affected by the carnage, but also speaking virtually and in person with officials from other countries who have a role to play in ending this conflict.

4:27 a.m.: Britain’s Foreign Office is investigating reports that three former British army servicemen were among the 35 killed in a Russian missile strike Sunday on a military training base in western Ukraine near the Polish border, VOA’s Jamie Dettmer reports from Warsaw, Poland. All three men reportedly were formerly members of the U.K.’s special forces.

It is now estimated by Ukrainian authorities that at least a dozen missiles struck the facility, one of Ukraine’s biggest military training camps, located 25 kilometers from the Polish border. Ukrainian air-defense batteries intercepted other missiles as they hurtled towards the base at Yavoriv, 60 kilometers from Lviv, a major hub for Ukrainian evacuees fleeing the country.

The strike on the International Center for Peacekeeping and Security is the westernmost attack by Russia so far, and has raised fears that Lviv may soon embroiled in the conflict.

The report said the economy is expected to shrink by 10% in 2022, but that could become worse depending on the length of the conflict. The IMF is expected to approve $1.4 billion in emergency funding for the country.

The IMF applauded Ukraine’s efforts to keep its financial system functioning and to fulfill its obligations despite the crisis.

“Making wage and pension payments, restocking ATMs with cash, opening bank branches ... continuing to make payments on external debt obligations, so that post-war they can resume normal operations with their creditors and markets. It’s really actually a remarkable, remarkable effort,” Ivanna Vladkova Hollar, the IMF mission chief for Ukraine said, according to Reuters.

1:15 a.m.: Negotiators from Russia and Ukraine are due to hold more talks Tuesday as Russia presses its nearly three-week invasion with bombardments of Kyiv and other major Ukrainian cities.

A round of negotiations Monday, held by video rather than in-person in neighboring Belarus like previous sessions, yielded still no major signs of a breakthrough.

Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted after Monday’s talks, “Communication is being held yet it’s hard.” He had raised hope of progress on Sunday by saying Russia had been “listening carefully to our proposals” and was beginning to talk “constructively.”

12:51 a.m.: An employee of Russian state-run Channel One interrupted a live broadcast of the nightly news Monday shouting “Stop the war! No to war!”

News staffer Marina Ovysannikova, whose father is Ukrainian, held up a placard in Russian, saying, “Don’t believe the propaganda. They’re lying to you here.” Studio producers rushed to cut her off, VOA’s Jamie Dettmer reports.

This is the second time Russian One has had a problem controlling the message. Last week, on the popular talk show hosted by Vladimir Soloviyev, two pundits broke ranks and likened the war raging in Ukraine to Russia’s quagmire in Afghanistan in the 1990s.

During the broadcast filmmaker Karen Shakhnazarov said Russia’s invasion risked isolating the country. He called for the war to stop, and warned: “If this picture starts to transform into an absolute humanitarian disaster, even our close allies like China and India will be forced to distance themselves from us.”

Later during the broadcast guest Semyon Bagdasarov, an academic, said: “Do we need to get into another Afghanistan, but even worse?”

VOA’s Eastern Europe Chief Myroslava Gongadze reflects on her friend and former Nieman fellow.

Renaud went to Ukraine to report on refugees feeling the conflict. He was shot dead, and his colleague, Juan Arredondo, who was with him when they came under fire, was injured. VOA’s press freedom editor Jessica Jerreat reports.
