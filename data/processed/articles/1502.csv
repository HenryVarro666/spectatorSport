Kramatorsk Station Missile Strike

A Russian missile strike at Kramatorsk railway station on Friday 8th April, 10:30am local time, appears to have killed many civilians, with the publicly announced death toll standing at 57 dead and 114 wounded.

Published casualty figures for earlier Russian missile strikes are widely believed to be underestimates, such as the attack against Yavoriv ‘Ukraine-NATO Partnership For Peace’ Military Base on 13th March (where international volunteers were receiving rudimentary training).

Kramatorsk is an important node in the infrastructure network connecting embattled Ukrainian forces in East Donbas to the rest of the country.

East Donbas, or, ‘The Leaky Cauldron’

From an early stage in the Russian invasion, Russia state-affiliated media has taken to identifying the East Donbas sector of the conflict as ‘the Cauldron’. Primarily this term emerged as part of the attempt to craft a positive narrative around Russia’s failure to secure large territorial gains in the war.

Reading the combat fronts was the wrong way to view Russia’s strategy, pundits declared. Russia’s aims were actually to destroy the Ukrainian Army, and one of the main areas this would be achieved was East Donbas.

The idea was that East Donbas was an area with a significant concentration of Ukrainian troops, and would be liable to being cut off from resupply. East Donbas is a strategic ‘salient’, or ‘bulge’, where the Russians should theoretically be able to bring more firepower to bear against the defenders and prosecute a successful attack over the long term. Having partially surrounded this ‘cauldron’, the Russians can ‘turn up the heat’.

The failure to properly disconnect the defenders in East Donbas from the rest of Ukraine has meant that if East Donbas is a cauldron, it has so far proved something of a leaky cauldron. Advances southward from Izyum appear to have been decisively stalled, with similar performance along the southern front of this sector. If Russia is to make progress in this war, they will need to achieve a major success in East Donbas over the coming weeks.

Explosions in Donetsk, probably due to Ukrainian shelling, took out an electrical substation on Bakhmetieva street. Russian shelling continues in the vicinity of Maryinka, East Donbas, as Vuhledar, Krasnohorivka, and Avdiivka are hit.

A Russian military convoy was recorded in Novozybkov, north of Ukraine, allegedly recycling to Donbas.

Satellite imagery near Kharkiv from April 8th showed a Russian military convoy moving south through Velykyi Burluk, en route to East Donbas.

A Russian ammunition warehouse near Luhansk was allegedly destroyed by Ukrainian bombardment. Another ammunition warehouse south of Velyka Novosilka was destroyed on Saturday 9th, 18:45 local time, according to drone footage.

On April 9th, 32 Su-35 ‘Flanker’ fighter jets were identified at Voronezh Malshevo airbase, 200km from the Ukrainian border.

A ‘high’ security threat has been declared in the Russian city of Kursk, in anticipation of Ukrainian military or sabotage operations.

Kherson-Mykolaiv Standoff

The combat front between Mykolaiv and Kherson has remained stable for many days, with both sides appearing to trade artillery fire across the 30 mile distance between the two cities.

The situation north of this region appears to be more fluid, with Ukrainian operations aiming to clear villages south of Kryviy Rih, while reports of Russian shelling and bombardment continue.

Mariupol Siege Ongoing

The siege of Mariupol continues. A fair amount of footage continues to emerge from Azov defenders, though there is a possibility that some of this material is from previous skirmishes (and released in small amounts in order to convey an impression of continued successes in the beleaguered city).

Russia has released footage claiming to show the destruction of a Ukrainian armoured vehicle by a Russian-made combat drone.

A recent claim by the Ukrainian Army that ‘around 40’ Russian vehicles were destroyed during a strike on a warehouse near Volnovakha, has been verified, with 35 vehicles destroyed.

It is possible that the vehicles were stored in such a dense concentration in order to hide them from aerial and satellite reconnaissance, decreasing the probability of a fatal airstrike — however, that same concentration resulted in a large toll of vehicles when the hidden unit was discovered and hit.

Missile Strikes and Air Defences

The Russian Ministry of Defence claims to have destroyed S-300 surface to air missile (SAM) systems at Chuhuiv airbase (near Kharkiv) and Starobohdanovka (near Mykolaiv), while also claiming the destruction of a National Guard base at Zvonetske south of Dnipro.

The mayor of Dnipro states that the ‘total destruction’ of Dnipro airport following repeated missile strikes. Fragments of a high-precision Russian missile were recovered near Huliaypole, north of Polohy, east of Zaporizhzhia.

On Friday 8th April, Slovakia transferred its S-300PMU SAM systems to Ukraine, according to local footage.

Kharkiv Bombardment Continues

Dozens of incidents of Russian shelling continue around Kharkiv on a daily basis, ranging from MLRS Grad and Smerch rockets, artillery, and ‘tanks’. According to the head of the regional administration, 66 such incidents took place within a 24 hour period.

Kiev

Footage has emerged showing previous combat operations around Kiev, which were abandoned by the Russians on 30th March.

Following the Russian withdrawal from Kiev and North Ukraine, thousands of foreign journalists have descended upon the capital to gather footage and make reports. One photo shows 6 journalists photographing a cat, while a hundred others swarm a column of burnt-out, rusting Russian vehicles (we do not publish these photos here since the copyrights to such media are owned by AP, AFP, Reuters, and other journalistic footage cartels, whose business activities revolve around reselling this footage in packets to wealthy mainstream news outlets).

1,222 Kiev residents were killed by the Russian Army during the five-week occupation of outlying districts, according to the Ukrainian Attorney General.

According to the World Bank, the economy of Ukraine is set to contract by 45.1% this year, with Russia’s contracting 11.2%. Over 10% of Ukraine’s pre-war population has already left the country as refugees, with the majority in Poland.

Kherson Misinformation

It has been claimed that during a protest against Russian occupation on 10th April (day 46), Russian troops opened fire to disperse protesters. However, the footage appears to be a badly edited version of a clip that emerged on 5th March, and was widely circulated in international media.",https://www.lotuseaters.com/ukraine-conflict-day-44-to-46

But if obsolete radars of the vessel, are not able to track more than 1 target, there are multiple S-400 radars in Crimea, that according to rumours, spread by their manufacturers, could track ""more than 1 aerial target"". Than no exchange of data even between major assets

Russian Telegram channels discussing why powerful air defense of cruiser Moskva has not responded to subsonic cruise missiles, suggesting that it was busy with tracking TB2 drone elsewhere.

And of course, Russian Telegram channels, even of prominent propagandists/top influencers want retaliation ""erase Odesa from the face of Earth"" ""Odesa should be destroyed to the ground"". Cruiser Moskva was a legitimate military target, Odesa is not

But if obsolete radars of the vessel, are not able to track more than 1 target, there are multiple S-400 radars in Crimea, that according to rumours, spread by their manufacturers, could track ""more than 1 aerial target"".

Probably, without airborne radars(e.g. A50) that seems impossible for trajectories Odesa region - Zmeinii island

Neptune rockets fly 10 meters above sea level, maybe S-400 in Crimea would have some issues tracking that?

Russian Ministry of Defense claims another TB2 destroyed on the ground at Dnipro airfield (no more ""Dnipropetrovsk"" as in previous reports) #41 , 113% of Bayraktar TB2 destroyed

According to Russian numbers it would be Bayraktar #40 (of total 36). 111%

Fighting in eastern and southern Ukraine is still heavy. The Russian Army is advancing slowly, while the AFU are being strengthened by European arms deliveries. The conflict is escalating into prolonged positional battles, where the sides wait for each other’s mistakes.

In the Severnaya Saltovka area in northeastern Kharkiv, the AFU continues to reinforce its defense in the civilian areas. The Russian military is regrouping in eastern Ukraine and plans to move towards Kharkiv. This was reported by Kirill Budanov, head of military intelligence of Ukraine.

In the Izyum direction, the Russian Armed Forces are advancing and destroying incoming AFU reinforcements and continue to form a strike force to develop an offensive on Slovyansk. Near Izyum, Russian forces are attempting to expand the bridgehead on the southern bank of the Severskiy Donets River.

Heavy fighting continues in Popasna and Mariinka.

110th tank repair plant in Kharkiv. 10 tanks loaded onto railway platforms:

In the Zaporizhzhya and Huliaypole regions, the front lines remain unchanged. Russian forces are expected to offence in this area after taking full control over the city Mariupol. To the east of Huliaypole, separate clashes for some small settlements continue, but no important movement of the Russian troops is expected before their reinforcement.

There is also fighting in Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, where there are heavy fires after shelling. After a massive artillery shelling of Severodonetsk, LPR forces reportedly attempted to storm the city. The AFU units repelled the attack.

Footage from the 29th checkpoint, after it was stormed by the LPR army (21+):

The Ukrainian Armed Forces shelled residential areas of Rubizhne and Donetsk with heavy artillery. A cistern with nitric acid reportedly exploded for the second time in Rubizhne.

On Tuesday, militants blew up a tank containing hydrochloric acid. A poisonous cloud hung over the city for several hours. LINK

On Saturday evening, the provocation reportedly repeated. In Rubezhnoye, the Armed Forces of Ukraine blew up a tank with nitric acid.

The Ukrainian Armed Forces are trying to move forces to the east to reinforce the AFU groupings deployed in the Donbass region.

Slovyansk has been turned into a fortress city where 30,000 AFU soldiers and 200 MLRS systems are deployed. All-new weapons from the US, UK, France, and Germany are sent to the eastern front, 24 thousand weapons are already in service with the AFU.

Russian tanks are firing at the Ukrainian military in the Slovyansk direction. The artillery of the Russian Armed Forces is shelling the AFU near the village of Dolhonkoye. It is near the border of the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions, in the direction of Slovyansk.

Now there is a build-up of Russian forces at the bridgehead on the southern bank of the Donets River for upcoming operations to take control over the Slovyansk-Kramatorsk agglomeration and Barvenkovo.

After the bloody attack on the train station in the town of Kramatorsk on April 8, which left at least 57 civilians dead, new evidences confirmed the guilt of the AFU. The fact that the Tochka-U missile was a Ukrainian one was revealed thanks to Italian journalists who showed its series number. LINK

In Kostyantynivka, Kramatorsk District of the DPR, the AFU equipped firing positions and deployed heavy weapons in the buildings of local schools No. 2 and No. 15, the city hospital, and residential buildings located on Yemelyanov Street.

In the city of Mariupol, the AFU units, including nationalist fighters, are trapped in the Azovmash facilities. The area is still being mopped up by Russian and DPR troops. Ukrainian troops left Azovmash B, with Russian units advancing from the north, west and east joining in near the second bridge. The intensity of local fighting is lower than the fighting for Azovstal.

The asphalt concrete plant which is part of a large industrial zone in the north of Mariupol and is adjacent directly to the territory of the Ilyich plant, was taken under the control of the DPR.

In the Primorsky district in the right-bank part of the city, intense fighting continues. Fighting for the 7th micro district has ended. Fierce clashes continue in the seaport area. The AFU remain in control over the administrative buildings in the Primorsky district and high-rise buildings along the Lenin Street.

Fighting continues in the left-bank part of the city. The bridge from the right bank to Azovstal was undermined.

One can note the positional nature of the clashes and emphasize the importance of airstrikes on the enemy positions by each side.

At the same time, the Kiev regime continues its bloody offensive in the media. Such provocations as the missile attack in Kramatorsk are being spread into the information field and become the object of media discussions to blame one of the parties to the conflict. Meanwhile, other bloody provocations remain silenced. This was the case of the bloody attack on civilians in the center of the city of Donetsk.

It is difficult to predict how events will develop further, since on the one hand there are successes of the Russian army in the south and southeast of Ukraine, and on the other hand Ukraine is constantly receiving military assistance from the EU, the UK and the USA. In the short term, the balance of power is unlikely to change; Russia’s advantage lies in its strategic positions, while Ukraine’s advantage lies in material assistance from the West.
