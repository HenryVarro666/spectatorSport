The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

1,4441534b-5a0f-4983-ad56-48d765a9d585,[],2022-02-24 00:00:00,"Ukraine's armed forces are heavily outnumbered and outgunned by Russia's, but as Russia begans a large-scale invasion on Thursday, military experts say they would be capable of mounting significant resistance and inflicting heavy casualties.

Ukraine's army is also better trained and equipped than in 2014, when Russia captured the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine without a fight and is widely seen as highly-motivated to defend the country's heartland.

So, how does Ukraine's military stack up against the invading Russian forces?

How do the numbers look?

In terms of manpower and weapons, the arithmetic looks grim for Ukraine.

Most military experts' estimates put the number of Russian troops near Russia's border with Ukraine at more than 100,000. Russia has also moved some troops to Belarus, north of Ukraine, for military drills.

Russia's army has about 280,000 personnel and its combined armed forces total about 900,000, while its 2,840 battle tanks outnumber Ukraine's by more than three to one, according to the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).

Ukraine's prime minister said a decree recently signed by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy - on priority measures to strengthen the state's defence capabilities, increase the attractiveness of military service and the gradual transition to a professional army - would eventually bring Ukraine's armed forces to 361,000 personnel.

Although Ukraine trebled its defence budget in real terms from 2010 to 2020, its total defence expenditure in 2020 amounted to only $4.3 billion (€3.8 billion), just a tenth of Russia's.

Military analysts say Ukraine's anti-aircraft and anti-missile defences are weak, leaving it highly vulnerable to Russian strikes on its critical infrastructure. They say Russia would also seek to use its superiority in electronic warfare to paralyse its adversary's command and control and cut off communications with units in the field.

How experienced are Ukraine's forces?

Ukraine's forces have gained combat experience in the Donbass region in the east of the country, where they have been fighting Russia-backed separatists since 2014, and are highly motivated.

They also have short-range air defences and anti-tank weaponry, including US-supplied Javelin missiles, which would help to slow any Russian advance.

Beyond the regular army, Ukraine has volunteer territorial defence units and around 900,000 reservists. Most adult males have at least basic military training, so Russia could find itself facing stubborn and protracted resistance if it tried to capture and hold onto territory.

The military challenge would be incomparably higher than in previous wars Russia has fought since the Soviet Union's collapse, including in breakaway Chechnya in the 1990s and against Georgia in 2008.

What tech or hardware has the West given to help?

Western countries have stepped up arms deliveries to Ukraine, but Kyiv says it needs more. The United States has ruled out sending U.S. troops to Ukraine to fight.

The United States has provided more than $2.5 billion (€2.2 billion) in military aid since 2014, including Javelin anti-tank missiles, coastal patrol boats, Humvees, sniper rifles, reconnaissance drones, radar systems, night vision and radio equipment.

Further supplies could include Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, small arms and boats.

Turkey has sold Kyiv several batches of Bayraktar TB2 drones, which it deployed against Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.

Britain supplied Ukraine with a reported 2,000 short-range anti-tank missiles in January and sent British specialists to deliver training. It has also provided Saxon armoured vehicles.

Estonia said it was sending Javelin anti-armour missiles and Latvia and Lithuania are providing Stinger missiles. The Czech Republic has said it plans to donate 152 mm artillery ammunition.

Germany has ruled out arms deliveries to Ukraine but is co-financing a $6 million (€5.3 million) field hospital and providing training.",https://www.euronews.com/next/2022/02/24/how-does-ukraine-s-army-size-up-to-the-russian-war-machine-the-numbers-make-for-grim-readi

3,4441534b-5a0f-4983-ad56-48d765a9d585,[],,"Russia weapon: The Russia-Ukraine war has been going on for a month.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) on Thursday that Russia has used phosphorous bombs, which killed “adults and children”. As the war in Ukraine is intensifying, Russia has been using more and more dangerous and deadly weapons to achieve success in the assault launched about a month ago. The Ukrainian army is also giving Russians stiff resistance using the weapons provided by the West. Some of these weapons have inflicted serious damage to Russian artillery and tanks.

Here is a look at the weapons used in the Russia-Ukraine War:

Phosphorus bombs

Phosphorus is a substance used by militaries across the world to cause smoke, illumination and incendiary munitions. It burns brightly when exposed to air and produces a large amount of smoke. Phosphorus is used to mark enemy targets and produce a smokescreen to hide troop movements. Zelensky said today that phosphorous used by the Russian military, while igniting, gave serious burns to the targets.

Kinzhal missiles

These are the hypersonic missiles used by Russia I the Ukraine war. Kinzhal, Russian for “dagger”, was launched from the air, most likely by a MiG-31 warplane, according to the BBC. Hypersonic missiles can travel at more than five times the speed of sound, or Mach 5. According to Russia, Kinzhal has a range of 2,000 kilometres. The length of the missile is 8 metres.

9K720 Iskander ballistic missile

The Iskander missile used by Russia in Ukraine

These short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs) are leading the Russian attacks in Ukraine. The Iskander has the precision to hit targets 500 kilometres away. These missiles have destroyed homes, hospitals and schools in many Ukraininan cities. The Iskander is a multipurpose tool which comes in various versions - bunker buster, smart submunition, thermobaric and even EMP.

""Vacuum"" bombs

Thermobaric bombs are one of the most brutal war weapons.

Also called thermobaric weapons, these are one of the most brutal war weapons that exist. The bombs are filled with explosive and chemical mix, which causes supersonic blast waves on explosion. These waves can obliterate everything in their path. They are also called vacuum bombs because these explosives suck in the oxygen from the surrounding the air to generate a powerful explosion. Several videos have been posted by Ukrainians, which show Russian thermobaric bombs destroying key structures in cities.

Cluster bombs

Russia was accused of using cluster bombs in an attack on Ukrainian pre-school in which a child was killed. These bombs scatter small bomblets over a wide area, which can result into a significant number of casualties. They can pose a huge risk to civilians present in the area. Human Rights Watch (HRW) and other rights group have claimed that these bombs were used by Russia in the civil war in Syria. Though an international treaty bans the use of these cluster bombs, Russia is not a signatory to it.

War planes

The Russian military has used 75 fixed-wing bomber planes to target Ukrainian airbase and other targets, according to Ukraine's Defence Ministry. These planes are capable of firing air-to-ground missiles or cluster bombs to inflict quick and significant damage to the Ukrainians. Apart from these, there are also reports of the use of Mi-8 choppers.

Javelin missiles

The US-made anti-tank missiles are in high demand in Ukraine. These weapons are giving the numerically inferior Ukrainian army a chance to wreak havoc on their attackers. Javelin has been developed by Lockheed Martin, which said on its website that the missile guides itself to the target after launch (“fire and forget” system), allowing the gunner to take cover and avoid counterfire, or load a new missile.

Bayraktar TB2 drone

Turkish-made Bayaraktar drones have been used extensively by the Ukrainians.

Another weapons used by the Ukrainian military against the Russians. This is a Turkish-made drone that can remain airborne for 27 hours.

Next Generation Light Anti-Tank Weapon (NLAW)

NLAW is very effective in destroying enemy targets at a short distance.

Weighing just 12.5 kilograms, NLAW is a portable, shoulder-launched system that can be used by a single operator. Its armour-piercing warhead can destroy a heavily protected modern battle tank with one shot, and the system is effective at ranges between 20 and 800 metres.

Stinger Surface-to-Air Missile

The Ukrainian military has received the Stinger missile from the US.

Bloomberg/Getty Tension between Russia and its western neighbor, Ukraine, erupted into war in late February 2022, when Russian leader Vladimir Putin launched what Ukrainian officials called a ""full-scale invasion."" For weeks, even as Moscow insisted it had no plans for an invasion, it had been moving troops and weaponry closer to Ukraine's borders. Today, satellite photos continue to capture Russia's military deployments — and its grim capabilities — as the invasion grinds on. Here's a look at Russia's recent military movements and deployments in the region — from the weeks leading up to the invasion through the latest developments — as well as a survey of the kinds of weapons Moscow tends to use in battle.

Disturbing implication in the air Maxar Technologies The dark shapes in this photo are what a group of Russian ground-attack helicopters — with one in the air — looked like on February 25, the day after the attack on Ukraine began. This is a closeup of more than 50 helicopters (along with additional troops and equipment) gathered at the Bokov airfield, near Mazyr, Belarus.

Russian bombs Maxar Technologies This Maxar satellite photo shows the aftermath of a Russian bombing on February 28, 2022. The smoldering building is a factory, west of Chernihiv, Ukraine.

Burning homes Maxar Technologies This satellite image shows impact craters and burning homes in Rivnopillya, northeast of Kiev.

Ground forces at the ready Maxar Technologies This deployment of Russian ground forces was photographed via satellite on February 25. Belarus — a key economic and political ally of Russia — hosted this deployment northeast of Chojniki, a town that, in 1986, faced heavy radiation from Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear accident.

Tanks in a row Maxar Technologies This satellite photo, taken by Maxar Technologies, shows tanks lined up on a practice firing range. This image was taken January 26 over the Pogonovo training area, in western Russia. The exercise represented a ramping-up of local military training activity, including live-fire artillery and maneuver training, in staging areas near the Russia's border with Ukraine.

Downed bridge Maxar Technologies On February 28, the Ukrainian city of Chernihiv faced heavy Russian attack. The city is home to more than 280,000 people. The satellite photo clearly shows a bridge that's been destroyed.

Housing for troops Maxar Technologies This satellite photo captures a row of tents in Yelnya, Russia, about 160 miles from the Ukraine border. This photo is significant to border watchers for several reasons. Note that some tents have no snow on them — likely because they have been heated, indicating that they are currently occupied.

Newly arrived troops Maxar Technologies Here's another area believed to be housing recently arrived troops, this time at a training ground in Novoozernoye, in Crimea. This photo was taken by satellite imaging company Maxar Technologies on February 1.

Toward the curving road, there's another gathering of vehicles that have likely just come off the rails.

Just how close is close? Stephen Wood/Maxar Technologies This map graphic, provided by Maxar Technologies, shows the various areas where the satellite imaging company has recently taken photos indicating a buildup in Russian military might. The neighboring country of Ukraine is also shown for reference.

""Battle groups"" Maxar Technologies Analysts say that this satellite photo shows a ""battle group"" of various military vehicles, many of whom have arrived over the past several weeks. The image was taken January 19.

Ice fields Russian Defense Ministry Press Service via AP This photo, taken from video and released by the Russian Defense Ministry Press Service on February 7, 2022, shows a detachment of warships passing through ice fields in La Perouse Strait, from the Sea of Japan to the Sea of Okhotsk. The Russian military has launched a series of drills amid tensions with the West over Ukraine.

Attack aircraft on the ground Maxar Technologies Six SU-25 aircraft are seen at the Luninets airfield in Belarus in early February. The staging may be linked to expected joint exercises between Russia and Belarus. But this image is also consistent with supplemental videos showing Russian forces moving through Belarus and building field camps within 20 miles of the Ukrainian border.

Tanks and tents Maxar Technologies This satellite photo of Russia's Pogonovo training area, taken January 16, shows several types of recently-arrived military equipment and weapons. Toward the bottom left are some of Russia's SS 26 Iskander short-range ballistic missiles. Further to the right is a group of tanks, thought to be enough for a tank battalion. And furthest to the right is self-propelled artillery — essentially, guns on a tank chassis.

Beefed up Maxar Technologies This satellite photo shows rows of military vehicles amassing in Yelnya, Russia, about 160 miles from the Ukrainian border. The presence of military equipment is fairly routine for this area — but not this many, analysts say. Tent camps can be seen on the bottom right.

Rocket launchers? Maxar Technologies Here's a closer view of what are believed to be SS26 Iskander and multiple rocket launchers. This was taken northwest of Yelsk, in Belarus, on February 4, 2022.

Possible division Maxar Technologies Analysts say the Russian military will often park equipment from the same deployment division together when preparing for a battle. Analysts may call these areas ""vehicle parks,"" basically a large military parking lot. This image was taken January 19, 2022, in Yelnya, Russia.

Warships on the move Russian Defense Ministry Press/ AP Here's another screen grab, released by the Russian Defense Ministry Press, depicting its warships doing drills in the in La Perouse Strait. It was released February 7, 2022.

Closer view of tanks Maxar Technologies Here's a closer view of additional tanks, artillery and support equipment recently arrived in Yelyna, Russia, on January 19. This finding fits a pattern that analysts are seeing across western Russia — deploying new units to existing holding facilities or training areas.

Impact craters Maxar Technologies This satellite photo was taken over the Persianovsky training area, 30 miles from the Ukrainian border, on January 28. Artillery impact craters, likely from a very recent live firing exercise, can be seen.

View from the clouds Russian Defense Ministry Press Service via AP This image, taken from video and released by the Russian Defense Ministry Press Service on February 7, shows a view from the cockpit of a Russian Su-30SM fighter jet as it flies over Belarus during joint drills. Moscow has deployed troops and weapons to Belarus, adding to a buildup of Russian forces near Ukraine, fueling fears of an invasion.

Repeating history Maxar Technologies This isn't the first time that satellite images have captured troop and equipment buildups on Russia's border with Ukraine; a similar buildup was captured via satellite in April 2021. This photo, showing an increase in deployments to the Pogonovo training area, was taken January 16. Vehicle parks with tanks and tent camps housing troops can be seen.

More heated tents? Maxar Technologies This satellite photo, taken February 1 of the Angarsky area of southern Crimea, shows new rows of troop tents. Notice the lack of snow on the tents, an indication that they may be heated and occupied.

Armored personnel carriers Maxar Technologies Unlike Pogonovo and other training areas, Klimovo is more of a military storage area and staging ground. Here's a satellite shot of newly arrived armored personnel carriers and trucks at the facility, taken January 19, 2022.

Abandoned or not? Maxar Technologies Recent Maxar satellite images are thought to show more than 350 vehicles parked at an abandoned ammunition storage facility near the Russian town of Klintsy, a town near where Ukrainian, Russian and Belarusian borders meet. This photo was taken on December 25, 2021.

6,4441534b-5a0f-4983-ad56-48d765a9d585,['Angela Dewan'],2022-02-25 00:00:00,"(CNN) Heavily armed Russian troops are pushing rapidly towards Ukraine's capital of Kyiv, and US officials are warning the city could fall within days.

The military capabilities of these two nations are so imbalanced that Ukraine's defiant president, Volodymyr Zelensky, implored his Western allies overnight to do more than impose sanctions to get Russian troops off Ukrainian soil.

Here's how the two country's military capabilities stack up.

Defense spending

Russian tanks move across the town of Armyansk in northern Crimea.

Just a look at the amount of money the two nations spend on defense gives an indication of the gap between the two. Ukraine spent $4.7 billion in 2021, just over a tenth of nuclear-armed Russia's $45.8 billion, according to ""The Military Balance"" report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), published last week.

While the Russian government launched a drive in 2008 to modernize its military, after a brief war with Georgia laid bare equipment shortfalls, Ukraine's weapons are still largely from the Soviet era. In its ambitions to join NATO, however, Ukraine has reorganized the structure of its armed forces, and has plans to re-equip its air force with Western combat aircraft by the mid-2030s. It also plans to improve its naval capability.

Manpower

Ukrainian servicemen sit atop armored personnel carriers on a road in the Donetsk region, eastern Ukraine on Thursday.

Where Russia has 900,000 active personnel in its armed forces, and 2 million in reserve, Ukraine has 196,000 and 900,000 reservists. Ukraine on Wednesday began conscripting reservists aged 18-60, according to IISS.

In land forces alone, Russia has a twofold advantage, with 280,000 troops to Ukraine's 125,600. And its air force is nearly five times as strong, with 165,00 to Ukraine's 35,000.

But in terms of how many troops are in this particular operation, Yohann Michel, a research analyst who worked on the IISS report, said Russia had an estimated 200,000 personnel in and around Ukraine.

""That's including around 60 battle groups. The situation is evolving rapidly and that number could change, but it's very large, and that's important. It's one of the largest in eastern Europe that we've seen in years -- in my lifetime,"" Michel told CNN.

""Ukrainian numbers are more difficult because everything they have is now mobilized and they have called in reservists.""

Weaponry and vehicles

A Ukrainian infantry combat vehicle standing guard on the outskirts of Kyiv on Tuesday.

There is a lot to compare here -- attack aircraft, armored vehicles, surface-to-air missiles -- but in general, Russia simply has more of everything.

Russia has more than 15,857 armored fighting vehicles, for example, to Ukraine's 3,309.

It has more than 10 times the aircraft -- 1,391 to Ukraine's 128, and 821 helicopters to Ukraine's 55, if you include Navy aircraft.

And where Russia has 49 submarines, Ukraine has none, according to IISS.

""There are big difference between the two forces -- Russia has a much more capable air domain, its air defenses are stronger,"" Michel said.

""There is a huge difference on helicopters and planes available at every level -- from transport aircraft to fighter aircraft to attack helicopters.""

Combat will

Ukrainian military vehicles move past Independence square in central Kyiv on Thursday.

Ukrainian forces have, however, launched some successful counterattacks.

Michel notes that the sheer combat will among Ukrainian troops to fight has been the armed forces' greatest strength.

""I'm really surprised at what I'm seeing. The fact that Ukrainian fighter jets are still flying, they actually took off is impressive.""

If Russia takes the capital soon, it will be difficult for Ukraine to fight back. But if it is unsuccessful, the conflict could become protracted. And that's the scenario where Ukraine's will may prove a powerful weapon, Michel said.

Modernization

But with fighting going on across the country, the number and quality of armory is a major factor.

Nick Reynolds, a Research Analyst for Land Warfare at the Royal United Services Institute, said that Ukraine's air force was now largely knocked out.

""There have been serious issues with modernization due to Ukraine's economic problems since 2014, so the military lacks modern air defense and artillery, particularly counter-battery artillery radar and other surveillance equipment to detect enemy artillery and at least stand some chance of suppressing it with their own,"" Reynolds told CNN.

""These capabilities are critical for Ukraine's army to be able to maneuver and resupply itself.""",https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/25/europe/russia-ukraine-military-comparison-intl/index.html

Russia Vs Ukraine Power Comparison

Russia launched an offensive targeting Ukraine’s military infrastructure and major cities from multiple directions, including air and missile attacks and ground forces. Ukraine was then forced to defend itself on numerous fronts, explaining that its thinness made their inferiority even worse.

Researchers have reported a malware attack that appeared to have been prepared for three months. The malware was used to wipe data on hundreds of computers, including Latvia and Lithuania. Additionally, cyber-attacks targeting Ukrainian government websites and affiliated organizations were launched by Russia.

When Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, Ukraine was unprepared for war. The Atlantic Council states that it lacked the workforce, equipment and training to defend against Russian aggression. Its logistics stockpiles were mostly Soviet-era goods, except for a few weapons. Ukraine has focused on modernizing its military in recent years, but decades of neglect have made the task difficult.

Russia Vs Ukraine Military Comparison

Defying the reunification of Crimea, NATO, and Russia have been at odds for a while. As a result, the region has been impacted adversely. Ukrainian authorities and Western nations claimed that Russian paramilitary units had occupied Ukrainian borders during the last month of the Ukrainian Revolution. Despite this, Russia insisted that these were self-defence troops and not military units. U.S. and European officials contend that this violates international law most flagrantly.

A threat to soldiers and their families has caused Ukraine to withdraw its forces. The Russian military has already taken control of 189 military bases in Crimea and deployed 10,000 troops in different locations. Approximately 80 Ukrainian soldiers were captured by Russian assault units near the Crimean port in Feodosia. Russian armoured personnel carriers have also entered the Novofederoskoe Military Base and Belbek Air Base. According to the Ukrainian army, several Russian assault boats, including two helicopters, three-speed ships, and a tugboat, have seized a Ukrainian naval vessel off the coast of Crimea.

Russian efforts to build the new Soviet Union are increasingly apparent. Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych fled to Russia and sought assistance from Russian leader Vladimir Putin to restore the legitimate government in his country. The Interim Ukrainian President Oleksandr Tuchynov believes that both nations will suffer from Russia’s aggression.

Nuclear Weapons of Ukraine

Although Ukraine does not possess nuclear weapons today, it did have approximately 5,000 nuclear weapons back in the day. Ukraine was once a part of the Soviet Union before 1991, explaining this situation. As a consequence of its dissolution, all the satellites and states that had been forcedly attached to the USSR received several warheads. The Soviet Union had owned them previously. Ukraine, however, received everything that belonged to the USSR after it became independent, including nuclear weapons. Due to this, Ukraine became the third largest nuclear weapon holder globally.

These weapons were disposed of relatively quickly in Ukraine. They then joined the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty three years later, in 1994. Russian forces moved and disassembled all of the warheads in 1996.

Nuclear Weapons of Russia

As far as researching, developing, and storing nuclear weapons, this is the second most crucial state. Russians could catch up with Americans later, but it wasn’t until 1949 that the USSR conducted its first nuclear test. Western Powers also found it surprising, as they believed that Russia would not be able to produce nuclear warheads until the 1950s or early 1960s. After the initial test was conducted, the number of warheads was increased immediately. In the 1980s, the Soviet Union was the most significant power in warhead storage. It stored nearly 40,000 weapons.

As a nation that conducted over 700 nuclear weapons tests, Russia is considered the second most important in nuclear weapons development. Like the United States, Russia now has 6490 warheads, which is hardly more than the United States. Similarly, there are 1600 deployed warheads compared to 1600 in the American case. In reality, the world’s largest bomb is the Russian-made giant bomb. The blast yield was 50 megatons of TNT, known as Tsar Bomba.",https://dmerharyana.org/russia-vs-ukraine-power/

Data from a recent report compares the military forces of the two countries and provides details on the Russian-backed separatist forces in Donetsk and Luhansk.

This isn’t Russia’s first military intervention in the European country, the International Institute for Strategic Studies wrote in its 2022 “Military Balance” report. Notably, since Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, “European states have turned a corner in terms of their defence spending,” the think tank wrote.

Back in December, the commander of Ukraine’s military intelligence service, Gen. Kyrylo O. Budanov, outlined a scenario in which a Russian invasion would begin with airstrikes and rocket attacks aimed at ammunition depots and trench-bound troops — foreshadowing the attack that came early Thursday morning.

Very quickly, he said, the Ukrainian military would be incapacitated, its leadership unable to coordinate a defense and supply the front. After that, he said, responsibility would fall to frontline commanders to carry on the fight alone.

“They will hold up as long as there are bullets,” General Budanov said in an interview. “They’ll be able to use what they have in their hands, but believe me, without delivery of reserves, there’s not an army in the world that can hold out.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/24/world/europe/ukraine-war-military.html

Ukraine forces are reportedly putting up strong resistance to invading Russian forces as they surround and bomb the capital Kyiv on Sunday.

According to United States military information, Russia now has at least 50 percent of its estimated 150,000-strong invasion force inside Ukraine.

Analysts interviewed suggested the Russian military may have been caught off-guard by the level of pushback by Ukrainian fighters, and more troops would likely enter the fray in the coming days.

“Russia is clearly facing setbacks that it did not expect. It’s taking casualties and Ukraine is taking prisoners, including some quite senior, at least one, possibly two, brigade commanders,” said Nigel Gould-Davies from the International Institute for Strategic Studies.

“So Russia will be motivated now to accelerate the forces that it brings to this conflict. So far, it’s been using about half of the forces it has mobilised and prepared for this so in numerical terms.

“It’s quite clear that Russia has a very significant advantage. But the really impressive aspect of Ukraine’s resistance so far is how strong and how wide it has been,” said Gould-Davis, a former United Kingdom ambassador to Belarus.

Tom Bullock, an open source intelligence analyst for intelligence information firm Janes, said Russian forces so far have not been able to capitalise on their vastly superior military advantage.

He said fighting has slowed around major cities after Russian troops and equipment stormed the country on Thursday.

“The trend we are seeing is that the Russians are incurring losses, they are losing equipment and definitely losing soldiers. But so are the Ukrainians. In some places such as the south it appears the losses are heavier on the Ukrainian side.

“It does appear as though the Russians were expecting less resistance from the Ukrainians when they entered. That clearly hasn’t been the case,” Bullock told Al Jazeera.

‘Lack of momentum’

Troops and equipment are making slow progress on Moscow’s original three-front thrust because of “very determined resistance”, an American defence official told reporters on condition of anonymity to discuss internal US assessments.

“We have indications that the Russians are increasingly frustrated by their lack of momentum over the last 24 hours, particularly in the north parts of Ukraine,” the official said.

Al Jazeera was not able to independently verify the claim.

Russia said its forces pursued their advance after claiming to have paused their assault on Ukraine following an order from President Vladimir Putin. The Russian president subsequently ordered the attack to resume after Kyiv ignored Moscow’s call for negotiations. A Ukrainian official denied Kyiv had rejected talks.

In Moscow on Saturday, the defence ministry said the Russian army had been ordered to broaden its offensive.

“Today all units were given orders to develop the advance from all directions in accordance with the operation’s plans,” Russian Army Spokesperson Igor Konashenkov announced.

Russia has so far not succeeded in fully taking any Ukrainian city, although its forces have been bearing down on Kyiv as well as Kharkiv, which lies close to the Russian border.

Russia has claimed control of southern urban centres, including Melitopol and Kherson, north of the annexed Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, but this has not been confirmed.

The conflict has been marked by radically different versions of events from both sides.

Ukraine’s health minister said on Saturday 198 civilians, including three children, have been killed so far by Russian forces.

Russia has not said how many of its soldiers have been killed in the invasion, which it calls a “special military operation”. Moscow has said its goal is to “de-Nazify” Ukraine.

Western sources agree days of fierce fighting looms for control of Kyiv with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has insisted on staying in the capital, in physical danger.

‘Repelling enemy attacks’

The bulk of the Russian troops reportedly remained 30km (18 miles) outside of Kyiv.

A defiant Zelenskyy said his forces were repelling Russian troops advancing on the capital.

“We have withstood and are successfully repelling enemy attacks. The fighting goes on,” Zelenskyy said in a video message from the streets of Kyiv posted on his social media.

“Our main goal is to end this bloodbath. The enemy is suffering heavy losses – hundreds of soldiers killed who crossed our border and entered our land. Unfortunately, we are also suffering losses. Ukrainians are courageously resisting the aggression,” said Zelenskyy.

The US and Western allies are still able to deliver arms into the country to bolster the Ukraine military, and Washington plans to send more in the coming days to help them fight both Russian armour on the ground and assaults from the air, the US official said.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced on Saturday that Washington will provide $350m in additional military equipment to Ukrainian forces.

Ukraine, a democratic nation of 44 million people, won independence from Moscow in 1991 and wants to join NATO and the EU – goals Russia opposes.

Putin has said the West failed to take seriously Russia’s security concerns about NATO. But he has also expressed scorn about Ukraine’s right to exist as an independent state.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/26/russian-forces-meeting-strong-and-wide-ukraine-resistance
