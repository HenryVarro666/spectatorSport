Moscow signalled on Friday it was scaling back its ambitions in Ukraine to focus on territory claimed by Russian-backed separatists in the East as Ukrainian forces went on the offensive to recapture towns outside the capital Kyiv.

In an announcement that appeared to indicate more limited goals, the Russian Defence Ministry said a first phase of its operation was mostly complete and it would now focus on the eastern Donbass region, which has pro-Russia separatist enclaves.

Facing stiff resistance, Russian troops have failed to capture any major city in the month since invading Ukraine. Instead, they have bombarded cities, laid waste to urban areas and driven a quarter of Ukraine's 44 million people from their homes.

Moscow calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Ukraine and its Western allies have dismissed this as a baseless pretext for an unprovoked war.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has again appealed to Russia to negotiate an end to the war, but says Ukraine would not agree to give up any of its territory for the sake of peace. In his video address to the nation, Zelenskyy appeared to be responding to Col. Gen Sergei Rudskoi, deputy chief of the Russian general staff, who said Russian forces would now focus on the main goal, the liberation of Donbas.

WARSAW, Poland — U.S. President Joe Biden has told Poland’s President Andrzej Duda that “your freedom is ours,” echoing of one of Poland’s unofficial mottos. He assured Duda that the U.S. and other NATO allies would come to their aid if Russia should attack.

The two gathered Saturday on Biden’s final day in Europe to speak about their shared effort to end the war in neighboring Ukraine.

Biden called the “collective defense” agreement of the Western military alliance a “sacred commitment,” and said that the unity of NATO was of the utmost importance. He also acknowledged that Poland was bearing the brunt of the humanitarian crisis, with more than 2 million of the 3.5 million people fleeing Ukraine entering the country. He said the other NATO allies must do more. The U.S. has pledged to accept up to 100,000 refugees.

Duda said that the relations between the two nations are flourishing, despite the difficult times.

BUCHAREST, Romania — NATO’s deputy secretary-general says that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s month-old “barbaric war” against Ukraine is one he cannot win.

Mircea Geoana said in an interview with The Associated Press that NATO would be “forced to take appropriate measures” in the event of a chemical or nuclear attack, which follows a string of ominous comments from Moscow officials who refuse to rule out their use. He declined to say what those measures would be.

“NATO is a defensive alliance, but also it’s a nuclear alliance,” he said. “If they will be using chemical weapons or other kinds of higher-end systems against Ukraine, this will be changing fundamentally the nature of the war that Mr. Putin has waged against Ukraine.”

“I can guarantee that NATO is ready to respond proportionately,” he added.

——

HELSINKI — Finland’s president says his country would likely be targeted by Russian cyber warfare and could face border violations if it decides to apply for membership in NATO.

Several polls in recent weeks have shown a majority of Finns now supporting NATO membership, up from 25% at most before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. President Sauli Niinisto said in an interview Saturday with public broadcaster YLE that the biggest benefit would be “gaining a preventive effect.”

But he pointed to a risk of disruptive behavior by Russia during an accession process, which would take at least months.

He said an application would lead to tensions at Finland’s 1,340-kilometre (830-mile) border with Russia, including the possibility of “robust” border and territorial violations — not just by Russian aircraft, as Finland has experienced in the past.

Niinisto said: “We don’t even know all the possiblities for hybid influencing that someone may invent. The entire world of information technology is vulnerable. Even some important society functions can be disrupted.”

Moscow has said it would consider European Union members Finland and neighboring Sweden joining NATO a hostile move that would have serious military and political repercussions.

MEDYKA, Poland — Refugees arriving in Poland from Ukraine are pleading for more help to end the war as U.S. President Joe Biden wraps up his four-day visit to Europe.

The U.S. has been sending money and supplies to aid the refugee effort. This week, Biden announced US$1 billion in additional aid and said the U.S. would accept up to 100,000 refugees.

Elena Taciy, a 50-year-old from Berdyansk, said that the U.S. support is “right and needed.” She said Saturday she wanted Biden “to come to Ukraine in person and see the situation with his own eyes.”

Maria Shevchenka, a 43-year-old from Mykolaiv, said that “we are waiting for them (the Americans) to help us end this crisis, so that finally we can return back to our country and our homes.”

Biden, who was in Warsaw on Saturday, dropped in on a meeting between U.S. and Ukrainian foreign policy and defense leaders.

LVIV, Ukraine — The governor of the Kyiv region says that Russian forces have entered the city of Slavutych and seized a hospital there.

Slavutych is located north of Kyiv and west of Chernihiv, outside the exclusion zone that was established around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant after the 1986 disaster. It is home to workers at the Chernobyl site.

Governor Oleksandr Pavlyuk said Saturday that the Russians also kidnapped the city’s mayor, but some media reported later in the day that the mayor was released swiftly. Neither claim could be verified independently .

The governor said that residents of Slavutych took to the streets with Ukrainian flags to protest the Russian invasion.

“The Russians opened fire into the air. They threw flash-bang grenades into the crowd. But the residents did not disperse, on the contrary, more of them showed up,” Pavlyuk said.

——

LVIV, Ukraine — Authorities in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, have announced a new 35-hour curfew in the city.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said the curfew will run from 8 p.m. local time on Saturday to 7 a.m. on Monday, with local residents allowed to leave their homes only to get to a bomb shelter.

Klitschko said that shops, pharmacies, gas stations and public transport will not be operating during the curfew.

ISTANBUL — Turkey’s defense ministry says a “mine-like” object has been “neutralized” at the northern entrance to the Bosporus Strait.

The sighting on Saturday of a possible naval mine followed warnings that mines laid at the entrances to Ukrainian ports could break free in bad weather and cross the Black Sea.

Broadcaster NTV showed images of an object bobbing in the waves off Istanbul’s Sariyer district, on the Bosporus’ European coast. A Coast Guard vessel was stationed nearby.

A Defense Ministry statement said divers were dispatched to deal with the object. According to Demiroren News Agency, it was noticed by fishermen.

On March 18, Turkey advised ships to keep a “sharp lookout” and report any possible mines that had drifted from Ukrainian ports.

Last year some 38,500 ships passed through the Bosporus, which links the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. Soon after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Ankara closed the strait to military vessels.

——

LONDON — Britain’s Defense Ministry says Russia continues to besiege a number of major Ukrainian cities including Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Mariupol.

A daily update says Russian forces are proving reluctant to engage in large scale urban infantry operations, rather preferring to rely on the indiscriminate use of air and artillery bombardments in an attempt to demoralize defending forces.

The assessment says it is likely Russia will continue to use its heavy firepower on urban areas as it looks to limit its own already considerable losses, at the cost of further civilian casualties.

——

DOHA, Qatar — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has made a surprise video appearance at Qatar’s Doha Forum.

Zelensky in his video address Saturday criticized Russia’s ongoing war on his nation. He called on the United Nations and world powers to come to his aid. He compared Russia’s destruction of the port city of Mariupol to the Syrian and Russian destruction wrought on the city of Aleppo in the Syrian war.

“They are destroying our ports,” Zelensky said. “The absence of exports from Ukraine will deal a blow to countries worldwide.”

He added: “The future of Europe rests with your efforts.” He called on countries to increase their exports of energy — something particularly important as Qatar is a world leader in the export of natural gas.

He criticized Russia for what he described as threatening the world with its nuclear weapons.

“Russia is deliberating bragging they can destroy with nuclear weapons, not only a certain country but the entire planet,” Zelensky said.

He also noted Muslims in Ukraine would have to fight during the upcoming holy fasting month of Ramadan.

“We have to ensure this sacred month of Ramadan is not overshadowed by the misery of people in Ukraine,” he said.

——

ISTANBUL — Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke to Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky by telephone, discussing the situation in Ukraine and negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv, Erdogan’s office said late Friday.

Erdogan told his counterpart that he had raised Turkey’s support for Ukrainian territorial integrity at a recent NATO summit, where he had relayed the diplomatic efforts made by Turkey in one-one-one meetings with other leaders, according to a statement from the Turkish presidency.

Ankara, which has close ties with both Russia and Ukraine, has positioned itself as a neutral party, seeking to facilitate negotiations between the warring sides.

——

Russian forces in Ukraine appear to have shifted their focus from a ground offensive aimed at Kyiv to instead prioritizing what Moscow calls the liberation of the contested Donbas region, suggesting a new phase of the war.

It appears too early to know whether this means President Vladimir Putin has scaled back his ambitions in Ukraine, but Russian military moves this week indicate a recognition of the surprisingly stout Ukrainian resistance. Russian-backed separatists have controlled part of the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine since 2014.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday again appealed to Russia to negotiate an end to the war, but he said Ukraine would not agree to give up any of its territory for the sake of peace.

Putin’s forces are under great strain in many parts of the country, and the United States and other countries are accelerating their transfer of arms and supplies to Ukraine. In recent days, U.S. officials have said they see evidence of Ukrainian defenders going on the offensive in a limited way in some areas.

Putting a positive face on it all, the deputy chief of the Russian general staff said his forces had largely achieved the “main objectives” of the first phase of what Moscow calls a “special military operation” in Ukraine.

——

LVIV, Ukraine — Even as the conflict rages, a vast apparatus is being built to gather and preserve evidence of potential war crimes.

Less than a month after Putin’s order to drop the first bombs on his neighbor, the United States declared that Russian forces were violating international laws of war that were written after World War II. But it remains far from clear who will be held accountable and how.

Possible war crimes that have been reported in Ukraine include destroying homes, firing on civilians as they evacuate through safe corridors, targeting hospitals, using indiscriminate weapons like cluster bombs in civilian areas, attacking nuclear power plants and intentionally blocking access to humanitarian aid or food and water.

But intention matters. Destroying a hospital alone is not evidence of a war crime. Prosecutors would have to show that the attack was intentional or at least reckless.

——

LVIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s chief of staff is calling on the West to create a new lend-lease program for Ukraine, referring to the World War II effort that sent U.S. supplies to the Soviet Union to help it fight Nazi Germany.

“We need a full lend lease,” Andriy Yermak said in an address late Friday. “Today Ukraine is the holy grail of Europe, and without exaggeration Ukraine is reviving those principles that gave life to current Western civilization.”

He said what Ukraine needs most is real-time intelligence and heavy weapons.

Yermak also repeated the Ukrainian president’s calls for help in closing the skies over Ukraine to stop Russian bombing and missile attacks. The West has refused to impose a no-fly zone for fear of widening the war.

He said options include supplying Ukraine with air defense systems or fighter jets, or creating an “air police force to protect civilian infrastructure.”

LVIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has again appealed to Russia to negotiate an end to the war, but says Ukraine would not agree to give up any of its territory for the sake of peace.

In his nightly video address to the nation Friday, Zelensky appeared to be responding to Col. Gen Sergei Rudskoi, deputy chief of the Russian general staff, who said Russian forces would now focus on “the main goal, the liberation of Donbas.”

Russian-backed separatists have controlled part of the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine since 2014, and Russian forces have been battling to seize more of the region from Ukraine, including the besieged city of Mariupol.

Rudskoi’s statement also was a suggestion that Russia may be backing away from trying to take Kyiv and other major cities where its offensive has stalled. Zelensky noted that Russian forces have lost thousands of troops but still haven’t been able to take Kyiv or Kharkiv, the second-largest city.

LVIV, Ukraine — The Associated Press has independently documented at least 34 assaults on Ukrainian medical facilities by Russian forces.

AP journalists in Ukraine have seen firsthand the deadly results of Russian strikes on civilian targets, including the final moments of children whose bodies were shredded by shrapnel and dozens of corpses heaped into mass graves.

AP journalists outside Ukraine have confirmed the details of other attacks by interviewing survivors and independently verifying war zone videos and photos posted online. The accounting is part of the War Crimes Watch Ukraine project, a broader effort by AP and PBS “Frontline.”

The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights confirms at least 1,035 civilians, including 90 children, have died and another 1,650 civilians have been wounded since the war started a month ago.

President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy: ""We must all stop Russia. The world must stop the war. I am grateful to everyone who works in support of Ukraine, in support of freedom. But the war continues. Terror against civilians continues. For a month! So long! It breaks the heart of mine, of all Ukrainians, and of every free person on earth. That is why I ask you to oppose the war!""

The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valerii Zaluzhnyi also addressed Ukrainians: ""Today we are all Victory soldiers. Military and civilian, Ukrainian citizens and legionnaires, diaspora Ukrainians and our foreign friends… Ukraine lives in our hearts. The power and stability of our state are us. All the power is in the people.""

The United States has officially recognized the actions of the Russian army in Ukraine as a war crime. This is stated in a statement by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, published on the website of the State Department. ""Today I can announce that based on the information we have, the US government believes that Russian troops have committed war crimes in Ukraine,"" Blinken said.

11:00 – Kyiv is negotiating security guarantees with the United States, Britain, Germany, France, and Turkey, said Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba.

The crimes of fascist Russia are carefully documented. Punishment will catch up with every Russian beast! During the month of Russia's military invasion of Ukraine, the occupiers killed 128 children. Seven children have died in the past 24 hours alone.

According to UNICEF, every second child in Ukraine since the war has been forced to leave their homes.

Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Russian occupiers have committed 148 crimes against journalists and the media. In particular, the Russian military killed five journalists and wounded seven others. One journalist went missing.

Remember the girl Varia who spent money on armor vest selling flowers? And here is a sequel of the story: with the help of volunteers, Varia bought a bulletproof vest and handed it to one of the defenders. And the iPhone she dreamed of and raised money for was given to her by Apple.fixit store.

14:00 – Zelenskyy addressed NATO: ""I don't blame NATO, I want to be clear here. You are not guilty; it's not your missiles and bombs destroying our cities. Today, by the way, there were phosphorus bombs that killed adults and children. I just want you to know that the Alliance can still prevent the deaths of Ukrainians from Russian strikes by providing us with all the weapons we need.""

The Verkhovna Rada voted in favor of Draft Law 7189, which provides for criminal liability for photo or video recording of the movement of Ukrainian troops. This law amends the Criminal and Criminal Procedure Codes of Ukraine.

Also, from now on, 10 to 12 years of imprisonment is envisaged for cooperation with the aggressor state. Collaborationists are prohibited from holding a number of positions in the future, for a period of 10 to 15 years with possible complete confiscation of property.

The first exchange of prisoners of war took place! ""In exchange for 10 captured occupiers, we pulled out 10 of our servicemen. Also, today we sent 11 Russian civilian sailors to the Russians, whom we rescued from a sunken ship near Odesa. As a result of this exchange, 19 Ukrainian civilian sailors are returning home from the Sapphire rescue ship, which was captured by the occupiers while trying to take our troops from Zmiinyi Island. Under the terms of the exchange, the lifeboat itself will also be returned to Ukraine and sent to a port in Turkey,"" Iryna Vereshchuk said.

Humanitarian corridors

Iryna Vereshchuk named ""green routes"" along which people will be evacuated today:

Mariupol – Zaporizhzhia

The Berdiansk-Zaporizhzhia route will be used to evacuate people from Mariupol. Meeting place: sports complex on Melitopolske Shosse, 27.

Polohy – Zaporizhzhia

Meeting place: city council.

Melitopol – Zaporizhzhia

Meeting place: fire department №9.

Velyka Dymerka – Brovary

Meeting place: The building of the village council on Bobrytska Street, 1.

Bohdanivka – Brovary

Meeting place: village council at Bohdana Khmelnytskoho Street, 219

Bervytsia – Brovary

Meeting place: from the village of Bervytsia, people have to cross the bridge between the villages of Mokrets and Zavorychi, where they cross the Trubezh river in the direction of Radhospna Street.

14:00 – Mariupol City Council reports: Russians are trying to misinform the people of Mariupol as if the evacuation to the territories controlled by the Ukrainian government is no longer carried out. The occupiers' car with a loudspeaker travels through the city and announces that Zaporizhzhia is no longer accepting refugees and they need to go to Russia and that Odesa has already been occupied. All this is occupiers' deliberate misinformation in order to turn the people of Mariupol against their own country. A request to all: spread the truth, write and call your family and friends in Mariupol.

Radiation and chemical threats

Forest fires are raging in the Exclusion Zone near the Chornobyl nuclear power plant, Ukraine has already reported this to the IAEA. At the moment, the occupiers don't allow firefighters into these areas.

UPD: As of this morning, most of the fires in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone have been localized, but there are still small areas where burning continues. Currently, there is no threat to human life and health.

Russia is preparing chemical attacks, said the Center for Combating Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council. The Russian Federation is now inciting hysteria over ""laboratories"" in Ukraine that allegedly create chemical weapons. This is how the propaganda media prepares the Russian population to use chemical weapons in order to have a ""cover"" and, if so, to use it themselves.

13:00 – A group of propagandists was brought to the Russian-occupied Chornobyl nuclear power plant to make a fake ""movie"" about the station's work. According to Energoatom, the invaders want to convince the IAEA of the ""normality"" of nuclear terrorism and hide the real state of affairs with radiation leaks and environmental pollution.

14:00 – Slavutych, a satellite city of the Chornobyl nuclear power plant, is in danger. The occupiers are trying to storm the city. The Ukrainian checkpoints are being shelled by the invaders. There is another threat of artillery fire.

20:00 – The United States will ""respond"" if Russia uses chemical weapons in Ukraine, said President Biden. Biden also called for the exclusion of Russia from the G20 and the inclusion of Ukraine in the format.

Who's coming to Ukraine?

About financial aid, weapons, and volunteer fighters

Britain will send another 6,000 weapons to Ukraine, including anti-tank missiles, according to the Prime Minister's Office.

The European Council has doubled funding for Ukraine under the European Peace Fund; military aid has increased by 500 million euros. This is stated in a statement on the website of the European Council. Thus, the amount of the initial budget allocated under the European Peace Fund has doubled and reached 1 billion euros. These funds will be used to purchase, in particular, personal protective equipment, first aid kits, fuel, military equipment, and lethal weapons of a defensive nature.

Ukraine received the first part of aid from the United States from a new $800 million package, a spokesperson for the presidential administration said in a comment to CNN. According to the official, the United States will continue to transfer the rest of the aid to Ukraine as soon as possible, given that, among other things, the aid includes 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems and 100 drones.

The ex-wife of Bezos, the founder of the online store Amazon.com and the aerospace company Blue Origin, donated money to the needs of Ukraine. American writer Mackenzie Scott (who returned her name after the divorce) made donations to 465 charitable foundations, amounting to $ 3,863,125,000 (almost $4 billion). Among them are funds related to Ukraine.

France will allocate 500 thousand euros to finance the International Criminal Court to support the investigation of crimes committed in Ukraine, CNN reports with reference to the French Foreign Ministry. France will also provide judges, investigators, and experts ""to make sure that the prosecutor can conduct his investigation in the best possible conditions.""

The United States is ready to accept 100,000 refugees from Ukraine and donate $1 billion to help European countries that have sheltered Ukrainians, the NYT reports.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealed to the North Atlantic Alliance to provide weapons to protect against Russian attacks. ""Over the decades, Russia has amassed considerable resources. Military resources, equipment, bombs, and missiles. They invested a lot of money in death while the world invested in life,"" he said.

And today Boris Johnson offered to give Ukraine Euro-2028. To recap, Russia declared that it would submit the application for carrying out the European championship of 2028. In response, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson offered to hold the championship in Ukraine.

News from abroad

The mayor of New York raised the Ukrainian flag in the city center. According to the city authorities, the flag will be there until Ukraine's victory in the war.

The UN Security Council has rejected a draft resolution proposed by Russia on the humanitarian catastrophe in Ukraine. The document, submitted by Russia, called for the protection of civilians and the provision of humanitarian aid. Only Russia and China voted in favor, while all other members of the Security Council abstained. Of course, the rapist country itself does not plead guilty to the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.

The Polish Sejm has officially recognized Putin as a war criminal. The Sejm also strongly condemned the acts of astonishing cruelty and outright genocide perpetrated by Russian fascist troops in Ukraine. The relevant resolution was adopted on March 23, PolskieRadio reports.

EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell said Russia was not yet interested in a ceasefire in Ukraine because its army hadn't achieved its military goals.

Russia, according to Borrell, wants to occupy the entire Ukrainian coast to the border with Moldova and isolate Ukraine from the sea. He noted that the situation regarding Russia's war against Ukraine would be resolved in the next 15 days. Meanwhile, the Allies will continue to provide military assistance to Kyiv, as it is important.

The Prime Minister of Estonia Kaja Kallas stated the need to consider options for how Ukraine will be able to receive reparations from Russia after the war to rebuild the destroyed infrastructure.

The Red Cross is asking Russia for permission to set up an office near Ukraine, namely in Rostov-on-Don, Russia. This is explained by the intention to ""improve their work"" in the territory of eastern Ukraine, which is controlled by the occupiers. Ukraine has already responded to this ""humanitarian initiative"": ""We are strongly opposed to the opening of the Red Cross office in Rostov-on-Don for allegedly more effective work in eastern Ukraine,"" said Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine Iryna Vereshchuk.

What's in Russia?

Russian zombies are not ashamed of the murders committed by their country. And we do not feel sorry for the occupiers.

Today began with a report that Russia expels American diplomats and declares American employees ""personas non grata.""

And yesterday, in Moscow, the activist was fined for the poster ""Fascism will not pass!"" According to the court, the poster expresses a negative attitude towards the armed forces of Russia.

Hackers of the Anonymous group hacked the Central Bank of Russia. Now they promise to release 35,000 files with secret agreements.

More than 20 Russian enterprises of the military-industrial complex (MIC) of the Russian Federation have completely or partially suspended their activities due to a lack of components and parts.

Due to their excessive losses in personnel and equipment, the Russian occupiers are trying to turn the war in Ukraine into a partially ""protracted phase."" The reason for such actions is the lack of any significant progress in all directions.

The Russian Federation proposed to oblige schoolchildren to pray for the glory of Russia every morning before lessons. However, no prayers will help prevent the imminent collapse of the rotten empire.

What about Belarus?

According to operative information, the Russian military leadership is transferring weapons and military equipment from military districts to the territory of Belarus and the temporarily occupied Autonomous Republic of Crimea. The goal is to make an attempt to prepare and implement offensive actions for the encirclement of the city of Kyiv. Also, units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to be involved in covering certain areas of the Belarusian-Ukrainian border.

19:30 – One and a half dozen Iskander missiles near Gomel were spotted in Belarus.

Moreover, a significant part of Belarusian citizens doesn't even want to be involved in the war. 67% of Belarusians oppose the shelling of Ukrainian territory from Belarus, and 52% of people, in general, oppose the use of their country's territory as a Russian springboard for war with Ukraine.

Russian lies

The Kadyrovites ""caught and neutralized Stepan Bandera."" The winning report was published with a photo of Butusov. The Ukrainian journalist himself is alive and well, fighting Russians on the real and information fronts.

Crimean impostor Aksyonov expects a record tourist flow to the Autonomous Republic of Crimea this year. But in fact, a record flow of 200 cargo and 300 cargo has already arrived.

Illiterate Russian orcs painted a new fake, explaining why Russia attacked Ukraine and why Russia is getting death notes. Now they say that Ukraine has made a medal for the ""Capture of Crimea."" But again, they received an F for their incompetent work:

Not capture, but release;

Not an order, but a decree;

Not Crimea, but the Autonomous Republic of Crimea;

Not V.A. Zelensky, and V.O. Zelenskyy

The quality of Photoshop is no comment.

Sanctions on the aggressor!

The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson said that Russian President Putin had crossed the line of barbarism. According to him, the West ""does not hesitate to go further in strengthening sanctions and providing further defense military assistance to Ukraine.""

Western Union has stopped conducting payments in Russia and Belarus

Almost at the same time, Apple banned the use of Russian Mir cards in Apple Pay.

TARS is no longer authorized to broadcast. Reuters is removing Russia's TARS propaganda resource from its content market due to biased coverage of the war in Ukraine.

Poland has blocked the bank accounts of the Russian embassy for financing terrorism.

Russia's largest charter airline is shutting down due to sanctions: Azur Air has operated flights from 40 cities in Russia to 29 international tourist destinations.

Switzerland has frozen Russia's assets by more than $6 billion.

And G7 leaders have agreed to review sanctions against Russia, Scholz said.

Life considering hostilities
