The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

How you can help: Here are ways those in the U.S. can help support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.

Russian-backed separatists in Donetsk say at least 16 people were killed after remnants of a Ukrainian missile landed on the city centre.

More than 160 civilian cars have been able to drive out of Mariupol after numerous failed attempts at evacuating residents from the besieged city.

The European Union has adopted a fourth package of sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.

The Take podcast: Is Russia’s Syria playbook being used in Ukraine?

What can 11 years of war in Syria tell us about Ukraine? This week marks the anniversary of Syria’s uprising and there still seems to be no end to conflict in sight.

There’s also another date that resonates: September 30, 2015, when Russia intervened on behalf of President Bashar al-Assad’s government.

Russia said it tested at least 320 new types of weapons in Syria, some of which are now in use in the war in Ukraine, and it is using tactics that seem to come from what has been called the “Syria playbook”.

We look at how the people all too familiar with that playbook see Syria’s story in Ukraine.

Ukraine’s economy could collapse if war drags on: IMF

The Russian invasion could plunge Ukraine into a devastating recession, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said.

The lender added that if the conflict is prolonged, the situation will worsen. Citing wartime data for conflicts in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen, it predicted the “annual output contraction could eventually be much higher, in the range of 25 to 35 percent.”

Russian troops focus efforts on capital Kyiv

Russian troops have refocused their efforts to seize Kyiv, firing artillery on suburbs, a local official said on Ukrainian television.

Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan, reporting from Kyiv, said residents in the capital were in for another nervous night, after the shelling of an apartment block in the early morning hours killed at least one person.

“A lot of the residents are very worried that that [attack] may have been an opening salvo for the war for control of the capital,” Khan said. “Military analysts are suggesting it may have been a way to keep pressure on the Ukrainians even as the talks were going on.”

Erdogan says unclear whether Turkey will buy more Russian arms

Turkey’s President Tayyip Erdogan has said it is too early to comment on Turkey’s possible purchase of more Russian weapons given Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

“Under the current circumstances, it would be premature to talk about what the future shows right now. We have to see what the conditions bring,” Erdogan said, speaking in Ankara alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

NATO member Turkey was handed US sanctions in December 2020 over its purchase of Russian S-400 missile defence systems and had been criticised by Western allies over the move. Ankara has said it was forced to opt for the Russian weapons because allies did not provide arms on satisfactory terms.

Land corridor ‘links’ annexed Crimea, separatist-held Donbass regions

The deputy head of the annexed peninsula of Crimea claims that a land corridor now links the area with the separatist Donbas region in eastern Ukraine.

Russian news agency RIA Novosti quoted Georgiy Muradov as saying that Russian forces had taken control of the road from Crimea to Mariupol.

There was no confirmation from Ukraine.

According to Muradov, this could help provide people in the Donetsk region with humanitarian supplies. At the same time, Kyiv said that Russian troops blocked a convoy with aid supplies for the besieged port of Mariupol in Donetsk.

Observers assume that one of the goals of Russia’s attack on Ukraine is to establish a land corridor from the separatist areas bordering Russia in eastern Ukraine to the Crimean Peninsula. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.

“Ukrainian troops are shooting in all directions”

Our correspondent Abdel-Azim Mohammad on the fighting between between Ukrainian and Russian forces in the eastern parts of Irpin – where thousands of civilians are trapped.

“We are in the heart of Irpin city, the front line where the Ukrainian army is engaged in fierce fighting with the Russians. We tried to advance towards downtown, but it seems that the Russians made it before us.

The Ukrainian troops are shooting in all directions, saying Russian snipers are stationed on rooftops to prevent the civilians from leaving the city. Dozens of residents were seen leaving from this area as well as the eastern side of Irpin.

The Ukrainians said they managed to fend off the Russians this morning. You can see the Ukrainian army’s forefront, they are trying to force the Russians back.

To my right, also fierce exchange of gunfire. It seems the Russians are advancing from more than one direction (natural sound… firing)… heavy machine guns and anti-craft guns are fired… (natural)…. (sky) they are firing into the air. It seems like a drone is hovering above… (natural)…. In this spot, and a few minutes before we arrived, dozens of civilian residents had left the city.

They claim the Russian forces granted them only a 15-minute window to leave the area before roads are closed. Many of the residents who were stranded in the eastern suburbs of Irpin managed to leave.

The Ukrainian troops are adamant to fight to force the Russians back since thousands of civilians are still trapped in northern and eastern parts of the city.”

Russia threatens Western companies with arrests, seizures: Report

Russian authorities, facing potential economic calamity as Western sanctions take hold, have threatened foreign companies hoping to withdraw from the country with arrests and asset seizures, the Wall Street Journal has reported.

Russian prosecutors have issued warnings to several foreign entities – via calls, letters and in-person visits – including to Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Procter & Gamble, IBM and Yum! Brands, the parent company of KFC and Pizza Hut, according to the business daily, citing sources familiar with the matter.

They have threatened to arrest officials who have criticised the government or to seize assets, including intellectual property.

“The warnings have prompted at least one of the targeted companies to limit communications between its Russian business and the rest of the company, out of concern that emails or text messages among colleagues may be intercepted, some of the people (familiar with the matter) said,” according to the Wall Street Journal.

US, China aides to meet amid tensions over Russia

The US and China are sending top aides to meet in Rome on Monday amid mounting tensions between the two countries over the Russia-Ukraine war, with the US saying Russia has asked China for military equipment to help press its campaign.

In advance of the talks, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan bluntly warned China to avoid helping Russia evade punishment from global sanctions that have hammered the Russian economy. “We will not allow that to go forward,” he said.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has put China in a delicate spot with two of its biggest trading partners: the US and the European Union. China needs access to those markets, yet it also has shown support for Moscow, joining with Russia in declaring a friendship with “no limits”.

Bermuda revokes licences for Russian-operated planes

Bermuda’s aviation regulator has said it is suspending certification of all Russian-operated aircraft registered in the British overseas territory due to international sanctions over the war in Ukraine, in a move expected to affect more than 700 planes.

The regulator said it was unable to confidently approve the planes as airworthy due to the effect of sanctions on its ability to conduct safety oversight.

Manufacturers are no longer providing parts to Russian airlines as part of the sanctions.

Russian default no longer ‘improbable’

Russia may default on its debts in the wake of unprecedented sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine, but that would not trigger a global financial crisis, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has said.

Georgieva told CBS’s “Face the Nation” programme that sanctions imposed by the United States and other democracies were already having a “severe” effect on the Russian economy and would trigger a deep recession there this year.

The sanctions were limiting Russia’s ability to access its resources and service its debts, which meant a default was no longer viewed as “improbable,” the IMF official said.

Asked if such a default could trigger a financial crisis around the world, she said, “For now, no.”

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has warned that residents of the besieged port city of Mariupol face a “worst-case scenario” unless Russia and Ukraine reach an agreement to ensure their immediate safety and access to humanitarian aid.

Ukrainian authorities say the city has been subject to relentless bombardment since Russian troops surrounded it on March 2. Read the full story here.

The US has information suggesting China has expressed some openness to providing Russia with requested military and financial assistance, a Western official and a US diplomat told CNN.

But it is not yet clear whether China intends to provide Russia with military or financial assistance as part of its war on Ukraine, US officials familiar with the intelligence tell CNN.

The consideration was detailed in a diplomatic cable relayed to allies in Europe and Asia, according to the sources.

The cable did not state definitively that assistance had been provided.

One official also stated the US warned in the cable that China would likely deny it was willing to provide assistance.

The Chinese Community Party leadership is not all in agreement regarding how to respond to Russia’s request for assistance, said one of the sources.

Two officials said that China’s desire to avoid economic consequences may limit its appetite to help Russia.

“There is real concern by some that their involvement could hurt economic relationships with the West, on which China relies,” added one of the sources.

Officials are also monitoring whether China provides some economic and diplomatic relief for Russia in other forms, like the abstention vote at the UN.

Chinese President Xi Jinping is “unsettled” by the Russian invasion of Ukraine in part because “his own intelligence doesn’t appear to have told him what was going to happen,” and because of how Vladimir Putin “has driven Americans and Europeans more closely together,” CIA Director Bill Burns told the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday.

Officials separately told CNN that Xi has been unnerved by how the war in Ukraine has reinvigorated the NATO alliance.

Chinese leadership is also concerned because of “the reputational damage that China suffers by association with the ugliness of Russia’s aggression in Ukraine” and “the economic consequences at a time when growth rates in China are lower than they’ve been in 30 years,” according to Burns.

The US is “watching very closely the extent to which” China or any other country “provides any form of support, whether that’s material support, whether that’s economic support, whether that’s financial support to Russia,” State Department spokesperson Ned Price stated.

“Any such support from anywhere in the world would be of great concern to us,” he added.

He declined to comment specifically on reports of a diplomatic cable that the US had sent to NATO allies about China’s willingness to support Russia’s war in Ukraine.

China and Russia have denied allegations that Moscow requested military assistance from Beijing.

UNHCR hails record $200 million in private sector donations for Ukraine

The United Nations refugee agency has said the private sector provided “record-breaking amounts” towards its efforts to support those displaced by the invasion of Ukraine.

“In just over two weeks, companies, foundations and philanthropists have contributed over $200 million towards UNHCR’s Ukraine emergency response,” it announced in a statement.

The agency estimates that more than 2.8 million people have been forced to flee Ukraine as refugees since February 24, while at least two million more have been displaced inside the country.

World Bank approves $200m in additional funding for Ukraine

The World Bank has announced an additional $200 million funding package for Ukraine, to bolster the country’s social services for vulnerable people, on top of the $723 million package approved last week amid the Russian invasion.

The financing is part of a $3 billion package the World Bank has prepared for Ukraine over the coming months.

David Malpass, the World Bank’s President, told a virtual event hosted by the Washington Post that the bank hoped to finalise the complete support package within six to eight weeks to help Ukraine cover its needs.

He said costs incurred in the eventual rebuilding effort – to repair infrastructure like roads and motorways – could amount “to tens of billions of dollars”.

He added: “The magnitudes are astronomical. Ukraine has been hit by the economic slowdown itself, the crops that are in the fields – difficult to harvest them. It’s a harsh and horrifying effort that’s going on almost day by day.”

“Our immediate focus right now … is how do we help the people that are under attack at the moment?” he continued.

ICJ to rule in Ukraine case against Russia on Wednesday

The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has announced it will rule in the case that Ukraine has brought against Russia on Wednesday.

In a hearing boycotted by Russia on March 7, Ukraine had asked the court to order Russia to cease military activities, arguing the invasion was based on a faulty interpretation of the UN genocide treaty.

Russian troops focus efforts on Kyiv

Russian troops have refocused their efforts to seize Kyiv, firing artillery on suburbs, a local official said on Ukrainian television.

The official also added a town councillor for Brovary, east of Kyiv, had been killed in fighting there and shells fell on the towns of Irpin, Bucha and Hostomel, which have seen some of the worst conflict during Russia’s stalled attempt to take the capital.

Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan, reporting from Kyiv, said residents in the capital were in for another nervous night, after the shelling of an apartment block in the early morning hours killed at least one person.

“A lot of the residents are very worried that that [attack] may have been an opening salvo for the war for control of the capital,” Khan continued, adding, “Military analysts are suggesting it may have been a way to keep pressure on the Ukrainians even as the talks were going on.”

Erdogan says unclear whether Turkey will buy more Russian arms

Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has said it was too early to comment on Turkey’s possible purchase of more Russian weapons given Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

“Under the current circumstances, it would be premature to talk about what the future shows, right now. We have to see what the conditions bring,” Erdogan said, speaking in Ankara alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

NATO member Turkey was handed US sanctions in December 2020 over its purchase of Russian S-400 missile defence systems and had been criticised by Western allies over the move. Ankara has said it was forced to opt for the Russian weapons because allies did not provide arms on satisfactory terms.

EU adopts fourth package of sanctions against Russia

The European Union has adopted new sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, with diplomats saying the oligarch Roman Abramovich was among the individuals listed.

The EU presidency, currently held by France, tweeted that the ambassadors of the bloc’s 27 member nations approved a fourth package of sanctions, hitting individuals and companies “implicated in the assault on Ukraine”.

Their names were to be made public in a “quick” publication of the EU’s Official Journal legally announcing all the European Union’s decisions, it said, adding that the sanctions were worked out in concert with Western partners.

Abramovich, the billionaire owner of the Chelsea football club, was added to the list of wealthy Russians whose assets in the EU can be seized and entry into the bloc refused, diplomats told AFP.

Ukraine working on obtaining some of seized assets of Russia

Ukraine is working on obtaining some of the seized assets of Russia, said the minister of finance, Sergei Marchenko, during an information telethon.

“I would not like to disclose details right now, but such work is under way. On sanctions, we also joined. We are working with leading investment banks. Already leading banks, in particular Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan and other banks have actually stopped operations in Russia, they are withdrawing from assets, and this is quite painful for the aggressor economy,” he added.

Anton Herashchenko, official adviser and a former deputy minister at Ukraine’s ministry of internal affairs, stated the total value of the seized assets was equivalent to $415bn (£319bn).

Mayor of Ukraine’s Kharkiv says Russian forces firing at city non-stop

The mayor of Ukraine’s front line city of Kharkiv has stated the city had been under constant attack by Russian forces, who have fired at central districts causing an unspecified number of casualties.

Mayor of Irpin says evacuation efforts are being hindered by Russian bombardment

The mayor of Irpin has said the city continues to suffer “heavy, heavy shelling and bombardment” that is hindering efforts to evacuate citizens.

Speaking to the BBC via a translator, Oleksandr Markushyn stated continuous Russian shelling is hitting schools, residential areas and private homes, as well as the city’s palace of culture, and is making evacuation efforts more difficult.

He added: “I was participating in the evacuation of a column of around 100 people; it was the only safe place where we could evacuate people fifty metres in front of me there was a family – two kids, a husband and wife – and they were killed by a mine.

“Unfortunately these things are happening all the time, they are shooting at peaceful civilians. We were taking people out in vehicles and buses – it’s not possible [allowed] to shoot civilians but they are doing that. This is barbaric, they are barbarous,” he continued.

Russian army to continue strikes against locations of foreign mercenaries in Ukraine

The Russian army knows the locations of foreign mercenaries in Ukraine and surgical strikes will be dealt against such facilities, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov told the media on Monday.

“We know all locations of foreign mercenaries in Ukraine. More surgical strikes will continue to be delivered against them, like the one carried out on March 13 against the training centers in Starichi and at the Yavorovsky proving ground,” Konashenkov said.

“Let me warn once again that the mercenaries will see no mercy wherever they may be in Ukraine’s territory,” he continued, adding, “Some Western countries have been encouraging their citizens at the government level to participate in combat operations in the capacity of mercenaries against Russian forces in Ukraine.”

“All responsibility for the death of this category of foreign nationals in Ukraine will rest squarely upon the leaders of their respective countries,” Konashenkov warned.

He stressed that the regime in Kiev continued to use terror tactics and the most destructive weapons against civilians and civilian infrastructure.

Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated on Monday Moscow’s special military operation in Ukraine is proceeding in accordance with the original plan and will be completed on time and in full.

“Russia has a sufficient potential for conducting the special military operation in Ukraine. The operation is proceeding in accordance with the original plan and will be completed on time and in full,” Peskov stressed.

Russia: Missile strike against Donetsk crime against humanity

Russia’s Foreign Ministry has condemned the recent shelling of the city of Donetsk by Ukrainian forces using a Tochka-U tactical ballistic missile, describing this act as a crime against humanity.

Russia envoy: Moscow registers cases of Kiev using phosphorus & cluster bombs

Moscow has data of phosphorus-filled ammunition and cluster bombs being used by the Ukrainian armed forces, Russian Ambassador to the United Nations Vassily Nebenzia said.

“We’ve also recorded broad scale use by the Kiev regime of phosphorus-filled ammunition – this is counter to the third protocol of the UN Convention dated 1980 – and cluster bombs being used by the Ukrainian army,” Nebenzia added.

Russia expects provocations with chemical substances in Ukraine and has information on 80 tonnes of ammonia brought to a town northwest of Kharkov overnight, he continued.

“According to the information of the Ministry of Defence of Russia, Ukrainian armed formations are actively preparing for provocations with the use of chemical substances in order to accuse Russia of reportedly using chemical weapons,” Nebenzia said, adding, “On the night of March 9, Ukrainian nationalists transported to Zolochiv to the northwest of Kharkov about 80 tons of ammonia. On the March 10, the Ukrainian media started to disseminate information about how to protect yourself from a chemical attack.”

He noted Ukrainian forces control the city of Irpin where an American journalist was shot and killed at a checkpoint.

Russia says it will attack Ukrainian arms factories

The Russian defence ministry has announced it is planning to attack Ukrainian arms factories in retaliation for what it said was a Ukrainian strike on the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk, and urged workers and local residents to stay away.

The defence ministry noted in a statement that Russia believed Ukraine had used cluster charges on a densely populated area of Donetsk.

Ukraine says Russians using airpower to destroy military and civilian infrastructure

In their latest update on the conflict, the Ukrainian armed forces said Russian forces have continued “conducting systematic combat operations using bomber aviation in order to destroy the military and civilian infrastructure of Ukraine.”

“The occupiers use high-powered ammunition and disordered strikes on civilians. Such actions are classified by the International Humanitarian Law as a war crime,” the armed forces added.

US: Ukrainian forces have “effectively struck” Russian logistics and sustainment capabilities

Ukrainian forces have “effectively struck Russian logistics and sustainment capabilities,” in the ongoing war in Ukraine, a senior US defense official told reporters on Monday.

The US has seen examples of Ukrainians targeting Russian sustainment and logistics capabilities in their strikes on the large Russian military convoy that is outside of Kyiv, the official said.

“The Ukrainians as I’ve said all along, they’ve been quite creative here, they’re not simply going after combat capability, tanks and armored vehicles, and shooting down aircraft, although they’re doing all that, they’re also deliberately trying to impede and prevent Russia’s ability to sustain themselves, that is true,” the official added.

“Almost all” of the Russian advances in Ukraine “remain stalled,” the official stated.

Russian forces moving on Kyiv, including the infamous convoy to the north, have not appreciably progressed over the weekend, the official continued, though the US does see Russia trying to “flow in forces behind the advance elements” moving to the north of Kyiv.

The airspace over Ukraine “remains contested,” the official said, adding, “We still maintain the airspace is contested, that the Russians have not achieved air superiority over all of Ukraine.”

Operator: Ukraine’s Chernobyl loses power again

Ukraine’s Chernobyl nuclear power station has once again lost its electricity supply, energy operator Ukrenergo has said.

The retired nuclear reactors lost power early last week but supply was restored Sunday.

Ukrenergo added the power line had been damaged again “before the power supply had been fully restored” and that one of its repair crews will be going into “occupied territory” again for more repairs.

Ukraine urges Russia’s ‘immediate’ expulsion from Council of Europe

Ukraine has demanded that Russia be immediately expelled from the Council of Europe (COE), saying it had no right to remain a member of the pan-European rights body after invading its neighbour.

“We urge you to take a decision on the immediate expulsion of Russia from the Council of Europe,” Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal told the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) in Strasbourg, eastern France, via video link.

The council’s executive body had suspended Russia from all its rights of representation a day after the invasion, but an expulsion would be unprecedented.

Ukrainian PM: World has ‘finally opened its eyes’ to Putin threat

Denys Shmyhal, the Ukrainian Prime Minister, said that Europe showed a “poor understanding” of the true threat of Vladimir Putin’s regime until Russian forces invaded Ukraine, despite displaying “numerous violations of international law and other human values”.

Speaking at an address to the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe, Shmyhal stated the world has “finally opened its eyes” to Putin’s capabilities and intentions after Europe “chose the road of pacifying the aggressor” for many years.

He accused Russian forces of “behaving like terrorists” in Ukraine and said the Kremlin is also forcing people in Crimea to serve in the armed forces.

He was standing in for President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was supposed to give the address but could not due to “urgent, unforeseen circumstances”.

NATO to hold extraordinary meeting on Ukraine

UN allocates additional $40 million to Ukraine

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has said the UN will allocate a further $40 million from its central emergency response fund to ramp up humanitarian assistance for Ukraine.

In an address to the Security Council, the UN chief stated millions of people in Ukraine were facing hunger and dwindling water supplies.

The UN refugee agency estimates 2.8 million people have left Ukraine.

“They need help and support every step of the way,” Guterres continued.

Guterres stated that Russia’s decision to raise its alert level for its nuclear forces was a “bone-chilling development” in the war in Ukraine, and warned that the threat of nuclear conflict was back within the realm of possibility.

Russia says West trying to push it into default

Russia accused the West on Monday of seeking to push it into an “artificial default” through unprecedented sanctions over Ukraine, but vowed to meet its debt payments.

Russia is due to make an interest payment on its external debt later this week and Moscow warned it will be doing so in rubles if sanctions prevent it from using the currency of issue.

“The freezing of foreign currency accounts of the Bank of Russia and of the Russian government can be regarded as the desire of a number of foreign countries to organise an artificial default that has no real economic grounds,” Finance Minister Anton Siluanov announced in a statement.

Ratings agency Fitch last week downgraded Russia’s sovereign debt rating deeper into junk territory, warning that the decision reflects the view that a default is “imminent”.

Japan PM: Response to Russia could shape new era

The Russian invasion of Ukraine may have ushered in a new era, Japan’s Prime Minister has noted.

“Whether the world can respond resolutely to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and protect the core of the international order is a litmus test to foresee the era that follows the post-Cold War period.” Fumio Kishida stated.

People beginning to escape from Mariupol through evacuation corridor

An adviser to the mayor’s office in the city of Mariupol says that civilians are at last able to get out of the city through an evacuation corridor — and head towards the city of Zaporizhzhia, which is under Ukrainian control.

The official, Petro Andriushchenko, said that as of 1 p.m. local time (7 a.m. ET) “we have confirmation of the ceasefire regime” on an evacuation corridor for “private transport along the route: Mariupol – Melekine – Portovske – Mangush – Berdiansk – Zaporizhzhia.”

Berdiansk is under Russian control.

“As of now, more than 50 private cars have already passed Berdiansk and are moving towards Zaporizhzhia,” the official added.

Andruishchenko cautioned: “As of now, there are no difficulties in passing checkpoints” but “we cannot officially guarantee security on this corridor. But this is the only corridor that has official approval and that actually works today.”

Mariupol has a population of some 400,000. It’s not known how many people left ahead of the Russian invasion and encirclement of the city.

“My visit to Moscow is taking place at a very difficult time for the entire world. Surely, during today’s talks I expect to discuss the events that are taking place in Ukraine. We hope that peaceful solutions to this conflict will be found in the near future,” Al Thani stated.

“Qatar intends to make every possible effort to find diplomatic solutions and find a peaceful solution to the events taking place in Ukraine as soon as possible,” he added.

According to Al Thani, Qatar also expects to discuss “other issues concerning the region.”

Lavrov said Russia and Qatar will maintain contact on the situation in Ukraine.

“I believe that we both found the conversation useful and agreed to maintain contact on the issue. I would like to reiterate that we appreciate Qatar’s willingness to contribute to efforts to achieve the desired results,” Lavrov pointed out.

“We also appreciate the fact that Qatar seeks to make the most of its opportunities to facilitate agreements on the issues on the agenda based on the interests of common European security, including Ukraine’s security and Russia’s security and the need to make sure that no threats come from Ukraine to Russia,” Lavrov noted.

He stressed that there should be no threats to those seeking to protect the Russian language, Russian culture and traditions, including religious ones, “as well as to those who wish to live in the country without having to face any kind of discrimination, particularly discrimination stemming from neo-Nazi sentiment.”

Top Putin ally says Ukraine war has been slower than expected

One of Vladimir Putin’s closest allies stated Russia’s military operation in Ukraine had not gone as quickly as the Kremlin had wanted, the strongest public acknowledgement yet from Moscow that things were not going to plan.

National Guard chief Viktor Zolotov, speaking at a church service led by Orthodox Patriarch Kirill on Sunday, blamed the slower than expected progress on what he said were far-right Ukrainian forces hiding behind civilians, an accusation repeatedly made by officials in Russia.

His comments appeared at odds with an assessment made on Friday by Russia’s Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu who told Putin that “everything is going according to plan”.

“I would like to say that yes, not everything is going as fast as we would like,” Zolotov, once in charge of Putin’s personal security, noted in comments posted on the National Guard’s website.

“But we are going towards our goal step by step and victory will be for us, and this icon will protect the Russian army and accelerate our victory,” he added.

EU warns NATO’s entry into conflict over Ukraine could trigger World War III

NATO’s entry into the conflict over Ukraine could spark the World War III, European Council President Charles Michel said in an interview with the Spanish newspaper El Pais on Monday.

“We are doing our utmost not to exacerbate the conflict. Russia is a nuclear power, and we are well aware that if this conflict turns into a [conflict] of NATO against Russia, then we will get World War III,” Michel said.

“I am in constant contact with [Ukraine’s President] Vladimir Zelensky,” Michel specified.

“It’s true that he wanted more. But [EU] enlargement is a sensitive issue on which not all European countries have the same opinion,” he added.

“We should also take into account the countries with which the accession process has already begun. We must support our partners who are looking to the free world. The [EU] Association Agreements have a huge potential, which is underestimated,” the head of the European Council stressed.

Talks between Russia and Ukraine have started and communication between the two sides is hard but ongoing, Podolyak said on Twitter.

Tweeting a photo of the talks, which are being conducted via video conference, Podolyak added, “The parties actively express their specified positions. Communication is being held yet it’s hard. The reason for the discord is too different political systems.”

“China’s position on the Ukraine issue is consistent and clear, and we have been playing a constructive role in promoting peace talks.

Russia: Sending UN peacekeepers to Ukraine not on agenda of UN Security Council

Sending UN peacekeepers to Ukraine is not on the agenda of the UN Security Council or other international platforms, Pyotr Ilyichev, the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry’s international organizations department, told Sputnik.

“This issue is not yet on the agenda of the UN Security Council or any other international platforms,” Ilyichev said.

Moscow sees no grounds for such a decision, given that “the situation is fully controlled by the Russian armed forces in accordance with the goals and objectives of the special military operation,” the diplomat added.

“The further course of the settlement of the situation will depend on the willingness of the Ukrainian side to seek compromises. Thus, the current state of affairs does not provide for any involvement of the peacekeeping contingent of the world organization,” he continued.

Ukrainian president warns “it is only a matter of time before Russian missiles fall” on NATO territory

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned it is only a matter of time before Russia’s military assault on Ukraine expands to members of NATO unless the alliance installs a no-fly zone over his country.

“Last year, I made a clear warning to NATO leaders that if there were no tough preventive sanctions against Russia, it would start a war,” Zelensky said in a video address Sunday posted to his Facebook page.

Satellite image shows Ukrainians thwart Russian attempt toward Kyiv on pontoon bridge

The Ukrainian military has thwarted an attempt by Russian military vehicles to cross the Irpin River on a pontoon bridge near Hostomel, a new satellite image from Maxar Technologies shows.

The bridge first appeared in satellite imagery from Maxar on Thursday, March 10, and in that photo, it appears to have been destroyed. An additional photo, published on social media on March 13, also shows the pontoon bridge destroyed, in addition to nearby Russian military vehicles.

Ukrainian forces in Kyiv’s suburb of Irpin have so far repelled Russian advances toward the Ukrainian capital city. With the main bridge crossing the Irpin River having been destroyed by Ukrainians to thwart a Russian advance, the Irpin River poses a significant obstacle for the Russian military.

The pontoon bridge was located in an open field roughly five miles (eight kilometers) north of the main bridge across the Irpin River.

It’s the second known location where the Russians have built a pontoon bridge to move vehicles. Before the invasion began, Russia constructed a pontoon bridge across the Pripyat River in the greater Chernobyl exclusion zone and later moved dozens of forces across it.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has expressed concern over the safety of the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP), despite news of the resumption of external electricity supplies following the reparation of a damaged power line.

“This is a positive development as the Chornobyl NPP has had to rely on emergency diesel generators for several days now,” IAEA Director General Grossi said.

“However, I remain gravely concerned about safety and security at Chornobyl and Ukraine’s other nuclear facilities,” he added.

The plant is working on back-up diesel generators and will be reconnected to the Ukrainian electricity grid in the morning on Monday, according to IAEA.

The UN nuclear watchdog also announced staff operating radioactive waste facilities at Chernobyl had stopped carrying out safety-related repairs due to exhaustion, since they have not been relieved since Russia seized the site last month.

U.S. President Joe #Biden keeps finding other things (#Ukraine, #Russia, Iran, North Korea, domestic issues) get in the way of his big priority - dealing with #China [_link] via @bpolitics — Rosalind Mathieson (@RosMathieson) January 19, 2022

Previous administrations after the Allied Forces defeated the German-Japan Axis in 1945, put in a policy of containment versus the Soviet Union and the CCCP. Later it moved to a policy of coexistence until the implosion of the Soviet Union in 1989-90. Unfortunately the top dogs in the West and East are elderly men rusted in old ways and thinking. US Congress plays a aggressive legislative role in setting foreign policy which eats away at Executive Power of the President. To mob up any dissent, powerful lobby groups pour money into the campaigns of senators and representatives. In fact, not new ideas but narrow capital interests determine the course of history of the United States.

The Tehran Conference, 1943 At Tehran, Roosevelt outlined for Stalin his vision of the proposed organization in which the future United Nations would be dominated by ""four policemen"" (the United States, Britain, China, and Soviet Union) who ""would have the power to deal immediately with any threat to the peace and any sudden emergency which requires action."" Italics Finally, the three leaders issued a ""Declaration of the Three Powers Regarding Iran."" Within it, they thanked the Iranian Government for its assistance in the war against Germany and promised to provide it with economic assistance both during and after the war. Most importantly, the U.S., British, and Soviet Governments stated that they all shared a ""desire for the maintenance of the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Iran.""

Churchill's secret papers released

Operation Unthinkable - Churchill's plans to invade the Soviet Union in 1945 If you thought the Cold War between East and West reached its peak in the 1950s and 1960s, then think again. 1945 was the year when Europe was the crucible for a Third World War. So concerned was the Prime Minister Winston Churchill, that in the spring of that year he ordered his Chiefs of Staff to prepare a plan, `Operation Unthinkable' to attack the Soviet Empire. The top secret plan was so sensitive that only Churchill's immediate circle of military advisors were privy to the blueprint. The detailed proposal, which may seem fanciful today, sought to claw back East Germany and Poland, which had fallen under Soviet domination. Churchill felt particularly guilty over the fate of the Poles, who had fought valiantly for the Allies during the war but whose future was now dictated by Stalin. If Churchill wanted to act, he knew that time was running out. The United States were about to move vast numbers of their troops and ordnance out to the Far East for the assault on mainland Japan, leaving Western Europe at the mercy of Stalin. Furthermore, demobilisation would start after VE Day and would rapidly reduce the size of the British Army and their capacity for offensive action. The plan called for a massive Allied assault on 1 July 1945 by British, American, Polish and German - yes German - forces against the Red Army. They aimed to push them back out of Soviet-occupied East Germany and Poland, give Stalin and bloody nose, and force him to re-consider his domination of East Europe.

Mearsheimer and McGovern agree

This was true when FDR connived to enter WWII and ""discovered"" kamikazi fighters. It was true for the host of ignorant ""statesmen"" who inherited his state department and antagonized communist Korea, communist Han, Viet Cong, ""raghead"" sheiks and ""islamist"" suicide bombers, and independent states of Africa and India.

Putin’s end game is not just reducing Ukraine to rubble, as Bloomberg suggests, It is also a genocidal attack on vulnerable civilians. Attacks on hospitals, nursing homes and kindergartens is a deliberate effort to destroy the nation and a war crime. Vulnerable Ukrainians have become a primary and immoral target for the fascist in a Moscow bunker while maternity hospitals are razed to rubble and thousands of Ukrainians surrounded in cities shelter in underground stations to avoid Russian cluster bombs and rockets. There is no other message from this attack on Ukraine. It is important that the world recognises this for what it is and defends Ukrainians against what is an impending genocide, There is no rational reason to call this anything else or excuse this genocide for any humanly acceptable reason.

Ukrainian authorities have claimed the city Volnovakha now no longer exists and Putin is carrying out a “war of annihilation”. Russian-backed separatists claimed on Friday that they had captured the city. After days of heavy bombardment from the air and ground artillery units, the city has been demolished. Attacks on Crimean Tartars, the indigenous people of Crimea. At 6am on Thursday, a group of seven Russian soldiers raided Leila Ibragimova’s home in Melitopol in southeastern Ukraine. Ibragimova, an ethnic Crimean Tatar, is a well-known figure in the city, which has fallen under the control of the Russian army following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. A deputy of Zaporizhzhia Regional Council and director of the Melitopol Municipal Museum, she has been a strong advocate for her constituency, including the local population of about 12,000 Crimean Tatars – a Muslim group indigenous to nearby Crimea, a territory Russia annexed in 2014.

They asked her about Azad, a local Crimean Tatar organisation, as well as the names and addresses of activists and opinion leaders in her area. Ibragimova refused to give the men any information and told them their actions were illegal. This is still Ukraine, she said, and Russian law does not apply. Ibragimova was released later that day and the Russian occupying forces decided not to press any charges against her. However, analysts say the arrest may give insights into Russia’s long-term plans when it comes to the territories it took control of in the past two weeks, and tactics it may use to achieve them. “The goal of the detention was to threaten Ibragimova, get the most information about her contacts, and identify people and organisations that Russian forces should target next. These are well-known methods of Russian security services. They have done the same in Crimea since 2014,” Nedim Useinow, a political scientist at the faculty of European Islam, University of Warsaw, told Al Jazeera. Useinow said Russia’s plan appears to seize territory enabling it to permanently cut off Ukraine’s access to the sea and connect breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk with the Russian mainland and Crimea. “They also want to secure access to water from Dnipro River because they still haven’t solved the problem of water scarcity in Crimea,” he said. “They have also begun to bring some Crimean Tatar collaborators over to organise agitation in the Kherson region.” Persecution of activists A closer look at Russia’s policies in the annexed Crimea towards Tatars may provide an indication of what can happen with activists, officials and community leaders in other southern Ukrainian territories that have recently fallen under Russian control, analysts say. “The situation of Crimean Tatars in Crimea has been hard since the beginning of the occupation. Russia has been persecuting all activists who are against the occupation and organised purges,” Lenur Kerymov from the Polish Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights told Al Jazeera. “Until now, around 20 people have been disappeared in Crimea. They were abducted by the security services and they are most likely dead. It has hugely influenced the morale of the people. Russia’s policy towards Crimean Tatars is that of terror.” Analysts say that while repression of Crimean Tatars is partly due to religion, it is also because many in the community have protested against the Russian annexation and criticised it in the media. Over the past eight years of Russian presence in Crimea, activists’ homes have been searched, almost all independent Crimean Tatar media outlets were closed and local journalists were either forced to leave or change their focus from politics to entertainment. There is full censorship of local media. The politics of Russification have also been in full force. While on paper Crimea has three official languages, namely Russian, Crimean Tatar and Ukrainian, local activists and experts say that schools are discouraged from teaching in Crimean Tatar and Ukrainian. Kerymov says the policies aim to remove all the traces of Tatar identity and culture and thwart any civil movements. “There are over 100 Crimean Tatars that we consider prisoners of conscience in Russian prisons with long prison sentences. The majority of these people are religious Muslims,” Kerymov said. “Russians claim that they are members of Hizb-ut-Tahrir [an Islamic political party], which is banned in Russia. In Ukraine the party is legal and there is no evidence that any of their members in Ukraine or Crimea were connected to any criminal activities, terrorism or extremism. These are simply people who believe differently.” In some cases, people were imprisoned for merely possessing a Quran, Kerymov says. Kerymov’s predictions on what might happen next in the newly occupied territories of Ukraine are far from optimistic. “All activists and people who could lead mass protests will be threatened, there will be imprisonments. I hope that there will be no killings but we have to prepare for that, too,” he said. “These are typical methods Russia uses to punish and threaten local populations.” Crimean Tatars are the indigenous people of Crimea. They have been subject to persecution, murder, and imprisonment in the lead-up to and the occupation of Crimea by Putin. According to the Crimean Tatar Resource Center, there are currently 169 Crimean Tatar political prisoners being held in Crimea by the Russian occupiers. Crimean Tatars are by far the largest group of the 238 political prisoners held in Crimea. Putin’s treatment of the Crimean Tatars recalls Stalin’s genocidal actions towards the ethnic minority. The Ukrainian Parliament adopted a law in 2021 on Indigenous peoples. The bill, initiated by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, recognized Crimean Tatars, Karaites, and Krymchaks as “Indigenous peoples of Ukraine.” Isa Akayev was among the Crimean Tatars who escaped the occupation of Crimea and settled in Vinnytsia, Ukraine. “One of our activists was evacuating his family and his car broke down in Vinnytsia. This is how he happened to stay there”. Isa immediately signed up to fight in East Ukraine. “I realized that the sooner the war in the east ends, the sooner we would return to Crimea,” The Crimean Tatars have now organized a volunteer battalion commanded by Isa Akaev to fight the Russian invaders. He says there is enough land in Ukraine to bury all invaders — and don’t forget to put seeds in the pocket so sunflowers grow. The same message the Ukrainian woman gave to a Russian soldier when she offered him sunflower seeds to put in his pocket. Not only are Ukrainian Muslims joining the fight. There are also Chechens, Syrians, and Azerbaijanis (many of whom have been victims of Russian war crimes and terror) volunteering. According to the Odessa Journal, a Russian landing on a beach near Odessa was aborted because marine conscripts from Crimea refused to fight. The Russians asked to be allowed to retreat without being shelled. Ukraine could serve as an example of multiethnic unity and religious tolerance in the region of the Black Sea and the North Caucasus. The tip of the spear in the fight against the White Supremacist Fascism of Putin and his gang of thugs. Слава Україні! (Glory to Ukraine) The Malaysian airliner MH17 was a deliberate execution plan by Russia in an effort to discredit the Ukrainian Airforce and to blame the country for the tragedy. This immoral act is now being pursued in courts by Australia who lost 38 nationals and by the Netherlands.

Russian Brain Drain March 14, 2022

Yevgeny Lyamin in Tbilisi Georgia Outside Georgia’s parliament, Yevgeny Lyamin heaves boxes of clothes and food parcels on to a waiting truck bound for Ukraine.

He is one of more than 25,000 Russians to have arrived in Georgia since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russians have been struggling to find affordable accommodation in all the major cities. Many can be seen wandering around the capital, Tbilisi, with their suitcases and often even their pets.

A blue-and-yellow ribbon is attached to the lapel of Yevgeny’s trench-coat – the colours of the Ukrainian flag. It was these ribbons that got him arrested at an anti-war protest in Russia, a day after it launched its war on Ukraine. “I understood the best way to act against Putin’s regime would be my emigration from Russia,” says the 23-year old politics graduate. “It’s my responsibility to do anything I can to help the Ukrainians.” The exodus does not stop at Georgia. The EU, US, UK and Canada have closed their airspace to Russian flights, so they are heading for countries where flights are still permitted and where visas are not required, such as Turkey, Central Asia and the South Caucasus. Many have fled to Armenia. According to one estimate by a Russian economist, as many as 200,000 Russians have left their country since the start of the war. Belarusians are on the move too, fleeing repression and the Western sanctions imposed on authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko’s government for collaborating with Russia’s Vladimir Putin. That has prompted prices to surge on last-minute flights and rental accommodation in the main host cities, such as Istanbul and Armenia’s capital, Yerevan. “A one-way flight to Istanbul cost me and my husband more than our combined monthly income,” said Anya, who did not want to give her surname. For her the moment of decision came with a new “state betrayal” law that has come into force in Russia. Anyone expressing support for Ukraine could face jail sentences of up to 20 years and Anya believed she could be a target. “Fear of closed borders, political repression and forced military service is in our DNA. I remember my grandmother telling me stories about the state of fear they lived in during Stalin’s time, and now we are experiencing it,” she said. Many of the new emigres are tech industry professionals who can work remotely. A video games developer I met at a cafe in Tbilisi told me that he and most people he knew disagreed with Russian policy and they knew now that any protest would be violently suppressed. “The only way we can protest is to leave the country, take our skills and money with us. Almost everyone in our circle has made a similar decision,” said Igor (not his real name). He plans to leave the Georgian capital, because he does not feel welcome here. There have been numerous reports of Airbnb hosts refusing to let their properties to Russian and Belarusian citizens. “I do not accept Russian and Belarus people” one host told a Belarusian couple, who shared their exchange with the BBC. “You do not have time for vacations – revolt against your corrupt governments.” “They think we are running away from Russia because Apple Pay no longer works there,” Igor complained. “We are not running for comfort, we’ve lost everything there, we are basically refugees. Putin’s geopolitics has destroyed our lives.” At Tbilisi’s public service hall, new arrivals are registering businesses or applying for residency. Kristina and Nikita, who are both IT specialists from the Belarusian capital Minsk, have registered as sole entrepreneurs. That will allow them to open Georgian bank accounts. “We don’t support our governments, which is obvious because we ran away. We want to be safe here,” said Kristina. “But we are being bullied just because of our nationality, I need to hide my country of origin, I don’t feel comfortable when people ask me where I am from.” Since the start of the war Tbilisi has seen some of the largest rallies in support of Ukraine. A recent survey found that 87% of Georgians view the war in Ukraine as their own war with Russia. But many Georgians are uneasy about this dramatic influx of Russians, as it is less than 14 years since Russia’s leader invaded Georgia. Some fear President Putin might claim Russian citizens abroad need protection, because that was his excuse to justify sending troops into the breakaway Georgian region of South Ossetia in 2008. To date, 20% of Georgian territory remains under Russian occupation. However, tech entrepreneur Lev Kalashnikov thinks Georgia will benefit from what he asserts is the biggest brain drain in Russia’s modern history. He opened a group for expats on the Telegram messaging app while standing in a queue. “There were 50 people in front of me and 50 people behind me. They became my first subscribers and now we have nearly 4,000 members.” Members discuss where to find accommodation, how to open bank accounts, and whether or not it is safe to speak Russian in public. Yevgeny Lyamin is already learning Georgian, practising Georgia’s unique alphabet in an exercise book. “I am against Putin, I am against war. I still can’t withdraw money from my Russian bank account, but that’s nothing like the problems that Ukrainians face.”

A Bleak Prognosis of Ukrainian War Insights: from a person working in Ukraine with the Ukrainian Ministry of Infrastructure March 13, 2022

This article is based on a private email from a friend who has a friend who has worked for the Ukrainian Ministry of Infrastructure in Ukraine recently and has returned to Australia because of the political invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Army. It summarises his/her understanding of the current situation and its implications for the Ukrainian nation. It is information designed to be shared. The opinions are Alex’s own based on his time in Ukraine and cannot be verified currently. But they are of use in adding to analysis of the current situation and possible future scenarios. The situation is fluid and changing rapidly. Will attempt to update this blog if its status changes because of future informational updates. Editorial Commentary “Nice to be back in rainy Sydney after two weeks in the US.

Let me share some impressions from talking to people in Ukraine over the last few days, following Ukrainian media and also listening to various Russian independent channels still operating on YouTube, and in particular, to the Russian military vloggers. The military vloggers are an interesting breed: they are typically former military officers who are obviously Russian patriots but who have for a number of years been documenting the corruption and the degradation of the Russian army—obviously in the hope of overcoming it. I have been following them for a while and to my infinite regret thought they were alarmist: one of them, a former military intelligence officer (the vlog, in Russian, is called “General of SVR”), who predicted an imminent full scale invasion in early January. One further aside before summarising my impressions: the Ukrainian media puts the ABC to shame in terms of how well-informed their journalists are and the smart and tough questions they ask of the government. Last night I watched an interview on one of Ukraine’s channels with the military advisor to Zelensky, who was giving a somewhat over-optimistic picture of the Ukrainian military success. The journalists kept demanding explanations and citing facts to him. The discussion was informed, intelligent, interesting and in the end left the viewers with a sense of realism.

Overall, the consensus in the Ukrainian media and among the Russian vloggers is that the dynamic phase of the conflict will continue for about another week to 10 days, after which the situation will settle to a static line of conflict with localised attacks. There are a number of risk elements over the next few days, in particular Odesa. However, there is general view that Odesa is unlikely to fall as Ukrainians are moving a lot of reserves there, and so the static line of conflict is likely to involve Russians holding a narrow land corridor from Crimea to the Donetsk and Luhansk republics along the coast, some land around Sumy and Zaporizhie, and possibly Kharkiv, although the defence of Kharkiv is generally going well (which is why Russians are now carpet bombing the civilian areas there). Of course the sad irony is that the two cities taking the brunt of attacks on the civilian population are Kharkiv and Mariupol, where more than half of the population are ethnic Russians. Kyiv bombardment has now largely been stopped, and our friends in Kyiv are saying that they are generally able to return to their apartments and the shops are being re-supplied again. A couple of hours ago there were reports that the Ukrainian army is fully in control of Mykolaiv and now pushing towards Kherson.

Of course Russia has a lot of resources and there will no doubt be tactical set-backs for Ukraine, but overall, I am not hearing any knowledgeable voices who think that Russia will be able to achieve any of its strategic objectives militarily. The best confirmation of that is the behaviour of Lukashenko. In the first four days of the war, he was making belligerent speeches and promising to send Belorussian troops to join the Russian army in Ukraine. Over the last few days, he was making daily announcements about how under no circumstances will Belorussian troops be involved. While he is no doubt afraid of Putin and knows that his survival depends on Russia, he is very good at reading the room and knowing which side to take.

The insights from the Ukrainian and Russian observers can be summarised as follows:

Intelligence : At the start of the war, there was a lot of concern that Ukraine was permeated by the Russian intelligence operatives and that there were a lot of pro-Russian elements within Ukraine who may undermine defence. In fact, it appears to be almost the other way around. There is clear evidence that there are strong elements within the Russian intelligence apparatus who support Ukraine. The evidence generally cited includes: (i) that on the first morning of the war, when Russians sought to achieve a shock and awe effect of destroying key Ukrainian military installations and command and control centres, all sensitive equipment and troops were removed from the areas under attack; there were very few initial Ukrainian casualties and the command and control remained intact; (ii) Ukraine appears to have had remarkably good intelligence about the locations and plans of the elite Russian forces (including Chechens and the Wagner mercenaries), to the point where a very high proportion of Russian casualties in the early days of the war were among those elite troops; (iii) Ukrainian home guards have been very effective at detaining Russian sabotage and assassination teams (although, as an aside here, it may have something to do with the nature of the Ukrainian society, which Russians clearly do not understand. When I lived in Kyiv, I was amazed at how village-like the atmosphere is even in the very big cities, with everyone knowing their neighbours and instantly identifying “outsiders”. As a result, even during the complete mess of the early 1990s, Kyiv remained largely free of street crime outside the tourism areas of the central city. I can easily see how local patrols would instantly spot unusual behaviour and presence)

I can easily see how local patrols would instantly spot unusual behaviour and presence) Kleptocracy . We all knew that the theft of public property is a Russian national past-time (I should emphasise that this should not be confused with general criminality, but rather represents a public view that if I do not steal government stuff, someone else will, so I might as well. My experience of being in Russian was always that there was actually heightened respect for private property, and you could count on people’s honesty towards you as an individual). However, for some reason, we all assumed that somehow that kleptocracy would have only a limited effect on the Russian military. Even the Russian military vloggers who have spent years complaining about corruption are now saying they did not realise how bad things really were. The Ukrainian army is reporting that almost all military vehicles and tanks they are now capturing had entered Ukraine stripped of anything that could be sold on the civilian market. This means that they are missing radios, GPS devices, heating units (remember, the invasion is taking place in winter) and anything other than very basic rations. There has been a lot of speculation about why the Russian Airforce, which is infinitely superior to the Ukrainian one on paper has been largely ineffective. There are various explanations relating to institutional weaknesses, but the Russian military vloggers are saying that the feedback they are getting from their friends on active duty is that a large proportion of the planes are not operable due to the theft of fuel, electronics and other valuables, while pilots are generally very poorly trained in part, again due to theft of fuel: base commanders record fictitious flying hours, sell the fuel and then share proceeds among the officers.

Continued reliance on Soviet command structures but without the Soviet means of terror . Outside a very small contingent of the elite troops, the Russian army does not allow or rely on initiative, with soldiers provided with very specific orders and not being informed about the tactical or strategic objectives. As a result, as the situation on the ground changes, the inability to adjust to the tactical situation leads to strategic blunders. The Russian column heading to Kyiv from the north is a prime example. One Russian vlogger describes it as the world’s first and biggest self-managed POW camp. In essence, the troop movement was predicated on (i) Kyiv being taken by paratroopers, so that the column could be supplied within Ukraine, and on (ii) the ground remaining frozen so that the vehicles could fan out if they needed to take cover. The column set out after it was already clear that supply from within Ukraine would be impossible and after early warming led to ground turning to mud. As a result, the entire column is stuck on the highway, with the Ukrainians picking off the key points to make decongestion forward impossible, while the Russian troops are running out of food and fuel. There are reports of desperate attempts to decongest back to Belarus, but they do not seem to be progressing very well. In Soviet times, this institutional weakness was overcome in two ways: willingness to throw more and more bodies into the meatgrinder and the use of security troops to shoot anyone retreating. However, while Putin has recreated much of the Soviet security state, he is clearly still operating under greater societal constraints than the Soviet leaders. There was wide speculation in Russia on Thursday and Friday that the government would announce martial law and general mobilisation. However, the televised Security Council meeting did not raise those topics at all (I watched clips of the Russian TV coverage of the meeting, and it was a genuine Seinfeld kind of event about nothing. It was clear they were given a script which was changed at the last minute, so they all looked lost and just blathered). This suggests that there is growing domestic pressure on Putin.

It was clear they were given a script which was changed at the last minute, so they all looked lost and just blathered). This suggests that there is growing domestic pressure on Putin. Lack of understanding of Ukraine . As I have raved to you many times, Percy, I have loved the complete cultural transformation of Ukraine over the last 20 years into a genuinely open and free society. When we lived in Kyiv in the early 90s, even though I could speak the languages, I felt completely alien. Now, the way the Ukrainian society works makes perfect sense. They have lots of problems, but these are the kinds of problems free societies deal with and they are approaching them in the same way as any Western society would. This matters not just in terms of the Ukrainian motivation to fight (which has been well covered by the media here) but also in terms of what it takes to capture and secure the country. Russians have clearly planned their take-over of Ukraine in the same way one would take over Russia—the focus was on capturing the main administrative buildings. Russians clearly continue to believe that Ukraine functions in the same centralised way as Russia, and do not understand just how decentralised and bottom-up the Ukrainian society has become. As a result, even in areas where Russians have substantially penetrated the Ukrainian territory, they only have minimal control. Kherson is a very good example. Russians proclaimed that they have captured Kherson because they have control of the city administration buildings. However, effectively, Russian troops are confined to those buildings and even though the main elements of the Ukrainian army are currently focusing on Mykolaiv and are not engaging with the Russian troops in Kherson, the Russian army have almost no control over the city. You might have seen the footage of a major demonstration in Kherson on Saturday where crowds marched with Ukrainian flags around the streets, while Russians soldiers in the city administration building fired in the air (in 2019, I advised on the privatisation of the Port of Kherson, as well as another port—Olvia—in Mykolaiv, so got to know the area well. While Kherson is symbolically important as the largest Ukrainian town “captured” by Russia so far, it is strategically of very limited significance. The channels at Kherson are silted, and can only take vessels with draft not exceeding 6m. The main selling point of the port was that once there is future investment to unsilt the channels and to also deepen key river channels, Kherson could become an important river port for river shipping through to Belarus. Clearly not an immediate prospect )

Clearly not an immediate prospect ) Money. While Russia’s per capita GDP is higher than Ukraine’s, the extreme concentration of wealth in Russia and the theft of budget resources means that the average Russian is a bit poorer than the average Ukrainian, and has fewer resources to fall back on. In addition, the Russian budget is obviously being stressed by the war. As a result, Ukrainians involved in the conflict are better paid, which also leads to better motivation and better ability to look after their families. A Russian professional soldier (known as contract soldiers) earns 62,000 roubles per month. This was USD900 before the war and is now around USD500. The Ukrainian army is now paying USD3,000 per month to all active duty personnel. In Russia, as a result of the sanctions, pensions and social allowances are rapidly being eroded. The Ukrainian government increased pensions and introduced additional social allowances in the last week. The fact that all payment systems are continuing to operate in Ukraine, means that the economy is significantly less stressed than in Russia. In addition, Russia’s isolation means that it has to rely on its own limited resources to re-supply the army. Ukraine is seeing a huge influx of resources. The Western military equipment is better than Russian but also ridiculously expensive. My business partner and I have been fundraising for the Ukrainian army. We got the idea that we could sponsor at least one JAVELIN anti-tank missile and even had visions of having a Castalia logo painted on it. To our horror, it turns out the bloody thing cost USD175,000 a shot—a bit out of our fundraising range. So, Ukraine is using USD175,000 missiles to destroy Soviet era tanks stripped of anything valuable which are probably worth less than that in scrap. However, as long as the money from the West is pouring in, Ukraine actually has more financial and economic resources to apply to this war than Russia. Anyway, we ended up donating USD10,000 to the general account of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence that has been set up to receive individual donations for military operations. The account has so far collected over $50 million from Western individuals in 4 days.

So, back to the grand strategy. One thing that has been consistently overlooked in the Australian media is that this war is not new. It has been going on since 2014. Ukraine and Russia’s proxies have been locked in static battle around the line of control in Donetsk and Luhansk. When I was in Kherson, we went for a drive to the line of control (about 30km from Kherson) and were given maps of roads to avoid where Russian snipers were shooting at civilian cars. For us at the time, it was a bit of exciting war tourism—something I am deeply ashamed of now.

So, once this current phase of the war re-enters the static stage, we will have exactly the same, but over a much wider line of control, and with Russia under truly crippling sanctions (rather than the token once since 2014). In principle, there is every possibility that the situation will become frozen again: Russia will struggle economically, socially and culturally, but it will not starve. Western money will flow into Ukraine, with both continued strengthening of the Ukrainian economy and its military. Ukraine will be admitted as the candidate into the EU. So, cynical as it sounds, apart from the people trapped in the Russian controlled areas, the outcome will be a win both for Ukraine and for the West. Russia will rave and rage and increasingly become China’s vassal state, but it has raved and raged, and has been falling under Chinese dominance for some time. If Putin secures a land bridge from Crimea to DNR and LNR, he may even declare a victory and try to de-escalate a bit. Eventually, Putin will die of old age and the change in leadership may serve as an opportunity for a bit of a reset. I think this slow burn scenario is the most likely.

Then, of course, there are two possible fast burn scenarios. One is that Putin escalates, including into nuclear confrontation. In fact, if Putin escalates, it almost has to be into a nuclear confrontation as Russia is quickly exhausting its conventional resources. This is mind boggling, and I hope someone clever is thinking about how to respond to it.

The other, more realistic fast burn scenario, is a domestic revolt in Russia. I know a lot has been written about how Putin is well protected, there is no natural successor etc. It is all true. But here are some interesting considerations which I feel have not received sufficient attention:

Putin’s main power base are FSB and SVR. Yet, the flow of Russian intelligence to Ukraine and the public humiliation of the head of SVR on national television during the National Security Council’s televised “discussion” of the invasion indicate that his hold on this power base may not be all that secure

The decision to postpone the general mobilisation indicates that Putin still feels he needs support from the Russian middle class. Russia has general conscription, but the system is sufficiently corrupt so that the children of the elite and the middle class never serve. For now, those who run the government apparatus, the media, the education and science system know that their children are safe. If that changed, it is not clear if the Russian administrative and political system could survive

The economic sanctions imposed by the West are much more severe than anyone thought possible, but what is even more amazing is the wide outpouring of voluntary sanctions from various companies. There was a great article on Friday in the FT by my old friend Natalie Jaresko, Ukraine’s former Minister of Finance (Natalie is a Ukrainian-American. An interesting story: she did a deal with the White House that she would give up her American citizenship in order to become a Ukrainian cabinet minister, but on the understanding that she can always get it back. She has been in the US for the last 5 years and is currently the head of the fabulously named Puerto Rico Fiscal Junta—a supervisory body imposed by the US Congress on Puerto Rico to manage its bankrupt fiscal affairs). Natalie argues that ESG requirements and responsibilities of boards should clearly include not dealing with aggressor countries. I think this idea will spread. Yes, Chinese companies will step in, but there will be an overall impact on the Russian economy. As the current round of sanctions really bites, the population may become significantly less supine.

Finally, casualties. Russians are going all out to hide the extent of their casualties from their population. But so did the Soviets in the 1980s, with much more total control over information sources. The Soviet Union lost 15,000 soldiers in Afghanistan in 10 years. The Soviet population was obviously much higher than the Russian population alone. The indications are that Russia has lost about 10,000 soldiers in the ten days of fighting. Even if this stabilises, the impact on the society will keep spreading. Russian social media, even as it is being shut down, is full of rapidly spreading news. Interestingly also, there is a meme that Putin must be a CIA agent, since clearly no Russian could possible cause this much damage to his own country.

We will wait with sadness and horror. Once this is over, and I go back to what I have no doubt will remain free Kyiv, I have no idea how I will look my friends and business contacts in the eye given the suffering they went through and the pathetically little we could do. Moral indignation alone just does not cut it. But with every day I am seeing signs of Ukraine not just doing better than expected, but actually positioning itself for the post-war future.

During the COVID period, I have continued to work closely with Ukraine. My main business dealings are with the Ministry of Infrastructure, which has always impressed me with its competence and focus on achieving its targets, even if the progress has been slow due to the vestiges of the Soviet system (Another interesting aside: until now, Ukraine has retained the Soviet system of bureaucratic management, where each Ministry is governed by a council of top managers, and each decision of the ministry requires each top manager to sign off on it individually; this was a form of compulsory consensus used in the Soviet Union to make everyone personally liable for each action of the State, and hence to keep officials in fear. Ukraine no longer obviously has the fear element, but the culture of consensus makes progress hellishly slow. For the privatisation of the Port of Kherson, where the terms had to be agreed by a number of key Ministries, we had to collect almost 200 individual signatures: something that took six months after all the strategic decisions were made at the Cabinet level).

I now realise that the competence I have encountered has been generally spread across the government, while the war situation seems to be sweeping away the bureaucratic habits and constraints.

One final personal observation. I think in one of my previous emails I mentioned a good friend in Kyiv who is an ethnically Russian woman from Donetsk who in 2016 decided she can no longer tolerate the criminal thugs who run the self-proclaimed “republic”, abandoned her property and moved to Kyiv. Andra and I met her walking her dog in a park in Kyiv in 2017—a result of Andra’s terrifying capacity to make instant best friends over deep discussions of dog behaviour. We have remained in touch, and would see her every time we visited Kyiv (our last visit was in February 2020—we got back to Australia a few days before the border closed). Her mood was politically strongly pro-Ukrainian but she is culturally very Russian and, as she does not speak English, we always communicated in Russian. She has been keeping us informed of the situation in Kyiv. However, as of three days ago she started writing exclusively in Ukrainian, which neither I nor she know as well as Russian (Andra can get by in Russian but does not know Ukrainian at all). She says she can no longer bring herself to use Russian, she is too angry and ashamed. I know how she feels. Last week in New York I caught up with some Russian friends and I felt I should be apologising to people around me for speaking Russian. Putin is obviously causing suffering in Ukraine, but the real long-term damage he is doing is to Russia. Perhaps he is a CIA plant.

Before, my wife and I hardly ever ate bread. At least, if we weren’t in the village where we sometimes spend weekends away from our home in Kyiv. The bread we bought in the village was always tastier than the city stuff. In the Ukrainian countryside, there is a long tradition of having plenty of bread on the table and of eating it with butter and salt or dipping it in milk. Bread dipped in fresh cow’s milk was also given to little kids and they loved it.

Since arriving in western Ukraine, where like hundreds of thousands of my fellow countrymen my family has sought relative safety, we find ourselves eating much more bread than before.

Our boys have always loved fresh bread. They enjoy making and eating sandwiches. In our village shop, we would buy our favourite Makariv loaf – a soft, white, brick-shaped loaf. It was baked at the well-known Makariv bakery which is 20km from our village. Occasionally, you could find this bread in Kyiv, but only in small corner shops, not supermarkets.

I have been thinking about that Makariv bread for several days now, remembering the taste. Only now, as I remember, I sense the taste of blood on my lips, like when I was a child if someone split my lip in a fight.

The fact is Makariv bakery was bombed a few days ago by Russian troops. The bakers were at work. I can imagine the fragrant smell that surrounded them the moment before the attack. In an instant, 13 bakery staff were killedand nine were injured. And the bakery is no more – “Makariv bread” is a thing of the past.

I have long since run out of words to describe the horror brought by Putin to Ukrainian soil. Ukraine is the land of bread and wheat. Even in Egypt, bread and cakes are baked using Ukrainian flour. It’s the time of year to prepare the fields for sowing, but this work is not being done. The soil of the wheat fields is full of metal – fragments of shells, pieces of blown-up tanks and cars, the remains of downed planes and helicopters. And it’s all covered in blood. The blood of Russian soldiers who do not understand what they are fighting for, and the blood of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians who know that if they do not fight, Ukraine will no longer exist. In its place there will be a cemetery with a caretaker’s hut and some kind of governor general sent from Russia will sit and guard it.

Bread was mixed with blood in Chernihiv as well when Russian bombers dropped “dumb” unguided bombs on a square next to a bread shop. People had lined up outside, waiting to buy some fresh, warm bread. Someone was just leaving the store with a bag of it. Many people died in this bombing raid. Amnesty International has documented this crime committed by the Russian army. Every day the list of crimes grows longer as more and more of Putin’s actions are added to it – the shooting of young volunteers who were carrying food to the dog shelter in Hostomel; the murder of postmen who were delivering pensions to elderly residents in Sumy region; the killing of five people in an attack on the Kyiv television tower. The list goes on and on. We certainly don’t yet know about all the crimes that have been committed, but we will definitely find out about them all, and the list will be presented at a new Nuremberg trial. It doesn’t matter where it takes place. The main thing is that we know who will be judged.

International lawyers have already begun to collect evidence of crimes. Ukrainians are looking forward to the verdict on the murderers and war criminals. But for now, they must survive under the shelling of the Russian army. They spend their nights in basements, in bomb shelters, in bathrooms – the latest advice circulating on the internet tells us that in case of a bombing raid, the safest places to be are inside your cast-iron bath or in interior corridors where there are no windows.

The people of Kyiv have grown suddenly much more attached to their metro, one of the most beautiful and deepest in the world. The metro is no longer a form of transport – it is a haven, like something from an apocalyptic movie. It is covered with signs of permanent presence of non-travelling “passengers” and there is living space everywhere. The station platforms are being turned into cinemas where films are shown for free – children’s films in the morning and films for a wider audience later in the day. Large screens have already been hung or are being hung right now at 14 Kyiv metro stations. There is a constant supply of tea, the internet is already there, but the connection is poor. There are not enough toilets, but people don’t complain about queuing for 40 minutes or more. Everyone waits patiently. They are waiting for the end of the war and the beginning of the trial – a trial that the whole world will have to follow, as the whole world followed at Nuremberg.

And, in Russia, what do they think about the future court proceedings? I am afraid they don’t think about it at all. They are now busy buying dollars and euros. Sanctions targeting the banking sector have caused the value of the rouble to fall dramatically, provoking panic. Panic is also observed on the Russian-Finnish border, via which many Russians are now trying to leave their homeland. They are those who are ashamed to stay in Russia, and those who could be drafted into the army, those who do not want to die or do not want to kill or do not want to be cannon fodder for the Kremlin.

Some captured Russian soldiers have asked for permission to remain in Ukraine for good. “Jail awaits us if we return!” they say.

On the borders of Ukraine with Moldova, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland, there are still queues of refugees. It’s said that some Ukrainians are trying to leave the country using fake Russian passports. These are those who don’t want to fight either. I won’t judge them. Let time and history judge everyone. I am glad that at this most difficult of times, most Ukrainians have maintained their humanity and try to help each other. Mobilisation has been announced, but no one is forcibly taken into the army. Those who themselves want to defend their homeland come to the military registration and enlistment offices and get registered. Most often, they are asked to leave a phone number and to wait for a call. There are many who want to fight the invaders, but not all of those who want to fight are really ready to participate in military action.

In the last couple of days, I’ve started to dread opening Facebook. More and more often in the news feed, I see posts by young Ukrainian women declaring their love for their recently killed husbands. I know some of these women and have met their husbands. I cannot read these cries of despair thrown into the bottomless well of the internet without tears.

But I can’t not read them either. I want to see and hear everything that is happening now in my country. I know that in the occupied Melitopol, in the south of Ukraine, arrests of Crimean Tatar activists and other active citizens have begun. I know that the workers of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant have been kept inside the station by the Russian invaders, that their mobile phones were taken away and that they have not been allowed to leave the station for more than a week now. Moscow television propagandists have gone there under the protection of the Russian military to make news stories. I don’t know what they are saying in Russia about this war, about the captured Chernobyl nuclear power plant, about the captured Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant , which is still in operation. Why do they need this non-military atomic installation? Are they planning to blackmail Ukraine and the world? Why are they bombing children’s hospitals and schools? Why destroy residential areas of Chernihiv, Borodianka, Kharkiv, and Mariupol? Why, after all, are they bombing bakeries and bread shops? I don’t have answers to these questions. “You can’t understand Russia with your mind!” wrote the 19th-century Russian poet Fyodor Tyutchev. I agree with him, but I still have a question: how can one understand Russia at all, if the mind does not help?

Weapons from the European Union for Ukraine March 8, 2022

Posted by bohdan.warchomij in : Metaphor Online

A mong the many ways in which the world has changed recently is the willingness of some governments to ship weapons to Ukraine. Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked invasion of a sovereign state has shocked other Europeans into breaking old pacifist taboos. Germany, which had long refused to send arms to conflict zones and sent Ukraine a derisory pre-war gift of 5,000 helmets, is now sending anti-tank and surface-to-air missiles. The European Union, an entity with zero troops and one Nobel peace prize, is sending €450m-worth ($499m) of lethal gear. Even tiny Luxembourg is sending jeeps, tents and 100 NLAW anti-tank missiles, one for every 6,000 of its citizens. Western governments do not want to risk a direct conflict with Russia by sending their own troops, but are eager to help Ukraine defend itself. How are these military supplies getting into Ukraine?

Since 2014 many countries have supplied non-lethal military aid to Ukraine. America agreed to supply lethal weapons in 2017. In April 2018 the first delivery, comprising 210 Javelin missiles and 37 launchers, arrived. Before the war started, such supplies could simply be flown to Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. Now the EU is despatching through to Lviv via the routes Ukrainian refugees are using to escape to Poland and Romania.

Ukrainian Presidential Decree: Monday 8 March 2022 Bankova KYIV March 8, 2022

Posted by bohdan.warchomij in : Metaphor Online

Monday. Evening. You know, we used to say: Monday is a hard day. There is a war in the country. So every day is Monday.

And now we are used to the fact that every day and every night are like that.

Today is the 12th. 12th evening of our struggle. Our defense.

We are all on the ground, we are all working.

Everyone is where they should be. I am in Kyiv. My team is with me. The territorial defense is on the ground. The servicemen are in positions. Our heroes! Doctors, rescuers, transporters, diplomats, journalists…

Everyone. We are all at war. We all contribute to our victory, which will definitely be achieved. By force of arms and our army. By force of words and our diplomacy. By force of spirit, which the first, the second and each of us have.

Take a look at our country today.

Chaplynka, Melitopol, Tokmak, Novotroitske and Kherson. Starobilsk. Everywhere people defended themselves, although they do not have weapons there. But these are our people, and that’s why they have weapons.

They have courage. Dignity. And hence the ability to go out and say: I’m here, it’s mine, and I won’t give it away. My city. My community. My Ukraine.

Every Ukrainian man and woman who protested against the invaders yesterday, today and will protest tomorrow are heroes.

We shout at the invaders together with you. We stand in the squares and streets with you. We are not afraid with you when the invaders open fire and try to drive everyone away.

YOU do not back down.

WE do not back down.

And the one who repeated: “We are one people” – certainly did not expect such a powerful reaction.

In the south of our country, such a national movement has unfolded, such a powerful manifestation of Ukrainianness that we have never seen in the streets and squares there. And for Russia it is like a nightmare.

They forgot that we are not afraid of paddy wagons and batons. We are not afraid of tanks and machine guns. When the main thing is on our side, truth. As it is now.

Mariupol and Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Sumy. Odesa and Kyiv. Mykolaiv. Zhytomyr and Korosten. Ovruch. And many other cities.

We know that hatred that the enemy brought to our cities with shelling and bombing will not remain there. There will be no trace of it. Hatred is not about us. Therefore, there will be no trace of the enemy. We will rebuild everything. We will make our cities destroyed by the invader better than any city in Russia.

Enerhodar. Chornobyl. And other places where barbarians just don’t understand WHAT they want to capture. WHAT they want to control. Your work, your hard work on critical objects is a real feat. And we see it. We are sincerely grateful for it.

The Ukrainian army holds positions. Well done! It inflicts extremely painful losses on the enemy. Defends. Counterattacks. If necessary – can take revenge. Necessarily. For every evil. For every rocket and bomb. For each destroyed civilian object.

Today in Makariv, Kyiv region, they fired at the bread factory. For what? The old bread factory! Think about it – to fire at the bread factory. Who should you be to do that?

Or to destroy another church – in the Zhytomyr region. The Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin built in 1862.

These are NOT people.

There was an agreement on humanitarian corridors.

Did it work? Russian tanks worked instead. Russian “Grads”. Russian mines. They even mined the road, which was agreed to transport food and medicine for people and children in Mariupol.

They even destroy buses that have to take people out. But … At the same time, they are opening a small corridor to the occupied territory. For several dozen people. Not so much to Russia, as to propagandists. Directly to their TV cameras. Like, that’s the one who saves. Just cynicism. Just propaganda. Nothing more. No humanitarian sense.

The third round of negotiations in Belarus took place today. I would like to say – the third and final. But we are realists. So we will talk. We will insist on negotiations until we find a way to tell our people: this is how we will come to peace.

Exactly to peace.

We must realize that every day of struggle, every day of resistance creates better conditions for us. Strong position to guarantee our future. In peace. After this war.

Apart from the dead people and the destroyed cities, the war leaves destroyed the aspirations that once seemed very important, but now … You don’t even mention them.

Almost three years ago, as soon as the election took place, we entered this building, this office, and immediately began planning our move.

I dreamed of moving from Bankova. Together with the government and parliament. To unload the center of Kyiv and in general – to move to a modern, transparent office – as befits a progressive democratic European country.

Now I will say one thing: I stay here.

I stay in Kyiv.

On Bankova Street.

I’m not hiding.

And I’m not afraid of anyone.

As much as it takes to win this Patriotic War of ours.

Today I signed a decree to present state awards of Ukraine to 96 Ukrainian heroes – our military.

Including…

The Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky of the second degree is awarded to:

Major Oleksandr Oleksandrovych Sak. Commander of the mechanized battalion who entered the battle with the battalion tactical group of the enemy and won thanks to a rational approach to combat and non-standard tactics.

Captain Rostyslav Oleksandrovych Sylivakin. Commander of the mechanized battalion, which successfully fought the overwhelming forces of the enemy, liberating Ukrainian towns and villages in the Sumy region.

The Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky of the third degree is awarded to:

Lieutenant Ihor Serhiyovych Lozovyi. Acting as part of the group, he stopped a column of enemy vehicles numbering about 150 units, which was moving in the direction of the Zhytomyr-Kyiv route. Destroyed.

Lieutenant Vitaliy Viktorovych Poturemets. He showed exemplary courage and composure in the battle, destroying a column of enemy equipment near the city of Kyiv. He was wounded.

The Order “For Courage” of the third degree is awarded to:

Master Sergeant, Commander of the Automobile Platoon Valentyn Viktorovych Baryliuk. Thanks to his brave actions and personal determination, the tank unit received fuel in time and left the encirclement, destroying the enemy on the way.

All 96 of our heroes are like these five!

Our gratitude to all the military.

Our gratitude to the Armed Forces of Ukraine!

Our gratitude is boundless.

Glory to Ukraine!

Perth Protest against Russia’s Unprovoked War on Ukraine Photos Bohdan Warchomij March 5, 2022

Posted by bohdan.warchomij in : Metaphor Online

Two thousand people turned up in Supreme Court Gardens today for a peaceful protest against the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the aggressive and ruthless bombing of Ukrainian cities, hospitals, kindergartens and private residences. They were addressed by Ukrainian convenors Lesa Morgan and Diane Teplyj, Labour politicians Roger Cook and Patrick Gorman and marched from the Gardens to Elizabeth Quay in protest against what has become an immoral and unprovoked war .

In 2021 and early 2022, there was a major Russian military build-up around Ukraine’s borders. NATO accused Russia of planning an invasion, which it denied. Russian President Vladimir Putin criticized the enlargement of NATO as a threat to his country and demanded Ukraine be barred from ever joining the military alliance. He also expressed Russian irredentist views, questioned Ukraine’s right to exist, and stated Ukraine was wrongfully created by Soviet Russia. Historically incorrect this view has become an excuse by Putin to conduct this illegal war.

On 21 February 2022, Russia officially recognised the two self-proclaimed separatist states in the Donbas, and sent troops to the territories. Three days later, Russia invaded Ukraine after Putin announced a “special military operation”. Much of the international community and organizations such as Amnesty International have condemned Russia for its actions in post-revolutionary Ukraine, accusing it of breaking international law and violating Ukrainian sovereignty. Many countries implemented economic sanctions against Russia, Russian individuals, or companies, especially after the 2022 invasion.

Walking through the Doha airport in the early hours of the morning, Andrii Zadorozhnyi is wrapped in a Ukrainian flag and is desperate to get home.

Andrii works for the United Nations in Nepal and once he crosses into Ukraine, he won’t be allowed to leave again.

But his new mission is deeply personal and, he says, absolute in its importance.

“What I want right now is to be in my country,” he said.

This terminal is a hive of activity as Ukrainians who have travelled across the border to escape war file off buses that then turn around and carry men back towards the front.

On this day, a group of colleagues from Germany, a seaman who left his vessel in the United States, and a reservist working in Saudi Arabia are among them — all Ukrainian, and all intent on defending their country.

They’ve gone to great lengths just to get this far.

Oleksandr Petrov is from Crimea, a region annexed by Russia in 2014. He was once in Ukraine’s airborne division and now serves as a reservist.

“I came from Saudi Arabia. When it started, I asked my company to provide me tickets to go home and my company organised a transfer for me,” he said.

“When the foreign aggressors are coming, it’s like a reaction, it’s like a reflex. We are understanding now our history is being written.

“It’s a big page and I’m not happy this page is written by the bloody letters. It’s a very bad thing, but it’s the rules of our life.”

Oleksandr is angry at the slow pace of his travel home and nervous that he hasn’t heard from some of his brothers in the military for several days.

Like others, his plan is to take a bus to the border, cross to the other side and join the first unit he comes across.

There is a complete lack of apprehension over the battle ahead and a certainty of its outcome.

Oleksandr’s phone is ringing non-stop with calls from friends and colleagues co-ordinating their own missions home. He’s not surprised, he wouldn’t expect any other reaction.

Ukrainians know the price of freedom, he said, “and now we have to pay.”

Oleksandr has training and experience, but at this bus station, many Ukrainians making the journey with him have never fought in a war.

“Actually, I am a seaman and I was on a contract, and right now I’m coming from the United States of America,” Oleh Novikov said.

“My home in Marioupol is surrounded with this f**king Russian occupation. My wife, my son, are inside… so I cannot stay, I must go home.

“I will go to the nearest army, I want to fight. I have no experience. I am a civilian.”

It’s estimated at least 2 million Ukrainians work abroad and men represent 70 per cent of that figure.

A father and son waiting to board a bus only left Ukraine a week ago. They came to Poland to work and send money home, but now they’re headed back to fight.

They’re answering the calls of Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who urged his people to take up arms and join the resistance against Russia.

“This bloody dictator from Russia has done this impossible thing. He has united the country as no-one in politics or our previous presidents did before.

From across the world, Ukrainians are heading home to be on their land, with their people and to fight for their future.

Andrii flew from Doha to Warsaw, picked up supplies and then boarded an overnight bus for the border. He’s now in Western Ukraine.

He said he was going home to first be with his family, second to support his colleagues and “if necessary” he would take up arms.

There are plenty more like him.

For many Ukrainians making the journey home, West Warsaw station is their last stop before heading to the Poland-Ukraine border.

First Ukrainians from 1949 and recent arrivals, since Ukrainian Independence in 1991, combined in a powerful and purposeful demonstration at the Wesley Uniting church in William Street in a protest against the Russian Invasion of Ukraine two days ago.

Ukraine officially declared itself an independent country on 24 August 1991, when the communist Supreme Soviet (parliament) of Ukraine proclaimed that Ukraine would no longer follow the laws of USSR and only the laws of the Ukrainian SSR, de facto declaring Ukraine’s independence from the Soviet Union.

Now they are fighting ferociously for independence against a well armed enemy that attacked Ukraine on multiple fronts, from Belorus, from Eastern Ukraine and from the Black Sea.

In a press conference today Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said they would win the battle, emphatically making the point that captured Russian soldiers have not been told anything about their mission in Ukraine. ”

”He issued another plea to Russian people to help stop the war by putting pressure on Vladimir Putin and his government. Anti-war protesters have been arrested in recent days in Moscow and St Petersburg.

“I want everyone in Russia to hear me. Everybody. Hundreds of captured soldiers who are here in Ukraine don’t know why they were sent here to kill people or be killed. People need to tell the government why the war has to be stopped, more people from your country will stay alive.",http://www.metaphorimages.com/wordpress/?cat=606&paged=2
