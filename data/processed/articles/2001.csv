One month of war has had a devastating impact on Ukraine’s health system, severely restricted access to services, and triggered an urgent need to treat trauma injuries and chronic conditions. Destroyed health infrastructure and disrupted chains of medical supplies now pose a grave threat to millions of people.

Impact on health

Close to 7 million people are internally displaced, and the number of people that have fled to neighbouring countries is fast approaching 4 million.

That means that 1 in 4 Ukrainians are now forcibly displaced, aggravating the condition of those suffering from noncommunicable diseases. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), 1 in 3 of the internally displaced suffers from a chronic condition.

A number of hospitals have been repurposed to care for the wounded: a shift due to necessity – which comes at the cost of essential services and primary health care. Approximately half of Ukraine’s pharmacies are thought to be closed. Many health workers are displaced themselves or unable to work.

Close to 1000 health facilities are close to conflict lines or are in changed areas of control. The consequence of that – limited or no access to medicines, facilities and health professionals – mean that treatments of chronic conditions have almost stopped.

COVID-19 vaccination and routine immunization has also come to a halt. Prior to the invasion, at least 50 000 people were getting vaccinated against COVID-19 per day. Between 24 February and 15 March, however, only 175 000 people were vaccinated against COVID-19.

Attacks on health care

As of 22 March, WHO had verified 64 incidents of attacks on health care in 25 days (between 24 February and 21 March) causing 15 deaths and 37 injuries. That is 2–3 attacks per day. WHO condemns these attacks in the strongest possible terms.

“Attacks on health care are a violation of international humanitarian law, but a disturbingly common tactic of war – they destroy critical infrastructure, but worse, they destroy hope,” said Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO representative in Ukraine. “They deprive already vulnerable people of care that is often the difference between life and death. Health care is not – and should never be – a target.”

WHO’s response

On the day the war started, WHO activated its contingency plans, repurposed staff and projects, and shifted focus to emergency needs – to support Ukraine’s health system and workers.

WHO works closely with Ukraine’s Ministry of Health and authorities to identify gaps and needs in the country’s health system – and swiftly respond. WHO has opened an operations hub in Rzeszów in Poland, developed a pipeline of trauma supplies to most Ukrainian cities, and sent more than 100 metric tonnes of medical equipment over the border, to health facilities across the country.

Some 36 metric tonnes of supplies are currently on their way to Lviv, with an additional 108 metric tonnes waiting to be dispatched, consisting of trauma supplies, medication for chronic diseases, paediatric drugs and blood transfusion supplies.

“What we are delivering – and where – meets the very needs of people on the ground, where Ukrainian health workers are working around the clock in unimaginable circumstances. A team of trained health-care professionals can, with one WHO trauma kit that contains surgical equipment, consumables and antiseptics – save the lives of 150 wounded people. In other words, delivering 10 such kits, means 1500 lives saved,” said Dr Habicht.

As part of a United Nations convoy on 18 March, a WHO truck also reached Sumy in the north-east of Ukraine, carrying critical medical supplies sufficient to treat 150 trauma patients and provide primary health care to 15 000 patients for 3 months. Among other deliveries to health facilities in past days are artificial lung ventilation machines, chemical protection suits, a haematology analyser, liquid oxygen bulk tanks and cryogenic cylinders.

More than 20 emergency medical teams have also been deployed to Ukraine, Poland and the Republic of Moldova, to provide training and specialized medical care to supplement existing services.

In an assessment of the public health situation in refugee-hosting countries (see link below), WHO identifies and lists key health risks and makes related recommendations – on vaccine-preventable diseases, maternal and child health, and chronic infectious and noncommunicable diseases.

“I have seen with my own eyes the exceptional humanitarian response in neighbouring countries, but this emergency is far from over. We expect more people – mainly women, children and older persons – with even greater health needs to be displaced in the coming weeks. They may face challenges in accessing the services and medicines that they need – and this can have life-threatening consequences,” said Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe.","https://www.euro.who.int/en/media-centre/sections/press-releases/2022/ukraine-28-days-of-war,-64-verified-attacks-on-health-care,-and-18-million-people-affected"

The World Health Organisation (WHO) says it has verified some 64 attacks on health care facilities in Ukraine since Russia began its invasion a month ago.

The confirmed the attacks took place between February 24 and March 21 at a rate of between two and three each day, killing at least 15 people, the WHO said in a statement.

“Attacks on health care are a violation of international humanitarian law, but a disturbingly common tactic of war – they destroy critical infrastructure, but worse, they destroy hope,” said Dr Jarno Habicht, the WHO representative in Ukraine. “They deprive already vulnerable people of care that is often the difference between life and death. Health care is not – and should never be – a target.”

Ukraine has accused Russia of bombing hospitals and health facilities including a children’s and maternity hospital in the besieged city of Mariupol in what one city officials called “a war crime without justification”.

Nearly four million people have been forced to flee the country, according to the UN, with Ukraine putting up fierce resistance in the face of the Russian advance. Cities, including Kharkiv, Kyiv and Mariupol, have come under intense aerial bombardment with people forced into underground shelters for safety.

On Wednesday, the United States said it had determined that Russia had committed war crimes in Ukraine, singling out the bombardment of Mariupol and the attack on the maternity hospital.

“Our assessment is based on a careful review of available information from public and intelligence sources. As with any alleged crime, a court of law with jurisdiction over the crime is ultimately responsible for determining criminal guilt in specific cases,” said US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

Russia has denied that it has deliberately targeted civilians.

The four-week war has also forced Ukraine to repurpose hospitals to care for the wounded, disrupting the provision of basic medical services to the rest of the population.

Nearly 1,000 health facilities are close to the front lines or in areas of occupation, the WHO noted.

“The consequence of that – limited or no access to medicines, facilities and health professionals – mean that treatments of chronic conditions have almost stopped,” the statement said.

About half of the country’s pharmacies are thought to be closed, with many healthcare workers displaced by the fighting or unable to work, it added.

COVID-19 vaccination and routine immunisation have also come to a halt.

Before the invasion, at least 50,000 people were being vaccinated against COVID-19 every day. The WHO says that between February 24 and March 15, just 175,000 people were vaccinated against the virus.

The UN agency said it was working closely with Ukraine’s Ministry of Health to address the problems caused by the war and had sent more than 100 metric tonnes of medical equipment over the border to health facilities across the country.

Some 36 metric tonnes of supplies including trauma kits, medication for chronic diseases, and paediatric drugs are currently on their way to the western city of Lviv, with an additional 108 metric tonnes waiting to be dispatched.

“What we are delivering – and where – meets the very needs of people on the ground, where Ukrainian health workers are working around the clock in unimaginable circumstances. A team of trained healthcare professionals can, with one WHO trauma kit that contains surgical equipment, consumables, and antiseptics – save the lives of 150 wounded people. In other words, delivering 10 such kits means 1,500 lives saved,” said Dr Habicht.

The WHO said it also sent urgent medical supplies – sufficient to treat 150 trauma patients and provide healthcare to 15,000 patients for three months – as part of a United Nations convoy to Sumy, in northeastern Ukraine, earlier this month.

The W.H.O. and other organizations are deploying medical teams and shipping supplies, vaccines and drugs to Ukraine and to neighboring countries. But the aid may never reach areas of active conflict.

‘It’s very scary’

During the pandemic lockdowns, the Ukrainian government began disbursing three-month supplies of medications for H.I.V. and tuberculosis. But many Ukrainians forced to abandon their demolished cities were able to take only limited supplies of the medications needed to keep them alive.

Elizaveta Grib, 16, fled her home in Kyiv with her mother and younger brother on Feb. 28, four days after the bombing began. They packed what they could in suitcases and made their way by train to Mykolaiv, a city near the southern port of Odessa that came under heavy bombardment by Russian forces.

Ms. Grib’s tuberculosis was diagnosed in September 2020 and she took some of her medicines with her, but now is unsure how she might obtain the drugs long-term. Without treatment, her disease could become resistant to all available therapies, perhaps even claiming her life.

“It’s very scary,” she said.

At least 1,200 people with tuberculosis are thought to have fled Ukraine. The Alliance for Public Health, a nonprofit organization, is helping more than 400 such patients in countries like Poland and Moldova. The W.H.O., too, has readied a stockpile of tuberculosis drugs in Poland for refugees from Ukraine.

But most of the refugees are women and children, while the majority of Ukrainians with drug-resistant TB are men who must stay in the country and fight, said Andriy Klepikov, executive director of the alliance.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/26/health/ukraine-health-tb-hiv.html

Russia's war in Ukraine has displaced some 4.3 million children in the past month — more than half of the country's estimated 7.5 million child population, according to UNICEF.

The organization said Thursday that this figure includes some 2.5 million children who are now internally displaced inside Ukraine, and more than 1.8 million who have crossed into neighboring countries as refugees.

The ongoing conflict has created one of the fastest large-scale displacements of children since World War II, UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said in a statement.

""This is a grim milestone that could have lasting consequences for generations to come,"" Russell added. ""Children's safety, wellbeing and access to essential services are all under threat from non-stop horrific violence.""

Overall, the war has displaced 1 in 4 Ukrainians. Ten million people have left their homes since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, with more than 3.6 million refugees fleeing to neighboring countries.

While most want to stay in Europe, the Biden administration said Thursday that the U.S. will welcome up to 100,000 Ukrainians and other displaced people fleeing the conflict.

Russian strikes have also damaged civilian infrastructure and limited access to health care, education and other basic services across the country.

On Thursday, the World Health Organization said it had verified 64 attacks on Ukraine's health care system in just 25 days, averaging two or three per day. UNICEF says that officials have already seen a drop in vaccinations for routine and childhood immunizations like measles and polio.

""This could quickly lead to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases especially in overcrowded areas where people are sheltering from the violence,"" it adds.

Ukraine's Ministry of Education and Science has reported damage to more than 500 education facilities (some of which have been used as civilian shelters).

UNICEF says that some 4.6 million people have limited access to safe water — with an estimated 1.4 million lacking access entirely — and that more than 450,000 children between the ages of 6 months and 23 months now need complementary food support.

""UNICEF continues to appeal for an immediate cease-fire and for the protection of children from harm,"" Russell said. ""Essential infrastructure on which children depend, including hospitals, schools and buildings sheltering civilians, must never come under attack.""

In the meantime, the organization is taking steps to help families and children in the region.

UNICEF says it's delivered medical supplies to hospitals across Ukraine, improving access to health care for 400,000 mothers, newborns and children. It's also increasing the number of mobile child protection teams working inside conflict zones from 22 to 50. And it plans to ""start emergency cash transfers to the most vulnerable families and establish child friendly spaces in key locations across the country.""

The U.N. Human Rights Office confirms that 78 children have been killed and 105 injured in Ukraine, but says those figures are likely a significant undercount.

We now know that more than 200,000 people lack access to water across the Donetska oblast in the country’s east. That is according to authorities and our humanitarian colleagues.

More people could be cut off from the water supply as clashes continue in the area, potentially leaving millions of people without access to water.

Attacks on healthcare are continuing. The World Health Organization said that, since 24 February, there now have been 64 attacks on health facilities, health care workers and ambulances. Health workers, healthcare facilities and supplies must never be targeted. It is sad that we need to say that over and over again: Any attacks on healthcare are a violation of international humanitarian law.

The International Organization for Migration (IOM) is managing regional hotlines to help people move safely and have had more than 15,000 consultations in the last few weeks.

They tell us that people are seeking information regarding human trafficking, as well as safe travel, how to seek asylum and obtain refugee status, and how to receive support from diplomatic institutions and other organizations.

And a cash update for you: we are still at 38 per cent level of the $1.1 billion 2022 Ukraine Flash Appeal. We thank the donors who released their pledged money amounts and encourage others to convert pledges to cash as quickly as possible. And of course the phone banks, as they say in telethons, remain open for people who have yet to pledge and we would hope more pledges come through and more cash comes through.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-un-work-ukraine-23032022-enuk
