Biden said in a statement that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ""chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering.""

He called the military operation, which Putin announced in a televised speech just before dawn on Thursday in Moscow, an “unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces.”

“Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way,"" he said. “The world will hold Russia accountable.""

Earlier this week Putin formally recognized the independence of two Moscow-backed breakaway regions in the eastern part of the country and ordered troops into the area, attempting to frame it as a ""peacekeeping” effort.

The move was condemned, and Biden announced sanctions against Russia in response. In the wake of the long-feared attack on Ukraine, he promised harsher action would follow.

The White House released a written statement following Biden's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. In the statement, Biden said he briefed Zelenskyy on the steps his administration is taking to ""rally international condemnation"" against Russia.

Biden said Zelenskyy had reached out to him and asked Biden to call on world leaders to “speak out clearly against President Putin’s flagrant aggression,” the statement said.

“Tomorrow, I will be meeting with the Leaders of the G7, and the United States and our Allies and partners will be imposing severe sanctions on Russia,” he said. “We will continue to provide support and assistance to Ukraine and the Ukrainian people.”

A White House official said the sanctions would be significant new actions to punish Russia, but would not say that the U.S. would unload every financial penalty in its arsenal.

Zelenskyy said Thursday that he was imposing martial law, but urged his citizens to remain calm. ""Putin has started a war with Ukraine and with all the democratic world,"" he said.

Leaders of other nations also condemned Russia's military action and vowed to level fresh penalties on Moscow.

French President Emmanuel Macron condemned Russia’s action while NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said NATO allies would meet to tackle the consequences of Russia’s “reckless and unprovoked attack.”

The European Union said it was planning the “strongest, the harshest package” of sanctions it has ever considered at an emergency summit Thursday.

U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was appalled, and Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that his country condemns Russia’s attack. Mexico’s secretary of foreign affairs also rejected the use of force and supported efforts for peace.

“These reckless and dangerous acts will not go unpunished,” Trudeau said in a statement.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who moved Tuesday to suspend certification for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline in response to Russia’s actions this week, called it “a terrible day for Ukraine and a dark day for Europe.”",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/putin-chosen-premeditated-war-military-operation-ukraine-biden-says-rcna17489

US President Joe Biden released a statement late Wednesday saying that Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a ""premeditated war"" against Ukraine.

The statement came after Putin announced a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, with reports of explosions and flares coming minutes afterwards, including in Ukraine's capital city, Kyiv.

""The prayers of the entire world are with the people of Ukraine tonight as they suffer an unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces,"" Biden said in his statement.

""Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring,"" the statement said. ""The world will hold Russia accountable.""

Biden went on to say that he's monitoring the situation from the White House and will receive regular updates from his national security team. The president also said he will meet Thursday with G7 leaders and address the American public about ""further consequences the United States and our Allies and partners will impose on Russia for this needless act of aggression against Ukraine and global peace and security.""

""We will also coordinate with our NATO Allies to ensure a strong, united response that deters any aggression against the Alliance,"" the statement said. ""Tonight, Jill and I are praying for the brave and proud people of Ukraine.""

Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's minister of foreign affairs, confirmed the attack in a tweet, writing, ""Putin has just launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Peaceful Ukrainian cities are under strikes. This is a war of aggression. Ukraine will defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now.""

Putin's military assault against Ukraine came less than an hour after NBC Nightly News aired an interview with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in which he warned that ""everything seems to be in place"" for Russia to attack Ukraine before the night was over.

A senior defense official also told reporters Wednesday that a large-scale invasion may be imminent and that Russian forces were ""as ready as they can be.""

Minutes after Putin announced the assault against Ukraine, blasts were heard from near Kyiv to the eastern city of Kharkiv, according to CNN, with reports of outgoing artillery fire from Russian forces across the border.

Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who sits on the US Senate Intelligence Committee, said on Twitter that Russia is now moving toward ""establishing air superiority via targeted surgical strikes"" in an effort to ""trap Ukrainian forces in the east"" and cut them off from Kyiv. He also said Russia is working to topple Ukraine's government by targeting government buildings, leaders and command and control systems.

Rubio did not say where he was getting the information from, and it has not been independently confirmed.

Condemnation from other global leaders came swiftly after Putin launched his assault.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg released a statement calling Russia's attack ""reckless"" and saying it ""puts at risk countless civilian lives.""

""This is a grave breach of international law & a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security,"" he said, adding that NATO allies ""will meet to address Russia's renewed aggression.""

""This is the saddest moment in my tenure as secretary general of the United Nations,"" UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said. ""President Putin, in the name of humanity, bring your troops back to Russia"" and don't start ""what could be the worst war since the beginning of the century.""",https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-statement-putin-launched-premeditated-war-on-ukraine-2022-2

last week, the United States inform this council and the world about what we expected to see unfold. We said that Russia would manufacture or pre pretext for an attack. We have since seen numerous false flag events staged along the line. The line of lines of contact in Donbas. We said Russia would theatrically convened emergency meetings at the highest levels of the Russian government. We all saw this on monday with the state televised Security council meeting held by President Putin, an orchestrated moment in which the Russian government decided to recognize as and I quote, independent states, unquote Sovereign Territory of Ukraine Controlled by Russia's Proxies since 2014. No one could have predicted just how dangerous inciting and far reaching President Putin's speech would be with Putin arguing for taking the world back in time to an era of empires and colonies. Finally, we said the attack would come next, that we could expect communications to be jammed, cyber attacks to shut down key Ukrainian institutions last week. We attributed to Russia denial of service attacks against Ukrainian banks. And we saw similar activity this morning targeting government sites as well. And in the last few hours we have received very concerning reports of destructive malware were placed on hundreds of computers and executed on at least some after that, we said would come the bombs and missiles. The soldiers and the tanks. Already soldiers have been deployed to the occupied region of Ukraine. Ladies and gentlemen, we are here tonight because we believe the rest is imminent now. Over the past few weeks, Russia has called our predictions hysterical. Russia said we were lying. Russia said we were supplying the world with misinformation. Russia's diplomats even laughed in the face of the human suffering. We were sounding the alarm about Russia's attack on Ukraine is tantamount to an attack on the U. N. And every member state in the chamber tonight. I said it in the General Assembly this morning and I'll say it again tonight everyday. Russians should be asking themselves right now how many Russian lives Putin will sacrifice for his cynical ambitions? Responsible Members of the Security Council will stand together and we will stand with Ukraine and we will we will do so despite a reckless, irresponsible permanent Members of the Security Council abusing its powers to attack its neighbor and subvert the U. N. And our international system.

The US and allies are planning on Thursday to trigger the ""full scale"" of the sanctions that have been discussed over the last several weeks in response to the attack, according to a senior Biden administration official.

""President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering,"" Biden said. ""Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable.""

The White House statement came in response to explosions across Ukraine, including in the capital of Kyiv. Shortly before the explosions began, Russian President Vladmir Putin announced a ""special military operation"" and called for Ukraine's ""demilitarization"" in televised remarks.

An adviser for the interior minister of Ukraine, Anton Gerashchenko, said Russia's ""invasion has begun"" with ""missile strikes on Kyiv,"" in an official WhatsApp group with journalists.

The early assessment from the US is that this is the start of the full Russian invasion, according to a senior US official familiar with the latest US intelligence. The source said the belief is that the explosions heard near Kyiv and Odessa are likely missiles, while those around Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine are likely artillery, given the proximity to the border.

Biden held a secure call with members of his national security team from the White House Wednesday evening, White House press secretary Jen Psaki tweeted . Biden was joined by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley and national security adviser Jake Sullivan, she said.

Biden also spoke by phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In a statement on the call, Biden said he briefed Zelensky ""on the steps we are taking to rally international condemnation, including tonight at the United Nations Security Council.""

""He asked me to call on the leaders of the world to speak out clearly against President Putin's flagrant aggression, and to stand with the people of Ukraine,"" Biden said.

In an address Thursday morning in Ukraine, Zelensky said he was introducing martial law across the country and urged Ukrainians to remain calm.

""No panic. We are strong. We are ready for everything,"" he said. ""We will win over everybody because we are Ukraine.""

Biden said that he planned to speak to his G-7 counterparts and would give a speech to the American people on Thursday. He said he intended to announce ""further consequences"" that the US and its allies planned to impose on Russia over ""this needless act of aggression against Ukraine and global peace and security.""

""We will also coordinate with our NATO Allies to ensure a strong, united response that deters any aggression against the Alliance,"" Biden said.

While the administration official declined to lay out specifics, the US has planned to target Russia's two largest banks, as well as other financial firms, and has prepared to deploy export controls to cut off Russian access to critical Western technology for entire Russian economic sectors.

Additional members of Putin's inner circle and their families are also likely to be targeted.

Discussions were ongoing late Wednesday evening between US and European officials about the final shape of the package, the official said. It will also be a topic of discussion at the virtual G-7 meeting that has been scheduled, the official said.

US officials remain on high alert for any cyber activity against key domestic targets including banks and critical infrastructure, the official said.

Biden's national security team plans to brief the House and Senate in separate, unclassified phone calls Thursday on the situation in Ukraine. Lawmakers from both parties roundly condemned Russia's actions in statements Wednesday and called for the US to ramp up sanctions against Moscow.

UN meeting as explosions begin

The UN Security Council held an emergency meeting on Wednesday evening in New York -- offering a remarkable split screen as the diplomats delivered speeches at the same time Putin's speech aired on Russian television and the explosions began in Ukraine. Ukraine's Ambassador to the United Nations

Sergiy Kyslytsya directly questioned Russia's representative in his speech.

""About 48 minutes ago, your President declared war on Ukraine,"" Kyslytsya said. ""You declared the war. It is the responsibility of this body to stop the war.""

US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield spoke for a second time as the UN meeting was nearing an end, stating Putin had ""delivered a message of war"" while the Security Council was meeting. She said the US would introduce a resolution in the UN on Thursday.

""At the exact time as we are gathered in the Council seeking peace, Putin delivered a message of war in total disdain for the responsibility of this council,"" Thomas-Greenfield said.

As the final speaker of the meeting, Kyslytsya turned his attention again to Russia's UN ambassador, Vasily Nebenzya, who was acting as president of the Security Council.

""I welcome the decision of some members of this council to meet as soon as possible to consider the necessary decision that would condemn the aggression that you launch on my people,"" Kyslytsya said. ""There is no purgatory for war criminals. They go straight to hell, Ambassador.""

Nebenzya shot back by claiming Moscow wasn't being aggressive against the Ukrainian people but against the ""junta"" in power in Kyiv, before hastily gaveling an end to the UN meeting.

Biden said he plans to speak to the American people Thursday after a meeting of the Group of Seven leaders. More sanctions against Russia are expected to be announced Thursday.

“The prayers of the entire world are with the people of Ukraine tonight as they suffer an unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces,” Biden said in a statement released by the White House.

“President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering. Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable,” Biden added.

Russian President Vladimir Putin announced Wednesday night that he was launching a military operation in eastern Ukraine in what many interpreted as a declaration of war on Ukraine. Reporters and witnesses on the ground reported a short time later the sounds of shelling in multiple cities.

Biden said he was monitoring the developments, and he was briefed by his national security team at the White House. He is set to meet with Group of Seven allies on Thursday morning and said in the statement he will deliver remarks on additional measures targeting Russia.

“We will also coordinate with our NATO Allies to ensure a strong, united response that deters any aggression against the Alliance,” Biden said. “Tonight, Jill and I are praying for the brave and proud people of Ukraine.”

Putin delivered remarks just before 6 a.m. Moscow time Thursday while representatives of the United Nations Security Council met to condemn Russian aggression and urge the Kremlin to choose diplomacy.

In his address, Putin announced a “special military operation” in Ukraine that would aim for the “demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine,” according to multiple reports.

Reporters on the ground in Ukraine reported hearing explosions that resembled artillery fire in the capital of Kyiv and in other cities such as Kharkiv and Kramatorsk.

Biden administration officials have warned for over a week that a Russian assault on Ukraine could come at any moment, but the threat of a large-scale military operation became more imminent in recent days as Moscow moved troops into two regions in eastern Ukraine after Putin recognized them as independent territory.

“We believe that they are now at a state of readiness where they could attack at any time,” Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters earlier Wednesday.

The Biden administration, in coordination with European allies, unveiled an initial tranche of sanctions on Moscow on Tuesday over its decision to send troops into the Donbas, with Biden describing the moves as the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The sanctions targeted Russian sovereign debt, two Russian banks and five Russian elites with links to the Kremlin. The White House has indicated that further penalties could target larger banks, including Russia’s VTB Bank, as well as other Russian oligarchs. The Biden administration has also threatened to impose export controls that would prevent Moscow from acquiring key U.S. technologies.

Some criticized the sanctions as insufficient and urged Biden to impose more stringent measures as Russia appeared intent on attacking Ukraine.

Biden has previously pledged he would not send U.S. forces to fight in Ukraine against Russia, something White House press secretary Jen Psaki firmly reiterated earlier Wednesday.

The administration has provided military aid to Ukraine, and earlier this week, the U.S. relocated troops to reinforce the Baltic States and reinforce the eastern flank of NATO in a bid to deter Russia from attacking alliance members.
