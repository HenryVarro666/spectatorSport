U.S. and Western defense officials believe Russian President Vladimir Putin had planned on a lightning campaign to seize Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, and topple Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a matter of days. Now, as his forces struggle to encircle the capital and are beset by a lack of basic supplies, the war’s outcome is becoming increasingly unclear.

“I’m fucking tired from bandaging everybody and loading their fucking limbs,” one Russian soldier fighting close to Mariupol, Ukraine, said in a message intercepted by Ukraine’s Security Service. “Never in my life have I seen so many limbs. No hand, no leg, no fucking head.”

Three weeks after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, social media around the world is replete with images of upturned Russian tanks, convoys stuck in the mud, and conscripted troops calling home to their families—who had no idea they were heading to war. Morgues in neighboring Belarus are reportedly overflowing with the dead. And on the front lines, inexperienced units, facing a stiffer-than-expected Ukrainian resistance that has blown up bridges to halt invaders and attacked their supplies, are worried about how long they can hold out.

This is not how U.S. and European officials, and particularly the Kremlin, expected the campaign to go. U.S. and Western defense officials believe Russian President Vladimir Putin had planned on a lightning campaign to seize Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, and topple Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a matter of days. Now, as his forces struggle to encircle the capital and are beset by a lack of basic supplies, the war’s outcome is becoming increasingly unclear.

“None of this has gone to plan for Russia,” said Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military with CNA, a think tank. “The plan was bewildering and based on assumptions that had no clear relationship to reality. The outcome now is indeterminate.”

Although Putin’s war has been an operational debacle, it has also proved to be a strategic catastrophe that has already seen many of the Russian president’s greatest fears become a reality. It has spurred NATO to bolster its presence in Eastern Europe and sparked the interest of previously neutral countries like Finland to join the alliance. Germany overcame its allergy to defense spending and is starting to rethink reliance on Russian energy. Western countries have poured vital military aid into Ukraine, which is closer to European Union membership than it’s been in years. Meanwhile, the Russian economy reels from unprecedented sanctions, with Western corporations, like Russia’s best and brightest, fleeing the country in a massive exodus.

The decision to invade and the kind of war meant to be fought appears to have been based on a series of bad assumptions fed by poor information. Russia made the wrong assumptions about its own military and about Ukraine’s. It also mistakenly thought that much of Ukraine would welcome Russian forces as liberators, as some parts did after the 2014 lightning annexation of the Crimean Peninsula. Putin has been highly isolated during the COVID-19 pandemic, and his rule has become increasingly authoritarian, leading many longtime observers to question the quality and accuracy of information being passed up to the Russian leader by senior Russian officials.

“If in the annals of history there is going to be a name for this war, it’s going to be called the war of underestimates,” said Lithuanian Deputy Foreign Minister Mantas Adomenas.

Military blunders have been the most evident. Moscow’s strategy has followed three distinct phases in the opening weeks of the war, said Jack Watling, a research fellow on land warfare with the Royal United Services Institute, a British think tank.

The opening attack in the early hours of Feb. 24 bore all the hallmarks of an attempted “coup de main,” a surprise attack, he said, with “the aim being to rapidly capture political centers and then control the country.” The initial attack was derailed by stiff Ukrainian resistance as well as confusion among the Russian soldiers surging across the border. Reports from captured Russian soldiers reveal they were given little advance notice that they were going to war, leaving them psychologically unprepared and short on basic supplies like food and fuel.

The invading Russian forces then switched to a period of more conventional warfare, battering major Ukrainian cities, such as Mariupol and Kharkiv, with artillery shelling. Again, Russian forces were plagued by poorly combined arms proficiency—the use of air, land, and artillery power in coordination—leaving many Russian troops exposed to Ukrainian counterattacks. Western officials estimate that around 7,000 Russian soldiers have been killed so far; Ukraine’s estimates of Russian losses are even higher, though calculating troop losses is difficult.

In recent weeks, Russian forces appear to have shifted to an attempt to encircle key cities in a bid to starve them out while limiting Russian casualties. In Mariupol on Ukraine’s southeastern coast, which has borne the brunt of this approach, hundreds of thousands of people have been taken captive in their own city. Russian troops have choked off access to the outside world while food, water, and medical aid become scarce and the victims of Russian shelling pile up in mass graves—or lay prostrate in the streets.

Three weeks into Putin’s war, Russia’s nearly 200,000-strong force—many of them conscripts—have failed to seize any major Ukrainian cities, leaving the war-torn country a mess of red splotches indicating land seized, if not yet controlled, in the eastern and southern parts of the country. A stiffer-than-expected Ukrainian resistance has “largely stalled” Putin’s offensive, the British defense intelligence agency assessed on Thursday. “Russian forces have made minimal progress on land, sea, or air in recent days, and they continue to suffer heavy losses,” the agency said in a statement.

Russian troops have also been much less mobile than Western observers expected at the outset of the war, largely sticking to roads while Ukrainian forces lie in wait. The British Ministry of Defence’s internal intelligence agency said on Wednesday that Ukrainian troops “have adeptly exploited Russia’s lack of [maneuver], frustrating the Russian advance and inflicting heavy losses on the invading forces.” A British intelligence assessment released Wednesday also indicated that Russia has been forced to divert troops to defend supply lines against Ukrainian attacks.

Instead of taking the invading Russian forces on in large, open battles, the Ukrainian military has largely stuck to urban areas, where they know the terrain. “All of the battles are small, but they’re steadily attritioning the Russian military,” Kofman said.

Although the initial surge included the greater part of Russia’s allegedly combat-ready formations, Moscow is already mustering reinforcements, including from the far east of the country (as well as mulling the use of Syrian mercenaries). On Thursday, a senior U.S. defense official said Russia’s consideration of bringing in new troops and supplies to reinforce more than 100 battalion tactical groups already in the country indicated that the Kremlin “was beginning to get concerned about the longevity” of its forces in Ukraine. One European diplomat, who spoke to Foreign Policy on condition of anonymity to give a candid military assessment, said Russia has begun to lose enough troops in combat to have a real impact on its ability to carry out offensive operations, and Russian troops on the front lines are beginning to worry about how long they can hold out.

“The Russian troops on the ground definitely think like that. The Russian generals probably think like that,” the European diplomat said. “But whether or not this is getting to Putin or whether he’s listening to this is another matter.”

Russia hasn’t fared a lot better in the skies. Originally expected to win air dominance over Ukraine’s tiny air force in a matter of days, the domain remains contested after three weeks. Although the Russian Air Force played a significant role in Syria, it largely flew unopposed in simple formations during daylight hours. “I think this highlights significant training and command and control deficiencies in the air force,” Watling said.

Ukraine could soon be getting more reinforcements too, in spite of the U.S. Defense Department’s decision to nix a Polish plan to transfer dozens of Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets to a U.S. air base in Germany for Ukrainian pilots to pick up. At a press conference on Thursday alongside U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Slovakian Defense Minister Jaroslav Naj said his country was in talks with U.S. and Ukrainian officials to provide Russian-made S-300 air defense batteries to Ukraine, provided that NATO members could replace their own air defenses.

The Kremlin is also getting a different kind of combat from Ukraine than they anticipated. A senior Israeli official, speaking to reporters earlier this week, said Putin believed that Russian forces would be fighting a 20th-century-style force-on-force conflict against Ukrainian formations but have been hit instead with small-unit ambushes that have halted their advance using anti-tank weapons from the West, like the U.S. Javelin and British next-generation light anti-tank weapon rocket systems.

“Logistically, something doesn’t work,” the Israeli official said, citing Russia’s 40-mile convoy of military vehicles and supplies that stalled north of Kyiv before U.S. defense officials and satellite imagery detected groupings of vehicles seeking cover from Ukrainian hit-and-run attacks in tree lines and industrial zones.

Even though military officials anticipated that Ukraine’s relatively flat terrain might be a boon to Russian invaders, intelligence analysts believe Ukraine’s much smaller military has found ways to use it to their advantage. Defenders destroyed a bridge in Irpin, outside of Kyiv, to halt the 40-mile-long convoy, for example; reservoirs were also opened, turning tank country into swampland.

Still significant danger remains in the east, with U.S. defense officials insistent that Russia is trying to encircle Ukrainian troops on the front lines in the Donbass from the north and the south and cut them off before they can defend Kyiv. Russia took the town of Izyum, southeast of Kharkiv, an indication that the military could seek to push farther south. Russian forces have pounded the southeast as well.

As the Ukrainian military plays for time and holds off the Russian advance, Zelensky is skillfully lobbying Western countries for more military aid. In addresses to U.S. Congress as well as British and German parliaments, Zelensky has invoked memories of all three countries’ experiences with World War II in a bid to spur them to further action. “I address all of you who heard politicians say every year ‘never again,’ but I can see these words are worth nothing. Now, our whole nation is being exterminated in Europe. Why?” Zelensky asked the German Bundestag on Thursday.

Having bungled its initial attack, the next phase of the war rests on whether Moscow can solve its logistics challenges and stabilize its troop losses while Ukraine is supplied with more and better arms from the West.

“You can see them being bled out over a long period of time,” Watling said. “The second way that this could go is that the Russians unscramble their logistics over the next couple of weeks, start to prioritize their axis of advance, close off key cities, and suck up the punishment until they starve them out. In which case, you can see a scenario in which, in six months, they have functionally taken over eastern Ukraine.”",https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/03/18/russia-putin-ukraine-war-three-weeks/

On Day 23 of the war, Russian troops did not make any significant gains on any front on Thursday. Ukrainian counterattacks, particularly in the Kyiv area, inflicted “heavy casualties” on the Kremlin’s forces, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW).

Incessant Ukrainian counterattacks are forcing Russia to divert a large number of troops to defend their own supply lines, said the United Kingdom’s Defence Ministry in its daily update. “This is severely limiting Russia’s offensive potential.”

“Reluctance to maneuver cross-country, lack of control of the air and limited bridging capabilities are preventing Russia from effectively resupplying their forward troops with even basic essentials such as food and fuel,” added the report.

Ukrainian forces continued to repel Russian efforts to encircle Kyiv and the southern city of Mykolaiv. But the cities of Kharkiv, Chernihov, Sumy and Mariupol are encircled and under constant shelling.

In the west, the mayor of Lviv said that several missiles had struck near the airport before dawn on Friday. A plume of smoke could be seen in the area, reported EL PAÍS correspondent Luis de Vega. Lviv, a city of 700,000 residents, is located near the border with Poland and until now it had been considered a safe place for Ukrainians fleeing other parts of the country.

In the south, some reserve forces of the Russian naval fleet that is stationed near the port city of Odessa were deployed to Mariupol in what appears to be an effort to support the ongoing assault there, said the ISW.

In the east, Russia said on Thursday that separatist forces in the Donbas region captured several towns after making limited territorial gains.

March 17 | The Russian invasion has stalled

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has “largely stalled on all fronts,” according to the United Kingdom Defense Ministry’s latest intelligence report. Moscow’s forces have made minimal progress on land, sea and air in recent days and continue to suffer heavy losses, said the report. “Ukrainian resistance remains staunch and well coordinated. The vast majority of Ukrainian territory, including all major cities, remains in Ukrainian hands.”

Russian troops failed to make any progress on any of their four fronts: the attempt to encircle the capital Kyiv, the assault on Kharkiv, the advance on Donetsk and the capture of Mariupol. There were also no significant gains in the push west from Kherson.

Russian troops conducted several unsuccessful attacks northwest of Kyiv on Wednesday, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). There were no major ground operations in Chernihiv, Sumy or Kharkov, three cities that the Russian army is attempting to encircle.

In the meantime, Russian forces continued to pound civilian targets. According to Ukrainian authorities, a theater in Mariupol that was being used as a shelter was struck on Wednesday, and at least 10 people died while lining up for bread in Chernihiv. Before dawn on Thursday emergency services also reported an attack against a residential building in Kyiv.

The United States estimates that 7,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in Ukraine in these past three weeks, according to information published by The New York Times. There could be an additional 14,000 to 21,000 injured out of a total of 150,000 troops, according to the Pentagon’s calculations. This casualty rate could make it difficult for combat units to carry out their tasks.

March 16 | Advances in the Kherson province

The Russian advance in Ukraine has been slowing for several days now when compared to the early stages of the offensive. The Russian troops have not carried out simultaneous attacks on the different fronts since March 4, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). The biggest Russian advances in the last day were in the south of the country, where Russian troops have been mounting a series of attacks from Kherson, toward Zaporizhzhia.

In the south, the Russian Defense Ministry stated on Tuesday that it had taken control of the Kherson province, although the ISW limited that advance to certain areas in the northeast of that area. This move could be aimed at surrounding Zaporizhzhia, something that seems unlikely, at least until this front can receive reinforcements from the Russian troops that are currently trying to force the surrender of Mariupol, in the east of the country.

Russian troops are encountering difficulties in replacing the losses that they are suffering, according to British intelligence services. This difficulty is impeding the invading troops from consolidating positions that they have secured as well as from carrying out multiple offensive operations, given the Ukrainian resistance.

In the east, the outskirts of Mariupol – which is located on the coast of the Sea of Azov – have suffered constant Russian air and artillery attacks, both in residential areas and on civil infrastructure. The ISW believes that the surrender of Mariupol will be the next turning point in the conflict, given that the Ukrainian defenders of the city are likely to be left without ammunition or drinking water in “the near future.”

The capture of this city, which has been under siege practically since the start of the offensive, would free up Russian troops that the army could send to the east of Zaporizhzhia and toward the area of the Ukrainian coast that Russia is yet to control: Odessa. This port city was bombed last night by a number of Russian ships, according to Anton Yuriiovych, an advisor at the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs.

On the outskirts of Kyiv, the Russian troops launched a number of attacks on different areas in the northwest of the capital, while on the eastern flank of the city, the combat units continued to receive reinforcements.

March 15 | Russian troops make no progress towards Kyiv

There were no significant changes to the situation on the ground. Russian forces launched several attacks northwest of the capital, Kyiv, and unsuccessfully attempted to bridge the Irpin river, according to the ISW.

The Russian army did not advance east of Kyiv and might be lacking sufficient troops to renew the offensive on that front for a few days. According to Rochan Consulting, an independent defense consulting firm, Russian soldiers were held back by Ukrainian forces in Brovary, northeast of the capital.

Airstrikes on Kyiv continued on Monday, when a projectile hit a residential building in the northern neighborhood of Obolon. There were more strikes on Tuesday and two residential buildings in the districts of Podilsk (northwest) and Osokorky (southeast) were reportedly hit, according to Ukrainian emergency services.

In southern Ukraine, Russian troops resumed their attacks from Kherson toward Mykolaiv but Ukrainian forces were able to contain them, according to the ISW.

In recent days, Ukrainian citizens have staged public protests in Kherson, Melitopol and Berdiansk against the Russian occupation. According to the UK Defense Ministry, Russia may be trying to organize a “referendum” in Kherson in a bid to legitimize the area as a “separatist republic” similar to Donetsk or Luhansk, in eastern Ukraine, which Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized as republics shortly before launching the invasion.

March 14 | Russia secures positions in the Donbas region

The Russian army conducted few ground offensives on Sunday save for the Donbas region, where it secured new positions in Donetsk and Luhansk, according to the latest report by the ISW. Operations were renewed on Monday, however, when Ukrainian emergency services reported that two people were killed in an airstrike against a residential building northwest of the capital, Kyiv.

In the east, Moscow’s forces launched several attacks in the area extending north of the besieged city of Mariupol. The Ukrainian army said the Russians have captured several towns but that their own forces were able to repel an offensive in Volnovaja, a town of 21,000 residents located between the Sea of Azov and the city of Donetsk, around 40 miles (65 km) from Mariupol. Volnovaja has been hard hit by airstrikes in recent days.

In the south, the British Defense Ministry said that Russia has established a distant blockade of Ukraine’s Black Sea coast, thereby isolating the country from international maritime trade. Russian naval forces are continuing to carry out missile strikes against targets in Ukraine, said the ministry in its latest intelligence update. “Russia has already conducted one amphibious landing in the Sea of Azov and could look to conduct further such operations in the coming weeks,” said the report.

In the west, there were Russian airstrikes against military facilities near the border with Poland.

March 13 | Airstrikes hit western Ukraine

Russian airstrikes hit targets around 15 miles (25 km) from the border with Poland, which is a member of the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Ukrainian authorities said Russia launched around 30 missiles against a military base in Yavoriv, near Lviv, a major city in western Ukraine. Following the Friday attacks on Ivano-Frankivsk and Lutsk, this represents the third Russian offensive in an area that up until this weekend had been deemed relatively safe for Ukrainians fleeing the country as well as for the delivery of Western resources to the local army.

Around Kyiv, Russian troops renewed their attacks with the goal of encircling the city. The New York Times reported on street-by-street battles in suburbs such as Irpin, west of the capital.

Even so, the Russian army did not appear to have gained new territory. Logistical problems, growing losses and Ukrainian counter-attacks have been slowing down Russian forces’ advance, according to the ISW. This would explain why they have not launched a major attack on Kyiv in recent days, although new troops appeared to be deploying on this front.

There was no progress towards Kyiv from other directions, either. Russian forces have for days been trying to capture Chernihiv (north). Near Sumy (northeast), Ukrainian forces said they had attacked and destroyed several Russian vehicles. In Kharkiv (east), the second largest city in the country, the front had barely moved while the fighting and the Russian airstrikes continued.

In the south, Ukrainian authorities said Russian troops have captured suburbs east of Mariupol, which has been under intense attack for days. It is here that Russian bombs destroyed a hospital’s maternity ward. According to the ISW, the Kremlin’s goal is not to march into the city with its troops, but to keep up the airstrikes and isolate the city in order to force its citizens to surrender. Ukraine said that a convoy carrying 90 tons of food and medicine is already on its way to Mariupol.

March 12 | The Russians are massing forces to encircle Kyiv

Russian troops have made no progress for a week. In the last 48 hours they tested the Ukrainian defenses west of Kyiv without success. They failed to take Kharkiv, made no progress on their path towards Mykolaiv or Zaporizhzhia, and same near Donetsk and Luhansk, according to the ISW.

In Kyiv, Putin’s troops continued to try to encircle the city, attacking on three flanks. The fighting continued in the northwest, with Russian soldiers around 15 miles from the city center, according to a British Defense Ministry intelligence report from Saturday. The vehicles in the enormous convoy that was detected 10 days ago appear to have dispersed, either to surround Kyiv or to be less vulnerable to Ukrainian attacks.

The Russians are also approaching Kyiv from the east, around Brovary. However, according to the ISW, their forces have not secured new territory and part of the contingent appears to have fallen back to defend against Ukrainian counterattacks in the Sumy region.

The cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol remain under siege and air bombardments. On Friday, Ukrainian authorities reported bombing in Mykolaiv.

In the south, Ukrainian forces halted Russian advances from Crimea, in the north and the west. Russian forces have been dealing with growing problems with supplies and troop morale, according to the ISW.

March 11 | “Limited” progress and new airstrikes

Russian troops have been making “limited” progress in Ukraine in recent days, according to British Defense Ministry intelligence reports. The invading ground forces have been dealing with logistical problems and with “strong Ukrainian resistance.” This pushback throughout the north of the country, from eastern Kyiv to the city of Sumy, continues to disrupt the Russian army’s efforts to move more troops towards Kyiv in order to encircle the city, according to the ISW.

On the 16th day of fighting, British intelligence reports said it was “highly unlikely that Russia has achieved the objectives outlined in its pre-invasion plan.” But Moscow is still expected to reorganize its forces for a renewed offensive, probably including attacks against the capital.

In eastern Ukraine, Russian troops bombed civilian areas in Dnipro, a city that had so far not come under attack, said Ukrainian emergency services. In the northwest, Russia claimed to have bombed and rendered inoperative the airbases of Ivano-Frankivsk and Lutsk. Local authorities in the latter municipality, which is near the Polish border, said they heard explosions during the night. Mikhaílo Podoliak, an advisor to the president of Ukraine, confirmed attacks on all three cities.

Meanwhile, Russian troops continued to put pressure on besieged cities like Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol. Ukrainian resistance in these enclaves is forcing Russia to devote more resources to them, slowing down their advance to other parts of the country, said the United Kingdom. The Russian Defense Ministry on Friday announced it will declare a ceasefire in the capital and in those four cities. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an overnight address that around 40,000 people had been evacuated on Thursday via humanitarian corridors.

March 10 | Russian troops test Kyiv’s defenses

Russian troops did not make significant progress. According to the British Defense Ministry intelligence reports, there was a notable drop in air operations thanks to an efficient Ukrainian defense.

In the north, Russian troops renewed their attempt to encircle Kyiv, and on Wednesday they tested the Ukrainian defenses at several points, as confirmed by the ISW and Rochan Consulting. According to Ukrainian information gathered on Tuesday, five Russian battalions launched an attack near Bucha, around 15 miles northwest of Kyiv. Four more battalions reportedly advanced on Yasnohorodka, 23 miles southwest of the capital’s center, in a bid to reach Kyiv from that direction as well. British intelligence on Thursday provided an update on a convoy of Russian vehicles first spotted northwest of Kyiv a few days ago, and which has made little progress over the past week; the convoy has reportedly suffered continuous losses.

Russian forces are besieging five cities, according to British intelligence reports: Chernihiv, Sumy, Konotop, Kharkiv and Mariupol. Hundreds of thousands of people are trapped in these locations without food, water, electricity or medicines.

After several unsuccessful attempts to establish a safe route to evacuate residents from Mariupol, Ukraine and Russia held another meeting on Thursday, but it ended without agreement. “Ukraine has proposed a humanitarian corridor to and from Mariupol and a ceasefire of at least one day to address the humanitarian problems of civilians. The Russian side did not agree. I am willing to continue negotiations,” said Ukraine‘s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba.

Satellite images published on Thursday by the private US company Maxar Technologies show the damage caused by Russia’s bombardment of key infrastructure in Mariupol, which has been in a critical situation for days.

March 9 | Few advances and new bombings

The Russian army continued to bomb Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol, some of Ukraine’s main cities, as it prepared for a siege of Kyiv.

The humanitarian crisis led both sides to agree to a 12-hour ceasefire starting early on Wednesday to provide some relief for the hundreds of thousands of people trapped in cities under attack. Ukrainian authorities said that they were only able to carry out evacuations in Sumy and Energodar.

In the south, Russian troops were apparently trying to reach Odessa, the main port on the Black Sea. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on social media that Russia has bombed a children’s hospital in Mariupol, a city where the situation is “apocalyptic” according to the Red Cross. The hospital has been destroyed, as seen in footage verified by this newspaper, and local authorities said that 17 people have been injured.

Near the capital, the most active front was in Irpin, in the western outskirts of Kyiv, where civilians have been hit by shelling in recent days. Russian troops did not make any gains, but they were reportedly concentrating their forces ahead of new operations. All analysts agree that Russia’s goal is to encircle Kyiv and force it to surrender.

In northeastern Ukraine, there was fighting in Chernihiv and in Sumy, two cities from which Russian troops are trying to create a communication line to Kyiv. In the east, British Defense Ministry intelligence reports talked about shelling in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second biggest city. From here, it is believed that Russian forces are seeking to connect with the troops currently deployed in the Donetsk and Donbas regions to create a large front in this part of the country.

March 8 | Supplies and reinforcements for the siege

Russian troop movement around Kyiv has several goals: surrounding the capital from several sides, accumulating supplies and reinforcements, and cutting off the city’s links to the outside world, according to the ISW. The Kremlin is reportedly massing tanks and men on two flanks: the northwest one, where it is trying to gain control of the cities of Irpin, 15 miles from the capital, and Bucha, three miles further north. On the eastern flank, the target is Brovary, a small town on the outskirts of Kyiv. In both cases, Russian soldiers are running into resistance from Ukrainians.

Shelling has also been reported in the last two days around 59 miles south of the capital, in the city of Bila Tserkva. This could be an attempt to reach Kyiv from a front where there was little activity in previous days, according to the Rochan Institute and The Guardian.

Irpin, a dormitory town of around 60,000 residents, has become a containment wall against Russia’s advance west of the capital. It was targeted for bombing at the beginning of the invasion and it has been the scene of fighting over the past week.

Russian soldiers may be using “siege-and-starve” tactics on the city, using a strategy that was already used in Syria, according to the ISW. The goal is to get the population to surrender by preventing water and food from coming in, said Ukrainian authorities.

There are images of Russian tanks in a neighborhood near the Bucha River. @Militarylandnet.

Last Sunday, images of civilians killed by artillery fire as they were trying to flee Irpin created greater pressure for humanitarian corridors to evacuate people and bring in supplies. Attempts at establishing safe passages failed on Monday, but were established on Tuesday in Sumy and Irpin. Around 150 people had fled the latter city in the early morning hours, according to local authorities.

In the east, fighting continued in major cities such as Kharkiv and Sumy, where a bomb attack killed at least 10 people according to Ukrainian authorities. The city of Mariupol is reportedly surrounded by Russian troops.

In the south, a bloody battle took place on Monday for control over the city of Mykolaiv, according to The New York Times. This is a key port on the Black Sea and would help Moscow prepare its attack on Odessa. If it manages to take both cities, Russia will have almost total control over the country’s access to the sea.

Operational information at 24.00

The twenty-second day of the heroic resistance of the Ukrainian people to the russian military invasion continues.

russian occupation forces continue offensive operation against Ukraine. The strategic goals of defeating groups of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, reaching the administrative borders of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, and establishing control over the left-bank part of Ukraine have not been met.

The Command of the Armed Forces of the russian federation continues to take measures to make up for the loss of personnel at the expense of foreigners. According to available information, the russian occupiers have already picked up close

1,000 volunteers from the so-called army of Bashar al-Assad and Hezbollah.

The main requirement for foreign fighters is the experience of fighting in the city. At the same time, according to available information, the above-mentioned militants do not intend to take part in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine, but to use ""business trips"" as opportunities to get to European countries.

The enemy did not carry out offensive operations in the Volyn direction. He continued to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border by units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus. There is a high probability of provocations by the special services of the russian federation.

The enemy did not carry out active offensive operations in the Polissya direction, the main efforts of the occupiers were focused on maintaining the previously occupied borders and carrying out measures to prepare for a possible attack on Kyiv. At the same time, the losses inflicted on the occupiers by Ukrainian defenders, the low morale and psychological condition of privates and sergeants, as well as the lack of experienced commanders of tactical units make it impossible to resume offensive operations in the near future.

In the northern direction, the enemy is trying to stay on certain borders, restore the combat capability of units and replenish supplies. The occupiers continue to partially blockade the city of Chernihiv and carry out artillery shelling of the city.

In the direction of Brovary, the enemy did not conduct active hostilities.

In the area of ​​the city of Brovary, the occupiers periodically carry out artillery shelling of the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

In the Slobozhansky direction, in order to resume offensive operations on the cities of Sumy and Kharkiv, the occupiers are trying to replenish stocks of ammunition and fuel, and oil and are forced to use the accumulated human reserves prematurely. In the direction of the city of Izyum, the enemy is trying to resume offensive operations.

In the Luhansk and Donetsk directions, the enemy focused its main efforts on preparing for the attack on Severodonetsk and the encirclement of Mariupol.

The enemy did not take active action in the Pivdennobuzsky direction. He moved on to the defense and engineering of the occupied frontiers. He tried to regroup and replenish stocks.

The occupiers continue to try to detect and destroy the air defense system along the Black Sea coast.

In the Black Sea, the enemy is trying to conduct demonstrations.

Defence Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine

Some Syrian Mercenaries See Participation in Russian-Ukrainian War as a Chance for Further Desertion and Illegal Migration to EU Countries.

On March 15, 150 mercenaries were sent to Russia from the Khmeimim military base (Syrian Arab Republic) to take part in hostilities against Ukraine.

According to Ukraine's military intelligence, weapons, military equipment and other resources are planned to be transferred from Syria to Russia and Belarus in the near future to support the Russian fascist forces. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has promised to provide Russia with 40,000 militants for the war in Ukraine.

During the recruitment, the mercenaries are promised that they will perform exclusively police functions to restore order in the occupied territories, that is, purely police functions. But more recently, information about direct participation in hostilities against the Ukrainian army has begun to spread among mercenaries. This significantly reduced the ""fighting spirit"" of the Syrians.

In addition, more than 30 militants, who were wounded in battles against the Ukraine’s defenders, have recently arrived at the Khmeimim military base from russia. This fact has negatively affected the moral and psychological condition of other mercenaries and has led to the refusal of some of them to take part in hostilities. Cases of self-mutilation have even been fixed among Syrian militants. Some mercenaries see sending to russia and belarus as a chance for further desertion and illegal migration to EU countries.

Russia's aggressor army is shooting civilians every day, cynically striking peaceful inhabitants and civilian buildings.

Russian troops covered artillery fire on civilians who were on the street in the center of Chernihiv. According to the available data, there are 4 dead, including US citizen James Whitney Hill.

According to the results of the night shelling of the city of Merefa in the Kharkiv region 21 people died, 25 were injured, debris are still being dismantled. The school, the house of culture and private houses were destroyed.

During the evacuation of people in the Bucha district in the Kyiv region, the occupiers fired at the evacuation columns with tanks. One policeman was killed and another was injured. The same situation occurred in Irpen, when a hail shell hit a police car.

Heavy artillery shelling of residential buildings in the village of Novi Petrivtsi, Kyiv region, killed a two-year-old child and injured four grownups. As a result of the shelling, a high-rise building was destroyed and neighboring houses were damaged.

In Severodonetsk, Luhansk region, the occupiers fired on a shelter for mothers with children, where a large number of them were staying. Fortunately, they were not injured.

Every hour, the troops of the aggressor country commit war crimes and crimes against humanity on the territory of Ukraine, ignoring the norms of all four Geneva Conventions of 1949.

“I call on the international community to take decisive action to deter the aggression of the Russian Federation and to force the aggressor country to immediately cease hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.

I appeal to NATO member states, every day the delay in closing the skies over Ukraine takes dozens of civilian lives, children die every day! This must finally be stopped!” stressed Denisova.

POLICY

Adviser to the Head of the Office of the President

Immediate ceasefire and withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory of Ukraine are among the key aspects of a peace agreement that could be signed as a result of negotiations with Russia to end the war against Ukraine. But strategically, Ukraine wants to have a concrete mechanism that will guarantee its security in the future.

This was stated by Adviser to the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Mykhailo Podolyak in an interview for WP Wiadomości.

“Immediate ceasefire and immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine is one of the key aspects of the peace agreement. There is no other way. However, the negotiations are a large-scale process in which not only Russia and Ukraine are involved. Our partners also take an indirect part. Because we don't just have to sign a treaty. We want to develop a concrete mechanism that will guarantee our security in the future,"" underlined the Adviser to the Head of the President's Office.

Mykhailo Podolyak noted that the Ukrainian and Russian delegations are still defending their positions at the talks, so it may take some time to agree on the disputed issues. Unfortunately, the process is not as fast as we would like it to be.

""During this time, we must move closer to a peace agreement. First of all, taking into account the interests of Ukraine, which has suffered enormous destruction by the Russian Federation,"" he stressed.

The Adviser to the Head of the President's Office is convinced that after the signing of such an agreement, Russia will have no choice but to begin the immediate withdrawal of its armed forces from Ukraine.

""After the signing of the treaty, the Vienna Convention will enter into force for both parties. It makes it clear that a peace treaty can be annulled if the belligerent states do not withdraw their troops from the enemy’s territory. Therefore, any attempts to keep Russian soldiers on Ukrainian land will be legally groundless,"" he explained.

Mykhailo Podoyak noted that in order to prevent Russia’s another violation of international law and treaties, Ukraine wants to spell out in detail a specific plan for the withdrawal of Russian troops, legally verify it and gain the support of international partners.

""Besides, it is foreign states that will guarantee the fulfillment of conditions and Ukraine’s security in the future. This will be a document that describes in detail the procedure in case of repeated aggression by Russia. This is an innovative formula authored by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which can become the basis for creating a completely new security system in Europe,"" said the Adviser to the Head of the President's Office.

In his opinion, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has shown that the entire architecture of European security must be revised. That is why Ukraine wants to end this war with a new coalition, so powerful that it will stop Russia if it wants to attack someone again.

Theoretically, now is the time to speak publicly about all aspects of modern challenges and openly assess the level of modern security contours. Do they cope with these challenges? Can they protect European cities from the barbaric bombings that Ukraine is experiencing today? Will Europe be able to finally get rid of the fear of the Russian Federation? It is obvious that the countries that will be the new guarantors of security will undertake certain commitments. ""In the future, on the basis of today's global crisis, a completely new alliance will be created, which will ensure the security of the whole of Europe,"" stressed Podolyak.

The Adviser to the Head of the President's Office stated that Ukraine would not agree to compromises that could damage its interests in any way. And it is not for the sake of such compromises that Ukrainians are now dying on the battlefields willing to fight to the end.

""We are not Russia. We know how and will continue to have a dialogue with our society. And we always hear our society. Unlike Russia, we can discuss any issues that should have been discussed long ago, but we will not agree to any ultimatum,"" he said.

Mykhailo Podolyak noted that despite the complexity of this process, Ukraine must hold negotiations with Russia, as no one else wants to fight together with Ukrainians. Negotiations during the war are just another frontline.

The categorical refusal is the alleged reaction of the terrorist country to the ban on the continuation of any hostilities on the territory of Ukraine by the International Court of Justice.

Today, the press secretary of the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Peskov said that Russia is not going to comply with the decision of the International Court of Justice.

This is the official position of the aggressor country to continue the war with Ukraine.

Mass shelling, aerial bombardment of Mariupol, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Izyum, dozens and hundreds of towns and villages in Kyiv, Sumy, Luhansk, Donetsk, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv regions will continue.

“All of Ukraine is on fire and in the blood of peaceful Ukrainians, our children because of the ambitions of the president of the Russian Federation and his army of terrorists.

The world should not stand aside! After all, Russia's aggression plans go far beyond the territory of Ukraine!

The aggressor state must be stopped to save lives of millions of our children.

I call on the international community to press all the levers to force Russia to cease hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.” stressed Denisova.

Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine

Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak held an online conference with representatives of the world's leading investment companies.

He said that the Russian army continues to bomb Ukrainian cities, killing civilians and children.

“Today the whole world is talking about the terrible situation in Mariupol. The situation is not much better in Kharkiv, in the settlements around Kyiv. But Ukraine will never give up, will never give up its independence. And the army of a non-NATO country has stopped and continues to fight one of the largest armies in the world,” stressed Yermak.

Andriy Yermak also noted that after the end of the war, Ukrainians will rebuild their beautiful country very quickly. To this end, Ukraine plans to raise funds from international partners, as well as reparations to be paid by the Russian Federation.

He called on businesses to invest in the purchase of military bonds of the Ukrainian government, and responsible companies that have already left or are leaving Russia - to refocus on Ukraine in the future. Also, according to the Head of the Office of the President, it would be appropriate to consider the creation of special funds or individual programs for the restoration and reconstruction of Ukraine.

“The best answer to the inhumane acts we see now in our country will be the appearance of the most modern buildings and enterprises on the site of destroyed buildings, where Ukrainians will be able to work. And we hope that thanks to this, people who are now forced to leave Ukraine will quickly return to their homeland,” underlined Yermak.",https://smallwarsjournal.com/blog/ukraine-war-bulletin-march-17-600mp-est

Russia says it has struck what it described as a factory in Kyiv that makes and repairs anti-ship missiles, in apparent retaliation to the sinking of its Black Sea flagship missile cruiser, the Moskva.

Russia acknowledged that the ship had sunk late on Thursday, but won’t confirm Ukraine’s claim that it was hit by missiles. Instead it says an unexplained fire caused ammunition to explode, and that the boat capsized “in choppy seas” while being towed to port. Read more: what we know and don’t know about the sinking of the Moskva.

The Moskva was the pride of Russia’s Black Sea naval fleet and the most prestigious vessel involved in the war in Ukraine, making it both a symbolic and military target.

The Russian navy has launched cruise missiles into Ukraine and its activities in the Black Sea are crucial to supporting land operations in the south of the country, where it is battling to seize full control of the port of Mariupol.

Ukraine said on Friday that for the first time since the start of its invasion, Russia used long-range bombers to attack the city, where surrounded Ukrainian forces are still holding out in the Azovstal iron and steelworks.

On Thursday, Russia said it would deploy nuclear weapons to the Baltic if Finland and Sweden joined Nato.

What happened in first three weeks of the invasion?

How did we get here?

In the months before its invasion Russia had deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine.

Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions.

The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded.

The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine.

What do we know about Russia’s deployments?

Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Russia’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine.

An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion.

Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew.

Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea.

The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February.

Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations.

How do the militaries compare?

Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland.

What is the historical context?

In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war.

A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement.

Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war.

What was the role of Nord Stream 2?

On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics.

First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price.

Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/russias-war-in-ukraine-complete-guide-in-maps-video-and-pictures
