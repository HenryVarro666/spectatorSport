Ukraine’s state power company, Energoatom, said the pullout at Chernobyl came after soldiers received ""significant doses” of radiation from digging trenches in the forest in the exclusion zone around the closed plant. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it could not independently confirm the exposure claim.

In what would be the first attack of its kind, if confirmed, the governor of Russia's Belgorod region accused Ukraine of flying helicopter gunships across the border on Friday morning and striking an oil depot.

The depot run by Russian energy giant Rosneft is located about 35 kilometers (21 miles) north of the Ukraine-Russia border. The helicopter attack set the facility ablaze, and two people were injured, according to a Telegram post by Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov.

""The fire at the oil depot occurred as a result of an airstrike from two helicopters of the armed forces of Ukraine, which entered the territory of Russia at a low altitude,” the governor wrote on the messaging app.

It was not immediately possible to verify the claim or images that were circulating on social media of the alleged attack. Some 170 personnel were trying to put out the blaze, according to Russia's emergencies ministry. All law enforcement agencies in the Kursk region have been put on high alert due to the events in Belgorod, according to media reports.

Elsewhere, Ukrainian forces have retaken the villages of Sloboda and Lukashivka, which are south of the besieged northern city of Chernihiv and located along one of the main supply routes between the city and Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, according to Britain's Defense Ministry.

Ukrainian forces said they have recaptured 11 settlements in the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson in the past few days. During the advance in the north of the region, they also came across abandoned Russian military equipment, including T-64 tanks, Ukraine's Defense Ministry said.

According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, units of the Ukrainian forces have regained control over the settlements of Orlove, Zahradivka and Kochubeyivka.

Ukraine has also continued to make successful but limited counterattacks to the east and northeast of Kyiv.

Russian forces have subjected both Chernihiv and Kyiv to continued air and ground-launched missile strikes despite Moscow officials saying Tuesday they planned to reduce military activity in those areas.

Western officials said there were growing indications Russia was using its talk of de-escalation in Ukraine as cover to regroup, resupply its forces and redeploy them for a stepped up offensive in the eastern part of the country.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that Russian withdrawals from the north and center of the country were just a military tactic to build up strength for new attacks in the southeast.

""We know their intentions,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation. ""We know that they are moving away from those areas where we hit them in order to focus on other, very important ones where it may be difficult for us.”

""There will be battles ahead,” he added.

Ukrainian and Russian negotiators planned to resume talks via video on Friday, five weeks into a conflict that has left thousands dead and driven more than 4 million Ukrainians away. There seems little faith that the two sides would resolve the conflict any time soon.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said conditions weren’t yet ""ripe” for a cease-fire and he wasn’t ready for a meeting with Zelenskyy until the negotiators do more work, Italian Premier Mario Draghi said after a Thursday telephone conversation with the Russian leader.

Following a plea from Zelenskyy when he addressed the Australian parliament on Thursday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that his country would send mine-resistant armored personnel carriers to Ukraine.

He said Friday that the four-wheel-drive Bushmaster armored vehicles, specifically requested by Zelenskyy, would be flown to Europe but did not say how many would be delivered or when.

""We’re not just sending our prayers, we are sending our guns, we’re sending our munitions, we’re sending our humanitarian aid, we’re sending all of this, our body armor, all of these things, and we’re going to be sending our armored vehicles, our Bushmasters, as well,” Morrison said.

In the encircled strategic port city of Mariupol, Russian forces on Thursday blocked a convoy of 45 buses attempting to evacuate people after the Russian military agreed to a limited cease-fire in the area. Only 631 people were able to get out of the city in private cars, according to the Ukrainian government.

Russian forces also seized 14 tons of food and medical supplies in a dozen buses that were trying to make it to Mariupol, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said.

The city has been the scene of some of the worst suffering of the war. Tens of thousands of residents managed to get out in the past few weeks through humanitarian corridors, reducing the population from a prewar 430,000 to an estimated 100,000 by last week. But continued Russian attacks have repeatedly thwarted aid and evacuation convoys.

An aide to the mayor of Mariupol said on Friday the besieged southern Ukrainian city remained closed for anyone trying to enter and was ""very dangerous"" for anyone trying to leave. Petro Andryushchenko said Russian forces had since Thursday been preventing even the smallest amount of humanitarian supplies from reaching trapped residents, making clear a planned ""humanitarian corridor"" had not been opened.

""The city remains closed to entry and very dangerous to exit with personal transport,"" he said on the Telegram messaging app. ""In addition, since yesterday the occupiers have categorically not allowed any humanitarian aid – even in small quantities – into the city.""

The Mariupol mayor's office estimates 5,000 civilians have been killed in the siege of the city. The mayor put the number of civilians in the city earlier this week at up to 170,000.

The IAEA said it had been informed by Ukraine that the Russian forces at Chernobyl had transferred control of the site of the world’s worst nuclear disaster to the Ukrainians in writing. The last Russian troops left Chernobyl early Friday, the Ukrainian government agency responsible for the exclusion zone said.

Energoatom gave no details on the condition of the soldiers it said were exposed to radiation and did not say how many were affected. There was no immediate comment from the Kremlin, and the IAEA said it was seeking more information.

Russian forces seized the Chernobyl site in the opening stages of the Feb. 24 invasion, raising fears that they would cause damage or disruption that could spread radiation. The workforce at the site oversees the safe storage of spent fuel rods and the concrete-entombed ruins of the reactor that exploded in 1986.

Edwin Lyman, a nuclear expert with the U.S.-based Union of Concerned Scientists, said it ""seems unlikely” a large number of troops would develop severe radiation illness, but it was impossible to know for sure without more details.

IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi was in the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad on Friday for talks with senior officials there about nuclear issues in Ukraine.

In addition to concerns about Chernobyl, nine of Ukraine's 15 operational reactors are currently in use, including two at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhya facility, the IAEA said.

Early this week, the Russians said they would significantly scale back military operations in areas around Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv to increase trust between the two sides and help negotiations along.

But in the Kyiv suburbs, regional governor Oleksandr Palviuk said on social media Thursday that Russian forces shelled Irpin and Makariv and that there were battles around Hostomel. Pavliuk said there were Ukrainian counterattacks and some Russian withdrawals around the suburb of Brovary to the east.

""We are observing the movement of joint (Russian) vehicle columns of various quantities,"" Pavliuk wrote on the Telegram messaging app Friday. He said Russian forces had left the village of Hostomel, which is next to an important, but was digging in at the town of Bucha, according to remarks carried by Reuters.

At a Ukrainian military checkpoint outside Kyiv, soldiers and officers said they don’t believe Russian forces have given up on the capital.

""What does it mean, significantly scaling down combat actions in the Kyiv and Chernihiv areas?” asked Brig. Gen. Valeriy Embakov. ""Does it mean there will be 100 missiles instead of 200 missiles launched on Kyiv or something else?”

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said intelligence indicates Russia is not scaling back its military operations in Ukraine but is instead trying to regroup, resupply its forces and reinforce its offensive in the Donbas.

""Russia has repeatedly lied about its intentions,” Stoltenberg said. At the same time, he said, pressure is being kept up on Kyiv and other cities, and ""we can expect additional offensive actions bringing even more suffering.”

Donbass is the predominantly Russian-speaking industrial region where Moscow-backed separatists have been battling Ukrainian forces since 2014. In the past few days, the Kremlin, in a seeming shift in its war aims, said that its ""main goal” now is gaining control of Donbass, which consists of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, including Mariupol.",https://www.dailysabah.com/world/europe/ukraine-liberates-russian-held-settlements-ahead-of-peace-talks

Photographer, EMERCOM of Russia/TASS photo caption, Nearly 200 firefighters put out fire at oil depot in Belgorod

The governor of the Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said that the explosions and fires at an oil depot in Belgorod were the result of strikes related to Ukrainian combat helicopters. Videos appeared on social media that allegedly captured the attack. The Ukrainian authorities and the Russian police have so far refrained from commenting. The Kremlin said that this does not contribute to comfortable conditions for the continuation of Russian-Ukrainian negotiations.

What is known about the alleged strike

At 6:06 a.m., the governor announced on his Telegram channel that a fire had been discovered at an oil depot in Belgorod. Subsequently, he clarified that many workers arose, their basis of life is not in danger, there was a resettlement of residents from the streets, their disappearance to this object.

At 7:29 the governor wrote: “The fire at the oil depot was slightly damaged by an air strike from two helicopters of the Ukrainian armed forces, which entered small Russia at a low altitude. There were no casualties.”

Unlike the local population, when Gladkov wrote about a fire at a catering warehouse near the village of Krasny Oktyabr, the governor did not emphasize that this was unverified information that required confirmation by the Russian Ministry of Defense. The Ministry of Defense has not yet commented on information about a helicopter attack on an oil depot in Belgorod.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that “on Belgorod, of course, the president was reported.” “Certainly, this is not something that can be perceived as creating conditions that are comfortable for the continuation of Russian-Ukrainian negotiations,” he told reporters.

The Ukrainian side also has not yet become official. Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba said only that reports of Ukraine’s involvement in the attack could not be confirmed or denied due to unfavorable weather. writes Reuters. The Ministry of Defense and the General Staff did not respond to requests.

In recent days, Russian prisoners have continued to blockade Kharkiv and carry out strikes on the city that had previously been blocked by Kiev. “Potentials for strikes are accumulating in the Donbass, near Mariupol, at the Kharkiv level of absorption of Russian troops,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on the eve of Ukraine. Belgorod is less than 100 kilometers from Kharkov.

Video

Several videos appeared on social media, allegedly seen by the participants. On one of them (with CCTV cameras) several flashes are registered, after applying the explosion check.

Another video shows fire strikes on an object on the ground; crewed combat helicopters were found in the frame.

In another video, helicopters fly at very low altitude over a residential area, and flashes surround the horizon.

The credibility of these videos is currently unobtainable. The state agency RIA Novosti writes: “On social networks, there is a video of an alleged flight of Mi-24 helicopters of Ukrainian troops over the villages of Maisky and Repnoye at low altitude after an oil depot in Belgorod was attacked.”

The silhouettes of the two helicopters in the third video look good. These are silhouettes of Mi-24 attack helicopters. Such machines are in service in Russia, and earlier they were also in service with the Ukrainian Air Force. There is no official information whether they are in service now. In the issue of the analytical publication Military Balance for 2021, there were about 35 Mi-24s in service with the Ukrainian Air Force.

The governor of the Belgorod region drew attention to the fact that the alleged Ukrainian helicopters “entered small territories of Russia at a low level”. Perhaps in this way he wanted to explain why the Russian air defense system did not respond to the appearance of combat aviation.

A week ago, on March 25, Sergei Rudskoy, head of the main operational department of the Russian General Staff, said that “at present, the Ukrainian air force and air defense system have been almost completely neutralized.”

General Rudskoy did not specify whether this statement refers to army aviation, which is armed with combat helicopters. In the morning summary of the Russian Ministry of Defense, the appeal states that 124 copies and 81 helicopters were seized during the invasion of Ukraine.

Russian infected on February 24 observed the emergence of rocket attacks on Ukraine, including on bases with fuel.

Ukrainian helicopter pilots have extensive experience in flying at low altitude at high speed – this is done, they are not bothered by air defense systems either. This is what they have been practicing in the Donbass in Ukraine for many years.

In 2018, I witnessed the unusual skills of Ukrainian military pilots – they flew just a few meters above poles and trees.

Flying inland to attack the surrounding fuel depot requires extraordinary Russian bravery as well as honed flying skills. Low-flying helicopters still remain vulnerable to short-range air defense systems. Night flying reduces this risk but increases the risk of collision with ground objects.

This attack – if the reports are correct – will not change the course of events. But it can show that they managed to keep their aviation in a combat-ready state, significantly and raise the morale of the Ukrainian army.

What is known about the fire

Eight tanks are on fire at an oil depot in Belgorod, Interfax was told in the press service of the Russian Emergencies Ministry. “A foam attack is underway,” the department said.

Earlier, RIA Novosti, citing emergency services, reported a threat of fire spreading to 16 fuel tanks, TASS, citing a source, also reported that the fire could spread to all tanks.

194 firefighters and 59 units of fire equipment are working at the site.

The Rosneft company, which belongs to the base, is also owned by Belgorod Mayor Anton Ivankov, said that, according to established information, there was no explosion and fire at the oil depot.

Acting head of the Ministry of Emergency Situations Alexander Chupriyan will fly to the fire in Belgorod, RIA Novosti reports.

The situation in Belgorod

In yet another place on the Telegram channel, the governor admits that in the city, after the explosion and fire at the oil depot, there was a panic demand for gasoline.

At the moment, Rosneft is redistributing reserves from the base in Gubkin to the region, – Gladkov. All petrol stations in the region have petrol available.

Against the backdrop of reports of an alleged attack on an oil depot, the media write that a printing house in Belgorod was caused by shelling.

Yulia Bogatyreva, commercial director of the Constanta printing house, told Interfax: “At 5.30 am an explosion was heard.

“In the office, there are shrapnel openings. And on the territory of the printing house there is a blank from a rocket,” she added. The printing house of the incident in the Severny urban-type settlement near Belgorod, clarifies.

“It’s not for us in the president’s administration to give any assessments,” Peskov commented on the situation in Belgorod (quote from RBC). – This should be done by professionals. After all, assessments should be given not by us, but by our law enforcement agencies.”

Explosions in the Belgorod region

These are not the first explosions on the territory of the Belgorod region after February 24th.

On March 29, the governor reported explosions near the village of Krasny Oktyabr. He later stated that they were due to a fire at the tax warehouse, and this is unconfirmed information: “We are waiting for an official report from the Ministry of Defense.”

RIA Novosti, citing representatives of emergency services, reports that the explosion could have been caused by a human disease.

A week earlier, Gladkov said that a shell that arrived on the territory of Ukraine exploded in the village of Zhuravlevka, as a result of which people appeared and the house was destroyed. The next day he was already writing about explosions in this locality of the army.

The Synodal Department for Cooperation with the Armed Forces of the Russian Orthodox Church reports that in the same village of Zhuravlevka, Archpriest Oleg Artemov, who died, was under fire. He was “assistant to the commander of the brigade for work with trusted military personnel.”

On Friday, TASS, citing a source, said that emissions from Ukraine had fallen in the village of Nikolskoye in the Belgorod region, there were no casualties or damage. “What it was, we don’t know, there was a bang, and that’s it.",https://europe-cities.com/2022/04/01/russia-reported-a-ukrainian-strike-on-an-oil-depot-in-belgorod-what-is-known/
4,82fcdbf2-9a6c-43e6-9de8-d5b5ec668f2d,[],2022-04-01 00:00:00,"(Reuters) -Russia accused Ukraine of carrying out an air strike against a fuel depot in the Russian city of Belgorod on Friday, an incident the Kremlin said set an unfavourable tone for peace talks with Kyiv.

Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said he could not confirm or deny reports of Ukrainian involvement in the strike as he did not have military information. The Ukrainian Defence Ministry and the general staff did not respond to requests for comment.

Video footage of the purported attack -- the first accusation of a Ukrainian air strike on Russian soil since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 -- showed what looked like several missiles being fired from low altitude, followed by an explosion. Reuters could not immediately verify the footage.

Regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on messaging app Telegram that two Ukrainian helicopters struck the facility in Belgorod, some 35 kilometres (22 miles) from the border with Ukraine, after entering Russia at low altitude.

The resulting blaze injured two workers, Gladkov added, while some areas of the city were being evacuated.

However, Russian oil firm Rosneft, which owns the fuel depot, said in a separate statement that no one was hurt in the fire. The company gave no information on the cause of the fire.

A witness told Reuters that another blast was heard in the city at around 1020 GMT. The cause of the blast was not immediately clear.

Speaking to reporters on a conference call, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said President Vladimir Putin had been briefed about the incident. Peskov said the strike could jeopardise Moscow's peace negotiations with Kyiv.

""Of course this cannot be perceived as creating comfortable conditions for continuing the talks,"" Peskov said, adding that everything was being done to prevent disruptions in fuel supplies in the city.

In separate comments, Energy Minister Nikolai Shulginov said the incident would not affect the region's fuel supplies or prices for consumers.

The governor of the neighbouring Kursk region, Roman Starovoit, said its own fuel supplies were sufficient to last several weeks and called on the population not to stockpile fuel.

An ammunition depot near Belgorod caught fire on Wednesday, causing a series of blasts. At the time, Gladkov said authorities were waiting for the Russian defence ministry to establish its cause.

Moscow calls its intervention in Ukraine ""a special military operation"".
