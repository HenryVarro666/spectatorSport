ANKARA

Russian and Ukrainian delegations will hold the second round of face-to-face negotiations in Turkey’s Istanbul in a bid to reach a ceasefire.

Peace talks between Ukraine and Russia will be hosted by Turkey, the Turkish Presidential Communications Directorate announced on March 27 following a phone conversation between President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin.

The Turkish president told his Russian counterpart that a ceasefire and better humanitarian conditions were needed.

“Erdoğan noted the importance of a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, the implementation of peace and the improvement of humanitarian conditions in the region,” the statement said.

Erdoğan told Putin that Turkey would continue to contribute in every possible way during this process, according to the statement.

Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu held phone talks with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, on March 27 and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on March 28 and discussed the situation in Ukraine and the planned negotiations.

Çavuşoğlu, meanwhile, said Turkey acknowledges its responsibility for efforts to resolve the Russia-Ukrainian conflict.

“Upon the initiative of Erdoğan, the negotiation delegations of Russia and Ukraine will meet in Turkey. We are aware of the responsibility stemming from the trust vested in Turkey by both sides. We hope the meetings will result in a lasting ceasefire and enable peace,” Çavuşoğlu tweeted.

Davyd Arakhamia, a Ukrainian delegate in talks with Russia on ending the war, said in a Facebook post the countries would meet in Turkey beginning March 28. However, the Russians then announced the talks would start on March 29. The sides have met previously with no deal reached.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hailed the resumption of over-the-table talks, saying they must bring peace “without delay” and signaling a willingness to compromise on the most sensitive topics.

The fate of Russian-occupied Donbas and Crimea, as well as fundamental disagreements about Kiev’s alignment with the West, are again set to be the focus of negotiations. “Our goal is obvious -- peace and the restoration of normal life in our native state as soon as possible,” Zelensky said in a late-night video message that also set out his negotiating red lines.

“Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are beyond doubt. Effective security guarantees for our state are mandatory,” he said. Zelensky had previously indicated he is “carefully” considering a Russian demand of Ukrainian “neutrality” and indicated that he was willing to negotiate the future of Donbas at a later date. “We understand that it is impossible to liberate all territory by force, that would mean World War III, I fully understand and realize that,” he said.

For his part, Putin has avoided clearly defining the goals of his invasion, stating only that he wants to “demilitarise and denazify” but not occupy Ukraine.

The Kremlin said that the talks between Russia and Ukraine may get under way in Turkey on March 29. “While we cannot and will not speak about progress at the talks, the fact that they continuing to take place in person is important, of course,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters.

“We are adhering to a policy of not disclosing any information about the talks, which we think could only hurt the negotiation process,” he said.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said a meeting between Putin and Zelensky would be counterproductive if it were held now. “A meeting between Putin and Zelenskiy is needed as soon as we will be close to resolving all key issues,” Lavrov said in an interview with Serbian media.

Turkey is among the countries that could offer Ukraine security guarantees as part of any deal with Russia to end the war in Ukraine, Ihor Zhovkva, deputy head of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s office, said ahead of peace talks scheduled between Kiev and Moscow in Turkey.",https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/istanbul-to-host-ukraine-russia-talks-172549

06:14 am: Trump asks Putin to help dish dirt on Hunter Biden

Donald Trump has called on Russian President Vladimir Putin, who launched an invasion of Ukraine last month, to reveal any compromising information he might have on US President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter.

The former Republican president returned to accusations he had repeated many times during his unsuccessful campaign against Biden in the 2020 presidential election.

In an interview excerpt broadcast Tuesday by Real America’s Voice “Just the News” show, Trump claimed that the wife of the mayor of Moscow gave $3.5 million to Hunter Biden.

“That’s a lot of money,” he said. “She gave him $3.5 million so now I would think Putin would know the answer to that. I think he should release it.”

Trump has long claimed, without providing evidence, that the younger Biden received the funds from Elena Baturina, wife of the late Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov, in a bid to curry favor with Joe Biden.

04:55 am: US State Department warns that Moscow may ‘detain’ Americans in Russia

The US State Department issued a travel advisory on Tuesday warning that Moscow “may single out and detain US citizens in Russia” and repeating earlier warnings for Americans not to travel to the country.

The warning was “due to the unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine by Russian military forces” as well as the potential for harassment of US citizens by Russian authorities, the travel advisory said, repeating calls for Americans travelling or living in Russia to leave “immediately”.

03:57 am: Death toll in Mykolaiv strike rises to 12

At least 12 people were killed and 33 wounded on Tuesday when a Russian missile hit a regional government building in the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv, emergency officials said.

“The bodies of 12 people have been recovered from the site of the destruction and 33 people have been injured,” Ukraine’s emergencies agency said in a statement on Telegram.

Photos posted by the agency showed rescue workers clearing the rubble and a female medical worker in a red suit helping an injured man lying on a stretcher, his face bloodied.

Earlier in the day officials spoke of nine people being killed and 28 injured in the strike, which hit the nine-storey building shortly before 9 am local time, destroying the entire central part of the structure.

After a lull in the fighting that lasted several days, the attack on Tuesday morning surprised this city, which is home to half a million people in peacetime. Mykolaiv stands on the road to Odesa, Ukraine’s largest port in the south.

The front line in the region has recently shifted southeast to Mykolaiv, which is located near Kherson, the only major Ukrainian city that Russia claims to have taken under full control since the war started over a month ago.

03:06 am: With Ukraine farmers on frontlines, UN food chief warns of ‘devastation’

The UN food chief warned on Tuesday that the war in Ukraine was threatening to devastate the World Food Programme’s efforts to feed some 125 million people globally because Ukraine had gone “from the breadbasket of the world to breadlines.”

“It’s not just decimating dynamically Ukraine and the region, but it will have global context impact beyond anything we’ve seen since World War Two,” WFP Executive Director David Beasley told the 15-member United Nations Security Council.

Beasley said 50 percent of the grain bought by the WFP, the food-assistance branch of the United Nations, comes from Ukraine, “so you can only assume the devastation that this is going to have on our operations alone.”

“The farmers are on the frontlines,” he said.

Beasley added that the crisis was compounded by a lack of fertilizer products coming from Belarus and Russia.

“If you don’t put fertilizer on the crops, your yield will be at least 50% diminished. So we’re looking at what could be a catastrophe on top of a catastrophe in the months ahead,” he told the council.

01:14 am: Thousands of civilians may have died in Mariupol in past month, UN says

Thousands of civilians may have died in the besieged port city of Mariupol in southern Ukraine since bombing began four weeks ago, the head of the UN human rights mission told Reuters on Tuesday, providing its first estimate.

Nearly 5,000 people, including about 210 children, have been killed in Mariupol since Russian forces laid siege to it a month ago, a spokesperson for Mayor Vadym Boichenko said on Monday.

His office said 90% of Mariupol’s buildings had been damaged and 40% destroyed, including hospitals, schools, kindergartens and factories.

“We do think that there could be thousands of deaths, of civilian casualties, in Mariupol,” Matilda Bogner, head of the UN human rights mission in Ukraine which deploys some 60 monitors, said in a virtual interview.

She said the mission did not have a precise estimate but was working to gather more information.

Local officials, citing witness accounts, last week estimated that 300 people were killed in the March 16 bombing of a Mariupol theatre where people were sheltering.

As of Tuesday, the UN human rights office had confirmed 1,179 civilians killed and 1,860 injured across Ukraine in the five-week old conflict, amid reporting delays due to the hostilities, a statement said.

March 30, 00:36 am: Western diplomats accuse Russia of fuelling global food crisis

Western diplomats accused Russia before the UN Security Council on Tuesday of having caused a “global food crisis” and putting people at risk of “famine” by starting the war in Ukraine, which serves as a breadbasket for Europe.

Russian President Vladimir Putin “started this war. Vladimir Putin created this global food crisis. And he is the one who can stop it,” US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said during a Security Council meeting devoted to the humanitarian situation in Ukraine.

France’s ambassador to the UN, Nicolas de Riviere, furthered that “Russia’s aggression against Ukraine is increasing the risk of famine around the world” and that populations in developing countries would be the first to be affected.

“Russia will no doubt try to make us believe that it is the sanctions adopted against it that are creating an imbalance in the world security situation for food,” de Riviere added.

Moscow’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia indeed countered that potential turbulence in the global food market was in fact caused by “the unbridled sanctions hysteria that the West has unleashed against Russia.”

Sherman and the director of the World Food Program (WFP), David Beasley, reported that Ukraine and Russia, which are both major cereal producers, represent 30 percent of world wheat exports, 20 percent for corn and 75 percent for sunflower oil.

10:06 pm: Ukraine's Zelensky calls Russia talks 'positive' but wants to see results

Russia poses a significant threat to Kyiv through its forces’ strike capability even though Ukrainian forces continue localised counterattacks to the northwest of the city, British military intelligence said on Tuesday.

Russian forces have maintained their offensive on Mariupol with continuous heavy shelling of the city, the UK’s ministry of defence said in a statement. ""However the centre of the city remains under Ukrainian control.""

Elsewhere, Russian forces are maintaining blocking positions while attempting to reorganise and reset their forces, it added.

7:21 am: Ukrainian and Russian delegations prepare for talks in Istanbul

Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said peace talks in Istanbul would focus on easing the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, with securing a ceasefire the top objective.

""The minimum programme will be humanitarian questions, and the maximum programme is reaching an agreement on a ceasefire,"" Kuleba said Tuesday.

Ahead of the talks, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country is prepared to declare its neutrality, as Moscow has demanded, and is open to compromise on the fate of the Donbas, the contested region in the country’s east.

6,784a81f7-e893-4deb-ba6a-7b930911f517,[],2022-03-28 00:00:00,"March 28 (Reuters) - The Kremlin said that peace talks between Russia and Ukraine may get under way in Turkey on Tuesday and it was important that they would take place face-to-face, after what it described as a lack of major progress in negotiations so far.

Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan agreed in a telephone call on Sunday for Istanbul to host the talks, which Ankara hopes will lead to a ceasefire in Ukraine.

Turkey said the talks could begin as early as Monday, but Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that was unlikely as the negotiators would only be arriving in Turkey on Monday.

""While we cannot and will not speak about progress at the talks, the fact that they continuing to take place in person is important, of course,"" Peskov told reporters on a conference call.

""We are adhering to a policy of not disclosing any information about the talks, which we think could only hurt the negotiation process.""

Peskov added that no major progress had been made in the talks themselves, or on the idea of a potential meeting between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

""Unfortunately we cannot see any substantial achievements or breakthroughs (in the talks) so far,"" he said.

In separate comments, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said a meeting between the two leaders would be counterproductive if it were held now. He said they should meet once the sides achieve progress.

""A meeting between Putin and Zelenskiy is needed as soon as we will be close to resolving all key issues,"" Lavrov said in an interview with Serbian media.

Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour's military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists.

Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw its forces.

7,784a81f7-e893-4deb-ba6a-7b930911f517,"['Jon Henley', 'Pjotr Sauer', 'Shaun Walker']",2022-03-29 00:00:00,"Volodymyr Zelenskiy has dismissed Russia’s pledge to drastically cut back its military activity in northern Ukraine, saying “Ukrainians are not naive people” and vowing to continue defensive military efforts.

Zelenskiy said in a video address early on Wednesday: “Ukrainians have already learned during these 34 days of invasion and over the past eight years of the war in Donbas that only a concrete result can be trusted.”

Russia’s deputy defence minister Alexander Fomin said after talks in Istanbul on Tuesday that Moscow wanted to “increase mutual trust, create the right conditions for future negotiations and reach the final aim of signing a peace deal with Ukraine”, and that the Kremlin would “radically reduce military activity in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv”.

Ukraine’s president said that while there had been “positive” signals from the latest talks, “they do not drown out the explosions of Russian shells”. “The enemy is still in our territory,” he said. “The shelling of our cities continues. Mariupol is blocked. Missile and airstrikes do not stop. This is the reality. These are the facts.”

Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces said in its latest intelligence report on Tuesday night that Russian troops continued to withdraw from the territory of Kyiv and Chernihiv but the movement is merely “a rotation of individual units” and aims to “mislead the military leadership” of Ukraine.

The scepticism echoes that of experts and western diplomats and leaders, who expressed doubts that the move was more than a ploy to dress up setbacks on the ground.

An unconvinced Joe Biden said: “We’ll see. I don’t read anything into it until I see what their actions are.”

While Moscow presented its move as a goodwill gesture, it came as Russia’s advance appeared to have stalled on several fronts, with the Kremlin’s forces thwarted by stiff Ukrainian resistance, heavy losses and logistical and tactical failings.

Having failed to seize the Ukrainian capital and force an early capitulation, Moscow said last week it was shifting its focus to expanding the territory held by pro-Russia separatists in the eastern Donbas region. The defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said hours before the talks the “main goal” was now the “liberation” of Donbas.

The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said he had not seen anything indicating that talks were progressing in a “constructive way” and suggested Russian indications of a pullback could be an attempt by Moscow to “deceive people and deflect attention”.

Speaking on a visit to Morocco, Blinken said that there was “what Russia says, and what Russia does, and we’re focused on the latter. What Russia is doing is the continued brutalisation of Ukraine.”

A spokesperson for Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, said the UK had seen signs of “some reduction” in Russian bombardment around Kyiv, but added: “We will judge Putin and his regime by his actions, not by his words … We don’t want to see anything less than a complete withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukrainian territory.”

The UK’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) said in its latest updated that “it is almost certain that the Russian offensive has failed in its objective to encircle Kyiv”. The UK defence attaché Mick Smeath in a statement: “Russian statements regarding a reduction in activity around Kyiv, and reporting indicating the withdrawal of some Russian units from these areas, may indicate Russia’s acceptance that it has now lost the initiative in the region.” He added: “It is highly likely that Russia will seek to divert combat power from the north to their offensive in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the east.”

Western officials were “very wary” about the promises, saying the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, could be temporising. “Certainly in terms of the negotiations, nothing that we have seen so far has demonstrated to us that Putin and his colleagues are particularly serious,” one said. “It’s more of a tactical exercise in playing for time.”

John Kirby, press secretary at the Pentagon, warned against “fooling ourselves” over the Kremlin’s claims. “Has there been some movement by some Russian units away from Kyiv in the last day or so? Yeah, we think so, small numbers,” he said. “But we believe that this is a repositioning, not a real withdrawal, and that we all should be prepared to watch for a major offensive against other areas of Ukraine.”

Ukraine presented Russian negotiators in Istanbul with a framework for peace under which it would remain neutral with its security guaranteed by third-party countries including the US, the UK, France, Turkey, China and Poland, in an arrangement similar to Nato’s article 5, which commits members to defend one another.

It also said it would be willing to agree to a 15-year consultation period on the status of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, with both countries agreeing not to use their militaries to resolve the issue in the meantime, and called for Russia to drop its objection to Ukrainian membership of the EU.

The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, said “both sides are getting closer at every stage”, adding that the Istanbul talks could lead in the first instance to a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers.

However, analysts warned that the demands were unlikely to be readily accepted by the Kremlin. “I would be very careful about getting too optimistic. We have only heard the Ukrainian proposals. We need to wait for Russia’s responses,” said Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Centre.

Gabuev said Kyiv’s proposals “would look like a loss to Putin, who in his mind already settled the Crimean question a long time ago”. Russia’s military pullback “could just be a temporary strategic move”, he added.

The senior Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak described Kyiv’s proposal on guaranteed neutrality as “an effective tool for protecting our territory and sovereignty”, with “the leading armies of the world becoming guarantors and assuming specific legal obligations” to intervene in the event of aggression.

The proposal on Crimea was also “revolutionary”, Podolyak said, not only because it meant “the return of the topic of Crimea to the negotiating agenda” but because it would “allow us to preserve the current legal interpretations of Crimea, since Crimea is, of course, a part of Ukraine for us”.

Even as the peace negotiators began their work, however, Zelenskiy, said in a speech to the Danish parliament that at least seven people had been killed and 22 injured in a Russian strike on a regional government building in the southern port of Mykolaiv. “People are still going through the rubble,” he said.

Zelenskiy also called the Russian bombardment and siege of the port city of Mariupol, where local officials have said at least 5,000 people have died, a “crime against humanity … happening in front of the eyes of the whole planet, in real time”.

Russia’s foreign ministry said in a Telegram post on Tuesday night that Putin had told Emmanuel Macron in a phone call that “Ukrainian nationalist militants” in Mariupol must lay down their weapons in order to resolve the humanitarian crisis there.

Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, which began on 24 February, has killed an estimated 20,000 people, forced more than 10 million from their homes – including more than 3.8 million who have fled the country – and triggered an unprecedented range of western economic sanctions against Russia.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/29/ukraine-russia-peace-talks-istanbul-war-kyiv

Russian media reports say President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan yesterday had a phone conversation.

During the conversation, they reportedly discussed the latest situation in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the negotiation process.

Recep Tayyip Erdogan told Vladimir Putin, that Turkey will continue its mediatory efforts to establish peace between Russia and Ukraine, the Turkish presidential office said in a statement.

He, in particular, noted that a ceasefire and peace between Russia and Ukraine must be achieved as soon as possible and the humanitarian situation in the region should be improved.

The two leaders ""agreed that the next meeting of the negotiation teams of Russia and Ukraine will be held in Istanbul,"" the statement said.

Meanwhile, Russian presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, who leads the Russian delegation to the talks, wrote on his Telegram channel earlier on Sunday that a regular round on online talks with Ukraine was held on Sunday. According to TASS, the sides, in his words, agreed to meet offline on March 29-30.

To-date, Russian and Ukrainian delegations have held three rounds of peace talks in-person in Belarus since February 28, and the fourth one started on March 14 in a format of video conference.

Previously, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, met in a resort town of Turkey's southern province of Antalya on March 10.

The meeting, held on the sidelines of the Antalya Diplomatic Forum, was the first high-level talks between Moscow and Kiev since Russia launched the so-called special military operation in Ukraine on February 24.

During the meeting, the two sides failed to make progress on a ceasefire but agreed to continue negotiations over the conflict.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskiy on March 27 gave a roughly 90-minute interview to Meduza and the Russian TV station Dozhd, daily Kommersant, and YouTube channel Zygar.

In giving the interview, Zelenskiy said he wanted “Russia to know the truth” about the war.

In a statement issued later in the day, Roskomnadzor warned agencies against publishing the interview, saying an “inspection has been launched” against the four media outlets.

The Prosecutor-General Office of Russia said it would give a “legal assessment” of the material if published.

Russia has criminalized the use of the word “war” to describe its actions in Ukraine, describing it instead as a “special military operation.”

It has also passed a law criminalizing the publication of “fake” information about its war in Ukraine, with those “guilty” facing up to 15 years in prison.

Roskomnadzor has also recently banned multiple news websites, including Meduza and Dozhd, as well as popular social media networks such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.",https://asiaplustj.info/en/news/world/20220328/putin-and-erdogan-agree-to-hold-next-round-of-russia-ukraine-negotiations-in-turkey
