According to Haidai: ""56 people were killed in Kreminna. On 11 March, Russian occupiers fired from a tank onto a care home for the elderly in Kreminna. They did it deliberately and cynically. They just positioned their tank in front of the building and began firing.""

Details: Haidai also said that the 56 people who were spending the last years of their lives in the care home died on the spot.

The 15 people who survived were abducted by the Russian soldiers and taken to the regional geriatric care facility in Svatove, in the temporarily occupied territory of the Luhansk region.

The shocking incident is said to have taken place in the small city of Kreminna in the breakaway pro-Russian region of Luhansk.

Some 15 survivors were then reportedly abducted by Russian troops and taken to the nearby city of Svatove, some 25 miles north, in territory occupied by forces loyal to Vladimir Putin.

The attack allegedly took place on March 11 but is only being reported on now as Ukrainian authorities have been unable to reach the nursing home.

If true, it would certainly be classed as a war crime by Russian forces.

Ukraine's claims have not been independently verified but were tweeted out by Ukraine's State Service of Special Communications.

In a statement, it said: ""56 people were killed in Kreminna, Luhansk Oblast - the occupiers shot from a tank (a) home for the elderly.

""Russians fired at it. Cynically and deliberately. They adjusted the tank, put it in front of the house, and started firing.""

The statement went on: ""Those who lived to their old age in the house - 56 people - died on the spot. The survivors, 15 people, were abducted by the occupiers and taken to the occupied territory in Svatove to the regional geriatric boarding school.""

In a separate statement on the messaging app Telegram, Serhiy Haidai, governor of the Luhansk Regional State Administration, said: ""It is still impossible to get to the site of the tragedy.""

The statement was also shared by Olexander Scherba, Ukraine's former ambassador to Austria.

""Absolute horror in Kreminna near Luhansk,"" he tweeted. ""On March 11, (a) Russian tank approached the local senior home and fired multiple shots. 56 civilians dead - Luhansk governor.""

Russia has continually denied Western claims its forces are deliberately targetting civilians.

It comes as...

Kreminna's mayor, Vlodymyr Struk, was reportedly shot dead after being kidnapped from his home a couple of weeks ago.

The pro-Russian Struk had welcomed Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

His wife claimed he suffered a ""gunshot wound to the heart"" after he was ""abducted from his home"".

Announcing the death of Facebook, Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's Interior Minister, claimed he was a ""Luhansk People's Republic supporter"" who actively pursued a ""pro-Russian position"" by ""communicating with the Russian Federation"".

Gerashchenko branded Struk a ""traitor"" and alleged he ""was judged by the court of the people's tribunal"".

Twitter user 'Ukraine War News' added that Struk had ""actively called on local deputies to cooperate with Russians"".

Ukraine's government has issued a crackdown on groups or individuals considered ""pro-Russian"" in recent weeks.

This weekend, it was announced that 11 political parties considered to be supportive of the Kremlin had been banned.

It comes as Russian forces allegedly bombed a school in Mariupol where up to 400 civilians were sheltering from shelling.

A number of women and children are still said to be trapped under the rubble following the attack overnight.

It currently remains unknown if there are any casualties.

The strategically-crucial southern port city has witnessed some of the heaviest fighting of the war so far.

This week, Putin's troops bombed a theatre in Mariupol being used as a shelter by around 1,200 people.

Around 130 people were rescued but true casualty numbers are not yet known.

Satellite images showed the word ""children"" written in large white letters in Russian outside the front and back of the building, the Maxar space technology company said.

In a statement, Ukraine's foreign ministry said: ""The theatre building served as a shelter for hundreds of Mariupol residents who had lost their homes as a result of Russian armed forces bombing and shelling the city.

""The bomb strike demolished the central part of the theatre building, causing large numbers of people to be buried under the debris.

""An assessment of the exact number of persons affected is currently impossible due to ongoing shelling.

""By delivering a purposeful bomb attack to the place of mass gathering of civilians Russia has committed another war crime.

""Putin’s regime has long since crossed the line of humanity.""

Pictures showed a pile of rubble with twisted metal and smoke rising from the ruins while videos showed blood-soaked victims being rushed to hospital – and numerous bodies in the basement of the theatre.

The Mayor of Mariupol, Vadym Boychenko, said that efforts to rescue hundreds of people trapped in the basement of a bombed theatre in the city have been hampered.

About 300,000 people are trapped in the city, as food, water, and medical supplies run out and Russia blocks the entry of humanitarian aid.

""[There is] street fighting in the city centre,"" Mr Boychenko said, confirming a claim made by Russia on Friday when it said it was ""tightening the noose"" around the city.

""There are tanks... and artillery shelling, and all kinds of weapons fired in the area,"" the mayor said.

""Our forces are doing everything they can to hold their positions in the city but the forces of the enemy are larger than ours, unfortunately.""

City authorities also claimed that some residents of Mariupol were being forcibly taken to Russia and stripped of their Ukrainian passports.

""The occupiers are sending the residents of Mariupol to filtration camps, checking their phones and seizing (their) Ukrainian documents,"" Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the Donetsk regional administration said, adding that more than 1,000 Mariupol residents had been deported.

""I appeal to the international community: put pressure on Russia and its madman of a leader,"" he said on Facebook.

Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky has today warned that if negotiations with President Putin fail it could result in another world war.

Ms Denisova added: “It is still impossible to get to the site of the tragedy to bury the dead old people. This is another act of horrific genocide – the extermination of the civilian population of Ukraine.”

Ms Denisova has reiterated calls for Russia to be held accountable for its acts and urged the International Criminal Court, which has launched a war crimes investigation into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to take this latest report into account.

She said: “For every such crime, for every innocent life taken, the leadership of the aggressor state must be held accountable in all the severity of international criminal law.”

Reports of the attack on the nursing home come after Ukrainian authorities said an art school in Mariupol, where around 400 people had taken refuge from artillery fire, was bombed.

Officials in Ukraine said the building has been destroyed and victims remain under the rubble.

(Vassil Donev/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)

US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said on Sunday that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s campaign in Ukraine is “stalled,” which is why he has resorted to “disgusting” attacks against civilians there.

“We've seen deliberate targeting of cities and towns and civilians throughout the last several weeks,” Austin told CBS's ""Face the Nation.""

“And again, I believe that he's taking these kinds of steps because as was described earlier, his campaign has stalled. He's not been able to achieve the goals as rapidly that he wants to achieve as rapidly as he wants to achieve them. And so he's, he's resorting to the types of tactics that we see on display every day. And again, this is really disgusting.”

Austin added later that “the maneuver forces on the ground are essentially stalled and it's been, it's had the effect of him moving his forces into a wood chipper.”

Even so, Austin said there does not yet appear to be evidence that mercenaries or foreign fighters have shown up in Ukraine to help Russia. “We have not seen mercenaries show up on the battlefield, to my knowledge,” he said.

Asked about Russia’s claim that it has launched hypersonic missiles against Ukraine, Austin said he does not believe Russia’s use of such missiles would be a “game changer,” though he cautioned that he “cannot confirm or dispute” that they have been deployed.

“I would not see it as a game changer,” he said. “I think, again, the reason that he's resorting to using these types of weapons is because he's trying to reestablish some momentum … you kind of question why he would do this. Is he running low on precision guided munitions?”

US officials confirmed to CNN on Saturday that Russia had used hypersonic missiles in its war against Ukraine.

Austin also said that if Putin used chemical or biological weapons against Ukraine, “he would see a significant reaction from not only the United States but also the global community.”

“And again, I don't want to speculate about what exactly would change our calculation. I think, I think, you know, engaging in hypotheticals is probably not helpful here, either. But I think this is a very serious step.

Here are five key developments from today, and you can follow the latest news in our daily liveblog.

1. Russia accused of killing 56 elderly people and 'abducting' others

Ukraine has accused Russia's military of killing 56 elderly people in the eastern Luhansk region by deliberately firing at a care home.

Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman, Lyudmyla Denisova, described the attack as “another terrible crime against humanity”.

In a post on Telegram, Ms Denisova said: “In the town of Kreminna on March 11, the Russian occupiers cynically and purposefully fired from a tank at a home for the elderly. 56 residents who lived to their old age in the house died on the spot.

Ms Denisova added that it was “still impossible to get to the site of the tragedy” to bury those who had died.

2. Mariupol civilians ‘forcibly’ taken to Russia

Civilians in Mariupol have been forcibly taken to Russia by enemy forces, the city’s authorities have said.

""People who are being forcibly taken to Russia are being stripped of their Ukrainian passports and given a piece of paper that carries no legal weight and is not recognised by the entire civilised world,"" the city council said.

Pavlo Kyrylenko, the head of the Donetsk regional administration, said that more than 1,000 residents had been deported to “filtration camps”.

""The occupiers are sending the residents of Mariupol to filtration camps, checking their phones and seizing (their) Ukrainian documents,” he said.
