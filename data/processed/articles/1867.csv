Partial withdrawal of Russian troop units from the Polesie and Siverski areas has been observed. At the same time, the invading forces are preparing to move additional units (reserves) of the Eastern Military District to conduct combat operations in Ukraine.

On the Volyn front, units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus are taking measures to strengthen the protection of the Belarusian-Ukrainian border.

The invader has not carried out any offensive actions on the Polesie front. The main efforts of the invaders are focused on defending the previously occupied lines, and regrouping and withdrawing troops to Belarusian territory to restore combat effectiveness. In order to ensure the withdrawal of its units, the aggressor is laying mines on the terrain and within infrastructure, and is using artillery.

Units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine have restored control over the settlements of Demydiv, Dymer, Lytvynivka, Havrylivka, Kozarovychi, Zhovtneve, Hlybivka, Yasnohorodka, Tolokun, Sukholuchchya, Lypivka, Havronshchyna, Makovyshche, Mykolaivka, and Khmilna.

On the Siverski front, the invading forces continue to blockade the city of Chernihiv. At the same time, the movement of troops of the Central Military District to areas close to the state border of Ukraine has been observed.

During the course of the day, the invaders engaged in combat operations towards the settlement of Mala Komyshuvakha, but were blocked, achieving no advance.
