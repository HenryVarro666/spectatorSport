The United States announced a deal with European leaders on Friday to increase shipments of natural gas to help wean Europe off Russian energy. And Germany set an ambitious goal of halving its imports of Russian oil and coal this year and freeing itself from its dependence on Russian natural gas by the middle of 2024.

Germany’s timelines, outlined by its vice chancellor, are a remarkable turnabout by Europe’s largest economy, which has long relied extensively on Russia for energy. Just a few months ago, Germany was still aiming to buy even more natural gas from Moscow through a new pipeline called Nord Stream 2.

But President Vladimir V. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has forced leaders in Germany and other European countries to rip up the energy playbook they had used for years, decades even, in just a month. The German vice chancellor, Robert Habeck, said at a briefing in Berlin that his country was shifting away from Russian energy at an “insane pace.”

President Biden is seeking to encourage similar moves by other European countries, in part by offering up the United States as an energy supplier.

The deal he announced, in Brussels earlier on Friday, lacked many details but contained some big goals: The United States would send an additional 15 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas to Europe this year — roughly 10 to 12 percent of current annual U.S. exports to all countries. By 2030, the president said, the United States will aim to increase supplies by as much as 50 billion cubic meters a year.

The moves caught many in the U.S. energy industry by surprise. Oil and gas executives who have become accustomed to being pilloried for their contributions to climate change were suddenly being called up to help liberate European allies from Russian energy. While the industry was not certain how Europe would make such a giant pivot, executives clearly relished their new casting as saviors rather than villains.

“I have no idea how they are going to do this, but I don’t want to criticize them, because for the first time they are trying to do the right thing,” said Charif Souki, the executive chairman of Tellurian, a U.S. gas producer that is planning to build an export terminal in Louisiana.

Mr. Biden and the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said many of the specifics would be worked out by a task force dedicated to reducing Europe’s dependency on Russian oil and gas in ways that would not undermine the climate policies of the two partners.

Among the things they did not address was the shortage of port capacity to ship and receive more gas on both sides of the Atlantic. The effort could also struggle because the Biden administration can’t simply order U.S. exporters to sell gas to European buyers or to set prices acceptable to those buyers.

“We’re going to have to make sure that families in Europe can get through this winter and the next while we’re building an infrastructure for a diversified, resilient and clean energy future,” Mr. Biden said.

The European Union is heavily reliant on energy imports from Russia, a big producer of oil, diesel, coal and, perhaps most important, natural gas. That dependence has become a growing problem as the European Union seeks to punish Mr. Putin. Russia provides about 40 percent of Europe’s natural gas, and a sizable chunk of it is shipped by pipeline through Ukraine.

Germany has long been one of Russia’s biggest customers. Having decided to shut down its nuclear plants, Germany has increasingly relied on natural gas. Because it got relatively affordable gas by pipeline from Russia — and some from the Netherlands, Norway and other suppliers — it declined to build any terminals where liquefied natural gas could be imported.

Germany also imports nearly a third of its crude oil from Russia. It has been trying to slash its consumption with generous subsidies for electric cars and greater investment in public transportation.

The Ukraine war has accelerated such German efforts under Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who leads a coalition government made up of conservatives, liberals and environmentalists. Germany this year has revived plans to build gas importing terminals and has suspended final approvals of Nord Stream 2, an almost-complete pipeline that would have fed it a steady supply of Russian gas.

“Every supply contract that is terminated hurts Putin,” Mr. Habeck said on Friday.

Later in the day, E.U. countries agreed to jointly purchase and store natural gas. They set a target of filling 80 percent of their underground gas storage facilities by November as a buffer against supply disruptions during winter, when gas use increases for heating.

In the United States, gas exporters were already shifting sales to Europe from Asia in recent months, largely because prices in Europe have been higher than almost anywhere else in the world because of rising tensions with Russia and, more recently, the war in Ukraine. Nearly 75 percent of U.S. L.N.G. exports have gone to Europe so far this year, up from 34 percent in 2021. The Biden administration has encouraged that shift by relaxing export restrictions to certain European countries.

Charlie Riedl, the executive director at the Center for Liquefied Natural Gas, a trade group, said he thought an extra 15 billion cubic feet of U.S. gas exports to Europe could be achieved relatively easily. He said two-thirds of that total could come from diverting shipments that otherwise would be bound for Asia, and the rest could come from recent federal approvals for additional production from existing American L.N.G. export terminals.

“Obviously it’s a positive sign that Europe is making attempts to wean itself off Russian gas,” Mr. Riedl said.

Energy executives say the Biden administration could help increase the flow of gas by streamlining permitting for new U.S. export terminals, where natural gas is chilled into a liquid and pumped into oceangoing tankers. Washington and the European Union could also provide loan guarantees for U.S. export terminals and European import terminals. There are roughly a dozen U.S. export terminals that have won regulatory approval but need financing to be built. About 10 European import terminals are being built.

Executives complain it can take more time to obtain permits for pipelines and export terminals than to build them.

Export terminals require investments of up to $10 billion, while import terminals cost about $1 billion to build. The United States has seven export terminals, and Europe has 28 large-scale import terminals.

Environmentalists criticized Mr. Biden’s announcement because they fear it will commit the United States and Europe to using fossil fuels for decades longer than they argue is sustainable given the growing toll of climate change.

“There is no way to ramp up U.S. L.N.G. exports and deliver on the imperative climate commitments that the U.S. and E.U. have pledged,” said Abigail Dillen, the president of Earthjustice, an environmental law organization. She warned that the buildup of L.N.G. infrastructure would “lock in expensive fossil dependence and dangerous pollution for decades to come.”

American and European officials also agreed to seek ways to decrease greenhouse gas emissions from L.N.G. infrastructure and pipelines and to reduce the release of methane from gas operations. They said they would ramp up energy efficiency initiatives, such as the deployment of heat pumps and the use of clean hydrogen technologies to displace fossil fuels, as well as expedite planning and approval of renewable energy projects such as offshore wind and solar power.

The Biden administration has banned Russian energy imports as part of a set of sanctions against Mr. Putin, a relatively easy step for the United States because it is a net exporter of energy. Some U.S. lawmakers would like the European Union to stop buying oil and gas from Russia altogether, but the prospect for that has been dismissed by several E.U. leaders, who see it as a financially disastrous step that would hurt Europe more than Russia.

Some energy experts said a further escalation of the war, such as a decision by Mr. Putin to use chemical, biological or nuclear weapons, could leave the European Union with little choice but to bar the purchase of Russian energy.

“We want as Europeans to diversify away from Russia, toward suppliers that we trust, that are friends and that are reliable,” Ms. von der Leyen of the European Commission said at the announcement with Mr. Biden. “Therefore the U.S. commitment to provide the European Union with an additional at least 15 billion cubic meters of L.N.G. this year is a big step in this direction, because this will replace the L.N.G. supply we currently receive from Russia.”

Still, oil and gas executives said Mr. Biden and Ms. von der Leyen would have to be patient and recognize that decisions on who sold gas to whom would be made across negotiating tables by private companies, not by politicians. Ultimately, exporters will seek to sell their gas to buyers willing to pay the highest price.

“This is a capitalist system,” Mr. Souki, the Tellurian executive, said. “It’s people like me who make those decisions. The government can’t tell us where to send the gas.”

EU to sanction Russian banks, energy, others

European Union leaders have put on a united front after a six-hour meeting during which they agreed on the second package of economic and financial sanctions on Russia.

The EU Council president accused Russia of using ""fake pretexts and bad excuses"" for justifying its attack on Ukraine and said sanctions will hurt the government.

The legal texts for the sanctions agreed on are expected to be finalised overnight and be submitted for approval to EU foreign affairs ministers Friday.

EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the package includes targeting 70 percent of the Russian banking market and key state-owned companies.

She said Russia's energy sector also will be targeted ""by making it impossible for Russia to upgrade its refineries.""

And there will be a ban on sales of software, semiconductors, and airliners to Russia.

Japan, Australia announce additional sanctions on Russia

Japan and Australia have announced new sanctions targeting Russia over its actions in Ukraine.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said the new measures include freezing the assets of Russian groups, banks and individuals and suspending exports of semiconductors and other sensitive goods to military-linked organisations in Russia.

Kishida said: ""Japan must clearly show its position that we will never tolerate any attempt to change the status quo by force.""

Earlier in the week, Japan suspended new issuances and distribution of Russian government bonds in Japan, aimed to reduce funding for Russia's military. It also banned trade with the two Ukrainian separatist regions.

Meanwhile, Australia imposed more sanctions against Russia targeting several of its elite citizens and lawmakers.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison also accused China of throwing Russia a lifeline by easing trade restrictions at a time much of the world is trying to stop the Russian attacks on Ukraine.

Morrison was reacting to a report in The South China Morning Post that China had announced it was fully open to Russian wheat imports.

Morrison noted that Australia, the United States, Britain, the European Union and Japan are imposing sanctions on Russia, and said China's easing of trade restrictions ""is simply unacceptable.""

In his words: ""You don't go and throw a lifeline to Russia in the middle of a period when they're invading another country.""

Kiev shuts airports, Russia closes huge swath of airspace over eastern Ukraine

The Ukrainian government is closing airports in eastern Ukraine from midnight through 7 am [local time] because of the confrontation with Russia.

Ukrainian aviation authorities also have declared some airspace in the east to be ""danger areas"" because of attempts by Russian aviation authorities to seize control of the airspace.

Ukraine acted after Russia issued a ban on civilian air traffic in the airspace over eastern Ukraine.

Russia closed some airspace in the Rostov flight information region to the east of its border with Ukraine ""in order to provide safety"" for civil aviation flights, according to a notice to airmen.

Meanwhile, a conflict zone monitor said airlines should stop flying over any part of Ukraine because of the risk of an unintended shootdown or a cyberattack targeting air traffic control amid tensions with Russia.

Safe Airspace, which was set up to provide safety and conflict zone information for airlines after Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine in 2014, said it had increased its risk level to ""do not fly"".

""Regardless of the actual movements of Russian forces into Ukraine, the level of tension and uncertainty in Ukraine is now extreme,"" Safe Airspace said on its website.

""This itself gives rise to significant risk to civil aviation.""

Blinken says still time for diplomacy

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he believes Russia will invade Ukraine within hours after separatists asked for Russian help to repel ""aggression"" and as explosions rocked the breakaway eastern city of Donetsk.

""Everything seems to be in place for Russia to engage in a major aggression against Ukraine,"" Blinken said in an interview, adding he could not be precise about time or place.

UNSC members look to act on Ukraine but doomed to fail

United Nations Security Council members are preparing to put forward a draft resolution on Ukraine that will call out Russia over its actions toward its neighbor, said a Security Council diplomat, but the move is doomed to fail.

It will not be adopted by the 15-member council as Russia is a veto power –– along with the United States, France, Britain and China –– but it gives Washington and allies a chance to show that Moscow is internationally isolated over its actions on Ukraine.

""We work on the resolution in the Security Council.

I hope we can move to action in the next hours or days, ... and if we cannot succeed in the Security Council we'll go right away to the General Assembly,"" said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Zelenskyy: Russia approves offensive against Ukraine

Russia has approved an offensive against Ukraine, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said, adding that Russian President Vladimir Putin did not reply to his invitation to hold talks.

""I initiated a telephone call with the president of the Russian federation. Result: silence,"" Zelenskyy said in a late-night address.

On the Ukrainian border ""nearly 200,000 soldiers are stationed, (as are) thousands of combat vehicles,"" Zelenskyy said, adding ""major war in Europe"" could be started by Russia soon.

""I am addressing you Russian citizens as a citizen of Ukraine. We share a more than 2,000 kilometre border, and there are almost more than 200,000 soldiers, thousands of combat vehicles.""

Zelenskyy said: ""We should stop, before it's too late. If the Russian leadership doesn't want to sit down at the negotiating table, they should sit at the table with you. Do Russians want war? I'd love to answer this question but the answer depends only on you.""

Venezuela announces support for Russia



Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has firmly announced his support for Russian President Vladimir Putin, amid what he described as plans by the West to ""surround Russia militarily and strategically"".

Maduro discussed the escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine for more than half an hour during the meeting with his cabinet.

""President Putin denounced before the UN Security Council that they (NATO) intend to surround Russia, pointing all NATO weapons at Russia in order to attack and destroy it when the conditions are right,"" Maduro said.

""And what does the world expect from President Putin, that he should stand idly by and not act in defence of his people? That is why Venezuela announces its full support to President Vladimir Putin.""

Russia’s recognition of Ukraine’s rebel-held Donetsk and Luhansk as “independent” has triggered more sanctions by the West amid fears Moscow will retaliate by cutting off Europe’s gas.

Blinken cancels Geneva meeting with Russia's Lavrov

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has cancelled plans to meet his Russian counterpart in Geneva later this week as Russia presses ahead with recognition of separatist regions of Ukraine and sends troops there.

Russia's actions indicated Moscow was not serious about a diplomatic path to resolving the crisis, Blinken said during a joint press conference with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba at the State Department.

As a result, he said he had called off his Thursday meeting with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

Echoing President Joe Biden, Blinken said Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision to recognise the independence of Ukraine's Donbass region was a violation of international law. And, he said the placement of Russian troops there constituted the beginning of an invasion.

Although he held out hope for a peaceful resolution through diplomacy, he said he did not believe a meeting with Lavrov would be productive at this time.

Kuleba, for his part, said Ukraine ""strongly"" believes that the time for imposing sanctions on Russia and its leadership is now, to prevent a further invasion.

""The world must respond with all its economic might to punish Russia for the crimes it has already committed and ahead of the crimes it plans to commit. Hit Russia's economy now, and hit it hard,"" he said.

""The measures also would target financial institutions, and Russian elites,"" the US leader added.

He declared that Moscow had flagrantly violated international law in what he called the “beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.”

Biden said more sanctions could be on the way if Russia's President Vladimir Putin proceeds further.

White House calls Russian moves on Ukraine an invasion

The White House has begun referring to Russian troop deployments in eastern Ukraine as an “invasion” after initially hesitating to use the term, a red line that US President Joe Biden has said will result in the US levying severe sanctions against Moscow.

“We think this is, yes, the beginning of an invasion, Russia’s latest invasion into Ukraine,” said Jon Finer, principal deputy national security advisor.

“An invasion is an invasion and that is what is underway.”

Lawmakers give Putin permission to use force outside Russia

UNSC to meet urgently on Ukraine crisis

The UN Security Council will hold an emergency meeting over Ukraine.

The meeting comes at the request of Ukraine, the United States and six other countries. Russia, which currently holds the rotating council presidency, has scheduled it for 9 pm [New York time.]

Yet undetermined is whether the meeting will be open or closed.

Ukrainian UN ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya said in a letter to his Russian counterpart that Kiev is requesting the urgent meeting because Putin's actions violate Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, the UN Charter, and a 2014 UN General Assembly resolution.

It is virtually certain the Security Council will not take any action or issue any statement because Russia has veto power.

In the meantime, Putin has announced his decision to recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics – established and occupied by Russian forces – as independent states, sending Russian forces into those provinces.[2] Further to this announcement, he passionately and violently denied Ukraine’s right to exist as a sovereign state, further fueling fears of an imminent war.[3] Yet by doing so, Putin undermined his own demand that Ukraine fulfill the Minsk accords of 2015 through Moscow’s ongoing refusal to implement the same accords. Though some regard this as a new escalation, this move may permit him to scale down the threat of war and its high risks to Russia while still claiming victory for his domestic audience.[4] While a renewed war would entail profound geopolitical repercussions, should war ensue it would in fact be a wholly fabricated war whose casus belli lies exclusively in the psyche of Putin and his circle, who can no longer rule Russia without the spectre of permanent war. Media subordinates, in total control of the Russian media, have made up all kinds of nonexistent threats such as a Ukrainian genocide of Russians, deployment of NATO missiles to Ukraine, and imminent membership of Ukraine in NATO to conjure up an imminent threat to Russia. This observation would also apply to the overall crisis even if war is averted. Putin will continue to paint Ukraine – which he still believes is not a real state – as the ‘bogeyman’ in order to impose a permanent state of siege inside Russia, and between Russia and the West.

We can say this with confidence by virtue of Russia’s unceasing efforts to conduct a false flag operation, as Putin likely did in 1999, when apartment buildings in Russia were mysteriously bombed, and as Hitler did in 1939. False flag operations are activities conducted by an aggressor acting in the guise of his intended victim to fabricate a pretext for war. False flag operations are used when there is no real casus belli and one must be manufactured in order to obtain domestic support for war.

Moscow’s demands were also clear because it has, for the last several months, presented them publicly and loudly in the form of ultimatums i.e. asserting that they could not be addressed to Moscow’s or anyone else’s satisfaction through diplomatic processes. Moscow demands that Ukraine and NATO formally reverse the 2008 decision, which made Ukraine eligible for eventual membership. Russia also demands that Ukraine promptly fulfil its obligations, even though Russia itself did not abide by the 2015 Minsk accords to end fighting during the initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014. Putin has made such demands without fulfilling his side of the accord just to arraign Ukraine, keep it under permanent pressure, and threaten the “secession” of the two provinces.[5]

Since these terms would force a revision of Ukraine’s constitution and convert it into a confederation—a kind of state that cannot enforce its sovereignty against determined neighbors—and thus undermine its sovereignty, if not its integrity. Moscow never fulfilled its end of the bargain and has now, by declaring Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states, revealed just how spurious its demands are.

Moscow’s demands also betray an intention to use Ukraine as a fulcrum upon which to destroy NATO and evict the U.S. from Europe – an old Soviet goal.[6] It also demands that no further states be admitted into NATO, that NATO withdraw all its military forces from states that joined after 1997 – i.e. Central and Eastern Europe – and that Washington renounce defense ties with Ukraine and Georgia. These demands, which were never meant to be presented as true negotiating points, are obviously unacceptable to Kyiv, Washington, and Brussels. They do, however, genuinely reflect Putin and his coterie’s objectives. Moreover, as Lawrence Freedman has now observed, “the issues at stake are so fundamental that they were never going to be handled by carefully crafted proposals that give away little while appearing generous. No set of institutions and agreements designed to deal with disputes of this kind, and stop them getting out of hand, could accommodate Russia in its current mood and sense of deep grievance, without jeopardizing the part of the European security system that is performing as it should at the moment – NATO.”[7]

Those close to Putin, mainly KGB veterans, have long proclaimed themselves to be at war with the West, not least over Ukraine, since their attempt to subvert it in 2004-05 failed.[8] Indeed, that is when they declared this war among themselves and the Russian military.[9] They believe the West to be decrepit, weak, and corruptible. Indeed, Russian diplomats have stated their belief that they can buy anyone they want in the West.[10] They do not fear sanctions since they expect them anyway, and previous sanctions have been exploited by them for their benefit and that of their families.

Thus, they and particularly Putin remain intent on preserving their power by any and all means, including outright war. Their goal is a reunified Russian empire, where Ukraine’s sovereignty is destroyed and its territory is either largely or wholly annexed to Russia, with Russia being recognized as a great power, i.e. empire. Putin, after all, has said on numerous occasions that the entire Soviet Union was “historical Russia.”[11] By the same token, he has also frequently argued that Ukraine is really Russia, therefore its independence and westward inclination represents both a repudiation of Moscow’s narrative of Russian history and, more to the point, of its rule. Further evidence of Putin’s intention to destroy any vestige of an independent Ukrainian state is discernible in the fact that Moscow plans to launch an extensive campaign of arrests and assassinations of any and all conceivable independent Ukrainian leaders after its expected victory.[12] That expected victory appears to entail an encirclement and ensuing occupation of Kyiv that will end any prospect of a Westernized Ukraine that Putin et al may well perceive as “a Western aircraft carrier parked just across from … southern Russia.”[13]

Ukraine’s repudiation of Russia, westward inclination, desire for membership in NATO and the EU, and its democracy, all of which Putin believes is fomented by the West, is particularly galling for several reasons. Putin and his entourage now believe that only by asserting Russia as a great power, i.e. empire, can they arrest the growing popular disaffection with the stagnant economy, Covid-19 pandemic, etc. and preserve their power. Moreover, Putin increasingly isolated in his palace “bunker” sees imperial restoration as his legacy and mission. It has long been the case that the structure of his autocracy – which ever more resembles that of his predecessors –incentivizes the structures of force (Silovye Struktury) to present fabricated worst-case scenarios or threat assessments that they know to be false or tailored to the boss’ prejudices.[14] And as regards Ukraine, the structures of force have diligently fulfilled the command for such tailored or faked threat assessments.[15] Putin thus evidently believes, against all reason, that Russian forces would be welcomed in Ukraine as “liberators”. At the same time, he apparently views this war as a “sacred responsibility” of his on behalf of Russia.[16]

But there are also deeper and tragically more irrational factors involved in this fabricated war for it is clear that Putin’s motives for this war reside in his 20 plus year obsession with recovering Ukraine and preserving his power and “legacy”. First, we must deal with the fabricated hysteria and obsessions now driving Russian policy. As many have pointed out, NATO membership is not an option for Ukraine.[17] The West does not control its government. There are no missiles in Ukraine. NATO is not threatening or trying to threaten Russia. Certainly, there is no “genocide” in the Donbas or anywhere else. Thus, there is no threat or casus belli justifying Russian actions. All these charges manifest Russia’s manufactured hysteria about Ukraine that reflects Putin and his entourage’s obsessions and irrationalities. In this context, we should remember that whenever Russia attributes negative behavior to its enemies, it is really revealing its own actual or impending behavior. In other words, Russia, like paranoiacs, is displaying a symptom of that disease, namely projection.

The penchant for projection reflects not only Putin’s obsession about the West and Ukraine, but also the institutionalized paranoia of his system that has restored much of the traditional autocratic state. Putin and his team are clearly and deeply aware of the fundamental illegitimacy of their position and power. To preserve their status they must restore the empire, the necessary corollary of autocracy in Russian history, and the accompanying belief or actual reality of permanent warfare with the West. An independent pro-Western Ukraine and, a fortiori, a NATO and/or EU member represents both a repudiation and permanent challenge to Putin’s projects. Hence the fabrication of a crisis in the belief that this will force the West to take Russia seriously and accept its self-valuation as a great power or empire. Ultimately, the real purpose of this endeavor is not only to restore the empire, but also to impress upon other audiences that Putin and his team’s hysteria and obsessions represent a reality to which they must accommodate themselves. This delusion resembles the Habsburg Empire’s obsession with proving itself as a great power in 1914, which ended tragically.

We can foresee another tragedy since neither Washington, nor NATO, nor the EU, nor any other European state accepts Russia’s demands, or self-valuation, for they all realize that to do so not only sacrifices Ukraine to Russian imperialism, but it also returns us to spheres of influence, the bipolarity of the Cold War, and even possibly a real war in Europe. They all clearly understand that acceptance of Russia’s demands would undermine their sovereignty and their security. Therefore, Putin has failed – though he probably does not accept this – to split the NATO alliance. If anything, Putin has generated a new spirit of solidarity among members, though he is likely betting on this being an evanescent sentiment that he can weaken after his expected victory.[18] NATO’s interests qua alliance are also clear. Under no circumstances will it accept formalized Russian vetoes over who may join or what NATO may do to defend its neighbors against threats to their security. Even those members who still cannot envision a militarized Europe will not accept those constraints upon NATO. Nevertheless, some European officials and governments apparently still take issue with American intelligence assessments of an imminent invasion.[19]

Many countries are still reluctant to impose truly stringent sanctions or even facilitate defense assistance for Ukraine’s defenses. This is particularly the case for Germany and Italy.[20] While the EU clearly wishes to expand its membership base, ultimately including Ukraine, and perceives itself as a beacon of democratic values, it has long been quite impotent regarding security issues. The behavior of Germany, France, and Italy – all of whom have tried to make independent deals with Moscow – reveals Russian successes that have encouraged Moscow to discount American or Western hostility in the aforementioned belief that they can buy back influence later.

It is the U.S. leadership role in NATO that explains the greater unity there. But even here, despite Washington’s opposition to the recrudescence of a Russian empire and determination to protect NATO as the key European security provider and main vehicle for U.S. leadership in Europe, it is unwilling – as are most NATO members – to flood Ukraine with weapons, particularly air defenses. This reluctance to act decisively against Moscow clearly drives Ukrainian President Zelensky’s rebukes of Western governments for their failure to assist Ukraine.[21] It is this absence of a genuine solidarity on the part of European states that enables Putin to believe that he ultimately can launch endless attacks on European governments, even in their home countries, and on the overall international order with impunity. Failure to impose draconian punishment upon Russia for its aggression against Ukraine in 2014 has helped bring us to this pass where European security as a whole, if not global order in general, is at stake.

The idea of a rules-based or liberal international order obviously strikes many as a fanciful, if not delusionary idea. But if we renounce that idea and order because of our fears of antagonizing Moscow and/or Beijing, then we will return to an international order that is Hobbesian, anarchic, and based on force. Russia’s state sponsored Valdai Club, issued a report in the wake of the original invasion of Ukraine called “New Rules or No Rules?” accurately depicting what awaits us if we fail to deter or defeat Russia’s impending aggression.[22] As Henry Kissinger states, when the international community’s strongest priority has been peace, it has then fallen victim to blackmailing states who use the threat of war to get their way.

This is what we now face. Nobody should have any illusions that Ukraine represents Putin’s last territorial demand in Europe. Russia’s demands indicate its ambition to restore the Cold War’s bipolarity in Europe, and simultaneously empire, without which its current Putinist system cannot survive. Russian officials and diplomats, since the 1990s, have regularly denied the integrity and sovereignty of every East European state, not just Ukraine.[23] For example,

In both Ukraine and Moldova, Russians push for federalization or “special status” formulas in the negotiation formats regarding these nations’ Russian-dominated breakaway regions – Donbas and Transnistria. Federalization projects on the conditions that could get the Kremlin’s backing would become an institutionally guaranteed lever for Moscow to influence and, whenever necessary, block independent policy-making in Ukraine and Moldova. In the case of Georgia, Russia pushes for Tbilisi to sign non-use of force agreements with Moscow’s proxy regimes in Abkhazia and Tskhinvali Region/South Ossetia in order to present them as sovereign international actors, undermine the concept of Georgia’s territorial integrity and avoid Russia itself being designated as a side of the conflict with Georgia.[24]

So we must take them, as do East European governments, at their word or ambition. Similarly, Putin and his subordinates have recently again raised the issue of deploying weapons and missiles in Latin America, specifically Cuba and Venezuela.[25]

Therefore, we stand at a crossroads. One way leads back to the rule of the jungle and the other preserves the idea of order where disputes, even serious ones, are resolved by diplomacy and negotiations. But we also have the ability to support Ukraine here. Putin evidently thinks he can either threaten or launch a “Blitzkrieg” and win everything he wants at minimal or bearable cost. But to many, if not most, outside observers he has seriously miscalculated because Ukraine will fight back making this a protracted war. And, in this context, Russian history teaches us that protracted war puts the stability of the state at serious risk. Can an isolated Russia, run by aging KGB veterans with blinkered knowledge of the outside world and presiding over a stagnant and worsening economy prevail under such circumstances? Only an uninformed and rash observer who is unfamiliar with Russian history would eagerly take this bet.

Rosen', 'Stephen Kotkin', 'Andrei Soldatov', 'Irina Borogan']",2022-02-25,"Russian forces have struck targets across Ukraine and seized key facilities and swaths of territory. The Ukrainian military is no match for this Russian juggernaut. Although some reports suggest Ukrainian troops have rebuffed attacks in certain parts of the country, it seems more likely that Russian President Vladimir Putin will decide just how far Russia goes into Ukraine. As a retired Russian-speaking CIA operations officer who served in Central Asia and managed agency counterinsurgency operations, I did not think Putin would have attacked Ukraine unless he had already devised a reliable end game, given the costs of an intractable conflict. But Putin’s best-laid plans might easily unravel in the face of popular Ukrainian national resistance and an insurgency.

If Russia limits its offensive to the east and south of Ukraine, a sovereign Ukrainian government will not stop fighting. It will enjoy reliable military and economic support from abroad and the backing of a united population. But if Russia pushes on to occupy much of the country and install a Kremlin-appointed puppet regime in Kyiv, a more protracted and thorny conflagration will begin. Putin will face a long, bloody insurgency that could spread across multiple borders, perhaps even reaching into Belarus to challenge Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, Putin’s stalwart ally. Widening unrest could destabilize other countries in Russia’s orbit, such as Kazakhstan, and even spill into Russia itself. When conflicts begin, unpredictable and unimaginable outcomes can become all too real. Putin may not be prepared for the insurgency—or insurgencies—to come.

WINNER’S REMORSE

Many a great power has waged war against a weaker one, only to get bogged down as a result of its failure to have a well-considered end game. This lack of foresight has been especially palpable in troubled occupations. It was one thing for the United States to invade Vietnam in 1965, Afghanistan in 2001, and Iraq in 2003; likewise for the Soviet Union to enter Afghanistan in 1979. It was an altogether more difficult task to persevere in those countries in the face of stubborn insurgencies.

Russia can likely seize as much of Ukraine’s territory as it chooses. But plans to pacify Ukraine will require far more than the reserve forces Putin has suggested might occupy the territory as “peacekeepers” after initial combat objectives are met. Thanks to Putin’s aggression, anti-Russian fervor and homegrown nationalism have surged in Ukraine. Ukrainians have spent the last eight years planning, training, and equipping themselves for resisting a Russian occupation. Ukraine understands that no U.S. or NATO forces will come to its rescue on the battlefield. Its strategy doesn’t depend on turning back a Russian invasion, but rather in bleeding Moscow so as to make occupation untenable.

When conflicts begin, unpredictable and unimaginable outcomes can become all too real.

Any future insurgency will benefit from Ukraine’s geography. The country is bordered by four NATO states: Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia. Belarus, a Russian ally, is itself bordered by Poland on the west and another NATO member—Lithuania—on the north. These long borders offer the United States and NATO an enduring way to support Ukrainian resistance and a long-term insurgency and to stoke unrest in Belarus should the United States and its allies choose to covertly aid opposition to Lukashenko’s regime.

Moldova, to the southwest of Ukraine, is also an intriguing player. Although nominally neutral (neutrality is written into its constitution), Moldova has cooperated in the past with the United States and NATO; it has a somewhat frigid relationship with Moscow thanks to ongoing tensions over the breakaway republic of Transnistria, a narrow strip of land along the Moldovan-Ukrainian border. Moscow props up this separatist entity, which is garrisoned by Russian troops in the name of “peacekeeping.” Its role in Transnistria is pushing Moldova toward the West. Last November, Maia Sandu, a former Moldovan prime minister, defeated the Russia-backed incumbent president. Moldova is not likely to overtly provoke the Kremlin, but Sandu might be willing to covertly cooperate with Ukraine’s resistance.

As the United States learned in Vietnam and Afghanistan, an insurgency that has reliable supply lines, ample reserves of fighters, and sanctuary over the border can sustain itself indefinitely, sap an occupying army’s will to fight, and exhaust political support for the occupation at home. Russia would also have to think twice before trying to chase insurgents across the border into Poland, for instance, since such actions could trigger war with NATO.

LINES OF SUPPORT

The United States will invariably be a major and essential source of backing for a Ukrainian insurgency. During the Obama and Trump administrations, the United States acted with restraint in responding to Russian cyberattacks, disinformation, and military expansionism. Washington did not want to unleash a spiral of escalation it could not control, risking Russian reprisals against U.S. banks, businesses, and infrastructure. The Biden administration, however, has so far been less tentative in its dealings with Russia. To counter Russian moves, it has exposed Russia-associated hackers and recovered funds stolen through cyberattack ransoms, extradited Russian oligarchs to stand trial in the United States, and declassified intelligence on Russian plans in Ukraine to unify support among allies and shape the media narrative.

If a viable, independent Ukraine remains standing, whether ruled from Kyiv or Lviv (the largest city in the western part of the country), the United States and its NATO allies can openly aid in its in defense with weapons, training, and cash. It’s reasonable to deduce that the CIA’s legal charter to partner with foreign intelligence counterparts has allowed it to provide training and materials to its Ukrainian partners for years, just as U.S. military trainers have worked with and supplied their Ukrainian counterparts.

This aid will have to become covert if Russia seizes the government and fully occupies the country. Military support for action against a sovereign country with which the United States is not at war has to be clandestine, much like U.S. support for the Afghan mujahideen against the Soviet Union in the 1980s, for Iraq’s Kurds prior to the 2003 invasion, and, less successfully, for rebels in Syria a decade ago. Attacking behind enemy lines would require a presidential covert action finding funded by Congress. Of course, a version of this authorization probably already exists and might at most need modification by the White House as a new congressional Memorandum of Notification to accommodate the shifting circumstances.

Supporting an insurgency is in the CIA’s DNA. Its forerunner, the Office of Strategic Services, came into its own during World War II through supporting resistance forces in France, the Netherlands, and East Asia. The CIA’s recent experience in supporting and fighting insurgencies in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria prepares it well for opposing Russia’s modern, conventional forces. The United States can help Ukrainian insurgents in hitting targets with the greatest military value and psychological impact.

A Yahoo News report in January described a covert CIA training program for elite Ukrainian special operations forces and other intelligence personnel that was launched in 2015 by the Obama administration following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. According to the report, the effort included the deployment of CIA paramilitary officers to Ukraine. Such programs mature over time as trust grows between the trainers and their foreign counterparts and as the recipients teach what they have learned to others.

U.S. and Ukrainian officials have long planned for this day. In all likelihood, a covert program to help organize the resistance to Russia already has communications infrastructure, intelligence collection capabilities, and operational plans in place. And the tactics developed to support defensive operations against an invader can transition to those aimed at hobbling an occupying force.

FORCES UNLEASHED

An anti-Russian insurgency will no doubt face obstacles and endure setbacks. Putin is aware of the possibility of Ukrainian resistance to a wider Russian occupation. U.S. officials have alleged that the Russian government maintains lists of Ukrainian political and security officials it would arrest—or even assassinate—once it has seized the country and lists of pro-Kremlin figures it would hope to install. Russia would seek to undermine any insurgency by moving expeditiously to eliminate likely leaders and enablers of the resistance.

An insurgency against Russian forces in Ukraine will take time to gather steam and achieve its goals. Resistance movements can take years—not months—to mature, organize, and achieve a meaningful offensive tempo. Even as an American, I could have easily walked the streets or dined in the cafes of Kabul in 2002 and Baghdad in 2003 without a care in the world. But a year or two later, I had to wear body armor and be accompanied by a protective security detail that ferried me around in heavily armored vehicles, hoping to avoid ambushes and improvised explosive device strikes.

Russia’s military advantages will diminish as the enemy it fights becomes a decentralized and mobile resistance.

Ukrainian insurgents will have to reckon with advances in modern technology that make their work more difficult. During World War II, the Vietnam War, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, organized bands of partisans could disperse to the countryside or into the hills. Escaping the reach of occupying forces is harder now thanks to drones, satellites, and thermal imagery. Insurgents will undertake cross-border raids but sustained military operations further behind enemy lines will require help from those living in such areas—people leading ostensibly normal lives who secretly have access to weapons and secure communications and can thereby evade Russian detection. The Russians will label the attacks of these operatives as acts of terrorism while people in the West will applaud them as the deeds of freedom fighters.

Early on, it is likely the Russians will uncover many rings of insurgents, quickly unmasking the insurgency’s initial leaders after years of Russian intelligence collection. But insurgencies adapt swiftly—far faster than the large, structured armies they are fighting—and new leaders emerge molded by their adverse early experiences. Their agility becomes an enormous advantage.

Russia would hope to either limit its incursion to parts of Ukraine whose populations might be more inclined to accept Russian rule or act with such lightning speed so as to seize and pacify the country before a viable resistance can find its legs. But Russia’s military advantages over Ukrainian forces will diminish as the enemy it fights changes from an organized army to a decentralized and mobile resistance. Occupation forces will be subject to harassing attacks designed to both inflict casualties and undermine military discipline. An influence campaign replete with horrific images of carnage—of both civilian Ukrainian and Russian military deaths—will aim to sow antiwar sentiment in Russia and counter Moscow’s narrative that their forces were welcomed as liberators by grateful locals.

Putin’s motivations in starting this war of choice remain the subject of great debate. They may become clearer in the coming days and weeks as Russia continues its offensive. But if his aims are maximalist—redrawing borders or even toppling the current government—an insurgency is inevitable. For both Putin and his enemies, it will be hard to control the forces that have now been unleashed.",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2022-02-25/coming-ukrainian-insurgency
5,5235c820-b1d7-43f4-b690-af8c62473d80,['Robert E. Kelly'],2022-02-26,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has launched an attack on Ukraine.

What began as a limited incursion by Russia’s armed forces is now a full-scale invasion. Western intelligence agencies and various European leaders, including British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, have for several weeks warned that the hostilities could eventually become the largest conflict on the continent since World War II.

Most of the impact will be felt in Europe, even if the war widens. NATO will likely expand defense spending. Russia will be heavily sanctioned and increasingly isolated from the world economy.

In East Asia, however, the immediate fallout of Russian aggression will be minor. Russia itself is geopolitically weak in the region. Only a fifth of its population lives in the vast Siberian space between the Ural Mountains and the Pacific Ocean. Russia’s ability to project hard power in East Asia is limited. It is unlikely to repeat the asymmetric tactics it has used against Ukraine and other neighboring post-Soviet countries, because borders in East Asia are more fixed and agreed-upon than in Eastern Europe. Putin is also mostly concerned with European-area disputes. His goal in Asia seems primarily to maintain good relations with China while he tangles with NATO.

There is one unique area of concern for Tokyo. Japan is in a long-running territorial dispute with Russia over the Kuril Islands. There is some similarity there to Russia’s many territorial disputes along its European borders. But Russia already controls the four islands in dispute, so there is no obvious revanchist threat. That “frozen conflict” seems likely to remain frozen.

Instead, the real Asian concern from the Ukraine crisis is a territory-snatching precedent that China might exploit in the East and South China Seas.

Putin’s speeches and writings over the past two decades as Russian leader have emphasized unfairness in the post-Cold War European settlement, particularly with the independence of Ukraine. This year’s crisis is the zenith of Putin’s long-running obsession with these issues.

The collapse of the Soviet Union was a dramatic setback for Russian national power. In just three years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Russia shed two layers of empire — the Eastern European “allies” of the Cold War-era Warsaw Pact, like Poland and Romania, and then the Soviet Union’s own non-Russian nations, such as Lithuania and Ukraine, which also became independent.

Putin was trained in the old Soviet system and once called the USSR’s collapse a “geopolitical catastrophe.” He has never accepted the loss of prestige associated with the post-Cold War revision of the European order at Russia’s expense. He and the Russian foreign policy community suffer from intense post-imperial nostalgia, even now, 30 years later.

Putin was unable to halt the eastward march of NATO and the European Union in the 1990s and 2000s. He never seemed to grasp that his nostalgia for Soviet dominance in Eastern Europe is precisely what drove those countries toward the West. These states, including Ukraine, sought safety after 45 years of Russian domination.

Putin has fought this by arguing that Ukraine is not really a country at all. It is historically a part of Russia, his argument goes, and that its post-Soviet independence is an inexplicable happenstance. And just as in Eastern Europe, this belligerence and imperial nostalgia is now fueling a counter-reaction in flourishing Ukrainian nationalism.

One widely touted response to a Russian takeover is a popular insurgency. That would turn his quick land-grab into an unwinnable quagmire along the lines of the American war in Vietnam or the USSR’s own disastrous counter-insurgency in Afghanistan in the 1980s.

Instead, Putin has launched his aggression by cloaking it with the modern language of liberal values and “peacekeeping.”

First, he declared two eastern districts of Ukraine — Donetsk and Luhansk — to be independent states. Their independence was necessary, because Ukrainians were murdering ethnic Russians there in a genocide, according to Russian state media. Russian troops in these regions would therefore be peacekeepers, and the invasion itself is to “denazify” Ukraine. This is the Russian narrative.

What is Putin’s strategy?

Should Putin choose to occupy Ukraine indefinitely, there are significant risks.

First, it could devolve into a counter-insurgency quagmire if the Ukrainian population resists. Ukraine also borders NATO states that would allow the organization to support a cross-border insurgency, much as Pakistan provided a staging base and safe zone for Islamist guerillas to fight the Soviet Red Army in Afghanistan in the 1980s.

Second, openly violating Ukraine’s sovereignty permanently risks alienating China, whose support, or at least forbearance, Putin desperately needs. Putin has tried hard to dance around this — hence his manipulation of ethnic Russians in Ukraine, the independence proclamations of Donetsk and Luhansk, and the outlandish talk of Ukrainian “Nazis.”

Third, sustained open warfare makes it far more likely that the world would aggressively isolate and sanction Russia. So far, Western countries have resisted the harshest sanction — expelling Russia from the SWIFT financial transaction system.

But such serious punishment, to delink Russia from the dollar, is likely if journalists start broadcasting war imagery from Ukraine — intense military violence, civilian massacres, sieges of Ukrainian cities and so on.

An alternative for Putin might be a westward, rolling series of minor land-grabs, puppet states and frozen conflicts. Putin has experience ginning up these sorts of subversive moves that avoid the appearance of open warfare, yet allow him to project Russian power and undercut the westward drift of post-Soviet states.

In Moldova, Putin’s Russia has supported a breakaway republic known as Transnistria since 1992. In Georgia, it has supported the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia since 2008. It has tilted toward secessionism in Azerbaijan. In Belarus, Putin has bullied the leadership into permitting indefinite Russian Army deployments. In Ukraine, it annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and supported insurgents in the Donbas region.

This model of stirring up local trouble and then supporting “peacekeepers” or mini-breakaway states might be an alternative to a full-scale Ukraine invasion. It would allow Putin to drag out the Ukraine crisis for months, so that it fades from the headlines and preempts the worst sanctions. Putin could then later push for further rebellious secession elsewhere in Ukraine’s east.

Could Putin’s oblique revanchism be repeated in Asia?

Putin’s revisionism in Europe, at least until the invasion proper just a few days ago, might be best described as “salami slicing” — taking a little here and a little there, always too little to avoid a major global reaction. These moves are usually covered with a narrative of violence against ethnic Russians or historical “explanations” about Russia’s role in the region.

China is the only country in Asia that might conceivably pursue a protracted course like this. The other capable states in the region are either democratic without regional imperialist ambitions, underdeveloped or both. Indonesia has tangled with East Timor, for example, but that has not spiraled into regional conflict. Japan, South Korea and the Philippines are highly unlikely to pursue military revisionism.

Taiwan is the often mentioned concern in Asia. If Putin snatches all of Ukraine, would Chinese President Xi Jinping try the same? Probably not.

First, China cannot salami slice its way into Taiwan, because Taiwan is separated from the mainland by water, which makes for robust borders.

So China could only attack Taiwan through a massive amphibious invasion that global public opinion would immediately read it as a major war. Putin’s earlier tactics of oblique territorial penetration will not work in the East China Sea. There is also an intense dispute over whether China could actually mount the large open-water operation necessary to conquer Taiwan.

Additionally, the United States is committed to Taiwan far more than the West is to Ukraine. Ukraine is not a member of NATO, and it is unlikely to become one. Western publics strongly oppose direct military intervention and war against Russia. Everyone knows this, hence the West’s ability to deter Russia in Ukraine in recent months has been weak.

Taiwan is different. Although it has no formal alliance with the United States, it has a long-standing American relationship and wide sympathy both in the U.S. foreign policy community and among U.S. regional allies. Everyone realizes that a Chinese move on Taiwan would be a major revision of the Asian order that has ensured peace and prosperity for decades. The Taiwanese would fight hard; they are better prepared than Ukraine; the Americans would probably join; regional U.S. allies, most obviously Japan, would probably get involved as well.

And, importantly, China is ideologically committed to sovereignty, which undergirds its claims to restive areas such as Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Tibet. If China’s leaders reject sovereignty and borders as Putin has done in Eastern Europe, it risks opening ideological space for China’s many minorities to demand rights or succession. Bullying Taiwan into “voluntary” unification is its ideal outcome.

The future of Chinese revisionism

For sure, China has engaged in salami slicing tactics in the South China Sea — grabbing islets and shoals, building bases on them, and declaring air and maritime control zones. This is also troublesome, but far less important than moves on Ukraine or Taiwan, which are densely populated land masses. The stand-off over the South China Sea will continue, but it is different enough from Putin’s rolling land-grabs to mean that Ukraine is likely not a model there.

The real issue is Taiwan. China, like Russia, has ginned up fake narratives about the dispute. It lies to its own people about the desire of Taiwanese to “rejoin” China, but that has been unpersuasive. It is quite clear the Taiwanese value their democracy more than unification. Otherwise unity would have happened long ago.

The core concern, rather, is deterrence. Do the Chinese believe the Taiwanese, Americans and others will fight for Taiwan? And here the regional differences and particulars of the dispute matter a lot. Ukraine’s subversion, while tragic, is not seen as an existential challenge to the European order. An invasion of Taiwan would be, though, because it would be a massive military operation — given Taiwan’s island geography — by a power far larger and more capable than Russia. So the likelihood that the United States and its allies would fight is much higher; hence deterrence is stronger, blunting the notion that China will learn from Ukraine that it can freely attack Taiwan.

Finally, it should be noted that Putin’s strategy is self-limiting. Absorbing damaged, economically depressed breakaway states and keeping them in perpetual crisis means Russian subsidies to them, burdening an already corrupt and inefficient Russian economy.

A Chinese conquest of Taiwan or other nationalistic people in Asia would be costly, and China already spends more on internal than external security. The cost-benefit of Putin’s invasion is balance-negative — apart from the nationalist satisfactions — and the Chinese leadership has always been much more cautious about such things than risk-taking Putin.

A WAR IS happening in Ukraine after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced an attack on the country.

Putin launched a broad Russian military offensive targeting Ukraine at about 5am local time (3am Irish time).

Weeks of intense diplomacy and the imposition of Western sanctions on Russia failed to deter Putin from invading.
