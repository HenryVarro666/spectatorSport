WARSAW, March 23 (Reuters) - Poland is expelling 45 Russian diplomats suspected of working for Russian intelligence, the foreign ministry said on Wednesday.

Russia said the accusations were baseless.

Relations between Russia and Central European countries that once formed part of its sphere of influence have long been fraught but the invasion of Ukraine has significantly increased fear and suspicion about Moscow's intentions.

""In total, 45 people with varying diplomatic status... were ordered to leave the territory of the Republic of Poland within 5 days,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Lukasz Jasina told a news conference.

One person had been given 48 hours to leave, he added.

""Russia is our neighbour, it will not disappear from the map of Europe, but the aggression towards Ukraine proves that it is an unfriendly state, and even hostile to Poland.""

The 45 diplomats being expelled represented around half of those currently working at the embassy, he said.

Earlier, Special Services Spokesman Stanislaw Zaryn told reporters that 45 people had been identified by Poland's Internal Security Agency as working for Russian intelligence.

The Russian ambassador to Warsaw was summoned to the foreign ministry. Afterwards, he said that there is no basis for the accusations made against the officials.

Russia also has the right to take further steps, Andreev added, without going into detail about what those might be.

Poland is expelling 45 Russian diplomats it accuses of being spies, describing it as a response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Russia’s policies toward Poland and its allies. The move, which comes as President Biden prepares to travel to Belgium and Poland to bolster the Western alliance, prompted Russia to warn it will retaliate.

“Poland expelled 45 Russian spies pretending to be diplomats,” Poland’s interior minister, Mariusz Kaminski, said Wednesday on Twitter. “With full consistency and determination, we are breaking up the agents of the Russian secret services in our country.”

Stanislaw Zaryn, a spokesman for Poland’s security services, told The Washington Post that the 45 included individuals known to be working for Russia’s secret services, along with others who, while benefiting from diplomatic status in Poland, aided the work of Russian secret services.

“Russian services are increasingly on the offensive,” Zaryn said Wednesday in a news conference. “They are acting more and more aggressively against Poland.”

The move elicited pointed criticism from Kremlin officials, who vowed to respond.

Russia’s ambassador to Poland, Sergey Andreev, told journalists after he was summoned to the Polish Foreign Ministry on Wednesday that Russia would not suspend formal diplomatic relations with Poland. But he said Moscow would retaliate with measures to expel Polish diplomats, according to Russia’s state-run news agency, Tass.

He said the allegations against the diplomats are groundless and that embassy employees have been doing normal diplomatic and trade work.

The diplomats will have a maximum of five days to leave Poland, Andreev said, adding: “They will have to go. This is a sovereign decision by the Polish side, and they have the right to their own decision.”

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharvova said Russia would “respond appropriately” if its diplomats were expelled from Poland, according to state-owned news outlet RIA Novosti.

Separately, Polish security services announced they had arrested a Polish national last Thursday who was suspected of spying for Russia. The suspect worked in a registry office in Warsaw, Poland’s capital, and had access to sensitive documents, the Internal Security Agency said.

Poland, shares a border with Ukraine and with Russia’s exclave of Kaliningrad. The country has taken in more than 2 million Ukrainian refugees. It also hosts NATO troops in its military bases.

Biden’s visit to Poland was added to the itinerary of his Europe trip only in the past few days, reflecting the country’s position at the center of an intensifying refugee crisis. In Warsaw, he is expected to pledge more U.S. humanitarian aid, discuss the emergency with Polish leaders and potentially meet Ukrainians who have fled their homeland.

Poland’s Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski has said the European Union member had “expelled 45 Russian spies pretending to be diplomats”.

“We are dismantling the Russian special services network in our country,” Kaminski wrote on Twitter on Wednesday.

Russian ambassador to Poland Sergey Andreyev confirmed the expulsions.

“There are no grounds for these kinds of accusations,” he said, adding that Russia reserved the right to take retaliatory measures.

Polish Foreign Ministry spokesman Lukasz Jasina said the Russians were being given five days to leave the country, with the exception of one particularly dangerous individual who must leave in 48 hours.

“Russia is our neighbour and will not disappear from the map of Europe, but the aggression against Ukraine proves that it is a hostile state, and even hostile to Poland,” Jasina said at a news briefing in Warsaw.

He did not give a specific reason for why the alleged spies were being expelled but suggested that they pose an especially grave threat at a time when Poland is accepting large numbers of refugees from Ukraine.

“The illegal activities of these diplomats can also pose a threat to those people who left their country to flee the war and found protection in our country,” he said.

Jasina also said: “Poland, in coordination with our allies, decided to significantly reduce the diplomatic staff of the Embassy of the Russian Federation.”

The list of spies

The announcement came hours after Poland’s counter-espionage service ABW identified the suspected spies and called on the foreign ministry to expel them.

ABW spokesman Stanislaw Zaryn told reporters on Wednesday that the list of suspects had been transferred to the foreign ministry.

“The Internal Security Agency has identified 45 people – officers of Russian secret services and persons associated with them who had diplomatic status in Poland,” Zaryn said.

“The list was forwarded to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it includes officers of the special services of the Russian Federation and people cooperating with them … people who conducted intelligence activities against Poland, but also against our allies,” he said.

Zaryn also said the ABW “has detained a Polish national on suspicion of espionage for the Russian secret services”.

“The detainee worked in the archives of Warsaw’s registry office,” he said. “The activity of the suspect posed a threat to both (the) internal and external security of Poland.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/23/poland-identifies-45-russian-diplomats-as-suspected-spies

WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland ordered the expulsion of 45 Russians whom the government identified as intelligence officers using their diplomatic status as cover to operate in the country, officials said Wednesday.

Poland’s Internal Security Agency said it has asked the Foreign Ministry to urgently remove the Russians, who were described as a danger to Poland’s security, from the country.

“These are people who ... operate using their diplomatic status, but in reality conduct intelligence activities against Poland,” said Stanislaw Zaryn, the state security spokesman.

Russian Ambassador Sergei Andreev was summoned to the Foreign Ministry and given a note informing him of the expulsion of 45 employees of the embassy and Russia’s trade mission to Poland.

Andreev, who is not among those being expelled, lashed out at the decision, telling reporters after the meeting that those being kicked out of Poland “were carrying out normal diplomatic and trade activity.” He said Russia has the right to respond on a reciprocal basis.

Polish Foreign Ministry spokesman Lukasz Jasina said the Russians were being given five days to leave the country, with the exception of one particularly dangerous man who must leave in 48 hours.

“Russia has been waging a barbaric war against Ukraine for over three weeks. We and other Western countries are treated as a key enemy,” Jasina said.

“Further tolerating this type of illegal activity by Russian services would create a particular threat to Poland’s security, but also to our NATO and European Union allies, with whom we coordinate all such activities.”

He didn’t give a specific reason for why the alleged spies were being expelled but suggested that they pose an especially grave threat at a time that Poland is accepting large numbers of refugees from Ukraine.

“The illegal activities of these diplomats can also pose a threat to those people who left their country to flee the war and found protection in our country,” he said.

Zaryn, the state security spokesman, said the decision to expel them now was made “taking into account Russian aggression against Ukraine.”

He told The Associated Press that he was not aware of Poland ever having expelled so many intelligence agents at ones — a number that makes up about half of Russia’s diplomatic staff in Poland.

He said the agency’s work also showed that the Russian services are increasingly on the offensive and “are acting aggressively against Poland.”

Zaryn said in a separate statement that the security agency found that the activities of the 45 Russians have served “the objectives of the Russian undertakings designed to undermine the stability of Poland and its allies in the international arena and poses a threat to the interests and security of our country.”

The Polish state security service also said that it detained a Polish citizen on suspicion of espionage for the Russian secret services. The suspect, who was detained on March 17, worked in Warsaw’s registry office and had access to city archives.

“Given the nature of documents kept by those units, the activity of the suspect posed a threat to both internal and external security of Poland,” the agency said in a statement.

The Russian who was given only 48 hours to leave Poland had been in contact with the Polish suspect, Zaryn told the AP.

Just days after Russia invaded Ukraine, Poland also arrested a Spanish citizen of Russian origin suspected of conducting intelligence activities for Russia. The man was detained in Przemysl, a Polish border town where hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees have come through in recent weeks.

Poland’s security agency said the man was an agent for the Russian military intelligence, the GRU, and was “profiting from his status of journalist, which enabled him to freely travel around the world and Europe, including military conflict zones and territories marked with political tensions.”",https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-europe-poland-espionage-warsaw-b6d75f0e65287f7d6bb68d5e64ecd926
