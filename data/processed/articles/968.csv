Russian troops trying to surround the city of Kyiv are now at risk of getting surrounded themselves after Ukrainian forces went on the counter-attack, with footage showing a tank getting blown to smithereens and rocket artillery raining down on Putin's troops.

Heavy fighting is going on to both the west and east of Kyiv as Ukrainian troops - who have suffered through a month of dogged defending under heavy bombardment - are attempting to retake the initiative from Russian invaders by launching attacks of their own.

Makariv and Moschun, two cities to the west of the capital, have 'probably' been re-taken by Kyiv's troops - the British Ministry of Defence said overnight - meaning there is now a 'realistic possibility that Ukrainian forces are able to encircle Russian units at Bucha and Irpin'.

If those units - which include part of a 40-mile convoy spied near the Ukrainian capital in the early days of the war - do get surrounded, then they will be unable to reinforce or resupply themselves and may end up surrendering, inflicting one of the largest defeats on the Russian military of the entire war.

Ukraine has also forced back Russian troops to the east of the city, according to the Pentagon, driving them between 15 and 20 miles down the main highway in the direction of Chernihiv. Counter-attacks are also known to be underway at Mykolaiv and Kherson, in the south, and Izyum, in the north-east.

And on Thursday morning, Ukraine destroyed a Russian tank-carrier ship docked in the captured port city of Berdyansk - scoring a direct hit on the vessel which subsequently exploded. It marks the largest Russian ship lost so-far, and an embarrassing error for Putin because it was Russian state media that revealed its location.

At least 1,800 Russian vehicles have been destroyed in the invasion, according to independent monitoring groups, though Ukraine puts the figure far higher - more than 3,000, including cars and trucks

Ukrainian forces are counter-attacking to the west of Kyiv where Russian troops at Irpin and Bucha are in danger of getting surrounded, possibly forcing a mass-surrender, while attacks are also going on to the east of the city

NATO now estimates that Putin has lost up to 40,000 men during his invasion - killed, wounded and captured - representing more than a quarter of the total force he arrayed before giving the order to attack.

Observers and experts have been warning that losses that severe risk making parts of his army combat ineffective, meaning they will struggle to operate on the battlefield and will be vulnerable to Ukrainian counter-attack.

Russian offensives have been stalled on almost all fronts for days now, with the Pentagon saying earlier this week that Ukraine's generals - who have been skilled in defence - are now switching to offence, and are 'able and willing to take back territory' captured by Russia.

Ukraine's armed forces reported 250 aircraft flights in the last 24 hours, a marked increase from the day before.

There were also fierce exchanges of artillery fire in Irpin even as Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said 'the small city of Makariv and almost all of Irpin is already under the control of Ukrainian soldiers'.

What is clear is that Ukrainian civilians continue to bear the brunt of the war.

'There's going to have to be a further, massive scaling up of assistance within Ukraine in the coming weeks,' said WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan.

'I have never, myself, seen such complex needs, and so quickly in a crisis that has developed so fast,' he said. 'We have reached maybe, for once, an appropriate level of horror at what's happening in Ukraine.'

Ukraine's president made an impassioned plea for global street protests against Russia's bloody month-old invasion and for democratic leaders amassed in Brussels for emergency summits on Thursday to send more advanced weaponry.

In a late-night television address from the emptied streets of the besieged capital Kyiv, a defiant but visibly tired Volodymyr Zelensky appealed in English for the world to help ensure his nation's survival.

'The world must stop the war,' he said. 'Come from your offices, your homes, your schools and universities, come in the name of peace, come with Ukrainian symbols to support Ukraine, to support freedom, to support life.'

Addressing leaders of the G7, NATO and the European Union meeting in the Belgian capital, he called for a step-shift in weapons deliveries, including more advanced fighter jets, missile defence systems, tanks, armoured vehicles and anti-ship missiles.

Ukrainian counter-attacks are also underway in the south around Mykolaiv and Kherson, and in the north-east towards Izyum. The port in Berdyansk, which had been captured by Russian troops and was being used to unload reinforcements, has also been hit - destroying a landing ship

'Freedom must be armed,' he said bluntly, as a heavily armed guard kept watch close by - a stark reminder that Zelensky's own life, and the life of his nation, are in acute peril.

Zelensky admitted the last month had been 'long' and left him heartbroken, but he hailed Ukrainians' willingness to fight. 'This is a war for independence and we must win,' he said, flitting between Ukrainian, English and his native Russian. 'We will rebuild every city, we will bring the invaders to justice for every crime,' he said. 'All our people will live in a free Ukraine.'

His appeal came exactly one month after Russian tanks rolled over the border, bringing a conflict that has already killed thousands of Ukrainian civilians, and thousands more soldiers on both sides.

More than 10 million Ukrainians have fled their homes, as cities have faced sustained Russian bombardment from land, sea and air.

In the southern port city of Mariupol alone, 100,000 people are trapped without food, water or power and enduring fierce shelling by Russian forces.

In the city's hospital, local officials said staff have evacuated patients to the basement, where they are treated by candlelight beside 600 to 700 other residents seeking what little safety they can.

Experts say Russia's once-vaunted military has been bogged down by dogged resistance and has turned to long-range bombardment in the hope of breaking Ukrainian resolve.

Washington said Wednesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin's bombing campaign amounted to war crimes, escalating a confrontation between Moscow and the West that has rivalled the worst crises of the Cold War.

'We've seen numerous credible reports of indiscriminate attacks and attacks deliberately targeting civilians, as well as other atrocities,' US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.

'Based on information currently available, the US government assesses that members of Russia's forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine.'

So far the conflict has not spilt over into direct military conflagration between Russia and NATO, but Ukraine's allies fear that Moscow may up the ante with a chemical, biological or even tactical nuclear attack.

Facing mounting diplomatic and economic pressure, Putin's regime has responded by warning Russia could use nuclear weapons if it faces an 'existential threat'.

In the back-to-back Brussels summits, US President Joe Biden and other leaders are expected to bring pledges of more lethal weapons to Ukraine and more punishing sanctions for Russia's already crisis-wracked economy.

But they will also have to weigh how to deter further Russian escalation, without risking an all-out war with Russia.

NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has said the summit will see leaders agree to 'major increases of forces' on the alliance's eastern borders, including four new battle groups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia.

NATO officials believe that - armed with an arsenal of Western anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons - Ukrainian forces may have already killed as many as 15,000 Russian soldiers and wounded perhaps 30,000 to 40,000.

Putin's regime officially puts the number of Russian fallen at under 500, and has introduced draconian censorship laws to prevent independently verified news about what it calls a 'special military operation.'

Recent days have brought claims of Ukrainian forces not only repelling attacks from the much larger and much better armed Russian military, but launching counteroffensives and winning back territory around Kyiv.

To blunt the damage done by sanctions, Putin said Wednesday that Russia will only accept payments in rubles for gas deliveries to 'unfriendly countries', which include all European Union members.

The manoeuver sharpened growing debate in Europe - which is heavily dependent on Russian energy imports - about possible bans on Russian oil and gas.

Moscow has warned an embargo would prompt a 'collapse' of the global energy market.

While Europe has appeared fractured on the question of an oil embargo, there are also signs of fissures within Putin's regime.

Moscow confirmed that Anatoly Chubais - a former Kremlin chief of staff who oversaw liberal economic reforms in the 1990s - quit his post as a Putin advisor. He has reportedly fled the country in protest at the war.

Russia still has a vital friend in China, which dismissed suggestions that Moscow should be expelled from the G20 group of countries.

But Scott Morrison, prime minister of G20 member Australia, said he believed that Putin attending a leaders' summit in Indonesia later this year would be 'a step too far.'

Nearly a month into the invasion, peace talks have agreed on daily humanitarian corridors for refugees, and Ukraine says it is willing to countenance some Russian demands subject to a national referendum.

But it has refused to bow to demands to disarm and renounce its pro-Western ambitions.

Russian forces did not make any major advances on March 22 and Ukrainian forces conducted local counterattacks northwest of Kyiv and around Mykolayiv. Russian forces around Kyiv and other major cities are increasingly prioritizing long-range bombardment after the failure of Russian ground offensives but are unlikely to force major cities to surrender in this manner. Russian forces did not conduct any offensive operations toward the northeastern Ukrainian cities of Chernihiv, Sumy, or Kharkiv in the last 24 hours. Russian forces continued to further reduce the Mariupol pocket.

Key Takeaways

Russian forces are likely moving to a phase of protracted bombardment of Ukrainian cities due to the failure of Russia’s initial campaign to encircle and seize Kyiv and other major cities.

Ukrainian forces conducted successful localized counterattacks northwest of Kyiv.

Russian forces in northeastern Ukraine did not conduct any offensive operations in the past 24 hours.

Ukrainian forces repelled several Russian assaults in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in the past 24 hours.

Russian forces continue to make slow but steady progress reducing the Mariupol pocket.

Russia may have failed to appoint an overall commander for its invasion of Ukraine, leading to Russian axes of advance competing for limited supplies and failing to synchronize their operations.





Russian forces are likely moving to a phase of protracted bombardment of Ukrainian cities due to the failure of Russia’s initial campaign to encircle and seize Kyiv and other major cities. Russian forces continue to conduct air and missile strikes against both civilian and military targets across unoccupied Ukraine in the absence of offensive ground operations.[1] The Ukrainian General Staff reported at 6:00 pm local time on March 22 that Russian aircraft conducted over 80 sorties in the past 24 hours.[2] Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby additionally stated on March 21 that Russian forces have increased their long-range bombardment against Ukrainian cities in an attempt to force them to surrender.[3] Russian forces are unlikely to force Ukrainian cities to surrender with bombardment alone.

Russian forces face continuing logistics and reinforcement issues. The Ukrainian General Staff specified for the first time on March 22 that Russian forces—particularly highlighting the 7thAir Assault Division operating around Kherson—are suffering casualties due to a poor medical supply system and lack of medicine.[4]The Ukrainian General Staff additionally stated that Russian forces face growing supply issues, claiming some unspecified units have stockpiles of food and ammunition for no more than three days.[5] Russian forces continue to cobble together ad hoc units of servicemen from several units to replace combat losses.[6]Russia is expanding its methods to generate replacements, including expanding forcible conscription in Donetsk Oblast and forcing Russians with large amounts of debt to sign military contracts in return for exemption from credit obligations.[7]The Ukrainian General Staff reported on March 22 that Russia is increasingly carrying out propaganda aimed at Belarusian servicemen to incentivize Belarusian participation in the war, although ISW cannot independently verify this claim and an unnamed US senior defense official stated on March 21 that the United States has seen no indication that Belarus is preparing to enter the war.[8]

Russian forces are unlikely to successfully resolve their command and control issues in the near term. A senior US defense official stated on March 21 that Russian forces are increasingly using unsecured communications due to lacking sufficient capacity on secured networks.[9] CNN additionally quoted multiple sources on March 21 that the United States has been unable to determine if Russia has appointed an overall commander for the invasion of Ukraine.[10] These sources stated that Russian units from different military districts appear to be competing for resources and are not coordinating their operations.

We do not report in detail on the deliberate Russian targeting of civilian infrastructure and attacks on unarmed civilians, which are war crimes, because those activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. We will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the Ukrainian military and population and specifically on combat in Ukrainian urban areas. We utterly condemn these Russian violations of the laws of armed conflict, Geneva Conventions, and humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports.

Russian forces are engaged in four primary efforts at this time:

Main effort—Kyiv (comprised of three subordinate supporting efforts);

Supporting effort 1—Kharkiv; Supporting effort 1a—Luhansk Oblast;

Supporting effort 2—Mariupol and Donetsk Oblast; and

Supporting effort 3—Kherson and advances northward and westward.

Main effort—Kyiv axis: Russian operations on the Kyiv axis are aimed at encircling the city from the northwest, west, and east.

Subordinate main effort along the west bank of the Dnipro

Russian forces did not conduct any offensive operations northwest of Kyiv on March 22 and continued to improve their defensive positions and logistical support.[11] Local Ukrainian sources reported Russian forces “entrenched” around Bucha on March 22.[12] Satellite imagery on March 21 additionally depicted fortified Russian artillery positions northwest of Irpin.[13] Ukrainian forces conducted several localized counterattacks on March 22, retaking the towns of Moshcun (northwest of Kyiv) and Makariv (directly west of Kyiv).[14]

Subordinate supporting effort—Chernihiv and Sumy axis

Russian forces conducted an unsuccessful attack toward Brovary late on March 21 but did not conduct any major offensive operations northeast of Kyiv on March 22.[15] The Ukrainian General Staff reported on March 22 that Russian forces deployed an additional BTG of the 90th Tank Division and other unspecified Central Military District (CMD) units to the northeastern axis of advance.[16] Russian forces did not conduct any assaults on Chernihiv or Sumy in the past 24 hours and continued to shell both cities.[17]

Supporting Effort #1—Kharkiv:

Russian forces did not conduct any offensive operations around Kharkiv and paused attacks to take the city of Izyum, southeast of Kharkiv, on March 22.[18] The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russia is deploying additional Naval Infantry from the Baltic and Northern fleets to Kharkiv and Izyum, in addition to attempting to restore the combat potential of previously deployed units.[19] The General Staff additionally reported that Russian engineering units are attempting to repair a railway connection from Valuyki (Belgorod Oblast, in Russia) to Kupyansk (Kharkiv Oblast) to support logistics efforts around Kharkiv.[20]

Supporting Effort #1a—Luhansk Oblast:

Russian forces conducted several unsuccessful attacks in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts in the last 24 hours. The Ukrainian General Staff reported at noon local time on March 22 that Russia and proxy forces concentrated their efforts on capturing Rubizhne, Severodonetsk, Popasna, and Vugledar but were unsuccessful.[21] The Ukrainian General Staff additionally stated Ukrainian forces inflicted heavy losses on a Russian attack on Marinka as of noon local time on March 22.[22]

Supporting Effort #2—Mariupol and Donetsk Oblast:

Russian forces continued to assault Mariupol and shell residential areas of the city in the past 24 hours.[23] Russian forces are continuing to reinforce artillery positions northeast of the city.[24] Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov posted an update on claimed Chechen operations in Mariupol late on March 21.[25] Kadyrov claimed the head of the Chechen branch of Rosgvardia, Adam Delimkhanov, is personally leading Chechen fighters taking the city ”quarter by quarter,” including the Azovstal factory in eastern Mariupol, which Russian forces claimed to have captured on March 10.[26] Kadyrov said Chechen fighters provide reliable cover for their ”brothers in arms” in the conventional Russian military. Social media users have independently confirmed the presence of Chechen units around Mariupol, but have not confirmed the exact role Rosgvardia units are playing in ongoing urban fighting.

Supporting Effort #3—Kherson and advances northward and westwards:

Ukrainian forces likely conducted several local counterattacks against Russian forces around Mykolayiv and north of Kherson on March 22, and Russian forces did not conduct any offensive operations.[27] The Ukrainian General Staff reported at midnight local time on March 21 that Ukrainian counterattacks around Mykolayiv pushed Russian forces out of defensive positions to unspecified “unfavorable borders.”[28]

Ukrainian forces additionally published a map on March 22 reportedly captured from Russian forces in Kherson Oblast on March 10.[29] The map reports Russia had about 10 battalion tactical groups (BTGs) from the 49th Combined Arms Army and 7th Airborne (VDV) Division operation on the Kherson axis in mid-March, in addition to supporting units from the 22nd Army Corps. Russian forces additionally reportedly had most of their command and control assets in the region stationed at the Kherson airport, which was struck by Ukrainian aircraft on March 15.

Immediate items to watch

Russian forces will likely capture Mariupol or force the city to capitulate within the coming weeks.

Russia will expand its air, missile, and artillery bombardments of Ukrainian cities.

Russian forces will likely continue efforts to reach Kryvyi Rih and isolate Zaporizhiya.

Russian forces around Kyiv will continue efforts to push forward into effective artillery range of the center of the city.

Russian troops will continue efforts to reduce Chernihiv and Sumy.

Mounting Ukrainian resistance in Russian-occupied territory would divert Russian combat power to rear area security.

March 24, 6:30 pm ET

Russian forces continue to make slow but steady progress in Mariupol, entering the city center on March 24, but conducted few offensive operations elsewhere in the country. Ukrainian counterattacks northwest of Kyiv in the past several days continue to relieve pressure on the city, and Russian forces continued to dig in. Ukrainian forces repelled limited Russian attacks northeast of the city and around Kharkiv.

Key Takeaways

Russian forces entered central Mariupol on March 24 and continued to take ground across the city. Local Ukrainian authorities left the city in order to better coordinate regional operations amid the deteriorating situation in Mariupol itself.

Ukrainian forces conducted a successful attack on Russian ships docked at the occupied port of Berdyansk, likely sinking a landing ship and damaging or sinking another. Ukraine’s demonstrated ability to inflict serious damage on Berdyansk may disrupt Russian forces from renewing attempts to reinforce operations in Mariupol and around Kherson by sea.

Ukrainian forces did not retake any territory in continuing counterattacks northwest of Kyiv but forced Russian troops onto the defensive.

Ukrainian forces repelled renewed Russian attempts to advance toward Brovary from the northeast and complete the encirclement of Chernihiv.

Russian forces continue to shell Kharkiv and struck a humanitarian aid delivery point, killing six and wounding 15.

Russian forces secured several minor advances in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in the last 24 hours.





The Ukrainian government and military directly stated for the first time on March 24 that the Kremlin believes its invasion of Ukraine has entered a second, “protracted” phase. The head of Zelensky’s office, Myhailo Podolyak, stated that Russia seeks to turn the war into a partially “protracted phase” due to high losses in personnel and equipment and the lack of significant progress in any direction. Podolyak stated the Kremlin is changing its tactics and going on the defensive to reduce Russian casualties “to an acceptable (from a propaganda point of view) level.”[1] The Ukrainian General Staff similarly stated that the Russian military leadership is ""beginning to realize that the available forces and means are not enough to maintain the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine and are conducting defensive operations.”[2] ISW previously assessed on March 19 that Ukrainian forces have defeated the initial Russian campaign of the war and that Russian forces would likely go over to the defense.[3]

The Ukrainian General Staff stated on March 24 that the Kremlin is prioritizing restoring combat capabilities in VDV (airborne) units.[4] The General Staff reported Russian commanders are increasingly deploying reserve officers, conscripts, and obsolete armored vehicles to replace losses.[5]

We do not report in detail on the deliberate Russian targeting of civilian infrastructure and attacks on unarmed civilians, which are war crimes, because those activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. We will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the Ukrainian military and population and specifically on combat in Ukrainian urban areas. We utterly condemn these Russian violations of the laws of armed conflict, Geneva Conventions, and humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports.

Russian forces are engaged in four primary efforts at this time:

Main effort—Kyiv (comprised of three subordinate supporting efforts);

Supporting effort 1—Kharkiv; Supporting effort 1a—Luhansk and Donetsk Oblasts;

Supporting effort 2—Mariupol; and

Supporting effort 3—Kherson and advances northward and westward.

Main effort—Kyiv axis: Russian operations on the Kyiv axis are aimed at encircling the city from the northwest, west, and east.

Subordinate main effort along the west bank of the Dnipro

Ukrainian forces did not conduct any new counterattacks or secure additional terrain northwest of Kyiv in the past 24 hours. The Kyiv Oblast civilian administration reported at 6:00 am local time on March 24 that fighting was ongoing along the Zhytomyr highway, in Irpin, and in Hostomel—predominantly on the southernmost advances of Russian forces attempting to envelop Kyiv from the west.[6] Social media users depicted heavy fighting and widespread Russian shelling of civilian infrastructure in Irpin on March 24.[7] Kyiv authorities additionally reported Russian forces in Bucha and Nemishevska (just northwest of ongoing fighting in Irpin) constructed new trench lines in the past 24 hours, likely to defend against future Ukrainian counterattacks.[8] Russian forces continued to shell civilian areas under Ukrainian control.[9]

Social media users geolocated footage released by Chechen forces on March 24 to a street in Borodyanka, confirming the presence of Chechen Rosgvardia units in ongoing fighting northwest of Kyiv.[10] A pro-Russian Telegram channel released footage it claimed depicted Russian Colonel General Alexander Chayko, commander of the Eastern Military District (EMD), presenting medals to Russian servicemen on the outskirts of Kyiv on March 23.[11] ISW cannot independently confirm the location of the footage, though Chayko deploying forwards to command EMD forces operating out of Belarus would track with the observed tendency of Russian general officers to command from near the front in Ukraine.

Subordinate supporting effort — Chernihiv and Sumy axis

Ukrainian forces repelled a Russian attack towards Brovary on March 24.[12] Russian forces shelled the northeastern outskirts of Kyiv throughout March 23-24.[13] The Kyiv Oblast civilian administration reported at 6:00 am local time on March 24 that Russian forces were present in Baryshivska, Velyke Dymerske, Kalytyanske, and Kalynivska rayons—all areas ISW previously assessed as Russian advances.[14]

Russian forces continued sporadic and unsuccessful attacks to encircle Chernihiv on March 24. The Chernihiv City Council reported that Chernihiv “faces destruction” from heavy Russian shelling on March 24, but Russian forces did not conduct any ground offensives against Chernihiv.[15] The Ukrainian General Staff reported at midnight local time on March 23 that Russian forces are intensifying aerial reconnaissance over Chernihiv to conduct battle damage assessments and identify Ukrainian positions.[16] Social media users depicted the aftermath of a Russian special forces raid on a Ukrainian position in Chernihiv on March 23 and Russian forces are likely conducting ongoing tactical attacks on the outskirts of the city.[17] A senior US defense official told Voice of America that Russian forces are continuing efforts to encircle Chernihiv and remain 8-10km from the city center as of March 23.[18] Local Ukrainian media confirmed the Ukrainian General Staff’s report that Russian forces conducted an unsuccessful assault on Slavutych, 30km west of Chernihiv, on March 24 as part of continuing efforts to advance towards northeastern Kyiv.[19] The Ukrainian General Staff reported Russian forces, primarily including units of the 1st Guards Tank Army, did not conduct any offensive operations against Sumy in the past 24 hours but continued to shell the city.[20]

Supporting Effort #1—Kharkiv:

Ukrainian forces repelled Russian attacks on Izyum, southeast of Kharkiv, and may have conducted localized counterattacks on March 24. The Ukrainian General Staff reported at noon local time on March 24 that Russian attacks on Izyum failed and Russian forces retreated to the “southern part of the city,” though ISW cannot independently confirm if Russian forces gave up ground.[21] The Deputy Mayor of Izyum stated on March 24 that the humanitarian situation in the city is poor due to Russian targeting of key infrastructure but that Ukrainian forces retain control of the city center.[22]

Russian forces continued to shell Kharkiv city without conducting any ground attacks in the past 24 hours.[23] Kharkiv city authorities reported Russian forces shelled a humanitarian aid delivery point at the Nova Poshta post office on March 24, killing 6 and wounding 15.[24] The Ukrainian General Staff reported at 6:00 pm local time on March 24 that Ukrainian artillery inflicted heavy losses on a BTG of the 59th Tank Regiment (of the 144th Motor Rifle Division) at an unspecified location in Kharkiv Oblast.[25]

Supporting Effort #1a—Luhansk and Donetsk Oblasts:

Russian forces secured several minor advances in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts in the last 24 hours. Local Ukrainian government officials in Luhansk Oblast stated on March 24 that “facts are fact” and Russian forces successfully advanced in Rubizhne and Popasna.[26] The Ukrainian General Staff claimed as of midnight local time on March 23 that Russian assaults on both towns had failed.[27] Local officials in Donetsk similarly reported ongoing Russian assaults in Avdiivka and Ocheretyne, northwest of Donetsk, on March 24.[28] Social media users observed Russian armor concentrated near Yasinovataya to support the assault on Adiivka as of late March 23.[29] Local Ukrainian officials reported Ukrainian forces repelled Russian attacks on Marinka, west of Donetsk, throughout March 24.[30] The Ukrainian General Staff additionally reported on March 24 that Russian forces are forcibly evacuating citizens in Rubizhne and Kreminna to Voronezh, Russia, though ISW cannot independently confirm this report.[31]

Supporting Effort #2—Mariupol:

Russian forces continued their grinding territorial advances in Mariupol, entering parts of the city center on March 24. Ukrainian forces confirmed that Russian forces seized the Church of the Intercession of the Mother of God in the center of Mariupol on March 24.[32] Social media users geolocated several other videos of fighting in Mariupol to areas close to the city center, confirming ongoing Russian advances.[33] Several videos circulated on social media confirm that Russian Naval Infantry and Chechen forces are participating in the fighting.[34]

Ukraine’s Donetsk Oblast Military Administration Head Pavlo Kyrylenko stated on March 23 that Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boycherenko relocated to an unspecified city outside Mariupol because the mayor was unable to stay in constant contact with regional authorities due to poor signal in the city.[35] Kyrylenko added that Russian forces are intentionally targeting the city’s critical infrastructure, destroying heat, water, and electricity, forcing city authorities “to leave the city to be able to work to save the people.”

The Mariupol City Administration reported on March 24 that Russian forces are using loudspeakers to falsely claim to Mariupol residents that Zaporizhia is no longer accepting refugees, the Ukrainian government has abandoned them, and that Russian forces have captured Odesa.[36] City authorities additionally reported Russian forces have forcibly deported approximately 6,000 Mariupol residents to Russia as of March 24.[37] Russian forces likely intend to demoralize Mariupol’s defenders and residents to force the city to capitulate.

Supporting Effort #3—Kherson and advances northward and westwards:

Russian forces did not conduct any offensive operations toward Mykolayiv in the past 24 hours, though Mykolayiv Oblast officials reported localized fighting continued at the border of Mykolayiv and Kherson oblasts.[38] The Ukrainian General Staff reported Russian forces continued to take measures to restore their combat capabilities and replenish supplies in order to resume offensive operations.[39] Russian forces are unlikely to be able to successfully resume their offensive toward Mykolayiv and Odesa in the near future. Local Ukrainian officials in Kryvyi Rih reported that Russian forces carried out unsuccessful attacks and have as yet been unable to move within artillery range of the city.[40]

The Ukrainian General Staff reported on March 24 that Russian Rosgvardia units are “resorting to terrorizing the local population” in Kherson to respond to protests, and ISW has previously observed Russian forces firing at protesters in Kherson.[41] The Russian Ministry of Defense released footage on March 24 of Russian engineers clearing improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in Kherson Oblast, indicating likely ongoing Ukrainian resistance efforts in the region.[42]

Ukrainian forces conducted a successful attack on Russian ships docked at the occupied port of Berdyansk on March 24, likely sinking a landing ship and damaging or sinking another.[43] Competing reports claimed Ukrainian forces used TB2 drones, Tochka ballistic missiles, or local sabotage. ISW cannot currently assess the competing claims at this time. The attack likely sank the Orsk large landing ship and damaged or sank one other landing ship. Possible damage to two other Russian landing ships docked in the port is unclear. Regardless of the specific method of attack, Ukraine’s demonstrated ability to inflict serious damage on Russian landing ships docked in Berdyansk, the largest Russian-occupied port on the Black Sea (excepting Crimea), may disrupt Russian forces from renewing attempts to reinforce operations in Mariupol and around Kherson by sea.

Immediate items to watch

Russian forces will likely capture Mariupol or force the city to capitulate within the coming weeks and have entered the city center;

Russia will expand its air, missile, and artillery bombardments of Ukrainian cities;

Ukrainian officials suggest that Ukrainian forces may launch a larger counter-attack in western Kyiv Oblast in the coming days;

The continued involvement of the Black Sea Fleet in the Battle of Mariupol reduces the likelihood of an amphibious landing near Odesa, Russian naval shelling of Odesa in recent days notwithstanding.

3,518e1123-a699-4ff1-9d7e-de8bd01a1d3f,"[""Rfe Rl'S Tajik Service""]",,"Russia's Defense Ministry warned on April 15 that it will intensify attacks on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, after accusing Ukraine of targeting Russian border towns.

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

The Ukrainians deployed devastating hit-and-run tactics against enemy tanks, while some of the Kremlin's ill-prepared forces suffered frostbite and could no longer fight, according to US officials.

With Russian casualties mounting, Vladimir Putin has his ""back against the wall"", according to Joe Biden, the US president, and could resort to using biological or chemical weapons.

A former UK and Nato commander of chemical, biological and nuclear defence forces told The Telegraph that Putin was most likely to use chlorine gas.

Ukraine's defence ministry said its forces retook Makariv, a strategically important town west of Kyiv, after a fierce battle and once more raised the Ukrainian flag there. They regained control of a crucial highway and prevented Russian troops from surrounding the capital from the north-west.

There was also ""significant fighting"" as Ukrainian forces sought to take back the city of Izyum, which the Russians seized last week, a senior US defence official said. Taking back Izyum would counter Russian efforts to block off Ukrainian troops fighting in the east of the country.

Russian forces trying to seize the southern city of Mykolaiv were also forced to reposition outside it after meeting intense Ukrainian resistance. Mykolaiv is a key position on the route of Russian troops as they move west from Crimea towards Odesa, Ukraine's major port on the Black Sea.

Ukrainian forces continued to repulse the Russian siege of Mariupol, destroying a Russian patrol boat and electronic warfare complex. Fleeing civilians described relentless bombardments and horrific scenes in the city.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/03/22/russians-retreat-ukrainian-troops-regain-key-territory/
6,518e1123-a699-4ff1-9d7e-de8bd01a1d3f,['Jeff Seldin'],,"Nearly a month after Russian forces invaded Ukraine, there are growing indications Ukrainian forces are going on the offensive, targeting Russian troops and, in some cases, retaking lost ground.

Ukraine's Defense Ministry said Tuesday that its forces had retaken Makariv, a suburb of the capital of Kyiv, following heavy fighting.

Ukraine's military also appeared to launch counteroffensives in the eastern city of Izyum, 120 kilometers southeast of Kharkiv, and in areas near the city of Kherson in the southern part of the country.

U.S. officials declined to comment on the Ukrainian efforts, but they did say that in some parts of the country, the momentum appears to be shifting.

""We have seen indications that the Ukrainians are going a bit more on the offense now,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters late Tuesday.

""They have been defending very smartly, very nimbly, very creatively in places that they believe are the right places to defend,"" he said. ""And we have seen them now in places, particularly in the south near Kherson, they have tried to regain territory.""

Other U.S. officials were even more blunt about the state of Russian military operations.

""Russia has thus far manifestly failed,"" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters about the Kremlin's plans for Ukraine.

""Whether Russia takes a city, takes a town or takes more territory, they are never going to be able to achieve the purpose they set out … which was to bring this country to heel,"" he said. ""The brave citizens of Ukraine are refusing to submit. They are fighting back.""

On its English-language Telegram feed, Russia's Ministry of Defense portrayed a vastly different war effort, praising Russian forces as they advanced on parts of southeastern Ukraine while Ukrainian forces fled, and claiming success in taking out Ukrainian fuel depots and positions with ""high-precision long-range"" weapons.

A senior U.S. defense official, briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss intelligence, confirmed Russian ships in the Sea of Azov had begun shelling the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, which has been under heavy fire for days.

But the official said other intelligence suggests Russia's invasion of Ukraine has become a logistical nightmare, with Russian forces still struggling to overcome shortages of fuel, food and precision-guided munitions.

Pentagon officials said Tuesday those shortages could be part of the reason Russia has ""at least in one instance"" used an advanced hypersonic missile to take out a Ukrainian military storage facility, a move one official described as a ""head-scratcher.""

Even basic supplies seem to be lacking.

""We picked up some indications that some of their soldiers are suffering from frostbite because they lack the appropriate cold weather gear,"" the official said. ""Troops have actually suffered and [have been] taken out of the fight.""

Civilians, too, are taking a toll as fighting rages across the country.

The United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, said Tuesday that more than 3.5 million people are believed to have fled Ukraine, seeking refuge in Poland, Romania, Moldova and Hungary.

Those who have not been able to escape are facing an increasingly dire situation.

""There is nothing left"" in Mariupol, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared in a video address Tuesday to the Italian parliament, a day after the government in Kyiv rejected a Russian ultimatum to surrender the city by dawn.

And hopes of reaching survivors with aid appear to be fading.

""The reality is that right now the humanitarian system is entirely broken down,"" Steve Gordon, the humanitarian response adviser for a Mercy Corps, said in a statement.

Cities and towns experiencing the most intense fighting ""don't have more than 3-4 days' worth of essentials, like food,"" he added.

The U.S., meanwhile, warned Russia is increasingly taking out on civilians its inability to achieve its objectives in Ukraine.

""Clearly, there are civilian casualties, and clearly, they're mounting every day because of the indiscriminate attacks that the Russians are conducting … as they become more frustrated,"" Kirby told reporters at the Pentagon.

""We believe we should call it like we see it, and we believe that there are war crimes being conducted by the Russian forces,"" he added.

Russia has repeatedly rejected accusations of war crimes, even as the United States and other Western countries raise concerns that Russia may be preparing to use chemical and biological weapons in Ukraine, or even nuclear weapons.

""If it is an existential threat for our country, then it can be used in accordance with our concept,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told CNN Tuesday when asked whether Moscow might consider unleashing some of its nuclear arsenal.

""We have a concept of domestic security, and it's public. You can read all the reasons for nuclear arms to be used,"" he added.

Russian President Vladimir Putin put his country's nuclear deterrent forces on high alert, something officials at the White House and Pentagon continue to monitor.

""We are constantly monitoring for that potential contingency, and of course we take it as seriously as one could possibly take it,"" Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, told reporters. ""We will be consulting with allies and partners on that potential contingency ... and discussing what our potential responses are.""

U.S. President Joe Biden is set to travel to Brussels on Wednesday to meet with NATO and European allies.

They are expected to announce a new round of sanctions against Russia as well as longer-term adjustments to NATO's force posture in Europe.

While in Brussels, Biden will also meet with G-7 and European Union leaders before traveling to Poland.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity to provide a battlefield update. The Russian forces are now nearly 40 miles outside of the capital.

But that has all begun to change this week, U.S. and European officials have indicated, with the still outmanned and outgunned Ukrainian forces beginning to go on the offensive to take back territory from Russian troops who have failed to take control of the skies and remain beset by logistical problems, trying to regroup.

Russian troops have been on the offensive in Ukraine for the better part of the monthlong war, making slow and grinding progress to occupy a handful of cities in the eastern and southern portions of the country.

The latest military push represents a remarkable turnaround for the Ukrainian military from the early days of war, when the capture of Kyiv by the numerically superior Russian forces seemed all but certain in the eyes of Western leaders and defense analysts.

But experts caution that Ukraine may have just a small window of opportunity to seize on this momentum. Russian troops could learn from their initial blunders and begin to camouflage tactical positions, forward lines, and command posts, as well as to fortify logistics hubs with berms and other earthworks.

“The Ukrainians, if they are going to mount any kind of large-scale offensives, are probably going to have to do it in the next few weeks before the Russians are able to fortify the ground they’ve taken,” said Mick Ryan, a recently retired two-star general in the Australian Army. “Otherwise the Russians will dig in and they’ll be very difficult to dig out.”

Other experts say the United States and its NATO allies need to step up the delivery of weapons and other military supplies to Ukraine quickly so they can retain their momentum.

“The Ukrainian military has performed way above expectations,” said William Taylor, a scholar at the U.S. Institute of Peace think tank and former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. “But in order for them to continue, it’s going to require a lot of support from NATO and from the United States. And that needs to come now.”

So far, Ukraine has been most successful on the counteroffensive instead of mounting attacks from scratch, hitting Russian troops away from the front lines and at weak points, such as blowing up the lead vehicles of a 40-mile Russian military convoy that was aimed at the capital in the early days of the war and blowing up bridges to foil ground movements.

The intelligence arm of Britain’s Ministry of Defense assessed on Wednesday night that Ukrainian forces had probably retaken the towns of Makariv and Moschun to the east of the capital and could realistically encircle Russian forces in Bucha and Irpin directly to the west, according to a statement. Irpin, where Ukrainian forces blew up a bridge to stop Russia’s advance, has seen some of the heaviest fighting of the war so far.

Ukrainian troops have also begun to have military success in the south and east, where Russia’s monthlong offensive has seen more success. British defense intelligence officials assessed on Thursday that Ukraine launched strikes at a landing ship and ammunition storage depots in Russian-occupied Berdyansk, in ongoing efforts to disrupt Russia’s military supply chain and hurt morale. Ukraine has also repeatedly repulsed Russian forces advancing on Mykolaiv, near the port city of Odesa. U.S. defense officials also believe that the town of Izyum, southeast of Kharkiv, that was overtaken by Russia last week is also being contested.

“Against the odds, they have snarled up Russia’s invading army, inflicting defeat after defeat,” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said at a NATO summit in Brussels on Thursday. “The heroism of Ukraine has changed the geopolitics of Europe.”

U.S. defense officials and diplomats tracking the conflict describe Ukraine’s military gains as a surprise success story, given how many forces Russia had amassed on the country’s borders in the months leading up to the invasion.

They point to a combination of the Ukrainian military’s savvy tactics, the arms supplies and multiyear military training missions Western countries have sent to Ukraine, and Russia’s military blunders and ineptitude.

“There’s another big factor here: Ukraine’s fighting spirit,” added one U.S. diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to speak publicly. “They’ve shown us, and more importantly [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, that they’re not just going to keel over, that they are wholly unified in the fight against Russia.”

But Russian troops have begun making tweaks to their approach, despite officials and experts pointing out the seeming lack of an overall Russian command structure for the war—as well as the deaths of numerous senior Russian military figures on the front lines.

Yet some military analysts see the Russian tweaks as less of a strategic move and more of a face-saving measure, as the Russian military’s command structure has been decimated by the losses of top generals and colonels on the battlefield.

“You can’t get food, you can’t get ammo, and you have nobody really telling you what to do,” said Mick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense and CIA paramilitary officer. “Why not just stop what you’re doing?”

Satellite imagery shared with Foreign Policy and others by the space technology company Maxar last week showed Russian forces using berms to protect and conceal armored units near Antonov Airport, located less than 20 miles from Kyiv, where Russia has sought to build an air bridge to attack the Ukrainian capital, as well as in the nearby towns of Zdvyzhivka and Berestyanka.

U.S. and European officials have also said Russia is considering plans to send in reinforcements: a motley force that could include conscripts, foreign fighters from Syria, and members of the paramilitary Wagner Group. Some Wagner Group members are already engaged in battle against Ukrainian troops in the Donbass region.

But officials and experts are not sure whether the introduction of new troops could further compound Russia’s command problems.

One Ukrainian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with the media, said that many of the Russian conscripts already sent into the fight were in their late teens and had little specialized combat training. Many of them thought they were being deployed for training exercises in western Russia and Belarus.

“As we see, their Army is bullshit,” the official said. Russia’s strategy is an effort “to try to beat us with [sheer] numbers of their troops,” the person said. “They’re trying to fight an ancient war, like in the 19th century. They don’t act like a modern army.”

Meanwhile, weapons have continued to flow to Ukraine from the West, with U.S. officials telling reporters that the first deliveries of a new $800 million weapons package announced by U.S. President Joe Biden is likely to begin landing in Europe in the coming hours.

The shipment will restock Ukraine’s supply of Javelin anti-tank missiles and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles. A senior U.S. defense official said on Wednesday that the Western anti-air systems have prevented Russian pilots from lingering in Ukrainian airspace.

The British government said on Wednesday night it would provide 6,000 new defensive missiles to Ukraine and over $30 million in new military aid commitments. Washington has also begun consulting with NATO about providing anti-ship missiles to Ukraine, a senior U.S. administration official said on Thursday, a move aimed at helping Ukrainian forces repel Russian naval and amphibious assaults from the Black Sea.

But even as Ukraine’s military strength has earned Kyiv plaudits in Western capitals, the question of further military integration with the United States and Europe remains taboo.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has recently pressed Western countries to accept Ukraine as a member of NATO and the European Union, but that is unlikely to happen in the near term.

Zelensky has also criticized NATO for not doing more to aid Ukraine’s fight against Russia, while touting the effectiveness of his country’s military.

“Never, please, never tell us again that our army does not meet NATO standards,” he said in a televised address on Thursday. “We have shown what our standards are capable of.”",https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/03/24/ukraine-russia-counterattack/

While there's a growing picture that Russia's assault on Ukraine has not gone to plan, the country continues to use its air power to obliterate cities and target civilians to push Ukraine into submission.

So where is this war going? Here are a few things to watch out for in the coming weeks.

Russia could intensify its bombing campaign

Experts are warning that the more Russia takes a hit on the ground, the more likely it is to intensify its aerial bombing campaign and the use of other ""standoff"" weapons that put Russian soldiers in less danger.

There is little reliable information coming out of either Ukraine or Russia on death tolls, but a report in a Russian tabloid on Monday suggested that the Russian side had lost nearly 10,000 soldiers and that another 16,000 had been injured.

The Komsomolskaya Pravda website removed the numbers later in the day, claiming the numbers only appeared in the first place because it had been hacked. CNN could not verify the numbers, but the death toll is closer to what US intelligence agencies have been reporting.

And in the region of southern Mykolaiv, local authorities are mulling what do with hundreds of Russian corpses.

Such losses, if proven to be true, would explain both the stall in ground movement and the uptick in aerial bombing of key cities and other standoff attacks. A senior US defense official, for example, said Russia has begun firing on the southern city of Mariupol from ships in the Sea of Azov.

""Russia still has capabilities and reserves, and there's going to be an uptick in intensity as it makes an effort to bring in more troops,"" Jeffrey Mankoff, a distinguished research fellow at the US National Defense University's Institute for National Strategic Studies, told CNN.

Russia may try to encircle Ukrainian fighters in the east

There is a lot of talk about the Russian war effort stalling, but whether or not that's true comes down to what Moscow's objectives were in the first place. And even that's hard to know for sure, as the country's public justification for its invasion is clear propaganda, as evidenced by Russian President Vladimir Putin's call for the ""denazification of Ukraine,"" for example.

It's likely that Russia is, at the very least, trying to absorb parts of eastern Ukraine. Areas like Donetsk and Luhansk, which make up the Donbas region, have been controlled by Russian-backed separatists since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea, and while Russia's ambitions may stretch beyond Donbas, it's still likely a central focus, experts say.

While there is a lot of attention on Russia's push toward Kyiv, most of the Ukrainian army remains near Donetsk and Luhansk, where they are grouped as the Joint Forces Operation. The movement of Russian troops suggest they are trying to encircle the JFO on three axes, and this is likely to be Russia's main focus. That's clear by looking at the sophistication of the kind of troops being sent there, said Sam Cranny-Evans, a research analyst with the Royal United Services Institute.

""The Southern Military District — in Donetsk, Luhansk, Mariupol, Berdyansk, Melitopol — these are the best troops in the Russian army. And they always work. They're designed to fight NATO,"" Cranny-Evans told CNN.

It comes as Ukraine says it retook the strategically significant suburb of Makariv, north of Kyiv, and repelled an attack on the coastal city of Mykolaiv, just east of Odesa on the Black Sea.

Ukraine’s military is now trying to push Russia out of Izyum, in the east of the country, while fighting a breakthrough of Russian troops in Mariupol, according to an anonymous US official who briefed reporters on the Pentagon’s latest battle assessment.

Russia, meanwhile, has made no tangible attempt to physically resupply its troops fighting in Ukraine, which has dropped ""slightly below"" 90 per cent of its original force for the first time, said the US official, quoted by Foreign Policy and USA Today.

Moscow is said to be considering adding more troops and resupplying those that remain out of the 190,000 originally assembled in Belarus and western Russia before crossing the border on 24 February.

There are also claims that some Russian troops have suffered frostbite, while there are also signs Moscow is having trouble refuelling its ships at sea.

""Clearly they did not properly plan for it,"" the senior defence official was quoted as saying.

The official added that additional troops would be drawn into Ukraine from outside of Russia, with 75 per cent of its battalion tactical group generation capacity already used in Ukraine.

The mercenary Wagner Group, meanwhile, has reportedly entered the war in the eastern Donbas region. A Ukraine counteroffensive in Izyum, south of Kharviv, would aim to stop Russian forces encircling the bulk of its army on the frontlines in the disputed Donbas.

Ukraine’s defence ministry said regaining the Kyiv suburb of Makariv allowed its forces to retake control of a key highway needed the block the encirclement of the city from the northwest.

Russian forces were able to take control of other suburbs in the northwest, including Bucha, Hostomel and Irpin, but were still almost 10 miles from the city’s centre, the defence ministry added.

The closest the Russian advance has come has reportedly been nine miles to the northwest and 19 miles to the east.

While Kyiv is Vladimir Putin’s primary objective, the bulk of his army remains engaged in battle in the south and east of the country, according to US and British officials.

In Mariupol, which has seen some of the fiercest fighting, Russia has begun shelling the city from seven ships in the Sea of Azov, with some of its troops able to enter the city on Tuesday morning.

More than 1,100 civilians who had escaped the besieged city were on their way in a convoy of buses to another city to Mariupol’s northwest, according to the city council.

Russia has also increased its air sorties over the past two days, carrying out as many as 300 in the past 24 hours, and has fired more than 1,100 missiles into Ukraine since the invasion began.
