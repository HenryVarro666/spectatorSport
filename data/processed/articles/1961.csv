A Ukrainian mayor who was abducted by Russian forces was released after a mass protest by the town's residents, reports say.

Russian forces entered the northern Ukrainian city of Slavutych, near the Chernobyl power plant, on Saturday and seized a hospital, and took the mayor Yuri Fomichov hostage, Ukrainian officials said.

Slavutych, population 25,000, was purpose-built for Chernobyl nuclear power plant workers after the 1986 disaster.

Russian forces captured the plant when it invaded Ukraine a month ago, and it continued to be staffed by Ukrainians.

Oleksandr Pavliuk, the Kyiv regional military administration head, shared videos on Telegram that he said showed residents protesting against the Russian occupation while holding a large Ukrainian flag.

He said that Russian troops opened fire in the air and threw stun grenades at the crowd, but they refused to disperse.

Mayor Yuri Fomichov was released a few hours later, and a video posted on social media by a local journalist appeared to show him speaking to the protesters.

""In captivity, I negotiated with the occupiers,"" he said in the video, according to The New York Times. ""It was agreed that if it is confirmed that our military is not in the city, everything will be calm.""

""Slavutych remains under the Ukrainian flag!"" he said.

Fomichov said that Russian forces had instructed residents to hand over any weapons and added that the national police and the Ukrainian military were no longer in the town.

""We will appoint people on duty to prevent looting, chaos, and disorder,"" he said, according to The New York Times.

The paper noted that it was not clear if Fomichov was speaking freely.

Slavutych, a northern town close to the Chernobyl nuclear site, was taken by Russian forces but stun grenades and overhead fire failed to disperse unarmed protesters on its main square on Saturday.

The crowd demanded the release of mayor Yuri Fomichev, who had been taken prisoner by the Russian troops.

Attempts by Russian troops to intimidate the growing protest failed and on Saturday afternoon Fomichev was let go by his captors.

An agreement was made that the Russians would leave the town if those with arms handed them over to the mayor with a dispensation for those with hunting rifles.

Fomichev told those protesting that the Russians had agreed to withdraw “if there are no [Ukrainian] military in the city”.

The deal struck, the mayor said, was that the Russians would make a search for Ukrainian soldiers and arms and then depart. One Russian checkpoint outside the city would remain.

The incident highlights the struggle that Russian forces have faced even where they have had military victories.

Slavutych, population 25,000, sits just outside the so-called exclusion zone around Chernobyl – which in 1986 was the site of the world’s worst nuclear disaster. The plant itself was seized by Russian forces soon after the start of the 24 February invasion.

“The Russians opened fire into the air. They threw flash-bang grenades into the crowd. But the residents did not disperse, on the contrary, more of them showed up,” said Oleksandr Pavlyuk, a governor of the Kyiv region in which Slavutych sits.

Meanwhile, Ukraine’s defence ministry claimed that Russia was “trying to intensify the activities of sabotage and reconnaissance groups in Kyiv in order to destabilise the socio-political situation, disrupt the system of public and military administration”.

Western officials have said that Vladimir Putin had planned to take Ukraine’s capitals within days of announcing his “special military operation” on 24 February but had come across unexpectedly fierce resistance.

While the occasional blast can be heard in Kyiv from fighting to the west of the city, the centre has been calm for most of the past fortnight.

“To start with they wanted blitzkrieg, 72 hours to get control [of] Kyiv and much of Ukraine, and it all fell apart,” said Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the lead negotiator in talks with Russia, in an interview in Kyiv.

“They had poor operational planning, and they realised it was advantageous for them to surround cities, cut off the main supply routes, and force people there to have a deficit of food, water and medicines,” he said, describing the siege of Mariupol as a tactic to sow psychological terror and exhaustion.

However, Podolyak expressed scepticism over a claim from the Russian defence ministry on Friday that Moscow’s forces would now focus mainly on the Donbas area in east Ukraine.

“Of course I don’t believe that. They don’t have interests in Donbas. Their main interests are Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and the south – to take Mariupol, and to close the Azov Sea … we see them regrouping and preparing more troops to send in,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/26/russian-soldiers-release-ukraine-towns-mayor-and-agree-to-leave-after-protests

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

Russian forces occupied Ukraine's northern Slavutych city, according to its mayor on Saturday.

Yuriy Fomichev said in a video message that city officials received a warning from Russian forces three days ago to surrender without a fight.

Noting they defended the city resolutely despite the warning, Fomichev said: ""But Slavutych is under occupation as of today.""

Fomichev said he is negotiating with Russian troops for the evacuation of residents.

The mayor was kidnapped earlier by Russian forces after a group of protestors refused to disperse. He was later released.

When Russian forces captured the city hospital, residents took to the streets in protest, unfurling a large Ukrainian flag and shouting slogans against Russia, said Aleksander Pavlyuk, head of the Kyiv Regional Military Administration.

Russian forces threw sonic charges to disperse the crowd and opened fire into the air, he said.

Images of demonstrations in Slavutych and Russians opening fire on civilians were also shared on social media.

The city was built especially for personnel who evacuated the 1986 Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant disaster.

The Russia-Ukraine war, which began Feb. 24, has met international outrage, with the EU, US and UK, among others, implementing tough financial sanctions on Moscow.

At least 1,081 civilians have been killed in Ukraine and 1,707 injured, according to UN estimates, while noting that the true figure is likely far higher.

According to Fomichev: ""This is Ukrainian Slavutych, under Ukrainian flags. Yesterday (26 March - ed.) Russian occupying forces entered the city. We had been defending it for two days, our guys stood firm to the last. The territories around the town have been occupied for a long time, so there was simply no way that the Armed Forces of Ukraine could join us in this battle.

We were very well-supported by artillery, but when the Russians approached the town, it was decided that the artillery should not operate there. Our artillery is not operating in our town, we are not hiding behind civilians.

Therefore, a conscious decision was made to redeploy our soldiers and our territorial defence units to the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and the town started a peaceful protest. More than 5,000 residents expressed their attitude to the occupiers: ‘This is our land, this is our territory, and we solve our problems ourselves here.’""

Details: Fomichev debunked fakes: ""We are not cooperating with the occupier in any way.""

""We have set the conditions of the town's existence during the occupation, but we do not need any humanitarian or other aid from the occupiers. We have been solving our problems on our own for some time now. We have experienced power outages. We will definitely win and break through"", the mayor said.

He described a conversation he had with the Russians on 26 March.

According to Fomichev: ""There were no compromises. When the occupiers came to the residential area, it was decided at the level of the Armed Forces to stop the resistance in the city, not to go to the city. There are no Armed Forces here: Slavutych was defended only by territorial defence units. Support from the artillery could be only from afar, and the Armed Forces simply could not shoot at their own homes, their own towns. We do not do that anywhere. And we no longer had any weapons or means to defend ourselves in the town.

That’s why we took this decision. It was not a compromise with the enemy. We saved our boys and our civilians.

We did not accept any of the occupiers’ demands. The only thing they clearly demanded was that they would search the town for weapons. The town went on a peaceful protest.

These were the only agreements: that we govern ourselves on our own land, live according to Ukrainian laws, according to the Ukrainian Constitution, and under the Ukrainian flag - they have no influence on this and should not have any. As for the weapons, that is their initiative; we cannot deter them from such actions today.""

Details: On Sunday, 27 March, Russian occupying forces entered the town, and they continue to search buildings for weapons. But there are no weapons in the town: the military took them with them, Fomichev assured his listeners.

He added that the authorities are working on ""green corridors"" to evacuate civilians and to bring in Ukrainian humanitarian aid.

""Yes, we are under occupation, but we are not accepting any items from the occupier,"" the mayor stressed.

Previously: On 24 February, the first day of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine, Russian troops occupied the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, and soon Slavutych was isolated, although there was no fighting in the city.

Slavutych, home to many Chernobyl workers, has experienced intense fighting since Russia invaded Ukraine last month, prompting concerns of nuclear fallout. The site requires the constant monitoring of nuclear waste, and Ukrainian staff members have continued to work at the site even after Russian forces seized the area in February.

Russian forces destroyed one of the new labs located at Chernobyl last week, reportedly stealing ""highly active samples"" and ""samples of radionuclides,” according to the State Agency of Ukraine on Exclusion Zone Management . The Russian military seized Chernobyl early at the outset of war, with more than 200 staff working around the clock to avoid another nuclear disaster.
