Russian forces in Ukraine seized Europe’s largest nuclear plant Friday after their shelling set part of the complex on fire, sparking fears across the continent of a nuclear disaster. Ukraine’s official nuclear inspectorate said technicians in the Zaporizhzhia facility, about 342 miles southeast of Kyiv, were still at work, and local authorities confirmed that the fire was extinguished around 6:20 a.m. local time after blazing for almost five hours.

The U.N. nuclear watchdog said the fire had not affected “essential” equipment and that Ukraine’s regulator reported no change in surrounding radiation levels. U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm tweeted that the Energy Department has also seen no elevated radiation readings.

“The plant’s reactors are protected by robust containment structures, and reactors are being safely shut down,” Granholm said.

But the blaze still sparked international alarm and underscored the perils of a war fought around nuclear sites.

Ukrainian officials immediately raised the possibility of another disaster echoing the deadly 1986 catastrophe at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in northern Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned in a video message that an explosion at the six-reactor, 5,700-megawatt Zaporizhzhia plant could spell the “end of Europe.” He accused Moscow of waging “nuclear terror” and of firing at the reactors deliberately.

Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov pushed back Friday and blamed Ukraine for the fire at the plant, calling it a plot to discredit Russia.

“The goal of the provocation staged by the Kyiv regime at the nuclear facility was to accuse Russia of creating an area of radioactive contamination,” he told journalists.

During a Thursday news briefing, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova also said the country was “taking every measure” to maintain the safety of the Zaporizhzhia plant as well as the abandoned Chernobyl plant, which fell under Russian control last week. She also accused Ukraine of “intentionally destroying” infrastructure, Russian state media reported.

The U.N. watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), had called an emergency meeting Wednesday as fighting closed in on the site near the city of Enerhodar.

IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said Friday at a news conference that a “projectile was coming from the Russian forces” and hit a building on the plant site overnight but did not compromise any of the reactors.

“All the safety systems of the six reactors at the plant were not affected at all, and there has been no release of radioactive material. Importantly, the radiation monitoring systems are fully functional as well,” he said.

However, the situation remains “extremely tense and challenging,” he added.

He also said two security personnel for the plant were injured. The office of Enerhodar’s mayor said Friday in a Telegram post that three Ukrainian service members were killed and two wounded. It said no plant workers were injured and claimed to have “neutralized one enemy tank with the entire crew.” The Washington Post could not independently verify the casualty toll.

After Russian forces seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant and surrounding area early Friday, Enerhodar Mayor Dmytro Orlov said in a video address that the plant was operational and running as usual. Ukraine’s national atomic energy company said the mayor’s address may have been made under duress.

A visibly grimacing Orlov put out an awkward video statement on Telegram calling on Ukrainians not to provoke Russian troops in the area and saying that no shots had been fired at civilians. He also suggested, improbably, that Russian troops had fired blanks.

“There were no shots fired at the civilian population; if they were fired, then these were blanks. There were no shots at residential areas. There were no victims or casualties among the unarmed population,” Orlov said, appearing to read from a piece of paper while being hesitant to look at the camera. “We call the population not to provoke the troops of the Russian armed forces.”

Ukraine’s national atomic energy company Energoatom said in a post on its official Telegram account that Orlov’s statement appeared to have been made under duress. “There is a high probability that the recent speech of the mayor of Enerhodar was recorded under the barrel of a machine gun,” the post said.

Energoatom said similar videos may appear from other officials “detained by the occupiers,” and it urged caution and vigilance.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson demanded early Friday that Russia “cease its attack” on Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station and said he would seek an emergency session of the U.N. Security Council “in the coming hours” to discuss the fire. London will also immediately raise the issue with Moscow, Johnson’s office said in a statement.

Before the Russian military takeover, a spokesman for the Zaporizhzhia plant said in an email that the site had been “under artillery fire” since 1:40 a.m. local time Friday and confirmed that fires had broken out. Only one of the plant’s six reactors was still generating power for the grid, the spokesman said. Before the Russian invasion, 15 reactors around Ukraine supplied half the country’s electricity.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Russian forces had surrounded and fired on the Zaporizhzhia site. “Russians must IMMEDIATELY cease the fire, allow firefighters, establish a security zone!” he said on Twitter.

Other Ukrainian authorities said the blaze occurred in a training building at the plant and confirmed that it had been extinguished and that there were “no victims.” A regional military leader in Ukraine, Oleksandr Starukh, said on social media that the head of the plant “assured that the nuclear safety of the facility is ensured as of now” but added that the situation “remains extremely complicated.”

Ukrainian firefighters struggled to access the nuclear plant because of Russian shelling in the area, according to a senior Ukrainian government official.

Zelensky spoke by phone about the fire with President Biden and European Union officials, a Ukrainian official said. The White House confirmed the call.

Jon B. Wolfsthal, a former adviser to Biden when he was vice president, said in an interview on Twitter that the reactor models built at the Zaporizhzhia plant were safer and better protected than the Chernobyl reactors.

“It’s not as dangerous as Chernobyl, but tank fire and nuclear reactors are never a good combination,” he said. He said key questions were whether there was any damage to the water pumps used to cool the reactors, whether the connection to the grid had been cut and whether transmission lines were intact.

“War is unpredictable and can lead in different directions. And when you have nuclear powers at play, it is even more unpredictable,” Wolfsthal said.

Gregory Jaczko, who served as the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission under President Barack Obama, said if the fire reached an area with fuel, that could lead to a “significant release” of radiation. Another pressing concern is making sure any of the radioactive spent fuel on the premises is kept cool, said Jaczko, who did not have direct knowledge of the situation.

James Acton, a physicist and co-director of the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said a worst-case scenario would be more akin to the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan, when a tsunami disabled the plant’s cooling system. “The reactors there just couldn’t cool themselves, and it caused significant radioactive emissions,” he said.

If damage to the grid occurred, the reactors would have to fall back on diesel generators, which are not designed for use over the long term.

About 1:30 a.m. local time on Friday, a live stream by the Zaporizhzhia plant, verified by The Washington Post, captured bright white flashes that illuminated the area in front of the facility.

At least eight military vehicles were seen positioned on the main street leading directly to the plant. White and ashen-gray smoke clouded the soundless feed.

Ten minutes later, at 1:40 a.m., the Enerhodar mayor posted on his Telegram channel that the plant was on fire. Video clips of the live stream posted as late as 11 p.m. showed an empty street — indicating that the vehicles had moved into the area before the flames.

Over the next hour, more vehicles arrived, some driving outside the view of the camera, toward the rest of the plant. The view then pans right to show that a white building appears to be on fire, a bright blaze obscuring the entrance.

Shortly afterward, munitions were seen being fired across the screen, and two blasts appeared to make contact — the latter striking the top of the building nearest the camera.

The attack came after a large crowd gathered Wednesday with Ukrainian flags, as well as barricades of cars, trucks, tires and sandbags, to block the road to Enerhodar from Russian troops.

“It is extremely important that the nuclear power plants are not put at risk in any way,” IAEA Director General Grossi said earlier this week. He added that “an accident involving the nuclear facilities in Ukraine could have severe consequences for public health and the environment.”

Grossi said Wednesday at a news conference that two sites where radioactive materials are present had already been hit in the fighting. The damage to those waste-disposal facilities in Kyiv and Kharkiv did not lead to the release of radioactive material, he said, though he still expressed concern.

“One of the unique features of this situation is that this is an ongoing military conflict taking place in a country with a vast nuclear program,” Grossi told reporters in Vienna.

“There is a lot of nuclear material present,” he said. “You could have a situation where you have low-level waste, a release of radioactive material. What we have to ensure is that these things don’t happen.”

“Putin’s shelling of Europe’s largest nuclear plant takes his reign of terror one step further,” the Embassy said.

The fire at the plant reportedly has been extinguished, after the pictures of flames coming from the facility raised grace concerns of a nuclear disaster.

Rafael Mario Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, reported that Ukrainian officials said that “the nuclear power plant continued to be operated by its regular staff and there had been no release of radioactive material.”

A projectile struck a training building in the vicinity of one of the plant’s reactor units, causing the fire that was later extinguished.

“However, the operator has reported that the situation remains very challenging and therefore it has not yet been possible to access the whole site to assess that all safety systems are fully functional,” the IAEA said.

“Firing shells in the area of a nuclear power plant violates the fundamental principle that the physical integrity of nuclear facilities must be maintained and kept safe at all time,” Grossi said.

PREVIOUSLY, 6:25 PM, Thursday: The President of the United States and the President of Ukraine have spoken directly tonight about “the fire at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant,” the White House says.

“President Biden joined President Zelenskyy in urging Russia to cease its military activities in the area and allow firefighters and emergency responders to access the site,” the administration said in a brief statement late Thursday. “President Biden also spoke this evening with Under Secretary for Nuclear Security of the U.S. Department of Energy and Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) to receive an update on the situation at the plant. The President will continue to be briefed regularly,” the statement added.

Livestream footage indicates that the shelling and gunfire from Russian forces on Europe’s largest nuclear plant continues.

However, MSNBC is reporting that Ukrainian officials are now saying the “fire broke out in a training building outside the plant’s perimeter” and the fireproofing material is keeping the reactors safe. A spokesperson for the plant told CNN’s Anderson Cooper via a phone interview that while there were multiple fires everything was okay right now in terms of the reactors. He added ominously that a “nuclear accident” could occur if Russia doesn’t stop firing on the structures. “Please help us,” the Zaporizhzhia NPP official ended his call with Cooper, asking, as President Zelenskyy has, for a no-fly zone.

Back in the States, the Energy Secretary offered more information, kind of:

PREVIOUSLY, 5:44 PM: “You are looking at live pictures of a fire that has broken out at a Ukrainian nuclear power plant in the town of Enerhodar after an attack by Russian troops,” said CNN’s Erin Burnett tonight in what could be one of the biggest events so far in Vladimir Putin’s invasion of the Eastern European nation so far.

“Firefighters are unable to reach the power plant, according to the Mayor,” added the anchor as the shelling and gunfire went on. You can see the unfolding situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in real time on the livestream below:

Located in south central Ukraine, the Enerhohr plant is the largest in the country and the largest in all of Europe. Containing six reactors, with one under repair before today’s fighting, the plant provides around 25% of the country’s power source. As the bombardment intensified, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister took to social media to put the stakes in deadly perspective:

Russian army is firing from all sides upon Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Fire has already broke out. If it blows up, it will be 10 times larger than Chornobyl! Russians must IMMEDIATELY cease the fire, allow firefighters, establish a security zone! — Dmytro Kuleba (@DmytroKuleba) March 4, 2022

Not longer after, the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency offered their own POV:

IAEA Director General @RafaelMGrossi speaks with #Ukraine PM Denys Shmygal and with Ukrainian nuclear regulator and operator about serious situation at #Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, appeals for halt of use of force and warns of severe danger if reactors hit. — IAEA – International Atomic Energy Agency (@iaeaorg) March 4, 2022

While CNN picked up on the breaking news out of Enerhohr at around 4:30 PM PT, Fox News Channel wasn’t that far behind. “Explosions & Gunfire Reported Outside Ukraine’s Largest Nuclear Power Plant” read one lower third on the Rupert Murdoch-owned outlet as host Jesse Watters interviewed correspondents on what was happening. Taking over at the top of the top of the hour like CNN’s Anderson Cooper, FNC’s Tucker Carlson leaped right into what he called “potentially a disaster.”

Back on CNN, described “Nuclear Policy Expert” Graham Allison compared today’s battle in Enerhohar to one of the horrors of the Cold War. “We should remember that Chernobyl in ’86 was a meltdown that spewed radioactive material all over Western Europe,’ Allison told a Kyiv located Cooper. “So it is conceivable that one could have another version of that. I hope not, I pray not.”

Though not heard on cable news, others online cautioned such Chernobyl comparisons:

The actual nuclear specialists are coming out of the woodwork to say that no, it would not be a marvel-movie-style explosion. Yes, it's bad — fuel could leak. But let's not retweet gov't pronouncements uncritically. It's a different kind of reactor than Chernobyl. pic.twitter.com/udyigaEWk8 — Ilya Lozovsky (@ichbinilya) March 4, 2022

Initially, MSNBC made no reference to the potentially disastrous state of affairs in Enerhohr. Instead, the Comcast-owned outlet stayed with Joy Reid focusing on U.S. domestic politics and divisions. It wasn’t until Chris Hayes took over at 5 PM ET that the channel even mentioned what was occurring in Enerhohar. Even then, MSNBC reverted to Beltway topics and themes fairly fast.

Just over a week ago, Putin ordered an invasion of neighboring Ukraine, a burgeoning democracy. The bunker-located ex-KGB agent issued the order under the pretext that Russian-speaking residents of Ukraine were under threat from purported “Nazi” forces there. The country he invaded with over 150,000 troops is led by a Russian speaker of Jewish heritage named Volodymyr Zelensky, whose relatives were killed in the Holocaust.

After surrounding Ukraine with 200,000 troops, Putin’s force was expected to quickly overwhelm the country and install a puppet government. Instead, more than a week later, as U.S. and its allies slapped severe economic sanctions on the increasingly isolated Russia, Putin’s troops have met stiff resistance from Ukraine’s military standing shoulder-to-shoulder with citizen volunteers. There is some expectation that, given the complications, Putin is ratcheting up the brutality of the attack.

As news broke of the battle at the Enerhohar plant, American politicians began to chime in, as expected:

Blasts lit up the night sky as the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, about 400 miles southeast of Kyiv, came under shell fire.

Ukrainian firefighters said they were prevented from accessing the site initially, before the attack was paused and they were able to douse a blaze at a training facility on the site.

The six reactors at Zaporizhzhia, which can power enough energy for four million homes, were apparently undamaged and international monitors reported no spike in radiation.

But the attack was slammed in Western capitals as utterly irresponsible.

""We survived a night that could have stopped the story, the history of Ukraine, the history of Europe,"" Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky said.

An explosion at Zaporizhzhia would have equalled ""six Chernobyls,"" he said, referring to the plant in Ukraine that was the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986.

""Russian tank commanders knew what they were firing at,"" Zelensky alleged, adding: ""The terrorist state now resorted to nuclear terror.""

After phoning Zelensky during the night, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson demanded an urgent meeting of the U.N. Security Council.

He accused Putin of ""reckless actions"" that ""could now directly threaten the safety of all of Europe"" and pressed anew for a ceasefire.

Putin, however, has been unrepentant about an offensive that has cast Russia into the economic, sporting and cultural equivalent of exile to Siberia.

He said Thursday that the invasion was going ""strictly according to schedule, according to plan"" in its aims of driving out the ""neo-Nazis"" in Kyiv led by Zelensky — who is Jewish.

The Kremlin denied its forces had shelled the plant, instead blaming the fire on Ukrainian ""saboteurs"" and calling it a ""monstrous provocation,"" according to the Reuters news service.

But Western leaders added their voices to Johnson's, strongly condemning the shelling.

Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store described the shelling as ""madness"" and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi called it ""heinous"" and said it was ""an attack on everyone's security.""

""This just demonstrates the recklessness of this war and the importance of ending it and the importance of Russia withdrawing all its troops and engaging good faith in diplomatic efforts,"" NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said

The head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog offered Friday to travel to Chernobyl to negotiate with Ukraine and Russia and ensure the security of Ukraine's nuclear sites.

""I have indicated to both the Russian Federation and Ukraine my availability ... to travel to Chernobyl as soon as possible,"" Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, told reporters.

""Both sides are considering"" the possibility, he added.

Russia last week seized the site of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, which left hundreds dead and spread radioactive contamination west across Europe.

Grossi said the trip would aim to discuss with both sides a ""framework"" to safeguard the security and functioning of Ukraine's nuclear sites.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chernobyl-fears-ukraine-nuclear-power-plant-fire-russian-shelling/

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian troops Friday seized the biggest nuclear power plant in Europe after a middle-of-the-night attack that set it on fire and briefly raised worldwide fears of a catastrophe in the most chilling turn yet in Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

Firefighters put out the blaze, and no radiation was released, U.N. and Ukrainian officials said. Russian forces pressed on with their week-old offensive on multiple fronts, though they did not appear to gain significant ground in fighting Friday. The number of refugees fleeing the country eclipsed 1.2 million.

With world condemnation mounting, the Kremlin cracked down on the flow of information at home, blocking Facebook, Twitter, the BBC and the U.S. government-funded Voice of America. And President Vladimir Putin signed a law making it a crime punishable by up to 15 years in prison to spread so-called fake news, including anything that goes against the official government line on the war.

Multiple outlets said they would pause their work inside Russia while they evaluate the situation. CNN and CBS News announced they would stop broadcasting in Russia and Bloomberg temporarily suspended the work of its journalists there.

While the vast Russian armored column threatening Kyiv remained stalled outside the capital, Putin’s military has launched hundreds of missiles and artillery attacks on cities and other sites across the country, and made significant gains on the ground in the south in an apparent bid to cut off Ukraine’s access to the sea.

In the attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in the southeastern city of Enerhodar, the chief of the U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said a Russian “projectile” hit a training center, not any of the six reactors.

The attack triggered global alarm and fear of a catastrophe that could dwarf the world’s worst nuclear disaster, at Ukraine’s Chernobyl in 1986. In an emotional nighttime speech, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he feared an explosion that would be “the end for everyone. The end for Europe. The evacuation of Europe.”

But nuclear officials from Sweden to China said no radiation spikes had been reported, as did Grossi.

Authorities said Russian troops had taken control of the overall site but plant staff continued to run it. Only one reactor was operating, at 60% of capacity, Grossi said in the aftermath of the attack.

Two people were injured in the fire, Grossi said. Ukraine’s state nuclear plant operator Enerhoatom said three Ukrainian soldiers were killed and two wounded.

In the U.S., Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the episode “underscores the recklessness with which the Russians have been perpetrating this unprovoked invasion.” At an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council, Ukraine’s U.N. ambassador, Sergiy Kyslytsya, said the fire broke out as a result of Russian shelling of the plant and accused Moscow of committing “an act of nuclear terrorism.”

Without producing evidence, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov claimed that a Ukrainian “sabotage group” had set the fire at Zaporizhzhia.

The crisis unfolded after Grossi earlier in the week expressed grave concern that the fighting could cause accidental damage to Ukraine’s 15 nuclear reactors at four plants around the country.

Atomic safety experts said a war fought amid nuclear reactors represents an unprecedented and highly dangerous situation.

“These plants are now in a situation that few people ever seriously contemplated when they were originally built,” said Edwin Lyman of the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington. “No nuclear plant has been designed to withstand a potential threat of a full-scale military attack.”

Dr. Alex Rosen of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War said the incident was probably the result of military units overestimating the precision of their weapons, given that the prevailing winds would have carried any radioactive fallout straight toward Russia.

“Russia cannot have any interest in contaminating its own territory,” he said. He said the danger comes not just from the reactors but from the risk of enemy fire hitting storage facilities that hold spent fuel rods.

In the wake of the attack, Zelenskyy appealed again to the West to enforce a no-fly zone over his country . But NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg ruled out that possibility, citing the risk of a much wider war in Europe. He said that to enforce a no-fly zone, NATO planes would have to shoot down Russian aircraft.

In a bitter and emotional speech, Zelenskyy criticized NATO’s reluctance, saying it will fully untie Russia’s hands as it escalates its air attack.

“All the people who die from this day forward will also die because of you, because of your weakness, because of your lack of unity,” he said in a nighttime address. “The alliance has given the green light to the bombing of Ukrainian cities and villages by refusing to create a no-fly zone.”

Russian forces, meanwhile, did not make significant progress Friday in their offensive to sever Ukraine’s access to the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, which would deal a severe blow to its economy and could worsen an already dire humanitarian situation. There were also no changes in the north and the east, where the Russian offensive has stalled, meeting fierce Ukrainian resistance.

A round of talks between Russia and Ukraine yielded a tentative agreement Thursday to set up safe corridors to evacuate citizens and deliver food and medicine. But the necessary details still had to be worked out.

More than 840 children have been wounded in the war, and 28 have been killed, according to Ukraine’s government. A total of 331 civilians had been confirmed killed in the invasion, but the true number is probably much higher, the U.N. human rights office said.

In Romania, one newly arrived refugee, Anton Kostyuchyk, struggled to hold back tears as he recounted leaving everything behind in Kyiv and sleeping in churches with his wife and three children during their journey out.

“I’m leaving my home, my country. I was born there, and I lived there,” he said. “And what now?”

Appearing on video in a message to antiwar protesters in several European cities, Zelenskyy continued to appeal for help.

“If we fall, you will fall,” he said. “And if we win, and I’m sure we’ll win, this will be the victory of the whole democratic world. This will be the victory of our freedom. This will be the victory of light over darkness, of freedom over slavery.”

Inside Ukraine, frequent shelling could be heard in the center of Kyiv, though more distant than in recent days, with loud thudding every 10 minutes resonating over the rooftops.

Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovich said battles involving airstrikes and artillery continued northwest of Kyiv, and the northeastern cities of Kharkiv and Okhtyrka came under heavy fire.

He said Ukrainian forces were still holding the northern city of Chernihiv and the southern city of Mykolaiv. Ukrainian artillery also defended Ukraine’s biggest port city, Odesa, from repeated attempts by Russian ships, Arestovich said.

Another strategic port, Mariupol, on the Sea of Azov, was “partially under siege,” and Ukrainian forces were pushing back efforts to surround the city, Arestovich said.

Amid the warfare, there were occasional signs of hope.

As explosions sounded on the fringes of Kyiv, Dmytro Shybalov and Anna Panasyk smiled and blushed at the civil registry office where they married Friday. They fell in love in 2015 in Donetsk amid the fighting between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian forces that was a precursor to the countrywide war.

“It’s 2022 and the situation hasn’t changed,” Shybalov said. “It’s scary to think what will happen when our children will be born.”

The occupation came after a fire erupted in a training building at the plant, Europe’s largest, amid heavy Russian shelling. It was extinguished hours later, according to the State Emergency Service of Ukraine.

The emergency service agency said in a statement that there were no victims in the blaze, according to an NBC News translation.

Ukrainian officials said the fire ignited at the power plant after Russian troops opened fire on it.

“Russian army is firing from all sides upon Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe,” the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said earlier on Twitter. “Fire has already broke out.”

Kuleba added that if the plant, which holds six of the country’s 15 reactors, explodes, it will be far worse than the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.

For live updates of the situation in Ukraine, follow here.

In a video posted on Telegram, Andriy Tuz, a facility spokesperson, demanded that Russia stop shelling the plant and said there was a “real threat of nuclear danger,” according to the Associated Press.

Speaking on local television, Tuz said that shells had set fire to one of the facility's six reactors, the AP reported. The unit is under renovation but has nuclear fuel inside and had been inaccessible to firefighters because they were being shot at, Tuz said, the AP reported.

The country's emergency services department later said there was a fire in a training building behind the plant, and the International Atomic Energy Agency said no ""essential"" equipment had been damaged.

The agency added that there was no change in radiation levels at the site.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke with President Joe Biden and European leaders about what he described in a Telegram post as the potential ""nuclear catastrophe"" that the shelling could unleash.

""If there is an explosion it is the end for all of us,"" he said. ""The end of Europe. ""

In a summary of their call released by the White House, Biden urged ""Russia to cease its military activities in the area and allow firefighters and emergency responders to access the site.""

The development came one day after Mariano Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said he was “gravely concerned” about the invasion of Ukraine.

“It is the first time a military conflict is happening amidst the facilities of a large, established nuclear power program,” he said.

“I have called for restraint from all measures or actions that could jeopardize the security of nuclear and other radioactive material, and the safe operation of any nuclear facilities in Ukraine, because any such incident could have severe consequences, aggravating human suffering and causing environmental harm.”

Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said it was “astonishing” that troops would apparently shell the facility, which has six reactors and spent fueling rods that need to remain cool.

A fire that damages the plant’s electrical distribution system could impair its cooling systems and potentially trigger a meltdown — “what we saw at Fukushima,” he said.

That process wouldn’t be sudden, Lyman added, and emergency personnel might be able to halt potential damage. If fuel melted, it could trigger chemical reactions — including explosions — and breach the facility, prompting a release of radiation into the environment.

The site features diesel generators that could provide backup power to its cooling systems.

If those were not able to be operated and the site was in a total blackout, mobile fire trucks could be used to inject water into the core — something that was tried at Fukushima, Lyman said.

Lyman said that nuclear power plants — including those in Ukraine — have addressed vulnerabilities that were exposed by the 2011 disaster on Japan’s northern coast.

While there’s “certainly a lot of radioactive material” at the plant, Lyman said, it differed in key ways from Chernobyl, which blew off its confinement and sent radiation high into the atmosphere. Graphite at the site burned for days.

The reactors at the Zaporizhzhia plant are a different design, have a stronger containment structure and don’t feature graphite. An ""accident sequence"" likely wouldn’t “be as bad” as Chernoybl, he said.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russian-troops-are-firing-europes-largest-nuclear-power-plant-ukrainia-rcna18668

KYIV, Ukraine — Russia’s brutal bombardment of Ukraine turned early Friday to Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, setting part of it on fire and leading a top government official to issue a harrowing warning of a massive catastrophe.

“If it blows up, it will be 10 times larger than Chornobyl!” Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter. “Russians must IMMEDIATELY cease the fire, allow firefighters, establish a security zone!”

One of the six reactors at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant — in southern Ukraine, 500 miles from the Chernobyl site in the northern part of the country — was in flames. Firefighters who attempted to fight the blaze were shot at, said a video on the plant’s Facebook page.

The scope of the damage was unclear. A spokesman for the plant told the Daily News that the radiation level at the plant was normal. But a government official told the AP that elevated radiation levels had been detected near the plant.

The reactor on fire is under renovation and not operating — but it still contains nuclear fuel, the AP said.

Though the Russian advance on key areas of northern Ukraine continued to lag on Thursday as Ukrainians putting up a rigid defense of the two largest cities, Kyiv and Kharkiv, Russian President Vladimir Putin kept battering his neighbor with bombs and pushed more than 100,000 troops over the border.

The Pentagon estimated that about 90% of the troops that Russia massed around Ukraine last month have now entered the country. Ukraine has benefited from a strong showing by its air defenses, but has still watched its urban civilian areas endure crushing attacks in recent days.

The center of Kharkiv, a city of more than 1 million people, has been decimated by air assaults, and Russian troops have reached the edge of the city, according to the U.S. Defense Department. A stalled miles-long convoy still menaces Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, home to almost 3 million.

In the south, Russia has squeezed the coastal city of Mariupol, surrounding it with troops and riddling it with missiles. And the Russian military seems to have seized its first large Ukrainian city, Kherson, also located off the coast of the Black Sea.

The U.S. government would not confirm on Thursday that Kherson had fallen. But the Pentagon suggested that the situation in the south was worsening, and that attacks were intensifying in several areas of Ukraine.

Putin claimed the invasion was going according to plan, despite widespread belief in the West that the assault has fallen behind schedule.

The U.S., which has delivered air defense equipment to Ukraine, said Thursday that it would also designate the country for temporary protected status for 18 months, the Department of Homeland Security said Thursday.

The designation provides sanctuary to migrants who are living in the U.S. and cannot return to their home country due to unsafe conditions. The Ukrainian government has already pegged the count of civilians dead in the conflict above 2,000.

In a statement, Alejandro Mayorkas, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said America will offer “support and protection” to Ukrainian citizens in the U.S.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, cheered the move.

“Ukrainians around the world are experiencing the fear and uncertainty caused by President Putin’s premeditated and unprovoked invasion of their country,” Schumer said in a statement, praising President Joe Biden for “taking decisive action so that Ukrainians can stay safely in America.”

More than 1 million refugees have flooded out of Ukraine, according to the U.N. The White House has asked Congress to approve $10 billion in aid for Ukraine, a nation of 42 million people.

The Biden administration also said Thursday that it was imposing travel restrictions on 19 Russian oligarchs and 47 of their family members and associates, and growing the list of Kremlin-allied elites facing American sanctions.

Biden said sanctions against Russia have “had a profound impact already.”

“Our interest is in maintaining the strongest unified economic impact campaign on Putin in all of history,” Biden said before a cabinet meeting. “And I think we’re well on the way to doing that.”

Britain also ordered new sanctions on two top oligarchs on America’s list of Russian elites, Igor Shuvalov and Alisher Usmanov, hitting them with asset freezes and travel bans. The two men are said to have a combined net worth of some $19 billion.

“For as long as Putin continues his barbaric attack on innocent Ukrainians, we will continue to exert every power we have to inflict maximum economic pain on Putin and his war machine,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a tweet.

The West has lined up in support of the beleaguered Ukrainians, and slapped escalating sanctions on Russia’s economy. But global condemnation and currency depreciation have done little to deter Putin’s bloody drive to topple Kyiv.

On Thursday, President Emmanuel Macron of France delivered a pessimistic assessment after a 90-minute phone call with the Russian president.

“He refuses to stop his attacks on Ukraine at this point,” Macron tweeted. “It is vital to maintain dialogue to avoid human tragedy. I will continue my efforts and contacts. We must avoid the worst.”

Macron took a leading role in Europe’s fruitless efforts to head off the war last month. He sat across a lengthy table from the coronavirus-fearing Putin in Moscow shortly before the invasion.

The in-person diplomatic rendezvous could not head off the conflict, but it generated chatter in France about Putin’s increasingly odd behavior.

With Russia staging the largest invasion in Europe since World War II, Biden has declared that there has been a “complete rupture” in the relationship between the U.S. and Russia.

Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said Thursday that there were no plans for any meetings or phone calls between Biden and Putin.

“Right now, they’re invading a sovereign country and continuing to escalate every day,” Psaki said of Russia. Asked about a sit-down between the presidential foes, she said: “Now is not the moment.”

A spokesman for the nuclear plant, Andriy Tuz, was quoted by The Associated Press as telling Ukrainian television that shells had set fire to one of the plant’s six reactors that was under renovation and not operating.

Ukraine’s nuclear inspectorate later said in its statement that one unit of the six units was operating, another was in “outage,” two were being cooled down, and two others had been disconnected from the grid.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine had accused the Russian military of deliberately attacking the complex and said an explosion there would have been “the end for everybody, the end of Europe.”

“Only immediate actions by Europe could stop the Russian army,” he added.

At approximately 2:50am local time, local news reported a fire at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant in Energodar, south-east Ukraine.

Ukraine’s foreign minister shared security camera footage from the power plant online. The video appears to show a brightly burning object falling to the ground from out of frame, followed by growing smoke clouds. The minister appealed to Russian forces to fight the fire, for fear of another Chernobyl-scale disaster.

At approximately 3:30am local time, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) announced that director general Rafael Mariano Grossi had spoken to Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmygal. Soon after, the agency reported no change to radiation readings taken at the site by Ukraine’s nuclear regulator.

At 3:47am, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky released a short video criticising Russia for firing on the nuclear plant. The president also said that he did not know how the fire would end. He continued: “Right now, Russian tanks are firing at the nuclear units. These tanks are equipped with thermal imagers. So they know where they are shooting.

“No state in history has ever fired on a nuclear power plant. For the first time in the history of humanity, the terrorist state [Russia] has resorted to nuclear terrors.” Ukrainian news then alleged that a paramilitary organisation had broken into the plant to use it defensively.

At approximately 4am, Ukraine’s state emergency services said that the fire had spread through the top three floors of a training building. However, Russian forces would not allow Ukrainian firefighters access to the site.

Essential equipment remains undamaged, but the IAEA has readied its Incident and Emergency Centre to respond at all times in reaction to the fire.

US President Joe Biden spoke directly to Zelenskyy about the fire later in the night. Before 4.30am Ukraine time, the US and UK Governments both issued statements expressing concern at the fire and nearby fighting. Later, the US said that the plants reactors were being shut down for safety. The UK has requested an emergency UN security council session to discuss events at the plant.

Local news reports that at approximately 5.20am, 40 firefighters have been allowed access to the site.

Comparisons with Chernobyl, and nuclear security at war

The power plant lies near the front lines of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine from the south, with fighting reported in Energodar in recent days. The 6GW Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant began operating in 1984 and now has six reactors, five of which remain offline for maintenance. It is the largest of Ukraine’s four operational nuclear power plants, and the largest nuclear site in Europe. These four plants host 15 reactors, more than half of continue to operate at full capacity.

Immediate comparisons with the Chernobyl disaster have increased concern around the incident, but at time of writing no evidence has yet suggested the compromise of nuclear material.

The meltdown and fire of the Chernobyl plant was the first recorded level 7 nuclear disaster, taking place in 1986. The site lies more than 300 miles (500km) from Zaporizhzhya, in the north of the country. The larger generation capacity of the Zaporizhzhya plant has led some to claim that a nuclear incident at the plant would be significantly more damaging than Chernobyl. However, this claim ignores the massive impact that reactor design, operational processes, and weather have on nuclear material dispersal.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has caused concern over the security of nuclear sites. A small radiation spike in the area surrounding Chernobyl accompanied its capture by Russian forces. However, Grossi has said that the army’s occupation of the site has meant workers “have limited opportunities to communicate, move, and carry out full-fledged maintenance and repair work”.

Since Russia captured the Chernobyl exclusion zone and reactor remains on 24 February, staff have not been allowed to leave. This has led to “psychological pressure and moral exhaustion”.

The destruction of one of two power lines supplying the site has also caused inconvenience. However, backup generators remain functional and the site does not require power to prevent further contamination.

Commenting on this, Grossi said: “Any accident caused as a result of the military conflict could have extremely serious consequences for people and the environment, in Ukraine and beyond.”",https://www.power-technology.com/news/industry-news/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-fire-ukraine-war-russia/

“Russian army is firing from all sides upon Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a post on Twitter. “Fire has already broke out. If it blows up, it will be 10 times larger than Chornobyl! Russians must IMMEDIATELY cease the fire, allow firefighters, establish a security zone!”

Mayor Dmytro Orlov of the nearby town of Energodar said that Russian and local Ukrainian forces have engaged in fierce fighting, resulting in casualties, according to Reuters.

“As a result of continuous enemy shelling of buildings and units of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is on fire,” Orlov said, according to Reuters. He added that the situation poses a threat to world security.

President Biden spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for an update on the fire at the plant Thursday evening local time in D.C. The White House said that “President Biden joined President Zelenskyy in urging Russia to cease its military activities in the area and allow firefighters and emergency responders to access the site.”

Ukrainian officials said that “essential” equipment and radiation levels at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remained unaffected, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in statements posted on Twitter.

Ukrainian authorities wrote a letter hours before the fire broke out to Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the IAEA, sounding the alarm that Russian tanks had broken through “the block-post” into Enerhodar.

“The battle is going on in the town of Enerhodar and on the road to the ZNPP (Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant) site,” the letter read, describing the situation as “critical,” according to the agency.

This comes after Ukrainian officials warned days earlier that Russian troops had increased their military presence near the plant and pointed a multiple rocket launcher at it. Ukraine’s ministry of internal affairs said the country’s military was headed to the region to defend the plant.

“The armed forces, national guard and civilian militia will do anything to prevent a catastrophe, we are ready to destroy the enemy. But we have to be ready for anything,” Vadim Denisenko, advisor to the minister of internal affairs, said at the time.

Russian forces previously took control of the Chernobyl nuclear site last Thursday, less than 24 hours after the invasion of Ukraine began.
