Russian President Vladimir Putin, in an early Thursday morning address in Moscow, announced that Russia would launch a military action in Ukraine. Soon thereafter, NBC News reported that explosions were heard in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital.

U.S. President Joe Biden condemned the attack. ""The world will hold Russia accountable,"" he said in a statement before he held a late-night call with Ukraine President Volodimyr Zelenskyy.

Earlier, European and U.S. officials scrambled to penalize Russia on Wednesday, responding to its deployments of troops to eastern Ukraine with a cascade of economic sanctions.

As concerns grew that Russian aggression would escalate, Ukraine warned its citizens to avoid traveling to Russia and to leave the country immediately if they are already there. The move came after Putin said Wednesday that Moscow is ""always open"" to diplomacy, days after ordering troops into eastern Ukraine and recognizing the independence of two self-declared republics in the region.

The latest on the Russia-Ukraine crisis :

TOKYO — The Ukrainian ambassador to Japan is urging China to join international efforts to stop the Russian “massacre” in his country amid Beijing’s lack of criticism of Moscow’s actions.

“We would very much welcome that China exercises its connection with Russia and talks to Putin and explains to him that it is inappropriate in the 21st century to do this massacre in Europe,” Ukrainian diplomat Sergiy Korsunsky told a news conference in Tokyo.

China has not criticized Russia over its actions against Ukraine, and has joined in verbal attacks on Washington and its allies.

“I do believe China can play a much more active role to work with Putin in a manner we expect for civilized countries to do,” he said.

Korsunsky also asked support from the United States and its allies to provide anti-missile defense equipment to fight Russian cruise missile attacks. He said Ukraine wants to join NATO and called for its support in resolving the conflict.

KYIV, Ukraine — Explosions are being heard before dawn in Kyiv as Western leaders scheduled an emergency meeting and Ukraine’s president pleads for international help.

The nature of the explosions was not immediately clear, but the blasts came amid signs that the capital and largest Ukrainian city was increasingly threatened following a day of fighting that left more than 100 Ukrainians dead.

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the government had information that “subversive groups” were encroaching on the city, and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Kyiv “could well be under siege” in what U.S. officials believe is a brazen attempt by Russian President Vladimir Putin to dismantle the government and replace it with his own regime.

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told lawmakers on a phone call that Russian mechanized forces that entered from Belarus were about 20 miles from Kyiv, according to a person familiar with the call

BEIJING — China’s Embassy in Ukraine says it is arranging evacuation flights for Chinese citizens. An embassy statement Friday says conditions in Ukraine have “deteriorated sharply” but makes no mention of the Russian invasion.

The embassy gave no details on where the evacuation flights would be leaving from. Nor did it say when the charter flights might happen, saying that scheduling will depend on the “flight safety situation.”

It says travelers should be packed and ready to react quickly once flight schedules are announced. Passengers must have a passport from China, Hong Kong or Macau or a “Taiwan compatriot card.”

The embassy earlier advised Chinese in Ukraine to stay home and to put a Chinese flag on their vehicles if they planned to travel long distances.

MANILA, Philippines — The Philippines top diplomat says he will travel to Ukraine’s border with Poland to ensure the safety of Filipinos fleeing from the eastern European country now under attack by Russian forces.

Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. did not specify in his tweet Friday where he is going. Nor did he say how many of the approximately 380 Filipinos in Ukraine are trying to flee amid the Russian invasion.

Locsin expressed gratitude to Poland for agreeing to accept fleeing Filipinos without entry visas.

The Philippines has not condemned Russia’s assault on Ukraine but has called for a peaceful resolution of the conflict. Its outgoing president, Rodrigo Duterte, has been a vocal Asian critic of U.S. security policies and has nurtured close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jingping.

TOKYO — Asian stock prices are higher early Friday after U.S. shares recovered toward the end of a wild trading day Thursday as the world slapped sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.

Benchmarks are up in Japan, South Korea, Australia, Hong Kong and Shanghai.

Japan announced additional sanctions on Russia, including freezing the assets of Russian groups, banks and individuals and suspending exports of semiconductors.

Prices for oil and other commodities have risen sharply, raising inflation fears.

Despite uncertainty about the Ukraine crisis, as well as worries about COVID-19, the turnaround on Wall Street seemed to buoy Asian trading.

BRUSSELS — European Union leaders are putting on a united front after a six-hour meeting during which they agreed on a second package of economic and financial sanctions on Russia.

The EU Council president accuses Russia of using “fake pretexts and bad excuses” for justifying its invasion of Ukraine and says sanctions will hurt the government,

The legal texts for the sanctions agreed on are expected to be finalized overnight and be submitted for approval to EU foreign affairs ministers Friday.

EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen says the package includes targeting 70% of the Russian banking market and key state-owned companies.

She says Russia’s energy sector also will be targeted “by making it impossible for Russia to upgrade its refineries.” And there will be a ban on sales of software, semiconductors and airliners to Russia.

ADELAIDE, Australia — Australia’s prime minister is accusing China of throwing Russia a lifeline by easing trade restrictions at a time the much of the world is trying to stop the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison was reacting Friday to a report in The South China Morning Post that China had announced it was fully open to Russian wheat imports.

Morrison noted that Australia, the United States, Britain, the European Union and Japan are imposing sanctions on Russia, and said China ’s easing of trade restrictions “is simply unacceptable.”

In his words: “You don’t go and throw a lifeline to Russia in the middle of a period when they’re invading another country.”

TOKYO — Japan has announced additional sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine.

Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Friday that the new measures include freezing the assets of Russian groups, banks and individuals and suspending exports of semiconductors and other sensitive goods to military-linked organizations in Russia.

Kishida says that “Japan must clearly show its position that we will never tolerate any attempt to change the status quo by force.”

Earlier in the week, Japan suspended new issuances and distribution of Russian government bonds in Japan, aiming of reduce funding for Russia’s military. It also banned trade with the two Ukrainian separatist regions.

Japan has long sought to regain control of northern islands Russia seized at the end of World War II and previously had tended to be milder toward Moscow.

UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. Security Council will vote Friday on a resolution that would condemn Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine “in the strongest terms.” It also would demand an immediate halt to Russia’s invasion and the withdrawal of all Russian troops.

A senior U.S. official says the Biden administration knows the measure will be vetoed by Russia, but believes it is very important to put the resolution to a vote to underscore Russia’s international isolation.

The official says the council vote will be followed by a resolution voted on quickly in the 193-member U.N. General Assembly where there are no vetoes.

The final draft resolution, obtained Thursday by The Associated Press, would reaffirm the council’s commitment “to the sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.”

The council is scheduled to vote at 3 p.m. EST Friday.

WASHINGTON — The White House is expressing outrage at “credible reports” from Ukrainian officials that the staff at the shuttered Chernoybl nuclear plant have been taken hostage by Russian troops.

Press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday that “we condemn it and we request their release.”

Psaki says the U.S. has no assessment on the state of the plant where radioactivity is still leaking decades after the worst nuclear disaster in history. But she says hostage taking could hamper efforts to maintain the nuclear facility and is “incredibly alarming and greatly concerning.”

Psaki spoke after Alyona Shevtsova, an adviser to the commander of Ukraine’s Ground Forces, wrote on Facebook that the staff at the Chernobyl plant had been “taken hostage” when Russian troops seized the facility.

BRUSSELS — An official at France’s presidential office says the aim of French President Emmanuel Macron’s phone call to Russian leader Vladimir Putin was to demand the immediate halt of military operations.

According to the official at the Elysee Palace, Macron called Putin from Brussels on Thursday just before the start of an urgent meeting of European Union leaders focusing on sanctions against Russia.

The official says Macron made the call after consulting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

The official says Macron reminded Putin “that Russia was facing massive sanctions.” The official spoke anonymously in accordance with the French presidency practice.

According to the Kremlin’s report on the call, Putin and Macron agreed to continue their contacts.

KYIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says 137 civilians and military personnel have been killed so far in the Russian invasion of his country.

He calls them “heroes” in a video address released early Friday in which he also says hundreds more have been wounded.

Zelenskyy says that despite Russia’s claim it is attacking only military targets, civilian sites also have been struck. In his words: “They’re killing people and turning peaceful cities into military targets. It’s foul and will never be forgiven.”

The president says all border guards on Zmiinyi island in the Odesa region were killed Thursday. Ukraine’s border guard service earlier in the day reported that the island was taken by the Russians.

KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine’s president is ordering a full military mobilization to challenge the Russian invasion.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy issued a decree Thursday evening saying the mobilization would last 90 days.

He ordered the military’s General Staff to determine the number of those liable for service and reservists as well as the order of the call-up.

Zelensky gave his Cabinet the job of allocating funds to pay for the mobilization.

BRUSSELS — European Union leaders pledged Thursday to impose tough economic and financial sanctions on Russia, but there is a lack of consensus within the West over cutting the country off the SWIFT financial payment system.

The Belgium-based cooperative is used by more than 11,000 institutions globally. It shuffles money from bank to bank, and removing Russia from it would likely also have an impact on European economies.

Ukraine has requested the move. While the head of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, said EU sanctions need to include the exclusion of Russia from the scheme, many EU leaders remain unconvinced.

Dutch Prime minister Mark Rutte, for instance, said such a decision would also hurt European economies. Rutte said it should be a last-resort measure that could be decided at a later stage.

“A number of countries are hesitant since it has serious consequences for themselves,” he said.

BUDAPEST, Hungary - Several thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the Russian embassy in Hungary’s capital on Thursday to denounce Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and demand that Hungary’s government cut its close ties with Moscow.

Waving the flags of Ukraine and the European Union, protesters chanted for peace and an end to the Russian attacks, and demanded that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban pull his country out of its business dealings with Russia.

The demonstration in Budapest was organized by a coalition of six opposition parties that have united to unseat Orban and his ruling Fidesz party in parliamentary elections April 3.

That coalition’s candidate for prime minister, independent conservative Peter Marki-Zay, criticized Orban for his close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and urged the prime minister to “take a clear stand on Hungary’s commitment to the European Union and NATO, our allies.”

BRUSSELS — Josep Borrell, the EU’s top diplomat, said he spent his day “reaching out all over the world” to organize a united front against Russia.

Borrell carried his two phones upon arrival at the urgent meeting of EU leaders held on Thursday evening in Brussels.

He said he called more than 20 countries.

“The African Union, (countries in) Latin America, in Southeast Asia, India, Japan, .... a lot,” he said.

Borrell added that the sanctions he prepared with the EU’s executive arm that were agreed by leaders in retaliation to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will start having effect once adopted by the EU Council during a meeting of foreign affairs ministers scheduled Friday.

The EU said sanctions will cover “the financial sector, the energy and transport sectors, dual-use goods as well as export control and export financing, visa policy, additional listings of Russian individuals and new listing criteria.”

PARIS — French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Thursday that sanctions that the European allies are discussing to impose on Russia are “massive and aimed at asphyxiating Russia’s economy”.

Measures that will be taken against Russia are “very massive, very strong and I believe they will be very effective,” Le Drian said in an interview with the French broadcaster TF1.

France is working with allies in NATO and at the United Nations on getting an international consensus to isolate Russia following President Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine.

WASHINGTON — The U.S. State Department has at least temporarily withdrawn its remaining diplomatic presence from Ukraine.

The department says a core group of essential personnel who had relocated from the capital of Kyiv to the western city of Lviv near the Polish border earlier this month will now work from offices in Poland rather than on Ukrainian territory.

Earlier this week, the department had instructed those diplomats to work in Lviv during daylight hours but to spend their nights in Poland.

The department says they were ordered late Wednesday not to make the commute back to Lviv to work beginning Thursday until further notice.

VIENNA — The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency says it has been informed by Ukraine that “unidentified armed forces” have taken control of the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant, adding that there had been “no casualties or destruction at the industrial site.”

IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi called for “maximum restraint” to avoid actions that could put Ukraine’s nuclear facilities at risk.

“In line with its mandate, the IAEA is closely monitoring developments in Ukraine with a special focus on the safety and security of its nuclear power plants and other nuclear-related facilities,” he said in a statement.

WASHINGTON — U.S. aviation regulators widened the area of eastern Europe and Russia where U.S. airlines and pilots are barred because of the conflict.

In a new directive Thursday, the Federal Aviation Administration prohibited U.S. airlines from flying over any part of Ukraine or Belarus and the western part of Russia.

Earlier restrictions had barred U.S. airlines from flying over the eastern part of Ukraine. The restrictions cover both passenger and cargo flights, but not military ones.

MOSCOW — A Russian military plane crashed in the country’s Voronezh region that borders with Ukraine, the Russian military said Thursday night.

The An-26 plane was carrying out a planned flight transporting military equipment and crashed because of technical failure, military officials said, adding that the plane’s entire crew died in the crash.

They didn’t specify how many crew members were on board of the plane.

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden says the sanctions against Russia for invading Ukraine will not disrupt the global oil and natural gas markets.

Biden says, “Our sanctions package is specifically designed to allow energy payments to continue.”

The president announced a series of sanctions at a White House speech Thursday. The sanctions include restrictions on exports to Russia and sanctions on Russian banks and state-controlled companies.

Biden also says that U.S. oil and gas companies should not exploit the geopolitical risks to hike their prices and raise their profits.

A key concern has been preserving Russian oil and natural gas exports, which are vital sources for Europe and other countries. Financial markets already view the Russian invasion in Ukraine as straining energy supplies with the soon to expire futures contract for Brent crude increasing more than 5% to top $100 a barrel.

UNITED NATIONS -- Ukraine’s ambassador to the United Nations has asked the president of the 193-member General Assembly to prepare for an emergency session in the coming days in light of Russia’s military aggression.

Ukraine’s U.N. Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya tweeted Thursday that the meeting should be held under the so-called “Uniting for Peace” resolution. The resolution gives the General Assembly the power to call emergency meetings to consider matters of international peace and security when the Security Council is unable to act because of the lack of unanimity among its five veto-wielding permanent members -- the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France.

The U.N. Security Council is expected to vote Friday on a resolution condemning Russia in the strongest terms possible for attacking Ukraine and demanding the immediate withdrawal of all its forces — knowing that Russia will veto the legally binding measure, according to a senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.

ROME — Addressing fellow G-7 leaders, Italian Premier Mario Draghi warned that the crisis over Ukraine “could last for a long time, we must be prepared.”

He thanked U.S. President Joe Biden for sharing intelligence in recent weeks. He also had praise Thursday evening for the European Commission for putting what he called “a good proposal of sanctions on the table.”

Italy is “completely aligned with France, Germany and the European Union” on sanctions, he said.

“We must be united, firm, decisive and we must re-affirm in every possible moment our full support to Ukraine,” Draghi said in his G-7 remarks, according to the premier’s office.

JERUSALEM — Israeli police say they arrested four people suspected of scrawling anti-Putin graffiti on the gate of the Russian embassy in Tel Aviv during a protest.

Several hundred people staged a demonstration outside the Russian Embassy in Tel Aviv on Thursday over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Another smaller protest was held outside the Russian consulate in the northern port city of Haifa.

Israel is home to a large population of immigrants former Soviet Union and their descendants who arrived in the 1990s and 2000s.

Israel maintains good relations with both Ukraine and Russia and has tried to avoid involvement in the conflict. Earlier on Thursday Israel’s foreign minister condemned Russia’s invasion.

UNITED NATIONS — Repeating a plea for Russia to halt its invasion of Ukraine, the U.N. chief said Thursday the world body was freeing up $20 million for urgent humanitarian needs in the country.

“Stop the military operation. Bring the troops back to Russia,” Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said at U.N. headquarters. He called the offensive wrong and unacceptable, but not irreversible.

“It’s not too late to save this generation from the scourge of war,” Guterres said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has said the assault is meant to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian separatists have been fighting the government for nearly eight years. The U.S., however, said ahead of time that Russia would try to justify an invasion by falsely claiming that the rebel-held areas were under attack.

The U.N. said Thursday it was relocating some of its roughly 1,500 staffers in Ukraine. However, Guterres reiterated that the U.N. will continue providing aid to people in the country, “regardless of who or where they are.”

BRUSSELS — Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said European Union leaders need to adopt sanctions that will be strong enough to impact the Russian economy and the country’s military industrial complex.

“We don’t need sanctions that bark, we need sanctions that bite,” De Croo said upon his arrival at an urgent meeting of EU leaders in Brussels to discuss a new package of measures targeting Russia.

De Croo said the main goal of the sanctions should be to make it hard for Russian financial institutions to access international markets.

Asked whether Russia should be expelled from the Swift payment system financial system that moves money from bank to bank around the world, De Croo said he is open for discussions on that topic.

OTTAWA, Ontario — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he spoke with President Zelenskyy and says Canada is imposing more severe sanctions.

The sanctions will target 58 people and entities connected to Russia, including members of that country’s elite and their families, the paramilitary organization known as the Wagner Group and major Russian banks.

The measures, announced Thursday after Trudeau attended a virtual G-7 meeting, will also affect members of the Russian Security Council, including key cabinet ministers.

Canada is also cancelling existing export permits for Russia and will not issue new ones.

Trudeau also says the federal government will be prioritizing immigration applications for Ukrainians who want to come to Canada and is launching a dedicated telephone line for anyone who has any urgent questions about immigrating from Ukraine.

KYIV, Ukraine — An adviser to Ukrainian president says that Ukraine has lost control over the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant after a fierce battle.

Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said the condition of the plant’s facilities, a confinement shelter and storage of nuclear waste is unknown.

A nuclear reactor in then-Soviet Ukraine exploded in April 1986, spewing radioactive waste across Europe in the world’s worst nuclear disaster. The exploded reactor has been covered by a protective shelter to prevent radiation leak and the entire plant has been decommissioned.

Podolyak said that after “absolutely senseless attack of the Russians in this direction, it is impossible to say that the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is safe.”

He charged that Russia may mount provocations there and described the situation as “one of the most serious threats to Europe today.”

NEW DELHI, India — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi phoned Russian President Vladimir Putin late Thursday night and appealed for an “immediate cessation of violence,” his office said in a statement.

Modi called for efforts to return to diplomatic discussions, saying the “differences between Russia and the NATO group can only be resolved through honest and sincere dialogue.”

Modi also expressed concern over Indian citizens in Ukraine - officials earlier in the day said some 4,000 out of the 20,000 Indian nationals had been evacuated with efforts on to bring the rest back home.

The conversation between the two leaders comes hours after the Ukraine envoy in New Delhi urged Modi to contact Putin, saying the country “has a special relationship with Russia and New Delhi can play a more active role in controlling the situation.”

WARSAW — Some of the first refugees from Ukraine have arrived in European Union member Poland by road and rail.

A scheduled train from Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine arrived Thursday afternoon in the Polish town of Przemysl, near Ukraine’s western border, carrying a few hundred passengers.

The passengers of various ages, arriving with bags and backpacks, told The Associated Press they were fleeing war. Some live in Poland and were returning urgently from visits to their homeland.

The chief of Poland’s border guards, Gen. Tomasz Praga, said there was a visible increase in the number of people wanting to cross into Poland.

Officials said Poland has prepared at least eight centers with food, medical care and places to rest.

Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that “innocent people are being killed” in Ukraine and appealed to the Poles to extend every possible assistance to the Ukrainians who have found themselves in need of help.

NAIROBI, Kenya — The African Union chair is urging an immediate cease-fire in Ukraine “to preserve the world from the consequences of planetary conflict.”

The statement by Senegal President Macky Sall and AU Commission chair Moussa Faki Mahamat also calls on Russia to respect Ukraine’s territorial integrity and international law, expressing “extreme concern at the very serious and dangerous situation.”

Few among Africa’s 54 countries have publicly reacted to the invasion.

PRISTINA, Kosovo - Kosovo leaders on Thursday rejected Russian President Vladimir Putin’s claim of similarities with Ukraine’s eastern rebel provinces.

Kosovo’s president, prime minister and other senior ministers issued a joint statement denouncing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

“The massive and unprovoked attack against Ukraine’s cities and villages is one of the most dangerous hits made to the architecture of the international security built after World War II,” said the statement.

Kosovo declared independence in 2008 after a bloody conflict with Serbia years earlier left more than 10,000 people dead and triggered a NATO intervention. Pristina’s government is recognized by the United States and most EU nations, but Belgrade has refused to recognize its independence and relies on support from Russia and China in its bid to retain claims on the territory.

“Dictator Putin’s effort to refer to the Kosovo case and draw parallel are totally unstable, abusive and an attempt to camouflage the lack of any base or reason for the barbarous attack of its forces against a sovereign state,” said the statement.

LONDON — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would aim to cut Russia off from the U.K.’s financial markets as he announced a new set of sanctions in response to President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.

The sanctions include freezing the assets of all major Russian banks, including VTB Bank, the nation’s second-biggest bank, Johnson said Thursday. Britain also plans to bar Russian companies and the Russian government from raising money on U.K. markets.

Britain will also ban the export of a wide range of high-tech products, including semiconductors, to Russia and bar the nation’s flagship airline, Aeroflot, from landing at U.K. airports.

The slate of sanctions comes days after Johnson was criticized for acting too cautiously in response to Russian aggression earlier this week.

Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.K., Vadym Prystaiko, earlier called on world leaders to ban trade in Russian oil and gas and block foreign investment in the country.

MOSCOW — The Russian Defense Ministry has formally confirmed that its forces have moved into Ukraine from Crimea.

Until Thursday’s statement Russia had said only that it unleashed a barrage of air and missile strikes on Ukrainian air bases, air defense batteries and other military facilities.

The ministry said it has destroyed a total of 83 Ukrainian military facilities. Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov confirmed that Russian ground troops advanced toward the city of Kherson northwest of the Crimea peninsula.

Kherson sits on water reservoir used in the past to provide the bulk of fresh water for Crimea until Ukraine cut it with a dam in 2017 in response to Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. Konashenkov said Thursday’s move allows the resumption of the water supply to Crimea.

BERLIN — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has made a televised address to the nation condemning the Russian attack on Ukraine sharply and vowed that Russian President Vladimir Putin “will not win.”

Scholz said Thursday evening that “we will not accept this violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty by Russia” and vowed to imply severe sanction together with Germany’s allies.

Regarding the military attack on Ukraine, Scholz stressed that Putin “is on his own. It was not the Russian people who decided to go to war. He alone bears full responsibility for it. This war is Putin’s war.”

The chancellor said that “Putin should not underestimate NATO’s determination to defend all its members. That applies explicitly to our NATO partners in the Baltic States, in Poland and in Romania, in Bulgaria and in Slovakia. Without ifs and buts. Germany and its allies know how to protect themselves.”

UNITED NATIONS -- A senior U.S. official says the U.N. Security Council is expected to vote Friday on a resolution condemning Russia in the strongest terms possible for attacking Ukraine and demanding the immediate withdrawal of all its forces — knowing that Russia will veto the legally binding measure.

The United States believes it is very important to put the resolution to a vote to underscore Russia’s international isolation, and emphasizes that the veto will be followed quickly by a resolution in the 193-member U.N. General Assembly where there are no vetoes, the official said Thursday. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.

“This is a first step in how the U.N. responds to this premeditated war of choice that Russia has chosen to take, and we will see action in the General Assembly in the coming days,” he said, adding that it is part of a much broader, coordinated response that includes steps the Biden administration and its allies are taking.

The resolution is drafted under Article 7 of the U.N. Charter, which can be enforced militarily, according to the official.

MOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin says he was “forced” to order a military action in Ukraine because of the Western refusal to heed Russian security demands.

Speaking at a Kremlin meeting with businesspeople Thursday, Putin said the military action was a “forced measure” that stemmed from rising security risks for Russia.

He said that he was surprised by the West’s “intransigence” regarding Moscow’s security demands. “I was surprised that didn’t move a millimeter on any issue,” he said. “They have left us no chance to act differently.”

Turning to Western sanctions, he said “Russia remains part of the global economy and isn’t going to hurt the system that it is part of as long as it remains there.”

“Our partners should realize that and not set a goal to push us out of the system,” he said in an apparent warning to the West.

KYIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensnkyy has urged Moscow to end hostilities, adding that Russian airborne troops have been checked outside Kyiv.

“It wasn’t Ukraine that chose the path of war, but Ukraine is offering to go back to the path of peace,” he said Thursday.

He said a Russian airborne force in Hostomel airport outside Kyiv, which has a big runway, has been stopped and is being destroyed.

The Ukrainian leader said many Russian warplanes and armored vehicles were destroyed but didn’t give numbers. He also said an unspecified number of Russian troops was captured.

He said a difficult situation is developing in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city just over 20 kilometers from the Russian border. In the north the Russians are slowly advancing toward Chernihiv, Zelenskyy said.

He appealed to global leaders, saying that “if you don’t help us now, if you fail to offer strong assistance to Ukraine, tomorrow the war will knock on your door.”

BERLIN — Group of Seven leaders have strongly condemned Russia’s attack on Ukraine.

The German government, which currently heads the G7, put out a joint statement after a virtual leaders’ meeting Thursday, vowing to bring “forward severe and coordinated economic and financial sanctions.”

It called “on all partners and members of the international community to condemn this attack in the strongest possible terms, to stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine, and raise their voice against this blatant violation of the fundamental principles of international peace and security.”

HELSINKI — Baltic NATO members Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have received the first batches of U.S. military troops and equipment promised this week by U.S. President Joe Biden in the wake of the Ukraine crisis.

An undisclosed number of U.S. F-35 fighters landed Thursday afternoon at NATO’s air base in Amari, near Estonia’s capital Tallinn, Estonian media reported. F-35 fighters were reported to have arrived also at NATO’s air base in Lithuania.

On Wednesday evening, the first 40 American soldiers from the 173rd Airborne Brigade arrived in Latvia, Latvian media reported.

A senior U.S. defense official says Thursday’s attack by Russia appears to be the first phase in what will likely be a multiple phased, large-scale invasion.

The official said it began around 9:30 p.m. U.S. eastern time, with land- and sea-based missile launches. The official said that roughly more than 100 missiles, primarily short-range ballistic missiles, but also medium-range ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, surface-to-air missiles and sea-launched missiles, were launched in the first few hours of the attack.

The official said the Russians are moving on three axes: From Crimea to Kherson, from Belarus toward Kyiv, and from the northeast to Kharkiv.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it’s not clear how many Russian troops are in Ukraine now, and the main targets of the air assault have been barracks, ammunition warehouses, and 10 airfields. The official said Russian ground forces began to move in to Ukraine from Belarus around 5 a.m. Eastern time.

LONDON — Hundreds of protesters have gathered in London to urge Britain and other democracies to step up action against Russia.

Ukrainians living in the U.K. and activists gathered outside Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Downing Street office Thursday, singing the Ukrainian national anthem.

Natalia Ravlyuk, who helped organize the protest, said they wanted the “toughest sanctions and total isolation of Russia now.”

“We ... feel betrayed by democratic states because we have been talking about this war for eight years,” she said. “They just need to wake up and stop Putin now.”

Earlier dozens of protesters also gathered outside the Russian embassy in London.

UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations migration agency says it’s ready to respond to emerging humanitarian needs in Ukraine.

Antonio Vitorino, director general of the Geneva-based International Organization for Migration, said: “IOM ... is committed to staying and delivering vital assistance to the people of Ukraine.”

“Eight years of conflict in Ukraine have displaced over 1.4 million people who now rely on assistance to meet their daily needs,” he said in a statement. “This escalation will only deepen the humanitarian needs and compound the suffering of millions of families.”

Kenyan Ambassador to the United Nations Martin Kimani delivered a powerful critique of Russian escalation in Ukraine in an address to the U.N. Security Council on Monday night that has gone viral.

Drawing parallels between the Ukrainian situation and Africa’s own experience with borders drawn by outside powers in the aftermath of empire collapse, Kimani emphasized that despite understandable desires “for integration with peoples in neighboring states,” integration by force and expansionism are unacceptable. He called on all U.N. member states to rally in support of multilateralism to find a peaceful resolution to the Russia-Ukraine crisis.

Ghana and Gabon, the other two non-permanent African members of the Security Council, echoed Kenya in emphasizing their support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and expressing concerns over the global ramifications of Russian escalation of the conflict.

Yet a South African government statement, blaming neither Russia nor Ukraine, called for “inclusive talks led by the UNSC” and “enhanced diplomacy.” Nigerian press accounts have underscored the plight of Nigerian and other foreign students in Ukraine. Reportedly, Morocco, Nigeria and Egypt are in the top 10 list for countries whose students are studying in Ukraine, accounting for 8,000, 4,000 and 3,500 students respectively.

Key future ramifications of the invasion include increasing uncertainty in diplomatic and economic relations between African countries and Russia, in a context of increasing Russian influence and engagement on the continent over recent years and a potential dampening impact on the BRICS Summit to be hosted by China later this year, and South Africa’s engagement in it.

Arctic

Marisol Maddox, Senior Arctic Analyst, Mike Sfraga, Chair and Distinguished Scholar, Evan Bloom, Senior Fellow

President Joe Biden's statement on February 24th that there is a “complete rupture right now in U.S.-Russian relations” has stark implications for the Arctic. Long portrayed as a region of peace, cooperation, and engagement, the Arctic is now inextricably linked to the unfolding and further invasion of Ukraine by Russia. All bilateral and multilateral efforts within the Arctic region involving Russia, from the Arctic Council to the Arctic Coast Guard Forum to regional scientific and maritime transportation agreements may be in jeopardy. This is especially evident in the context of the on-going Russian chairmanship of the Arctic Council, which will continue into next year. Arctic nations navigated the headwinds of the Russian Federation’s initial invasion of Ukraine and subsequent annexation of Crimea and ensured, for the most part, but after some delay, that Arctic engagement and cooperation was maintained – and in some areas enhanced. The largescale invasion of Ukraine is such a serious step for all States active in the Arctic that normal modes of cooperation, including those focused on climate change, will likely be reassessed.

Security Implications

The Arctic is a strategic landscape for Russia; the Kola Peninsula is home to Russia’s Northern Fleet, and an important hub for their strategic submarine and second-strike capability. Moreover, Russia uses the Arctic to test and demonstrate its military capabilities, such as in the recent nuclear strategic forces exercise GROM 2022, when the nuclear triad was tested alongside hypersonic and ballistic missiles. If, as some fear, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine spills into other areas, due to a miscalculation, misstep, miscommunication, or purposeful action— to include NATO member or partner states— Russia’s Arctic-based military assets will undoubtedly be drawn into the conflict. The Arctic has strong NATO representation, including the United States, Norway, Denmark, Canada, and Iceland, as well as partner countries Finland and Sweden. The latter two nations have navigated a difficult balance between deterrence and reassurance to maintain practical relations, though Russia’s actions in Ukraine may bring about a re-evaluation of such policies. Two previously planned defensive NATO exercises will commence in the Arctic this week, coinciding with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, asserting alliance unity as a deterrence against further aggression at a critical moment in history. BRILLIANT JUMP 2022 is scheduled to begin in Norway on February 28th and the Norwegian-led bi-annual COLD RESPONSE 2022, which includes NATO partner nations Finland and Sweden, is scheduled to begin on March 14th.

Diplomatic Implications

“Arctic exceptionalism,” and the qualities that have enabled cooperation to endure in the region despite external tensions, is at risk more today than at any other time in recent history. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is in direct conflict with the spirit of the Arctic Council (the premier intergovernmental forum for regional cooperation) as outlined in the Ottawa Declaration, and the foundation upon which the Council’s work has been developed and effectuated. Arctic diplomats have a significant challenge before them as they seek to navigate political realities and constraints in their objectives to continue progress in areas of meaningful mutual interest, such as action on climate change, while recognizing and addressing Russia’s norm-breaking invasion of a sovereign nation.

Economic Implications

Ever-evolving sanctions will impact economic development in the region – the full effects are yet to be seen - and could potentially expand to include Russian energy projects. This will likely push Russia closer to China as it seeks non-Western sources of financing for critical Arctic development projects. Chinese reception to such Russian overtures should be analyzed carefully as the Chinese government has its own regional and global interests to consider. Sanctions may also create a surge in illicit trade opportunities for transnational criminal organizations, as Russia seeks alternative means of acquiring certain goods, technologies, or services the country may no longer have access to.

Canada

Christopher Sands, Director, Canada Institute

Canadian PM Justin Trudeau made the following statement last night:

“Canada condemns in the strongest possible terms Russia’s egregious attack on Ukraine. These unprovoked actions are a clear further violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. They are also in violation of Russia’s obligations under international law and the Charter of the United Nations.

“Canada calls on Russia to immediately cease all hostile and provocative actions against Ukraine and withdraw all military and proxy forces from the country. Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected, and the Ukrainian people must be free to determine their own future.

“Russia’s actions will be met with severe consequences. Tomorrow morning, I will be meeting with G7 partners, and we will continue working closely and quickly with NATO and our allies to collectively respond to these reckless and dangerous acts, including by imposing significant sanctions in addition to those already announced.

“In the face of these attacks on Ukraine, Canada will take additional action to stop Russia’s unwarranted aggression. We continue to stand with Ukraine, its people, and the Ukrainian Canadian community here in Canada. Russia’s brazen acts will not go unpunished.”

China

Robert Daly, Director of the Kissinger Institute on China and the U.S.

The first thing to notice about China’s official response to the invasion of Ukraine is that Xi Jinping himself has said nothing. The leaders of most other Western and northeast Asia countries have made personal statements condemning Russia’s actions, but Xi has let his Foreign Ministry do the talking.

This is because silence preserves the illusion of wisdom and keeps options open, but also because Xi has already made his position clear. On February 4, on the eve of the Olympics, Xi and Vladimir Putin announced an “unlimited” quasi alliance that would “oppose further enlargement of NATO” and “remain highly vigilant about the negative impact of the United States' Indo-Pacific strategy.” China is not yet guilty by association in Ukraine but, after February 4, it cannot deny all association with Putin’s invasion, which it neither desired nor foresaw. That linkage, and that error, will call Xi’s judgment into question as he heads into the annual Two Sessions meetings soon to convene in Beijing.

China’s Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, is trying to convince Chinese audiences that the war is the fault of the United States and NATO. Spokesperson Hua Chunying states that NATO owes China a “debt of blood” for the bombing of its embassy to Yugoslavia in 1999—a phrase intended to reignite the ire of the Chinese people against the West—and insists that “a key question here is what role the U.S., the culprit of current tensions surrounding Ukraine, has played.”

It is striking that China views an invasion that clearly violates its sacred diplomatic principles through the lens of Sino-U.S. competition, principles be damned. Striking too that, despite Xi’s quest for global leadership, China has not yet attempted to broker peace between two nations with which it has good relations. Expect China to continue its accusations against the West, its equivocation regarding Russia, and its aversion to the risky pursuit of peace.

France and Europe/EU

Jim Hollifield, Global Fellow

France currently holds the six-month, rotating presidency of the Council of the EU, and France President Emmanuel Macron tried to use all his skills of persuasion to defuse the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, with multiple meetings and telephone calls with President Vladimir Putin—all to no avail.

The principal lesson to be drawn from this is that President Putin pays little heed to European leaders or the EU, preferring to deal directly with the U.S., while shoring up his flank with China. President Macron has the ambition to create a common European foreign and security policy, but this now looks more difficult than ever. France and Europe find themselves once again caught between two nuclear-armed super powers, as Europe slides back into a new cold war.

That said, President Putin and the Russians have succeeded in uniting the Europeans in ways that one could only have imagined a few weeks ago—witness how quickly the Germans suspended Nordstream2, something they were reluctant to do for many years. The Russian invasion of Ukraine demonstrates the vital role of NATO in European security, and the dream of a common European defense policy is as far away as ever.

Assuming that President Putin and the Russians succeed in subjugating Ukraine—although a protracted war with many casualties and guerilla resistance in Ukraine is a distinct possibility—the conflict will play out on an economic stage.

The Russians hold a trump card in that they can cut off energy (gas and oil) supplies to Europe, leading to major economic disruptions and another inflationary spike in energy prices. In the longer term, economic sanctions against the Russian government, banks, and other corporations will do major damage to the Russian economy, but this is a price that President Putin and his regime are willing to pay. It will be interesting to see if the Russian people will follow him down this path with great loss of blood and treasure.

The immediate fallout from the invasion of Ukraine will be a humanitarian crisis and a flood of refugees heading east. I hope the EU is preparing for this eventuality.

As President Putin said today, he hopes everyone now is paying attention to him and to Russian demands. He certainly got the attention of the EU, including the U.K. The front-line states of NATO, the Baltics in particular, will be watching developments in Ukraine nervously, looking over their shoulders to the U.S. and NATO for reassurance.

One quick anecdote comes to mind. A few years ago, circa 2018, I was giving a lecture at the Hoover Institution at Stanford and I was hosted by the 98-year-old, former Secretary of State George P. Shultz. I asked Secretary Shultz what he thought of the U.S. ‘pivot to Asia,’ to which he replied sarcastically—great move. “We pivoted to Asia and the Russians invaded Ukraine.”

The moral is that, as a global power, the U.S. does not have the luxury to focus all of our attention and resources on one region/country (China), and that our security and economic interests in Europe remain paramount.

Japan

Shihoko Goto, Acting Director, Asia Program

Japan imposed sanctions against Russia Wednesday, by prohibiting the issuance of Russian bonds in Japan, freezing assets of certain Russian nations, and restricting travel to Japan.

Prime Minister Fumio Kishida stated that ""Russia's actions very clearly damage Ukraine's sovereignty and go against international law. We once again criticize these moves and strongly urge Russia to return to diplomatic discussions…should the situation worsen, we'll move quickly to take further action.”

This will hamper Tokyo’s efforts to negotiate the return of the Kuril Islands that have been held by Russia since 1945. Japan and Russia have yet to sign a formal peace treaty after World War II.

Japan imports about 10 percent of its LNG and 12 percent of thermal coal from Russia.

Mexico

Andrew Rudman, Director, Mexico Institute

Mexican President Lopez Obrador (AMLO), during his morning press conference, called for peace, noting that Mexico does not want war anywhere, does not want people to suffer, and doesn’t want civilians harmed. Mexico’s position is in opposition to armed confrontation. He then shifted gears to add that if the price of imported gas rises, we will shift to using non-gas fired electric plants to provide needed electricity.

Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard tweeted that he was in contact with the current president of the UNSC (Mexico is a non-permanent member at present) and with the Mexican ambassador to Kyiv. He added that Mexico rejects the use of force and reiterated its call for a political solution to the conflict in Ukraine. He reiterated that Mexico supports the UN Secretary General. Mexico will work with other countries to find a space for dialogue.

AMLO’s comments reflect classic Mexican non-interventionist policies and are certainly not a ringing condemnation of Russia’s actions. This reflects his general lack of interest in foreign affairs, (note his immediate shift to how this might impact Mexico), and his long-standing aversion to foreign intervention of any sort (except when he wants to criticize, for example, the US trade embargo on Cuba).

In late January, AMLO linked the Russia-US dispute over Ukraine to neo-liberalism, implying somehow that neoliberalism was the cause. Other officials, such as the Foreign Minister and Mexico’s UN ambassador have hewed more closely to the international consensus in opposition to Russian actions. AMLO dominates the Mexican news cycle and does not respond well to criticism from outside his government or dissent from within. As a result, and despite its current UNSC seat, Mexico is not likely to play a particularly active or influential role on this issue.

Middle East

James F. Jeffrey, Chair, Middle East Program

The enormity of the Russian attack, not just on Ukraine but on the long-term global security order, is increasingly clear among states in the Middle East region, and puts pressure on the ‘hedging’ between the U.S. on one hand and Russia and China on the other, commonplace in recent years. Some hedging can still be seen in reluctance to call out Moscow by some capitals, but the dangers to the region of an entire world in limbo are immense. Thus if the U.S. maintains its so-far smart policies to make Russia pay economically and diplomatically for its aggression, regional states will eventually rally behind Washington. Turkey is most affected by this Russian move and thus its reaction is clear and strong. Iran has clearly sided with Russia, which will have repercussions in the U.S. and particularly Europe.

Russia’s FSU Neighbors

F. Joesph Dresen, Senior Program Associate, Kennan Institute

The condemnation of Russia’s actions have been swift and decisive from several, but far from all, of Russia’s neighbors who were once part of the Soviet Union.

The Foreign Ministers of the three Baltic nations of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia issued a joint statement condemning Russia’s attack on Ukraine.

Individually, the president of Latvia and Lithuania, and the Prime Minister of Estonia, each issued their own condemnations of the attack, employing the hashtag #StandWithUkraine.

The presidents of Georgia and Moldova likewise condemned the Russian attack, and the president of Moldova committed to accepting refugees from Ukraine. Over 4,000 crossings have occurred already.

There has been no official statement yet from the governments of Armenia, Azerbaijan, or Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, or Turkmenistan).

Belarus is actively supporting the Russian invasion.

South Korea

Sue Mi Terry, Director, Hyundai Motor-Korea Foundation Center for Korean History and Public Policy

South Korean President Moon Jae-in said that South Korea would join international sanctions against Russia and expressed regrets over Russia’s attack on Ukraine, noting that “the use of armed forces causing human casualties cannot be justified under any circumstances.” South Korea, however, said it is not considering adopting unilateral measures. From Seoul’s perspective, the Ukraine crisis has created troubling new realities for its economic and strategic security.

South Korea is cognizant of how North Korean leaders will view the Ukraine crisis. To the North, the lessons of Saddam Hussein or Iraq or Muammar al-Qaddafi of Libya couldn’t be clearer: Leaders who give up nuclear weapons programs are at serious risk of being overthrown and killed. That lesson is only reinforced by the current crisis between Ukraine and Russia. Watching the attack on Ukraine, Kim Jong Un can only calculate that if Ukraine still had its nuclear weapons, Russia would not dare to attack it, which will make him all the more determined to hold onto, and even expand, his arsenal of nuclear weapons and missiles.

In the short-term, it is quite possible, even probable, that the North will take advantage of the U.S. being distracted in Ukraine to launch provocations or aggressions on their own. The North could even be further emboldened to conduct an ICBM or nuclear test, knowing that Russia is less willing to cooperate with further action against North Korea at the UN. South Korea also will be concerned that, with Russia-Ukraine conflict taking all the bandwidth in Washington, the Biden administration will not be able to prioritize the North Korean challenge in the coming months.

South Korea has other causes for concern, including the impact on the global economy of the sanctions that will now be imposed on Russia. Supply chain disruptions and price spikes in international markets will be passed onto South Korea. Russia is South Korea’s 12th largest trading partner; South Korean exports containing advanced U.S.-developed technological components could be banned for sale in Russia. South Korea will also face rising energy and food prices due to the possibility that flows of Russian oil and natural gas may be interrupted or curtailed.

If the U.S. cuts Russia from the SWIFT financial network, this could also devastate Russia-South Korea trade, especially Russian energy sales. It could also undermine the South Korean automotive industry’s presence in Russia and jeopardize South Korea’s ambitions to sign a free trade agreement with the Eurasian Economic Union. South Korea has roughly 13 companies active in Ukraine and 40 companies in Russia.

Beyond the short-term economic impact, South Korea will be concerned about the long-term implications for its security. South Korea understands that it is a treaty ally of the United States and Ukraine is not, but it will nevertheless be watching carefully how the U.S. and NATO respond to the Russian aggression. South Korea will be reassured if they see the West mobilizing a massive response to send a signal that aggression does not pay. If, however, Putin wins a swift victory and the West does not manage to impose heavy costs on Russia, that will be of great concern to South Korea, and debate about the credibility of the United States as a security guarantor will increase.

If U.S. power is revealed as hollow and the international rule of law erodes, South Korea will be tempted to build its own nuclear arsenal. It might even lean more toward Beijing in the complicated calibration it tries to achieve between China (its largest trade partner) and the United States (its primary security partner). But any realignment is unlikely in the short term, with Korean public opinion turning more anti-China and particularly if a conservative candidate who is critical of China wins the presidential election on March 9th. Nevertheless, the stakes are high in the Ukraine crisis—and South Korea is watching closely.

South Asia

Michael Kugelman, Deputy Director, Asia Program

Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan happened to be in Moscow when the invasion was launched. He met with Putin today for a prescheduled meeting on bilateral relations. The Prime Minister’s Office then released a statement that included this:

“The Prime Minister regretted the latest situation between Russia and Ukraine and said that Pakistan had hoped diplomacy could avert a military conflict. The Prime Minister stressed that conflict was not in anyone’s interest and that the developing countries were always hit the hardest economically in case of conflict. He underlined Pakistan’s belief that disputes should be resolved through dialogue and diplomacy.”

A statement made by India’s UN Ambassador TS Tirumurti last night included this: “The situation is in danger of spiraling into a major crisis. We express our deep concern over the developments, which if not handled carefully, may well undermine the peace and security of the region…We call for immediate de-escalation and refraining from any further action that could contribute to a worsening of the situation.”

Both Pakistan and India are in a difficult diplomatic spot. Pakistan has deepened partnership with Russia in recent years, while India has a longstanding relationship with Moscow going back to the early Cold War days. They will hesitate to criticize Russia, though we can expect some light criticism if the invasion is expanded.

India is in a worse bind than Pakistan given that it has a close and growing partnership with Washington. Indian silence won’t damage relations with Washington, but it does mean India will likely face increased pressure from Washington to reduce its arms imports from Russia (India has already reduced these imports in recent years).

India’s interests could be negatively impacted by the Ukraine crisis because it may lead to stronger relations between Russia and India’s rival China, and because it could distract Washington and its Western partners from focusing on an Indo Pacific policy that is strongly supported by India because of its focus on countering China.",https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/world-reaction-invasion-ukraine
5,64fd3730-cc18-46e3-bff9-19beda2de668,[],2022-02-11 00:00:00,"Hours after speakers took the floor in the 193-member General Assembly to denounce Russia’s actions towards Ukraine and appeal for diplomacy, Mr. Guterres said that instead of repeating what he’d stated there, his political chief would update the Council on “a number of events” that had taken place during the day.

But before handing the microphone to her, he drew attention to rumours that were circulating that an offensive against Ukraine was imminent.

About an hour into the Council meeting, President Putin announced in Moscow that a 'special military operation' in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region had commenced, and that he had asked Ukrainian troops to put down their arms.

Guterres 'saddest moment'

Speaking to journalists after the Security Council session ended, Mr. Guterres called what happened the “saddest moment” in his tenure as UN Secretary-General.

In light of this development, the UN chief said, “I must change my address and say: In the name of humanity bring your troops back to Russia. In the name of humanity to not start what may be the most devastating war since the start of the century.”

Rapidly unfolding events

Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs Rosemary A. DiCarlo told the Council that earlier in the day, the “so-called authorities of the Donetsk and Luhansk Peoples Republics” had requested military assistance from Russia.

Meanwhile, the Ukrainian authorities declared a nationwide state of emergency and announced other related defence and security measures, including the mobilization of reservists.

Under the present circumstances, I must change my appeal:



President Putin, in the name of humanity, bring your troops back to Russia.



This conflict must stop now. — António Guterres (@antonioguterres) February 24, 2022

“Throughout the day we have seen disturbing reports of continued heavy shelling across the contact line and civilian and military casualties…the repeated targeting of civilian infrastructure…[and] an ongoing large-scale military build-up and military columns moving towards Ukraine,” she said.

Moreover, Russia has also reportedly shut airspace to civilian aircraft near the border with Ukraine.

“The United Nations cannot verify any of these reports, but if these developments were confirmed, they would greatly aggravate an already extremely dangerous situation,” she said.

The Ukrainian authorities are also reporting a new large-scale cyber-attack targeting several State and financial institutions.

Staying and delivering

UN staff remain on the ground to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Ukraine, Ms. DiCarlo said, adding, “we are committed to staying and delivering”.

“All parties must ensure the safety and security. Respect for international humanitarian law and international human rights law is also paramount”, she stated.

While the world cannot predict what will happen in the coming hours and days ahead, Ms. DiCarlo said that “what is clear is the unacceptably high cost – in human suffering and destruction – of an escalation,"" concluded the senior UN official.

UN Photo/Mark Garten Rosemary DiCarlo (right), Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, addresses an emergency Security Council meeting on the situation in Ukraine.

‘Perilous moment’

US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said that the meeting was being held tonight because, along with Ukraine, “we believe that a full-scale further invasion is imminent”.

She pointed to the closing of airspace by the Russian authorities, as well as moving troops into Donbas and moving other forces into combat-ready positions.

“This is a perilous moment and we’re here for one reason, and one reason only: to ask Russia to stop. Return to your borders. Send your troops, your tanks, and your planes back to their barracks and hangars. And send your diplomats to the negotiating table. Back away from the brink, before it is too late.”

Ms. Thomas-Greenfield reminded the Council that Russia had called previous predictions “hysterical”, saying that US was ""lying and supplying the world with misinformation.""

“But what we said would happen has come to pass, for all the world to see,” the US Ambassador spelled out. “We must confront this threat head-on”.

‘Unjustifiable blow’ to peace

French Ambassador Nicolas de Rivière said that Russia was on the verge of provoking chaos in Ukraine and striking “an unjustifiable blow to peace and security in the heart of Europe”.

He said that President Putin had been planning this assault for months and had consistently and patiently undermined Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.

“Throughout all this, Ukraine has shown remarkable restraint, including restraining from violence,” Mr. de Rivière said.

He reminded that European allies and the United States had consistently expressed commitment to work together with Russia to seek a diplomatic solution and “the international community had made its united voice heard earlier today in the General Assembly, calling for respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty.

The French Ambassador said that “if Russia confirms that its choice is war it will have to take all the responsibility and pay the price.”

‘A gun to Ukraine’s head’

UK Ambassador Dame Barbara Woodward noted that for months, Russia has been holding “a gun to Ukraine’s head”.

Members of the Security Council, General Assembly, and the Secretary-General himself had been calling for an end to Russia’s aggression.

“The world is calling for peace, but Russia is not listening,” she said.

As such, the United Kingdom, she said, will not compromise its commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.

“We will not compromise our commitment to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter…most of all the founding principle that we live together as good neighbors,” concluded Ms. Woodward.

Root of the crisis

Russian Ambassador Vasily Alekseevich Nebenzya, who is serving as the President of the Council for February, said that after listening to the statements tonight and in recent days, it was difficult to explain intensification of shelling by the Ukrainian regime of civilians by in Donetsk and Luhansk.

All the speakers seemed not to care for those people “who are living in basements. They seemed not to care about the refugees that are fleeing to Russia,” he said, as if ""those four million people simply don’t exist.”

“We tried yesterday and the day before to explain the logic by which Russia recognized the regions in the Donbas, but you just didn’t want to hear it; then or now. The people of the Donbas have been living in fear for the past eight years under Ukraine’s shelling and aggressions,” he said.

The Russian Ambassador stated that “the root of today’s crisis around Ukraine is Ukraine itself, which has for years been undermining the Minsk Agreements and calls for de-escalation”.

He told Council members that he had just learned that President Putin had announced a special military operation in the region, but that was all he knew and would need more time to gather specific information.

“I will keep you appraised of the situation,” he said and added that “occupation of Ukraine is not in our plan, our plan is to protect the people [in the Donbas] from the genocide perpetrated by the regime in Kyiv.”

Too late for de-escalation

Ukrainian Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya said that most of his statement was “useless now” after the Russian Ambassador had stated openly from the floor of the Council that President Putin had “declared war on my country”.

He welcomed the intention of some Council members to submit a resolution condemning aggression against Ukraine, saying “there is no purgatory for war criminals. They go straight to hell.”

Mr. Kyslytsya asked the Russian Ambassador to clarify whether Ukraine was being bombed “at this very moment.”

“It's too late, dear collagues, to speak about de-escalation. Too late. The Russian President declared a war. Should I play the video of your President? You declared a war. It’s responsibility of this body to stop the war”, Mr. Kyslytsya said, directing his comments to Russian Ambassador Nebenzya. “You have a smartphone. You can call” officials in Moscow.

Considering this “declaration of war”, the Ukrainian Ambassador said that the Russian Federation should “relinquish the responsibilities of Council President and transfer them to a responsible member of the Council who... respects the UN Charter.""

He also requested that the Secretary-General distribute legal UN memorandums from December 1991, particularly 19 December of that year, including a decision by the Security Council recommending that the Russian Federation be a Member State of the Organization. “It would be a miracle if the Secretariat is able to produce such decisions,” he said.

In the meantime, the Security Council should pause tonight's session to consider all resolutions and recommendations to stop the war.

“I call on every one of you to do everything possible to stop the war,” he concluded.

Before the end of the meeting, several members of the Council took the floor a second time to condemn President Putin's announcement of Russia's so-called “special military operation” in areas of eastern Ukraine.",https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/02/1112592

KYIV UNDER ASSAULT

WHILE YOU (WEREN’T) SLEEPING: Russia’s army closed in on Kyiv overnight, tightening the noose on the capital. Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba reported “horrific Russian rocket strikes on Kyiv,” adding: “Last time our capital experienced anything like this was in 1941 when it was attacked by Nazi Germany. Ukraine defeated that evil and will defeat this one. Stop Putin. Isolate Russia.” As air raids were announced, people in Kyiv and in Kharkiv in northeast Ukraine sheltered in underground stations and basements. Here are the scenes on the ground and in the air. There are reports of civilians injured. Latest here.

Zelenskiy stands his ground: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy remains in the capital, despite saying in a video statement published to his Telegram account overnight that Russia “has marked me as the No. 1 target” and his family “as No. 2.” He ordered a general mobilization of Ukrainians, with all men aged between 18 and 60 banned from leaving the country.

LATEST VIDEO: In a video published on his Telegram account just after 6 a.m. Brussels time this morning, Zelenskiy said Russian forces had resumed attacks across Ukraine, hitting both civilian and military targets. “This morning we are defending our state alone. Like yesterday, the world’s most powerful forces are watching from afar. Did yesterday’s sanctions convince Russia? We hear in our sky and see on our earth that this was not enough,” he said.

Still fighting: But Zelenskiy said Ukraine had not been defeated, claiming its forces had stopped Russian troops from advancing in “most directions.” He said: “It will not be possible to destroy our character. Kalibr missiles are helpless against our freedom.”

‘We see you’: After his update in Ukrainian, Zelenskiy switched to the Russian language to address his neighbors. “Respected citizens of the Russian Federation,” Zelenskiy began. “As I said earlier tonight, [Russia] has started bombing civilian areas of Kyiv. This reminds me of 1941. All citizens of Russia who are going out to protest, I want to say, we see you. This means you have heard us. This means you are starting to trust us. Fight for us. Fight against war.”

Cost of protest: Zelenskiy was referring to the scores of Russians who took to the streets in 53 cities across the country, from Saint Petersburg to Novosibirsk, to protest the war despite the personal risks. Police arrested at least 1,700 of them, as POLITICO’s Victor Jack reports.

MOSCOW’S GAME PLAN 1: “The nature of the military invasion indicates that the main purpose of the Kremlin regime is to block Kyiv, create a land corridor to the occupied Crimean peninsula and a self-proclaimed Transnistria,” said the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine in a note overnight.

Moscow’s game plan 2: In a background call with reporters, including our POLITICO colleagues in the U.S., a senior U.S. Defense official said Russia intends to “decapitate” the democratic government in Kyiv. Putin’s forces are “making a move on Kyiv,” the official said, “basically decapitating the government and installing their own method of governance.”

UKRAINE’S GAME PLAN: Ukraine’s government is now hoping that protests and tough international sanctions will increase the pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war. “We are actively using samples of modern weapons received from partners. The world is imposing sanctions. Anti-war demonstrations have begun in Russia. Tomorrow Russians will learn about the price of Putin’s madness,” Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said overnight.

Don’t count on EUCO to help with that: The sad truth is that EU leaders let down their Ukrainian partners overnight, as Germany, France and Italy opposed the kind of tough sanctions requested by Kyiv. Crucially, EU leaders are not kicking Russia out of the SWIFT payments system, because they want to protect the business interests of companies such as French investment bank Société Génerale and Italy’s UniCredit and want to keep buying gas from Russia, officials said. More on that here from POLITICO’s Hans von der Burchard and Jacopo Barigazzi.

Falling on deaf ears: EU leaders ignored Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba’s warning: “Everyone who now doubts whether Russia should be banned from SWIFT has to understand that the blood of innocent Ukrainian men, women and children will be on their hands too.”

PROTECTING THE EASTERN FLANK: One big fear in Europe is that if Putin wins quickly in Ukraine and sees how little resistance the West mounted, he may be emboldened to attack other former Soviet Republics, such as EU members Latvia, Lithuania or Estonia. NATO on Thursday activated its defense plans for Eastern Europe, giving the supreme allied commander wide-ranging powers to command troops and move units. The United States has also sent thousands of additional troops to the eastern flank.

Zelenskiy directly warned EU leaders last night: “If you, EU leaders and leaders of the free world, do not really help Ukraine today, tomorrow the war will also knock at your door,” he warned.

REPORT FROM ON THE GROUND — UKRAINIANS FLEE WEST: There were traffic tailbacks stretching more than 10 kilometers from the border crossing between Ukraine and the Polish city of Przemyśl on Thursday night as thousands sought to leave the country and escape the fighting, POLITICO’s Josh Posaner reported from the scene. EU leaders discussed the prospect of refugees escaping Ukraine to the EU, with AFP estimating that 100,000 people have already been displaced.

Many of those traveling on the road to Przemyśl opted to ditch their vehicles and make the final stretch by foot, Josh writes in. But with confusing reports of disruption at the border post some were also turning back and heading toward Lviv, the closest large Ukrainian city. Many of those traveling were carrying young children through freezing temperatures.

Meanwhile, Inclusion Europe reports that 80,000 Ukrainians with disabilities in institutions are at risk of abandonment and need support for basic things such as epilepsy medicine.

EU APPEASEMENT

EU SUMMIT UPDATE: EU leaders on Thursday night agreed a set of new sanctions on Russia. Legal experts from the 27 countries are combing through the text, with a deadline of 8 a.m. this morning for them to be finalized. The plan is for EU ambassadors to formally adopt the sanctions at 10 a.m.

WHAT WAS AGREED: EU leaders went for middle-of-the-ground penalties that will impose costs on Russia over the medium term, but are unlikely to trigger an immediate internal opposition against the war in Moscow. Leaders agreed …

1. Financial sanctions targeting 70 percent of the Russian banking sector (but exempting the most lucrative energy transactions).

2. Export restrictions.

3. Sanctioning more individuals.

WHAT WASN’T AGREED: Oil and gas imports won’t be curbed, SWIFT was left off the table at the behest of France, Italy and Germany, and Putin, who ordered the invasion, will not be sanctioned personally.

Too weak: While leaders such as Commission President Ursula von der Leyen insisted the sanctions would slowly but surely cripple Russia’s economy, other officials said they are unlikely to be sudden and painful enough to act as a deterrent against further aggressions.

The export restrictions, for example, include a ban on semiconductors and Airbus repair parts — meaning Russia’s airlines will be starved over the medium term as their airplanes deteriorate. But that’s a cost that will only accumulate gradually, likely after the war will be over.

Similarly, while the financial sanctions are expected to add some bite, Moscow’s main source of revenue — energy exports — has been explicitly exempt, meaning banks can still bankroll gas and oil sales.

SWIFT is the new Nord Stream: German Finance Minister Christian Lindner last night confirmed Berlin is hesitant about cutting Russia off from SWIFT because “that would mean that there is a high risk that Germany will no longer be supplied with gas or raw materials,” he told the Maischberger talk show. France and Italy also opposed SWIFT sanctions behind closed doors.

BITING THE HAND THAT FEEDS YOU: Russia’s war has also brought into focus decades of coziness between senior European figures and Russian business and energy interests. Former Germany Chancellor Gerhard Schröder and former Prime Minister of France François Fillon are being considered for British sanctions, Britain’s chair of the foreign affairs committee Tom Tugendhat said. Both men are on the boards of Russian energy companies.

BUT IT GOES FURTHER BACK. When the history books are written, the past few months may well look like one giant exercise in appeasement, with devastating consequences. Europe needs to ask itself why it didn’t take a tougher line on Russia in 2014 when it illegally annexed Crimea and moved into the Donbass region — and why leaders such as French President Emmanuel Macron kept believing Putin was a partner the EU could negotiate a new security architecture with. As many officials admit in secret, the hard truth is that had Ukraine been admitted as a member of NATO, the country would not be in its current situation.

EU HELPLESSNESS: Zelenskiy addressed EU leaders via video during their summit last night. While the Council did not publish his address, Zelenskiy said he had asked them whether they would back Ukraine’s NATO accession. “Today, I have asked the 27 European leaders whether Ukraine can join NATO. I asked directly — everyone was afraid, no one answered,” he said.

NOW READ THIS: Who’s paying for Putin’s jet fighters and tanks? The same EU countries that say they want him to stop his assault on Ukraine, a country that is supposedly their ally. Must-read.

MACRON ON THE DEFENSIVE: Emmanuel Macron called his counterpart Putin last night — with French officials only confirming the call after Russian state media had reported it. According to an Elysée spokesperson, “the President called Vladimir Putin to demand the immediate cessation of military operations, recalling that Russia would be exposed to massive sanctions.” Facing repeated questions, Macron told reporters he had called Putin at Zelenskiy’s request.

SPEAKING OF RUSSIAN STATE MEDIA — WHAT TO DO ABOUT RT? Europe is increasing the pressure on Kremlin-backed broadcaster RT, report POLITICO’s Laura Kayali and Clothilde Goujard.

BEIJING-MOSCOW AXIS: Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov Thursday. According to Chinese state media, Wang said he “understands Russia’s reasonable concerns on security issues.” Russia’s state-backed Tass news agency said the ministers “also expressed their joint opinion that the current crisis was caused by Kyiv’s rejection — encouraged by the U.S. and its allies — of implementation of the Minsk Package of Measures.”

TALKS CONTINUE TODAY IN BRUSSELS: Emergency talks will continue today as the EU scrambles to respond to the rapidly evolving situation. These include:

— An emergency meeting of NATO heads of state and government this afternoon.

— At the same time in Brussels foreign affairs ministers will meet to sign off on the sanctions agreed last night.

— European finance ministers will gather in Paris for a joint Eurogroup and Ecofin Council that has been curtailed and radically repurposed to deal with the financial implications of the war.

— And European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will attend a meeting of the Bucharest 9, the group of NATO’s easternmost countries.

DAMNING FRONTEX REPORT DUE: The EU’s anti-fraud watchdog, OLAF, is due to present its report into border-management agency Frontex to its management board today.

Background: As Jacopo Barigazzi writes in to report, OLAF launched its probe in January last year, with its investigators searching the offices of Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri and his then-head of Cabinet, Thibauld de La Haye Jousselin. The investigation was launched over allegations of harassment, misconduct and migrant pushbacks. POLITICO hears that during the board meeting, disciplinary actions are expected to be discussed. But an OLAF spokesperson didn’t confirm that: “Once OLAF has completed its investigation, it is for the competent EU authorities to examine and decide on the follow-up of OLAF’s recommendation,” they said.

Personnel issues: Two officials told Playbook that de La Haye Jousselin was recently promoted within the agency, to the role of director of the “governance support center” division — despite last year’s raid. They also said the promotion was done without undergoing any formal recruitment procedure. A Frontex spokesperson confirmed that “Thibauld de la Haye Jousselin has been reassigned to the role of Director of the Governance Support Center” but said that “he has been reassigned internally to the new role, with the same category of post and grade, and in line with legal procedures.”

BREXIT REALITY BITES: British citizens who live in the EU should no longer have the same rights as EU27 citizens after Brexit, according to an opinion published Thursday by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). Britons “who enjoyed the benefits of union citizenship do not retain those advantages following the U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU” after it had “voluntarily abandoned” the status of being a member country, wrote Irish Advocate General Anthony Collins.

Background: Collins was responding to a case brought to the Luxembourg-based court by a retired British civil servant who had lived in the France for 37 years but was left unable to vote in French municipal elections after Brexit in 2020. More details from Victor Jack here.

AGENDA

— Foreign affairs ministers meeting, Brussels. 3 p.m.

— Also EU ambassadors meet at 10 a.m. to consider sanctions package.

— Meeting of NATO heads of state and government via videoconference, 3 p.m. French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and U.S. President Joe Biden to attend.

— Eurogroup and Ecofin finance ministers meet in Paris; Eurogroup 9 a.m; Ecofin 10 a.m., press conference at 3 p.m.

7,64fd3730-cc18-46e3-bff9-19beda2de668,[],2022-02-17 00:00:00,"The High Court says it will hear a petition against Israel’s policy regarding Ukrainian refugees in a week, rejecting the state’s request to throw the case out.

On Sunday night, Interior Minister Ayelet Shaked announced that people who are fleeing Ukraine who have relatives in Israel will be exempt from a 25,000-person entry cap placed on those refugees who are not eligible for Israeli citizenship.

Shaked’s announcement came after news that attorney Tomer Warsha had filed — on behalf of Ukrainian Ambassador to Israel Yevgen Korniychuk — a petition to the High Court against the interior minister’s earlier policy, which counted those ineligible for citizenship against the cap, which also includes 20,000 Ukrainians already in Israel.

Warsha, an attorney specializing in immigration, said Sunday evening that Shaked’s new policy was a positive change, but not enough.

According to reports, the state told the court that the cap would not be met for a week, meaning the issue won’t become relevant until then.

Speaking to Kan, Justice Minister Gideon Sa’ar backs Shaked’s decision to allow in more Ukrainians. But he appears to chafe at the description of those fleeing to Israel’s borders as “refugees,” which he says carries “certain legal ramifications.”

“Israel is sheltering those who need it, it’s the humane, correct thing to do,” he says, “and that’s what Israel has done the last two weeks.”

According to statistics published by the Population and Border Authority on Sunday morning, 7,179 Ukrainian nationals have arrived in Israel since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, and 221 were refused entry. The statistics included those who are immigrating and who are eligible to do so under the Law of Return, which grants citizenship to anyone with one Jewish grandparent.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-march-13-2022-2/
