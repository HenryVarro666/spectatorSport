CNN —

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russian troops of indiscriminately killing civilians “just for their pleasure” in an emotionally-charged address to the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday, before questioning the very mandate of the Security Council itself.

Zelensky’s speech came a day after he visited the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, where shocking images of bodies in the streets emerged over the weekend.

On Tuesday, he related the aftermath of Russia’s retreat from the town in horrifying detail, describing entire families killed, people with their throats slashed, and women raped and killed in front of their children. Zelensky said Russia’s actions were no different from those of a terror group, except that Russia is a permanent member of the UNSC.

The Ukrainian leader then criticized the body, asking representatives point blank: “Where is the security that the Security Council needs to guarantee? It is not there, though there is a Security Council.”

Zelensky added: “It is obvious that the key institution of the world designed to combat aggression and ensure peace cannot work effectively.

“Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to remind you of Article 1, Chapter 1 of the UN Charter. What is the purpose of our organization? Its purpose is to maintain and make sure that peace is adhered to. And now the UN charter is violated literally starting with Article 1. And so what is the point of all other Articles?” he asked.

At least 1,480 civilians have been killed and at least 2,195 have been injured in Ukraine between the start of the Russian invasion on February 24 and April 4, a UN official said at the meeting, citing updated numbers from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). The latest figures on the number of Ukrainian civilians in the conflict had “more than doubled” since the last briefing to the UNSC on March 17.

In Bucha, bodies strewn across the streets and in basements were found by human rights groups and documented by independent journalists. Satellite images suggest some bodies had been there since at least March 18.

In his damning speech, Zelensky said there was “not a single crime” that the Russians “would not commit,” alleging that Russian troops had “searched for and purposefully killed anyone who served our country.”

“They shot and killed women outside their houses when they just tried to call someone … They killed entire families, adults and children and they tried to burn the bodies,” Zelensky said.

“I am addressing you on behalf of the people who honor the memory of the deceased every single day and in the memory of the civilians who died, who were shot and killed in the back of their head after being tortured,” he told the UNSC.

“Some of them were shot on the streets. Others were thrown into wells, so they died there suffering. They were killed in their apartments, houses, blown up by grenades. Civilians were crushed by tanks while sitting in their cars in the middle of the road, just for their pleasure,” he continued. “Women were raped and killed in front of their children. Their tongues were pulled out only because the aggressor did not hear what they wanted to hear from them.”

Zelensky also warned that the horrors found in Bucha would be replicated in other cities across Ukraine. Demanding accountability, he called for any Russians who have given “criminal orders” and “carried out them by killing our people” to be brought before a tribunal, similar to the Nuremberg trials that occurred after World War II when Nazis were put on trial.

UN: Civilians were targeted

Separately, the United Nations on Tuesday said that the shocking images from Bucha showed “all the signs” that civilians were “directly targeted and directly killed.”

In a virtual press briefing, OHCHR spokesperson Liz Throssell said the reports emerging from Bucha and other areas were “very disturbing developments.”

She specifically referenced the “disturbing” images of people with their hands tied behind their back and of partially naked women whose bodies have been burnt as further evidence suggesting the direct targeting of individuals.

“We have been talking about war crimes in the context of shelling, bombardment, and artillery attacks. Now they need to be investigated. But you could argue there was a military context, for example, to a building being hit. It’s hard to see what was the military context of an individual lying in the street with a bullet to the head or having their bodies burned,” Throssell continued.

As the OHCHR is trying to currently gain access to Bucha, she didn’t have “exact information” to share regarding the situation on the ground.

Throssell also paid tribute to the “crucial role” that journalists are playing in documenting these scenes, mentioning the “multiple teams” involved in “reporting, analyzing, and sending video footage.”

Russia’s response

Russia has repeatedly denied the alleged atrocities, despite increasing evidence suggesting otherwise. Vassily Nebenzia, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations responded to Zelensky’s remarks, calling the accusations against the Russian military “ungrounded.”

“We place on your conscience the ungrounded accusations against the Russian military, which are not confirmed by any eyewitnesses,” Nebenzia said in translated remarks.

The ambassador recalled Zelensky’s election to the Ukrainian presidency in 2019, stating that hopes that Zelensky would end the fighting in the Donbas region of Ukraine “failed to materialize.”

Nebenzia also repeated past claims that “a huge amount of lies about Russian soldiers and military” continue to proliferate.

Addressing Zelensky directly, Nebenzia concluded his remarks by claiming Russia “came to … Ukraine” to bring peace, not to “conquer lands.”

Nebenzia’s words echoed those of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov earlier Tuesday, who called the allegations not only “groundless, but … a well-staged tragic show” and “a forgery in order to try to denigrate the Russian army.”",https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/05/world/zelensky-ukraine-united-nations-speech-intl/index.html

Speaking via video link to the U.N. Security Council, he compared Russian forces to the Islamic State, called for a Nuremberg-like war crimes tribunal and vented his bitter frustration, knowing that the council — where Russia is one of five permanent members with veto power — would do nothing but talk.

“Where is the security that the Security Council needs to guarantee?” Mr. Zelensky said, raising the question of whether Russia deserved to keep its seat on the council. “Are you ready to close the U.N.? Do you think that the time of international law is gone? If your answer is no, then you need to act immediately.”

The chamber fell silent as a short video provided by Mr. Zelensky’s government played, showing some of the hundreds of corpses found strewn around the city of Bucha, northwest of Kyiv, after Russian forces retreated last week — bloated, charred bodies of civilians, including children.

Russian forces carrying out frontal assaults in the east are making “little to no progress” and are facing supply issues and declining morale, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank. Russian troops being redeployed to the east will need significant amounts of equipment repairs and new hardware, British defense intelligence said today.

A small swath of land in the east encompasses Donetsk and Luhansk, two breakaway enclaves that are collectively known as the Donbas, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian government forces for eight years. Many Ukrainian forces are still entrenched there.

Russian troops have been able to solidify their front lines with the seizure of Izium, a city some 75 miles southeast of Kharkiv, last week. Russia now appears to be pivoting to seize the eastern city of Sloviansk in the coming days, the Institute for the Study of War said.

“Efforts by Russian forces advancing from Izium to capture Sloviansk and threaten Ukrainian forces in Donbas with encirclement will likely prove to be the next pivotal battle of the war in Ukraine,” the institute said. “If Russian forces are unable to take Sloviansk, Russia’s campaign to capture the entirety of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts will likely fail.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/05/briefing/russia-ukraine-war-briefing-zelensky-un-east.html

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of war crimes Tuesday in a remote appearance before the U.N. Security Council that included gruesome video of dead bodies, challenging diplomats to take bold action or risk exposing the world body as a hollow institution. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight “Are you ready to close the U.N.?” asked a tired-looking Zelensky, looming over the council chamber on a massive video screen. “Do you think that the time of international law is gone? If your answer is no, then you need to act immediately.”

Zelensky said Russian troops have tortured and killed civilians, burned bodies and raped women in front of their children. His video showed images of charred bodies, severed limbs and mass graves. While The Washington Post could not independently confirm the accuracy of the stylized presentation, many similar images have been verified in recent days. And journalists who have entered parts of Ukraine recently cleared of Russian troops have published multiple interviews about atrocities allegedly committed during the invasion.

The presentation appeared to unsettle diplomats at the council; even nations that have been painstakingly neutral through many meetings over the Ukraine situation, such as India, lined up to call for an independent investigation into the alleged atrocities. But diplomats, limited by Russia’s ability to veto any resolutions under its powers as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, did not take any action in response to Zelensky’s proposal to lift Moscow’s membership in the Human Rights Council.

Many of the photos in Zelensky’s video were said to have been taken in Bucha, a town outside of Kyiv recently retaken by Ukrainian forces, where Russian troops have been accused of killing numerous civilians. Publication of verified images from Bucha over the weekend led to widespread outrage and calls for the international community to increase its pressure on Russia for a cease fire and withdrawal of its forces from Ukraine.

Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations, Vasily Nebenzya, told the council that the reports of Russian involvement in the Bucha deaths were “fake,” and that Ukrainian “Nazis” were responsible for war crimes.

But Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking to reporters as he left Washington for a NATO meeting in Brussels, called the reports of Russian responsibility “more than credible.” The alleged massacres were “not the random act of a rogue unit,” he said, but a “deliberate campaign to kill, to torture, to rape, to commit atrocities.”

“The evidence is there for the world to see,” Blinken said. “This reinforces our determination and the determination of countries around the world to make sure that one way or another, one day or another, there is accountability for those who committed these acts.”

Ukrainian human rights organizations and prosecutors are gathering information in Bucha and around the country for what Zelensky said should be an international tribunal to prosecute Russian government and military officials for war crimes. France said its counterterrorism prosecutor’s office had opened three probes into alleged crimes by Russian forces, claiming jurisdiction because of acts in Ukrainian cities that were likely to have affected French nationals.

In a move responding to the alleged massacres, the European Commission proposed a new package of sanctions Tuesday, including a ban on Russian coal imports, sanctions on four Russian banks and a ban on Russian vessels from European ports, among other measures. The proposal is to be debated by the European Union’s ambassadors on Wednesday.

“These atrocities cannot and will not be left unanswered,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. “It is important to sustain utmost pressure on [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and the Russian government at this crucial point.” But the package does not meet demands for an embargo on Russian oil or natural gas and is unlikely to quiet calls for the E.U. to do more.

As Russia’s isolation from the West deepened, the E.U. joined a number of countries that have expelled Russian diplomats, saying it had declared 19 members of Russia’s E.U. mission in Brussels persona non grata for “activities contrary to their diplomatic mission.”

The U.S. Treasury Department this week prohibited Russia from withdrawing funds held in American banks to pay debt obligations, an attempt to force the Kremlin to pick between a catastrophic default and other difficult economic measures. And the Biden administration on Wednesday will announce sanctions including a ban on all new investment in Russia, sanctions on Russian banks and state-owned enterprises, and additional sanctions on Russian government officials, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reflect measures not yet announced.

The Biden administration on Tuesday approved sending additional Javelin antitank missile systems to Ukraine to aid in its defense against Russia. The $100 million worth of Javelins is the sixth such drawdown of equipment from the Pentagon’s inventories since August, said Pentagon spokesman John F. Kirby.

Also Tuesday, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark A. Milley, endorsed the idea of steadily rotating U.S. troops to NATO countries as a way of bolstering its border with Russia.

“My advice would be to create permanent bases but don’t permanently station,” Milley told the House Armed Services Committee. Rotating forces through permanent bases would be cheaper, he said, because it would remove the need for things like family housing and schools. Eastern European countries might even be willing to pay for the bases, Milley said.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, testifying alongside Milley, was more circumspect, saying that NATO would discuss any change in its European “footprint” at its planned summit in June.

While the Security Council could not take any action over Moscow’s objection, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield urged nations to vote to suspend Russia from the Human Rights Council — a move that requires a two-thirds vote of all member nations and would not be subject to a veto.

“Russia should not have a position of authority in a body whose purpose is to promote respect for human rights,” she told the Council session. “Not only is it the height of hypocrisy, it is dangerous. Russia is using its membership on the Human Rights Council as a platform for propaganda to suggest Russia has a legitimate concern for human rights.”

The 193-member General Assembly last month overwhelmingly condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which indicates a suspension — reserved for countries that persistently violate human rights — would be approved.

In his response to Zelensky, Russian U.N. ambassador Nebenzya addressed the Ukrainian president by his first name and Russian patronymic, telling him: “We place on your conscience the ungrounded accusations against the Russian military, which are not confirmed by any eyewitnesses.”

Russia’s goal in Ukraine, he said, was “not to conquer lands” but to bring “peace to the blood-soaked land of Donbas,” the largely Russian-speaking eastern Ukrainian region where Russian troops and mercenaries have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014. “We need to root out the cruelty, cut out the malignant Nazi tumor,” Nebenzya said. “We will achieve that goal.”

But Moscow’s claims faced stiff pushback in the council from countries including France, Norway, Britain and the United States, as well as U.N. officials. Secretary General António Guterres denounced the “senseless loss of life” and “destruction of civilian infrastructure” and added his support to calls for an independent investigation. Undersecretary General Rosemary A. DiCarlo called on Russia to withdraw from Ukraine and said serious violations of international law must be held to account.

Zelensky, seizing on the stomach-churning images of bodies bound at the wrists with bullet wounds to the head, called on the international community to bring Russian leaders and soldiers before a special tribunal to be tried “immediately.”

If the United Nations is incapable of preventing violations such as Russia’s in Ukraine, and of fostering peace, it should dissolve itself, Zelensky said: “Admit it if there is nothing you can do besides conversation.”

U.S. and European officials have said privately that although Zelensky’s requests have at times been implausible, they have had the effect of pushing world leaders beyond their comfort zone, such as providing more powerful weapons to Ukraine or implementing sanctions that hurt Russia but increase costs of gas and other products for their own citizenry.

Nebenzya, speaking again in response to interventions from other members, offered a lengthy timeline that he said demonstrated how Ukrainian, not Russian, forces were responsible for any atrocities. Russian troops, he said, had withdrawn from Bucha last Wednesday, March 30, three days before reports of tortured, shot and burned bodies lying in the streets were widely circulated.

“Without any evidence, based on a presumption of guilt, the Russian army is being accused of some kind of evil deeds,” Nebenzya said.

Addressing “my colleagues” on the council through a U.N. interpreter, he said “we understand very well that what you’re doing by fueling anti-Russia hysteria every single day, so we are assuming that there will be further horrible provocations similar to the one in Bucha ... new attempts to discredit Russian soldiers and present them as murderers and rapists.” It was, he said, an “incredibly low blow.”

He then glared across the council chamber at Ukrainian U.N. Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya, who called Russia a hypocrite, asking: “When have you started enjoying acting like Nazis? Killing civilians, attempting to redraw internationally recognized borders ... setting the task to finally resolve the Ukraine issue, like Hitler attempted to resolve the Jewish issue?”

Offering “a reminder, to Putin’s diplomats,” Kyslytsya recalled that officials from Nazi Germany, such as Joachim von Ribbentrop, who served as Hitler’s foreign minister, “denied any knowledge of concentration camps, racial extermination policies, yet was found guilty at the Nuremberg war crimes trial.”

“And we all know what happened to him on the 16th of October 1946,” Kyslytsya said, recalling the date when Ribbentrop was executed.

United Nations (United States) (AFP) – Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky challenged the United Nations to ""act immediately"" or ""dissolve yourself altogether"" during a blistering address in which he showed a harrowing video of dead bodies -- including children -- he said were victims of Russian atrocities.

Likening Russia's actions in Ukrainian cities such as Bucha to violence carried out by ""terrorists"" such as the Islamic State group, Zelensky called on the 15-member council -- which aims to ensure international peace and security -- to expel Russia ""so it cannot block decisions about its own aggression, its own war.""

Russia, as one of the five permanent members of the Security Council, has a veto, which it has repeatedly wielded to block resolutions and negotiations on the global stage.

""If there is no alternative and no option, then the next option would be dissolve yourself altogether,"" Zelensky continued.

The United Nations could be ""simply closed,"" he said. ""Ladies and gentlemen, are you ready to close the UN? And the time of international law is gone? If your answer is no, then you need to act immediately.""

Bearded and dressed in his now trademark military green T-shirt, Zelensky gave a chilling rendition of the atrocities he said were carried out by Russian troops against civilians in Bucha, a town outside the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, and aired the graphic video showing dead bodies, including several children.

""They were killed in their apartments, houses, blowing up grenades, civilians were crushed by tanks while sitting in their cars in the middle of the road, just for their pleasure. They cut off limbs... slashed their throats,"" he said.

""Women were raped and killed in front of their children, their tongues were pulled out only because the aggressors did not hear what they wanted to hear from them.

""So this is no different from other terrorists such as Daesh who occupied some territory, and here it is done by a member of the United Nations Security Council,"" he said, using another acronym for the Islamic State group.

""Accountability must be inevitable,"" he said, adding that ""hundreds of thousands"" of Ukrainians had also been deported to Russia.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres opened the meeting by warning of the global fallout from the conflict, with soaring food, energy and fertilizer prices affecting up to 1.2 billion people in 74 countries.

""The war in Ukraine must stop -- now,"" Guterres told the Council, after calling it ""one of the greatest challenges ever to the international order.""

""We need serious negotiations for peace, based on the principles of the United Nations Charter,"" he said.

UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths is also due to update the body after his recent visit to Moscow.

Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, sparking outrage across the world and displacing millions of Ukrainians.

6,266c255e-4f45-4bfc-b67c-39aad2d048a6,[],2022-04-05,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky gave voice to a terrible truth in his UN speech Tuesday: The United Nations is an utter failure.

If the organization won’t actually work to end Russia’s Ukraine war, he said, it should dissolve itself.

“Are you ready to close?” he asked the assembled dignitaries, after pointing out that the brutal war violates the UN Charter’s first article.

He’s right to ask. Long fetishized by progressives around the globe as the last bulwark of civilization against unending war, the United Nations has proven singularly inept at actually preventing violence and isolating dangerous regimes. In fact, it often empowers them.

As Zelensky put it: “Where is the security that the Security Council is supposed to guarantee?”

Russia’s presence as a permanent member at the Security Council’s table — especially now, in the face of the sickening images of its war crimes in Bucha — makes a mockery both of the UN as an organization and the principles it claims to stand for. Zelensky correctly characterized Russia’s behavior as “no different” from that of ISIS.

The same might be said of China’s permanent membership. Beijing has been waging a brutal internal war against the Uyghurs for years, while facing no real repercussions from a global body ostensibly dedicated to securing all human rights, everywhere.

Liberals in the US have rightly taken up Ukraine as a cause célèbre. But they’ve made no corresponding alignment in conventional wisdom around the toothless, autocrat-coddling institutions allegedly responsible for maintaining the postwar order.

The most Washington seems willing to do in Turtle Bay is try to call a vote suspending Russia from the UN’s Human Rights Council — a committee that is itself an utter farce, packed with member nations that themselves violate rights left and right.

This lame bit of theatrics proves Zelensky’s point all over again. Where has the HRC been as one of its member states bombs maternity hospitals and murders families? (Most likely preparing to bash Israel some more.)

Sovereign states can no longer rely for defense on the norms of international law, but only on the strength of their own arms, the Ukrainian president pointed out as he called for a wholesale reimagining of the UN.

Russia’s crimes in Bucha, Mariupol, Kharkiv and beyond (back to Aleppo and Grozny) provide grim weight to his argument — and expose the hypocrisy that underlies so many groups claiming to defend human rights.

The United Nations is utterly incapable of succeeding in its mission. Believers in its principles should be seeking something better to replace it.",https://nypost.com/2022/04/05/zelensky-is-right-the-united-nations-is-useless/
