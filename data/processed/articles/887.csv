He said the move was “for national security reasons.”

Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told the state-owned news agency TASS that there would be a response from Moscow to the expulsions, without giving details.

The country was later joined in expelling Russian diplomats by Denmark, Sweden, Latvia and Spain, a day after Germany and France did the same.

Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod tweeted: “Denmark will expel 15 Russian intelligence officers working at the Russian embassy in Copenhagen. They pose a threat to our national security. It’s in our mutual interests to maintain diplomatic ties, but we will not accept Russian espionage on Danish soil.”

Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde announced at a press briefing Tuesday that the country would also expel three Russian diplomats, because “they have not acted in accordance with the Vienna Convention and conducted illegal intelligence activities in Sweden.”

Linde did not rule out more diplomats being sent back to Moscow, but said such a decision would have to be examined in light of Sweden’s interests in keeping diplomats in Russia.

Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkēvičs announced that his country would close the two Russian consular posts in Daugavpils and Liepāja. “The diplomatic staff of those Consulates General are declared persona non grata in Latvia,” a statement read. Thirteen Russian diplomats are being expelled. Its Baltic neighbor Estonia expelled 14 staff from its consulates, including seven diplomats. They have until April 30 to leave the country.

Spain, meanwhile, said it would expel 25 Russian envoys, Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said on Tuesday.

They are the latest European countries to expel Russian diplomats. On Monday, the German government made a similar move and sent 40 diplomats back to Moscow, while France kicked out 35 diplomats, saying that their activities were “against our national interests.”

On Tuesday, France’s EU Minister Clément Beaune said that the expulsions “were already discussed and looked at” in consultation with other countries including Germany, but that it was “not only directly related to [the atrocities committed by Russian troops in] Bucha.”

Beaune added that “in some territories, there are people presented as diplomats who were, or could be, threatening our essential interests.”

Lithuania, meanwhile, expelled on Monday Russia’s ambassador to Vilnius and recalled its top envoy to Moscow.

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

The Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, citing its sources, said that the country's authorities intend to announce the expulsion of several dozen Russian diplomats today after similar steps were taken by France, Germany and other European countries.

According to the newspaper, the list of Russian diplomats to be expelled was drawn up the day before, and the decision was made during contacts between the Italian Foreign Ministry and the leadership of the Italian Council of Ministers with Berlin and Paris.

The Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi discussed it with the Secretary of the Council of Ministers Franco Gabrielli, who is responsible for state security issues in the republic, the newspaper writes.

“All Moscow diplomats working in Italy who will be expelled will be declared persona non grata,” the newspaper said, adding that Italian authorities believed the diplomats were linked to Russia's special services.

It later became clear that the Swedish Foreign Ministry had also decided to expel three Russian diplomats, Minister Ann Linde told a news conference.

“Russia's ambassador to Stockholm was summoned to the Foreign Ministry today to receive strong condemnation from Sweden and the EU. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also decided today to deport three Russian diplomats who do not work in Sweden in accordance with the Vienna Convention,” Linde explained.

The Spanish government has also decided to expel about 25 diplomats from the Russian embassy in the kingdom. This was announced at a press conference by Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Alvarez.

“I want to inform you that this morning we have decided to expel from Spain Russian diplomats and employees of the Russian embassy in Spain, who pose a threat to our country's security interests,” he said. “We are talking about 25 people, we are currently refining the list.” The minister said he would give them a few days to leave the country.

The diplomattic feud between the EU and Russia is rapidly escalating.

Italy, Denmark, and Sweden have voted to expel a total of 48 Russian diplomats, making them the latest EU nations to take such action in the ongoing diplomatic crisis sparked by Moscow's operation in Ukraine.

Last week, EU members Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands, and the Czech Republic all declared the expulsion of dozens of Russian diplomats allegedly suspected of spying.

Slovakia soon followed suit with 35 diplomats expelled. Slovakia had expelled three Russian officials for claims of espionage earlier in March, and in retaliation for the country's decision, Russia deemed three Slovakians as persona non grata.

On Tuesday, the foreign ministers of the three nations informed the Russian embassies of their choices.

As part of the measure, Denmark would remove 15 Russian diplomats. Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod has given the Russian ambassador two weeks to depart the country.

The Danish foreign ministry claims Russian diplomats were using their status to collect intelligence for Moscow.

“This will signal to Moscow that we won’t accept Russian intelligence officers spying on Danish territory,” he said.

“They constitute a risk for our national security, which we cannot overlook. Along with a number of our closest allies, we therefore put our foot down on the espionage the identified persons practice under the cover of diplomatic status.”

Despite the expulsion, the Danish Foreign Ministry said it wishes to retain diplomatic ties with Moscow, which is why the ambassador and other members of staff are not being expelled.

Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio also notified the ambassador that the nation will expel 30 Russian diplomats due to ""security concerns.""

Foreign Minister Ann Linde of Sweden announced that the country has decided to deport 3 Russian diplomats ""whose work in Sweden is not in accordance with the Vienna Convention.""

Norway has said it is considering similar moves but has not yet made a decision.

Germany has decided to expel a significant number of Russian diplomats on Monday, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said.

According to AFP, Berlin's move involves 40 Russians.

France on the other hand said on Monday that it will expel 35 Russian diplomats as part of a coordinated European response.",https://english.almayadeen.net/news/politics/48-russian-diplomats-expelled-from-eu-states
