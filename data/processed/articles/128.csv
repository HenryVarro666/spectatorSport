1,670d955b-0837-4c1e-93c1-f2b0cd314967,[],,"Former Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, in an interview with Israel’s Channel 13, thanks Israel and Prime Minister Bennett for mediation efforts between Ukraine and Russia.

“We thank your country and your prime minister… for putting yourselves forward as peacemakers. I very much want to believe in this. But at the same time, I am certain that Putin will not stop. He will go on to the end. He wants to win, and take military control of Ukraine, but I can tell you that he won’t achieve this. Ukraine will fight so that victory is ours,” Tymoshenko says.

She says, “I thank Israel for formally declaring today that it stands with Ukraine.”

Israel has not yet made such a formal declaration, however. Tymoshenko appears to be referring to comments yesterday from Foreign Minister Lapid, who said Israel “condemns the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and calls for an end to the fighting.”

“There is no justification for violating Ukraine’s territorial integrity, and there is no justification for attacks on a civilian population,” Lapid said. “Israel will not be a route to bypass sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States and other Western countries.”

Bennett has refrained from taking a side in the conflict, however.

Tymoshenko says, “Today is really a turning point. Today your foreign minister said clearly that Israel will not be a country that allows the aggressor state to evade the sanctions. Nobody can stand in opposition [to Ukraine’s cause]. You have to be without a conscience, heartless and soulless, devoid of any human emotion to see what is happening in Ukraine and not to stand with it.”

Tymoshenko, Ukraine’s only female prime minister, quotes Israel’s only female prime minister, Ukraine-born Golda Meir.

“Regarding negotiations, I want to quote Golda Meir, who was your prime minister and was born in Kyiv. She said, ‘If the enemy lays down his weapons, there will be peace. If we lay down our weapons, there’ll be war.’ We will not lay down our weapons. We will continue to fight. We’ll continue to defend our country. And if peace talks can contribute, and stop the bloodshed, we will rejoice. But we will permit any limitations and any compromises that threaten our independence and territorial integrity.”

“I thank you very much [in Israel] for defending Ukraine,” she says.

Tymoshenko currently serves as a Deputy of Ukraine. She had extensive dealings with Russian President Putin while she was prime minister in 2005, and from 2007-2010.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-march-15-2022/

3,670d955b-0837-4c1e-93c1-f2b0cd314967,"['Yuras Karmanau', 'Associated Press']",2022-04-15 10:10:00-04:00,"LVIV, Ukraine (AP) — Unbroken by a Russian blockade and relentless bombardment, the key port of Mariupol is still holding out, a symbol of staunch Ukrainian resistance that has thwarted the Kremlin’s invasion plans.

More than six weeks after the Russian siege began, Ukrainian troops are continuing to fight the vastly superior Russian forces in ferocious battles amid the ruins of what once was a bustling city on the Sea of Azov coast.

WATCH: Russian forces enter Mariupol as outgunned Ukrainians prepare for renewed assault

The city’s mayor says that an estimated 120,000 people remain in the city, of Mariupol’s pre-war population of about 450,000.

The Ukrainians’ fight against all odds has scuttled Moscow’s designs, tying up significant Russian forces and delaying the start of a planned Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine’s industrial heartland, Donbas. The Kremlin hopes that an attack in the east could reverse the battlefield fortunes for Russia after a humiliating failure of its attempt to quickly storm the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv.

Mariupol has been a key objective for Russia since the start of its invasion on Feb. 24. Capturing the city would allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014 and deprive Ukraine of a major port and prized industrial assets.

The giant Azovstal steel mill and other industrial plants have been heavily damaged by the ferocious Russian bombardment that has flattened much of Mariupol, indiscriminately hitting homes, hospitals and other public buildings and killing thousands.

The victims include about 300 people killed in last month’s Russian airstrike on the Mariupol Drama Theater that was being used as a shelter and had the word “CHILDREN” printed in Russian in huge white letters on the pavement outside to ward off aerial attack.

Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko told The Associated Press that at least 21,000 people were killed in Mariupol with bodies “carpeted through the streets.” He said that the Russians deployed mobile cremation equipment to Mariupol to methodically dispose of the victims’ bodies in order to hide the evidence of the massacre and prevent international organizations from documenting “the horror the Russian army is responsible for.”

The discovery of hundreds of bodies of civilians apparently executed by Russian forces in Kyiv’s suburbs after the Russian retreat from the area has fueled global outrage and accusations from Ukrainians and the West that Russia is committing war crimes in Ukraine.

Moscow has deployed fighters from Chechnya, known for their ferocity, to wage street battles in Mariupol. Chechnya’s Moscow-backed leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, has repeatedly boasted on his messaging app channel about defeating Ukrainians in Mariupol, but the fight has continued.

Boychenko said that several Ukrainian units are still fighting the Russians in Mariupol, including the 36th Marine Brigade, the Azov Regiment, some Interior Ministry troops and border guards.

The Azov Regiment, a seasoned volunteer force that is widely considered one of the country’s most capable units, is defending the mammoth Azovstal steel plant that covers an area of nearly 11 square kilometers (over 4.2 square miles). It has taken advantage of the plant’s sprawling network of concrete buildings and underground facilities to repel continuous Russian attacks.

The 36th Marine Brigade was maintaining defensive positions at the Azovmash and Zavod Ilyicha factories until it ran out of supplies and ammunition and made a desperate attempt to break through the Russian blockade earlier this week.

In a post on the brigade’s Facebook page, one of its officers described the unit’s heroic resistance, saying that “for more than a month, the marines have been fighting without replenishing amunition, food and water supplies.” “The wounded accounted for nearly a half of the brigade’s strength, but those who still had their limbs and were capable of walking reported back to duty,” the post said.

Boychenko said that some of the marines managed to join the Azov regiment, while others were captured by the Russians. He didn’t give any numbers.

The Russian military said Thursday that a total of 1,160 Ukrainian marines surrendered this week, a claim that couldn’t be independently verified.

As the Ukrainian troops continue to offer fierce resistance in Mariupol, fears have grown that the exasperated Russians could resort to chemical weapons to deal with the remaining pockets of resistance at the Azovstal plant and other areas of the city.

Eduard Basurin, a Russia-allied separatist official in eastern Ukraine, appeared to call for that Monday, telling Russian state TV that the Russia-backed forces should block all the exits out of the factory and then “use chemical troops to smoke them out of there.” He later said that no chemical weapons were used.

WATCH: What the Biden administration learned from past presidents about military aid in Ukraine

The Azov Regiment claimed Monday, without providing evidence, that a drone had dropped a poisonous substance on its positions but inflicted no serious injuries. A Ukrainian defense official said the attack possibly involved phosphorus munitions.

Ukrainian authorities have said that the Russians have blocked humanitarian convoys from reaching Mariupol, keeping it without food, water and power since the siege started. The Russian troops have turned back buses sent to evacuate residents, but about 150,000 have been able to flee the city in their own vehicles.

Boychenko said that at least 33,500, and, possibly, up to 50,000 Mariupol residents have been taken to “filtration camps” in the separatist-controlled east before being forcibly sent to distant, economically depressed areas in Russia.

Mariupol has seen communications cut since the start of the siege, and as the Russians moved to capture sections of the city they launched radio broadcasts to brainwash the population.

“They unleashed propaganda, telling people that Kyiv and other cities have been captured and they have been abandoned,” Boychenko said.

The continuing fighting in Mariupol has forced the Russian military to keep a significant number of troops in the city, delaying the start of the planned new offensive in eastern Ukraine.

“As long as the street fighting is going on, Russia can’t remove troops from Mariupol and deploy them to other areas, including Donbas,” Oleh Zhdanov, an independent military expert, told the AP.

“The Ukrainian troops in Mariupol are still fulfilling their main task by diverting the Russian forces from other areas. Mariupol remains a major symbol of the Ukrainian resistance.”",https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/mariupol-holds-out-against-russias-siege-a-symbol-of-ukrainian-resistance
4,670d955b-0837-4c1e-93c1-f2b0cd314967,[],,"Russia weapon: The Russia-Ukraine war has been going on for a month.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) on Thursday that Russia has used phosphorous bombs, which killed “adults and children”. As the war in Ukraine is intensifying, Russia has been using more and more dangerous and deadly weapons to achieve success in the assault launched about a month ago. The Ukrainian army is also giving Russians stiff resistance using the weapons provided by the West. Some of these weapons have inflicted serious damage to Russian artillery and tanks.

Here is a look at the weapons used in the Russia-Ukraine War:

Phosphorus bombs

Phosphorus is a substance used by militaries across the world to cause smoke, illumination and incendiary munitions. It burns brightly when exposed to air and produces a large amount of smoke. Phosphorus is used to mark enemy targets and produce a smokescreen to hide troop movements. Zelensky said today that phosphorous used by the Russian military, while igniting, gave serious burns to the targets.

Kinzhal missiles

These are the hypersonic missiles used by Russia I the Ukraine war. Kinzhal, Russian for “dagger”, was launched from the air, most likely by a MiG-31 warplane, according to the BBC. Hypersonic missiles can travel at more than five times the speed of sound, or Mach 5. According to Russia, Kinzhal has a range of 2,000 kilometres. The length of the missile is 8 metres.

9K720 Iskander ballistic missile

These short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs) are leading the Russian attacks in Ukraine. The Iskander has the precision to hit targets 500 kilometres away. These missiles have destroyed homes, hospitals and schools in many Ukraininan cities. The Iskander is a multipurpose tool which comes in various versions - bunker buster, smart submunition, thermobaric and even EMP.

""Vacuum"" bombs

Thermobaric bombs are one of the most brutal war weapons.

Also called thermobaric weapons, these are one of the most brutal war weapons that exist. The bombs are filled with explosive and chemical mix, which causes supersonic blast waves on explosion. These waves can obliterate everything in their path. They are also called vacuum bombs because these explosives suck in the oxygen from the surrounding the air to generate a powerful explosion. Several videos have been posted by Ukrainians, which show Russian thermobaric bombs destroying key structures in cities.

Cluster bombs

Russia was accused of using cluster bombs in an attack on Ukrainian pre-school in which a child was killed. These bombs scatter small bomblets over a wide area, which can result into a significant number of casualties. They can pose a huge risk to civilians present in the area. Human Rights Watch (HRW) and other rights group have claimed that these bombs were used by Russia in the civil war in Syria. Though an international treaty bans the use of these cluster bombs, Russia is not a signatory to it.

War planes

The Russian military has used 75 fixed-wing bomber planes to target Ukrainian airbase and other targets, according to Ukraine's Defence Ministry. These planes are capable of firing air-to-ground missiles or cluster bombs to inflict quick and significant damage to the Ukrainians. Apart from these, there are also reports of the use of Mi-8 choppers.

Javelin missiles

The US-made anti-tank missiles are in high demand in Ukraine. These weapons are giving the numerically inferior Ukrainian army a chance to wreak havoc on their attackers. Javelin has been developed by Lockheed Martin, which said on its website that the missile guides itself to the target after launch (“fire and forget” system), allowing the gunner to take cover and avoid counterfire, or load a new missile.

Bayraktar TB2 drone

Turkish-made Bayaraktar drones have been used extensively by the Ukrainians.

Another weapons used by the Ukrainian military against the Russians. This is a Turkish-made drone that can remain airborne for 27 hours.

Next Generation Light Anti-Tank Weapon (NLAW)

NLAW is very effective in destroying enemy targets at a short distance.

Weighing just 12.5 kilograms, NLAW is a portable, shoulder-launched system that can be used by a single operator. Its armour-piercing warhead can destroy a heavily protected modern battle tank with one shot, and the system is effective at ranges between 20 and 800 metres.

Stinger Surface-to-Air Missile

The Ukrainian military has received the Stinger missile from the US.

Among the biggest reasons why Russia still does not have air superiority over the skies over Ukraine, is this weapon system supplied by the West.

Update: Local officials in Mariupol reported on March 25, 2022, that about 300 people died during the March 16 attack on the theater. Human Rights Watch has not been able to verify the casualty figures. A mother and son who sheltered in the theater for two weeks told Human Rights Watch that hundreds of people were still in the theater when they left at 9 a.m. on March 16, just hours before the attack. Human Rights Watch reviewed two videos posted on Telegram channels on March 25 that appear to be from the aftermath of the explosion. One of them shows women walking down one of the theater’s staircases; some are carrying children. The second video shows extensive damage to the building while the narrator says: “We were on the first floor and weren’t wounded, but there are probably a lot of people under these ruins who were sheltering.”

(Dnipro) – The theater hit by a Russian attack on Mariupol on March 16, 2022 had been sheltering hundreds of civilians, Human Rights Watch said today.

Pavlo Kirilenkoa, the governor of Ukraine’s Donetsk region, announced on March 16 that Russian forces had bombed the Donetsk Regional Theater of Drama, where hundreds of residents were sheltering in the besieged city of Mariupol. Petro Andryushchenko, an assistant to Mariupol’s mayor, told Human Rights Watch that his office did not yet know if any, or how many, civilians had been injured or killed. In satellite imagery of the theater from March 14, the Russian word for “children” clearly appears written twice in large Cyrillic script in front and behind the theater.

“Until we know more, we cannot rule out the possibility of a Ukrainian military target in the area of the theater, but we do know that the theater had been housing at least 500 civilians,” said Belkis Wille, senior crisis and conflict researcher at Human Rights Watch. “This raises serious concerns about what the intended target was in a city where civilians have already been under siege for days and telecommunications, power, water, and heating have been almost completely cut off.”

On March 16, just hours before the attack, Human Rights Watch interviewed over a dozen Mariupol residents who had escaped the city the day before in a convoy of hundreds of private cars and had arrived in Zaporizhzhia. Two people interviewed separately mentioned civilians sheltering in the basement of Mariupol’s theater. One of them, a doctor, said she had visited the theater in the days before she left and that between 500 and 800 civilians were staying there. The other person, who had spent the past two weeks delivering food, water, and medicine to shelters across the city, said that he had delivered aid to the theater multiple times and that it was housing between 500 and 700 civilians.

Human Rights Watch was unable to reach anyone in Mariupol by phone on March 16 to determine whether civilians had left the theater immediately prior to the attack. The doctor, however, shared four photographs of the theater that she said she took on the morning of March 15, on her way out of the city, including one that shows groups of people in civilian clothes cooking food on an open fire and carrying water buckets just outside of the theater. No military vehicles or personnel are visible in the photographs.

Human Rights Watch verified three videos posted on March 16 to a Telegram channel that publishes videos and reports from Mariupol. One of these videos shows the building from a distance with black smoke billowing out of it. Two others, one filmed from within the park where the theater stands, show flames coming from the center of the heavily damaged building. The satellite image with the word “children” shows the theater fully intact on March 14.

The laws of war require parties to the conflict to distinguish at all times between civilian objects and military objectives and each party to the conflict must do everything feasible to verify that targets are military objectives. If there is doubt as to whether an object normally dedicated to civilian purposes, such as a theater, is being used for military purposes, it shall be presumed not to be so. Directing an attack against a civilian object is strictly prohibited, as are indiscriminate attacks and attacks with disproportionate effects on civilians, and may be war crimes.

Organized evacuations of civilians in Mariupol who want to leave should be facilitated, Human Rights Watch said. Parties should allow humanitarian access for neutral and independent providers to support vulnerable civilians who may need assistance to leave, including people with disabilities, older people, pregnant people, children, and people with chronic or severe medical conditions.",https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/03/16/ukraine-mariupol-theater-hit-russian-attack-sheltered-hundreds

Ukrainian officials accused Russia on Wednesday of bombing a theater where hundreds of displaced families have sought refuge in the besieged port city of Mariupol, part of a string of intense attacks that continued even as diplomats said they were making progress in peace talks. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight Video footage showing the smoking ruins of the once-stately Mariupol Drama Theater emerged soon after officials from both Russia and Ukraine expressed cautious optimism about negotiations to end almost three weeks of fighting, and President Volodymyr Zelensky delivered an impassioned virtual address to U.S. lawmakers calling for air support and the creation of a “humanitarian no-fly zone” to protect evacuation corridors.

There was no immediate word on deaths or injuries, though a local official said the fate of “several hundred” people remained unknown.

The strikes in Mariupol and other cities served as a vivid reminder of international concerns about whether Russia would hold to any negotiated truce, and of the immense toll that will be taken as each day passes without a deal. Further cutting against the idea of an imminent end to the war, Russia is deliberating reinforcement of its troops and supplies, the Pentagon said Wednesday, as naval forces bombarded towns outside Odessa, a key port city on the Black Sea. A defense official said the Russians may be softening defenses before invading on the ground.

Ukraine did not announce humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians out of its most vulnerable cities Wednesday because it was not safe to do so, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in her daily briefing — a departure from a precedent set in recent days.

Vereshchuk accused Russian forces of “firing at humanitarian columns of buses” and at “gathering points where the evacuation of peaceful civilians had been planned from, and also taking accompanying people hostage.” According to the latest figures from a U.N. office tracking casualties, 726 civilians have been confirmed killed and 1,174 injured since the fighting began last month — though the actual toll is probably far higher.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told a Russian TV channel that there is “hope for reaching a compromise” in negotiations, echoing comments by Ukrainian officials that the parties were inching closer to a breakthrough. However, both sides stressed that the talks were difficult, with differences remaining over security guarantees for Ukraine and other thorny issues.

U.S. and Western officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, expressed skepticism about the optimistic statements from the Ukrainian delegation about the talks. Some officials said they suspect Zelensky is trying to keep up momentum, even if negotiations are progressing poorly. Others say the Ukrainian leader may not be sharing a full account of closed-door discussions. Many diplomats fear that Moscow is only using the talks to buy time and replenish its forces.

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan spoke with his Russian counterpart, Nikolai Patrushev, on Wednesday, emphasizing that if the Kremlin is serious about diplomacy, it should “stop attacking Ukrainian cities and towns,” the White House said in a statement. The discussion appears to be the highest-level engagement between Moscow and Washington since Russia’s invasion began.

The White House announced $800 million more in security assistance, part of a government spending bill that President Biden signed this week to provide $13.6 billion in new aid to Ukraine. Biden also called Russian President Vladimir Putin a “war criminal” for the first time publicly.

The Kremlin reacted swiftly to Biden’s words. “We consider unacceptable and unforgivable such rhetoric from the head of the country, whose bombs killed hundreds of thousands of people,” said Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov.

Biden is scheduled to travel to Europe next week to join a NATO summit on the Russian invasion. In preparation, NATO defense ministers gathered Wednesday to explore an ambitious new plan for the expansion of the alliance’s forces in Europe, part of a special meeting held in Brussels on how to respond to the threat posed by Russia’s attacks without getting drawn into a wider conflict.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the ministers discussed the long-term deployment of additional troops, warships and planes to the alliance’s eastern flank, which would be funded by major increases in defense spending by NATO member governments. The defense ministers of non-NATO members Finland, Sweden, Georgia and Ukraine notably attended the meeting, underscoring how worried those in proximity to Russia are by the Kremlin’s aggression.

The ministers emphasized arming and funding Ukraine, which would maintain pressure on Russia to make concessions at the negotiating table, Stoltenberg said. But he reiterated that NATO should not deploy forces on the ground or in Ukrainian airspace to prevent a wider war.

“NATO has a responsibility to ensure that this does not escalate beyond Ukraine,” he said.

In the past two days, Ukrainian officials have announced a series of devastating attacks, including a rocket barrage near a botanical garden in southeastern Ukraine and a suspected missile strike on a Kyiv apartment building that led to a frenzied effort to rescue people on the top floors. No deaths were reported in the rocket attack; local officials say at least four people died in the apartment strike in Kyiv, which is under a 36-hour curfew that lifts Thursday.

In Kharkiv, home to 1.4 million people, shelling has destroyed residences, art museums, libraries and government buildings in a city known for its architecture. U.N. agencies and humanitarian groups say even incomplete casualty counts so far show alarming effects on Ukraine’s youngest population: Dozens of children are listed among the dead, and minors make up half of the 3 million Ukrainians who have left the country.

Pope Francis led students in Italy in a prayer Wednesday for children in Ukraine, asking them to think of the “little ones” fleeing bombs and their homes, the Catholic News Service reported.

The strike in Mariupol was particularly horrific.

The Mariupol City Council said in a Telegram post that a Russian plane “dropped a bomb” on the Drama Theater. Videos verified by The Washington Post show extensive damage, as well as flames and plumes of smoke rising up from a large indentation in the middle of the building.

“It is still impossible to estimate the scale of this horrific and inhumane act,” the City Council said, adding that at least the central part of the theater and the entrance were destroyed.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter that Russia must have known that civilians were using the theater as a shelter, calling the incident “another horrific war crime.”

Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the Donetsk regional administration, where Mariupol is located, said in a Facebook post that the fate of the “several hundred” residents is “unknown,” as the entrance to the building is blocked by rubble. Kyrylenko posted images on Facebook, stating that the destruction was caused by a Russian airstrike targeting civilians.

The Russian Defense Ministry denied any involvement. “Russian aviation did not carry out any tasks related to strikes against ground targets in the city of Mariupol,” the ministry said in a statement. Instead, Russian defense officials asserted — without evidence — that “reliable data” showed that militants with the Azov Battalion, a far-right nationalist Ukrainian paramilitary group, “committed a new bloody provocation by blowing up the theater building.”

Vereshchuk, the Ukrainian deputy prime minister, said that in Mariupol, Russian forces also seized an intensive care hospital on Tuesday and took “400 peaceful people” hostage, including medical personnel, and were launching attacks from the hospital. Across the city, conditions are deteriorating amid a Russian blockade, with food and water dwindling and bodies going into mass graves.

Russian forces and equipment remain stalled in many areas, Western officials insisted. About 10 percent of the forces Russia brought into Ukraine are out of the fight, the Pentagon said, including those killed, wounded, captured or missing. Though Russia is deliberating reinforcement of its troops and supplies, the Pentagon has not seen evidence that such reinforcements are moving toward Ukraine, according to a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Biden administration.

“Every day they’re experiencing losses of equipment, of aircraft, of people,” the official said.

Ukrainian air defense forces also continue to prevent Russia’s modern combat aircraft from achieving air superiority, a senior NATO intelligence official said Wednesday, speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by NATO.

“Russian forces are struggling to overcome the challenges posed by Ukraine’s terrain,” the official said, adding that their advance has been slowed by a reluctance to conduct off-road maneuvers and the destruction of bridges by Ukrainian forces.

Nonetheless, the official said, “Putin is unlikely to be deterred, and may instead escalate.”

“He likely remains confident that Russia can militarily defeat Ukraine,” the official said, adding that it was unclear whether Putin will pursue “a maximalist plan” to capture all or most of the country.

Twenty-one people were killed and 25 wounded Thursday after rockets slammed into the western Ukraine town of Merefa as Russia's bloody, struggling invasion dragged into its fourth week.

Merefa Mayor Veniamin Sitov said the assault destroyed a school and community center. Ten survivors were critically wounded, the local prosecutor’s office reported.

Later Thursday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken became the second high-level U.S. official in two days to accuse Russia of war crimes.

Merefa, a town of 20,000 people, is about 20 miles south of Kharkiv and has been victimized by its proximity to the sprawling regional jewel that Russia's military pounding has failed to vanquish.

Kharkiv has become one of the saddest stories of the war, a city of museums and universities that 1.4 million people call home. Now it is slowly but deliberately being torn apart as Russia's apparently stalled military pounds away at whatever targets its missiles can reach.

Similar storylines were unfolding across much of the country. In the battered southern port city of Mariupol, rescue efforts were underway Thursday following Russian airstrikes that ripped apart a theater. The building, serving as a makeshift shelter for hundreds of women and children, was bombed late Wednesday even though the word ""CHILDREN"" in Russian was laid out in giant letters in front and behind it.

“The building withstood the impact of a high-powered air bomb and protected the lives of people hiding in the bomb shelter,"" Ukraine’s ombudswoman Ludmyla Denisova said Thursday. Ukrainian parliament member Sergiy Taruta added on a social media post that ""people are coming out alive.""

The Kyiv Independent reported at least 130 survivors had been pulled from the wreckage. The rescue efforts were continuing.

“Our hearts are broken by what Russia is doing to our people, to our Mariupol,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.

REDUCED TO RUBBLE:Heartbreaking images explore Ukraine's devastated residential areas

Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for Russia’s Foreign Ministry, denied the bombing and said the military ""does not bomb cities.""

But Vadim Denisenko, an adviser to the Ukraine minister of Internal Affairs, said 90% of Mariupol has been destroyed or damaged and that almost no buildings have been left untouched. Most of the 400,000 residents remain in the city, he said.

""Evacuation and rescue efforts remain extremely difficult due to constant Russian shelling,"" Denisenko said. ""This is beyond a humanitarian disaster.""

Blinken: 'There will be accountability for any war crimes'

Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday that he agrees with President Joe Biden that war crimes have been committed in Ukraine.

“Intentionally targeting civilians is a war crime,” he said at a White House news briefing. “I find it difficult to conclude that the Russians are doing otherwise.”

Blinken’s comments came a day after Biden called Russian President Vladimir Putin a “war criminal.” On Thursday, Biden called Putin ""a murderous dictator, a pure thug who is waging an immoral war against the people of Ukraine.""

Describing the recent attack on Ukrainians waiting in bread lines and the bombing of a theater where children were sheltered, Blinken said the U.S. is helping document potential war crimes for prosecution.

Asked what should happen to Putin if he’s found guilty, Blinken said he won’t get ahead of the investigation, but he promised there will be consequences.

“I can say with conviction that there will be accountability for any war crimes that are determined to have occurred,” he said.

Blinken pushed the Senate to confirm nominees who can help respond to the events in Ukraine, including a position important for refugees and a coordinator for sanctions policy.

Asked about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Blinken said he sees no signs that Putin is prepared to stop.

American killed in Chernihiv seeking medical care for partner

Secretary of State Antony Blinken reported Thursday the death of an American in the war but did not identify the person. The victim's sister provided details in a Facebook post.

“My brother Jimmy Hill was killed yesterday in Chernihiv, Ukraine. He was waiting in a bread line with several other people when they were gunned down” by Russian military forces, wrote his sister, Cheryl Hill Gordon. “His body was found in the street by the local police.”

Ukrainian officials had previously said 10 people in a bread line were killed Wednesday in Chernihiv, a city of 285,000 people in the northern part of the country. Hill was the second U.S. citizen known to die in the war, after the killing of journalist and filmmaker Brent Renaud last week.

Hill, a Minnesota native believed to be 67, identified himself in a Facebook post as a lecturer at universities in Kyiv and Warsaw, Poland, and said he was in Chernihiv with his partner seeking medical treatment for her.

“Nobody in Chernihiv is safe. Indiscriminate bombing,'' he wrote March 2, less than a week into the war. ""Ukrainian forces hold city but are surrounded. It’s a siege here. Nobody in. Nobody out.”

WHO confirms 43 attacks on health care facilities

Among the most condemned attacks of the Russian invasion was last week's airstrike on a maternity hospital in Mariupol that killed three people and left 17 injured.

The World Health Organization says that's just one of 43 confirmed attacks on hospitals and health care facilities by Russian forces since the war began. Those aggressions have killed 12 and injured 34.

“The life-saving medicine we need right now is peace,” WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the United Nations Security Council in a virtual briefing.

Russian ground advance remains stalled: They 'weren’t ready for pushback'

Russia continues struggling to feed, supply and rearm the troops it sent to invade Ukraine, according to a senior Defense Department official.

Poor planning and stiff resistance from Ukrainians has basically frozen the Russian advance three weeks after their invasion, the official said Thursday on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence assessments.

The official termed the Russian military situation in Ukraine “extraordinary,” noting that commanders are discussing how to resupply and reinforce the more than 150,000 troops that began amassing on Ukraine’s border in the fall.

The stalled invasion indicates the Russians didn’t properly plan for the war, lack good logistics and are facing stiffer resistance than expected, the official said. They “weren’t ready for pushback.”

Anecdotal indications show flagging morale among some Russian troops, the official said, attributing the morale issue to poor leadership, lack of communication with troops and disillusionment from fierce Ukrainian resistance.

Ukrainian fighters have stalled Russia’s advance about 10 miles from Kyiv’s city center, the official said. Russia appears to be moving artillery units closer to that front line, where they are expected to shell the city and try to wear it down, the official said.

Part of the latest military aid package approved by President Joe Biden will aid Ukrainians in attacking Russian forces attempting to besiege Kyiv, the official said. The shipments will include tactical drones.

China should wield its influence on Russia for the better, Blinken says

China has a particular responsibility to use its influence on Russia, Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters the day before President Joe Biden is scheduled to talk with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

But rather than defending the international rules it professes to support, Blinken said, China is instead moving in the opposite direction by refusing to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine while portraying itself as a neutral arbiter.

The U.S. is also concerned that China is considering directly assisting Russia with military equipment, something both China and Russia have denied.

During Friday’s call, Blinken said, Biden will make clear to Xi that China will bear responsibility for any actions it takes to support Russia's aggression.

“And,” he said, “we will not hesitate to impose costs.”

Baltic nations warn they could be next

The three leaders of legislative foreign affairs committees in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania warned U.S. lawmakers Thursday that Russia would remain a worldwide threat for years and could attack their Baltic region after Ukraine. The foreign lawmakers told the Helsinki Commission, made up of U.S. lawmakers and executive branch officials, that the Baltic countries haven’t been attacked yet because they belong to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which the U.S. and Europe have pledged to defend. But the lawmakers urged the U.S. to provide more troops, ground-based anti-aircraft weapons and fighter jets to protect them from neighboring Russia.

“We are not peripheral, we are the frontier where democracy for the entire Western world has to stand or fall,” Latvian lawmaker Rihards Kols said. “This will be a marathon, not a sprint.""

Schwarzenegger posts video urging Putin, Russians to end violence

Arnold Schwarzenegger urged Russia's government, military and citizens to end the war in a nine-minute video shared Thursday to social media. The former governor of California shared his appreciation of the Russian people and aimed to dispel misinformation to Russian citizens and military members by sharing ""the truth"" of why Russia invaded Ukraine.

Schwarzenegger shot down claims from the Russian government that the purpose of their invasion was to ""denazify Ukraine"" and shared heartbreaking images and video of buildings that had been bombed.

""To the soldiers who are listening to this, remember that 11 million Russians have family connections to Ukraine,"" he said. ""So every bullet you shoot, you shoot a brother or a sister. … And to President Putin, I say: You started this war. You are leading this war. You can stop this war.""

DHS chief Mayorkas says Russian cyberattacks on US haven't increased during war

Alejandro Mayorkas, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said Thursday the agency hasn’t detected additional Russian cyberattacks on critical infrastructure in the U.S. after the invasion of Ukraine, but has educated local officials and private businesses about how to protect against potential attacks.

“We have not seen an attack on the homeland that is tied to the Russian invasion of Ukraine,” Mayorkas told reporters during an online news conference, although Russian cyber attacks have been confirmed against Ukraine and other countries. “We continue of course to see cyber activity in the United States, independent of that.”

The department saw a 300% increase in ransomware incidents last year compared with a year earlier, for a combined $300 million in losses.

To educate local officials and private businesses, the department created a web site called Shields Up to distribute information about how to prevent the threat. Some of the advice includes using simple methods such as backing up files, changing passwords often and setting up multi-factor authentication.

Interest is high. The department has held 80 virtual meetings on the subject and one featured 9,000 participants, Mayorkas said.

“We provide tactics and techniques that Russian cyber actors have used in the past, so that people can patch any vulnerabilities, strengthen their defenses and be ready,” Mayorkas said.

The secretary also said DHS has reminded Border Patrol agents that Ukrainian refugees from the war arriving in the U.S. could receive an exception to health restrictions that might otherwise bar their entry into the country.

WNBA star Brittney Griner to remain in Russian custody until May 19

WNBA star Brittney Griner, detained at a Moscow airport last month, will be held until at least May 19, the Russian state news agency Tass reported. Griner was detained after Russian authorities said a search of her luggage revealed vape cartridges. They were identified as containing oil derived from cannabis, which could carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison in Russia.

“The court granted the request of the investigation and extended the period of detention of the U.S. citizen Griner until May 19,” the court said.

The two-time Olympic gold medalist, 31, has played basketball in Russia for the last seven years in the winter, earning over $1 million per season – more than four times her WNBA salary. The WNBA season opens May 6.

Ukrainian men steel for battle as they say goodbye to families

LVIV, Ukraine – As millions of Ukrainian women and children move west to escape Russia's widening war in their country, a largely unspoken frontline – open-ended, full of searing psychological hurt – continues to expand across Ukraine: the men they leave behind.

Many of the women USA TODAY spoke to were too overcome with emotion to address the subject of leaving their husbands behind, but many Ukrainian men showed remarkable stoicism in talking about the pain of family separations that have no foreseeable end. They feel it is their duty to defend their country.

""My family understands that if we don't win this fight, future generations – maybe even the whole world – will not have a good life,"" said Igor Kotz, 37, a property developer turned amateur security chief for a Lviv-based humanitarian aid center that helps supply Ukraine's professional and civilian armed forces. His wife and children fled to Poland while he stayed to fight, and Kotz said, ""I have accepted that I may not ever see my wife and kids again."" Read more here.

8,670d955b-0837-4c1e-93c1-f2b0cd314967,['Jamie Dettmer'],,"Russian warships bombarded targets near Odesa Wednesday morning, possibly as a part of a buildup to an attack on the Ukrainian port city. But some military strategists say Russian forces are struggling to hold territory they have seized and have suffered some serious reversals in fierce skirmishes elsewhere that will likely delay an assault on Odesa.

Britain’s Defense Ministry in its daily update on the state of battle assessed that Russian forces are struggling to overcome challenges posed by Ukraine's terrain and that Russian units have remained largely tied to Ukraine’s roads, demonstrating reluctance to go off-road to maneuver. It said Ukrainian forces have also managed to stall Russian advances by blowing up bridges.

“The tactics of the Ukrainian Armed Forces have adeptly exploited Russia’s lack of maneuver, frustrating the Russian advance and inflicting heavy losses on the invading forces,” the British Defense Ministry concluded.

Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said Wednesday in a tweet that a series of counter offensives in “several operational areas” had altered the warring “parties' dispositions.” And Oleksiy Arestovych, another aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said small-scale Ukrainian counterattacks meant Russian forces have not managed to clear the “main hotspots” around Kyiv and there is little chance they will as “Russia has used up its resources.”

Two-thirds of Russian rockets are striking civilian buildings and infrastructure, Arestovych said in a video briefing.

Ukrainian authorities said Russian forces continued intense bombardment of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, and surrounding towns. A high-rise apartment block was hit in the latest shelling attack on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, Wednesday, smashing the top floor and igniting a blaze. There were reports of two victims, but there has been no confirmation on whether they were killed or injured. So far, Ukrainian authorities estimate Russia has destroyed 3,500 buildings in 21 days of war, including more than 200 schools.

Ukraine’s military claims 13,800 Russian soldiers have been killed or captured since the start of the Russian invasion on February 24. They also say they have destroyed or taken out of action 430 tanks and 1,375 armored vehicles. The Ukrainian claims have not been independently verified.

A fourth Russian general, Oleg Mityaev, the 47-year-old commander of Russia's 150th motorized rifle division, was reportedly killed. Kyiv said Mityaev, who fought in Syria, died near the city of Mariupol and released a photo purportedly of his body.

Moscow has not confirmed the death.

If the claim is accurate, he would be the fourth Russian general to have been killed and 13th officer since February 24, when the invasion of Ukraine began.

The other generals killed were: Major General Andrei Kolesnikov, commander of the 29th Combined Army; Major General Vitaly Gerasimov, a deputy commander of Russia's 41st army, another combat veteran who fought in Syria, and Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky, who was reportedly killed by a sniper. Four Russian colonels have also been killed and a Chechen general, Magomed Tushaev, has been reported by Kyiv as killed in an ambush near Hostomel, near the Ukrainian capital, which has seen some of the heaviest ground fighting since Russia invaded.

Military analysts suggest the high death tally of senior officers is because they have had to move closer to the front lines to sort out logistical supply problems and to coax ground troops forward. Moscow has only acknowledged that 498 of its soldiers have been killed and 1,597 wounded, and that was on March 2 with no updates since.

Western defense officials have lower estimates than Ukraine’s for the Russian death toll, with a consensus of a likely 6,000 Russian dead, around the number of U.S. service personnel killed in Afghanistan and Iraq during two decades of fighting.

Russian military spokesmen have a different view of the state of battle, saying its forces shot down in the past 24 hours two Ukrainian Su-25 warplanes and one MiG-29 fighter jet as well as four drones. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov also said Wednesday that Russian forces destroyed 128 Ukrainian military facilities the past day.

Independent military observers and strategists concur with the assessment of Britain’s Defense Ministry, saying that the outgunned and outmanned Ukrainian defense forces have managed to frustrate Russia’s invasion force, especially in northern and eastern Ukraine.

“Putin has check-mated himself: his armor-mechanized forces cannot enter Kiev [sic] without suffering huge casualties, and neither can they stay outside without being attacked by drones and AT [anti-tank] missiles,” tweeted Edward Luttwak, a renowned American military strategist.

In south Ukraine, Russian forces have made more progress but have not been able to subjugate the smaller port-town of Mariupol, which has been besieged and without water, food supplies and electricity for days. And a Russian advance on Odesa has also been stalled because of a dogged Ukrainian defense of the town of Mykolayiv, 120 kilometers east of Odesa, where Ukrainian defenders managed to recapture the local airport a few days ago.

Ukrainian and Western military officials say they still think Russia is planning an assault on Odesa, and Russian warships have been gathering off the coast nearby, they say. One option for the Russians would be to bypass Mykolayiv and conduct an amphibious landing.

Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, said last week that a seaborne assault on Odesa had been planned but was abandoned because of poor weather conditions. Odesa has been preparing for a Russian attack, fortifying streets for close fighting and mining beaches.",https://www.voanews.com/a/ukrainian-counterattacks-compound-russia-military-problem/6488338.html

The immediate toll of the Russian airstrike that devastated a maternity hospital in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol last week was three people dead and 17 injured, but the impact did not stop there. In the AP photo that has come to symbolize the attack, a wounded pregnant woman lies on a stretcher, holding her lower belly and splattered with blood, being rushed out of the hospital by emergency workers seeking care for her elsewhere. Neither she nor her baby survived.

The attack was condemned worldwide. The World Health Organization issued a statement: ""To attack the most vulnerable – babies, children, pregnant women, and those already suffering from illness and disease, and health workers risking their own lives to save lives – is an act of unconscionable cruelty.""

WHO further pointed to the ongoing ripple effects such attacks pose by — limiting access to health care as well as potentially endangering those who seek it and also straining and threatening the viability of the health-care system itself.

Yet this was only one of 31 attacks on health-care workers, medical sites and facilities documented thus far in the Ukraine conflict by WHO's Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care (SSA). Moreover, health facilities have been targeted in other wars, including those led or supported by Russia, like Syria's ongoing civil war and the war in Chechen from 1999 to 2009.

What happens to the health needs of the local population in the short-term – and what are the long-term consequences of this kind of destruction? How can what happened in past conflicts help us gain insight into the plight of those in Ukraine now?

To learn more, we spoke with Leonard Rubenstein, professor at the Johns Hopkins University school of public health and author of Perilous Medicine: The Struggle to Protect Health Care from the Violence of War; Dr. Michele Heisler, medical director at Physicians for Human Rights and a professor of internal medicine and of public health at the University of Michigan; and Dr. Houssam al-Nahhas, the Middle East and North Africa researcher at Physicians for Human Rights. Their comments have been edited for length and clarity.

Physicians for Human Rights has documented 601 deliberate attacks on 350 medical facilities in Syria from 2011 onward. Why target medical facilities?

Heisler: It is a devastatingly effective weapon of war because there are few greater ways of terrorizing the population, of breaking their will and lowering morale, than through attacking health care. An article in The Lancet called this strategy ""the weaponization of health care.""

Al-Nahhas: When a country attacks health-care facilities they are sending the message that they don't have any boundaries to what they can do. This is targeting people who cannot defend themselves and who cannot pose a threat because they're patients. It is a way to break people's resilience. Going to the hospital becomes dangerous, going there to get help means risking your life.

toggle caption SANA via AP

Was that one of the immediate consequences you saw in Syria and elsewhere?

Al-Nahhas: We documented this in a case history of what happened after three airstrikes hit al-Altareb hospital in Aleppo in March 2021. Afterward, there was a significant decrease in consultations and beneficiaries of health care due to the risk of being bombed at the facility.

There was a decrease of 78% of prenatal and reproductive care consultations. We also witnessed a 27% decrease in normal deliveries. Many would elect to do a C-section in order to know when they will come in and when they will go out and to limit the time spent in the facility.

That is also what I witnessed in Aleppo during my time there as an emergency physician between 2014 and 2016, when we saw a spike of C-sections in conjunction with military escalations in 2014.

What else happens when health-care facilities are attacked?

Heisler: In the short-term there is chaos. Supplies, medications, oxygen are in short supply. People are not getting IV fluids or necessary surgery or other treatments, such as dialysis, and there are needless deaths as a result.

Rubenstein: On top of that, the hospitals may not have a track record of dealing with the complex injuries resulting from these powerful weapons. There may also be fewer staff members. In Syria, many of the most experienced physicians left, leaving behind the less experienced and younger physicians. There was an effort at quick training and a shifting of inexperienced people doing more complex things. For instance, technicians who supported the anesthesiologists may have to do the anesthesia or dentists [may have to] do oral surgery.

Are there additional ramifications for health care as the conflict continues?

Rubenstein: Childhood vaccinations tend to decline because the vaccinators are attacked — as in Afghanistan — and whole vaccine initiatives have to be suspended. Measles vaccinations have to be suspended either because of attacks on the vaccinators or because of the general insecurity, where it's too dangerous to go house to house. Attacks on a health-care facility in Zemio in Central African Republic [in 2017] led to HIV and AIDS programs being suspended.

In Yemen the Saudis have bombed both hospitals and water and sanitation infrastructure, such as pumping plants, which then led to a cholera epidemic that affected more than 2 million people.

Heisler: In Syria, hospitals went underground. You go from flying the white flag and when you realize that might indeed be a target, you take down the flag and you go underground. In Syria there was a whole system of underground hospitals.

Al-Nahhas: If all the intensive care units are occupied by people with war injuries, that equipment is not available to be used to help COVID patients or heart patients or any non-war related illness.

And what longer term consequences have you seen from such attacks?

Rubenstein: Even after a conflict ends it often takes a very long time to restore health capacity. And in the meantime people's health continues to suffer in ways similar to during the conflict.

Heisler: The concern is this might lead to the complete collapse of the health-care system. The continuing shortage of health-care workers and no supplies and no system to provide necessary care — that is devastating. In Yemen, and in Tigray [Ethiopia, where a war began in 2020 and is still going on] almost all health-care systems are not functioning.

Enlarge this image toggle caption EDUARDO SOTERAS/Eduardo Soteras/AFP via Getty Images EDUARDO SOTERAS/Eduardo Soteras/AFP via Getty Images

What about the impact on the physicians and health-care workers? The stress must be acute.

Al-Nahhas: I think it's important for people to know what the health-care workers are experiencing in Ukraine — especially when health care is not protected in conflict.

It's knowing that you are in a hospital and treating patients and yet you can be targeted and killed at any moment. You need to provide the best care for your patients but you're also worried about your own safety.

I was in Syria for two years literally living in the hospital. It was rewarding to see the impact of [our] the work on people, but it was not sustainable because of the stress on all the health-care providers. We were not used to seeing so much trauma. We had to learn as we went along how to treat war-related injuries that we had never seen before.

This sense of how bad things can get — the flashbacks from Syria — are still with me after eight years.

What is being done to stop such attacks? Three international courts are now investigating possible war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine. Could that make a difference?

Heisler: We need to establish accountability by documenting and gathering evidence of what has happened. That is the role of organizations like ours. If we live in a world in which you can bomb hospitals in war, killing patients and health-care workers, then we really would be returning to no-holds barred wars where no one is safe. We have to be sure that this does not continue.
