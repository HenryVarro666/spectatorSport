Russian assets to be frozen

BRUSSELS, Feb 24 (Reuters) - European Union leaders agreed on Thursday to impose new economic sanctions on Russia, joining the United States and Britain in trying to punish President Vladimir Putin and his allies for unleashing a full-scale attack on Ukraine.

However, the bloc held back from taking the harshest measures sought by Ukraine and split over just how far to take the sanctions, leaving details to be worked out in the coming days.

Leaders of the 27-nation bloc lambasted Putin at an emergency summit in Brussels, with Latvian Prime Minister Krisjanis Karins describing him as ""a deluded autocrat creating misery for millions"".

The EU will freeze Russian assets in the bloc and halt its banks' access to European financial markets as part of what EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell described as ""the harshest package of sanctions we have ever implemented"".

The sanctions will also target Russia's energy and transport sectors among others, and seek to stifle its trade and manufacturing with export controls.

""Our sanctions will hurt the Russian economy in its heart,"" said Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo.

But a sense of powerlessness was tangible after Western failed to to stop a war that they leaders had seen coming.

""We were not successful enough, not decisive enough, to prevent Russia from this step, which is a tragedy for Ukraine, a tragedy for Europe and a tragedy for Russia itself,"" said Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda.

There are differences within the EU over how far to go with sanctions, with countries that would face the biggest economic backlash keen to keep the most severe steps in reserve.

""Hopefully, we will make big strides tomorrow on how these sanctions will look specifically,"" said Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra. ""For the Netherlands, SWIFT is part of the discussion.""

'MASSIVE AND SEVERE CONSEQUENCES'

An EU diplomat said the bloc, like the United States, would stop short of taking steps to cut Russia off from the SWIFT global interbank payments system. read more

Ukraine and the EU's ex-Soviet Baltic states had been pushing to remove Russia from the system. But asked about SWIFT, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said: ""We need to keep sanctions ready for later times.""

Germany has already put approval of the Russian-owned Nord Stream 2 Baltic gas pipeline on ice.

In a statement agreed at the summit, EU leaders said the new round of sanctions ""will impose massive and severe consequences on Russia for its action, in close coordination with our partners and allies"".

Russian assets in the EU would be frozen and Russian banks' access to Europe's financial markets would be blocked.

An EU diplomat said Italy, Germany and Cyprus were among those that preferred a step-by-step approach, while central European and Baltic states - those closest to Russia - wanted a harder stance.

""Russia needs to feel that the price of aggression is significant,"" said Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa, wearing a tie with the Ukrainian flag's yellow and blue colours.

The EU had already approved a first round of sanctions on Wednesday, including blacklisting Russian politicians and curbing trade between the EU and two breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine whose independence Moscow has recognised. read more

The EU will also prepare a new aid package for Ukraine and new sanctions against Belarus, used by some of the Russian invaders to enter Ukraine.

Separately, the bloc also promised support to Moldova, another ex-Soviet republic where a pro-Western government is at odds with its former overlord Moscow.

""If he (Putin) can attack Ukraine, it could be any other European country. The democratic ideas, if they were to get to Russia, they would overturn his government. He is fighting for power,"" said Latvia's Karins.

ECB to deliver analysis on impact of cutting Russia off SWIFT

BRUSSELS, Feb 25 (Reuters) - EU states agreed to freeze any European assets of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his foreign minister on Friday, as Ukraine's leader pleaded for faster and more forceful sanctions to punish Russia's invasion of his country.

The move against Putin and his top diplomat, Sergei Lavrov, came as envoys of the EU's 27 member states agreed on a new wave of measures - their second this week - to hit Russia's elite and thwart operations of 70% of the country's banking system.

""We are now listing President Putin and Foreign Minister Lavrov as well,"" German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said as she joined her EU counterparts to agree on the new sanctions.

""They are responsible for the deaths of innocent people in Ukraine, and for trampling on the international system. We, as Europeans, do not accept that.""

A senior EU diplomat said that although the Russian leaders may not have extensive assets in Europe, the move against them personally was ""a politically important signal"".

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Putin now joins only two other world leaders sanctioned by the bloc: Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus.

Borrell said the latest round of sanctions could be followed by a third, though this would only come if it was needed.

Earlier on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged Europe to act more quickly and forcefully in imposing sanctions on Moscow, accusing western allies of politicking as Moscow's forces advanced on Kyiv.

""You still can stop this aggression. You have to act swiftly,"" he said, adding that banning Russians from entering the EU, cutting Moscow off from the SWIFT global interbank payments system and an oil embargo should all be on the table.

The EU ministers' agreement on comprehensive sanctions means the bloc has joined the United States and other Western nations in curbing Russia's access to key technologies and financing.

The EU's measures will also target Russian elites and make it tougher for diplomats to travel, but the bloc opted not to curb Russian energy imports, or - after objections from Germany and Italy, among others - to cut Russia off from SWIFT.

French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, hosting a meeting of EU counterparts in Paris to discuss the economic impact, said removing Russia from SWIFT remained an option, but only as a ""financial nuclear weapon"" of last resort. read more

He said some EU countries - but not France - have reservations about such a step, and the European Central Bank was expected to deliver an analysis ""in the coming hours"" on the consequences if it was taken.

Baerbock said the SWIFT option risked hurting individuals, such as those trying to send money to relatives in Russia, ""whereas those people who are responsible for the bloodshed will still be able to do their bank business"".

Europe’s reserves stand at just 30 percent, and Europeans are already paying exorbitant prices for energy.

The conflict is occurring when supplies of both oil and natural gas have been tight for months, driving up prices.

“There are serious concerns” that Moscow will tighten exports further and send prices higher, said Helima Croft, head of commodities at RBC Capital Markets, an investment bank.

Germany, Russia’s largest trading partner in Europe, gets 55 percent of its supply from Russia. Italy, the second-biggest trading partner, gets 41 percent. At a forum in Milan last week, the Russian ambassador Sergey Razov said President Vladimir V. Putin had told the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, that “if Italy needs more gas we are ready to supply it.”

Mr. Putin also made a point of saying that roughly 500 Italian businesses have operations in Russia and that bilateral investments are worth $8 billion.

Austria, Turkey and France are large consumers of Russian natural gas.

The European Union will block Russia’s access to critical technology and other markets as punishment for Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, European President Ursula von der Leyen said Thursday.

Von der Leyen made a brief public appearance to announce the new measures just hours after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, sending troops across the border from several directions and bombing targets across the country.

Innocent people, von der Leyen said, “are dying of fear for their lives.”

She vowed the EU would respond forcefully.

“We will target the strategic sectors of the Russian economy by blocking the access to technologies and markets that are key for Russia,” von der Leyen said, reading from a prepared statement. “We will freeze Russian assets in the European Union and stop the access of Russian banks to European financial markets.”

“These sanctions,” she added, “are designed to take a heavy toll on the Kremlin’s interests and their ability to finance war.”

The Commission presented a draft package of measures to ambassadors from EU countries on Thursday morning, according to three diplomats. The package includes export controls on technology — including technology with links to the oil and transport sector — and further sanctions on banks, other entities and individuals, the diplomats said.

However, the package does not include kicking Russia out of the SWIFT international payments system, according to diplomats. Baltic countries have called for such a step but Germany and Italy have been far more hesitant.

“SWIFT is not there for now, it needs a political decision. It’s for leaders to decide,” said one of the diplomats.

Standing next to von der Leyen, top EU diplomat Josep Borrell promised the penalties would constitute “the harshest package of sanctions we have ever implemented.”

The new penalties will be presented Thursday evening at an emergency summit of EU leaders.

“We will weaken Russia’s economic base and its capacity to modernize,” von der Leyen said.

The punishment will build on an initial raft of penalties the EU approved Wednesday in response to Russia’s initial troop deployment into eastern Ukraine’s contested Donbass region. European Council President Charles Michel called the emergency EU leaders’ summit following that decision.

“Russia’s target is not only Donbass, the target is not only Ukraine,” von der Leyen said. “The target is the stability in Europe. And the whole of the international peace order.”

The first round of EU penalties went after several members of Putin’s inner circle, including his defense minister. It also targeted military commanders, prominent media personalities who trumpet Kremlin talking points, banking executives and state-controlled financial institutions.

The penalties overlapped with others imposed by the U.S. and U.K., while going father in some areas.

But the EU and its allies have yet to go after a number of more damaging targets, such as Russia’s lucrative energy sector, or its import of key technologies like semiconductors. Also not yet targeted for sanctions is Putin himself.

“These are among the darkest hours for Europe since the end of World War II,” Borrell said.

EU leaders have agreed to impose ""massive"" sanctions on Russia in areas ranging from finance to transport, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in the early hours of Friday.

Speaking following an emergency summit dedicated to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, von der Leyen declared that ""we will hold the Kremlin accountable.""

""The package of massive and targeted sanctions European leaders approved tonight clearly demonstrates that — it will have maximum impact on the Russian economy and the political elite,"" she said.

The new sanctions will hit five areas: the financial sector, the energy sector, the transport sector, export controls and visa policy, according to the Commission chief.

""This package includes financial sanctions that cut Russia's access to the most important capital markets. We're now targeting 70 percent of the Russian banking market, but also key state-owned companies including the field of defense,"" she said.

The sanctions will increase Russia's borrowing costs and gradually erode its industrial base, according to von der Leyen, who also said Russia's elites will be hit.

When it comes to energy, ""our export ban will hit the oil by making it impossible for Russia to upgrade its oil refineries.""

There will also be a ban on the sale of aircraft, spare parts and equipment to Russian airlines, and limit Russia's access to crucial technologies needed to build semiconductors and other advanced technologies, officials said.

And when it comes to visas, ""diplomats and related groups and business people will no longer have privileged access to the European Union,"" she said.

""Our unity is our strength,"" von der Leyen said. ""The Kremlin knows this and it has tried its best to divide us, but it has utterly failed. It has achieved exactly the opposite,” she said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Commission president said, ""is trying to subjugate a friendly European country and he's trying to redraw the maps of Europe by force. He must — and he will — fail.""

The EU statement said the sanctions cover:

the financial sector,

the energy and transport sectors,

dual-use goods as well as export controls and export financing,

visa policy,

additional sanctions against Russian individuals.

However, both the EU and US decided for the time being not to cut Russia off from the SWIFT global interbank payments system, as demanded by Ukraine.

What EU leaders said about the sanctions

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the sanctions would target 70% of the Russian banking market and key state owned companies, including in defense.

The export ban would ""hit the oil sector by making it impossible for Russia to upgrade its refineries,"" von der Leyen said. The EU was also banning the sale of aircrafts and equipment to Russian airlines, she added.

The visa restrictions will see diplomats and business people no longer having privileged access to the European Union.

European Council President Charles Michel said the measures would have ""massive and severe consequences"" for Russia in response to the ""unprovoked and unjustified military aggression against Ukraine.""

The sanctions, which come after Russia invaded Ukraine Thursday morning, had been billed by the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borell as ""one of the harshest packages of sanctions we have ever implemented.""

The EU approved a first round of sanctionsafter Russia recognized two separatist breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine on Tuesday. Those sanctions, which went into effect Wednesday, mainly took aim at Russian banks and lawmakers.

Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo told reporters upon his arrival at the summit that he was open for discussion on the topic, while German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said it was important to agree ""to those measures that have been prepared — and keep everything else for a situation where it may be necessary to go beyond that.""

How the EU reacted to Russia's invasion of Ukraine

Russia's attack Thursday drew widespread condemnation from Western powers, as social media videos emerged of people lining up at gas stations or grocery stores in several Ukrainian cities, with people faced with the decision of either staying put at their homes or fleeing the country.

European Commission President von der Leyen condemned the attack in the morning, calling it ""barbaric"" and accusing Russia's Putin of bringing ""war back to Europe.""

""With this package, we will target the strategic sectors of the Russian economy by blocking their access to technologies and markets that are key to Russia,"" von der Leyen said.

Sanctions would aim at weakening Russian economy and its ""capacity to modernize,"" she said.

""Sanctions would also freeze Russian assets in Europe and block Moscow's access to European financial markets,"" von der Leyen added.

Lithuania's President Gitanas Nauseda, who declared a state of emergency for two weeks hours after Russian attack on Ukraine, said EU member states would also discuss offering EU candidate status to Ukraine, a measure Kyiv has long sought.

Josep Borrell said he had summoned the Russian ambassador to the EU, Vladimir Chizhov, in Brussels. The EU has demanded that Putin immediately withdrew troops from Ukrainian territory, EU foreign affairs spokesperson Peter Stano said in a statement released earlier in the day.

National security aides had already been huddling in the West Wing on Wednesday evening, preparing for what US officials had warned was a looming assault on Ukraine, when Putin's speech began airing on Russian television around 9:45 p.m. ET.

Appearing before dawn in Russia, the speech came as a surprise.

At the United Nations, Ambassador Linda Thomas Greenfield had spoken by phone to Biden in the moments prior to her remarks at an emergency session of the Security Council. He asked her “to convey in the strongest possible terms his -- and our -- steadfast support for Ukraine,"" she said around 9:45 p.m. ET -- almost exactly the same time as Putin's address.

Her speech didn't reflect the major development that Putin had officially announced the invasion. Photos from the room show her texting with the Ukrainian delegate, saying she ""wished I had the news before I ended my remarks.""

At the White House, Biden convened a secure phone call with top military brass Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan.

Just past 10 p.m. ET, activity in the West Wing briefly came to a halt as televisions tuned to CNN showed teams reporting hearing explosions in Kyiv and Kharkiv, hurriedly donning their protective gear and helmets.

In their offices, Sullivan and other aides worked on drafting Biden's initial statement declaring Russia's actions ""unprovoked and unjustified"" and vowing ""the world will hold Russia accountable."" Biden's statement came through at 10:25 p.m. ET.

Roughly an hour later, a request came in from Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky to speak with Biden, who was eager to get him on the phone. Earlier in the day, officials took note of Zelensky's public concerns, including declaring a state of emergency and mobilizing military reservists, believing it was first time he had conveyed publicly the concerns they have discussed privately for weeks.

On their call, which lasted approximately 10 minutes, Zelensky asked Biden to ""call on the leaders of the world to speak out clearly against President Putin's flagrant aggression, and to stand with the people of Ukraine.""

As Biden was speaking to Zelensky, his aides were also on the phone to Europe as they prepared to announce what one official described as the ""full scale"" of sanctions, which could include export controls, restrictions on large banks and blocks on members of Putin's inner circle.

Biden starts Thursday with additional briefings before attending a virtual session of the G7, where the sanctions will be discussed among the world's leading industrialized nations.

And at noon, Biden will speak to the American people from the White House.
