“Sony Interactive Entertainment joins the global community in calling for peace in Ukraine,” says a statement posted on PlayStation’s Twitter account.

“We have suspended all software and hardware shipments, the launch of Gran Turismo 7, and operations of the PlayStation Store in Russia.”

The statement adds that Japanese tech and entertainment giant Sony Group is donating $2 million to the UN refugee agency and Save the Children “to support the victims of this tragedy.”

A growing number of multinationals, from McDonald’s to Adidas and Samsung, have fully or partially halted business in Russia after its invasion of its neighboring country two weeks ago.

The latest: Mariupol's City Council said in a Telegram post on Thursday that a young girl was among three people confirmed killed in the attack, which wounded at least 17 others.

Of note: Zelensky wrote on Telegram on Wednesday that children were among those buried under the hospital's wreckage, as he repeated his call for the declaration of a no-fly zone over Ukraine — which U.S. and NATO officials again ruled out after the hospital bombing, which they condemned.

""Atrocity! How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror?"" Zelensky said.

What he's saying: ""A children's hospital. Maternity hospital. What did they threaten the Russian Federation with?"" Zelensky said in a televised address on Wednesday.

""What kind of country is this — the Russian Federation, which is afraid of hospitals and maternity hospitals and destroys them?"" he continued.

""Did someone in the maternity hospital abuse Russian speakers? What was that? Was it the deNazification of the hospital?"" added Zelensky, who is Jewish — referring to Putin's widely derided claims that his goal was to ""demilitarize and de-Nazify Ukraine.""

By the numbers: Mariupol officials say nearly 1,200 people have been killed during days of shelling in the port city of 430,000 that's reportedly surrounded by Russian forces.

World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement Wednesday the WHO had verified 18 attacks on health facilities in Ukraine, ""including 10 deaths and 16 injuries.""

The big picture: There has been intense shelling across Ukraine in the past 24 hours, but U.S. military officials said Russian forces had continued to stall — except in Kharkiv and Mykolaiv, where ""heavy fighting"" was taking place, per AP.

Zelensky said in his TV address that 35,000 people had been evacuated, as authorities announced fresh cease-fires to allow more civilians to leave via humanitarian corridors.

The Ukrainian leader said these evacuations would be from Sumy, northeastern Ukraine, Kyiv and its surrounding areas, and from Enerhodar in the south — where Russian forces last week seized Europe's largest nuclear power station.

Situation report: The U.K. Ministry of Defense said in an intelligence update Thursday that the huge Russian convoy near Kyiv ""has made little progress in over a week and is suffering continued losses at the hands of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.""

""There has been a notable decrease in Russian air activity over Ukraine in recent days, likely due to the effectiveness and endurance of"" Ukrainian forces, the Defense Ministry noted.

Between the lines: ""Russia has deployed conscript troops to Ukraine despite public assurances from President Putin not to do so,"" according to the U.K. Defense Ministry.

""As casualties mount, President Putin will be forced to draw from across the Russian Armed Forces and other sources to replace his losses.""

What to watch: The International Criminal Court is already investigating allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide committed in Ukraine.

Video provided by local leaders showed a charred building missing windows and surrounded by piles of debris. The Associated Press reported a series of blasts and a crater extending at least two stories deep at the scene, where soldiers rushed to evacuate victims, including a pregnant and bleeding woman.

The head of Ukraine’s Donetsk region reported 17 people were wounded, including staff and mothers in the hospital complex’s maternity ward, but there were no immediate reports of injured children or deaths.

""The destruction is enormous,"" the Mariupol City Council said in a Telegram post about the hospital.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also tweeted a video showing damage and said ""children are under the wreckage."" His claims could not immediately be verified by NBC News, and Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilians.

The apparent attack by Russia was condemned by international leaders, including U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who tweeted that it was ""depraved,"" and the Vatican's secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, who said ""there are no reasons, there are no motivations, to do this.""

The bombardment on Mariupol comes as roughly 200,000 civilians have attempted to evacuate the city in recent days without success amid days of intense shelling and as the death toll mounts. Mariupol Deputy Mayor Sergei Orlov said on MSNBC that the estimate of 1,200 civilian casualties is low. He said a mass grave for nearly 50 people was dug Tuesday and a 6-year-old girl had died of dehydration after being ""blocked"" inside a building.

These are not the final numbers, Orlov said. ""We think it's three or four times more.""

Latest developments on Ukraine:

U.S. officials are concerned Russia could be preparing to use chemical or biological weapons after accusing Ukraine of possibly planning a false-flag chemical weapon attack.

Roughly 35,000 civilians were able to evacuate from some Ukrainian cities and towns Wednesday during what was supposed to be a daylong cease-fire in six areas around the country, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.

In the besieged port city Mariupol, local officials accused Russian forces of hitting a children's hospital with airstrikes.

Zelenskyy urged allies to provide air support, warning the world would be responsible for a ""humanitarian catastrophe.""

The Kremlin accused the U.S. of waging “economic war” with sanctions after Biden banned Russian oil.

In Washington, U.S. officials say said they were concerned Russia could be preparing to use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine after the Russian Defense Ministry accused its neighbor of possibly planning a false-flag chemical weapon attack.

A Biden administration official told NBC News the U.S. is worried the Russians are making this claim against Ukraine “to justify a false-flag operation or them using chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine themselves.”

“We do believe that we should be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons,” the official said.

In a false-flag operation, one side of a conflict commits an act and tries to make it appear as though the other side committed it, often in order to justify an attack.

Ukraine launched a fresh effort to clear residents from battered areas Wednesday, though it was again beset by accusations that Russian forces had not kept up their end of a cease-fire agreement.

Russia accused the United States of declaring “economic war” as President Vladimir Putin’s invasion left his country facing military struggles in Ukraine as well as crippling sanctions and isolation from the West.

Ukrainian officials say Russian forces have bombarded cities and civilians but are straining to make progress in their military offensive during nearly two weeks of devastating war.

Zelenskyy urged the United States and its allies to shore up Kyiv’s aerial defenses or share responsibility for “humanitarian catastrophe” with Moscow after a rare sign of disunity between his country’s backers over the supply of fighter jets.

Ukraine’s fierce resistance has inflicted heavier-than-expected losses on Russia’s military, stoking fears that Putin could intensify his push to grind down that defense and worsen an already dire situation.

Hundreds of civilians have died and more than 2 million people have fled to neighboring countries in Europe's fastest-growing refugee crisis since World War II.

The conflict has also fueled concerns about nuclear fallout, both via military escalation and the safety of the country's power plants. In Chernobyl, where Russian troops seized control weeks ago, officials raised new alarm about the plant’s safety Wednesday. The International Atomic Energy Agency said it had lost data transmission from its systems to monitor nuclear material at Chernobyl and another Ukrainian power plant under Russian control.

IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said the disconnect would not have a critical impact on essential functions, but both developments are raising concerns about the safety and security of the country’s nuclear facilities.

New evacuation efforts

Russia and Ukraine agreed to daylong cease-fires and “humanitarian corridors” in six areas after days of largely failed efforts to free civilians trapped without vital supplies. Some of those evacuations appeared to be progressing, including in the northeastern city of Sumy, where officials said more than 20,000 people had left in buses and cars along the established route.

It came a day after about 5,000 people were able to escape Sumy, but residents in Mariupol once again saw their hopes dashed after Ukrainian officials accused Russia of shelling the evacuation route.

The city has been without electricity, heat, water or food for many days and Ukrainian officials have called the situation there catastrophic. Dmytro Kuleba, the foreign minister, accused Russia of holding 400,000 residents hostage by continuing to shell the city.

""There is no heating, electricity, water, natural gas, connection -- in other words, there is nothing,"" said Aleksey Berntsev, the head of the local Red Cross. “The water is collected from the roofs after the rain.”

The six areas authorities were hoping to evacuate Wednesday were Sumy, Mariupol, Enerhodar in the south, Volnovakha in the southeast, Izyum in the east, and several towns in the Kyiv region.

Evacuations from some areas outside Kyiv progressed Wednesday afternoon, but departures from at least three other places appeared to stall, with Ukrainian officials accusing Russian forces of continued shelling. In one town just outside Kyiv, Russian forces blocked buses from passing, according to a post from the Telegram channel of the country’s parliament.

Residents from Irpin, a city just outside Kyiv, have been evacuated throughout the past few days as Putin's troops press their advance on the capital. Earlier this week, residents attempting to flee to the capital without a safe corridor came under fire from Russian forces.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraine-renews-effort-evacuate-civilians-isolated-russia-promises-ceas-rcna19260

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said Putin rejected every off-ramp offered by the United States to de-escalate the conflict in Ukraine.

“We’ve sought to provide possible off-ramps to President Putin. He’s the only one who can decide whether or not to take them. So far, every time there’s been an opportunity to do just that, he’s pressed the accelerator and continued down this horrific road that he’s been pursuing,” Blinken said at a joint news conference with his British counterpart Liz Truss.

“If he tries to enforce such a puppet regime by keeping Russian forces in Ukraine, it will be a long, bloody, drawn-out mess,” he added.

The top diplomats from the UK and the United States have again ruled out establishing a no-fly zone over Ukraine, even a limited one to protect humanitarian corridors.

“The reality is that setting up a no-fly zone would lead to a direct confrontation between NATO and Russia,” UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told reporters.

“And that is not what we are looking at. What we are looking at is making sure that the Ukrainians are able to defend their own country with the best possible selection of anti-tank weapons and anti-air defence systems.”

Ukrainian official accuses Russia of largely failing to respect evacuation plans

An adviser to Ukraine’s interior ministry has accused Russian forces of largely failing to respect agreements to allow civilians to be evacuated from towns and cities through humanitarian corridors.

Evacuations took place from the cities of Sumy and Enerhodar, but not from Kharkiv and only partially in areas in the Kyiv region, Vadym Denysenko said in televised remarks.

Kyiv had earlier said it would attempt to evacuate civilians through six humanitarian corridors on Wednesday – from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia; Enerhodar to Zaporizhzhia; Sumy to Poltava; Izyum to Lozova; Volnovakha to Pokrovske; and from several towns around Kyiv, including Vorzel, Borodyanka, Bucha, Irpin and Hostomel, to the capital.

Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in a video statement that Ukrainian armed forces had agreed to stop firing in those areas from 9am until 9pm local time (07:00-19:00 GMT) and urged Russian forces to fulfil their commitment to local ceasefires.

“How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror? Close the sky right now! Stop the killings! You have power but you seem to be losing humanity,” he added.

Zelenskyy also shared footage from the scene of the alleged attack which appeared to show several wrecked rooms along a corridor in a building that had blown-out windows. Outside of the building, a square carpeted with rubble and debris could be seen.

Orchestra holds open-air concert in central Kyiv

Members of the Kyiv-Classic Symphony Orchestra have held an open-air concert in the Ukrainian capital’s Independence Square.

Dozens of people brazed freezing temperatures to gather for the impromptu musical offering, which included a rendition of the national anthem and an excerpt from Beethoven’s, Ode to Joy, on which the European Union’s anthem is based.

Some of those in attendance waved Ukrainian flags, while conductor Herman Makarenko told reporters that the concert was a call for peace.

“We would like to support our president … who called, calls and will call to all governments of the world [to] stop the war in Ukraine,” Makarenko was quoted as saying by the Reuters news agency.

His efforts came against the backdrop of wailing air raid sirens and soldiers searching cars at checkpoints on main thoroughfares – stark reminders that the city is firmly on a war footing.

Canada to send Ukraine $50m worth of military aid ‘in the coming days’

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said his government will send an additional $50m worth of military aid to Ukraine.

Trudeau said during a visit to Berlin that Ottawa will be able to start sending the “highly-specialised” equipment, including cameras used in drones, “in the coming days”.

He acknowledged that there were challenges in terms of getting equipment securely into Ukrainian hands, but said Canadian officials were “working through that”.

Russia acknowledges conscripts were deployed to Ukraine

Russia’s defence ministry has acknowledged that some conscripts have participated in the war in Ukraine days after Putin denied that was the case.

The ministry said that some of the conscripts had been taken prisoner by Ukrainian forces. But it claimed that “practically all” such individuals deployed to neighbouring Ukraine had now been pulled back to Russia.

All Russian men aged 18-27 must by law do a year’s military service, although there are some exceptions to that rule.

Putin said earlier this week that only professional soldiers and officers had been deployed as part of Moscow’s offensive.

Mariupol dead being buried in mass grave: Report

Local authorities in Mariupol are burying their dead in a mass grave, The Associated Press has reported.

With the city under steady bombardment, officials had been waiting for a chance to allow individual burials to resume. But with morgues overflowing, and many corpses uncollected at home, they decided they had to take action.

A deep trench some 25 metres (80 feet) long has been opened in one of the city’s old cemeteries in the heart of the city, according to the AP. Social workers brought 30 bodies wrapped in carpets or bags on Wednesday, after 40 were brought on Tuesday.

The dead include civilian victims of shelling on the city, as well as some soldiers. Workers with the municipal social services have also been collecting bodies from homes, including some civilians who died of disease or natural causes.

No mourners were present and no families said their goodbyes, AP reported.

An evacuation route from Izyum to Lozova was one of the six humanitarian corridors announced by Kyiv earlier on Wednesday, but Oleh Synehubov said buses were still waiting at the entrance to the town and hence had not been able to ferry people out.

UN nuclear watchdog says Chernobyl power cut has no critical impact on safety

EU adds 160 Russian oligarchs, lawmakers to sanctions blacklist

The EU is stepping up its sanctions response to Moscow’s actions in Ukraine, targeting more Russian lawmakers and oligarchs as well as banks in Moscow’s ally Belarus.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the 27-nation bloc was blacklisting 160 more individuals, banning exports of maritime navigation technology to Russia and including crypto assets under its punitive measures.

“We are further tightening the net of sanctions responding to Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine,” she tweeted.

The names of the 160 individuals – which include 146 members of Russia’s upper house of parliament and 14 Kremlin-linked oligarchs and their relatives – will be unveiled shortly, when the new sanctions are formally published in the EU’s official journal.

Dutch PM says ‘not possible’ for EU to cut off Russian energy supplies immediately

Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has said it is not possible for the EU to immediately cut off Russian supplies of oil and gas to the bloc.

“We have to discuss our vulnerabilities in terms of our dependency on Russian oil and Russian gas. I would not plead for cutting off our supply of oil and gas from Russia today; it’s not possible because we need the supply and that is the uncomfortable truth”, Rutte said during a joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris.

“But we can do more to get the green agenda going, to decarbonise our economies,” he added.

In a daily televised address, Zelenskyy said the threat level in Ukraine was at a maximum nearly two weeks into Russia’s invasion but Ukrainians had shown they would never give in.

“Russia uses missiles, aircraft and helicopters against us, against civilians, against our cities, against our infrastructure. It is the humanitarian duty of the world to respond,” he said.

Energoatom said in a statement that it had not been possible to carry out work to restore power to the site, which has been occupied by Russian troops, because of fighting in the area.

Any warming of the approximately 20,000 spent fuel assemblies at Chernobyl could lead to “the release of radioactive substances into the environment”, it added.

“The radioactive cloud could be carried by wind to other regions of Ukraine, Belarus, Russia, and Europe,” Energoatom said.

‘Conflicting information about humanitarian corridors: AJE correspondent

Al Jazeera’s Natacha Butler, reporting from the city of Lviv, in western Ukraine, says there is a “lot of conflicting information about the implementation of humanitarian corridors in Ukraine”.

“What we do know is that Ukrainian authorities have confirmed that there is a humanitarian corridor from the city of Sumy,” Butler said.

She added the situation elsewhere in the country was unclear despite Ukraine’s announcement of six exit routes.

“Whether or not that actually happens and the fighting stops is another matter indeed,” Butler said.

“All we know for the time being is that Russian officials did earlier make an offer of putting in place humanitarian corridors, but so far those offers, which have been repeated over the past few days, have meant that people could flee not to Western Ukraine or neighbouring countries but to Russia and Belarus,” she added, noting Ukrainian authorities had emphatically rejected such plans.

Kyiv’s residents ‘holding their breath for what’s coming next’: AJE correspondent

Al Jazeera’s Step Vaessen, reporting from Kyiv, says people in the capital are “very well aware … [it] is the main prize in this war”.

“There’s been a very eerie silence, people who are still in the city are holding their breath for what’s coming next,” Vaessen said.

“But this silence has been interrupted in the last hour by artillery fire coming from the northeast of the city. We know there’s also heavy fighting in the northwest – if a bridge in the town of Irpin falls into the hands of Russian troops then the next stop will be Kyiv,” she added.

Vaessen described a palpable feeling of “tension, fear and stress” in the city among those who had opted not to flee and are now readying to defend it from an anticipated Russian attack.

“They have put up barricades with whatever they could find and there are checkpoints everywhere,” she said.

“The Russian advance to the capital has been stalled in the last week, but there [are fears] the advance – and even heavy bombardment – on Kyiv could happen in the next few days.”

“Either Russia will respect international law and will not wage wars, or it will not have the money to start wars.”

It’s ‘clear’ Russia will lose conflict, says US official

Nuland, who is speaking at a congressional hearing, says Russia is destined to lose its war in Ukraine.

“It is clear that Russia will lose this conflict – whether they lose it quickly or whether they lose it extremely slowly, it is only a matter of time,” said the State Department under secretary.

“The problem is that if this can be lost quickly, many, many, many lives will be saved, which is why we have to continue to pour on the economic pressure; we have to continue to support the defensive needs of the Ukrainian people.”

‘This war is not good for China,’ says US

Nuland, who is speaking at a continuing congressional hearing, says US officials’ engagements with China – including a recent call between the US secretary of state and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi – aimed to get Beijing to influence Moscow to end the invasion.

“Our intention in our regular engagement with China, including Secretary Blinken’s call with his counterpart, was to underscore that this war is not good for China, that we want to see China use its influence with Russia to get this war ended, and at a minimum to help get these humanitarian corridors going,” Nuland told US legislators.

“And that if they are concerned about their economic situation as they should well be, with the lowest growth rates in 15 years, that this war is contributing to it.”

Ukraine first lady condemns ‘mass murder’ of civilians

Olena Zelenska, the Ukrainian president’s wife, has thanked Kyiv’s allies for their support and urged them to do more to deter Russia.

Zelenska also said in an open letter that the Russian invasion of Ukraine amounted to “the mass murder of Ukrainian civilians”.

“The most terrifying and devastating of this invasion are the child casualties,” she said, mentioning eight-year-old Alice, who died on the streets of Okhtyrka while her grandfather tried to protect her, and Polina, a child from Kyiv, who died in shelling alongside her parents.

She also cited 14-year-old Arseniy, who was hit in the head by wreckage and could not be saved because an ambulance could not get to him on time because of intense fires.

Russia ready to provide humanitarian corridors from Kyiv, other cities

Russian forces will stop firing from 10am Moscow time (07:00 GMT) on Wednesday and are ready to provide humanitarian corridors so people can leave Kyiv and four other cities, the TASS news agency reported, citing a senior Russian official.

Mikhail Mizintsev, the head of Russia’s national defence control centre, said information about corridors from Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol will be sent to Ukraine’s deputy prime minister.

“Given the deteriorating humanitarian situation … and in order to ensure the safety of civilians and foreign citizens, Russia will observe a regime of silence from 10 am Moscow time on March 9 and is ready to provide humanitarian corridors,” Tass cited Mizintsev as saying.

Mizintsev earlier said Ukrainian authorities had endorsed only one civilian evacuation route from areas affected by fighting out of 10 that were proposed by Moscow, including five towards territory controlled by Kyiv.

Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the US House of Representatives, has said the chamber is set to pass a Russian sanctions bill later on Tuesday. She said the legislation would support Biden’s decision to ban Russian oil imports.

“Our bill has three major provisions: it will ban the import of Russian oil & energy products into the US, it will take steps to review Russia’s access to the WTO and explore how we can diminish Russia in the global economy & it will reauthorize & strengthen the Magnitsky Act,” Pelosi wrote on Twitter.

US Congress edges closer to authorising aid for Ukraine

The US Congress appears to be on the cusp of an agreement that would allocate billions of dollars in emergency aid for Ukraine, among other things.

Sweeping legislation, awaiting final approval from Democratic and Republican congressional leaders, was expected to provide as much as $14bn to help Ukraine respond to Russia’s invasion.

“Republicans and Democrats are very, very close to finalising the agreement. I expect there will be text released in a few hours,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters at a mid-afternoon news conference.

Two G7 nations cannot ban the world’s second largest oil producer without tangible consequences.

Some of this is already factored in to the global price for crude oil, record pump petrol and particularly diesel prices.

President Biden was candid with the American people that there was a “price” for freedom.

PM Johnson hopes that the price can be minimised by phasing in a ban over the course of this year.

Even without formal diplomatic bans, an unofficial embargo is occurring in the markets. Shell was pilloried by Ukraine’s foreign minister for buying a cheap tanker of unwanted Russian crude, and has since apologised. Another tanker was turned away from Tranmere docks by unions refusing to offload the crude, and is now waiting near Orkney for a purchaser.

Though there are no sanctions on Russian energy in the EU plan, if followed, it will have a bigger overall impact on the energy market. And most of the West is trying to do the same thing at the same time.

But this is the economic weapon that will most hit the Kremlin. Oil revenues are much more important than gas revenues. There are also other options for the world’s supply of crude oil, stretching from Venezuela to the Gulf.

This will come with a price, paid by everyone. It was a price President Putin assumed Western populations would not want to pay. It is now happening.",https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-60657155/page/8

Russian forces bombarded the Ukrainian city Mariupol again on Thursday amid international outrage over the bombing of a children's hospital there, while a massive convoy that has been stalled for over a week outside Kyiv appeared to split up into surrounding towns and forests.

Civilians in the port city of Mariupol are facing increasingly dire conditions with scarce food, fuel and electricity. Bodies are being buried in mass graves.

The Kremlin displayed harried confusion in its response to criticism Thursday, at times completely denying the Mariupol hospital bombing and at other moments alleging an elaborate propaganda ploy by the West.

Photos and video of the bombing's aftermath clearly show severely injuried people - including a pregnant woman - being taken by stretcher from the rubble.

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, however, has said the building was a hospital and called the attack an ""atrocity.""

The hospital complex in Mariupol bombed Wednesday resulted in at least three deaths, including one child, Ukraine authorities say. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov dismissed the claim Thursday, saying the hospital had been emptied of patients and was being used as an extremist base.

The attack was condemned internationally and branded a ""war crime"" by Ukrainian and Western leaders. French President Emmanuel Macron called it “a shameful and immoral act of war.” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said it was ""horrific"" and ""barbaric.""

""This is not the first time when we see pathetic cries about so-called atrocities committed by the Russian armed forces,"" Lavrov said. ""Our delegation presented facts at a meeting of the U.N. Security Council proving that the maternity hospital had long been seized by fighters of the Azov battalion and other radicals. They kicked all patients, all nurses, and all service personnel out.""

Later, Russia denied responsibility entirely and claimed the attack was staged to make the Kremlin look bad. Russia’s Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov denied the strike. He claimed that the two explosions that ravaged the building were caused by explosive devices planted nearby in what he described as a “staged provocation to incite anti-Russian agitation in the West.”

Meanwhile, the highest-level talks yet failed to reach agreement on a humanitarian cease-fire aimed at protecting Ukraine cities battered by fierce Russian assaults.

In Poland, Vice President Kamala Harris reiterated the U.S. commitment to NATO and defense of its members is ""ironclad."" Harris, during a joint news conference in Warsaw with Polish President Andrzej Duda, said America is deeply appreciative of Poland's efforts to aid refugees fleeing the carnage in Ukraine.

""This is a moment that requires severe and swift consequences for Russian aggression against Ukraine,"" Harris said. ""What is at stake, this very moment, are some of the guiding principles around the NATO alliance.""

The meeting came after the Biden administration rejected a plan from Poland that would involve U.S. involvement in providing fighter jets to Ukraine, a decision drawing questions from some Republican senators. U.S. defense officials also have distanced themselves from Ukraine requests for a NATO-backed no-fly zone over the country.

In Turkey, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov met, the most pressing issue the southern port of Mariupol. The city has been rocked by two weeks of unrelenting bombardment leaving inhabitants struggling to obtain, food, water, shelter and other basic necessities. Multiple rounds of talks aimed at protecting Ukraine's civilians have also failed to make headway toward peace.

Latest developments:

► Congress passed $13.6 billion in humanitarian aid money for Ukraine and allies as part of a larger spending package that received bipartisan support in the Senate on Thursday.

►In addition to the more than 2.3 million people who have fled the war in Ukraine, an estimated 1.9 million people are displaced within the country, according to the U.N.

►Russian President Vladimir Putin shrugged off sanctions from the West, saying they are nothing new for Russians. ″Just as we overcame these difficulties in the previous years, we will overcome them now,"" he said at a televised meeting of government officials. He acknowledged the sanctions create “certain challenges.”

►Former Vice President Mike Pence and wife Karen visited Thursday with Ukraine refugees at the Korczowa border crossing in Poland. ""The impact of the Russian invasion on these families is heartbreaking and the need for support is great,"" Pence said on Twitter.

►The U.N. refugee agency says more than 2.3 million Ukrainians have fled the country, over 1.4 million of them through Poland. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said late Thursday that about 100,000 people have fled over the last two days through evacuation corridors.

►A Ukrainian man learned his family was killed through graphic images circulating on Twitter. Serhiy Perebyinis told The New York Times he first recognized the luggage in the photo where the lifeless bodies of his wife and two children were lying on the ground after being hit by shrapnel from a Russian mortar shelling Sunday.

Biden to call for suspending Russia's preferential trade status over Ukraine

President Joe Biden will announce Friday the U.S. will join the European Union and G7 allies in calling to revoke Russia's permanent normal trade relations status, which would allow new tariffs on Russian imports, according to a source familiar with the decision.

The move, which requires congressional action, comes as a group of bipartisan lawmakers has pressured the president to take more aggressive action to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. The source said Biden looks forward to working with Congress on legislation to revoke Russia's permanent normal trade relations status.

Biden's expected announcement would put Moscow's trade relationship with the U.S. in the same category as North Korea and Cuba. Read more here.

Zelenskyy worries Russia could use chemical or bioweapons in Ukraine

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denied Russia’s accusation that Ukraine is preparing to attack with chemical or biological weapons, and he said the accusation itself was a bad sign.

“That worries me very much because we have often been convinced that if you want to know Russia’s plans, they are what Russia accuses others of,” he said in his nightly address to the nation.

Russia said it uncovered plans to create secret laboratories in Ukraine to produce biological weapons.

“I am a reasonable person. The president of a reasonable country and reasonable people. I am the father of two children,” Zelenskyy said. “And no chemical or any other weapon of mass destruction has been developed on my land. The whole world knows this.”

His comments came as the U.S. and other Western leaders expressed similar concerns that Russia was hinting as its possible next move in using such weapons in the war in Ukraine.

Nuclear research facility hit by Russian shelling

Russian forces shelled a nuclear research institute in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city on Thursday, setting buildings ablaze, said Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s Interior Ministry.

A shell hit a building where there is equipment that could release radiation if it were damaged, Gerashchenko said. According to the president’s office, there has been no change in the background radiation.

The shelling caused a fire, but firefighters were able to put it out.

Russian forces have already taken over two nuclear power plants in Ukraine, raising concerns about the security of nuclear facilities in the country.

State Department vows to hold Russians responsible for war crimes

The United States has seen “very credible reports” of deliberate attacks by Russians on Ukrainian civilians that would qualify as a war crime under international law, State Department spokesman Ned Price said Thursday.

That could include the recent assault on the maternity and children’s hospital complex as well as strikes on schools, residential buildings, public buses and ambulances, he said. Price said the U.S. will do everything possible to hold accountable every Russian political leader, military commander and service member who participates in a war crime.

“Criminal prosecutions are one possibility,” he said.

The U.S. has the ability to conduct its own in-depth investigations and will support the appropriate international investigations, Price said. The International Criminal Court announced last week it’s investigating possible war crimes by Russia in Ukraine. Price was also pushed on the administration’s rejection of Poland’s offer to transfer Soviet-era fighter planes to the U.S., which could then give the planes to Ukraine.

Price repeated the administration’s argument that having the planes pass through U.S. hands would risk escalating the war. Asked if the U.S. would still support the original goal of having Poland transfer its planes directly to Ukraine, Price said that’s up to Poland.

“Individual NATO allies, individual countries are going to make sovereign decisions on what… they deem to be in their best interest,” he said.

Twitter to start labeling Belarus state media content

Twitter announced Thursday it will label accounts and tweets linked to state media content in Belarus, a Russian ally. The move comes after the company launched labels on Kremlin-linked media accounts last week.

""As is standard with these labels, we’ll reduce the visibility of labeled Tweets and accounts, and show a prompt before you can share labeled Tweets,"" said Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of site integrity.

Roth said adding labels to Russian state media has shown a decrease of 30% in impressions on its content.

Big tech companies have had to grapple with how to approach state media and propaganda. Google said it would block YouTube channels linked to Russian state media. Read more here.

Some U.S. universities cutting financial, academic ties to Russia

Some public American universities with investments in Russia are cutting financial and academic ties to the country following its invasion of Ukraine, including all of Arizona’s public universities.

“Obviously we see the invasion of Ukraine as the actions of a mad despot and so we want to do as little as possible to help him in any possible way,” said Michael Crow, president of Arizona State University, one of the largest public institutions in the country.

Similar actions have been taken by the Texas A & M University and the University of Colorado systems.

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology also recently cut ties to a Russian university it helped launch, and Middlebury College withdrew students that had been studying in the country.

Ukrainian man discovers family was killed after seeing Twitter post

A Ukrainian man waited to hear that his wife and children had safely evacuated to Kyiv amid the Russian invasion. Hours later, he learned his family was killed through graphic images circulating on Twitter.

Serhiy Perebyinis told The New York Times he first recognized the luggage in the photo where the lifeless bodies of his wife, Tetiana Perebyinis, 43, and their two children, Mykyta, 18, and Alisa, 9, and church volunteer Anatoly Berezhnyi, 26, were laying on the ground after being hit by shrapnel from a Russian mortar shelling on Sunday.

They were attempting to cross a bridge to safety when the mortar detonated 12 yards away from the family in the town of Irpin. Serhiy told the outlet he was in eastern Ukraine trying to help his sick mother when Tetiana decided it was time to flee to Kyiv.

“I told her, ‘Forgive me that I couldn’t defend you,’” he said. “I tried to care for one person, and it meant I cannot protect you.”

Ukrainian Paralympic athletes protest at China games

Ukrainian athletes at the Paralympics Games in China held a demonstration on Thursday at the Athletes Village, donning blue and yellow and holding a large banner that read, ""Peace For All.""

The group held a minute of silence and called for peace before noting how personally impacted they have been by the war. Andriy Nesterenko, the head coach of the delegation, noted how members of their team were from areas that have been ravaged by the war. He said ""some of them doesn’t have the possibility to come back. Their flats, their private houses are already destroyed,"" he told reporters at the demonstration, according to The New York Times.

Already, a Ukrainian biathlete had to withdraw from a competition at the games after her father was captured by Russian troops. Anastasiia Laletina did not race in the biathlon middle distance sitting event Tuesday after she heard her father, a soldier in the Ukrainian army was taken prisoner by Russian soldiers, team spokesperson Nataliia Harach confirmed to USA TODAY Sports on Tuesday. He was beaten and being treated by doctors.

The games barred Russia from competing in the games, citing tensions in the Athletes Village. The Russian Paralympic Committee called the decision “absolutely politicized.”

Republicans attack Biden’s handling of Polish fighter jet proposal

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday attacked what he called the Biden administration’s “confusing mismanagement and mixed signals” on the Ukraine crisis. The Kentucky Republican was referring to the Polish government’s surprise offer this week to give its Soviet-era fighter jets to the U.S., which would then give the planes to Ukraine. The administration, which had anticipated Poland would directly provide the planes to Ukraine, called Poland’s offer “untenable.” Involving the U.S. and a NATO air base would run a “high risk” of escalating the war, the Pentagon said Wednesday.

At least a dozen senators urged the Biden administration to reconsider. Some accused the White House of abandoning an ally in its time of need, while others implored it to stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin or risk having him try to conquer other U.S. allies – or even America itself. Republican senators continued to rail against the administration at a press conference Thursday afternoon.

“I just want to let people know that on March the sixth, the United States policy was green-lighting MiGs to Ukraine if Poland did it. Now that Poland's asked us to be part of the transfer system, we all of a sudden say no,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. “And here's what breaks my heart. This is dishonorable. It's one thing to be incompetent. It's another thing to be dishonorable.”

Fellow Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said the U.S. isn't sending the right message to Putin. “If we continue to blink every time Vladimir Putin says ‘Boo,’ he's not going to stop in Ukraine, he's not going to stop in Europe,” Cotton said.

CIA chief: Putin can’t ‘bottle up the truth indefinitely’

Russian President Vladimir Putin has masked the costs of the Ukraine invasion in his own country through the dominance of state media and the “strangulation of independent media” but won’t be able to hide the truth indefinitely, according to CIA Director William Burns. Burns, a former ambassador to the Russian federation, told the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday that many Russians have virtual private network accounts and retain access to YouTube and other sources of independent information.

As the damage mounts, Burns said Putin’s propaganda bubble would be punctured by the number of troops killed and wounded, the economic consequences of a worldwide trade embargo and the horrific scenes of hospitals and schools being bombed.

“I don’t believe that he is going to be able to seal Russians off entirely from the truth,” Burns said. “I don’t think he can bottle up the truth indefinitely.”

Haines: ‘No evidence’ Ukraine is pursuing biological, nuclear weapons

Ukraine is not pursuing biological or nuclear weapons, as Russia has falsely spread through propaganda, the top U.S. intelligence official told a Senate panel Thursday.

Russia has accused the U.S. of sponsoring biological weapons research in Ukraine since invading the neighboring country two weeks ago. Igor Konashenkov, a spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry, accused Ukraine of preparing a chemical attack. Avril Haines, the director of national intelligence, testified that Ukraine has a dozen biological research labs developing countermeasures and how to prevent the spread of pandemics, but not weapons labs.

“I want to be absolutely clear that we do not believe that Ukraine is pursuing biological or nuclear weapons. We’ve seen no evidence of that,” Haines told the Senate Intelligence Committee. “This influence campaign is completely consistent with longstanding Russian efforts to accuse the United States of sponsoring bio weapons work in the former Soviet Union. This is a classic move by the Russians.”

Borislav Bereza, former member of Ukrainian parliament and member of Ukrainian delegation in Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, posted a statement on social media warning that Russia could have a dangerous motive: ""This is actually an announcement and confession that Russia is planning to use chemical weapons in the near future.""

Harris: UN will investigate Russian assault on hospital

Vice President Kamala Harris said Russia’s airstrikes on hospitals were “atrocities of unimaginable proportion” and said the United Nations has a process to review and investigate to investigate such attacks. The World Health Organization says at least 18 attacks have been conducted on medical facilities since the invasion began Feb. 24.

Harris noted that “the eyes of the world are on this war and what Russia has done in terms of this aggression and these atrocities.”

Ukraine said Russian bombs severely damaged a maternity and children's hospital complex in the besieged city of Mariupol on Wednesday, killing at least three people including a child and wounding at least 17 more.

“Russians are committing war crimes,"" Polish President Duda said. “I hope that also in the future, it will be obvious for a court investigating those issues who bears responsibility for that.""

Kyiv mayor: Half the city has fled

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said Thursday that about 2 million people – half the population of the capital’s metropolitan area – have fled the city amid constant bombings from the Russian military. But he said the spirit of the city remains strong. Fighting is fierce, and the city has become a fortress, he said.

“Everyone says 'Nothing will happen, we will not surrender our city,'"" Klitschko said. ""I can repeat these words: The city stood, the people will stand. They won't give up. And the enemy won't pass.""

World champion British soccer team, owned by Russian, hit with sanctions

Roman Abramovich's attempt to sell British soccer team Chelsea has been halted after the Russian oligarch was sanctioned by the U.K. government. Last year, Forbes magazine estimated Chelsea's value at $3.2 billion. Abramovich put the team up for sale last week, shortly before his assets were frozen.

The team cannot sell game tickets or merchandise. The British government is allowing the team to play its games, including one scheduled for Thursday night. Ticket-holders will be allowed to attend matches and staff will be paid. Abramovich, who made his fortune in oil and aluminum, has not condemned Russia’s invasion.

Suffering increases for Ukrainians

Ukrainian leaders say civilians are increasingly suffering and dying as Russia's assault on Ukraine enters its third week. Multiple hospitals have been shelled, more than 2.3 million people have fled the country and more are struggling to leave. On the outskirts of Kyiv, hundreds of residents in towns occupied by Russian troops fled Wednesday. Some said they hadn't eaten in days, while others told harrowing tales of war.

“Occupiers came to our house and they were ready to shoot us,"" said Iuliia Bushinska, a Vorzel resident. ""They took away our house, our car, they took away our documents. So we need to start our life from the beginning.

A Russian airstrike devastated a maternity and children's hospital complex in the besieged southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, burying women and children under debris and injuring more than a dozen, Ukrainian officials said Wednesday.

The Mariupol City Council posted video on social media of the battered buildings.

""The destruction is enormous,"" the council said in a statement. ""The building of the medical institution where the children were treated recently was completely destroyed. Information about the affected children is being clarified.""

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said people were trapped in the wreckage after the strike. He once again urged the West to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine.

""Atrocity! How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror?"" Zelenskyy said in a Twitter post. ""Close the sky right now! Stop the killings! You have power but you seem to be losing humanity.""

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday reiterated that the U.S. and its allies won't establish a no-fly zone because it could drag the alliance further into the war.

The West has hit Russia with heavy economic sanctions, and on Wednesday the Kremlin threatened retaliation, also possibly in the form of sanctions, for the ""economic war"" it accused the U.S. of waging.

Russia has repeatedly tried to rationalize its attack on Ukraine and has asserted that the U.S. is creating chemical and biological weapons in the country. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki issued a troubling warning Wednesday evening that in the aftermath of the claims, ""we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them.""

Latest developments:

►The price of gas across much of Europe has risen above 2 euros per liter — the equivalent of about $8.33 per gallon. Filling up a compact car can cost $100.

House votes to ban imports of Russian oil and energy products

In a rare show of bipartisanship, the House voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to write into law a ban on U.S. imports of Russian oil and energy products that President Joe Biden imposed to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine.

The legislation, which passed on a 414 to 17 vote, now heads to the Senate, which hasn't indicated when it would consider the measure. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said leaders would want to consult with the Biden administration first.

House approval of the measure came the day after Biden said he would sign an order banning imports of all Russian energy products in the latest effort to ratchet up sanctions over the invasion. Biden said he made the decision in consultation with European allies but added they may not be in a position to join the U.S. in banning Russian energy imports. Read more here.

US House passes massive spending bill with Ukraine aid

The U.S. House of Representatives passed $13.6 billion in aid money to Ukraine Wednesday night as part of a larger spending bill.

The money to Ukraine included $6.5 billion to cover the cost of sending U.S. troops and weapons and equipping allied forces in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. $6.8 billion in aid was marked for refugees and giving help to allies. Other funds went to help U.S. federal agencies enforce sanctions against Russia and protect against cyber threats.

The amount surpassed the $10 billion President Joe Biden requested from Congress, but the spending package still has to pass the Senate.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., had to concede another $15.6 billion that was supposed to go toward combating the COVID pandemic in order to rush the aid through for Ukraine. Both Democrats and Republicans will achieve wins in the $1.5 trillion package if it goes through the Senate.

White House warns Russia may use chemical weapons in Ukraine

The White House issued a troubling warning Wednesday evening that Russia might attempt to use chemical weapons in its siege of Ukraine.

The warning came from White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki after an array of claims made by the Kremlin to justify its invasion of Ukraine, including the long debunked assertion that the U.S. was creating chemical and biological weapons in the country. Without evidence, China similarly echoed the claim.

Psaki, in a Twitter thread, responded in detail to the claims and warned it was part of a ""pattern"" by Russia to accuse the West ""of the very violations that Russia itself is perpetrating.""

""Now that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them,"" Psaki said.

Russia's accusations echo the country's disinformation tactics used in Syria after chemical weapons were used to kill more than 1,400, including children, according to Andrew Weber, a former Pentagon official who spent decades working for the U.S. government to counter such weapons and helped in the effort to destroy Syrian chemical weapons stockpiles.

Weber, in an interview with Mother Jones, said it was possible that Putin might use nuclear weapons in the conflict. But more possible, Weber said, would be that Putin ""would use chemical or biological weapons.""

The U.S. State Department similarly said the allegations were part of a propaganda effort by the Kremlin by ""inventing false pretexts in an attempt to justify its own horrific actions,"" spokesman Ned Price said, adding the U.S. does not develop or possess such weapons anywhere.

VP Kamala Harris in Poland after US rejects fighter jet plan for Ukraine

Vice President Kamala Harris’ trip to staunch ally Poland is now a clean-up mission. A day after the United States declined Poland's surprise proposal to provide Soviet-built MiG-29 fighter jets to the U.S. to give to Ukraine, Harris will meet with the country’s top leaders in Warsaw, where she will need to try to smooth over the controversy.

Harris arrived in Warsaw Wednesday, hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told Polish leaders that the United States does not support the transfer of additional fighter aircraft to the Ukrainian Air Force, according to Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby.

Harris will meet with Ukrainians who have fled to Poland and talk to service members in the U.S. and Polish militaries. She will also confer with allies on what more can be done to put pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Attack on Chernihiv may constitute war crime, Amnesty International says

Across much of Ukraine on Wednesday, efforts to rescue civilians from grim conditions were once again underway. In the Ukraine capital of Kyiv, air raid sirens blared as officials bolstered defenses in key cities where Russian troops have laid siege, trapping civilians inside with little or no food, water or medicine.

In the southern city of Mariupol, the artillery attack that devastated a hospital complex was just the latest tragedy. Days of shelling have largely cut residents of off from the outside world and forced them to scavenge for food and water.

In the northern city of Chernihiv, a Russian airstrike that reportedly killed 47 civilians last week may constitute a war crime, Amnesty International said Wednesday following an investigation into the attack.

""This was a merciless, indiscriminate attack on people as they went about their daily business in their homes, streets and shops,” said Joanne Mariner, Amnesty International’s Crisis Response Director.

Mayor Vladyslav Atroshenko said two-thirds of the almost 300,000 residents are without heat and hot water. He said 60 civilians have died and 400 were wounded – but that the city is holding strong.

No-fly zone remains a non-starter for US, NATO

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken once again rejected a no-fly zone Wednesday when asked during a joint press conference with the United Kingdom’s Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss. Both Blinken and Truss said even limited involvement of the U.S. or NATO would only escalate the war.

Putting “American servicemembers in Ukraine, on Ukrainian territory, or soil, or American pilots into Ukrainian airspace – whether on a full or on a limited basis – would almost certainly lead to direct conflict between the United States, between NATO and Russia,” Blinken said. “And that would expand the conflict, it would prolong it, it would make it much more deadlier than it already is.”

Truss noted that the U.K. had agreed to supply Ukraine with additional defensive weapons. She said that was the best way to help Ukraine counter Russia’s attacks, not creating a no-fly zone.

""What we're looking at is making sure that the Ukrainians are able to defend their own country with the best possible selection of anti-tank weapons and anti-air defense systems,"" Truss said.

Will Russia's rich bail on Putin's war?

Vacated Mediterranean villas, marooned superyachts in search of accepting ports and billions in assets seized or devalued are just some of the headaches Russia's kleptocratic elite now face over President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. The so-called Russian oligarchs who surround the Kremlin – a small cadre of several dozen men who have made their riches thanks to connections to Putin's government – are seen by U.S. and European officials as key to curbing the Russian invasion of Ukraine and potentially building a post-Putin Russia.

""Part of why I think it's so important to go after the Russian oligarchs and the rest of the elite is that suddenly a bunch of oligarchs had to get on private jets, flee Monaco and the south of France and other places they have their homes and head back to Moscow,"" said Max Bergmann, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.

White House: Digital money won't help Russia evade sanctions

The Biden administration's new executive order meant to promote future innovation in cryptocurrency was not affected by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the White House says. Senior officials say they are confident that cryptocurrencies can't serve as an effective workaround for sanctions the U.S. and its allies have imposed on Russian elites and financial intuitions, especially the Russian Central Bank.

Russian banks and citizens have been rushing to transfer their assets into cryptocurrency as the ruble tumbles in value under severe Western sanctions meant to curtail the Kremlin's war machine.

Kremlin says US 'economic war' could bring retaliation

The U.S. is waging a ""de facto economic war"" and Russia could react with retaliatory actions, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday. Peskov was commenting on the U.S. ban on Russian energy imports and a comment on the war by Victoria Nuland, U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, that the U.S. ""must ensure that this Ukraine gambit is a strategic failure for Putin.""

The U.S., European Union, United Kingdom and a scores of other nations have also introduced sanctions against Russian legal entities and private individuals.

""The U.S., undoubtedly, declared an economic war against Russia and they are waging this war,"" Peskov said. He said Russia will do ""what in the best way corresponds to our interests"" but gave no details on the possible retaliatory sanctions.

Chernobyl loses power; Ukraine says radioactive leak possible

The Chernobyl Nuclear Plant, occupied by Russian troops for several days, has been disconnected from the power grid and is a threat to leak radioactive substances, Ukraine's Ukrenergo National Power Company said. Repairs are impossible because of enemy fire and the military presence, the utility said.

The state-run nuclear company Energoatom said radioactive substances could be released from the plant because it cannot properly cool spent nuclear fuel. The International Atomic Energy Agency, however, said the spent fuel storage pool and the volume of cooling water are ""sufficient for effective heat removal"" without access to electricity

The plant, the site of one of the world's worst nuclear disasters in 1986, has not produced power in several years. Decommissioning has not been completed, however, and authorities say there are about 20,000 spent fuel assemblies at Chernobyl that cannot be kept cool amid a power outage.

McDonald’s, Starbucks, Coke and GE suspend business in Russia

McDonald’s, Starbucks, Coca-Cola and General Electric – ubiquitous global brands and symbols of U.S. corporate might – all announced Tuesday they were temporarily suspending their business in Russia in response to the country’s invasion of Ukraine.

“Our values mean we cannot ignore the needless human suffering unfolding in Ukraine,” McDonald’s President and CEO Chris Kempczinski said in an open letter to employees. The Chicago-based burger giant said it will temporarily close 850 stores but continue paying its 62,000 employees in Russia.

McDonald’s is likely to take the biggest financial hit. Unlike Starbucks and other fast food companies, like KFC and Pizza Hut, whose Russian locations are owned by franchisees, McDonald’s owns 84% of its Russian stores.

Starbucks on Tuesday said it would temporarily close 130 Russian stores owned and operated by a franchisee, after earlier saying it would be donating profits from those stores to humanitarian relief efforts in Ukraine. Read more here.

US officials put Americans on alert for Russian cyberattacks

U.S. officials are highly concerned the war in Ukraine could impact American cyber networks as the war enters its third week and Russian President Vladimir Putin grows more isolated.

The nation’s main federal cybersecurity agency told USA TODAY on Tuesday it has been encouraging U.S. organizations to up their security.

“While there are not any specific, credible, cyber threats to the U.S., we encourage all organizations – regardless of size – to take steps now to improve their cybersecurity and safeguard their critical assets,” the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency said in a statement.

The Biden administration sought $10 billion last week in emergency funding from Congress in defense aid, including to support Ukraine’s cyber defenses, as well as $28 million to bolster the FBI’s “investigative and operational response to cyber threats stemming from the Russia threat and war on Ukraine,” according to the supplemental funding request.

15 years for calling Ukraine invasion a 'war'? Russia's new censorship law.

As Russia grows increasingly isolated from the Western world as a result of sanctions and bans over its invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin has, in some ways, embraced the isolation by pushing out non-Russian speech and press.

A bill was quickly passed through both houses of the Kremlin-controlled parliament and signed by Putin on March 4 that criminalizing the intentional spread of information that goes against the government’s narrative, were certain words like “war” and “invasion” can land someone in prison for up to 15 years.

Experts told USA TODAY that Russia has been clamping down on free speech and independent press for years – even decades – without such momentous reaction. The country has even passed a number of similar laws in the past.

This time, the implications could be much more dangerous. Read more here.
