Kramer', 'Livia Albeck-Ripka', 'The New York Times', 'Rebecca Halleck']",2022-03-13 00:00:00,"WASHINGTON — Russia asked China to give it military equipment and support for the war in Ukraine after President Vladimir V. Putin began a full-scale invasion last month, according to U.S. officials.

Russia has also asked China for additional economic assistance, to help counteract the battering its economy has taken from broad sanctions imposed by the United States and European and Asian nations, according to an official.

American officials, determined to keep secret their means of collecting the intelligence on Russia’s requests, declined to describe further the kind of military weapons or aid that Moscow is seeking. The officials also declined to discuss any reaction by China to the requests.

President Xi Jinping of China has strengthened a partnership with Mr. Putin and has stood by him as Russia has stepped up its military campaign in Ukraine, destroying cities and killing hundreds or thousands of civilians. American officials are watching China closely to see whether it will act on any requests of aid from Russia. Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, met on Monday in Rome with Yang Jiechi, a member of the Chinese Communist Party’s elite Politburo and director of the party’s Central Foreign Affairs Commission.

Mr. Sullivan intended to warn Mr. Yang about any future Chinese efforts to bolster Russia in its war or undercut Ukraine, the United States and their partners. The meeting came one day after U.S. officials told The New York Times about Russia’s request for military and economic aid from China. It had been scheduled before the war in Ukraine began and was planned as a follow-up discussion to a video summit meeting between President Biden and Mr. Xi in November.

“We are communicating directly, privately to Beijing that there will absolutely be consequences for large-scale sanctions evasion efforts or support to Russia to backfill them,” Mr. Sullivan said on CNN on Sunday.

“We will not allow that to go forward and allow there to be a lifeline to Russia from these economic sanctions from any country, anywhere in the world,” he said.

Mr. Sullivan did not make any explicit mention of potential military support from China, but other U.S. officials spoke about the request from Russia on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of diplomatic and intelligence matters.

Liu Pengyu, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said he had never heard of the request from Russia. “The current situation in Ukraine is indeed disconcerting,” he said, adding that Beijing wants to see a peaceful settlement. “The high priority now is to prevent the tense situation from escalating or even getting out of control.”

The Biden administration is seeking to lay out for China the consequences of its alignment with Russia and penalties it will incur if it continues or increases its support. Some U.S. officials argue it might be possible to dissuade Beijing from ramping up its assistance to Moscow. Chinese leaders may be content to offer rhetorical support for Moscow and may not want to further enmesh themselves with Mr. Putin by providing military support for the war, those U.S. officials say.

Mr. Sullivan said China “was aware before the invasion took place that Vladimir Putin was planning something,” but added that the Chinese might not have known the full extent of the Russian leader’s plans. “It’s very possible that Putin lied to them, the same way he lied to Europeans and others,” he said.

Mr. Xi has met with Mr. Putin 38 times as national leaders, more than with any other head of state, and the two share a drive to weaken American power.

Traditionally, China has bought military equipment from Russia rather than the other way around. Russia has increased its sales of weaponry to China in recent years. But China has advanced missile and drone capabilities that Russia could use in its Ukraine campaign.

Although Russia on Sunday launched a missile barrage on a military training ground in western Ukraine that killed at least 35 people, there has been some evidence that Russian missile supplies have been running low, according to independent analysts.

Last week, the White House criticized China for helping spread Kremlin disinformation about the United States and Ukraine. In recent days, Chinese diplomats, state media organizations and government agencies have used a range of platforms and official social media accounts to amplify a conspiracy theory that says the Pentagon has been financing biological and chemical weapons labs in Ukraine. Right-wing political figures in the United States have also promoted the theory.

On Friday, Russia called a United Nations Security Council meeting to present its claims about the labs, and the Chinese ambassador to the U.N., Zhang Jun, supported his Russian counterpart.

“Now that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them,” Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, wrote on Twitter last Wednesday.

China is also involved in the Iran nuclear negotiations, which have stalled because of new demands from Russia on relief from the sanctions imposed by Western nations in response to the Ukraine war.

American officials are trying to determine to what degree China would support Russia’s position in those talks. Before Russia raised the requests, officials from the nations involved had been close to clinching a return to a version of the Obama-era nuclear limits agreement from which President Donald J. Trump withdrew. Mr. Sullivan might bring up Iran with Mr. Yang on Monday.

Current and former U.S. officials say the Rome meeting is important, given the lives at stake in the Ukraine war and the possibility of Russia and China presenting a geopolitical united front against the United States and its allies in the years ahead.

“This meeting is critical and possibly a defining moment in the relationship,” said Evan Medeiros, a Georgetown University professor who was a senior Asia director on the National Security Council during the Obama administration.

“I think what the U.S. is probably going to do is lay out the costs and consequences of China’s complicity and possible enabling of Russia’s invasion,” he said. “I don’t think anyone in the administration has illusions that the U.S. can pull China away from Russia.”

Some U.S. officials are looking for ways to compel Mr. Xi to distance himself from Mr. Putin on the war. Others see Mr. Xi as a lost cause and prefer to treat China and Russia as committed partners, hoping that might galvanize policies and coordination among Asian and European allies to contain them both.

Chinese officials have consistently voiced sympathy for Russia during the Ukraine war by reiterating Mr. Putin’s criticism of NATO and blaming the United States for starting the conflict. They have refrained from any mention of a Russian “war” or “invasion,” even as they express general concern for the humanitarian crisis.

They mention support for “sovereignty and territorial integrity,” a common catchphrase in Chinese diplomacy, but do not say explicitly which nation’s sovereignty they support — meaning the phrase could be interpreted as backing for Ukraine or an endorsement of Mr. Putin’s claims to restoring the territory of imperial Russia.

China and Russia issued a 5,000-word statement on Feb. 4 saying their partnership had “no limits” when Mr. Putin met with Mr. Xi before the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics in Beijing. Around that time, senior Chinese officials asked senior Russian officials not to invade Ukraine before the end of the Games, according to U.S. and European officials who cite a Western intelligence report.

Starting last November, American officials quietly held talks with Chinese officials, including the ambassador in Washington and the foreign minister, to discuss intelligence showing Mr. Putin’s troop buildup to persuade the Chinese to tell the Russians not to launch a war, U.S. officials said. The Chinese officials rebuffed the Americans at every meeting and expressed skepticism that Mr. Putin intended to invade Ukraine, the U.S. officials said.

William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director, said on Thursday in a Senate hearing that he believed Mr. Xi was “unsettled” by the Ukraine war.

Last Tuesday, Mr. Xi repeated China’s standard talking points on the war in a video call with the leaders of France and Germany. He also said that all nations should show “maximum restraint” and that China was “deeply grieved by the outbreak of war again on the European continent,” according to a Chinese readout. He did not say Russia had started the fighting.

U.S. and European officials say large Chinese companies will most likely refrain from openly violating sanctions on Russia for fear of jeopardizing their global commerce. On Thursday, some Russian news articles and commentary questioned China’s commitment to Russia after news agencies reported that China was refusing to send aircraft parts to the country.

Russia, as U.S. officials often remind the public, has relatively few friends or allies. And officials have said Russia’s outreach to its partners is a sign of the difficulties it is encountering in trying to subdue Ukraine.

As the United States and Europe have increased pressure and sanctions, Moscow has sought more aid.

In the buildup to war, Russia got assistance from Belarus, using its territory to launch part of the invasion. Minsk has also tried to help Moscow evade sanctions. Those actions prompted the European Union to impose sanctions on Belarus. The penalties limit money flowing into Belarus from Europe and block some Belarusian banks from using the SWIFT financial messaging system.

Michael Carpenter, the U.S. ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, accused Belarus of being a “co-aggressor” and having “stabbed your neighbor in the back,” referring to Ukraine.

President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus has said his military will not join in the war. But Russia has launched missiles from Belarus and evacuated some injured Russian soldiers to hospitals in that country.

President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, who owes his government’s survival to Russian intervention in the Syrian civil war, also declared support for Moscow’s invasion. Russia has tried to recruit Syrian fighters to join the Ukraine war, according to the Pentagon.

While there are no details of how many recruits Moscow has enlisted or if they have arrived in Ukraine, American officials said Russia’s efforts were an indicator of the strategic and tactical problems that have plagued its commanders.

Before the start of the war, European officials said, Russian military contractors with experience fighting in Syria and Libya secretly entered eastern Ukraine to help lay the groundwork for the invasion.",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/03/13/world/ukraine-russia-war

Ukraine's deputy defense minister said Monday that Russian forces were attempting to establish a ""corridor"" around the Ukrainian capital to block supply routes, amid continued fighting around Kyiv's suburbs.

""The enemy is trying to make a corridor around Kyiv and block transport routes,"" said Hanna Maliar, Ukraine's Deputy Defense Minister, in televised remarks.

""The defense of Kyiv continues. Ground forces, Air Assault Forces, special operations forces, territorial defense are involved. Kyiv residents are also very active in the defense of Kyiv.

""Over the past 24 hours, there have been more than 40 incidents of shelling by Russian troops of housing estates and social infrastructure,"" the statement said.

Clarissa Ward, CNN’s chief international correspondent who has been reporting on the ground in Ukraine since Russian forces invaded the country more than a month ago, helped Trey Yingst of Fox News locate the bodies of cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski and fixer Oleksandra “Sasha” Kuvshynova.

Ward and Yingst made frantic phone calls to Ukrainian officials from a Kyiv hotel room seeking information about the whereabouts of Zakrzewski and Kuvshynova, the Wall Street Journal reported.

The two wartime correspondents called local morgues and hospitals in hopes of getting confirmation as to the condition and whereabouts of the Fox News employees.

Ward and Yingst also provided Ukrainian military and government officials with information about the missing journalists, the Journal reported.

Security personnel from Sky News and NBC also offered assistance to Fox News, according to the report.

Zakrzewski and Kuvshynova were killed in the same March 14 attack outside Kyiv that injured one of the network’s top correspondents, Benjamin Hall.

Zakrzewski, 55, and Kuvshynova, 24, were with Hall when their vehicle came under fire in Horenka, a northwest suburb of Kyiv, Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott said in a statement.

Hall — who was “extremely close” to Zakrzewski, according to a colleague — was hurt in the attack and hospitalized. He sustained severe leg injuries caused by shrapnel.

Last week, Fox News announced that Hall was airlifted stateside and had undergone several surgeries at a military hospital in Texas.

“Yesterday Ben was transferred from Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany to Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC), located at Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston, Texas,” Scott told staffers in an internal memo on Friday.

“BAMC is a premier military medical facility and Ben is receiving excellent care while he continues to recover from his serious injuries after multiple surgeries.”

In total, five journalists — two Ukrainians and three foreigners — have died while covering the Russian invasion of Ukraine, according to the international NGO Reporters Without Borders.

Brent Renaud, a 51-year-old American documentary filmmaker who had worked with the New York Times on several occasions in the past, was fatally shot in the neck while driving his car in Irpin, a town northwest of Kyiv, on March 13.

Juan Arredondo, a dual American-Colombian national who was with Renaud in the car, was wounded in the attack.

The bombing of a maternity hospital that buried children in rubble. The death of Boris Romantschenko, who survived Nazi concentration camps only to be killed at 96 by a Russian missile strike in Kharkiv.

Those tragedies are balanced by stories of Ukrainian triumph, its military and civilians showing tremendous resilience against the Russian army's onslaught, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy famously rejecting a U.S. evacuation offer saying ""The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride.""

These stories have galvanized the world in opposition to the naked aggression of Russian President Vladimir Putin. But they are coming at a tremendous cost for the journalists on the ground at the center of the conflict. Five journalists have been killed since the start of the conflict:

Yevhenii Sakun, 49, was a camera operator for Ukraine's LIVE station. He died March 1 when a TV tower in Kyiv was hit by Russian shelling;

Brent Renaud, a 50-year-old American filmmaker working for Time magazine, was killed March 13 when Russian soldiers opened fire on the car he was traveling in outside Kyiv.

Oleksandra Kuvshynova, 24, was a producer and consultant for Fox News, helping teams navigate the area and speak with sources. She was shot and killed March 14.

Pierre Zakrzewski, a 55-year-old cameraman for Fox, was traveling with Kuvshynova in the town of Horenka when their vehicle was attacked. Another Fox journalist, Benjamin Hall, was severely injured.

Oksana Baulina, a reporter for the Insider, an independent Russian news site, was killed March 23 while filming Russian shelling in Kyiv.

They all died giving a voice to those most affected by the barbarity. Each knew the dangers of their profession but entered the war zone in search of the truth. Because make no mistake, this is as much a war of misinformation and lies as a missiles and bullets. The Putin regime has clamped down on the Russian press while stepping up misinformation efforts in the Ukraine, the rest of Europe and abroad, including here in America. The journalists who gave their lives — and those who continue to report from the war zones — sought to provide an antidote to a despot's lies.

Story continues

""The truth is the target,"" Ukraine's Ministry of Defense said of the attack that struck the Fox News team, referencing Putin's attempt to silence his country's media. And the Committee to Protect Journalists described Russia's actions as ""reckless"" and demanded the country's army ""stop targeting media facilities and equipment.""

Baulina sought to bring unflinching, accurate reporting to her fellow Russians, and had worked previously at the Anti-Corruption Foundation, which was founded by top Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. Her work, and the work of countless others in the Ukraine, have laid bare Putin's lies and brought the horrors of war to light for the rest of the world.

The latest victim was one of the few Russian journalists in Ukraine, Oksana Baulina. She was killed in the capital, Kyiv, on 23 March by a “kamikaze drone” – an aerial combat drone containing an explosive, according to her news organisation, the Latvian-based Russian online investigative media outlet The Insider.

At the time, she was reporting on the damage caused by a previous strike on a shopping centre in Podil, a suburb of Kyiv. For security reasons, she was accompanied at the time by two police officers, who were injured in the attack. She had recently conducted interviews with Russian soldiers captured by the Ukrainian army in Lviv – interviews that have not yet been published.

“A quarter of the journalists killed since the start of the year worldwide have died in the past 30 days while covering the war in Ukraine,” said Jeanne Cavelier, the head of RSF’s Eastern Europe and Central Asia desk. “As their reporting is essential in order to understand the war in Ukraine, and attacking journalists is a war crime under international law, we call on the Russian and Ukrainian authorities to guarantee their safety on the ground.”

Two journalists were killed when artillery fire targeted a crew with the US TV channel Fox News in Horenka, near, Kyiv, on 14 March. They were Pierre Zakrzewski, a 55-year-old cameraman who was used to covering wars, and Olexandra Kuvshynova, a 24-year-old Ukrainian journalist working for Fox News as a fixer. British journalist Benjamin Hall sustained serious leg injuries from shrapnel in the same attack.

Brent Renaud, a 51-year-old US documentary filmmaker who had worked with the New York Times on several occasions in the past, was shot in the back of the neck while driving his car in Irpin, a town northwest of Kyiv, on 13 March. Juan Arredondo, a US-Colombian reporter who was with him, was injured and hospitalised. Together, they had been filming Kyiv residents leaving en masse for other regions.

The war’s first media fatality was Evgeny Sakun, a Ukrainian cameraman working for the local Kyiv Live TV channel, who was killed when Russian missiles hit the Kyiv television tower on 1 March.

RSF has been keeping a tally of attacks and other abuses against journalists since the start of the war in Ukraine. In addition to the five killed, nine other journalists have been injured by gunfire, missiles or artillery fire, and local journalists are being subjected to a great deal of harassment in the occupied zones.

Romania’s health minister has said the country would distribute potassium iodine tablets free of charge to prepare in case of a nuclear emergency amid Russia’s invasion of neighbouring Ukraine.

European countries have seen stocks of iodine fly off the shelves due to fears it may be needed to counter the risks of thyroid cancer if Russia’s invasion of Ukraine causes a nuclear incident.

Health Minister Alexandru Rafila said the government would start distributing the tablets from next week through family doctors though he warned they should not be taken preventively.

“They should be taken if there is a nuclear incident in the vicinity. Otherwise, they should not be taken,” he told reporters.

The ministry will also launch an information campaign to guide the population on how to obtain the pills, how to store them and how to administer them.

Rafila said a nuclear incident was “not probable” but “possible”.

“We cannot absolutely rule it out … We have to prepare for such a situation,” he said, adding the pills had a shelf-life of three years.

Several doctors have warned of the dangers of taking iodine without proper precautions, pointing at the serious side effects.

International health authorities say the tablets must be taken at precise times just before or after exposure with an incident occurring within a distance of some 20 kilometres.

They are recommended in particular for pregnant women, babies, children and young people.",https://www.thejournal.ie/ukraine-latest-developments-4-5723828-Mar2022/
