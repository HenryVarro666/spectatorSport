As recently as a year ago, many Americans did not know what to make of Ukraine — if they knew anything about it at all. One-third of voters couldn’t say whether it was friendly or unfriendly to the U.S.

Not anymore.

In a striking — if perhaps not surprising — shift over the last year and since Russia’s invasion, an overwhelming majority of Americans now say Ukraine is a friendly country. In a new YouGov survey, 81 percent of Americans say Ukraine is either friendly or an ally, a figure that rivals or even exceeds that of many longtime U.S. allies like France or Japan. Only Britain, Canada and Australia earned more favorable ratings from voters.

YouGov, an online polling firm, has tracked the American public’s views on dozens of countries since 2017.

In recent years, American attitudes toward Ukraine have shifted more than toward any other country. When the poll tested U.S. attitudes on Ukraine in September 2019, 36 percent of registered voters were not sure whether Ukraine was friendly or unfriendly. That’s a higher share than for nearly any of the other thousands of instances when YouGov asked voters what they thought about a country over the last five years. Only 41 percent called the nation friendly or an ally.

Now, only 10 percent aren’t sure whether Ukraine is friendly, a lower tally than for almost any other country.

Nearly 70 percent of Americans now consider Russia an enemy, more than for any other country in the survey, including North Korea and Iran.

The United States has been racing to support the Ukrainian war effort, including a $13.6 billion spending plan passed all but unanimously by the House this week.

But exuberant public support for Ukraine has limits. Just 29 percent of voters characterized Ukraine as an ally, a figure that's considerably lower than what the survey found for every ally with which the U.S. has a formal treaty, other than Turkey. It's more like the 26 percent who said the same about Taiwan (in late 2021), whose relationship with the U.S. is intentionally ambiguous.

The Biden administration has said it is unwilling to intervene directly militarily because of the risk of a war with Russia. Polls show that voters overwhelmingly do not support direct military intervention either.

It is not clear whether the public understanding of Ukraine as a friendly but not allied country is partly because of the public's skepticism of intervention, or because the administration has been clear about the limits of the U.S. commitment to Ukraine’s defense.",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/12/upshot/ukraine-russia-ally-enemy.html

The survey, conducted by Gallup, showed only 15 percent of Americans viewed Russia favorably, while 85 percent said their views of Russia were unfavorable. The poll, conducted over the first two weeks of February, came as Russia positioned tens of thousands of soldiers around Ukraine, poised for the invasion that began on Feb. 24.

Attitudes toward Russia have soured in recent years, after American intelligence agencies accused Putin’s own intelligence services of interfering in American elections. As recently as 2016, before the presidential election, 30 percent of Americans saw Russia favorably; near the end of the Cold War, in 1991, as many as two-thirds of Americans viewed Russia in a favorable light.

Almost two thirds of Americans said they viewed Ukraine in a favorable light, even before the invasion and President Volodymyr Zelensky’s sudden emergence as a Churchillian figure opposing the Russian invaders.

Americans see Canada more favorably than any other nation. Nearly nine in 10 surveyed, 87 percent, view our neighbors to the north in a positive light, though Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say nice things about Canadians; 95 percent of Democrats see Canada favorably, compared with 80 percent of Republicans.

More than 80 percent of Americans have favorable views of Great Britain (86 percent), France (84 percent) and Japan (82 percent). More than 70 percent say the same of Germany (78 percent), India (77 percent) and Israel (71 percent).

On the other end of the spectrum, nations like Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan and North Korea have the worst ratings, alongside Russia. Fewer than one in five Americans have favorable views of any of those nations.

Democrats are more likely to hold favorable opinions of foreign nations than Republicans; three-quarters of Democrats view Mexico favorably, while only half of Republicans say the same. Large partisan gaps exist over Cuba, France and Germany, too. While a quarter of Democrats view China favorably, just 13 percent of Republicans said the same.

The lone exception is Israel, of which 80 percent of Republicans and just 65 percent of Democrats hold favorable views.

Americans’ views of China have cratered in recent years, a slide that began before the pandemic and hastened after the coronavirus emerged from the Chinese city of Wuhan. As recently as 2018, half of Americans, 53 percent, said they viewed China favorably; today, just 20 percent say the same.

To conduct the poll, Gallup surveyed 1,008 Americans over the age of 18 between February 1-17. The poll carried a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.",https://thehill.com/policy/international/598096-fewer-americans-see-russia-favorably-than-ever-before-poll/

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

How you can help: Here are ways those in the U.S. can help support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.

Americans rate Canada and Great Britain the most favorably and Iran and Russia among the least favorably in a survey of 19 countries, Gallup reports.

The annual World Affairs poll, conducted before Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, found that Americans ranked North Korea, Afghanistan, Iran, Russia and Iraq all under 20 percent favorable ratings.

Canada, Great Britain, France and Japan were all rated favorably by more than 80 percent of Americans surveyed, the top four of the 19 countries in the poll.

Six more countries were rated favorably by the majority of respondents when they were surveyed from Feb. 1 to Feb. 17: Germany, India, Israel, Egypt, Mexico and Ukraine.

China, Iraq, Russia, Iran, Afghanistan and North Korea received favorability ratings of 20 percent or less.

A minority, but higher than 20 percent, found Cuba, Saudi Arabia and the Palestinian Authority favorable.

Gallup has tracked the favorable ratings of 18 out of the 19 countries for decades, adding Ukraine in 2022 as Russia began building up troops at its border.

Multiple countries were rated less favorably by respondents compared to data from last year, including Afghanistan, Russia, Cuba, Iraq, Germany, Canada, Great Britain and China.

Afghanistan fell from 21 percent to a record low of 12 percent, while Russia fell from 22 percent to 15 percent.

China retained its record low rating of 20 percent after dropping significantly in the aftermath of the onset of COVID-19.

India also retained its rating from last year, which was a record high of 77 percent.

Ratings of Cuba, Iraq, Canada and Great Britain dropped by 5 percentage points, while ratings of Germany dropped by 6 percentage points.

However, the ratings of U.S. allies Canada, Great Britain and Germany remain high, at 87 percent, 86 percent and 78 percent, respectively.

No country's rating increased from 2021 to 2022.",https://news.yahoo.com/canada-great-britain-top-us-210516903.html/src/lib/lang_list.json
