The ongoing conflict has the potential to affect the stability and security of the whole region and Turkish officials have made numerous calls to stop the aggression. Ankara has repeatedly deemed the Russian invasion of Ukraine ""unacceptable"" and offered to mediate between Moscow and Kyiv.

“On the fourth day of the Ukraine war, we repeat President Erdoğan’s call for an immediate halt of Russian attacks and the start of cease-fire negotiations,” Presidential Spokesperson Ibrahim Kalın said on Sunday.

“We will continue our efforts to help the people of Ukraine and end bloodshed in this unjust and unlawful war,” he underlined on Twitter.

Communications Director Fahrettin Altun similarly said that Turkey believes in the constructive and creative power of diplomacy, underlining that the country tries to exhaust all diplomatic options in every crisis.

“This latest conflict is both unfortunate and unnecessary. We will try to prevent this war’s immediate and long-term consequences,” he said on Twitter.

In light of the speculation and commentary about Turkey’s policy in the face of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Altun said: “Everyone should be assured that Turkey’s diplomatic actions and coordination with allies will always focus on how to achieve a quick and peaceful resolution of the conflict.”

Meanwhile, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan held a phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday. In the call, Erdoğan offered his condolences over the loss of lives in the Russian attack and wished a speedy recovery to the wounded.

Erdoğan said Turkey was pushing for the declaration of an immediate cease-fire ""to prevent further loss of life and prevent further damage to Ukraine,"" according to the Turkish Presidency, but did not mention the Black Sea. Kyiv has asked Ankara to block any Russian warships from reaching the Black Sea, from where Moscow launched one of its incursions on Ukraine's southern coast.

Zelenskyy, for his part, thanked Erdoğan for Turkey's humanitarian and military support, adding that a ""ban on the passage of (Russian) warships to the Black Sea"" was very important for his country. Turkey, which controls the Dardanelles and Bosporus straits that link the Mediterranean to the Black Sea, has not publicly announced a ban on Russian warships despite Ukraine's urgent requests that it do so, with Turkish officials anonymously speaking to the media denying the closure.

Russia has received no official notification from Turkey on the closure of the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits to Russian warships, the Interfax news agency quoted the Russian Embassy in Turkey as saying.

Under the 1936 Montreux Convention, Turkey has control over the Bosporus and Daradanelles connecting the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. While trade ships may pass the strait freely in peacetime, battleships face certain restrictions.

Kyiv's ambassador to Ankara, Vasyl Bodnar, on Thursday officially requested that Turkey close the straits to Russian ships.

Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu on Friday said that under the 1936 convention, Ankara could not bar warships from returning to their home bases in the Black Sea, where Russia has a major naval base. On the same day, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the Bosporus was not among the topics discussed at a leaders' summit.

As the intense diplomatic traffic striving for a peaceful solution continued, Çavuşoğlu asked his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, to call off the attack on Ukraine during a phone call on Saturday. Çavuşoğlu told Lavrov that further military escalation would not benefit anyone and reiterated Turkey's ""readiness to host negotiations that could take place between the Russian Federation and Ukraine."" A day earlier, Çavuşoğlu had also called Russia’s call for a coup unacceptable after Russian President Vladimir Putin called on the Ukrainian military to remove the country's leadership. On the Russian side, Moscow is ready to work closely with all constructive forces for the resolution of the Ukrainian crisis in the interests of peace and stability, the Interfax news agency quoted Lavrov as saying.

Meanwhile, Defense Minister Hulusi Akar also discussed the Russian invasion with his Ukrainian counterpart Oleksii Reznikov over the phone Saturday.

A statement published by the ministry said the defense chiefs discussed the latest situation in Ukraine, with Akar stressing that Turkey is ready to support Ukraine with humanitarian aid and continue to do its part to ensure peace in the region, as it has done before.

Turkey’s efforts

Turkey has found itself in a balancing act between Russia and Ukraine given the friendly ties and Black Sea maritime boundaries it shares with both parties. NATO member Turkey also has good economic and political relations with both countries and Erdoğan earlier last week said Ankara did not want to alienate either state.

Turkey has offered to mediate the crisis and had earlier warned Russia not to invade Ukraine. Ankara has been closely following the developments and is in close contact with both Kyiv and Moscow. While forging cooperation on defense and energy, Turkey has opposed Moscow’s policies in Syria and Libya, as well as its annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. It has also sold sophisticated drones to Ukraine, angering Russia. Turkey also strongly opposed Russia’s recognition of Ukraine’s breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

While Turkey’s call for mediation and its offer to host a Minsk group meeting in Istanbul was welcomed by Ukraine, Russia held back from officially accepting the offer.

""We have repeatedly called for a diplomatic solution, but the war is a reality right now. The international community’s lack of unity over a number of regional and global issues has been a major problem just like it has over the Russia-Ukraine crisis,"" Altun said.

""As Turkey, we have done everything we can to prevent this at the diplomatic level,"" the communications chief said, adding that the country's calls to reform the U.N. system have failed to be heard and ""we have seen the dire consequences in this latest crisis.""

""This war could have been prevented if our calls were heeded,” he added. ""We are witnessing yet another war in our region.""",https://www.dailysabah.com/politics/diplomacy/turkey-urges-russia-to-halt-attacks-on-ukraine-calls-for-talks

Ukraine has said it would hold talks with Russia at its border with Belarus, near the Chernobyl exclusion zone, after a phone call between President Volodymyr Zelensky and Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko.

“The politicians agreed that the Ukrainian delegation would meet the Russian one without preconditions at the Ukraine-Belarus border, near the Pripyat River,” Zelensky’s office said in a statement.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said that a Russian delegation was currently in the Belarusian city of Gomel. Zelensky previously suggested that negotiations could be held in Istanbul, Warsaw, Bratislava, Budapest or Baku.

“Warsaw, Bratislava, Budapest, Istanbul, Baku. We proposed all of them,” Zelensky said earlier on Feb. 27 in an address posted online.

Zelensky stressed that Russia has been carrying out some of its attacks on Ukraine from Belarus, therefore he is open to talks only in locations that are “not showing aggression” toward his country.

“And any other city in a country from whose territory missiles do not fly would suit us,” he stated.

Meanwhile, Turkey has attempted again to host talks for a possible ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine and held phone diplomacy with both countries at the weekend.

Turkey has been making efforts for a ceasefire between Moscow and Kyiv, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan told his Ukrainian counterpart in a phone call on Feb. 26. The president offered his condolences to Ukrainian citizens killed in Russia’s attack and wished a speedy recovery to the wounded, said the presidency.

He reiterated Turkey’s “readiness to host negotiations that could take place between the Russian Federation and Ukraine,” said sources from the Turkish Foreign Ministry. Çavuşoğlu also asked Lavrov to end the military operation in Ukraine. The minister told Lavrov that the further escalation of military tensions would not benefit anyone.

Defense Minister Hulusi Akar and his Ukrainian counterpart, Oleksii Reznikov, also discussed over the phone the latest developments in Ukraine. The Turkish minister said Turkey would continue to do its part on humanitarian aid for the Ukrainians.

Turkey’s Presidential Spokesperson İbrahim Kalın also released a message, saying: “On the fourth day of the Ukraine war, we repeat President [Recep Tayyip] Erdoğan’s call for an immediate halt of Russian attacks and the start of ceasefire negotiations.”

Fahrettin Altun, Turkey’s communications director, said that Turkey did everything to prevent the war at the diplomatic level, but calls for reform in the U.N. system were ignored.

“We have seen the dire consequences in this latest crisis. This war could have been prevented if our calls were heeded,” he added.

“We have repeatedly called for a diplomatic solution, but the war is a reality right now. The international community’s lack of unity over a number of regional and global issues has been a major problem just like it has over the Russia-Ukraine crisis,” he stated.

Zelensky calls for ban on Russian warships in Turkish straits

Zelensky reiterated his country’s call to Turkey for closing the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits to the passage of Russian warships.

“I thank my friend Mr. President of [Turkey] @RTErdogan and the people of [Turkey] for their strong support. The ban on the passage of [Russian] warships to the Black Sea and significant military and humanitarian support for [Ukraine] are extremely important today. The people of [Ukraine] will never forget that!” he tweeted on Feb. 26.

Turkey had earlier offered to mediate between Moscow and Kiev even before Russia attacked Ukraine. Erdoğan earlier invited both Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin for a face-to-face summit in Istanbul.

Kyiv had appealed to Ankara to block any more Russian ships from entering the Black Sea, from which Moscow launched an incursion on Ukraine's southern coast. At least six Russian warships and a submarine transited Turkey's straits this month.

""It is not a couple of air strikes now, the situation in Ukraine is officially a war... We will implement the Montreux Convention,"" Mevlut Cavusoglu, Turkey's foreign minister, said in an interview with broadcaster CNN Turk.

Balancing its Western commitments and close ties to Moscow, Ankara has in recent days called the Russian attack unacceptable but until Sunday had not described the situation in Ukraine as a war. read more

The rhetorical shift allows Turkey to enact the articles of the 1936 Montreux Convention that permits it to limit naval transit of its Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits during wartime, or if threatened. read more

Yet Cavusoglu reiterated that Turkey cannot block all Russian warships accessing the Black Sea due to a clause in the pact exempting those returning to their registered base.

""There should not be any abuse of this exemption. Ships that declare returning to their bases and passing through the straits should not be involved in the war,"" Cavusoglu said.

Turkey has good ties with Russia and Ukraine. Even as NATO members have hit Moscow with sanctions, any step too far by Ankara could harm its heavy Russian energy imports, trade and tourism sector at a time of domestic economic turmoil.

Cavusoglu also said he spoke to both Ukrainian and Russian counterparts and was pleased to hear that two countries will hold negotiations.

Turkey said it was exerting extensive efforts to halt Russian military operations in Ukraine, reiterating its offer to mediate between Moscow and Kyiv.

In a phone call on Saturday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky that Ankara was trying to work towards the declaration of an immediate ceasefire “to prevent further loss of life and damage to Ukraine,” the Turkish presidency said.

Also, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu asked his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov to end the attack on Ukraine during a phone call on Saturday.

Cavusoglu told Lavrov that further military escalation would not benefit anyone.

Meanwhile, the Council of Europe on Friday said it was suspending all representatives of Russia from participating in the pan-European rights body’s Committee of Ministers and its parliament over Moscow’s attack on Ukraine.

The 47-nation Council of Europe said in a statement it decided to suspend the rights of representation of Russia from the committee and the assembly “with immediate effect.”

Turkey abstained during the vote. However, it has repeatedly called the Russian invasion of Ukraine “unacceptable.”

In a televised interview late on Friday, Cavusoglu said: “We don’t want to cut off the dialogue” with Russia, on which it is highly dependent for energy supplies.

Erdogan accuses NATO and the European Union of failing to take a “determined stance” on the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

“NATO should have taken a more decisive step,” Erdogan told reporters.

“The EU and other pro-Western [bodies] have failed to take a serious and determined stance at the moment. They are all providing Ukraine with plenty of advice.”

Ukraine asked Turkey on Thursday to close the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits to Russian ships.

Under the 1936 Montreux Convention, Ankara has control over the straits and can limit warship passages during wartime or if threatened.

Cavusoglu said Turkey was studying Kyiv’s request but said Russia had the right under the Convention to return ships to their home base, in this case the Black Sea.

Turkey on Sunday requested from Russia and Ukraine a humanitarian truce that would allow Ankara and other countries to evacuate their citizens from Ukrainian combat zones.

Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu spoke by phone Sunday with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov and Ukraine’s Dmytro Kuleba on the latest developments in Ukraine.

He mainly requested a possible cease-fire and discussed the humanitarian situation, including the evacuation of civilians, according to a briefing by the Foreign Ministry.

Meanwhile, Ankara renewed its calls for Russia to end its attacks on Ukraine and start negotiations.

“On the fourth day of the Ukraine war, we repeat President (Recep Tayyip) Erdogan’s call for an immediate halt of Russian attacks and the start of ceasefire negotiations. We will continue our efforts to help the people of Ukraine and end bloodshed in this unjust and unlawful war,” presidential spokesperson Ibrahim Kalin said on Twitter.

Ankara then stressed that the two straits of Bosporus and Dardanelles are still open to Russian ships and that it has not changed its decision to implement the 1936 Montreux Convention, which allows Turkey the power to regulate the transit of naval warships in the Black Sea through the two straits.

In a television interview, Cavusoglu said that Article 19 of the Convention is clear concerning allowing the warships of littoral states to return to their base.

He added, “It is not a couple of airstrikes now, the situation in Ukraine is officially a war… We will implement the Montreux Convention.”

Meanwhile, the Coastal Safety Istanbul Office directory said on Sunday that the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits are still open to Russian ships, and that it did not receive any government decision to the contrary.

Late on Saturday, Zelensky thanked the Turkish President for banning passage of Russian warships to the Black Sea.

“The ban on the passage of Russian warships to the Black Sea and significant military and humanitarian support for Ukraine are extremely important today,” Zelensky tweeted.
