The relevant statement was made by Kharkiv Regional Military Administration Head Oleh Syniehubov on Telegram, an Ukrinform correspondent reports.

“Talking of Kharkiv, last night the city came under fire 24 times. It is relatively low, but each time may cause casualties among civilians. Yesterday there were quite many casualties,” Syniehubov told.

Over the past day, no enemy aircrafts have been recorded over Kharkiv. Meanwhile, reconnaissance drones were detected, and some of them were destroyed by the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

According to Syniehubov, the Ukrainian military are not only keeping the defense lines in Kharkiv Region but also launching counterattacks. In particular, several settlements in the direction of Mala Rohan have been liberated, and battles are currently underway there. Battles are also raging in the Izium direction.

A reminder that, on February 24, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin initiated a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, starting a war. Russian troops are shelling and destroying the key infrastructure facilities, launching missile and air strikes on Ukrainian cities and villages, killing civilians.

Russian forces are firing at a nuclear research facility in the city of Kharkiv, the Ukrainian parliament said in a Twitter post on Saturday.

“It is currently impossible to estimate the extent of damage due to hostilities that do not stop in the area of the nuclear installation,” the post quoted the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate as saying.

The inspectorate’s website did not contain any news about the attack.

Earlier this month, the grounds of the Institute of Physics and Technology were hit by Russian shells. At the time, the facility’s director general said the core housing nuclear fuel remained intact.

Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, has seen some of the worst bombing since the conflict began on Feb. 24.

Then, 10 days into the war, with no notice, their home was ripped apart and its contents hurled on top of the family. One minute they were cooking dinner, the next Diana was sprawled on the ground, bleeding so much from a head injury that her mother, Victoria, feared the 18-year-old was slipping away.

A rocket had slammed into the neighbouring high-rise, and the force of the blast had lifted a door off its hinges and slammed it into the side of Diana’s head. When an ambulance rushed her to hospital – emergency services are braving shelling to pick up the injured – doctors were able to save her life, but not her left eye.

“It is very difficult for me to talk about that time because she was dying,” Victoria said from her daughter’s bedside as the thud of artillery echoed in the background. “I’ve got used to the bombing now, it’s not scary after what I’ve lived through. I watched my child almost die.

“I’m just very happy she is alive, she lived, and she understands everything. Her brain could have been damaged. It is a miracle.”

Scores of people are thought to have been killed and thousands injured by Russian attacks in Kharkiv, scene of some of the worst devastation of the war outside besieged Mariupol.

Just about 25 miles from the Russian border, locals say the city is being is being punished for its resilience after it held off Russian forces in the first days of the invasion.

Because it cannot rout Ukraine’s soldiers there, Moscow has turned its long-range artillery on civilians such as Diana, who now are filling Kharkiv’s hospital beds or the corridors of its morgues.

Here, the war is in the heart of the city, every day. A missile ripped into city hall, rockets punch gaping holes in the elegant central streets, and the outlying residential neighbourhoods bear the deadliest toll.

On Thursday six civilians were killed by a rocket while they were queueing for humanitarian aid outside a post office. One had been sleeping in the metro station for safety and had come up for some fresh air, witnesses said. On Friday another four people died when a shell landed near a clinic.

Many, like the Zubchenckos, are hit in their homes where they have stayed to care for others too old or sick to move. Diana had refused to leave her 93-year-old grandfather, a double amputee.

“Life has changed completely, everything is divided between before and after the war. I have not left the hospital for 29 days,” said Oleksandr Dukhovsky, a paediatric neurosurgeon who was treating Diana. He had tended to more than 50 other children brought in with shelling, gunshot and other conflict injuries since the war began.

“My mum brought me up as a cynic, but this is very hard. It has brought me to tears,” he said of the terrible influx of young bodies battered by munitions. And that is only the toll in one department in one of the city’s many hospitals.

Authorities are reluctant to talk about how many people have been killed in Kharkiv. The regional governor, Oleh Synyehubov, put the official civilian death toll at more than 100, but said that 30 bodies had been retrieved from the wreckage of city hall alone and the actual total would be significantly higher.

“There are more,” he said in an interview. “We have the official data from hospitals, but there are places – homes, apartments – where firefighters have gone to put out fires after an attack, but they have not been able to retrieve bodies because the shelling is ongoing.”

One central morgue has run out of room indoors for victims – and coffins to hold their remains. Dozens of bodies were lined up in a courtyard, some tied in plastic bags, others wrapped in blankets, and on a sunny afternoon this week vans carrying new bodies arrived about every five minutes.

Even as hospitals in the city try to staunch the loss, they fear becoming part of it, after attacks on more than 40 healthcare facilities around the country, including the Mariupol maternity hospital. Many hospitals declined interviews, fearing it would expose their patients to greater risks.

At Dukhovsky’s hospital, which the Guardian is not naming, the windows were covered in blackout blinds, many of the patients were in corridors rather than on wards, the sound of artillery was constant, and there had been a gun battle nearby last week.

The strict city curfew – from 6pm to 6am – and the intensity of Russian attacks mean most of the doctors and nurses treating Diana and her fellow patients have been living at the hospital since the war began, their ordinary lives suspended overnight.

“It’s too hard to find words to describe what is happening in this city,” said Lydmila Ivanova, 68, a senior nurse on the trauma ward. “Who was the church bothering, who was the zoo bothering? It was such a beautiful place, who would attack it in this way?”

Her years of experience dealing with car accidents and violence had not prepared her for the horrors of Vladimir Putin’s bombardment. “It is very difficult to bear with the small children coming in,” she said.

The ward had only about one-third of its normal staff; some were trapped behind enemy lines, others had decided to leave Kharkiv. So, in addition to nursing, they were all pitching in with cleaning and cooking.

“We have a shower here, and a place to wash clothes, and my children have brought me some supplies,” she said. Hospital staff see their work as part of the war effort, they say, and are kept going in part by the gratitude of patients and relatives who have also moved in to help with care.

“I bow down on my knees to the doctors and the nurses for not leaving and not going home, and dedicating themselves to saving lives,” said Victoria, Diana’s mother. “The Russians can’t defeat this country. You can see, everyone is doing everything for us.”

She was confident that with their help her girl, a sporty, generous student who gave her allowance to charity and doted on their dog Archibald, would make a full recovery.

On the next floor down, Volodymyr, seven, was just coming round from brain surgery. His mumbled, fitful words sounded like a call for his mama. He had not yet been told that she was dead, killed in the first week of the war by the round of bullets that shattered his skull.

“He needs to be strong to make a full recovery so he can live a full life,” said his father, Stanislav Baclanov, 34. “If I tell him his mother has been killed, it will destroy his desire [to recover]. He must feel well, and after that I will tell him, and we will go to the cemetery together so I can show him her grave.”

Baclanov was stranded outside the country on a business trip when the war began, and when shelling intensified in their neighbourhood his wife, Darya, decided to take the children to a different part of the city.

He realised something was wrong when she stopped checking in, and his brother called to break the terrible news that the family had been gunned down near a checkpoint.

“Darya was like an angel in all her behaviour and love,” he said, his face gaunt and drawn with grief as he waited for his son to come out of surgery. “I can talk about my wife for a long time. She was a loving, open, intelligent, honest, bright person, my closest friend, a gentle flower. She was my sun.”

Volodymyr had major neurosurgery after the attack. This week Dukhovsky removed bone fragments and installed two titanium plates put in to protect his brain where the bone is missing, but he is expected to make a full recovery with proper medical care.

His father believes it was Ukrainians who opened fire by mistake, and wants the shooting investigated when the country is not consumed by war, he but said that whoever pulled the trigger, his wife’s death – and the family’s unbearable loss – should be counted as part of Russia’s toll in Kharkiv.

Chic eateries and sleek shopping malls sat alongside elegant neo-baroque architecture in what had been a rapidly developing urban centre.

Now, large areas of the city resemble Stalingrad more than Stuttgart, as Kharkiv falls victim to what locals and experts say is a Russian strategy of targeting civilians.

Entering the city from the south, there are initially few signs of the war, save the military barricades and checkpoints at regular intervals.

Downtown Kharkiv is a different story: windows and storefronts blown out by artillery shelling, other buildings demolished entirely by airstrikes or cruise missile hits.

Along Kharkiv's central Moskovsky Avenue, an apartment building scorched by rocket artillery fire sits across from a massive crater in a parking lot, the result of an airstrike the day prior to CBC's visit on Saturday.

""The rockets hit yesterday, and there was a huge fire in the apartment building,"" said Oleg Tornenko, a 55-year-old resident of the building.

""[The Russians] want people to leave here. They're trying to force them out.""

While most Russian shelling of Kharkiv to date has occurred during the evening, strikes in daylight hours have picked up in recent days, locals say.

""The last two or three days, they're bombing us during the day,"" said Elena Yelagina, a 62-year-old museum director who lives in the city centre.

""Not only by plane, but Grads (vehicle-mounted rocket launcher) and Smerch (rocket artillery), even Iskanders (ballistic missiles). I can already tell them apart just by the sound.""

'Every single day, something explodes'

The timing of the strikes appears designed to maximize civilian casualties and instill terror in the local population.

""This strike was at 8 a.m.,"" said Dmitri Yakovlev, a 26-year-old police officer, of the strike that hit the Moskovsky Ave. apartment building.

""Very often [Russian] shelling starts just after the curfew ends at 6 a.m. People go to queue for humanitarian aid, and they hit them.""

The strikes have been constant, and without apparent military goals.

""Every single day, something explodes,"" said Yakovlev. ""There are no military objects [in the city centre], only residential areas. They are intentionally shelling [civilians].""

Kharkiv is a key Russian prize in this war — a Russian-speaking city just 15 kilometres from the border. There were numerous Russia-backed attempts in 2014 to declare a ""Kharkiv People's Republic"" in the mould of those established in Donetsk and Luhansk, but the city has remained under Ukrainian government control.

Russian forces made numerous attempts to capture the city in the invasion's opening day, sending in lightly armoured special forces units in a bid to seize local government buildings.

Yakovlev, the police officer, witnessed some of those battles.

""They tried to break through in the first days, but too many of them died,"" he said.

""On Feb. 27, five Russian Tigr [armoured vehicles] broke into the city. One of them reached our [police] base — I think they were lost, because [the soldiers inside] just ran out and tried to hide in the nearby school.

""We captured one of the two that survived [the ensuing battle], who told us that he wanted to surrender earlier, but [Russian] commanders don't allow that.""

Following those failed incursions, Russian forces have made few attempts to breach the city, instead subjecting it to massive — and increasing — bombardment.

Russian strategy unclear

Experts say this is part of a shift in Moscow's strategy to focus more on siege warfare as its initial advances in Ukraine bog down.

Ukrainian forces have thus far managed to keep Russian troops on the outskirts of Kharkiv, after defeating the attempts in the war's opening days for a Russian ""thunder run"" to capture the city.

Russia, for its part, denies that its troops are even attacking Kharkiv, as foreign minister Sergei Lavrov stated on March 3.

""In some cases, it appears that Russian forces do not plan to take major cities like Kharkiv,"" said Michael Kofman, director of Russia studies at the Virginia-based Center for Naval Analyses.

""They lack the manpower for those assaults. Instead, they've been striking cities to apply pressure and signal to other towns that they're prepared to engage in indiscriminate shelling in order to coerce them into surrender.""

This strategy is also in play in other areas of Ukraine — particularly, the southeast city of Mariupol, where Russian forces are pounding the trapped civilians and defenders amid a grinding advance.

Officials in Mariupol say 80 per cent of the city's civilian infrastructure has been destroyed, including the Mariupol drama theatre, which was struck on March 16 despite housing more than 1,000 civilians who had taken shelter there and with the word ""children"" written in large Cyrillic script outside.

Others have confirmed Russia's intentionally destructive approach. Human Rights Watch found evidence of cluster munitions use in heavily populated areas of Kharkiv, where fewer than 500,000 civilians from a pre-war population of 1.5 million remain.

Kharkiv regional police said that between Feb. 24 and March 7, 133 civilians were killed in the city, with another 319 wounded.

'They won't beat us'

The results of Russia's tactics are evident across Kharkiv.

Moving northward from the city centre, it feels as if nearly every street is bombed out. Twisted rebar and blasted concrete dominate the cityscape for kilometres on end. The damage is so widespread that it's difficult to imagine what military purpose the Russians hoped to accomplish.

Yakovlev, the police officer, needs no more convincing of Russia's approach.

""After they failed to enter the city, they understood that they wouldn't be able to take [Kharkiv],"" he said.

""Their soldiers are far worse [fighters] than ours, and absolutely everyone here is against them. So they decided that instead, they would terrorize the civilians to make people leave.""

Fear, he believes, is the primary objective of these attacks.

""The only option Russia has is to just destroy the city, as they have done with Mariupol,"" Yakovlev said. ""So it's pure terror that they are using now.""

As he speaks, distant artillery thumps echo constantly, coming in small groups every few seconds. The tone of one group is different — lighter and without the change in air pressure.

""That was ours,"" said Yakovlev. ""They bomb us because they can't beat us. They won't beat us.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/kharkiv-ukraine-russian-bombardment-1.6396229

I was reloading my newsfeed again and again, reading increasingly disturbing news “the sky above all areas of the eastern Ukrainian border has been closed to flights”; “Russian diplomats have left their embassy in Ukraine in a hurry”. Hours were passing by. After updating my newsfeed once more, CCTV video footage popped up, showing tanks crossing one of the border checkpoints into Ukraine. “It has started” – messages were appearing one by one.

Just a few breaths after I saw the news, something started to explode loudly. At the same moment everyone in my home woke up in shock and disbelief. In matter of minutes, we took the two backpacks that had been prepared weeks ago “just in case”, dressed our sleepy daughter in a winter coat over her pyjamas and left our little family home without looking back. It was a very dark and foggy morning. A cup of tea I made in the early hours of the morning remained untouched on the table.

Even though the possibility of a Russian invasion had been discussed for months, people in Ukraine believed that an event like that would be impossible. And not just in Ukraine. It would lead to tremendous consequences that would affect not only my country, but also Russia as well, and so many other countries around the world. Surely, no-one would allow this to happen.

Even though the possibility of a Russian invasion had been discussed for months, people in Ukraine believed that an event like that would be impossible. And not just in Ukraine

For months, despite the disturbing news, people in Ukraine were trying to live their lives. However, it is easy to see now that all the signs of an imminent invasion had been developing rapidly.

In January 2022, Russia placed an estimated 100,000 troops, and military equipment near the Ukrainian border. It was claimed that these troops were participating in military exercises and were about to leave and go back to their bases soon.

On 15 February Russia’s State Duma asked President Vladimir Putin to recognize independence of the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, territories controlled by Russia-backed armed groups in the east of Ukraine.

Less than a week after that, Putin convened and chaired a televised meeting of Russia’s Security Council. At that meeting the members of the Council were asked, one by one, to express their opinion regarding the recognition of the “Republics”. Unsurprisingly, all of the members expressed their strong support, although some were visibly nervous.

On the same day, 21 February, in his televised address Putin stated that Ukraine had never been a real state, but had been “artificially” created in the 20th century. It was a long address, dismissing Ukrainian nationhood, blaming NATO and promising to restore “historical justice” for Russia.

“Is he declaring war?” – asked some foreign journalists on Twitter after listening to his speech. The answer was soon clear.

On 24 February the Russian invasion started with the shelling of military facilities in many parts of Ukraine, Russian troops crossing borders from the north and east of Ukraine, and from the south through occupied Crimea. Russian ships blocked the Black Sea.

In the last month Russian troops have, and continue to, repeatedly violate International Humanitarian Law (the ‘laws of war’), systematically launching indiscriminate attacks killing and injuring civilians and destroying homes, hospitals, schools and other civilian infrastructure.

The scale and impact of this war in Europe is unprecedented since the Second World War. Hundreds, an in all likelihood thousands, of civilians have been killed or injured in attacks by Russian forces. More than 10 million people have been displaced, with over 3 million having fled Ukraine to other countries.

The scale and impact of this war in Europe is unprecedented since the Second World War. Hundreds, an in all likelihood thousands, of civilians have been killed or injured in attacks by Russian forces

Although Putin claimed in the beginning that the Russian military targets only military infrastructure, this never appeared to be true.

Within hours of the invasion, Amnesty International verified reports and video footage that showed indiscriminate attacks across the country. Numerous strikes on hospitals and schools were documented. Russian troops were using inaccurate explosive weapons such as ballistic missiles and banned weapons such as cluster bombs. Russian forces carried out attacks that struck and destroyed residential houses, schools, kindergartens, medical facilities, and food stores.

More reports are emerging that point to further war crimes committed by Russian troops.

If you’ve seen the news you know big cities such as Kharkiv, Kyiv and Mariupol, as well as dozens of small towns and villages in Ukraine, are under relentless attack. Their desperate inhabitants are caught in the crossfire or under siege by attacking Russian forces.

Kharkiv, the second largest city in Ukraine, located about 30 km from the border with Russia is under constant bombardment with dozens killed and injured, civilian infrastructure widely damaged or destroyed and people struggling for their lives in unbearable conditions.

Several towns near Kyiv, like Irpin and Bucha, used to be picturesque and quiet neighbourhoods to which young families would move. But now they are largely destroyed, on the verge of being wiped out, leaving hundreds dead and thousands displaced. Those peaceful suburbs are now a humanitarian catastrophe.

In the east of Ukraine, the city Izyum, was a town of over 40,000 inhabitants. It has now been widely damaged and largely devastated.

According to testimonies collected by Amnesty International people in Izyum don’t have access to electricity, gas, or heating. Any form of communication has been cut off, and they are also suffering from the lack of sanitation and clean water.

People who have managed to flee the town are sharing their stories.

Tetyana, who took cover in a shelter in the town with her five-month-old baby, said: “When we were leaving [evacuating], there were three five-litre containers [of water] left for 55 people. I don’t know how they are going to survive.”

Natalia, a resident of a private house, said: “We spent six days in a cellar. It’s very small, you have to stand in it, it’s impossible to lie down. As soon as there was a pause [in attacks], we would quickly run out, and get some eggs from the hens… Our child was hungry, since we hardly ate. All we had was leftover dry bread, apples from the cellar, canned pickles, and jam… We couldn’t get any other food anywhere; we couldn’t leave our house. Everything was under fire.”

The Russian war against Ukraine has brought the destruction of lives, cities, families, and the hopes and dreams of many people.

However, the destruction ordered by Putin is not only the destruction of Ukraine and Ukrainians. It is also the destruction of the hopes and aspirations of many Russians.

However, the destruction ordered by Putin is not only the destruction of Ukraine and Ukrainians. It is also the destruction of the hopes and aspirations of many Russians

This war is also causing the destruction of the lives of people far beyond these two countries, as the food crisis escalates and the environment is damaged. With ever more people being forced to leave their homes to seek a safer life.

However, as it was during the Maidan revolution, Ukrainian society shows an incredible resilience and ability to unite in the darkest hours and spread hope.

Civil society organizations, that have been the backbone of Ukrainian society for years, are now focused on helping civilians – they organize evacuations, the delivery of humanitarian aid from other countries and try and distribute it to affected areas, doing it under constant shelling, at risk to their lives.

The director of one of the grass roots NGOs that operates in the east of Ukraine, is now together with her colleagues evacuating civilians from the most affected regions. Every day she writes a post on Facebook saying “We are alive. Working”.

Although the many lives lost in this war will remain a wound for Ukrainians and others for decades to come, as long as activists, volunteers and civil society organizations are alive and working, the restoration of Ukraine, peace and human rights is possible.

I still harbour hopes to come back home and see that cup of cold tea on the table.

Russia signaled a possible recalibration of its war aims in Ukraine on Friday as the Kremlin faced spreading global ostracism for the brutal invasion, hardened Western economic punishments and a determined Ukrainian resistance that appeared to be making some gains on the ground.

A statement by Russia’s Defense Ministry said the goals of the “first stage of the operation” had been “mainly accomplished,” with Ukraine’s combat capabilities “significantly reduced,” and that it would now focus on securing Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, where Russia-backed separatists have been fighting for eight years.

The Defense Ministry statement was ambiguous about further possible Russian territorial ambitions in Ukraine, where its ground forces have been mostly stymied by the unexpectedly strong Ukrainian military response.

But on a day when President Biden was visiting U.S. soldiers in Poland near the Ukrainian border, the statement suggested the possibility that the Russians were looking for a way to salvage some kind of achievement before the costs of the war they launched a month ago became impossibly onerous.

While Russia “does not exclude” that its forces will storm major Ukrainian cities such as Chernihiv, Mykolaiv and the capital, Kyiv, the Defense Ministry statement said that taking them over was not the primary objective.

“As individual units carry out their tasks — and they are being solved successfully — our forces and means will be concentrated on the main thing: the complete liberation of the Donbas,” Col. Gen. Sergei Rudskoi, a senior Russian military commander, said in the statement, his first since Russia’s invasion on Feb. 24.

Whether General Rudskoi’s statement was sincere or simply strategic misdirection was difficult to assess. But the statement amounted to the most direct acknowledgment yet that Russia may be unable to take full control of Ukraine and would instead target the Donbas region, where Russia has recognized the independence of two Kremlin-backed separatist areas that it calls the “Donetsk People’s Republic” and the “Luhansk People’s Republic.”

Russia has also insisted that Ukraine recognize its control of Crimea, which President Vladimir V. Putin’s forces seized from Ukraine in 2014.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has ruled out ceding those regions to stop the war.

Pavel Luzin, a Russian military analyst, cautioned that the public pronouncements of Russian military commanders should be regarded skeptically. While Russia could indeed be narrowing its war aims, he said, General Rudskoi’s statement could also be a feint as Russia regroups for a new offensive.

“We could say that this is a signal that we’re no longer insisting on dismantling Ukrainian statehood,” Mr. Luzin said. “But I would rather see it as a distracting maneuver.”

General Rudskoi’s statement came as Ukraine acknowledged that Russian forces had been “partially successful” in achieving one of their key objectives — securing a land corridor from Russia to the Crimean Peninsula.

While Russia already controlled much of the area, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said the route allowed Russian troops and supplies to flow between Crimea and Russia.

But some Ukrainian officials said the significance of such a route might be overstated. Oleksandr Danylyuk, a former secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine under Mr. Zelensky, described the land bridge as a minor Russian victory and said the Kremlin was moving to secure Donetsk and Luhansk to “sell to the Russian public as a potential victory.”

In Moscow, Mr. Putin, who has made any criticism of the war a potential crime, used a televised videoconference with the winners of a presidential arts prize on Friday to deliver a diatribe about “cancel culture” that made no mention of the war in Ukraine.

In embracing a term that has become a favorite of the American political right to reprise his contention that the West is trying to erase Russian culture and history, Mr. Putin cited J.K. Rowling, author of the “Harry Potter” books, whose comments about transgender women have been criticized as transphobic.

“Not so long ago, the children’s writer J.K. Rowling was also ‘canceled’ for the fact that she — the author of books that have sold hundreds of millions of copies around the world — did not please fans of so-called gender freedoms,” Mr. Putin said.

Ms. Rowling responded on Twitter that, “Critiques of Western cancel culture are possibly not best made by those currently slaughtering civilians for the crime of resistance, or who jail and poison their critics.” She added the hashtag #IStandWithUkraine.

As Mr. Putin spoke, there were indications that Ukrainian forces were making some progress in the second week of their counteroffensive. A senior Pentagon official said that Russian forces no longer had full control of the southern port of Kherson and that the city, the first major urban center to be captured in the Russian invasion, was now “contested territory.”

The Pentagon assessment contradicted General Rudskoi’s claim on Friday that the Kherson region was “under full control.”

In another sign of the bloody stalemate in Ukraine, Russian soldiers have adopted “defensive positions” near Kyiv, the Pentagon official said, adding that Russia appeared to be “prioritizing” the fight in eastern Ukraine, as General Rudskoi had indicated.

“Clearly, they overestimated their ability to take Kyiv and overestimated their ability to take any population center,” the Pentagon official said.

Mr. Biden, on the second day of his three-day visit to Europe because of the Ukraine crisis, traveled to Rzeszow, Poland, about 50 miles from the Ukrainian border, where he met with members of the 82nd Airborne Division who are serving as part of NATO’s efforts to protect Poland and other member states from Russian aggression.

Greeting American service members who were eating pizza in a cafeteria, Mr. Biden called them “the finest fighting force in the history of the world,” and added, “I personally thank you for what you do.”

Later, Mr. Biden met with President Andrzej Duda of Poland and officials managing the humanitarian response to the more than two million Ukrainian refugees who have fled to Poland to escape the shelling and deprivation.

Mr. Biden also announced a deal to increase U.S. shipments of natural gas to help wean Europe off Russian energy. But it remained unclear exactly how the administration would achieve its goals.

The deal calls for the United States to send an additional 15 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas — roughly 10 to 12 percent of current annual U.S. exports to all countries. But it does not address the lack of port capacity to ship and receive more gas on both sides of the Atlantic.

Still, American gas executives welcomed a renewed emphasis on exports as a sign that the Biden administration was now seeking to promote the U.S. oil and gas industry rather than punish it for contributions to climate change.

“I have no idea how they are going to do this, but I don’t want to criticize them because for the first time they are trying to do the right thing,” said Charif Souki, executive chairman of Tellurian, a U.S. gas producer that is planning to build an export terminal in Louisiana.

Robert Habeck, the vice chancellor and economic minister of Germany, said his country expected to halve imports of Russian oil by midsummer and nearly end them by year’s end — sooner than many thought possible. He estimated that Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, could be free of Russian gas by mid-2024.

Images and videos from Ukraine that emerged on Friday underscored the escalating death toll and destruction.

Newly surfaced security camera footage, verified by The New York Times, showed an attack on people in line for emergency aid outside a post office and shopping center in the battered northeastern city of Kharkiv on Thursday. Oleg Sinegubov, the head of the regional government there, said that at least six civilians had been killed and 15 wounded.

Photographs out of Kharkiv on Friday also showed a large fireball and nearby cars and buildings on fire, as residents fled on foot and bicycle, carrying whatever belongings they could grab in the aftermath of the attack.

In the central city of Dnipro, Russian missile strikes on a military facility destroyed buildings late Thursday night, according to Ukrainian officials, who said that casualties were still being assessed.

And in Mariupol, the southern port savaged by Russian attacks, Ukrainian officials said that an estimated 300 people had been killed in a March 16 strike on a theater used as a bomb shelter.

It was unclear how officials had arrived at that estimate. Ukrainian officials have said that about 130 people were rescued from the theater, which was attacked even though “children” had been written in giant letters on the pavement on both sides of the building.

The United Nations said on Friday that more than 1,000 civilians have been killed, including 93 children, since Russia’s invasion began, many in what appeared to have been indiscriminate bombardments that could constitute war crimes.

The United Nations cautioned that it had not been able to verify the death toll in areas of intense conflict, including Mariupol, and said the actual number of injured and dead was likely to be considerably higher.

In a sign that diplomatic efforts were struggling, Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, rejected comments by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, who had suggested that Ukraine was open to concessions in four key areas.

In an interview released Friday, Mr. Erdogan, who is hosting talks between Ukrainian and Russian delegations, said that Ukraine was willing to drop its bid for NATO membership, accept Russian as an official language, make “certain concessions” about disarmament and agree to “collective security.”

But Mr. Kuleba said the negotiations had proved “very difficult” and that Ukraine had “taken a strong position and does not relinquish its demands.”

“We insist, first of all, on a cease-fire, security guarantees and territorial integrity of Ukraine,” he said, adding that there was “no consensus with Russia on the four points mentioned by the president of Turkey.”

“In particular,” he said, “the Ukrainian language is and will be the only one state language in Ukraine.”
