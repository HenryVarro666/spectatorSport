An Australian photojournalist has captured the moment a missile flew over his head in Kramatorsk, Ukraine during a livestream.

""Oh f**k that's a missile, that's a f**king missile,"" photojournalist and documentary maker Bryce Wilson says in the video, panning to the object flying through the sky.

""Holy s**t. We better get inside"".

Mr Wilson, from Melbourne, had been livestreaming to Instagram in the moments after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

""There's [cruise] missiles flying above the f**king city right now,"" he said while running. ""There's been an impact in the distance.""

""Holy f**king s**t,"" he says again, as faint explosions can be heard in the background saying he can see fighter jets and smoke. ""The Russian military is bombing Kramatorsk.""

He also showed a mushroom cloud that had developed after the explosion in the direction the missile had been travelling.

'Hypersonic missiles are being used to attack Kramatorsk': Bryce Wilson

The journalist filmed himself talking as he walked along the street with a colleague, occasionally panning to show his surroundings showing a largely bare street and occasionally exchanging passing pleasantries with Ukrainian people.

""Kramatorsk is being attacked,"" he tweeted.

In a follow-up livestream on Instagram, Mr Wilson filmed himself wearing armour and walking through Kramatorsk in eastern Ukraine heading towards a bomb shelter with some fellow journalists.

Mr Wilson says he is in Ukraine voluntarily and has been working in and out of the country for several years.

""I can't believe this is happening,"" he said in disbelief.

Mr Wilson said in the livestream he would try and make it back to Kyiv.

""People legitimately don't think this is happening,"" he said, panning across the eerily quiet street. ""This country is being attacked"".

Putin orders Russia to attack

The UK and Western allies have condemned Putin after the Russian President ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine and called on it to ""lay down"" its arms.

Boris Johnson – whose initial package of sanctions was criticised by senior Tories and opposition figures – has promised to respond “decisively” to the Russian onslaught.

“I am appalled by the horrific events in Ukraine and I have spoken to President Zelensky to discuss next steps,” he said. “President Putin has chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction by launching this unprovoked attack on Ukraine.

“The UK and our allies will respond decisively.""

Putin announced the action during a televised address early on Thursday morning, saying the move was a response to threats from Ukraine.

He said Russia does not have a goal to occupy Ukraine, but the responsibility for bloodshed lies with the Ukrainian “regime”.

Russia’s military said it has targeted Ukrainian air bases and other military assets and has not targeted populated areas.",https://news.yahoo.com/aussie-livestreams-moment-missile-flies-over-his-head-in-ukraine-083426735-100245049.html

“The enemy suffers losses. Currently, six Russian air force planes and two helicopters have been shot down,” the defence ministry claimed, just hours after Moscow had launched strikes against Ukrainian military facilities in the early hours of 24 February.

This action saw Russian forces “launch rocket and bomb attacks on airfields in Boryspil, Ozernoye, Kulbakin, Chuguev, Kramatorsk, Chornobayevka”, Kiev says.

Condemning Moscow’s “unjustified, false and cynical invasion”, the defence ministry adds: “The Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is repelling an air attack by the invader”.

Ukraine’s defence inventory is dwarfed by that of Russia. Cirium fleets data cited in FlightGlobal’s latest World Air Forces directory shows that Kiev has 318 military aircraft in use, including 98 combat aircraft and 112 combat helicopters. Its fixed-wing combat assets include Soviet-era RAC MiG-29s and Sukhoi Su-24, Su-25 and Su-27 jets.

(Russia 24)

Before the crack of dawn, just before explosions began in cities across Ukraine, Russian state television unexpectedly broadcast an address by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The two self-proclaimed ""people's republics"" of Donetsk and Luhansk, in the breakaway Ukrainian region of Donbas, which he had officially recognized as independent less than two days before, had ""turned to Russia with a request for help,"" he said. To answer that call he was launching a ""special military operation."" Its purpose: to ""demilitarize"" and ""denazifiy"" Ukraine.

Within minutes, Russian missiles began hitting targets in Ukraine. ""Our actions are self-defense against threats,"" he told his fellow Russians, claiming Moscow had no plans to occupy Ukraine. ""We do not plan to impose ourselves on anyone,"" he insisted.

Putin described the ""special military operation"" in limited terms, to protect people living in Donbas who, he claimed, had been subjected to ""genocide,"" a charge that Ukraine has strenuously denied. But in the next breath, he lashed out more broadly: ""NATO supports Ukrainian neo-Nazis ... our actions are self-defense against threats.""

Then, in an extraordinary passage, he spoke directly to members of Ukraine's military, at that very moment in the crosshairs of the Russian military. Addressing them as ""dear comrades,"" he told them they had taken an ""oath of allegiance to the Ukrainian people, and not to the anti-people junta that is robbing Ukraine and abuses those same people.""

""Don't follow its criminal orders!"" he demanded. ""I urge you to lay down your weapons and go home.""

As he has done so many times before, Putin claimed Russia had no choice but to defend itself. With a hard-edged tone in his voice, he seemed to threaten the US, Europe and NATO which, in just a few minutes, would witness his armed forces opening fire on Ukraine, something the Kremlin had consistently dismissed as western ""hysterics.""

""Whoever tries to interfere with us, and even more so, to create threats for our country, for our people, should know that Russia's response will be immediate and will lead you to such consequences that you have never experienced in your history.

""We are ready for any development of events. All necessary decisions in this regard have been made.""

Putin, who for years had criticized the West for ignoring his complaints about NATO's expansion toward Russia's borders, was finally striking back with fury. ""I hope,"" he concluded his short address, ""that I have been heard.""

Putin announced a 'special military operation' in the east of Ukraine in a televised address after which explosions were reported in the outskirts of a number of cities, including Kharkiv, Kramatorsk, Mariupol, as well as the capital Kyiv.

Airports in the country have temporarily shut down in a bid to prevent potential Russian aircraft landings, while Russia has also closed its own airspace around the border from civilian access for the next four months.

Following Putin's announcement, Ukraine’s military said its air defence shot down a Russian plane in eastern Ukraine, and separately downed five Russian planes and one helicopter in the eastern Luhansk region.

Russia's defence ministry, however, has denied reports that one of its aircraft has been shot down.

According to reports by Russian news agencies, per LBC, it claimed to have attacked military infrastructure at Ukrainian air bases and degraded Ukraine’s air defences.

Sky News correspondent Stuart Ramsay said it is 'possible but unlikely' that Russian planes have been shot down.

Luhansk, where Ukraine claimed to have taken out six aircraft, is partially held by Russian-backed separatists and was recognised as independent by Putin earlier this week.

Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser for the Interior Minister of Ukraine, confirmed Russia's 'invasion [had] begun' with 'missile strikes on Kyiv' in the early hours of Thursday, February 24.

Putin has just launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Peaceful Ukrainian cities are under strikes. This is a war of aggression. Ukraine will defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now. — Dmytro Kuleba (@DmytroKuleba) February 24, 2022

In a post on his Facebook page, Gerashchenko added that control centres such as airfields and military headquarters had been struck by the shelling in Kyiv and Kharkiv, and that artillery fire has been taking place along the border.

Hundreds of Ukrainian civilians have been reported dead in the hours since Russian and Belarusian tanks crossed the border into the country, according to a CNN contact at the interior ministry.

Citing the official, CNN reported, 'Across the country, as a result of these attacks, there are hundreds of casualties.'

Leaders and officials in the West have condemned Putin's decision to launch in invasion, with a statement from the Ukrainian foreign ministry saying, 'This is an act of war, an attack on sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, a gross violation of the UN Statute and the fundamental norms and principles of international law.'

Russia's President Vladimir Putin took to the airwaves at 3am UK time to announce he had ordered the start of a ""special operation"" into Ukraine on Thursday. Explosions could be heard within minutes of the announcements, and over a dozen people have been reported dead in shelling and missile attacks. Footage has now emerged appearing to show two planes engaging in a chase over the skies of Ukraine's capital, Kiev.

According to eyewitnesses near Kiev, a Ukrainian MiG-29 was spotted taking on a Russian Su-35 in the area around the capital. Defense analyst Guy Plipsky said on Twitter: ""Video showing what appears to be a pair of UAF MiG-29s, one of which zooms past the camera at tree-top level, reportedly in the Kyiv area. ""Note the dark smoke trial - it is not due to damage; the #MiG29's RD-33 turbofans are notorious for being smokey."" Military historian Cedric Mas said: ""Ukraine - impressive and rare images of a fight at low altitude between a Ukrainian MiG-29 and a Russian Su-35. It's Kiev.""

Ukrainian troops fought Russian forces along practically the entire border, and fierce fighting was taking place in the regions of Sumy, Kharkiv, Kherson, Odessa and at a military airport near Kyiv, an adviser to the presidential office said. Explosions were heard before dawn and throughout the morning in the capital Kyiv, a city of 3 million people. Gunfire rattled, sirens blared, and the highway out of the city choked with traffic as residents fled. The assault brought a calamitous end to weeks of fruitless diplomatic efforts by Western leaders to avert war, their worst fears about Russian President Vladimir Putin's ambitions realised.
