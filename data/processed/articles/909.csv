British foreign secretary to visit Poland, call for tougher sanctions on Russia British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss will visit Poland on Monday to call for tougher sanctions on Russia, her office said, as major western countries work together to ramp up the pressure on President Vladimir Putin and end the conflict in Ukraine. ""Putin is yet to show he is serious about diplomacy. A tough approach from the UK and our allies is vital to strengthen Ukraine's hand in negotiations,"" Truss said. ""Britain has helped lead the way with sanctions to cripple the Putin war machine. We will do more to ramp up the pressure on Russia and we will keep pushing others to do more."" Truss is due to meet Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba in Poland's capital Warsaw later today and her Polish counterpart Zbigniew Rau on Tuesday. Britain, a former European Union member, has coordinated with international allies to impose sanctions on key Russian industries and Moscow's wealthy elites with the aim of crippling its economy in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine prosecutor-general says 410 civilian bodies found near Kyiv KYIV, Ukraine —Ukraine’s prosecutor-general says the bodies of 410 civilians have been removed from Kyiv-area towns that were recently retaken from Russian forces. Iryna Venediktova, Ukraine’s prosecutor-general, says on Facebook that the bodies were removed on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. She says 140 of them have undergone examination by prosecutors and other specialists. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk says Sunday that the mayor of the village of Motyzhyn, in the Kyiv region, was murdered while being held by Russian forces. Vereshchuk added that there are 11 mayors and community heads in Russian captivity across Ukraine. In a video address on Sunday, Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denounced the allegedly targeted killings of civilians in towns the Russians occupied and called them “freaks who do not know how to do otherwise.” He warned that more atrocities may be revealed if Russian forces are driven out of other occupied areas. International leaders have condemned the reported attacks on the Kyiv-area towns after harrowing accounts from civilians and graphic images of bodies with hands tied behind their backs.

Zelenskyy decries war atrocities in new address, saying, 'Evil will be punished' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivered his harshest rebuke yet Sunday as Russian forces retreated from the war-torn city of Bucha, Ukraine, leaving in their wake a mass of what appeared to be civilian fatalities. ""Today this appeal will be without congratulations. I do not want any extra words. Presidents do not usually record appeals like this. But today I have to say just that. To say after what opened in Bucha and our other cities, from which the occupiers were chased out. Hundreds of people were killed. Tortured, shot — civilians. Bodies on the streets. Mined territory,"" Zelenskyy said. ""The bodies of the dead were mined."" Zelenskyy switched from speaking Ukrainian and made a direct appeal in Russian, saying: ""I want every mother of every Russian soldier to see the bodies of the killed people in Bucha, in Irpin, in Hostomel. What did they do? Why were they killed? What did the man who was riding his bicycle down the street do? Why were ordinary civilians tortured to death in an ordinary peaceful city? Why were women strangled after their earrings were torn out of their ears? How could women be raped and killed in front of children? Their bodies were mocked even after death. Why did they crush the bodies of people with tanks? What did the Ukrainian city of Bucha do to your Russia? How did all this become possible?"" He added: ""Russian mothers! Even if you raised marauders, how did they also become executioners? You couldn't help but know what's inside your children. You could not help but notice that they are deprived of everything human. No soul. No heart. They killed deliberately and with pleasure."" Speaking again in Ukrainian, Zelenskyy said that ""evil will be punished"" and that he had created a ""special mechanism of justice"" in Ukraine to investigate and prosecute every crime of Russian occupiers in the country. ""The essence of this mechanism is the joint work of national and international experts: investigators, prosecutors and judges. This mechanism will help Ukraine and the world to bring to justice those who unleashed or in any way participated in this terrible war against the Ukrainian people and in crimes against our people,"" he said.

NATO chief: This is 'not a real withdrawal' NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Sunday said Russia is shifting its strategy in Ukraine, explaining that Putin's retreat from Kyiv is not a sign that he is withdrawing from the country. “What we see is not a real withdrawal,"" Stoltenberg said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. ""What we see is that Russia is repositioning its troops, and they are taking some of them back to rearm them, to reinforce them, to resupply them. But we should not in a way be too optimistic because the attacks will continue."" His remarks came after Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned of a Russian buildup of forces in the east of his war-torn country, in a video posted to Telegram on Saturday. In an intelligence briefing, British defense officials said Moscow's naval forces have continued to blockade areas on Ukraine's southern coast, preventing resupply by sea. There is concern about ""potential increased attacks, especially in the south and in the east. So this is not a real withdrawal but more a shift in the strategy, focusing more on the south and the east,"" Stoltenberg added. Share this -

""And at the same time, they may be regrouping. They may be recalibrating."" In a video posted to Telegram on Saturday night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia was building up forces in the east of the country and called on Western countries to provide more anti-missile systems. Russia wants to ""capture both the Donbas and the south of Ukraine,"" he said.

Russian naval forces block Ukraine's resupply by Black Sea, U.K. military intelligence says Russian naval forces continue to blockade the Ukrainian coast on the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, preventing resupply by sea, British military intelligence said Sunday. In its latest assessment of the situation, the U.K.'s defense ministry tweeted that Russia still retains the capability to attempt an amphibious landing, but such an operation is likely to be increasingly high risk given the time Ukrainian forces have had to prepare. ""Reported mines within the Black Sea pose a serious risk to maritime activity,"" it added. The report said the origin of the mines was unclear and disputed, but their presence was almost certainly the result of Russian naval activity in the area, demonstrating how its invasion of Ukraine is affecting neutral and civilian interests.

""Indeed, this is genocide. The elimination of the whole nation and the people.""

That's what Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview last night.

Genocide is defined as a mass extermination of a particular group of people - typified by the efforts of the Nazis to eradicate Jews in the 1940s.

But behind that simple definition is a complicated tangle of legal concepts concerning what constitutes genocide.

The United Nations Genocide Convention came into effect in 1951 and defines genocide as committing any of the following acts with ""the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group"":

Killing members of the group

Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members

Deliberately inflicting conditions calculated to bring about the group's physical destruction, in whole or in part

Putting measures in place to prevent births within the group

Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group

The convention imposes a duty on those who have signed up to it to prevent and punish genocide.

However, since its adoption it's come under criticism from different sides - mostly by people frustrated with the difficulty of applying it to specific cases. Some have argued that the definition is too narrow; others that it is devalued by overuse.

A 12-year-old boy who carved a wooden bowl to raffle for Ukrainians affected by the war has raised more than £200,000 for Save the Children's Ukraine appeal.

Gabriel Clark, from Cumbria, went viral last month after his father Richard issued a plea on social media for people to follow his son's woodwork Instagram account.

Within days, Gabriel's Instagram account, which shared picture's of the schoolboy's handcrafted creations, went from having six followers to 225,000.

The young boy soon decided to create one special bowl for Ukraine in an effort to raise funds for those affected by the ongoing war.

The Bowl For Ukraine appeal has now raised £215,822 and will end today when one winner will be chosen at random to win Gabriel's wooden bowl.

In a message on social media, Gabriel's father Richard wrote: ""How it ends is up to you. It's your story. Certainly we could all pat ourselves on the back for a job well done.

""Save the Children are already enormously grateful for the very real difference this money will make. But what if there was another ending?

""What if we threw caution to the wind and let go of our cynicism and really went for it?

""What if we blew this silly tale of a small boy and his bowl out of the water with a last swing shot around the moon?""",https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-live-news-russia-faces-new-sanctions-war-crimes-bucha-nato-12541713?postid=3677653
