The United States has sought to speed weapons deliveries to Ukraine. But the prospect of flying combat aircraft from NATO territory into the war zone ""raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,"" the Pentagon said.

NATO has said it does not want direct conflict with Russia, a fellow nuclear-armed power, and President Joe Biden has ruled out sending U.S. troops into Ukraine to fight, something the Pentagon has said would apply to troops on the ground or in the air, flying missions.

""It is simply not clear to us that there is a substantive rationale for it,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said of Poland's proposal.

""We will continue to consult with Poland and our other NATO allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland’s proposal is a tenable one.""

Poland's foreign ministry announced on Tuesday that it was ready to deploy its MiG-29 jets to Ramstein Air Base in Germany and put them at the disposal of the United States. It urged other members of the alliance that had other such aircraft to do the same.

The U.S. State Department's No. 3 diplomat said the Polish proposal caught the United States by surprise.

""To my knowledge, it wasn't pre-consulted with us that they planned to give these planes to us,"" State Department Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland told a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing.

""So I think that actually was a surprise move by the Poles,"" she said.

The impasse raises questions about the viability of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy plea for European countries to provide Russian-made planes, an issue he underscored during a video call Saturday with U.S. lawmakers.

U.S. lawmakers are eager to speed military aid to Ukraine and are pushing the Biden administration to facilitate the aircraft transfer.

But Poland's announcement could also reflect its own sensitivities.

Poland is supporting Ukraine with defensive weapons, but has said it would not send jets as it is not a direct party to the conflict between Ukraine - which is not a NATO ally - and Russia.

Russia's defense ministry warned this week that countries offering air fields to Ukraine for attacks on Russia may be considered as having entered the conflict.

Nuland said the main issue was to assess what Poland's immediate needs would be given it is adjacent to the conflict.

""Poland - they benefit from full air security from the NATO alliance. ... The main issue is to evaluate what Poland's immediate needs are in the context of being a neighbor of this conflict,"" she said.

Separately, the U.S. military announced it would reposition two Patriot missile batteries to Poland to proactively ""counter any potential threat to U.S. and Allied forces and NATO territory.""

The latest: Pentagon press secretary John Kirby issued a statement Tuesday evening indicating that the Polish government had not consulted with the U.S. prior to its announcement.

What they're saying: ""The prospect of fighter jets 'at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America' departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,"" Kirby said.

""It is simply not clear to us that there is a substantive rationale for it,"" he added, stressing that the proposal ""shows just some of the complexities this issue presents.""

""We will continue to consult with Poland and our other NATO allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland's proposal is a tenable one.""

Why it matters: Ukraine has pleaded with the Western allies to either impose a ""no-fly"" zone or hand over warplanes that Ukrainian pilots could use to counter Russia's aerial assault.

Zoom in: Under one option being considered by the Biden administration, the U.S. would backfill Poland's MiG-29 fleet with American-made F-16 fighter jets.

The U.S. and Poland had downplayed the chances of such a deal as recently as Monday, warning of major logistics issues and the risk of provoking Russia.

That suddenly appeared to change on Tuesday, when Poland said it would send the MiGs to the U.S. in exchange for ""used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities.""

Poland also called on other eastern-flank NATO allies in possession of MiGs — Bulgaria and Slovakia — to take similar steps.

Between the lines: After Poland's announcement, which appeared to shift responsibility for making the deal happen to the U.S., a top State Department official said the Biden administration was not consulted.

""To my knowledge, it wasn't pre-consulted with us that they planned to give these planes to us,"" Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland testified to the Senate.

Russia's Defense Ministry had warned on Sunday that any country that allows Ukrainian-operated airplanes to use their soil to attack the Russian military could be considered a participant in the conflict.

What to watch: The Biden administration is still facing bipartisan pressure from Congress to somehow facilitate the transfer of the jets to Ukraine.

In principle, the U.S. has said Poland has a ""green light"" to send the jets to Ukraine — but the logistical and political hurdles may be prove too difficult to surmount.

4,e5f975c1-8aaf-46b9-a71f-9576883e2ab0,"['Aaron Mehta', 'Breaking Defense', 'Valerie Insinna', 'Collins Aerospace', 'Raytheon Intelligence']",2022-03-08 22:41:40+00:00,"WASHINGTON: After several days of discussions around a fighter jet swap that would see Poland give its MiG-29 fleet to Ukraine in exchange for American F-16s, Poland today announced that it is ready to give America the jets and let Washington then transfer them to Kyiv.

The problem: it seems no one told the US, and after hours of confusion, a Pentagon statement effectively shut the door on the plan.

The Polish announcement, published in English on a government website Tuesday afternoon, stated that the “authorities of the Republic of Poland, after consultations between the President and the Government, are ready to deploy — immediately and free of charge — all their MIG-29 jets to the Ramstein Air Base and place them at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America.

“At the same time, Poland requests the United States to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities. Poland is ready to immediately establish the conditions of purchase of the planes. The Polish Government also requests other NATO Allies — owners of MIG-29 jets — to act in the same vein.”

The announcement was followed by a rush of excitement online that a deal had been reached to get Ukraine much-needed aviation assets, a cause that had been picked up by Ukrainian supporters around the world and inside the US Congress. But the fact the statement said Poland is “ready to deploy” the planes, and that no US government announcement immediately came with it, raised red flags.

The first official response was from a senior defense official who said only “We’ve seen the Polish government’s announcement. We have nothing to offer at this time.” A more definitive take came from Victoria Nuland, undersecretary of state for political affairs, who happened to be testifying in front of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee shortly after the announcement came out.

In response to a question about Poland’s statement, Nuland said, “I saw that announcement by the government of Poland as I was literally driving here today. To my knowledge, it wasn’t pre-consulted with us that they planned to give the planes to us … I look forward to getting back to my desk and seeing how we will respond to this proposal of theirs, to give their planes to us.”

Asked later in the hearing to clarify that the Polish offer was not coordinated, Nuland said, “Not to my knowledge. I was in a meeting where I ought to have heard about that just before I came. So I think that actually was a surprise move by the Poles.”

The confusion continued later in the day, after Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said any decisions about delivering offensive weapons to Ukraine must be made by NATO members unanimously. And hours after the announcement was made, the Pentagon released a statement calling the complex deal described by Poland not “tenable.”

“The prospect of fighter jets ‘at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America’ departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance. It is simply not clear to us that there is a substantive rationale for it,” the statement said, noting that the proposal “shows just some of the complexities this issue presents.”

At least one key NATO ally may prefer that the potential fighter swap have been kept under better wraps.

Speaking at a Center for a New American Security event today, French Chief of Defence Gen. Thierry Burkhard said that “we have to” provide weapons to Ukraine. But, he said, it must be done in a “reasonable way” — one that is less public.

“The support that is brought by European countries and NATO, it’s something that needs to be done, but not necessarily communicated upon,” Burkhard said through a translator. “So we shouldn’t communicate too much about this.

“The Russians can accept a certain number of things, but they cannot accept that we overplayed our support for Ukraine,” he said later in the event. “The less we can say, the more we can do.”

How Would The Fighter Deal Work?

Even before the Pentagon all but killed Poland’s proposal, there were legal questions about how the US could accept a gift of almost 30 Russian-made fighters from Poland. A precedent for such a deal, where the US accepts a gift of weapons from another country was not immediately apparent, nor is it clear what legal method the US would use to transfer those weapons back to Ukraine.

“This does create a little bit of, like, bureaucratic ‘can we even do this sort of situation,’” Max Bergmann, who served at the State Department from 2011 to 2017, including as senior adviser to the assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs, said before the Pentagon’s statement was released. While noting that he could not think of anything comparable in the past, Bergmann did say that if the US was interested in pursuing the plan, “My guess is we can probably find a way.”

Bergmann, now with the Center for American Progress, said he thinks the confusion about today’s actions come from Polish leaders having created a “political problem for themselves” when early discussions about a jet swap became public.

Likely, Warsaw “looked at the potential escalatory impacts of transferring these planes from Polish airfields adjacent to Ukraine, and thought, ‘Yeah, that’s putting a target on us, and that is escalatory.’ And they don’t know how to back down, how to sort of get out of this,” Bergmann said. “They don’t want to look soft vis-a-vis Russia and to their public, and so they just tried to kick this problem to the United States.”

Then there are questions about logistics — how the jets would get to Ukraine without being shot down by Russian air assets, where they would be based, who would fly and maintain them, how the Ukrainian pilots would get to Germany to take control of the planes and, not to mention, how quickly the US could backfill planes to Poland.

Nuland noted that a key part in any deal where Poland gives up air assets would be making sure they still “benefit from full air security from the NATO alliance,” which is where the backfill of jets by the US would come in.

Based on the statement from Warsaw, Poland is willing to accept older F-16 models, as opposed to new planes. That opens up the next question of what exactly “corresponding operational capabilities” means. Based on the upgrades Poland did in the mid-2010s, that comparable capability would seem to be somewhere between a Block 30 and a Block 40/42 jet — capabilities most readily available in the Air National Guard — with European compatible navigation systems installed.

But considering the surprise from the US side and the Pentagon’s blunt assessment, it’s an open question how or if a fighter swap plan proceeds at all.

“Sometimes you throw ideas out there, they get pursued, they get reported, people get excited and then at the end of the day you say, ‘That’s not gonna make any sense,’” Bergmann said. “I feel like that’s where we’re headed. Everyone got excited. Everyone got a little over their skis. Ultimately, the important thing is to make the right decision about what to do.”",https://breakingdefense.com/2022/03/polands-surprise-mig-29-offer-for-ukraine-met-with-confusion-in-us/

The United States all but declined an offer from Poland on Tuesday to deliver an unspecified number of MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine so that the warplanes could be used against invading Russian forces. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight “We do not believe Poland’s proposal is a tenable one,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said in a statement.

The unusual public offer, posted on the website of the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, blindsided U.S. officials who said they were not consulted by the Polish government ahead of the proposal.

Poland has sought to equip Ukraine with aircraft to fight Russia even as Moscow has warned that any country hosting Ukraine’s military aircraft would be considered a party to the ongoing armed conflict there.

In its statement, Poland said it is “ready to deploy — immediately and free of charge — all their MiG-29 jets to the Ramstein Air Base and place them at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America.” Ramstein is an American military facility located in Germany.

Kirby raised the prospect that Poland’s proposal could inflame tensions with Russia, which has depicted the conflict in Ukraine as one against Western aggression. Fighter jets “departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,” he said, adding, “It is simply not clear to us that there is a substantive rationale for it.”

The move by Poland appeared intended to shift the responsibility for delivering the aircraft — and risking a potential Russian military retaliation — to the United States. It occurred as the No. 3 official at the State Department, Victoria Nuland, testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

“To my knowledge, it wasn’t pre-consulted with us that they plan to give these planes to us,” Nuland, the under secretary of state for political affairs, told lawmakers. She characterized it as a “surprise move by the Poles.”

“I look forward when this hearing is over to getting back to my desk and seeing how we will respond to this proposal of theirs,” she said.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said that while all NATO countries have a “green light” to send fighter planes to Ukraine, the United States seeks to avoid directly confronting Russia. Washington has sent billions of dollars in military equipment to Ukraine in recent years.

A senior European official said Western officials were completely taken aback by Poland’s announcement. Another European official said he was “sideswiped.”

Poland’s announcement also requested that the United States “provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities” to offset the loss of planes it was offering Ukraine.

The offer would have served Poland by bolstering Ukraine’s resistance to Russia, a mutual geopolitical foe, and enhancing its own military. Poland, whose air force flies both the Russian-made MiG and the U.S.-manufactured F-16, in 2017 examined the possibility of replacing its MiGs with secondhand F-16s. At the time, they decided against doing so, considering such a deal cost-prohibitive.

Russia and Ukraine retain the bulk of their air forces, though aircraft have been lost on both sides, said a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Pentagon.

The airspace, this official said, remains “very contested,” with both side vying for control.

“Very little of the nation of Ukraine is not covered by some sort of Russian surface-to-air missile capability,” the defense official said.

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement that the Pentagon did not believe Poland's proposal was ""tenable,"" just hours after Polish officials released a statement saying the government was ready to deploy all of its MiG-29 fighter jets to US Air Force's Ramstein Air Base in Germany so they could then be provided to Ukraine in its fight against Russia.

Kirby said that the decision about transferring Polish-owned planes to Ukraine was ""ultimately one for the Polish government,"" adding that the proposal shows the complexities that the issue presents as Russia has made threatening statements over arms being provided to Ukrainians for use against Russian forces.

The idea as laid out by Poland was too risky, Kirby said, as the US and NATO seek to avoid an outright conflict between the alliance and Russia.

""The prospect of fighter jets 'at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America' departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,"" Kirby said.

Biden administration caught off guard

The Defense Department statement was released Tuesday evening after the Polish proposal caught the Biden administration completely off guard, multiple sources told CNN.

While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has pleaded for more aircraft amid the Russian invasion, the offer had not been discussed with the US before making it public and Polish officials did not bring it up with Secretary of State Antony Blinken when he was recently in Poland either.

US officials have privately weighed sending aircraft to Ukraine but have repeatedly noted the difficult logistical challenges of doing so.

Poland's surprise announcement complicates what had already been a high-stakes visit by Vice President Kamala Harris, who is due to land in Warsaw late Wednesday.

Harris had been expected to discuss the fighter jet issue while in Poland, according to officials. The White House had previously said it was in discussions with the Polish government about a plan for Poland to supply Ukraine with its Soviet-era fighter jets and the US to backfill the planes with F-16s.

Harris is still scheduled to depart Wednesday morning for Poland, but now there are intensive conversations within the administration about how to work with Poland to come to some sort of agreement that allows the jets to reach Ukraine.

A top State Department official said Tuesday that Poland did not consult with the United States prior to issuing its statement.

""I saw that announcement by the government of Poland as I was literally driving here today,"" Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland said during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing.

Nuland noted that the US and Poland have been in consultations for a couple of days on the possibility, but added she had come to the hearing directly from a meeting ""where (she) ought to have heard about.""

""So I think that actually was a surprise move by the Poles,"" Nuland told lawmakers.

'Ready to deploy'

The Polish government said in a statement Tuesday that it is ""ready to deploy -- immediately and free of charge -- all their MiG-29 jets to the Ramstein Air Base and place them at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America.""

""At the same time, Poland requests the United States to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities. Poland is ready to immediately establish the conditions of purchase of the planes,"" the statement said.

Speaking to US lawmakers virtually on Saturday, Zelensky asked for American support to facilitate the transfer of Soviet-era fighter jets from Eastern European nations to Ukraine, where pilots have been trained to fly them and could use them to attempt to control the skies as Russia conducts its war against the country.

By Saturday evening, US and Polish officials were in discussions about a potential agreement to supply the country with American F-16 fighter jets in exchange for Poland sending its Russian-made jets to Ukraine.

""We are working with Poland as we speak to see if we can backfill anything that they provide to the Ukrainians,"" Blinken said on CBS on Sunday. ""But we also want to see if we can be helpful in making sure that, whatever they provide to Ukrainians, something goes to them to make up for any gap in the security for Poland that might result.""

On Monday, a Pentagon spokesman said the Department of Defense was in ""interagency"" discussions to ""examine"" the possibility of the US sending fighter jets to other European countries if those countries choose to send fighter jets of their own to Ukraine.

Prior to the apparent dismissal of Warsaw's proposal by the Biden administration, members of Congress appeared supportive of the move. During Tuesday's Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin asked Nuland to ensure the Biden administration notifies Congress if there are going to be any delays getting F-16s to Poland.

Two European diplomats told CNN on Tuesday, prior to the Pentagon statement, that the complicated logistics behind the idea of Poland giving the jets to Ukraine had not yet been finalized.

The Polish announcement came after some Polish officials expressed frustration about how forward leaning the US was on this subject over the weekend, the sources said.

""In fact, we're talking with our Polish friends right now about what we might be able to do to backfill their needs if, in fact, they choose to provide these fighter jets to the Ukrainians. What can we do? How can we help to make sure that they get something to backfill the planes that they're handing over to the Ukrainians? We're in very active discussions with them about that,"" Blinken said Sunday.

A Polish official told CNN they believed Harris' trip would be a good time for the US to announce more details about aircraft transfers, but the Pentagon statement suggests such a possibility is unlikely.

Other countries that are in talks with the US about taking part in similar transfers are conducting the conversations quietly, without raising expectations, said a central European diplomat.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/08/politics/poland-jets-ukraine-russia/index.html

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Poland’s decision to put all its MiG-29 fighter jets at the disposal of the United States was “a surprise move” by Warsaw, the U.S. State Department’s No. 3 diplomat said on Tuesday, after Ukraine asked European countries to provide aircraft to help it fight Russia’s invasion.

“To my knowledge, it wasn’t pre-consulted with us that they planned to give these planes to us,” State Department Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland told a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. “So I think that actually was a surprise move by the Poles,” she said.

Poland is ready to deploy all its MiG-29 jets to Ramstein Air Base in Germany and put them at the disposal of the United States, and urges other NATO members that own planes of that type to do the same, the Polish Foreign Ministry said earlier.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy last week made a “desperate plea for European countries to provide Russian-made planes” for Ukraine’s fight against Russian invaders during a video call Saturday with U.S. lawmakers.

U.S. lawmakers have been pushing the Biden administration to facilitate the transfer of fighter aircraft to Ukraine from Poland and other NATO and Eastern European countries.

The administration has been discussing Ukraine’s request with Poland. U.S. administration officials said there were logistical challenges both in moving aircraft into Ukraine and providing replacement American planes.

The decision by Warsaw to offer its fleet of Soviet-era MIG-29 fighter jets to the United States set experts in the U.S. government scrambling for information on the legal constraints around the retransfer of the jets to Ukraine.

Nuland said the main issue was to assess what Poland’s immediate needs would be given it is adjacent to the conflict.

“Poland — they benefit from full air security from the NATO alliance. … The main issue is to evaluate what Poland’s immediate needs are in the context of being a neighbor of this conflict,” she said, adding that Washington was also looking at putting some Patriot missile batteries into Poland.

Poland is supporting Kyiv with defensive weapons, but has said it would not send jets to Ukraine, as it is not a direct party to the conflict between Ukraine – which is not a NATO ally – and Russia.

CUTTING THROUGH RED TAPE?

The U.S. Air Force and Department of Defense officials were still trying to understand the repercussions of the Polish MiG transfer but said the White House’s National Security Council was in the best position to understand whether the United States could even accept the jets as a donation.

If that donation were possible, it was unclear whether the U.S. could then transfer the jets to Ukraine, or whether the jets needed to be accepted, declared as excess, and then go through a process of transfer for excess defense articles.

Landing slots for the Polish jets at a U.S. air base in Germany and other practical concerns on how to physically get the jets into Ukraine were other unanswered legal questions, experts said.

The National Security Council did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The United States maintains a reserve of excess weapons, which can be transferred to other nations as long as certain statutory and regulatory hurdles are cleared.

If the MIGs are able to be classified as excess defense articles, the president is required to give Congress 30 days’ notice of a transfer, said Franklin Turner, a government contracts lawyer at McCarter & English.

He added that there was “a tremendous amount of red tape that clogs this process” and that Biden’s ability to cut through it was constrained by existing legal requirements.
