Since the beginning of the Russian invasion in Ukraine, 651 houses have been completely destroyed and about 3,780 houses have been partially damaged. According to Roman Primus, deputy head of the State Emergency Service, the scale of the destruction is much larger, as these figures take into account only those facilities where rescuers can assess the extent of the damage.

Humanitarian corridors

Today there will be three routes for evacuation of people from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia:

Berdiansk – Zaporizhzhia. Meeting place: sports complex on Melitopolske Shosse Street, 27.

Ukraine's talks with Russia

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is convinced that his meeting with Putin will reveal what Russia is ready for and whether the aggressor wants to end the war. Zelenskyy stated this in an interview with the Suspilne. ""Without this meeting in any format, you will not really understand to the end what they are ready to do to stop the war and what they are ready for if we are not ready for compromises.""

Atomic objects

Seven fires have already been registered in the Exclusion Zone. Rescuers cannot eliminate them due to the aggression of the occupiers. It is likely that the radiation background in Europe may increase slightly in the near future.

Who's coming to Ukraine?

About financial aid, weapons, and volunteer fighters

In the coming hours, Ukraine will receive more than two million doses of iodine. Also in the next few days, Ukrainian pharmacies will receive hormonal drugs.

The chief of regional military administration Serhii Haidai told about it in the morning on March 22. ""Yesterday during the day the fire in Rubizhne almost didn't stop. When the Russians didn't succeed in the blitzkrieg in Rubizhne, they began to do what they could, destroy the city: destroy houses, schools, hospitals.

Western Ukraine

Russia's special services are trying to destabilize the situation in Zakarpattia, said the head of the Zakarpattia Regional State Administration Viktor Mykyta. Thus, the occupiers send fake messages with threats to representatives of the Hungarian community on social media from unknown accounts. At this time, Russian websites are spreading misinformation about the ""desire of the Hungarian community in the region to secede from Ukraine."" ""We knew about such intentions long before this information attack began. We were ready, so we systematically and effectively counteract these incursions,"" Viktor Mykyta said.

A group of saboteurs was detained in Uzhhorod, who, according to special services, was preparing an assassination attempt on President Zelenskyy and riots in the government district of Kyiv. The information about the detention was confirmed by the head of the Zakarpattia Regional State Administration Viktor Mykyta.

Ukraine called on China on Saturday to join the West in condemning ""Russian barbarism"", as Moscow claimed it had struck a Ukrainian arms depot with hypersonic missiles in what would be the first use in combat of the next-generation weapons.

That attack, not far from the country's western Romanian border, came as Russia said its troops had broken through Ukrainian defences to enter the besieged southern port city of Mariupol, a scene of mounting desperation.

With the invasion in its fourth week, Kyiv's embattled leader Volodymyr Zelensky pressed for ""meaningful"" talks to halt fighting that has forced at least 3.3 million Ukrainians to flee their country.

The plea for China to condemn the invasion came from a top Zelensky advisor, Mikhailo Podolyak.

China could play an important role in global security, he said on Twitter, ""if it makes a right decision to support the civilised countries' coalition and condemn Russian barbarism.""

Russia's claim Saturday to have unleashed its new hypersonic Kinzhal missile would mark a dramatic new escalation of its campaign to force Ukraine to abandon hopes of closer ties with the West.

Ukrainian air force spokesman Yuri Ignat told AFP that the arms depot in the western village of Deliatyn had indeed been hit but ""we have no information of the type of missile"".

Russian President Vladimir Putin, who unveiled the Kinzhal missile in 2018, has termed it ""an ideal weapon"" that flies at 10 times the speed of sound, making it extremely difficult for missile defenses to intercept.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has opened up diplomatic and commercial opportunities for gas exporter Qatar to expand energy sales to the West and bolster its alliance with Washington amid U.S. tensions with other Gulf Arab states.

Qatar has sought a largely neutral stance on the conflict, but while trying to avoid choosing sides, it has signalled through its response that it can offer significant political and economic assistance to Western partners.

With many European energy importers looking urgently for ways to ease their heavy dependence on Russia, Qatar has suggested it could direct more gas in future to Europe.

Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in contrast have resisted Western calls for a rapid rise in oil output to contain a jump in crude prices caused by the conflict in Ukraine.

Australia expanded its sanctions against Russia over the invasion of Ukraine Sunday, immediately banning all exports of alumina and bauxite while pledging more weapons and humanitarian assistance.

The export ban aims to impact aluminium production in Russia, which relies on Australia for 20 percent of its alumina.

It comes just days after Canberra sanctioned oligarch Oleg Deripaska, who owns a stake in Queensland Alumina Limited -- a joint venture between Russian aluminium company Rusal and mining giant Rio Tinto, which has vowed to sever all business ties with Russia.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said his government was working with partners to ""put the maximum cost, the maximum pressure on the Putin regime to withdraw from Ukraine"".

Morrison said Australia had levelled 476 sanctions against Russian individuals and institutions since the invasion began.
