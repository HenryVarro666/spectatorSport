BRUSSELS, March 25 (Reuters) - Russia's ambassador to France was summoned on Friday to the French Foreign Ministry over an earlier embassy Twitter post that Paris deemed unacceptable, the foreign ministry said.

The Russian Embassy in Paris on Thursday had posted a picture depicting a body lying on a table called ""Europe"" with characters representing the United States and European Union jabbing needles into it.

""We made that clear today to the Russian Ambassador,"" the ministry said in a statement sent to Reuters. ""We are trying to maintain a demanding channel of dialogue with Russia and these actions are completely inappropriate.""

Speaking to reporters in Brussels, President Emmanuel Macron dismissed the cartoons as false propaganda.

""It's unacceptable. We believe in a respectful dialogue and will continue it and that means respect on all sides. It's a mistake. It's been corrected and I hope it won't happen again. We demanded it.""

France's European Affairs Minister Clement Beaune had slammed the cartoon post on Thursday calling it ""a disgrace"" in response to the drawing which had been posted earlier in the afternoon by the Twitter account of the Russia Embassy in France (@AmbRusFrance).

The picture has since been removed from the embassy's feed.

The drawing implied that the European continent was being destroyed by policies undertaken by the United States and the EU.

The needles, seen being jabbed into the body illustrating Europe, contained words such as ""NATO"", ""COVID-19"", ""Cancel Culture"" and ""Sanctions"".

The Russian Embassy in Paris had timed its publication of the cartoon to coincide with Thursday's unprecedented triple summit in Brussels of NATO, the G7 and the European Union to discuss how to tackle Russia's war in Ukraine.

“These publications are unacceptable. We have made it clear today to the Russian ambassador,” Alexei Meshkov, declared the French ministry.

The two images that provoked France's reaction were published on Thursday by the Russian embassy and subsequently deleted.

The drawing replicated in networks by the Russian diplomat shows Europeans on their knees licking the butt of Uncle Sam, the character who popularly symbolizes the United States, along with an English caption that reads: “This is what European solidarity is like.”

A second cartoon presents an allegory of sick Europe lying on a bed, while the United States and the European Union inject it with different substances called “neo-Nazism”, “Russophobia” or “covid-19″.

“We are striving to maintain a demanding channel of dialogue with Russia,” in the midst of the crisis between Moscow and the West over the Russian offensive in Ukraine, “but this is totally inappropriate behavior,” the ministry stressed.

The Russian embassy, contacted by AFP, confirmed that “the issue of the published tweet had been raised, among other points” during Friday morning's interview.

Another rod for Moldova

Meanwhile, the Russian Foreign Ministry summoned Moldavian ambassador to the country on Friday, Lilian Darii, to protest against the demonstration registered in front of the Russian Embassy in Chisinau in the midst of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In a statement, the Russian authorities indicated that the protest is an “outrageous action” against Russia. “The participants of the March 24 demonstration showed insulting slogans and carried out unacceptable actions,” the text says.

“According to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, the country hosting the Embassy is obliged to take measures to protect the legation and mission against intrusion or damage by third parties,” the Russian Government said, according to the TASS news agency, something that could in turn run for the Russian ambassador to France .

Thus, it has insisted that it is Chisinau's job to “prevent any act that disturbs the peace of the mission or its dignity” and has demanded that Moldova comply with its international obligations and take “proportionate” measures.

Western leaders met in Brussels to strengthen their forces in Eastern Europe, increase military aid to Ukraine and tighten their sanctions on Russia as Moscow's assault on its neighbour entered its second month.

Meanwhile, Western nations continued to crank up the cost of war for Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Germany’s economy minister said Friday that his country has forged contracts with new suppliers that will allow it to significantly reduce its reliance on Russian coal, gas and oil in the coming weeks.

The U.S. also announced a new round of sanctions targeting 48 state-owned defense companies, 328 members of the Duma, Russia’s lower parliament, and dozens of Russian elites. The White House said the efforts were designed to blunt Russia’s ability to use its international reserves to fund the war.

Britain on Thursday sanctioned 65 more companies and individuals over the invasion. The targets include Russia’s largest private bank and a woman who the British government says is the stepdaughter of Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

On Friday, Lavrov described Western efforts to sanction Russia internationally as ""total war.""

French President Emmanuel Macron has sought to keep dialogue with Russian President Vladimir Putin and continues to speak regularly with him as part of efforts to get a ceasefire and begin a credible negotiation between Kyiv and Moscow.

Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Moscow is facing total war declared by the West.

Lavrov said at a meeting on Friday that “a real hybrid war, total war was declared on us.” He said the goal was “to destroy, break, annihilate, strangle the Russian economy, and Russia on the whole.”

During the first month of what Russia describes as a “special military operation” in Ukraine, the West imposed tough measures targeting Russia’s economy and financial system as well as President Vladimir Putin and Russian oligarchs.

Despite that, Lavrov said Russia was not isolated.

“We have many friends, allies, partners in the world, a huge number of associations in which Russia is working with countries of all continents, and we will continue to do so,” Lavrov said. He added that the vast majority of states won’t join the Western sanctions policy against Russia.
