Many NATO aircraft airborne. B-52 over Poland.

On Feb. 24, 2022, few hours after Putin ordered a massive attack on Ukraine (that we have covered here), six U.S. F-35A Lightning II among the 12 operating from Germany, were forward deployed to the Baltic Sea and Black Sea region, in support of NATO‚Äôs collective defense.

The aircraft, belonging to the 34th Fighter Squadron, from Hill Air Force Base, Utah, had arrived at Spangdahlem Air Base on Feb. 16, 2022 to bolster NATO‚Äôs eastern flank. They will operate ‚Äúfor a period of time‚Äù from Estonia‚Äôs Amari Air Base, Lithuania‚Äôs Siauliai Air Base, and Romania‚Äôs Fetesti Air Base: two F-35s for each of these forward operating locations.

The move had already been in the plans, considered that on Feb. 22, Secretary Austin ordered the additional movement of U.S. forces already stationed in Europe to continue Washington‚Äôs support for NATO Allies on the eastern regions. Among these, an infantry battalion task force of approximately 800 personnel, from Italy to the Baltic region; movement of up to eight F-35 Strike Fighters from Germany to several operating locations along NATO‚Äôs eastern flank; a battalion of attack aviation ‚Äì 20 AH-64 helicopters ‚Äì from Germany to the Baltic region; and an attack aviation task force ‚Äì 12 AH-64 helicopters ‚Äì will move from Greece to Poland.

‚ÄúWe are facing a dynamic environment, and the deployment of F-35s to NATO‚Äôs eastern flank enhances our defensive posture and amplifies the Alliance‚Äôs interoperability,‚Äù said Gen. Jeff Harrigian, U.S. Air Force in Europe ‚Äì Air Forces Africa commander in a public release.

The U.S. Air Force F-35s are not the only Lightning II rushed to the region. The Royal Netherlands Air Force has also deployed two F-35As to Bulgaria as part of a larger deployment of forces that include also RNLAF F-16s. The deployment was initially planned for the March/April timeframe, but it was brought forward following the worsening of the crisis in Ukraine.

Generally speaking, we have observed a spike in the military air activity over Poland, Romania and Hungary, with lots of ISR (Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance) aircraft, including British and U.S. Rivet Joints, U.S. E-8J JSTARS, and several tankers. Consider that along with those that can be tracked online, there are many more that we can‚Äôt see on flight tracking websites!

Two U.S. Air Force B-52 Stratofortress bombers launched from RAF Fairford: one, callsign NOBLE 41 flew over Scandinavia, while the other, callsign NOBLE 42, headed eastbound and orbited for some time over Poland, not far from the border with Belarus.

Last but not least, some images of the Ukrainian Su-27 that (probably) fled to Romania where it was intercepted by two Romanian Air Force F-16s were released.

On Thursday, a Su-27 Ukrainian Air Force was escorted by two F-16s Romanian Air Force after entering Romania‚Äôs airspace. The Su-27 landed at 95th Airbase BacƒÉu at 07:05 LT.

The scope and speed of Russia‚Äôs military reach into the country has prompted Western officials to quickly decide on next steps, after weeks of vowing not to send reinforcements into Ukraine itself.

Six U.S. F-35A Lightning II fighter jets deployed from Germany to multiple countries on NATO‚Äôs eastern flank on Thursday for air policing flights in solidarity with the transatlantic alliance. They‚Äôll disperse alongside F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-15 Eagle fighter jets across Poland, Estonia, Lithuania and Romania, U.S. Air Forces in Europe said.

The presence of the Air Force‚Äôs most advanced fighter jet signals a swift response if Russia expands its offensive outside Ukraine‚Äôs borders and into NATO countries. The F-35A can act as a quarterback to pass targeting information and other data between other U.S. and NATO fighters in the region, should the alliance need to react quickly to Russian aggression.

The six F-35As come after the Defense Department promised on Tuesday to send up to eight Lightning IIs that had arrived at Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany from Hill Air Force Base, Utah.

‚ÄúWhy are they in the Baltics? It‚Äôs assurance, deterrence and, quite frankly, I think they‚Äôll do training as well, depending on how the situation evolves,‚Äù a senior F-35 official said Wednesday. Air Force Times is withholding their name because they were not authorized to speak to the press.

That training involves working out the kinks in sharing targeting data and other sensor information between the F-35A and European jets, they said. The official expects multiple types of fighters running tactics drills together to ensure everyone is up to speed.

‚ÄúEurope‚Äôs going to have 500 F-35s. Only 50 of those are going to be U.S. airplanes at [RAF Lakenheath, England], give or take,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúIt has to be seamless with our partners.‚Äù

The F-35As are likely collecting information about activity in the surrounding area through their sensors as well, while avoiding being tracked themselves, the official added.

‚ÄúThey want to make sure that they‚Äôre communicating across the data links and sharing the right information. ‚ÄòIs this working? Are there any anomalies?‚Äô‚Äù the F-35 official said of training. ‚ÄúThe other 50% of it is honing the tactics.‚Äù

The official doubts U.S. fighters would enter Ukrainian airspace or fire weapons.

They official estimated that about 200 people likely stayed at Spangdahlem while another 100 airmen moved farther east in a ‚Äúhub-and-spoke‚Äù deployment intended to be more flexible in an emergency. That model keeps the bulk of military forces at an established installation like a brick-and-mortar base or an aircraft carrier, but sends a smaller group out to set up camp closer to the intended mission.

Among those headed to the potential front lines may be Hill‚Äôs specialized cadre of versatile maintainers who know all about fixing the jets, known as the Lightning Technician Program.

‚ÄúI would expect them to retrograde back to [Germany] at some point because I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre taking a lot of their spare parts and stuff with them,‚Äù the official said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a short duration, but they can tailor that however they want.‚Äù

The scenario and conditions are likely close to what the airmen have trained to face while at home, the source said.

‚ÄúWhen you take a [fifth-generation] fighter, you‚Äôre certainly going to go to a prepared airfield,‚Äù they said, noting the troops may be living in tents at the Baltic bases. ‚ÄúThe minimum requirements were water, shelter and fuel. Hopefully there‚Äôs weapons there if you had to reload.‚Äù

Lt. Col. Tyson Wetzel, an Air Force intelligence officer and military strategist currently serving as an Atlantic Council fellow, said in an online briefing late Wednesday the force the United States and NATO has amassed in Eastern Europe is enough to give Russian President Vladimir Putin pause before expanding a military campaign beyond Ukraine.

Russian jets early Thursday took out military facilities and surface-to-air missile launchers that protect Ukraine from overhead attack, allowing them to patrol the skies so their ground and naval forces can move around the country more freely.

RELATED

The opening moves of the Russian air campaign likely aimed to sever military units‚Äô ties to their commanders ‚Äî ‚Äúcut the head off of the snake, if you will,‚Äù Wetzel said. Interrupting Ukrainian troops‚Äô access to command, their leaders‚Äô control, and communications more broadly can hurt their ability to slow Russia‚Äôs advance.

Experts said ahead of the invasion the air defense systems were perhaps the most vulnerable aspect of Ukraine‚Äôs military protection.

‚ÄúThe United States set the tone for this type of attack in 1991 in the opening hours of [Operation] Desert Storm,‚Äù Wetzel said. ‚ÄúIt is a methodology that still works today.‚Äù

Russia could control Ukraine‚Äôs skies within 48 to 72 hours as a precursor to ‚Äúsoftening up resistance to allow for the ground invasion,‚Äù Wetzel projected.

‚ÄúThe Ukrainian Air Force, which is small and has some older aircraft, but is still a very capable, professional force, I‚Äôm sure they will rise to meet some of the Russian aircraft,‚Äù he added, predicting air-to-air combat between the two nations will ensue.

U.S. Air Forces in Europe and NATO declined to comment directly on reports of possible aerial dogfighting between Ukrainian and Russian jets.

If Putin successfully annexes the entire country, NATO countries would comprise nearly all of Russia‚Äôs western border ‚Äî boosting the risk of cross-border confrontation that could draw the alliance‚Äôs 30 countries into a fight.

Since the 2014 invasion of Crimea, the military has sought to bolster infrastructure in Europe that would allow it to deter or quickly respond to Russian aggression. The Air Force, in particular, has funded construction at NATO bases so it can more easily deploy aircraft to Eastern Europe.

But despite years of renewed focus there, progress remains piecemeal.

The American F-35As arriving at Amari Air Base in Estonia will find a new tactical fighter aircraft parking apron and taxiway, built to allow the base to support the F-35, as well as the Air Force‚Äôs other fighter aircraft and the A-10 Thunderbolt II attack plane.

Those projects and others across the continent were paid for by the European Deterrence Initiative, a pot of Pentagon funding set aside for NATO-related infrastructure improvements.

Upgrades to Amari‚Äôs parking apron, hazardous cargo pad, dorm building and squadron operations facility are all complete, USAFE said in an email Thursday, and improvements to its refueling infrastructure are slated to wrap up within the next year.

Other construction projects are further behind.

At Kecskemet Air Base in Hungary, jobs to improve fuel storage, taxiway construction and other infrastructure to accommodate F-15s, A-10s and C-5s ‚Äúwere paused for several months due to a hold on funding,‚Äù USAFE said. The Air Force hopes to gather industry bids on the work this summer.

A parking apron expansion at Malacky Air Base in Slovakia, meant to accommodate A-10s and F-15s, is moving forward after the country signed a military treaty with the U.S. this month. Designs were on hold for a year, but are now being ‚Äúrefreshed,‚Äù USAFE said, with a construction contract award to come.

Another project to build a new taxiway at Rygge Air Station in Norway is on hold, USAFE said. The service hopes it can revive the project in a later year.

Other possible plans for new builds are too early in the process to tell whether the Air Force will move forward with finding contractors.

To reduce its reliance on brick-and-mortar installations, the Air Force in 2016 began pursuing ‚Äúbase-in-a-box‚Äù kits ‚Äî formally known as ‚ÄúDeployable Air Base System-Facilities, Equipment and Vehicles‚Äù (DABS) kits. Ideally, the kits would include the essentials for airmen in Europe to respond to Russia on short notice.

RELATED

But in 2019, an inspector general report said management problems hampered the DABS program and put it considerably behind schedule. The initial plan was to construct the first storage facility by 2019, but the IG found it wouldn‚Äôt be ready until 2022.

The project has stalled further since then. USAFE said the first DABS project was designed to be placed in Sanem, Luxembourg, a central storage and logistics station, but the work was deferred due to lack of funds.

The money has since been restored, USAFE said, and the Air Force aims to award a contract for the project in the next year.

Other DABS kits are planned for Campia Turzii, Romania, which hosts American MQ-9 Reaper drones, and other bases that await revised kit designs and construction bids.

‚ÄúAssuring our allies that we‚Äôre there with them is No. 1,‚Äù the senior F-35 official said. ‚ÄúHopefully, that assurance will also lead to deterrence, or at least the Russians may think twice.‚Äù

For weeks, aviation spotters have been following the Air Force‚Äôs RQ-4 Global Hawk, RC-135 Rivet Joint, WC-135 Constant Phoenix and E-8C, an Army prototype called ARTEMIS, as well as other U.S. and NATO aircraft flying in Ukraine or in neighboring areas.

The aircraft flight paths are not classified and are readily viewable on commercial websites.

The specialized planes flying in or near Ukraine can provide real-time intelligence on land and sea movements and intercept Russian communications.

A remotely piloted Global Hawk with the call sign FORTE12 was the last aircraft tracked over Ukraine before the country shut down its airspace to civilian air traffic a few hours before dawn Thursday, according to the global flight tracking service Flightradar24.

It was spotted with another U.S. Global Hawk, call sign FORTE11, on Wednesday evening over eastern Ukraine. On Thursday morning, aviation watchers spotted FORTE12 flying southwest of Crimea over the Black Sea.

Based out of Naval Air Station Sigonella on the Italian island of Sicily, the two planes have been frequent visitors to Ukraine over the past month, according to Flightradar24 data.

The site observed that FORTE11 had arrived in Ukrainian airspace late Wednesday morning and noted that the last time it was in Ukraine, on Feb. 20, it stayed for 24 hours.

The Global Hawk can fly at high altitudes for more than 30 hours without refueling, according to the drone‚Äôs manufacturer, Northrop Grumman. Its cameras can gather nearly real-time, high-resolution imagery of large areas in all types of weather, day or night, the company says.

Air Force officials in Europe would not comment Wednesday on the specifics of surveillance aircraft flying in or near Ukraine, citing Defense Department policy.

The Air Force conducts ‚Äúthese types of flights with allies and partners routinely and only with prior approval from and full coordination with respective host nations,‚Äù said Tech. Sgt. Michael Battles, a spokesman for U.S. Air Forces in Europe‚ÄìAir Forces Africa.

Surveillance and reconnaissance missions continued Thursday following Russia‚Äôs missile attacks on facilities in or near Ukraine‚Äôs major cities, including the capital of Kyiv.

The CivMilAir Twitter tracking site observed an American E-8C and RC-135 Rivet Joint plus ARTEMIS watching the western borders of Belarus and Ukraine late Thursday morning.

The E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System, or JSTARS, departed from Ramstein Air Base and was tracked over Poland and Romania.

The aircraft was conceived during the Cold War to locate and track moving ground targets in all weather conditions, manufacturer Northrop Grumman says.

Its 24-foot-long radar antenna can be tilted to either side of the aircraft, allowing it a 120-degree field of view covering about 19,000 square miles.

A British Rivet Joint plane was spotted with its U.S. Air Force counterpart Thursday morning over Eastern Europe. The aircraft‚Äôs sensors soak up electronic emissions from communications systems, radar and the like, according to Britain‚Äôs Royal Air Force.

ARTEMIS, which stands for Aerial Reconnaissance and Targeting Exploitation Multi-Mission Intelligence System, is the Army‚Äôs first manned intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance jet.

It is a Bombardier Challenger 650 ‚Äúthat‚Äôs been souped up with military-grade sensors for tracking ground troops‚Äù and is flown on the Army‚Äôs behalf by defense contractor Leidos, according to a Breaking Defense article published Tuesday.

Its electronics and ground-scanning radar can monitor tanks from hundreds of miles away, meaning it can see into Belarus, the heavily fortified Russian exclave of Kaliningrad and maybe even the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, Tom Spoehr, director of the Heritage Foundation‚Äôs center for national defense, said in the article.

Meanwhile, the Air Force‚Äôs WC-135 Constant Phoenix, nicknamed the ‚Äúnuke sniffer,‚Äù spent time patrolling Eastern Europe this week. Its mission is to detect and collect radioactivity samples in the atmosphere. The radioactivity typically results from a nuclear explosion.

The aircraft, based at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska, made an emergency landing Tuesday at RAF Mildenhall, England, following a flight over the Baltic Sea.

Air Force officials said the crew followed all prescribed emergency and safety procedures and landed safely. No one on board was injured.",https://www.stripes.com/theaters/europe/2022-02-24/us-spy-planes-doing-double-duty-as-russia-raises-the-stakes-in-ukraine-5129043.html
