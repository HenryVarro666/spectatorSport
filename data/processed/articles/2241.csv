The latest: Hours after the speech, Putin invaded Ukraine — including attacking the capital, Kyiv — in an overnight barrage that was swift, broad and ruthless.

Ukraine entered a state of emergency on Wednesday as the Pentagon warned that Russia's preparations for invasion appeared to be complete, and Ukrainian citizens prepared for war.

After Putin's speech, explosions were heard in cities including Kyiv.

What he's saying: In the final hours before the invasion began, Zelensky revealed that he had tried to call Putin but been met with ""silence."" He addressed the Russian people in Russian to make an appeal for peace, while acknowledging the need to prepare for war.

After Putin's invasion order, the smallest spark could start a ""big war"" and ""burn everything down,"" he said, adding: ""You are told that this flame will liberate the people of Ukraine, but the Ukrainian people are free.""

Zelensky said the Russian people have been told he and his citizens are Nazis, despite the fact that his grandfather fought the Nazis in the Soviet infantry.

He said Russians have falsely been told both that Ukrainians hate Russian culture and have no culture of their own. ""We are different, but that is not a reason to be enemies,"" he said.

He said Ukraine had never been and never will be a threat to Russia, and while Russia would never allow his speech to be shown on Russian television, ""the people of Russia need to see it.""

Between the lines: Zelensky's speech was a clear rebuttal to Putin's combative and historically revisionist hour-long address on Monday, in which he effectively asserted Russia's right to bend Ukraine to its will and erase its independence.

Zelensky spent weeks downplaying the risk of an imminent invasion in order to avoid panic, but has now adopted the tone of a president preparing his country for war.

Vice President Kamala Harris threatened further sanctions on Russia for the country’s aggressive actions in Ukraine if “Russia goes further” in the region, calling the situation on the ground a “reinvasion.”

“As you know, we have imposed significant costs in response to Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine, and we are working closely with our partners and allies in that regard,” the vice president said, ahead of a meeting with leaders from the National Black Caucus of State Legislators on Wednesday.

She warned the “threat of a full-scale attack on Ukraine remains,” and added that the administration would “remain vigilant in watching what is happening there”

“If Russia goes further,” Harris said, “we will impose more costs that will be swift and severe.”

Last week: Harris vowed there would be a ""swift, severe and united"" response if Russia invades Ukraine and assured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky the US ""stands with Ukraine,” as CNN reported.

In remarks at the Munich Security Conference in Germany, Harris laid out retaliatory measures in a manner befitting her past career as a prosecutor, promising ""significant and unprecedented"" economic costs.

Volodymyr Zelensky might have thought he belonged to the league of exceptions when he became Ukraine’s president in 2019. Not too many actors have seen that much success in the world of politics Donald Trump and Ronald Regan of the US are some recent examples.

For spies, brutal realities of nationalism are the world they operate in. Russia’s President Vladimir Putin lived in a contrastingly different world from which Zelensky came into politics. And theirs has been a tussle between a hardcore ruthlessly nationalist politician and a comedian-turned-political greenhorn.

VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY

Zelensky lived a reel life in the politically turbulent space of Ukraine when he ran for the presidential election in 2019. Till then, Zelensky was best known for his satirical television series, Servants of the People. He played the character of a teacher who accidentally became the president of Ukraine.

The TV series had established him as a comedian-actor in Ukraine. Zelensky was a millionaire thanks to his production company and had millions of followers on social media. But in civil war-ridden Ukraine, Zelensky decided to take on business-turned-politician Petro Poroshenko in the presidential election.

BBC reported that Zelensky avoided discussing serious issues during his election campaign and depended on posting light comic videos on social media as part of his canvassing plan. On one occasion, he left then Ukraine’s President Petro Poroshenko and a candidate in the election to ‘debate’ with an empty podium. Volodymyr Zelensky did not turn up for the televised debate.

Zelensky secured almost three-fourths of votes, catapulting the comedian-actor with no experience whatsoever in politics and administration to the top post in Ukraine. On the other side of the border, in the east, was a seasoned Vladimir Putin.

HOW PUTIN RESPONDED

Russia welcomed Zelensky’s election as Ukraine’s president, saying that the Putin government wanted him to show “sound judgement”, “honesty” and “pragmatism” to improve bilateral relations.

Poroshenko was considered an anti-Russia president who had taken over in 2014 from pro-Russian Victor Yanukovych following violent protests in Kyiv and the rest of Ukraine. Back then, Putin had ordered the annexation of Crimea.

Zelensky had promised to renew ties with Russia in the election but with decision-making independent of Russia.

Three days after Zelensky’s victory, Putin signed a government order for issuing passports to people living in eastern Ukraine, in areas controlled by rebels. Zelensky’s team called Russia “an aggressor state which wages war against Ukraine”.

Putin defended the passport offer, saying there was “nothing unusual” about it as Russia was only taking care of Russians living in Ukraine. All this happened in April 2019.

A TRUMP ANGLE

In July 2019, Zelensky turned to US President Donald Trump, seeking an audience in the White House over American support in countering Russia in Ukraine.

This was apparently when Trump asked Zelensky for “a favour” a probe into his then-presidential election challenger Joe Biden and his son in connection with an energy company. This “favour” request led to Trump’s impeachment in December 2019.

In July itself, Trump had ‘blocked’ the US military aid to Ukraine as Zelensky struggled to deal with Putin’s ‘aggression’ in East Ukraine. Trump reportedly asked Zelensky to sort out his issues with Putin in a friendly manner. The aid was delayed for several months.

KIEV TO KYIV

For years, Ukraine’s capital was spelt as Kiev. Zelensky, in September 2019, moved to change the spelling to Kyiv, leaving commentators recalling William Shakespeare’s famous line: “What’s in the name?”

Here it was a Ukraine and a Russia in the capital’s spelling. Kyiv is the Latin transliteration of the city’s name in the Ukrainian language, which lost its place in what is called ‘Russification’ during the 19th and 20th centuries.

Ukrainian is the official language of Ukraine, which has adopted Latin standards for spelling names in place of Cyrillic (used for Slavic languages, including Russian).

Kiev was the Russian way of pronouncing and spelling the Ukrainian capital’s name. It became popular during the times of the Russian Empire and continued during Soviet rule. Zelensky dropped this Russian tag for a nationalistic one.

But Kyiv has a nationalist appeal not only to Ukraine but to Russia and Belarus as well. It was the centre of the first Slavic state called Kyivian Rus also called the birthplace of Russia and Ukraine founded in 988 AD.

PUTIN’S DRIVE

Zelensky’s promise to end the war with the rebels in East Ukraine suffered multiple jolts, with Russia keeping supplies running to the separatist fighters.

In 2021, Putin sent about 1 lakh troops to the Ukraine border, prompting Zelensky to renew the call for finalising a timeline for Ukraine’s entry to Nato. It has been lingering on since 2008 when it was promised membership.

Two months after sending troops to the border, Putin wrote an article declaring the Russians and Ukrainians a one nation. In his article, Putin said, “Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians are all descendants of Ancient Rus, which was the largest state in Europe.”

“The name ‘Ukraine’ was used more often in the meaning of the Old Russian word ‘okraina [periphery]’, which is found in written sources from the 12th century, referring to various border territories. And the word ‘Ukrainian’, judging by archival documents, originally referred to frontier guards who protected the external borders,” said Putin.

Putin left no doubt that he considered Ukraine a Russian front which his government was obliged to guard against Nato or even a president, who was ‘too novice’ to understand his geostrategic nuances.

Russian troops kept assembling on the Ukraine border through 2021 and from January 2022, war loomed large on the European horizon.

In February, Russia and Belarus conducted a joint military exercise near the Ukraine border about 550 km from capital Kyiv. Putin followed it up by recognising two rebel-controlled regions independent in another nudge to Zelensky this week.

You have been told that this flame will bring liberation to Ukraine’s people. But the Ukrainian people are free. They remember their own past and will build their own future. They build, they do not destroy, as they themselves have told you day after day on television. The Ukraine in your news and the Ukraine of real life are two entirely different places, and the difference is that the latter is real.

They tell you that we’re Nazis. But how can a people that lost 8 million lives to defeat the Nazis support Nazism? How can I be a Nazi? Say it to my grandfather, who fought in World War II as a Soviet infantryman and died a colonel in an independent Ukraine. They tell you that we hate Russian culture. How can one hate a culture? Any culture? Neighbors always enrich each other’s cultures. However, we are not part of one whole. You cannot swallow us up. We are different. But this difference is not a reason for enmity. We want to determine our own course and build our own history: peacefully, calmly, and honestly.

They told you that I would order an attack on Donbass, order indiscriminate shootings and bombings. This leads to some questions, some very simple ones. Who are we shooting at? What are we bombing? Donetsk, which I have visited dozens of times? Where I looked in people’s faces, in their eyes? Artyoma Street, where I strolled with friends? The Donbass Arena, where I rooted for our boys together with Ukrainian lads at the European Championships? Shcherbakov Park, where I drank with friends when our boys lost? Luhansk, where the mother of my best friend is buried? Where his father also rests? Take note that I am speaking to you all in Russian now, but no one in Russia knows the meaning of these places, these streets, these names, these events. These are all alien to you, unfamiliar.

This is our land, and this is our history. What will you fight for and with whom? Many of you have visited Ukraine. Many of you have relatives here. Some might have studied at Ukrainian universities and befriended Ukrainians. You know our character, you know our people, and you know our principles. You know what we value. So stop and listen to yourselves, to the voice of reason, to the voice of common sense.

Hear us. The Ukrainian people want peace, as does their government. Not only do they want it, but they demonstrate that desire for peace. They do everything they can. We are not alone: It is the truth that Ukraine is supported by many nations. Why? It is not about peace at any cost. It is about peace and principles, of justice, of international law. It is about the right to self-determination, that every person might determine their own future. It is the right of every society, and of every person, to security, to a life without threats. I am certain that these rights are important to you, as well.

The truth is that this needs to end before it is too late. If Russia’s leadership does not want to meet us across the table for the sake of peace, perhaps it will sit at that table with you. Do you Russians want a war? I would very much like to know the answer, but that answer depends only on you, on the citizens of the Russian Federation. Thank you for your attention.

Until his surprise election in 2019, Volodymyr Zelenskyy played a president on TV.

Today, the 44-year-old is leading Ukraine as it faces an invasion from Russia, facing a threat to his rule and perhaps his life, from President Vladimir Putin.

Addressing Ukrainians on television Thursday, at the end of the first day of the invasion, Zelenskyy said he had information Russia ""has identified me as target No. 1 and my family as No. 2.""

""They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state,"" the president said in the televised speech.

Zelenskyy's life and career have been anything but typical compared to other international leaders, and he has faced a seemingly unending series of crises since taking office.

Zelenskyy, who is married and has two children, graduated from the Kyiv National Economic University in 2000 with a law degree, but he decided to pursue a different career.

He formed the comedy troupe Kvartal 95 with other actors in 1997 and in 2003, the group began producing television programs.

In 2015, Zelenskyy began starring in the role that would set him on the path to the presidency. In the show ""Servant of the People,"" he played Vasyl Petrovych Holoborodko, a school teacher who wakes up to find that a rant he made against corrupt politicians went viral and catapulted him to the presidency.

Holoborodko was often portrayed as being in over his head, but willing to fight corruption.

The show was so popular that it led to Kvartal 95 creating a political party in its name.

In 2018, Zelenskyy abruptly moved into real politics and announced his candidacy for president under the Servant of the People party. During his campaign, he continued touring with his troupe and mocked his opponents in stand-up routines.

Zelenskyy also took to social media to promote his campaign and platform. His attitude was similar to his TV character as he vowed to crack down on corruption and promote a more centrist administration.

He went on to win the election in a landslide, taking over 73% of the vote, after running on a platform to end the war with Russia and its separatist proxies in eastern Ukraine.

He was inaugurated in May 2019.

Two months later, Zelenskyy would become entangled in a major U.S. scandal involving then-President Donald Trump.

News emerged that Trump had called Zelenskyy and pressured him to work with Rudy Giuliani and then-Attorney General William Barr to investigate Joe Biden, who was then running against Trump in the presidential election, and his son Hunter. Trump withheld $400 million in congressional aid to Ukraine when Ukrainian officials didn't comply.

Trump denied any wrongdoing, repeatedly saying it was a ""perfect call,"" but a congressional investigation led to Trump's impeachment later that year. He was acquitted in the Senate in February 2020.

Zelenskyy has had a more amicable relationship with Biden since he took over the presidency and visited the White House last year.

Zelenskyy led his country as COVID-19 ravaged the world. He would test positive for the virus in November and was hospitalized for three days.

He came to office promising to find a way to resolve the eight-year conflict in eastern Ukraine with the Russian-controlled separatists there. He initially tried to engage with Putin diplomatically, but was treated coldly by the Russian leader.

In the past year, under pressure politically during the COVID-19 crisis, Zelenskyy had taken a harder line against pro-Russian political factions in Ukraine, including Viktor Medvedchuk, known as Putin's man in Ukraine.

Russia's military buildup against Ukraine began around the same time Zelenskyy moved to sanction Medvedchuk and TV stations linked to him.

He has denied all allegations by Putin and Russian-controlled separatists that he is provoking war and made an impassioned plea in Russian on Feb. 23 for that country's people to reject the aggression.

""We don't need war. Not a cold one, nor a hot one, nor a hybrid one,"" Zelenskyy said during his speech.

Putin has claimed his military operation in Ukraine is aimed in part at ""de-Nazification"" of the country, playing on a false narrative that Western-leaning politicians are sympathetic to fascism.

Zelenskyy is Jewish and three of his great uncles were killed in the Holocaust.

Zelenskyy for now has said he will remain in Kyiv and has continued to post video addresses during the invasion.

During his speech on Wednesday, Zelenskyy switched from Ukrainian into Russian, appealing directly to Russians for peace, saying their leadership was leading them into a senseless war.

""I know that Russian TV won't show my speech. But citizens of Russia need to see it. They need to see the truth. The truth is you need to stop before it's too late,"" he said.

A few hours later, missile strikes began hitting Kyiv.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday declared war on Ukraine and pledged to oversee a “demilitarization and de-Nazification” of the country — which is led by a Jewish president.

Hours before Putin’s televised address, Volodymyr Zelenskiy had delivered his own final, powerful but ultimately fruitless plea for peace, in which he pushed back at Putin’s unfounded accusations that Ukraine was being run by Nazis.

Addressing the Russian public directly and in Russian, his native language, Zelenskiy said: “The Ukraine on your news and Ukraine in real life are two completely different countries — and the main difference between them is: Ours is real. You are told we are Nazis. But could a people who lost more than 8 million lives in the battle against Nazism support Nazism?”

After a pregnant pause, Zelenskiy, who is Jewish — though he did not explicitly say that in the video — added: “How can I be a Nazi? Explain it to my grandfather, who went through the entire war in the infantry of the Soviet army, and died a colonel in an independent Ukraine.”

The Ukrainian president has said that three of his grandfather’s brothers were killed in the Holocaust.

Zelenskiy called on Russians to consider the cost of war and debunked Putin’s talking points.

“What are you fighting for and with whom?” Zelenskiy asked Russians. “Many of you have been to Ukraine. Many of you have family in Ukraine. Some have studied in Ukrainian universities. Some have been friends with Ukrainians. You know our character. You know our people. You know our principles. You know what we value. So listen to yourselves. Listen to reason.”",https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-jewish-president-volodymyr-zelenskiy-how-could-i-be-a-nazi-vladimir-putin-war/

The U.S. government is prepared to help Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky leave Kyiv to avoid being captured or killed by advancing Russian forces, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials. But so far, the president has refused to go. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight As the Russian military ratcheted up its attacks on Friday, a defiant Zelensky pledged to remain in charge of his government despite grave personal risk. “According to the information we have, the enemy has marked me as target No. 1, my family as target No. 2,” he told Ukrainians in an early-morning address. “They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state.”

For weeks, Zelensky has heard those warnings from U.S. officials.

When CIA Director William J. Burns flew to Ukraine in January to meet with Zelensky about the growing Russian threat to his country, the Ukrainian president asked whether he or his family were personally in danger, according to a Zelensky aide, who said that the leader was skeptical the Russians would try to kill him.

Burns didn’t share specific information but made clear that Zelensky needed to take his personal security seriously, the aide said.

The CIA declined to comment.

At the time, intelligence suggested that Russian hit teams might already be in Kyiv, well before the first forces ever crossed the border, according to officials familiar with the information who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive material.

U.S. officials in recent days have spoken to Zelensky about a variety of security issues, including the safest places for the president to situate himself to ensure continuity of the Ukrainian government, said a senior U.S. official.

“We have been making him aware not only of the threat of Russian invasion, now a reality, but also the threat to him personally,” Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said. “We stand ready to assist him in any way.”

Removing Zelensky might offer Russian President Vladimir Putin the swiftest way to end the war in Ukraine or avoid a protracted, costly occupation, several current and former national security officials said this week.

With the Ukrainian leader out of the picture, Putin could try to install a puppet replacement.

In January, the British government accused the Kremlin of scheming to replace Zelensky with a pro-Russian politician and former member of Ukraine’s parliament.

Schiff said he worried that if the Russians captured Zelensky, they could hold him incommunicado or force him to make concessions.

“I’m deeply concerned with the threat to his life and well being,” Schiff said.

As the Biden administration and Western allies warned an invasion was coming, Zelensky publicly downplayed the threat. He and his aides acknowledged that Putin might order the forces massing in huge numbers on Ukraine’s borders to strike, but they said U.S. and other European leaders also risked igniting a public panic and economic catastrophe with their constant warnings of an imminent attack.

Now that Russia has struck, U.S. officials warned again this week that Putin’s goal was to decapitate the Ukrainian government. White House press secretary Jen Psaki indicated to reporters on Thursday that the United States had plans to assist Zelensky if he were personally threatened.

“We’re not going to get into security — security questions, but we are in touch with President Zelensky, and we are working to provide him a range of support,” Psaki said.

According to a Ukrainian official, Zelensky has not directed his own security services to remove him to a safe city, such as Lviv, although they stand ready to do so.

Fending off rumors that he had fled, Zelensky posted a video on Telegram on Friday surrounded by his top advisers and the prime minister in front of Bankova, Ukraine’s equivalent to the White House.

“We are all here. Defending our independence. Our country. And so it will continue,” Zelensky said.

Zelensky noted in his earlier remarks that his family remained in Ukraine, as well, but he declined to say where.

He also said that “sabotage groups” had infiltrated Kyiv, without saying whether they were targeting him personally.

Later, Zelensky’s administration said in a public statement that “enemy reconnaissance and sabotage groups operate insidiously, disguising themselves in civilian clothes and infiltrating cities to destabilize the situation by carrying out sabotage operations.”

Some officials praised the Ukrainian leader for staying in place despite the risk to himself and his government and the warnings he has received.

“The U.S. has been very forward-leaning both in sharing threat information with the government of Ukraine, including President Zelensky, as well as declassifying a significant amount of intelligence to ensure that the world knew about Russia’s plans for this unprovoked aggression,” said Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. “President Zelensky has courageously decided to stay and lead from Kyiv.”
