The owner put the club up for sale on March 2 but this is now on hold due to the the sanctioning.

The UK Government have released a statement confirming the sanctioning of Abramovich.

The club have been given a special licence to continue with football related activities but the sale effectively bars the sale of the club following Roman Abramovich’s sanctioning.

In a statement released by gov.uk, it states: ""Given the significant impact that today’s sanctions would have on Chelsea football club and the potential knock on effects of this, the Government has this morning published a licence which authorises a number of football-related activities to continue at Chelsea.

""This includes permissions for the club to continue playing matches and other football related activity which will in turn protect the Premier League, the wider football pyramid, loyal fans and other clubs. This licence will only allow certain explicitly named actions to ensure the designated individual is not able to circumvent UK sanctions. The licence will be kept under constant review and we will work closely with the football authorities.""

It remains to be seen as to what this means for the future of Chelsea Football Club, with 20 credible parties interested in purchasing the club from Abramovich.

Furthermore, only season ticket holders will now be able to attend matches with no more tickets allowed to be sold during the sanctioning.

This throws the future of the club into doubt, with more to follow regarding the sanctioning.

Abramovich has had his assets frozen, including Chelsea FC which he had put up for sale eight days earlier.

Abramovich was one of seven Russian oligarchs sanctioned on Thursday, with the government targeting individuals believed to be close to Russian president Vladimir Putin.

In the statement Abramovich made when he outlined his intention to sell the club, the 55-year-old had vowed to pass on ""all net proceeds"" from the sale to a new charitable foundation to help ""all victims of the war in Ukraine"".

Abramovich denies allegations that he is close to Putin.

But he was believed to be aware that sanctions were a possibility as he was said to want a fast sale, despite valuing Chelsea FC at around £3 billion.

Billionaires including Nick Candy, Hansjorg Wyss and Todd Boehly had all showed interest in buying the club but their proposals have now been put on hold.

However, the Daily Mail has suggested that the government could still permit the sale of Chelsea as long as Abramovich does not benefit financially.

Nadine Dorries, who is the UK's Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, wrote on Twitter on Thursday: ""Putin's attack on Ukraine continues & we are witnessing new levels of evil by the hour.

""Today the Government has announced further sanctions against individuals linked to the Russian Government. This list includes Roman Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea Football Club.

""Our priority is to hold those who have enabled the Putin regime to account. Today’s sanctions obviously have a direct impact on Chelsea & its fans. We have been working hard to ensure the club & the national game are not unnecessarily harmed by these important sanctions.

""To ensure the club can continue to compete and operate we are issuing a special license that will allow fixtures to be fulfilled, staff to be paid and existing ticket holders to attend matches while, crucially, depriving Abramovich of benefiting from his ownership of the club.

""I know this brings some uncertainty, but the Government will work with the league & clubs to keep football being played while ensuring sanctions hit those intended. Football clubs are cultural assets and the bedrock of our communities. We're committed to protecting them.""

As well as Chelsea's sale being put on hold, the way the club operates on a day-to-day basis will be significantly impacted by the sanctions imposed on Abramovich.

Ticket sales halted and club shop closed

Ticket sales are no longer permitted, so only fans who have already purchased tickets will be able to attend matches at Stamford Bridge.

The club shop has also been closed as the sale of merchandise is no longer allowed.

Transfer ban

Chelsea can not buy or sell any players until further notice.

New contracts can not be issued either, which could make it very hard for Chelsea to keep hold of Andreas Christensen, Antonio Rudiger and Cesar Azpilicueta, with the trio's current deals set to expire on June 30.

Away travel

The license given to Chelsea to allow the club to continue operating runs until May 31.

Under the terms of the license, the club is prohibited from spending more than £20,000 on travel per away game.

Special licence means club can play fixtures, pay staff and have existing ticket holders at games

Team’s shirt sponsor Three also suspends deal with club

Roman Abramovich has been sanctioned by the UK government, freezing the Russian-Israeli billionaire’s planned sale of English soccer giants Chelsea.

Abramovich has owned the Premier League club since 2003 but put the club up for sale on 2nd March in the wake of Russia’s continued invasion of Ukraine.

A host of parties have signalled interest in buying Chelsea and the UK government has now confirmed that it could still oversee a sale.

Prime minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman said: “We are now talking to Chelsea Football Club and those conversations will continue. It would be part of those discussions the terms of any specific licence that’s granted to allow any sale to proceed.

“The important thing is under no circumstances would any sale allow Roman Abramovich to profit from that or take any money from that sale.

“It’s fair to say the government is open to the sale of the club but currently it would require another licence and that would require further conversation with the Treasury and other departments.”

Chelsea will be subject to a transfer ban and be blocked from negotiating new contracts with current players, after all of Abramovich’s UK assets were frozen.

Culture secretary Nadine Dorries said on Twitter: ‘Our priority is to hold those who have enabled the Putin regime to account.

‘Today’s sanctions obviously have a direct impact on Chelsea and its fans. We have been working hard to ensure the club & the national game are not unnecessarily harmed by these important sanctions.

‘To ensure the club can continue to compete and operate we are issuing a special licence that will allow fixtures to be fulfilled, staff to be paid and existing ticket holders to attend matches while, crucially, depriving Abramovich of benefiting from his ownership of the club.

‘I know this brings some uncertainty, but the government will work with the league and clubs to keep football being played while ensuring sanctions hit those intended. Football clubs are cultural assets and the bedrock of our communities. We’re committed to protecting them.’

Abramovich has changed the face of British soccer in his time as Chelsea owner, leading the Blues to 21 trophies in 19 years in a clean sweep of all global competitions.

But that era has been brought to a halt amid Vladimir Putin and Russia’s war in Ukraine.

Chelsea cannot sell any new tickets to supporters, but all tickets sold before 10th March will be honoured.

Season ticket holders can still attend matches unaffected, while refreshments can still be served at Stamford Bridge.

The sanctions are club-wide meaning all Chelsea teams, including Emma Hayes’ highly-successful women’s team, are affected.

Chelsea matches can still be broadcast, while only existing club merchandise can be sold. There are also limits on the amount that can be spent on travel by any team representing Chelsea – UK£20,000 (US$26,000) – and on costs for staging home matches – UK£500,000 (US$655,000).

The travel budget limit had brought into question the club’s ability to fulfil away ties in Europe for the rest of the season, but the PA news agency understands there is a degree of flexibility on the limits set out in the licence, particularly around European fixtures.

The Blues said in a statement they were seeking permission for the licence to be amended ‘in order to allow the club to operate as normal as possible’.

British billionaire Nick Candy was the latest high-profile business magnate to throw their hat into the ring for Chelsea’s sale, amid a host of suitors for the Uefa Champions League holders.

Swiss tycoon Hansjorg Wyss and American investor Todd Boehly were also in the running, with more than ten credible parties understood to have been compiling bids.

Chelsea’s shirt sponsor, telecommunications company Three, has also suspended its deal with the club.

This includes the removal of the brand logo from shirts and around Stamford Bridge until further notice.

A company spokesperson said: “We recognise that this decision will impact the many Chelsea fans who follow their team passionately. However, we feel that given the circumstances, and the government sanction that is in place, it is the right thing to do.”

Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich has been sanctioned.

In a document released by the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation, it reveals the Russian is “associated with a person who is or has been involved in destabilising Ukraine and undermining and threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, namely Vladimir Putin, with whom Abramovich has had a close relationship for decades.”

Last week, he announced his intention to sell Chelsea Football Club who he had owned for almost 20 years.

But now, his assets – including Chelsea – have been frozen and the sale won’t be able to take place.

Chelsea have been given a special licence to continue with football-related activities but the sale of the club is now impossible.

That’s unless Abramovich allows the UK government to take control of the process and he recieves nothing from the sale.

In addition, the club won’t be allowed to sell any more tickets and only season ticket holders can go to matches. They also won’t be able to sell any merchandise, sign any new players, offer any current players new contracts or sell any players.

In addition, ‘Russia regulations’ prohibits Chelsea from spending more than £20,000 on any away game – which means their away trip to Lille next week becomes extremely problematic.

The players and staff will still be paid.

The British government has officially added Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich to the list of sanctioned individuals.

Chelsea have been given a sporting licence to continue trading whilst Abramovich's assets have been frozen, but the Stamford Bridge club has been thrown into chaos with their sale in serious doubt.

Abramovich, who purchased Chelsea back in 2003, announced he was looking to sell in a statement on March 2 in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Various interested parties have since come forward with up to 10 serious buyers putting themselves in the mix.

However, the measures put in place now block a sale unless a fresh licence is used by the Treasury, something the government is open to, provided certain criteria are met.

The club are also set to be impacted in numerous ways, including being unable to sell tickets with only season ticket holders able to attend games.

The club have been placed under a special license with strict rules, which runs until May 31 and which the government can vary, revoke or suspend at any time.

They are able to pay players and staff as well as outstanding transfer fees, but any payments received will be frozen.

They can spend a maximum of £500k on staging games and only £20k on away game travel, although there will be flexibility on that cap for Champions League games.

The potential sale of Chelsea has been thrown into uncertainty, as owner Roman Abramovich has been sanctioned by the UK government and his assets, including Chelsea Football Club, have been frozen.

[ MORE: How to watch Premier League in USA ]

Chelsea have been given a special license (which runs out on May 31, 2022) to continue to operate as a club but they will not be able to buy and sell players, hand out new contracts to current players and benefit financially through merchandise, new ticket sales and many other avenues.

The UK government may ‘vary, revoke or suspend’ this license at any time, so there is the potential for the license to change in order for Chelsea to be sold but it appears the UK government will take over that process.

As of right now, the sale of the club is on hold as Abramovich was said to be close to selling Chelsea in the coming days for a reported fee of over $3 billion, as he previously said net profits would be donated to victims of the war in Ukraine.

A report from the Daily Telegraph says that Chelsea can still be sold, but only if no proceeds from the sale go to Roman Abramovich.

The UK government released a list of sanctions against Roman Abramovich, and others, for his close association with Russian president Vladimir Putin. The UK state that “Roman Abramovich is a prominent Russian businessman and pro-Kremlin oligarch” and that he has “had a close relationship with Vladimir Putin for decades.”

Our partners in the UK at Sky Sports understand that Chelsea and UK government officials will meet on Thursday, and Chelsea’s released a statement saying they will seek to be allowed to “operate as normal as possible.”

What has the UK government said?

Here is the statement from the UK government specifically on how this will impact Chelsea.

“Given the significant impact that today’s sanctions would have on Chelsea football club and the potential knock on effects of this, the Government has this morning published a license which authorises a number of football-related activities to continue at Chelsea. This includes permissions for the club to continue playing matches and other football related activity which will in turn protect the Premier League, the wider football pyramid, loyal fans and other clubs.

“This license will only allow certain explicitly named actions to ensure the designated individual is not able to circumvent UK sanctions. The licence will be kept under constant review and we will work closely with the football authorities.”

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson added the following statement on the sanctions against Abramovich and other individuals.

“There can be no safe havens for those who have supported Putin’s vicious assault on Ukraine,” Johnson said. “Today’s sanctions are the latest step in the UK’s unwavering support for the Ukrainian people. We will be ruthless in pursuing those who enable the killing of civilians, destruction of hospitals and illegal occupation of sovereign allies.”

How will this impact Chelsea?

Under the special license issued for Chelsea to continue to operate, here are the main talking points, with more clarification to come:

Only season ticket holders can go to games at Stamford Bridge

Chelsea can’t sell tickets for away games

No player transfers allowed

No new contracts for current players allowed

No merchandise sales allowed

Only $26,300 can be spent on travel costs for any Chelsea team travelling for a game

Costs limited to hosting games at Stamford Bridge to $657,000 to cover security, catering and stewarding

What has Chelsea said?

The European champions released this press release shortly after the sanctions were announced by the UK Goverment. Chelsea Football Club has been advised that its owner Roman Abramovich has been sanctioned by the UK Government.

By virtue of his 100 per cent ownership of Chelsea FC plc and affiliated entities, Chelsea FC would normally be subject to the same sanctions regime as Mr Abramovich. However, the UK Government has issued a general licence that permits Chelsea FC to continue certain activities. We will fulfil (sic) our men’s and women’s team fixtures today against Norwich and West Ham, respectively, and intend to engage in discussions with the UK Government regarding the scope of the licence. This will include seeking permission for the licence to be amended in order to allow the Club to operate as normal as possible. We will also be seeking guidance from the UK Government on the impact of these measures on the Chelsea Foundation and its important work in our communities. The Club will update further when it is appropriate to do so.

LONDON, March 10 (Reuters) - Britain's government halted a planned sale of soccer club Chelsea as well as the sale of players, new tickets and merchandise after it imposed sanctions on its owner, Roman Abramovich, but said the team will be able to play matches.

Abramovich said last week he was putting the club up for sale, but Britain's asset freeze and sanctions on him bar that process under the terms of the licence granted to the club.

The government said it had issued a special licence to allow Chelsea to play fixtures and pay staff, but it will limit the sale of tickets, merchandise and even players effective from Thursday.

Nadine Dorries, Britain's minister for sport, said the government had issuedthe licence because it did not want to unnecessarily harm the reigning European and world soccer champions.

""I know this brings some uncertainty, but the government will work with the league and clubs to keep football being played while ensuring sanctions hit those intended,"" she said on Twitter. ""Football clubs are cultural assets and the bedrock of our communities. We're committed to protecting them.""

Chelsea season ticket holders and those who have already bought tickets may attend matches, and parties who purchased or produced club merchandise prior to Thursday can still sell it, the government said.

Broadcasters are allowed to broadcast any fixtures involving Chelsea under pre-existing arrangements, and can pay revenue to the club for broadcasting licensing related to those fixtures.

Payment arrangements for deals to loan or transfer players, agreed prior to the sanctions, can also take place.

The government said the licence, which came into effect on Thursday and expires on May 31, would be kept under review.

However, the new measures put in place by the UK government block any such sale from going ahead.

Chelsea have since been given a sporting licence to continue trading while Abramovich's assets have been frozen, but the restrictions still have huge implications on the London-based club.

The new license is designed to help Chelsea continue operating and competing in sport, but stops the club from selling any new tickets, as well as freezing all merchandise and barring any new contract negotiations.

With ticket sales stopped, only season ticket holders will be allowed to attend games that were yet to go on sale.

The sanctions of course throw Chelsea's long-term future into doubt, but government ministers insist that any damage caused to the club will be limited.

""This includes permissions for the club to continue playing matches and other football related activity which will in turn protect the Premier League, the wider football pyramid, loyal fans and other clubs.""

Following the announcement of the sanctions, the UK government also revealed that the license is ""under constant review"", and that communication with football authorities are ongoing.

Abramovich was one of eight individuals named on the sanction list, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson says is designed to punish ""those who have supported Putin's vicious assault on Ukraine.""

With fans likely to be affected through the stopping of ticket sales, the Chelsea Supporters Trust have called for fans to be fully included in discussions over the licensing and sanctions going forward.

They took to Twitter to release a statement: ""The CST notes with concern the Government's statement regarding the owner,"" the group said in a post on its official Twitter page.

""Supporters must be involved in any conversation regarding ongoing impacts on the club and its global fan base.

""The CST implores the Government to conduct a swift process to minimise the uncertainty over Chelsea's future, for supporters and for supporters to be given a golden share as part of a sale of the club.""

Chelsea sale can go ahead as long as Abramovich doesn't profit

Johnson released a further statement on the sanctions of Russia, and insists the UK government are ""open"" to the sale of Chelsea, provided that Russian owner Abramovich doesn't profit.

A host of parties have already shown interest in potentially buying the club, with MMA star Conor McGregor teasing of a bid through social media.

Boris Johnson's spokesperson said: ""We are now talking to Chelsea Football Club and those conversations will continue. It would be part of those discussions the terms of any specific licence that's granted to allow any sale to proceed.

""It's fair to say the Government is open to the sale of the club but currently it would require another licence and that would require further conversation with the Treasury and other departments.""

As mentioned by the Prime Minister, if the club's sale is allowed, then The Treasury would have to grant a new license for the club, barring Abramovich from claiming any profit.

Tuchel remains happy at club

Thomas Tuchel insists he is happy to remain the Chelsea manager but admitted the 'situation will not go away'.

On the pitch, however, a 3-1 win was secured at Norwich by the men while the women's side beat West Ham by a 4-1 score on Thursday night.

""The situation will not go away, maybe tomorrow it will change again but it will not go away,"" Tuchel said.

""I am still happy to be here and still happy to be manager of a strong team. I know there is a lot of noise around.

""I don't have another answer for you. Relief would mean we struggle with all the information and news out there. It is a big change from yesterday to today. At the moment it seems on the football side it is almost protected.

The punitive measures mean only season ticket holders will be able to go to Chelsea games going forward or people who purchased tickets before 10 March.

Mr Abramovich is one of seven oligarchs targeted by Government in its latest round of UK sanctions.

The Government document detailing the updated list said Russian oligarch Mr Abramovich has had a “close relationship for decades” with the Russian president.

It also suggested Mr Abramovich had been involved in “potentially providing steel to the Russian military” which may have been used to produce tanks.

“Abramovich is or has been involved in destabilising Ukraine and undermining and threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, via Evraz PLC, a steel manufacturing and mining company in which Abramovich has a significant shareholding and over which Abramovich exercises effective control,” it said.

“Evraz PLC is or has been involved in providing financial services, or making available funds, economic resources, goods or technology that could contribute to destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine – which includes potentially supplying steel to the Russian military which may have been used in the production of tanks.”

Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries acknowledged the decision would have an impact on Chelsea Football Club, but said a special licence would enable it to continue operating.

“We have been working hard to ensure the club and the national game are not unnecessarily harmed by these important sanctions,” she said.

This includes permissions for the club to continue playing matches and other football related activity which will in turn protect the Premier League, the wider football pyramid, loyal fans and other clubs, the Government said.

The licence will be kept under constant review and the Government will work closely with the football authorities.

What does it mean for Chelsea? Chelsea FC has been seized by the Government as it is one of Mr Abramovich’s assets. The sale of the club is now on hold. Only season ticket holders will be able to go to Chelsea games going forward or people who purchased tickets before 10 March. The club is also no longer able to sell merchandise, buy players or offer new contracts. The Government has sought to reassure the club it would not be “unnecessarily harmed” by the move. Chelsea FC has been granted a special licence to allow it to continue operations. The club will be able to continue to play matches and other football related activity.

Ms Dorries added: “I know this brings some uncertainty, but the government will work with the league and clubs to keep football being played while ensuring sanctions hit those intended. Football clubs are cultural assets and the bedrock of our communities. We’re committed to protecting them.”

Mr Abramovich has long denied his associated with President Putin.

Last month the Chelsea owner’s spokesperson said he was attempting to help bring an end to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

“I can confirm that Roman Abramovich was contacted by the Ukrainian side for support in achieving a peaceful resolution, and that he has been trying to help ever since,” Mr Abramovich’s spokesperson told the PA news agency.

The Government is “open” to a sale of Chelsea FC if a licence is approved by the Treasury but Roman Abramovich must not be allowed to profit, Downing Street said.

A spokesman for Boris Johnson said: “We are now talking to Chelsea Football Club and those conversations will continue, it would be part of those discussions the terms of any specific licence that’s granted to allow any sale to proceed.

“The important thing is under no circumstances would any sale allow Roman Abramovich to profit from that or take any money from that sale.”

The spokesman added: “It’s fair to say the Government is open to the sale of the club but currently it would require another licence, and that would require further conversation with the Treasury and other departments.”

Six other individuals have been targeted by the new wave of sanctions – who have a collective net worth of around £15bn – and will have their assets frozen by the UK Government.

They will also be prohibited from making transactions with UK individuals and businesses, be subject to a travel ban and also have transport sanctions imposed.

Other individuals targeted include President Putin’s right-hand man Igor Sechin and four more of the Russian leader’s inner circle.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “There can be no safe havens for those who have supported Putin’s vicious assault on Ukraine.

“Today’s sanctions are the latest step in the UK’s unwavering support for the Ukrainian people. We will be ruthless in pursuing those who enable the killing of civilians, destruction of hospitals and illegal occupation of sovereign allies.”

Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss aid Mr Abramovich and the other Russian oligarchs sanctioned are “complicit” in Putin’s aggression.

“The blood of the Ukrainian people is on their hands. They should hang their heads in shame,” she said.

“Our support for Ukraine will not waver. We will not stop in this mission to ramp up the pressure on the Putin regime and choke off funds to his brutal war machine.”",https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/roman-abramovich-sanctions-chelsea-owner-assets-frozen-russian-oligarch-sanctioned-uk-1508757
