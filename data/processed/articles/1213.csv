A spokesman for the nuclear plant, Andriy Tuz, was quoted by The Associated Press as telling Ukrainian television that shells had set fire to one of the plant’s six reactors that was under renovation and not operating.

Ukraine’s nuclear inspectorate later said in its statement that one unit of the six units was operating, another was in “outage,” two were being cooled down, and two others had been disconnected from the grid.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine had accused the Russian military of deliberately attacking the complex and said an explosion there would have been “the end for everybody, the end of Europe.”

“Only immediate actions by Europe could stop the Russian army,” he added.

President Biden spoke with Mr. Zelensky about the fire and joined him in urging Russia to “cease its military activities in the area and allow firefighters and emergency responders to access the site,” the White House said. Local reports later said that emergency crews had gained access.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/03/world/europe/nuclear-plant-fire-zaporizhzhia-video.html

The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on Friday in response to Russia’s attack and capture of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, which caused worldwide alarm about the potential for a nuclear accident if the conflict in Ukraine is not contained.

The United States and its allies denounced Russia for the attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine, calling it a threat to civilians and a reckless escalation. They condemned the seizure of the plant and called for Russia to withdraw its troops from Zaporizhzhia and from the former Chernobyl nuclear plant in northern Ukraine.

“By the grace of God, the world narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe last night,” said Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. “Mr. Putin must stop this madness, and he must stop it now. Cooler heads must prevail.”

Early on Friday, as fighting reached the vicinity of the Zaporizhzhia plant, a fire started at a training building. The fire was extinguished, and the plant appeared to be safe on Friday. Ukrainian officials and the International Atomic Energy Agency said the fire had been contained without damage to the reactors or other equipment, and that radiation levels had not increased.

“This is the first time that a state has attacked a fueled and functioning nuclear power plant,” said Britain’s U.N. ambassador, Barbara Woodward, who had called for the Security Council meeting. “It must not happen again.”

Russia’s ambassador, Vasily Nebenzya, told the council that the allegations that Russia had attacked the nuclear site were “lies” and part of an anti-Russian campaign. He said the emergency meeting had been called to “kindle artificial hysteria about what is taking place in Ukraine.”

Mr. Nebenzya offered a different account of the incident, saying that Russian troops patrolling the area of the nuclear facility had come under fire from Ukrainian forces inside the training building and had returned fire. He accused Ukrainians of setting the blaze.

“Our servicemen are not interfering with the work of the operators of the power plants and only working to ensure stability,” Mr. Nebenzya said, adding that Russia had experienced the 1986 Chernobyl disaster and did not want to see another nuclear accident.

The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, briefed the council from an airplane en route to Iran. Mr. Grossi said he had proposed to the Ukrainian and Russian authorities that he travel to Ukraine as soon as possible and visit both nuclear sites, Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia, to establish a framework to protect them.

Mr. Grossi said his mission would not be political and would be restricted to ensuring “the safety and security of nuclear establishments of Ukraine, which, as facts have shown, are in constant danger of accidents.” He added that the Zaporizhzhia facility was operating normally, but said he had informed the I.A.E.A. board of governors that “there is no normalcy to the situation when there are military forces in charge of the site.”

Beyond the statements of diplomats, the Security Council cannot take significant action against Russia because the country has veto power over legally binding resolutions. Russia vetoed a resolution last week that condemned its invasion of Ukraine and called for the immediate withdrawal of its troops.

The U.N. General Assembly, a 193-member body, passed a resolution on Wednesday that condemned the invasion and called for humanitarian access and a diplomatic solution. That resolution, which was politically symbolic but not legally binding, passed with 141 countries voting in favor, demonstrating Russia’s isolation on the world stage, diplomats said.

Russia voted against the measure, joined by Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea and Syria.",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/03/04/world/russia-ukraine

Dmytro Orlov, mayor of nearby Enerhodar, wrote on Facebook: ""A threat to world security!!! As a result of relentless shelling by the enemy of the buildings and blocks of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is on fire!!!""

Fire fighters were dispatched to control the blaze but Russian troops continued to target the area. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called on Russia to “immediately cease the fire, allow firefighters, establish a security zone.""

Kuleba continued by warning that the fire could be ten times worse than Chernobyl, the 1986 explosion at a nuclear power plant in northern Ukraine which is the most catastrophic nuclear disaster in human history.

However the head of the military administration in the Zaporizhzhia region has since confirmed: ""The director of the plant said that the nuclear safety is now guaranteed.”

What is the situation in Zaporizhzhia?

Within the past hour there have been various reports from local sources describing the situation in the area and the continued attack of Russia troops. Orlov decried the “continuous enemy shelling of buildings and units of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe.”

In a short video message he urged Russia to halt the firing to allow emergency response teams to secure the area. However Russian troops appeared to make a concerted effort to target the nuclear plant and it seems unlikely that they would choose to allow Ukraine to make the area safe.

While the situation is incredibly serious, initial reports suggest that the fire will be much less dangerous that the Chernobyl disaster. The plant includes six nuclear power units, only one of which was operating. The third power unit is the one most likely to be affected by the shooting and it was disconnected from the unified energy system, at the time.

In a Telegram post in response to the fire, Ukrainian State Emergency Service reported: “Radiation and fire safety conditions at nuclear power plants are within normal limits. Fire condition at the NPP is normal.”

Experts generally agree that the risk to human life in such a situation is incredibly nuanced and based on a number of factors. Mariana Budjeryn is a Ukrainian expert on nuclear energy at Harvard University’s Belfer Center and has spoken to The Guardian about the Zaporizhzhia power plant.

“Saying that a reactor building is hit doesn’t tell us much, because the most vulnerable [part of] this is the electricity and water supply,” she said.

“If the core explodes, there’s hope that the confinement chamber will capture the radiation from release into the environment. Confinement chambers are designed with withstand some level of impact, even bombing.”

For now it appears that a major crisis has been averted but the continued Russian bombardment of nuclear sites makes the prospect of catastrophe increasingly likely.",https://en.as.com/en/2022/03/04/latest_news/1646362160_349165.html

""Operational personnel are monitoring the condition of power units,"" a local authority said on social media, adding that the efforts sought to ensure the operations were in line with safety requirements.

Earlier, local emergency services managed to extinguish the fire at the after it was shelled by Russian forces.

The Ukranian State Emergency Service wrote on their social media accounts that the fire was now out and there were no injuries.

According to Ukrainian emergency officials, the fighting sparked fires on the third, fourth and fifth floor of a building at the nuclear complex.

In a video posted on Twitter, Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russians of deliberately shooting at the Zaporizhzhia plant's six reactors using tanks equipped with thermal imaging.

Invoking the ""global catastrophe"" at Chernobyl in 1986, he warned the consequences of a meltdown at Zaporizhzhia would be far worse.

""Europeans, wake up please. Tell your politicians that Russian forces are shooting at the nuclear plant in Ukraine,"" he begged.

The flight, which will reach Moldova via Romania, will also transport a 40-strong team of medical personnel who will join a group of volunteers the organization sent earlier this week to work at three field hospitals the rescue organization is setting up at Moldova’s Ukraine border for people fleeing Russia’s invasion.

The team is made up of EMTs, paramedics and doctors, as well as members of the organization’s Psychotrauma and Crisis Response Unit, which provides aid in the field for people who are undergoing trauma. Many of medics expect to be deployed for around two weeks, but the fast-moving crisis means that many could be away from home for longer.

Much of the aid on the plane is medical equipment for the field hospitals, but there is also food, warm clothing, blankets, heat pads, diapers, formula and feminine hygiene products – many of the supplies have been donated by a number of Israeli companies.

In a move that distinguishes the team from other aid organizations, they are also transporting two Torah scrolls for religious members of their teams on the ground.

The plane will return to Israel later in the day carrying some 150 refugees with Israeli citizenship back to Israel.

“The complexity of this operation is immense. It involves travel permits, diplomatic relations, and travel between three countries by land and by air,” says Eli Beer, president of United Hatzalah.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the international body’s refugee agency, said Wednesday that over 1 million people are now refugees as a result of the fighting in Ukraine, with concerns that figure will keep climbing. There were 44 million Ukrainians on the eve of the invasion.

Refugees are crossing the borders from Ukraine into neighboring countries to the west — Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary and Moldova.

The airlift is the latest in a number of deliveries sent from Israel this week to Ukraine and its neighboring countries to deal with the growing humanitarian crisis there.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-march-3-2022/
