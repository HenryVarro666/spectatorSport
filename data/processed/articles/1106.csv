Russia has begun to mobilize military reinforcements to send into Ukraine as its combat losses continue to grow, the Pentagon said Friday, citing its latest intelligence assessments. “We now have indications that they are drawing on forces from Georgia,” said a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Biden administration. “Russian troops that are based in Georgia. We don’t have an exact number.”

Thousands of Russian troops are stationed at military outposts from Georgia to Syria to Tajikistan, many of them assigned to motorized rifle brigades that experts consider combat-capable and ready to deploy immediately.

Those forces have become the centerpiece of what the Pentagon believes is the Kremlin’s plan to keep its ground offensive going, as Russian commanders in Ukraine sustain heavy casualties. According to the Pentagon, Russia now has between 85 and 90 percent of its “combat power” remaining after meeting a ferocious resistance in and around cities throughout the country. The invading force numbered about 150,000 personnel.

NATO officials estimated earlier this week that as many as 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in the war, which began four weeks ago. Russia has offered a far lower figure, reporting Friday that only 1,351 of its servicemen had died in the fighting.

While reinforcements may bring Russian forces in Ukraine some temporary relief, they are unlikely to change the war’s course, according to military experts who focus on the region. They note that Russia cannot redeploy foreign-based troops in significant numbers without creating vulnerabilities in other hot spots, as its military probably does not have enough skilled personnel in the pipeline to keep those stations adequately manned and fuel an influx capable of overwhelming local resistance.

“I’m not sure that anything that the Russian military will do will change the balance; it’s more about patching up gaps,” said Dmitry Gorenburg, a Russian military expert with CNA, a Washington think tank. “They’re going to be brought in as fresh bodies, primarily, to replenish the losses. … Folks who are suggesting they’re bringing in everybody they can for one big push to break Ukrainian resistance, I don’t see that as possible now.”

The Russian military has several contingents stationed abroad, but those considered most ripe for tapping reinforcements are located in Georgia’s separatist republics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and in Armenia, Syria and Tajikistan.

Tajikistan, which hosts a Russian division outside of its capital, Dushanbe, is the largest outpost, and chiefly occupied with monitoring and managing threats emanating from Afghanistan.

There are a few thousand Russian forces based in each of the Georgian breakaway republics, which have depended on Russian patronage since the 2008 Russo-Georgian war. A similar number are based in Armenia, where Russia’s footprint has grown since Moscow began deploying peacekeepers to manage the aftermath of the recent war in Nagorno Karabakh.

It is unclear how many Russian troops are operating in Syria, where they joined the civil war in 2015 on the side of President Bashar al-Assad’s army.

Troops stationed in these countries are predominantly contract soldiers — members of Russia’s professional volunteer force — not the lesser-trained conscripts who compose more than a quarter of Russia’s total military force. That gives them some potential advantages, experts note.

“If they are substituting the contract soldiers for the conscripts, who have been drafted and aren’t happy and aren’t as well trained, then that could be helpful. They’re probably better trained as well, and their morale will certainly be higher than the conscripts that came in thinking they were going to liberate the Donbas and instead found themselves mired around Kyiv,” said Jim Townsend, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Europe and NATO during the Obama administration.

Townsend was referring to violent clashes within the separatist region in eastern Ukraine, where Russian forces have begun to concentrate their efforts, and around the capital, where stiff resistance has compelled advancing units to form defensive positions.

“But just because they’re new doesn’t mean they’re better and just because they’re new doesn’t mean they’re the kinds of troops that are needed for the battlefield in Ukraine,” he added. “If they bring in infantry when they need to bring in logisticians, that’s not going to help.”

Russia’s foreign garrisons do not boast particularly elite personnel, experts say, and its efforts to modernize such outposts, they add, have lagged behind other parts of the force.

“These units aren’t really that unique and, for the most part, they are not as well equipped as some of the best Russian units; only last year did they start to reequip the ones in Tajikistan,” said Rob Lee, a Russian military expert with the Foreign Policy Research Institute. But, he noted, Moscow is not in much of a position to be picky, given that it has already committed a majority of its battalion tactical groups to its operations in Ukraine.

“You’re talking up to a third or more of the actual combat troops deployed to Ukraine are casualties, which is an insane number,” Lee continued. “It’s not surprising that if they have to pull from anywhere, it’s going to include these other bases … it’s another indication that they’re just having issues with their manpower.”

But diverting personnel to Ukraine could create some risk for Russia in the areas they are drawn from, some experts say. In Georgia, for instance, there have been selective calls among the citizenry to take advantage of Russia’s preoccupation in Ukraine by trying to reclaim South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Though the likelihood such an operation would be successful is considered remote, it is reason for Moscow to be wary of how far it draws down its forces there.

Around Armenia, there is danger of a regional flare-up should Russia pull away too many troops, especially those who have been deployed as a peacekeeping force in Nagorno Karabakh, an Armenian-populated enclave that declared a contested independence from Azerbaijan during the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and was the site of a bloody war in 2020, as Azerbaijan reclaimed parts of the territory. Tensions with Azerbaijan have spiked again in recent weeks, sparking new concerns war could resume.

Some reports from the region also suggest that Armenia and Turkey are inching closer to normalized relations — a shift that Russia may see as reason to sustain its geopolitical “levers” in the region, Gorenburg pointed out.

In Syria, meanwhile, pervasive instability poses a potential complication to drawing on forces to backfill losses in Ukraine. Syria has been an important foothold for Russian force projection in the Middle East, and Moscow has maintained a contingent of forces and continued to invest resources there, even after the worst of the civil war died down. That trend appears to be continuing, despite the intensity of hostilities in Ukraine: Russia’s military positioned warplanes in Syria for naval drills earlier this year.

“The problem,” Lee said, “is they need troops there, they continue to patrol in northern Syria, and they also patrol in northeastern Syria’s border with Turkey. So they can’t pull too many guys away from there.”

In Tajikistan, the threat from Afghanistan is thought to be less critical now than they were during the height of the Taliban’s resurgence and the American evacuation. Russia has invested in its Tajik base more than most other outposts, sending new equipment in recent months and staging military drills there over the summer.

Beyond Georgia, the Pentagon has yet to assess with any certainty from where Russia may pull additional reinforcements — and when any such troops might start joining those in Ukraine. Russia is already drawing on paramilitary forces, including mercenary organizations like the Wagner Group, and Chechen fighters loyal to Ramzan Kadyrov, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and the region’s leader.

Boasts by Putin and his defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, that thousands of Middle Eastern “volunteers” would join the Russian invasion in Ukraine appear not to have come to fruition. On Friday, Russia’s Ministry of Defense claimed that 23,000 volunteers from 37 unidentified countries had expressed their willingness to fight but that separatist leaders in Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions refused the help. Earlier this month, only four countries — Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea and Syria — joined Russia in voting against a U.N. General Assembly condemnation of the Ukraine invasion, while 38 countries abstained.

That leaves Russian reinforcements stationed abroad as the Kremlin’s best and most likely option for shoring up its growing losses. But these will provide Putin with only a “short-to-medium-term solution,” experts say.

“It’s not a game changer. A game changer is coming in and wiping out the Ukraine air force. A game changer is coming in and using chemical warfare,” Townsend said. More troops, he added, are just “another card [Putin] can play before he turns to chemical weapons.”

Russia’s vast arsenal of chemical, biological and tactical nuclear weapons has fueled speculation about what Putin may do if he feels he is running out of options in Ukraine. But the fact he appears close to moving more troops into Ukraine may be a sign that the Russian leader plans to hold his most drastic potential moves in reserve.

“I think tactical nuclear weapons are actually somewhat unlikely because of this,” Gorenburg said. “It’s hard to use them in a way that doesn’t blow back onto their own people,” Gorenburg said.

It is increasingly ""likely"" that Belarus will enter the conflict, a NATO military official said on Monday. ""(Russian President Vladimir) Putin needs support. Anything would help,"" the official explained.

A Belarusian opposition source said that Belarusian combat units are ready to go into Ukraine as soon as in the next few days, with thousands of forces prepared to deploy.

Russia has launched its attack on Ukraine in part from Belarus' territory, and thousands of Russian troops amassed in Belarus ahead of the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine last month, which the two countries had claimed was for training exercises. US and European sanctions in response to the war have targeted both Russian and Belarusian officials, including Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.

Belarus moved to change its constitution last month to allow the country to host both Russian forces and nuclear weapons permanently, though US officials have emphasized to CNN that they have not yet seen any evidence of Russia moving nuclear weapons or preparing to.

The sources emphasized that there have been no indications to date that Belarus is currently participating in the fighting in Ukraine, and a senior US defense official said the Pentagon had not seen ""any indications that the Belarusians are preparing to move in -- into Ukraine or that they have made any agreements to do that.""

The NATO military official said that a final decision for Belarus' involvement in the war still has to be made in Moscow, as of yet there has been no indication that Belarusian forces are participating in the fighting in Ukraine.

""It is not about what Lukashenko wants,"" the official explained. ""The question is: does Putin want another unstable country in the region?""

""Involvement would destabilize Belarus,"" the official said.

Ukraine forces retake Kyiv suburb

Ukraine said it retook a strategically important suburb of Kyiv on Tuesday, as Russian forces squeezed other areas near the capital and pressed their attack on the embattled southern port of Mariupol.

Explosions and bursts of gunfire shook Kyiv, and black smoke rose from a spot in the north. Intensified artillery fire could be heard from the northwest, where Russia has sought to encircle and capture several suburban areas of the capital, a crucial target.

Residents sheltered at home or underground under a 35-hour curfew imposed by city authorities that runs to Wednesday morning.

Russian forces also continued their siege of Mariupol after the southern port city's defenders refused demands to surrender, with fleeing civilians describing relentless bombardments and corpses lying in the streets. But the Kremlin's ground offensive in other parts of the country advanced slowly or not at all, knocked back by lethal hit-and-run attacks by the Ukrainians.

Early Tuesday, Ukrainian troops drove Russian forces out of the Kyiv suburb of Makariv after a fierce battle, Ukraine's Defence Ministry said. The regained territory allowed Ukrainian forces to retake control of a key highway and block Russian troops from surrounding Kyiv from the northwest.

Still, the Defence Ministry said Russian forces were able to partially take other northwest suburbs, Bucha, Hostomel and Irpin, some of which had been under attack almost since Russia's military invaded almost a month ago.

Russia's invasion has driven more than 10 million people from their homes, almost a quarter of Ukraine's pre-war population, according to the United Nations. The UN has confirmed 953 civilian deaths while saying the real toll is probably much higher.

Estimates of Russian military casualties in the grinding war have been hard to come by and vary, but even conservative figures by Western officials are in the low thousands. Russia has not given an update since it said March 2 that 498 soldiers had been killed in action in Ukraine. Russia's pro-Kremlin Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper, citing the Defence Ministry, briefly reported Monday that almost 10,000 Russian soldiers had been killed. The report was quickly removed, and newspaper blamed hackers. The Kremlin refused to comment on Tuesday.

Beyond the terrible human toll, the war has shaken the post-Cold War global security consensus, imperilled the global supply of key crops including wheat, and repeatedly raised worries it could set off a nuclear accident. Ukraine's natural resources minister said wildfires near the Chernobyl nuclear power plant have been extinguished and radiation levels in the area are within norms. Fires are not uncommon in the area, but raise concern about the potential release of radiation from fallout from the 1986 explosion and fire at the plant.

Concerns have been expressed for safety at the decommissioned plant since it was seized by Russian forces last month. The power supply was temporarily cut amid fighting earlier this month, and Ukraine's nuclear regulatory agency said Monday that radiation monitors around the plant had stopped working.

Facing unexpectedly stiff resistance, Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces are increasingly concentrating their air power and artillery on Ukraine's cities and the civilians living there. A senior US defence official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the military's assessment, said Russia had increased its air sorties, carrying out as many as 300 over a 24-hour period.

US and British officials say Kyiv remains Russia's primary objective. The bulk of Moscow's forces remain miles from the centre, but missiles and artillery have destroyed apartment buildings and a large shopping mall, which was left a smoking ruin after being hit late Sunday by strikes that killed eight people, according to emergency officials.

US President Joe Biden, who is heading to Europe later in the week to meet with allies, suggested Monday evening that worse may be still to come.

""Putin's back is against the wall,"" Biden said. ""He wasn't anticipating the extent or the strength of our unity. And the more his back is against the wall, the greater the severity of the tactics he may employ.""

Biden reiterated accusations that Putin is considering resorting to using chemical or biological weapons, though Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Tuesday that the United States has seen no evidence to suggest that use of such weapons was ""imminent.""

Talks to end the fighting have continued by video but failed to bridge the chasm between the two sides. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told Ukrainian television late Monday that he would be prepared to consider waiving any bid by Ukraine to join NATO — a key Russian demand — in exchange for a cease-fire, the withdrawal of Russian troops and a guarantee of Ukraine's security.

Zelenskyy also suggested Kyiv would be open to future discussions on the status of Crimea, which Russia seized in 2014, and areas of the eastern Donbas region held by Russian-backed separatists. But he said that was a topic for another time.

As part of a series of addresses to foreign legislatures to drum up support for Ukraine, Zelenskyy spoke to Italian lawmakers on Tuesday, telling them that the besieged port of Mariupol had been utterly destroyed in the Russian onslaught. He also spoke to Pope Francis.

""Imagine a Genoa completely burned down,"" he said to rapt lawmakers, citing an Italian port city of a similar size. Mariupol officials said on March 15 that at least 2300 people had died in the siege, and they have not given an update since. Zelenskyy said 117 children had been killed in the war so far.

Some people managed to flee Mariupol, where weeks of Russian bombardment has cut off electricity, water and food supplies and severed communication with the outside world. The city council said Tuesday that more than 1100 people who had escaped the besieged city were on their way in a convoy of buses to another city to Mariupol's northwest.

But the Red Cross said a humanitarian aid convoy trying to reach the embattled city with desperately needed supplies still had not been able to enter.

Perched on the Sea of Azov, Mariupol is a crucial port for Ukraine and lies along a stretch of territory between Russia and Crimea. The siege of Mariupol has cut the city off from the sea and allowed Russia to establish a land corridor to Crimea.

But it's not clear how much of the city it holds, with fleeing residents saying fighting continues street by street. Ukraine's Defence Ministry said Tuesday that their forces were still defending the city and had destroyed a Russian patrol boat and electronic warfare complex. Britain's Defence Ministry said its intelligence showed that ""Ukrainian forces continue to repulse Russian attempts to occupy"" the city.

Those who have made it out of Mariupol told of a devastated city.

""Mariupol is almost 99 per cent destroyed,"" said 39-year-old Viktoria Totsen, who managed to escape the city and cross into Poland. ""They bombed us for the past 20 days. During the last five days the planes were flying over us every five seconds and dropped bombs everywhere — on residential buildings, kindergartens, art schools, everywhere.""

In all, more than 8000 people escaped to safer areas Monday through humanitarian corridors, including about 3000 from Mariupol, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said.

Inside a city administration building, two Ukrainian generals helping to lead the counterattack pored over a map detailing the movement of their country's forces and the areas they had apparently recaptured. This is where officials from the city’s police, military and local government are meeting, planning and monitoring the war.

Gen. Andrea Kryshenko and Gen. Serhii Knyazev said Wednesday that Ukraine regained significant territory around Kyiv in the past two days — a potential sign that the war, which enters the second month, could undergo a shift as Russian forces struggle to advance on the country's capital.

A U.S. defense official corroborated the claim, saying that the Russian military had pushed from the east to as close as 12 miles from Kyiv. After the counteroffensive, those forces had retreated to about 34 miles away from the city, the official added.

But some military experts have cautioned that it's hard to tell whether the gains Ukraine claims to have made in the past 48 hours are real. Even if they are, they say, the coming days will be incredibly important as Putin could deploy even more lethal weapons in his bid to break Kyiv's defenses and as Ukraine struggles to hold the southern port city of Mariupol.

Knyazev, the former head of Ukraine’s National Police and now a military and police adviser, said that the city's defenders have used local waterways, ridges and geographic features to help push back the Russian forces.

""The head commander of Ukrainian ground forces manages the Kyiv defenses,"" he said, ""and the tactical moves that they deployed allowed us to take back the settlements that are important for further counteroffensive actions.""

It marks a notable, though fragile, potential breakthrough around which Ukrainians are rallying.

The country's defense ministry said Tuesday that it had taken back Makariv, a town roughly 40 miles west of Kyiv on a key highway. And the Bucha City Council said in a Facebook post that the Ukrainian military had surrounded its town, as well as the Kyiv suburbs of Irpin and Hostomel, cutting Russian forces off from supplies and support.

With few reporters on the front lines, it is difficult to verify these accounts. But government officials say recent days have brought the biggest counteroffensive since the start of the invasion — and they intend to continue the push.

Other counteroffensives had also appeared effective.

The Russian drive through Kyiv’s suburbs in the northwest was stymied, the defense official said, and its army there had started “digging in” and taking up defensive positions. An assault further north of Kyiv, in Chernihiv, had stalled, and the Russian forces had been unable to advance near Mykolaiv in the south.

""We need to liberate all of our territories, so of course we will push them back and destroy them,"" said Kryshenko, the former Kyiv chief of police who now serves as the deputy head of the Kyiv City Military Administration.

Current and former Ukrainian defense officials said that, at least for the moment, their efforts had helped solve multiple problems for the country's military.

Leonid Polyakov, Ukraine’s former vice minister of defense, explained over the phone from Kyiv that recapturing Marakiv would make it easier to deliver military aid and humanitarian supplies that flowed from the border to the country's capital, which has become a stronghold.

It would also ease pressure on the defenders of Kyiv in the northwest who have faced a difficult Russian offensive, he said, allowing them to address casualties and help trapped civilians.

If Ukraine had indeed surrounded Russian forces, Polyakov said, noting the claims needed further verification, that would allow its military to cut the attackers off from supply lines, discourage Belarus from joining Putin’s fight and would take a huge toll on the invaders’ morale.

“They will have just two options, either die or surrender,” Polyakov said of Russian forces who may be surrounded in areas near Kyiv. “We will continue killing them until they surrender.”

The reported recapture of Makariv is significant, said Steven Horrell, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis and a former U.S. naval intelligence officer.

""It is Ukraine truly counterattacking, taking back territory and, to a certain extent, pushing back what Russia had advanced in the very early stages of the war,"" he said.

""But it's only one of the several major battlefields across Ukraine,"" Horrell added.

A senior NATO official said this week that after nearly a month of fighting, the war in Ukraine was entering a stalemate, with Moscow making only marginal gains as its troops faced significant logistical challenges, including fuel and food shortages.

It is also unclear how strong Putin's army remains. A senior U.S. defense official told reporters Tuesday that Putin’s combat power is dropping, and NATO estimates that between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian troops have died so far — many multiples more than the number of Americans who died over 20 years in Afghanistan.

""The Russians have not achieved any of the strategic objectives that they set out to, and they certainly haven’t achieved the objectives that they have easily or without loss,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said earlier this week.

He would not confirm specific reports from Ukraine that it had recaptured suburbs of Kyiv.

Mark Cancian, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that while reports of Ukraine's counterattacks in the Kyiv suburbs were encouraging, it was important not to read too much into the events of the past 24 hours.

""The front lines are likely very fluid,"" he said. ""We will have to see whether they can expand on this and whether the Russians have to pull back from some of their other positions.""

There is also concern that there is not a complete picture of military movements within Ukraine, despite the images and information on social media that appear to come from the region.

Keir Giles, the research director of the Conflict Studies Research Centre in London, said that there's a growing paradox in Ukraine as the world receives a flood of data and video that is difficult to verify.

""What we don't have from all of these videos of burning Russian tanks is an overall holistic appreciation of what the actual situation is, because there's so little that we see that gives us an ability to judge the Ukrainian capacity for continuing to resist,"" he said. ""And that is going to be the defining factor when it comes to peace negotiations, because only the Ukrainians will know at what point they are either facing collapse or, conversely, actually getting stronger.""

Some experts and U.S. officials worry that the more difficulty Putin encounters in Ukraine, the more likely he is to turn to extreme measures, such as biological and chemical weapons.

Senators, such as Marco Rubio, R-Fla., also raised concerns that Putin could use a small-scale nuclear weapon in a targeted manner.

The rationale is that Putin could see it as a means to turn the tide, as the Russian military gets bogged down in a costly, drawn-out battle against Ukrainian fighters.

""The Russians seem to have stalemated,"" Cancian said. ""And as a result, I think they're moving into a third phase of the war, which is a bombardment phase.""

Also complicating Ukraine's military success around Kyiv is the possibility that Russia could soon take over the southern city of Mariupol. That could free up Russian forces to move to operations in other parts of country, threatening Ukraine's offensive and creating a connected, logistically supported Russian front in the southeast.

Experts previously told NBC News that Russian troops who have been stuck fighting in Mariupol could either push west to Odesa or north in an effort to threaten the rear of Ukrainian forces operating in the Donbas region if they successfully seize the city.

“What we’re seeing now are indications that the Russians are trying to prioritize that part of eastern Ukraine,” the defense official said.

Polyakov argued that the Ukrainians could maintain the fight in Mariupol for weeks and were more interested in securing and protecting the lives of civilians.

""They have big losses and have concentrated a lot of different sorts of troops there: Spetsnaz [Russian special forces], seasoned fighters from Donbas and others,"" he said. ""But we still have enough troops capable of damaging them.""

Britain sending thousands more missiles to Ukraine LONDON — Britain will send thousands more missiles to Ukraine’s government as Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged Western allies to boost the supply of military aid to Ukraine. Johnson is traveling to Brussels on Thursday for talks with NATO and leaders of the Group of Seven. He is expected to provide further details of the new British aid during the visit, including the donation of 6,000 more missiles comprising anti-tank and high-explosive weaponry. “The United Kingdom will work with our allies to step up military and economic support to Ukraine, strengthening their defenses as they turn the tide in this fight,” Johnson said. Britain has already sent more than 4,000 anti-tank weapons to Ukraine. The U.K. government also says it is providing some 4 million pounds ($5.3 million) in emergency funding to the BBC World Service to counter disinformation in Russia and Ukraine. Share this -







NATO secretary general: Russia must stop nuclear saber-rattling, nuclear war cannot be won NATO's secretary general on Wednesday called on Russia to ""stop its nuclear saber-rattling,"" calling the rhetoric dangerous and irresponsible and saying a nuclear war cannot be won. ""Any use of nuclear weapons will fundamentally change the nature of the conflict, and Russia must understand that a nuclear war should never been fought and they can never win a nuclear war,"" Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said at a news conference. Russian President Vladimir Putin said days after the invasion of Ukraine that he had ordered his nuclear deterrent forces to be on alert. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov refused in an interview with CNN on Tuesday to rule out the use of nuclear weapons, saying only that nuclear weapons could be used ""if it is an existential threat for our country."" Defense Department press secretary John Kirby said Tuesday that potential uses of nuclear weapons or changes in nuclear posture are dangerous. ""It's not the way a responsible nuclear power should act. So we've been very clear about that,"" he said. Share this -







Almost 1,000 civilian deaths recorded in Ukraine, but real numbers considerably higher, U.N. says The United Nations has recorded 977 civilians killed in Ukraine since Russia attacked almost a month ago, its human rights office said Wednesday — but it said the real figures are likely to be much higher. Of the dead, 81 were children. The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights has recorded 2,571 civilian casualties in all, which includes 1,594 injured. Those are numbers that have been recorded by the office, but it noted that reports of casualties in some areas — including besieged Mariupol — have been delayed by intense fighting and that other reports must be corroborated. The human rights office ""believes that the actual figures are considerably higher,"" it said in an update. Most of the recorded casualties are being caused by weapons that affect large areas, like artillery, rockets and airstrikes. The U.S. said it has assessed that members of Russia's armed forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Wednesday's announcement cited what he called credible reports of indiscriminate attacks and attacks deliberately targeting civilians. Blinken said officials in Mariupol said that more than 2,400 civilians had been killed in the city alone. The U.N. said that there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties in Mariupol, as well as several other cities, and that those figures are being further corroborated and are not included in its numbers.

Russia moves to expel U.S. diplomats and staff in latest tit-for-tat Russia declared some U.S. diplomats and staff ""persona non grata"" and moved to expel them from the country, in the latest in a back-and-forth between the two nations. A State Department spokesperson confirmed that the U.S. Embassy received a list of diplomats, and the spokesperson called on the Russian government to end its “unjustified expulsions” of U.S. diplomats and staff. The move is the latest in a series of tit-for-tats that has left both nuclear powers with a skeletal diplomatic presence at a high point of tension between Washington and Moscow over Russia’s war on Ukraine. “This is Russia’s latest unhelpful and unproductive step in our bilateral relationship,” the State Department spokesperson said. “Now more than ever, it is critical that our countries have the necessary diplomatic personnel in place to facilitate communication between our governments."" Russia on Wednesday said the deportation was in response to Washington’s expulsion of 11 Russian diplomats from their Mission to the UN in New York, as well as one Russian employee in the UN Secretariat. The U.S. said the Russians were intelligence operatives “who have abused their privileges of residency in the U.S. by engaging in espionage activities that are adverse to our national security.” Share this -







Ukrainian forces push back Russian forces near Kyiv, U.S. official says Russia intensifies attacks in Kyiv but is losing territory, according to Ukraine officials March 23, 2022 01:55 Ukrainian forces have pushed back Russian forces east of the capital of Kyiv by at least 15 miles and have stymied Russian forces to the northwest of the city, a U.S. defense official said Wednesday. Russian forces to the east of Kyiv are about 34 miles from the city after the counterattack, the senior defense official said. But east of Ukraine, in the Donbas area, Russian forces ""have applied a lot more energy, particularly around Luhansk,"" the official said. There are indications that Russian troops may be trying to prioritize that part of eastern Ukraine, the official said. Russia attacked and invaded Ukraine almost a month ago in what has been condemned as an unprovoked and unjustified attack. Since the invasion began, Russia has launched more than 1,200 missiles, the U.S. official said. Share this -







Doctors treat patients by candlelight in basement of Mariupol's last hospital Medical staff in the last functioning hospital in the besieged city of Mariupol are treating patients in the basement largely by candlelight, officials said Wednesday. In an effort to save fuel for diesel generators, doctors and nurses at City Hospital No. 1 are only using the machines for complex operations and hemodialysis for cleaning blood, the City Council said. “Right now it is no longer possible to provide the necessary medical procedures for blood purification in renal failure,” the council said. The officials added that, in addition to medical staff and patients, roughly 600 to 700 residents from nearby neighborhoods are sheltering in the facility. “Despite the extremely difficult situation, doctors continue to heroically fulfill their mission — saving lives,” the council said. Earlier Wednesday, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said nearly 3,000 people evacuated the city after weeks of Russian bombardment and allegations Tuesday that civilians were captured while trying to flee. Vereshchuk said buses and other vehicles that successfully left Mariupol were blocked on the outskirts of their destination, Zaporizhia, and unable to enter the city. They would try again Thursday, she said. On Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said roughly 100,000 people remained in a city that once had a population of nearly half a million.

U.S., allies discussing Russia's removal from G-20 The Biden administration and U.S. allies are discussing whether Russia should be removed from the G-20 group of countries that tackles global economic issues, three people familiar with the matter told NBC News. While the U.S. isn’t actively pushing for it, Russia’s removal probably won’t happen in part because China and India, which are Group of 20 members, would likely block the efforts, the three sources said. The G-20 is made up of 19 countries and the European Union. Still, the issue has been discussed at the National Security Council and at a meeting that U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo held last week with Polish Economy Minister Piotr Nowak. Poland has publicly pushed for Russia’s ouster, but a Commerce Department spokesperson said Raimondo “did not express a position on behalf of the U.S. Government” regarding Poland’s proposal to kick Russia out. Calls to remove Russia have grown amid concerns that Russian President Vladimir Putin will attend the G-20 summit in November in Indonesia. Russia was kicked out of the Group of Eight, which mainly focuses on politics, in 2014 after it invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea. The group became the Group of Seven. Share this -







Ukrainians find warm refuge in Spanish town GUISSONA, Spain — As Ukrainian refugees fleeing bombs and bullets at home fan out across Western Europe, few places they arrive feel as welcoming as a Spanish town known for years as “Little Ukraine.” Even before Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine last month, one in seven residents of Guissona was originally from there. Guissona’s population more than doubled to around 7,500 residents, and drew in a lot of immigrant labor, including the Ukrainians, after a regional supermarket chain opened a distribution center nearby two decades ago. More than 3.5 million people have already fled Russia’s war in Ukraine. The refugees are finding safe havens in small communities on the continent where family and friends who went to find work have put down roots. Read the full story. Share this -

Eldar Emric / AP RADAUTI, Romania — Simba the lion and a wolf named Akyla have been evacuated from a zoo in war-torn Ukraine and brought to safety in Romania in what an animal rights group says was a four-day mission “full of dangers” further hampered by border entry bureaucracy.

Russian opposition journalist killed in Kyiv shelling Oksana Baulina, a veteran Russian journalist whose last tweet included the hashtag #MadVlad, referring to President Vladimir Putin, died in a shelling in Kyiv's Podolsk district, according to The Insider, a ""Russia-focused"" independent news outlet. Baulina had been filming the aftermath of a Russian attack on a shopping center when she and three others came under fire. One civilian was also killed, and two people accompanying Baulina were wounded and hospitalized. Prior to joining The Insider, Baulina worked as a producer for the Anti-Corruption Foundation, an opposition nonprofit founded in Moscow and listed as an extremist organization in Russia. She was forced to leave her home country in order to continue exposing Russian government corruption for The Insider, the company said. ""The Insider expresses its deepest condolences to Oksana's family and friends,"" the company said in a statement. ""We will continue to cover the war in Ukraine, including such Russian war crimes as indiscriminate shelling of residential areas which result in the deaths of civilians and journalists."" Friends and former colleagues mourned Baulina's death, praising her ""phenomenal sense of moral clarity"" and denouncing the killing of journalists covering the war in Ukraine. And now it's someone I've known for 16 years and worked with at several independent outlets.

Blinken officially announces Russia has committed war crimes U.S. government finds Russia's government committing war crimes in Ukraine March 23, 2022 01:54 Secretary of State Antony Blinken officially announced Wednesday that Russia has committed war crimes since invading Ukraine. Citing numerous credible reports of indiscriminate attacks, he said several attacks deliberately targeted civilians, including people in a Mariupol maternity hospital, a theater, apartment buildings and schools. “Since launching his unprovoked and unjust war of choice, Russian President Vladimir Putin has unleashed unrelenting violence that has caused death and destruction across Ukraine,” Blinken said in a statement. “Every day that Russia’s forces continue their brutal attacks, the number of innocent civilians killed and wounded, including women and children, climbs.” As of Tuesday, in the besieged city of Mariupol alone, more than 2,400 civilians have been killed, officials said. Not including Mariupol, the United Nations has confirmed more than 2,500 civilian casualties and emphasized the actual toll is likely higher. Share this -

Biden heads to Europe amid pressure to ramp up support for Ukraine BRUSSELS — President Joe Biden heads to Europe Wednesday under increasing pressure at home and abroad to do more to aid Ukraine, as he tries to walk a fine line between providing support and deterring Russia while avoiding further escalation.

Nine corridors to evacuate residents of besieged cities set to open Nine humanitarian corridors to evacuate Ukrainians trapped in besieged cities and towns will open on Wednesday, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. The encircled southern port city of Mariupol, where a devastating humanitarian crisis is unfolding, was included in the list of areas slated for evacuations.

Putin plans to attend G-20 summit, envoy says Putin intends to attend a G-20 summit in Indonesia later this year, Russia’s ambassador to Indonesia said Wednesday, dismissing suggestions by some G-20 members that Russia could be barred from the group of major economies.

Ukrainian forces have been trying in the last few days to regain territory from the Russians, according to a senior US defense official, who described them as “able and willing” to do so.

Here's the situation on the ground:

Counterattacks near the capital: A Ukrainian counterattack north and west of Kyiv appeared to have made some headway, jeopardizing Russian efforts to encircle the capital and threatening the ability of Russian forces to resupply the forward units that are exposed to the north of the city.

Makariv: One such area is Makariv, a strategic town 30 miles (48 kilometers) west of Kyiv. After days of fighting, Ukrainian forces regained control of the town, the Armed Forces of Ukraine said in a Facebook post Tuesday. CNN could not confirm the claim. Makariv had sustained significant damage from ongoing Russian airstrikes, with video showing widespread devastation. If Ukrainian forces consolidate their control of Makariv, it would become more difficult for Russian forces to secure the western approaches to Kyiv and then push further south.

North of Kyiv: There are also indications that Russian forces have suffered setbacks to the north of Kyiv in areas they have held almost since the beginning of the invasion. A brief video geolocated by CNN showed Ukrainian troops walking in the town of Moschun, about 20 miles (35 kilometers) north of the capital. Ukrainian drone video geolocated during the weekend showed the destruction of Russian armor in the same area.

Flooding of Irpin River: Satellite images from Monday showed growing flooding from the Irpin River. CNN previously reported that a dam along the Dnieper River was flooding the Irpin River basin and its tributaries. The river is critical to the Russian advance toward Kyiv; if the Russians cannot cross it, they can't take Kyiv from the west. It's unclear how the dam began flooding: whether the gates were opened on purpose by the Ukrainians, or it was hit by a military strike.

Borodyanka: Some 12 miles (20 kilometers) north of Makariv is the town of Borodyanka, which has been held by Russian and Chechen forces since early in the campaign. If the Ukrainians were to take Borodyanka, forward Russian units could be cut off. The battlefield is fluid, and the Russians could reverse recent losses. But if the Ukrainians hold Makariv and extend their control over the area, Russian positions between the town and Kyiv would become vulnerable, further impeding their goal of pushing south beyond the main east-west highway to encircle the capital.

Kherson and Mykolaiv: A senior US defense official said Ukrainians are fighting to take back the southern city of Kherson, as well as pushing Russian forces from the northeast of Mykolaiv, forcing them to reposition south of the city. The official cautioned that the US cannot say whether these moves are part of a “larger operational plan” by the Ukrainians or not, but called the Ukrainian defense “nimble” and “agile.""",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-23-22/h_31a0df565a264e303010508d560c2178
