That is why I ask you to oppose the war!""

The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valerii Zaluzhnyi also addressed Ukrainians: ""Today we are all Victory soldiers.

14:00 – Zelenskyy addressed NATO: ""I don't blame NATO, I want to be clear here. You are not guilty; it's not your missiles and bombs destroying our cities.

I just want you to know that the Alliance can still prevent the deaths of Ukrainians from Russian strikes by providing us with all the weapons we need.""

The Verkhovna Rada voted in favor of Draft Law 7189, which provides for criminal liability for photo or video recording of the movement of Ukrainian troops. This law amends the Criminal and Criminal Procedure Codes of Ukraine.

Also, from now on, 10 to 12 years of imprisonment is envisaged for cooperation with the aggressor state. Collaborationists are prohibited from holding a number of positions in the future, for a period of 10 to 15 years with possible complete confiscation of property.

The first exchange of prisoners of war took place! ""In exchange for 10 captured occupiers, we pulled out 10 of our servicemen. Also, today we sent 11 Russian civilian sailors to the Russians, whom we rescued from a sunken ship near Odesa. As a result of this exchange, 19 Ukrainian civilian sailors are returning home from the Sapphire rescue ship, which was captured by the occupiers while trying to take our troops from Zmiinyi Island. Under the terms of the exchange, the lifeboat itself will also be returned to Ukraine and sent to a port in Turkey,"" Iryna Vereshchuk said.

Humanitarian corridors

Iryna Vereshchuk named ""green routes"" along which people will be evacuated today:

14:00 – Mariupol City Council reports: Russians are trying to misinform the people of Mariupol as if the evacuation to the territories controlled by the Ukrainian government is no longer carried out. The occupiers' car with a loudspeaker travels through the city and announces that Zaporizhzhia is no longer accepting refugees and they need to go to Russia and that Odesa has already been occupied. All this is occupiers' deliberate misinformation in order to turn the people of Mariupol against their own country. A request to all: spread the truth, write and call your family and friends in Mariupol.

Radiation and chemical threats

Forest fires are raging in the Exclusion Zone near the Chornobyl nuclear power plant, Ukraine has already reported this to the IAEA. At the moment, the occupiers don't allow firefighters into these areas.

Russia is preparing chemical attacks, said the Center for Combating Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council. The Russian Federation is now inciting hysteria over ""laboratories"" in Ukraine that allegedly create chemical weapons. This is how the propaganda media prepares the Russian population to use chemical weapons in order to have a ""cover"" and, if so, to use it themselves.

13:00 – A group of propagandists was brought to the Russian-occupied Chornobyl nuclear power plant to make a fake ""movie"" about the station's work.

The UN Security Council has rejected a draft resolution proposed by Russia on the humanitarian catastrophe in Ukraine. The document, submitted by Russia, called for the protection of civilians and the provision of humanitarian aid. Only Russia and China voted in favor, while all other members of the Security Council abstained. Of course, the rapist country itself does not plead guilty to the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.

The Polish Sejm has officially recognized Putin as a war criminal. The Sejm also strongly condemned the acts of astonishing cruelty and outright genocide perpetrated by Russian fascist troops in Ukraine. The relevant resolution was adopted on March 23, PolskieRadio reports.

EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell said Russia was not yet interested in a ceasefire in Ukraine because its army hadn't achieved its military goals.

Russia, according to Borrell, wants to occupy the entire Ukrainian coast to the border with Moldova and isolate Ukraine from the sea. He noted that the situation regarding Russia's war against Ukraine would be resolved in the next 15 days. Meanwhile, the Allies will continue to provide military assistance to Kyiv, as it is important.

Due to their excessive losses in personnel and equipment, the Russian occupiers are trying to turn the war in Ukraine into a partially ""protracted phase."" The reason for such actions is the lack of any significant progress in all directions.

The Russian Federation proposed to oblige schoolchildren to pray for the glory of Russia every morning before lessons. However, no prayers will help prevent the imminent collapse of the rotten empire.

What about Belarus?

According to operative information, the Russian military leadership is transferring weapons and military equipment from military districts to the territory of Belarus and the temporarily occupied Autonomous Republic of Crimea.

Russian lies

The Kadyrovites ""caught and neutralized Stepan Bandera."" The winning report was published with a photo of Butusov. The Ukrainian journalist himself is alive and well, fighting Russians on the real and information fronts.

Crimean impostor Aksyonov expects a record tourist flow to the Autonomous Republic of Crimea this year. But in fact, a record flow of 200 cargo and 300 cargo has already arrived.

Illiterate Russian orcs painted a new fake, explaining why Russia attacked Ukraine and why Russia is getting death notes. Now they say that Ukraine has made a medal for the ""Capture of Crimea."" But again, they received an F for their incompetent work:

Not capture, but release;

Not an order, but a decree;

Not Crimea, but the Autonomous Republic of Crimea;

Not V.A. Zelensky, and V.O. Zelenskyy

The quality of Photoshop is no comment.
