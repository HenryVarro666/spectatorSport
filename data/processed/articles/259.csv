The speed with which they were put in place, against a country whose economy ranks among the dozen largest in the world, was remarkable.

The sanctions are so strong that they were described as an “all-out economic and financial war” by Bruno Le Maire, the French economic minister, a comment so frank and potentially inflammatory that he immediately walked it back.

The measures, which include sanctions targeting Russia’s financial system, the wealth of powerful individuals, and Russian fossil fuels, are designed to punish Vladimir Putin and the oligarchs who support and depend on him, and hobble the Russian economy. They make it impossible to conduct normal business in Russia.

In the short term, that means a massive economic slowdown: The Russian stock market has been shuttered since the invasion, and many Russian companies with shares listed abroad have seen their equity values all but wiped out. The Russian ruble, which plunged as the war began and sanctions were rolled out, is now near an all-time low.

Sanctions are a uniquely powerful foreign policy tool in American hands because so much of the world economy is conducted in US dollars and ultimately subject in some way to US law.

In Washington, DC, sanctions are sometimes wryly referred to as the “first resort of US foreign policy,” sanctions researcher Edoardo Saravalle said in an interview. “The rules of the US financial system are, to only slightly exaggerate, the rules of the global financial system,” he said. “And Washington [can] kind of weaponize this.”

That uniquely American power to regulate global commerce through the US dollar system has grown stronger as the world’s economy has become more intertwined. Globalization has meant that more and more economic activity flows through an extremely small number of chokepoints, controlled by the United States and its close European allies. Over many years, the US has also built out a significant regulatory apparatus, controlled by the executive branch, to police those chokepoints very effectively. So any sanctions policy the US puts in place can be carried out quickly and with great effect.

Right now, Russia is now feeling the full power of those chokepoints being turned off by the US and its allies, but sanctions’ power is so uniquely American that the US can even go against its putative allies’ wishes, as the Trump administration did with Iran after it pulled out of the nuclear deal, without leaving the rest of the world much recourse.

In the coming weeks and months, Russian companies will have to adjust their operations to the reality of a shrunken economy and try to find ways to do business within the new constraints they face.

Russia’s economy will shrink 35 percent in the second quarter of 2022 and 7 percent for the entire year, JPMorgan estimates. Overall, the US bank expects the economic impact of sanctions on Russia’s economy to be on par with the slowdowns it experienced in the financial crisis in 2008 or the Covid-19 pandemic. Russia is also dealing with additional complications, one being a wave of corporate withdrawals from its economy, reflecting executives’ reluctance to be anywhere close to the red line of sanctions. And unlike in those earlier crises, large portions of the rest of the world are not acting to, say, rescue the global economy.

“We are inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine” —President Joe Biden

Instead, the Western world is working in remarkable unison to punish Russia economically in the hope that waging war against Ukraine will ultimately become so expensive and ineffective that Putin will seek a negotiated end to his invasion.

The aim of the sanctions is clear. “We are inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine,” President Joe Biden said in his State of the Union address. “Putin is now isolated from the world more than ever.”

It’s tempting to think that such a sudden slowdown cannot be sustainable, but badly damaged economies can stagger forward in quite a diminished state for an extended period, Cornell professor and sanctions expert Nicholas Mulder has pointed out.

For sanctions to truly work as a means to their intended end, Western policymakers “must also promptly outline clear conditions for the removal of sanctions to encourage de-escalation and an end to this catastrophic war,” he wrote. It’s not yet clear what outcome would be considered sufficient to end the sanctions — either the official variety or the voluntary actions taken by businesses that now range from Visa to McDonald’s.

How financial sanctions work — and why crypto can’t overcome them

The sanctions put in place by the US and Europe fall into two broad categories: financial, meaning they deal with the banking system and capital markets; and economic, meaning they affect the rest of Russia’s economy.

On the financial front, Russian President Vladimir Putin and 11 other top Russian government officials have been hit personally with sanctions by the US Treasury Department. Their names have been added to the Specially Designated Nationals list, a compendium of entities and individuals that includes terrorists, drug cartel leaders, and government officials from countries like North Korea, Iran, and Venezuela. Being included on the list effectively means that any assets held in the global banking system are frozen and Americans are legally barred from doing business with those individuals.

Several Russian oligarchs are also facing sanctions, and the US Justice Department and some European law enforcement agencies are working to confiscate non-financial assets like real estate and yachts from those billionaires.

The financial sanctions go well beyond individuals and any companies they may use to hold assets. The US has also placed sanctions on Russia’s central bank and “immobilized” the reserves it held in the US financial system. The European Union put in place similar sanctions, meaning it has been impossible for Russia to use its $630 billion in reserves to help prop up the ruble by, for instance, selling US dollars or euros it holds and buying its own currency, or from using those reserves to make purchases to further the war effort.

The US also cut off Russia’s largest bank, Sberbank, which holds a third of the country’s banking assets, from the US banking system. It froze all assets held in the US financial system by VTB Bank, Russia’s second-largest bank, which holds a fifth of the country’s assets, and barred Americans from doing business with it.

Russian state-owned companies, including Sberbank and Gazprom, the oil and gas giant, are also now blocked from accessing US bond and equity markets.

One action by the European Union with US support has gotten the most attention: removing the banking sector from SWIFT, the main messaging system used in the international banking system.

SWIFT (named after the Belgian group that runs it, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) is sometimes mistaken for the banking system itself because of its importance. But it doesn’t touch individual bank accounts — instead, it is the electronic messaging system that is used to send and receive cross-border payment instructions between banks. More than 11,000 different banks use SWIFT, and it was used in about 70 percent of transfers in Russia; while Russia has worked to develop a parallel system in order to reduce the impact of exactly this type of sanction, it is not widely used.

But there is one massive hole in the SWIFT sanctions, carved out by necessity: energy. Europe is reliant on Russia for natural gas. Last year, the EU imported 155 billion cubic meters of gas from Russia, or about 40 percent of its total natural gas used, according to the International Energy Agency. Europe can’t run its power plants and heat its homes without Russian gas, and the pipelines that send gas west have not been shut down; in fact, during the first day of the invasion, the amount of gas sent from Russia in pipelines across Ukraine to Western Europe actually increased.

And, of course, in order to keep the natural gas flowing, someone has to pay for it, and someone else has to receive that payment. As a result, Russia’s central bank, Sberbank, and the financial arm of Gazprom are excluded from the SWIFT removal because they are the main Russian institutions that receive gas payments from Europe and there isn’t a way to, for example, ban them from using SWIFT for all purposes except for gas payments.

Notably, the Swiss government has also said it will drop its long-held neutral stance and join in the sanctions by freezing Russian assets, including bank accounts.

Evading the sanctions that have crippled the traditional Russian banking system would seem like the moment crypto was made to meet — after all, the largest cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was created to allow for anonymous individuals to directly send money with no possibility of government interference.

But Putin and the Russian economy can’t survive on crypto alone for two important reasons.

The first is the overall size of the global crypto market, which is currently around $2 trillion, with bitcoin representing just over $800 billion. Compared to Russia’s $630 billion in international reserves, which the country has been prohibited from using in the Western banking system, that’s just not that much.

As Lloyd Blankfein, the former head of Goldman Sachs, succinctly put it, when it comes to using crypto to avoid wide-reaching sanctions put in place against an economy the size of Russia’s, “there isn’t enough now, and it’s not liquid enough.”

The problem for Russia’s central bank isn’t that it doesn’t have money — it’s that it cannot use any of the money it does have. Those currency reserves are frozen, so even if Russia decided it wanted to do something fanciful, like buy almost all of the world’s existing bitcoin, how would it pay for it? Russia can’t buy large cryptocurrencies for the same reason it can’t sell dollars and buy rubles: It can’t buy or sell anything.

More sanctions are aimed at Russia’s economy

The US has also put in place controls that block companies from sending a wide array of goods to Russia, including aviation, defense, and shipping components, along with higher-tech items like semiconductors and telecom equipment.

Those US export controls are intended to hurt Russia’s ability to get its hands on the kinds of manufactured goods it needs to wage a lengthy war, but they are also intended to hobble high-value manufacturing and other domestic economic activity that is not strictly related to the war effort, such as commercial aviation, which will not find it very hard to source replacement parts for its planes. There is also an almost total embargo against US companies exporting anything to the Russian military.

The US has also taken a step that even just a week ago seemed beyond what it was willing to do: The Biden administration banned the import of Russian oil, natural gas, and coal into the US.

While mainland Europe has not gone along with the US on this sanction, simply due to the fact that it is far more reliant on Russian energy imports and has basically no viable alternative, the UK said shortly after the US announced its import ban that it would seek to end Russian energy imports by the end of the year.

A host of large global corporations have also voluntarily severed business ties with Russia in recent days in a fit of what sanctions watchers call “overcompliance”: There is no legal necessity for them to cut out their Russian counterparts, but executives have calculated that continuing to do business in the country is not worth the reputational damage or operational hassle.

For instance, Mastercard and Visa have ceased Russian operations. Maersk, the global shipping behemoth, has suspended Russian bookings; ExxonMobil said it it is pulling out of a big oil and gas project in Russia and will make no new investments in the country; BP is abandoning its almost 20 percent stake in Rosneft at an expected loss of $25 billion; and Shell is shedding its ties to Gazprom, though it has purchased Russian oil on the open market recently.

Such a long and growing list of global corporations refusing to do business with a sanctioned country is not unprecedented — Western corporations have similarly severed ties with Iran, for instance — but, as with the sanctions themselves, that it has happened over the course of days and not decades, and that it is happening to the 11th-largest economy in the world, is completely new.

The dynamics that have led to the corporate withdrawal provide insight into one of the ways US sanctions can be so punitive: No large Western company can stomach being seen to do business with a sanctioned entity, even if the business it is doing is strictly allowed under the terms of the sanctions. The “reputational risk,” in corporate terms, is too high.

What comes next?

Unfortunately for Russia, the sanctions put in place by the US and the West are extremely comprehensive, and working around them to avoid a sustained economic downturn will be effectively impossible.

An influential 2019 academic paper written by Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman argued that decades of economic globalization, far from weakening the power of sanctions, has actually made them an even stronger tool because “some countries—most prominently the U.S.—are able to cut businesses or even entire countries out of these global networks, with profound economic consequences.”

Presciently, they wrote when their paper was released that “proper participation in the world economy requires access to global networks such as the dollar clearing system and the SWIFT financial network. We live in an interdependent world, but one where the dependencies are asymmetric.”

In other words, the options for Russia appear bleak. An attempt at forging greater economic and financial ties with China is likely, and because the two countries previously had lower levels of business ties than Iran and China did when Iran was recently hit with US sanctions, such a shift may offer a real growth opportunity. But even a marked uptick in Russia-China trade cannot offset American and European sanctions.

As a result, Russia will face a shrinking economy while it is on a wartime footing, with the US and Europe seemingly counting on sanctions to draw Putin into negotiations to alleviate some of the financial pain.

""It's a highly risky strategy,"" he said. The Ukrainian resistance cannot hold the fort for much longer, and sanctions by the West won't be able to stop Russia in time, he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Friday. He said the U.S. is relying heavily on sanctions and ""very belated arms deliveries"" to Ukraine, but he's concerned that those fighting for Ukraine won't be able to defend the country for long. Though the Russians have sustained more casualties than expected, they are still ""advancing steadily,"" he said. ""The assumption that this is going to drag out, that the United States can sit back and watch the economic sanctions do their work may be gravely mistaken,"" Ferguson said.

There's no guarantee that Ukraine holds out, and what I dread is steadily worse news from Ukraine, and the breakdown of Ukraine's defenses. Niall Ferguson Senior fellow at the Hoover Institution

Anna Ohanyan of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (CEIP) echoed that sentiment. ""While the sanctions will start biting — perhaps can change Putin's behavior down the road — at this point, they cannot be relied on as an instrument to be used to stop the violence,"" said Ohanyan, a nonresident senior scholar in CEIP's Russia and Eurasia program. ""It won't work fast enough to avert a Russian victory in Ukraine and I think this is the critical problem,"" Ferguson said.

The U.S. and its allies have imposed wide-ranging sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. But it appears that there's a race between Russia's military advancements and the sanctions that are crippling Moscow. ""There's no guarantee that Ukraine holds out, and what I dread is steadily worse news from Ukraine, and the breakdown of Ukraine's defenses,"" Ferguson said. ""We'll sit there saying, oh, well the sanctions have really hurt Russia — but it won't matter to Putin because he will be able to claim victory. That for me is the nightmare scenario,"" he added. Ferguson said the U.S. should help support Ukraine's defenses without escalating it into a full-blown NATO-Russia war. Arms deliveries to Ukraine slowed down previously, and now there is a ""frantic effort"" to help Ukraine keep up the fight, he said. That, however, may create the conditions of a proxy war, CEIP's Ohanyan said. ""It appears that unfortunately, [at] this point, sanctions and the military assistance work at cross purposes,"" she said.

Opportunity for a deal

Ferguson also said the U.S. is ""missing an opportunity"" by leaning on sanctions. He said he believes that a deal can be made between Russia and Ukraine if Kyiv is willing to accept neutrality and take NATO membership off the table. He pointed to a 2014 proposal that former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger published, presenting the idea of Ukraine being a neutral country instead of attempting to join NATO. ""It is clear that President Zelenskyy is open to that idea, which is a major shift in Ukraine's position for the sake of trying to save his country from further destruction,"" he said. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy this week told ABC News that he has ""cooled down"" regarding the question of joining NATO. He said Ukraine understands that NATO doesn't want to accept it into the alliance, and the country will not beg to be allowed into NATO.",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/11/waiting-for-sanctions-to-stop-russia-could-go-terribly-wrong-niall-ferguson.html
2,f6e31d03-5f48-41f2-b955-1ce66ee88c1b,"['Annie Lowrey', 'About The Author']",2022-03-10 12:00:00+00:00,"The United States, the European Union, and countries around the world have cut Russia out of the global economy. Moscow’s central bank is struggling to support the ruble. Russian financial institutions are blocked from the global payments system. Far-reaching import and export bans have choked off trade to and from the country. Russian markets have seized up. Will these sanctions pressure Vladimir Putin to withdraw the Russian military from Ukraine? Or will their main effect be to hurt Russian civilians and damage the world economy?

This week, I put those questions to Nicholas Mulder, a historian at Cornell University who recently published The Economic Weapon: The Rise of Sanctions as a Tool of Modern War. The book traces the history of sanctions from the Peloponnesian War to today, with particular focus on the development of modern sanctions in the period between the two world wars.

Read our ongoing coverage of the Russian invasion in Ukraine

Mulder finds that sanctions have always proved controversial, given their capacity to immiserate, impoverish, and injure civilians. He also shows that sanctions have often failed to achieve their desired political outcome, for all the damage they cause. Indeed, in the 20th century, sanctions were partially successful or wholly successful just one-third of the time, with their efficacy degrading as their use has expanded in recent decades. “The history of sanctions is largely a history of disappointment,” he writes.

We discussed what makes sanctions successful, what makes them harmful, what Washington might want, and what Moscow might accept. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

Annie Lowrey: The United States has sanctioned Moscow’s central bank. Other financial institutions have been kicked off SWIFT, part of the global payments system. PayPal, Visa, and Mastercard are no longer working in the country. The economy is collapsing. How unusual are these sanctions, from a historical perspective?

Nicholas Mulder: We’re in totally new territory. The speed, the sweep, and the size of the sanctions, or the size of the targets of the sanctions—those three factors make them extraordinary. An intense sanctions package came together—supported not only by the U.S. but by the entire European Union and a number of Asian allies as well—within four or five days of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. And there’s potentially more coming.

Before this, the states that were targeted by sanctions tended to be U.S. adversaries or adversaries of the West, but many of them were small- or medium-sized—Iran, Venezuela, North Korea, also the Taliban government in Afghanistan. They are significant actors in their regions, but they’re not hugely important in terms of the global economy.

Lowrey: Right, Russia is both large and very interconnected with its neighbors and the world.

Mulder: On top of the government sanctions, there is an enormous global private-sector reaction. It’s a divestment wave. To some degree, that process is people overreacting to sanctions, or acting beyond the scope of the sanctions.

The fact that we have these combined state and private-sector sanctions means that they are hitting not only the Russian government, but Russian civil society and the private economy as well. It’s a major shock for them. It makes the discussions about whether the sanctions are working or are going to work much more difficult, because we are seeing the economic effects being caused by private actors, not just by governments anymore.

I’ll note: The fact that PayPal and Mastercard and Visa are no longer working there has enormous implications for the large number of liberal Russians who are fleeing the country now, who can no longer access their money, their savings. I know of many people who have fled to Central Asia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Finland, Uzbekistan. None of them can actually access their savings anymore, because their bank cards just don’t work. The private-sector response is hitting Russian civil society really hard.

I am sure that there are people who think this adds to the total pressure, but it is hitting the people who we would want to be a backbone of the anti-war position in Russia.

Lowrey: Looking historically, would we expect as comprehensive and serious an economic blockade as this one to be effective?

Mulder: I wouldn’t want to ascribe everything that’s gone wrong with Russia in the last few years to the sanctions [that have been in place since 2014]. But it’s clear that our [preexisting] sanctions haven’t solved the problem. That should make us a little bit more circumspect. We have tried this at a lower level of intensity. But that doesn’t mean that increasing the intensity is going to fix the problem.

The idea behind sanctions is that we apply pressure in ways that make countries do what the West would like them to do. But that requires a specific set of circumstances. The situation isn’t always right. And when you apply sanctions, it can happen that countries move in the opposite direction.

Lowrey: There’s surely concern about Putin feeling backed into a corner and like he has nothing to lose. So how do you structure these sanctions to give the best shot at changing Russia’s behavior?

Mulder: The important thing is to have clarity about the aims of the sanctions. Our governments in the West have said the end of Russian aggression against Ukraine, the withdrawal of all troops and equipment, and respect for the territorial integrity and independence of Ukraine is the goal. But in imposing the new sanctions, they haven’t reiterated it. There is not a common, clearly shared U.S.-European position.

That fosters speculation about the goal maybe being regime change. If you are a paranoid Russian nationalist right now, that would be a very plausible interpretation. That raises the stakes. It makes it existential. It increases the chance of [the Kremlin] having an adverse response.

Lowrey: What steps could you imagine the United States and Europe laying out to start to bargain and de-escalate?

Mulder: The key model for success here is the Iran deal that [Barack] Obama and [former Secretary of State John] Kerry negotiated. It’s the most successful use of American sanctions in the 21st century so far.

The nuclear-nonproliferation treaty outlawed Iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons. But it did say Iran had the right to civilian nuclear energy. [Obama and Kerry] made it very clear they were making a concession on that. They said: We know that many people are uncomfortable with anything that has nuclear and Iran in the same sentence. You have the right to civilian nuclear reactors, not nuclear weapons. If you pursue the latter, we will impose sanctions, but if you give that up and make your stockpiles of nuclear fuel inspectable by a neutral UN international agency, we will remove the sanctions in stages.

Given that Russia is even more powerful and is a nuclear-armed state, we should make clarity, to the degree that we can, the absolute priority. We just can’t afford errors or a major escalation.

Lowrey: Can you only get to the point of negotiating the removal of sanctions—if you do X, we will lift Y and provide Z—once the invasion is over?

Mulder: Tying conditions to the lifting of sanctions could already be happening. If you stop bombing, you stop advancing, you stop shooting, you cease offensive military operations, we can unfreeze part of the central-bank reserves. If you withdraw to the positions you had before Thursday, the 24th of February, before the invasion, we can roll back another tranche. If you remove support for the separatists in the Donbas, then we can reconnect you to SWIFT.

If there is a perception in the world, or on the part of Russia, that these are going to be permanent and they’re going to be there no matter what Russia does, they will just be a weapon to wreck Russian society and the economy with. I don’t think that will lead to the kind of longer-term international situation that we want to pursue.

Lowrey: In the sense that destroying the Russian economy is not in and of itself the goal?

Mulder: It is not the consensus position in Western governments, but some people support sanctions as a form of long-term economic war. They’ve given up on the idea that we can ever change Russian behavior. To them, the point is simply to degrade Russian capacity to do harm.

There are four ways we can think about sanctions working. First, there’s the deterrent function. That was what we tried from December until two weeks ago, then the war happened. Second, there’s the compellent function: We are going to try and force Putin out of Ukraine and force him to end this war. Third, maybe we can cause regime change or a change in government. That’s a pretty ambitious goal. The fourth one is this: Behavioral change is impossible. You’re never going to change behavior. So deterrence and compellence are moot, basically, and it is futile to try them. Instead, this is purely the long-run degrading of Russian power. This is attrition, exhausting them as an adversary.

Right now, it’s not really clear whether our goal is two, three, or four. It’s only clear that No. 1 didn’t work, because the war happened.

Lowrey: The Afghanistan sanctions are much less prevalent in the minds of Americans. But it does feel like they might fall into that last category, at least in part. We’re in the midst of causing a devastating humanitarian crisis we are simultaneously trying to ameliorate with aid.

Mulder: The conditions we’re imposing—it’s not that the Taliban cease the war, because they’re in control now. It’s about human-rights issues, about the treatment of women. The thing that makes the Afghanistan situation different is because it’s so insignificant to the world economy; the issue is almost purely a moral and a humanitarian one.

There are a whole bunch of other rationales and dilemmas going into the Russia sanctions … the threat of nuclear escalation, the issue of global economic stability. Russia is a massive commodity exporter. The sanctions are already having large effects on markets and on commodity prices. Then there’s the efficacy concerns. Russia is doing something actively awful that we want to stop as soon as possible. There are utilitarian, rational arguments at play—it’s one of the problems that comes with using such measures against a much larger, much more interconnected society.

I consider sanctions that inflict damage on entire populations and their economic life to be morally fraught, and the essential reason is this: If we embark on policies premised on the idea that bad governments and their people are one, then we have bought into a way of thinking that comes perilously close to how ultranationalists and fascists see the world. If total economic sanctions are the weapon to which liberal internationalism resorts to defend itself, then in a sense the totalitarians will have won. To my mind, any liberalism worth its name should support and defend individual dissent and resistance against oppressive and dictatorial governments, not punish those unfortunate enough to find themselves living under such regimes.

Lowrey: Are there technological or technocratic innovations in this sanctions package we should be watching?

Mulder: This ban on high-tech components exported to Russia. That’s one part of the sanctions supported not only by the U.S. and the EU, but also by Singapore, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan—the major semiconductor-manufacturing hubs of the world.

It’s a very big one because it’s going to have a medium-to-long-run effect on the capacity of the Russian economy to keep up its productivity growth and its ability to source components and hardware for its military industry. But it also has real elements of a dry run for using this sort of measure against China—that’s why those Asian countries are part of it, I think. It’s a diplomatic exercise: If we can do this with Russia, could we do it in the future with China?

It also includes something called a foreign-direct-product rule, which basically forbids the export or trade of products made in the United States or made using U.S. software or intellectual property. The U.S. will put sanctions on any Singaporean trying to sell these chips manufactured in Singapore, because the intellectual property for them was designed in Palo Alto.

Lowrey: What kind of economic impact could we expect that to have?

Mulder: Technological innovation matters only in the medium-to-long run. No country is going to collapse immediately when you cut off the supply of microchips. People can still eat. They can still warm their houses. They can still put ammunition in their guns and fuel in their tanks. But it is going to be a problem when you have to build new tanks and new airplanes, or when you want to design a 5G network. The U.S. had already imposed sanctions like this against Huawei, the Chinese 5G firm, back in 2019. But now we’re seeing these used against Russia by a much larger group of countries.

Technological innovation is a double-edged sword, because when you cut off people’s access to it—if there’s one thing we know about the history of innovation, it’s that when you try and monopolize something, people are going to try and find ways of improving on it that are not covered by the monopoly.

Lowrey: What about crypto as a technological tool for sanctions evasion? Is it just the new gold, a way for people to get money in and out? Or has it changed something more profound?

Mulder: I think its viability as an alternative global reserve currency is exaggerated. It offers some evasion possibilities, but not at the scale where an economy the size of Russia’s is going to be able to derive great benefit from it. That has to do somewhat with the fact that the practical case for crypto, for bitcoin as a currency you pay with on a day-to-day basis, has diminished. It’s a speculative asset, a store of wealth, but I don’t think anyone seriously—even the big crypto firms that have gone public on Wall Street, like Coinbase—believes it’s going to be displacing the dollar.

Lowrey: There were some stories about Russians buying things like Prada handbags and gold as stores of value and ways to get rubles out. Yachts and apartments in London seem a less secure way to do that, given that the U.S. and European countries are going after the oligarchs’ property assets.

Mulder: The assets of very wealthy people aren’t off the table. That has interesting implications for other policy discussions we’re having. For years, we heard about how impossible it is to find offshore, hidden wealth—it’s too hidden. But it turns out we can just take people’s yachts.

This has happened before, and this was key to economic warfare in World Wars I and II, particularly in World War I. Before 1914, the fin de siècle world economy was extremely globalized. Lots of people had foreign investments. World War I was the first time you had total war in economies with large overseas-wealth concentrations. That wealth became fair game. All the countries expropriated enemy property within their own jurisdictions. When they did it again in World War II, by that time, under the Nazis, Germany had become much more inward-focused and self-sufficient. It was no longer this globalized, wealthy society as it had been before.

Lowrey: The oligarchs clearly felt the need to get their money out of Russia and into dollar or euro assets. Now what do they do?

Mulder: In Putin’s regime, the essential, implicit bargain made between him and the oligarchs was: If you want to be wealthy and have all this property, do not meddle in politics. Especially not in foreign policy. There’s this running joke: One of the oligarchs goes to Putin and says, “I have had $4 billion out of my $5 billion in wealth seized!” And Putin responds, “Would you like to keep the remaining billion as well?” That’s the dynamic: They are suffering from these expropriations, but it’s not clear they can translate that into sway over the policy-making process.",https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/03/russia-sanctions-economic-policy-effects/627009/

Chelsea can no longer sell tickets or sign players.

These moves were the latest part of an international campaign to damage Russia’s economy and isolate Russian elites. Chelsea’s owner, Roman Abramovich, is close to Vladimir Putin and is one of seven oligarchs whose assets Britain froze yesterday.

The threat of sanctions did not prevent President Vladimir Putin’s war, but the reality of them may help to end it. While hopeful voices have wondered if sanctions might produce enough popular discontent inside Russia to cause Putin to reverse course, this is unlikely.

Instead, while no one can say definitively when the war will end, we can expect that it will end with a settlement. No matter how poorly his military seems to be doing—and it appears they are performing quite poorly indeed—Putin retains capacity to draw out the conflict into a bloody, rolling horror in the months to come.

The strength and severity of the sanctions and their palpable effect on the Russian economy are likely to incentivize Putin to seek a settlement sooner than he otherwise would and could offer bargaining chips to counter some of Russia’s most egregious demands.

To be clear, the sanctions won’t lead to a good deal soon; the deal will still be bad and too late, but not as bad and as late as it might have been.

And even if they don’t help end this war, they are important both as an immediate step toward accountability and as a potential deterrent to other actors in the future.

Krzysztof Bledowski Council Director and senior economist at the Manufacturers Alliance for Productivity and Innovation

It depends on whose sanctions.

Russia had factored in the sanctions cost of the war before triggering it. The actual breadth and depth of sanctions alongside private capital flight, trade restrictions, and diplomatic ostracism probably surprised the Kremlin. But there also exists in Russia a cost-benefit calculation when it comes to stopping the war short of its goal. And here, the cost of failure—not overthrowing the Kyiv government and subjugating the population—must also be set against the burden of the West’s sanctions.

Aside from the West, there’s one other global power whose economic and strategic capacity makes a difference in the Kremlin’s calculations, and that’s China.

When Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela suffocated under the West’s sanctions, these countries could count on Russia and China to evade some of them. So long as Beijing straddles the fence, Russia’s economy won’t implode. It will experience hyperinflation, its living standards will erode, and its long-term growth will decline. But it will muddle through. However, should China signal it is prepared to shadow the West’s sanctions, the calculations in Moscow would change.

Alas, it is not clear whether for Beijing, the advantages of China’s lining up with the West would make up for the costs of a rupture with Russia.

Robert Cooper Council member at the European Council on Foreign Relations

Yes. But sanctions are only one element. The story begins with the horror of Russia’s attack on Ukraine, its neighbor and cousin; then the courageous, inspiring resistance of a united Ukrainian people. Add to that the crushing economic penalties, cutting Russia off from the global system and, in a world where we are all joined together, anything is possible. In war, wrote Napoleon, the moral stands to the material in a ratio of three to one.

These sanctions are different from past cases such as Cuba or South Africa. Those aimed at regime change. With Ukraine, the plan is simpler: empty the war chest and stop the war. If President Vladimir Putin falls too, that would be a bonus.

Martin Ehl Chief analyst at Hospodářské noviny

These are the most comprehensive sanctions any superpower or major developed country has had to face since 1945.

So one would expect them to work. But even experts warn that sanctions per se are not the instrument for winning wars—as history teaches us. At this moment in time, these sanctions are an irreplaceable tool the international community can use against the Russian regime.

I am not naive to think that Russians will rise up against Vladimir Putin immediately due to the impossibility to use Apple Pay. And I also do not believe the unprecedented unity of the democratic West would survive a longer period.

But for the here and now, these sanctions could significantly contribute to persuading the Russian government to stop fighting because they show the unity of the West, a unity which nobody—neither us nor Putin—imagined possible about three weeks ago.

Theresa Fallon Director of the Centre for Russia, Europe, Asia Studies (CREAS)

Sanctions as such cannot end the war. They can create hardship for the Russian population, but historically Russians are used to suffering and the official Russian propaganda will put the blame for the sanctions squarely on the West.

Propaganda will paint the sanctions as unjust persecution of Russia by its enemies and will try to use them to rally the people around the regime. Only a minority have access to outside information and are ready to protest against the government.

Sanctions will make Russia more dependent on trade with China, increasingly making Russia the junior partner in the China-Russia de facto alliance, which I call “Chinusia.” This will give China access to Russia’s vast natural resources, feeding China’s economic growth and military buildup.

On the other hand, sanctions will hurt the economic interests of Russia’s economic, security, and political elites (oligarchs). It is still possible for a small elite to thrive, even under sanctions and in conditions of economic isolation, as in North Korea. However, is Russia comparable to North Korea? If the sanctions against Russia are sustained, there is a hope that Russia’s elites may act to put pressure on Putin to change course, or they may try to replace Putin with a new leader altogether.

Geoff Kitney Writer and commentator on Australian and international affairs

When Vladimir Putin visited Australia the one and only time in September 2007 for an APEC meeting, a journalist asked him what he thought of Australia, to which he replied: “I never think about Australia.”

Despite its remoteness from Russia, Australia has vigorously joined the global action to sanction Russia—not just to hurt Russia but also to warn China.

Australian leaders believe that widely enforced sanctions are setting the Russian economy back decades. Australia wants Beijing to see how united global action to cripple Russia is the price to be paid for military adventurism of a kind it is contemplating toward Taiwan.

Australia sees its biggest long-term security threat coming from what it calls “an arc of autocracy” formed by a strategic alliance between Russia and China. Australia believes the free world’s response to Russia’s Ukraine war must be so strong that it will force China to pause for thought about the likely cost of a military takeover of Taiwan: that it may not be necessary for the West to go to war to make China an economically damaged, pariah nation.

From Australia’s point of view, even if sanctions don’t end the war in Ukraine quickly, their success will also be measured by the strength of the message it sends to China.

John C. Kornblum Former U.S. ambassador to Germany

No. Sanctions alone cannot do the job. They are a limited tool substituted for more difficult alternatives. The same was the case in 2014, after the Russian takeover of Crimea, and in 1968 and 1979 after Prague and Kabul.

I managed a sanctions package against Serbia in 1996 and 1997. In the end, it was the NATO bombing which forced then president Slobodan Milošević to pull back. But NATO cooperation on sanctions was essential to agreeing the military option.

Sanctions may help stop the Russian attack, but they will not change Russian behavior overnight. Sanctions will help us maintain the moral high ground, especially with the Russian people.

Thirty years ago, our Russian partners wanted a fresh start. Today, we may be forced to deal with Vladimir Putin as we did with Milošević in Serbia. We probably can’t expect a return to the Charter of Paris, but at the same time cannot modify it to meet Russian demands.

Fifty years ago, German Social Democrat Willy Brandt and then U.S. secretary of state Henry Kissinger defined Western principles in a way that both Russia and China found acceptable. Thirty years have passed since current arrangements were agreed upon. Even without Russian attacks, it would be time to bring some of the agreements up to date, just as we did with the Charter of Paris and the Helsinki Summit in 1992. The active application of sanctions will be essential in helping to define future goals.

Stefan Meister Head of the International Order and Democracy program at the German Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP)

The most comprehensive sanctions Western countries have ever enacted against Russia seriously hit the Russian state, society, and economy. After these sanctions, Russia will not be like it was before. It is about changing the way of life for the Russian people and decoupling the country from the global economy.

At the same time, even if they are important, sanctions will not stop Russian President Vladimir Putin in his war against Ukraine. Putin is on an historical mission to get Ukraine back at any cost. He has prepared this war over the years while he built a repressive apparat for any internal opposition and securitized all parts of the Russian state where the economy has to serve as an instrument to resist any kind of sanctions.

Russian oligarchs depend more on the Russian state than they are able to resist Putin’s policy.

Even if people in the system are shocked by what Putin is doing, for the time being, they fall into patriotism or apathy. Sanctions will work in the medium term, but then there might be no Ukrainian state anymore and Russia may be so isolated that the West lacks any impact. Ukraine is fighting for European security and needs any means to resist the Russian attack. Sanctions alone will not stop Putin.

Mariann Őry Head of the foreign desk at Magyar Hírlap

Western sanctions alone will most likely not end the war in Ukraine.

They were never enough to change the fundamental geopolitical stance of Russia. Putin has a certain goal to reach and Russia has probably prepared to deal with most of these sanctions.

Of course, it’s also possible that the sanctions will change the course of events. Even though Putin underestimated the EU’s and the United States’ willingness to make sacrifices, these sanctions will hurt the West too.

Some of sanctions and the decisions made by big companies are aimed at making the Russian people put pressure on their government. It is very hard to estimate by Western logic and experience how the Russian people will react. Sanctions can also have far-reaching consequences. Pushing Russia toward China and India can create a new geopolitical reality.

Marc Pierini Visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is unfolding in the most brutal fashion imaginable and there is little clarity about the endgame. But, if Grozny and Aleppo are any meaningful yardsticks of Russian military operations, it is doubtful that, at this very moment, Western sanctions have any effect on the Kremlin. There are two reasons for this.



The first one is that, by virtue of the current pattern of Western European imports of gas, oil, and coal, Russia is still earning some $600-700 million per day—enough to fuel a massive war for a long period of time.



The second reason is that the Kremlin’s political motivations for such a massive invasion are solidly cast in ideology and history. They are packaged in fabricated narratives and the media are all but suppressed.



Over the medium term, though, incremental sanctions will have two effects. They will vastly increase the cost of war for Russia and will cut it off from the West, its main source of income. They will also make the consequences of the invasion visible to each citizen of Russia, each policymaker, and each general. Even in Russia, that may matter.

Clara Portela Professor of political science at the University of Valencia

The big unknown is whether sanctions will have the effect of ending the war in Ukraine, or if they will intensify President Vladimir Putin’s resolve to “win” back Ukraine, or trigger more anti-Putin, anti-war demonstrations in Russia. The answer is that sanctions can, theoretically, do all of these.

Sanctions are generally unsuitable to stop war: they are no match to military force in terms of speed. The impact of force can be immediate; sanctions take time to work. This is true despite the shock effect sanctions often cause. Financial sanctions, which made up the bulk of recent sanctions waves, have some effects even before they are implemented, such as impacting markets adversely.

But by the time they start strangling the economy—particularly one that has shielded itself against sanctions—military operations might have very little of Ukraine’s territory left to cover.

This said, sanctions could work without strangling the economy. They might inflict or threaten sufficient harm on Russian elites to compel them to withdraw support from their current leaders. No autocrat can survive without elite support. Elites will back autocrats for as long as it is profitable, but not one minute longer.

Or the elites may prove instrumental in disrupting the Kremlin’s official narrative that sanctions are “anti-Russian.” If there is something that the intensifying, coordinated Western effort is making clear to the Russian population is that the measures are a reaction to the invasion of Ukraine, and not to any alleged bias against Russia.

Tatiana Romanova Political scientist, Russia

Sanctions perform an important role for the West, but they will not bring an immediate end to Russia’s “special military operation.”

Firstly, the threats of Western sanctions were omnipresent earlier this year. That made many Russians believe that sanctions would have been imposed whatever Russia did.

Secondly, most sanctions hardly affect the so called “deep people,” the core of the Kremlin’s electorate.

These people don’t have business contacts in the West. They do not travel abroad. They never had Western shops in their cities. They will feel the impact of inflation, of job losses, but they are used to it and they will concentrate on their survival, believing that they are making the sacrifice for an important cause, for national security. This is a classical rallying around the flag.

People affected the most are the middle class. They will find themselves in the crossfire: on the one hand, being ostracized in Russia for their pacifist position and, on the other, being victims of both official sanctions and the “cancel culture” in the West.

Thirdly, the priority of the Kremlin at the moment is not the economy. Thus, the influence of the business and the economic flanks of the government seems minimal.

The Kremlin will have to face the economic consequences of Western sanctions, but that will occur when the military and political goals are deemed to be achieved.

Tommy Steiner Policy director of the Sino-Israel Global Network & Academic Leadership (SIGNAL)

Hard to tell.

The role of sanctions in ending the war depends on how they shape the calculus of President Vladimir Putin. If recent weeks have taught us anything, it is that speculating about Putin’s decisionmaking yields very limited results.

Nevertheless, the rapid, widespread, and growing sanctions regime, followed by an avalanche of global companies severing their operations in Russia, sends a critical message to Russia, China, and other authoritarian regimes: crossing Western red lines will exact a heavy price.

Authoritarian leaders tend to underestimate the resolve of democracies. That is why the Western response is such a powerful statement. It may not, in itself, stop the war in Ukraine, but it might well prompt authoritarian leaders to recalculate the pros and cons of challenging the West in the future.

Monika Sus Associate professor at the Polish Academy of Sciences

Only if Europe is ready to take it to the next level. And suffer.

The war triggered by Russia has shattered Europe’s security architecture. There will be no return to any cooperation with Moscow as long as it is led by President Putin and there are no signs that this will change.

Ukraine is fighting and doing everything it can to defend European values, so the EU must do absolutely everything in its power to help. And it must act quickly since thousands of people are suffering every day. This means that Europe must make the sanctions as severe as possible, as quickly as possible.

To do so, at their forthcoming summit in Paris, European leaders should take the sanctions to the next level and decide to stop importing gas and oil from Russia. This would no doubt be extremely costly for the EU, especially for the Central European countries that are highly dependent on Russian energy resources. But the EU must do this in order to have a chance at ending the war. And if EU member states act in a united manner and support one another, they will manage the costs and the energy supply problems.

Besides, the Kremlin is already threatening to stop gas supplies to Europe through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. Do we really want to be further bullied by an aggressor? Let’s start calling the shots, instead of waiting for someone else to do it for us.

Mirjana Tomić Journalist and project director at Presseclub Concordia, Vienna

In the summer of 1993, I spent a few days in Skopje, in what was then the Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. I was reporting for the Spanish daily, El País, on the United Nations embargo against Yugoslavia (Serbia). During breakfast at the hotel restaurant, I overheard conversations: some people discussed how to enforce sanctions, others how to boost import or export of goods, thereby violating the sanctions. One floor above the hotel restaurant, the UN had set up its office in charge of monitoring the UN embargo.

Two rounds of sanctions were declared against Serbia. They failed to end the wars, but the Serbian economy needed thirty years to reach its 1990 level.

I lived and worked as a journalist in a country under sanctions. We adapted. Austrian supermarket chains established outlets at the Hungarian-Serbian border and people travelled to buy and smuggle. There was no gasoline at the petrol stations, but one could purchase it in people’s backyards. International flights were banned, but direct bus lines connected Belgrade with Budapest airport. The population was getting poorer and the smugglers richer. The latter became respectable businessmen. The regime remained.

The Yugoslav wars involved a small territory. The war in Ukraine involves global players and interests. Institutions and companies seem to compete over who will enforce harsher sanctions. I doubt sanctions will stop the war. They will deepen poverty. The black market will generate new oligarchs.",https://carnegieeurope.eu/strategiceurope/86606

The sanctions introduced since the Russian invasion on 24 February are already far-reaching. Western countries have imposed a slew of financial restrictions, including freezing the assets of Russia’s central bank, limiting its ability to access its dollar reserves. The US, EU and UK have also banned people and businesses from dealing with Russia’s central bank, finance ministry and wealth fund.

Russian banks Bank Otkritie, Bank Rossiya, Novikombank, Promsvyazbank, Sovcombank, VEB and VTB will be removed from the Swift messaging system, which enables the transfer of money across borders. However, the ban stopped short of including those banks handling energy payments.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Kremlin-favoured oligarchs – including Igor Shuvalov and Alisher Usmanov – have also been sanctioned. Their assets in the US, EU, UK and Canada will be frozen and many have also been hit with a travel ban. The EU, UK, US and Canada have launched a transatlantic taskforce to find and freeze the assets of sanctioned individuals and companies.

There are also new restrictions on products that can be sent to Russia, including dual-use goods – those that can have both a civilian and military use – such as chemicals and lasers. Germany has put on hold permission for the €10bn Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to open between itself and Russia. The US, EU, UK and Canada have banned Russian flights from their airspace, and the EU has banned the sale of aircraft and equipment to Russian airlines.

On 8 March, the US and the UK also announced new energy sanctions against the Kremlin: the US said it would be banning all imports of Russian oil and gas, and the UK announced it would phase out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022.

The sanctions impact on the Ukraine conflict

The sanctions already put on the table are unprecedented in Russia’s post-Soviet history, closer to the restrictions imposed on Iran in recent decades – and they are already starting to take effect. The Russian stock exchange has effectively been frozen since the start of the war, and the ruble is down 30% against the dollar. Inflation is rampant, at around 9%, and cannot be effectively eased by the central bank, which needs to be very sparing with its reserves because of the sanctions imposed on it.



“Of all the sanctions, the ones that address the central bank’s strategic reserves are the most important,” says Maria Pastukhova, senior policy advisor for energy diplomacy at the environmental think tank E3G. “Of course, some parts are in other foreign currencies, some in gold, but the powers of the central bank to bolster the economy have still been severely curtailed.”

Although the sanctions specifically circumvent the Russian energy sector, it is already experiencing some painful side effects. The oil majors are pulling out, with BP, Shell, Equinor and Exxon Mobil having all announced plans to withdraw from shareholdings or joint projects in the country, and outside of the energy sector, a range of international investors have reached the same conclusions. The payments giants Visa and Mastercard have both announced they will withdraw their services from Russia, joining the likes of Apple, Airbnb, Boeing, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, Paypal, PwC, Spotify and TikTok in restricting their services in the country. “These will have long-term consequences for the Russian economy,” says Pastukhova.

Nonetheless, none of this will likely have much of an effect on the Kremlin’s immediate behaviour in Ukraine. Sanctions are designed to undermine the global competitiveness of an economy and its ability to grow further resources for aggression, and as such they can only be expected to work over time.

“Sanctions can only really have an impact long term, by destabilising internal politics, but will they act as a deterrent for Putin in Ukraine? No,"" says Pepi Bedi, a leading trade finance expert who has financed Russian energy supplies into Europe for over 27 years. ""As we saw in 2008 and 2014, he doesn’t care about the effects on the Russian people, and he has already factored in the economic costs.”

Russia has never been better prepared for sanctions as it is now. It has one of the world’s lowest debt-to-GDP ratios at 18% and has built up its strategic foreign currency reserves over the years to hit a record $630bn latest year. At the start of the Ukraine invasion, Russia was more robust than it was after it invaded Crimea in 2014.

“There is the ban on Swift, but if we are not targeting the energy sector because we are worried about the effects on Germany, Poland, Italy and so on, then what is that we are targeting with the Swift payments?"" says Bedi. ""In recent years, Russia has accelerated the use of its own payment cards, like MIR, and its own version of Swift, SPFS, so it is pretty immune by now.""

In the 2014 Crimea crisis, sanctions meant Western banks were restricted from funding large pre-export financings for Russian commodity players such as Rosneft and Gazprom Neft. However, those banks found a way around that by providing large ‘prepayment’ deals to commodity traders like Glencore and Vitol, who then on-lent the money into the Russian commodity sector. “People will always find ways around these sanctions,” says Bedi.

Bedi thinks that since 2014, Russia has learnt to live without Western finance. Before Crimea, the Russian economy was a large player globally, buying assets in the likes of South Africa, the US and Asia, but has since turned inward. The Russian government and companies have increasingly maintained their revenues within Russia, allowing them to be “prepared for losing access to the US dollar”, says Bedi. “Unless the European countries put in sanctions involving the euro, which is extremely unlikely given their dependence on Russian gas, the Kremlin won’t see a huge effect.”

The EU’s painful choices

However, in the wake of events, there has been a real turning point in the EU’s perception of its dependency on fossil fuel imports. Russia is now a symptom of a much bigger challenge of an overall dependency on oil and gas imports that are now increasingly seen not as a source of soft power, or as a bridge for cooperation, but as a major liability and a significant risk to the resilience of European energy systems.

That is now spurring action on multiple fronts in discussions over how to accelerate Europe’s energy transition. The EU is looking at what new technologies can help speed up the transition, as well as how to address the energy demand. “We have started to not just talk about supply, which is now entrenched in geopolitics and can’t be changed from today to tomorrow, but about how to address the issue by changing energy consumption,” says Pastukhova. “European countries are finally turning to the potential energy efficiency measures and new technologies in gas-dependent sectors, such as heat pumps for heating.”

However, there is also an opposing dynamic going on, where the pull away from Russian fossil fuel supplies is pushing demand for alternative supplies of fossil fuels from elsewhere. Plus, there is, of course, scepticism about the environmental sustainability of boosting LNG and coal imports to increase strategic energy reserves, particularly in the immediate aftermath of the COP26 climate conference in November. “So, we are at a crossroads,” says Pastukhova.

Nevertheless, the willingness of the EU to risk inflaming Europe’s current energy crisis by sanctioning Russian energy is undeniably growing as Russian forces employ increasingly barbaric tactics in Ukraine. The European Commission announced on 8 March that it aims to reduce EU demand for Russian gas by two-thirds by end of 2022, with the aim of achieving energy independence from Moscow ""well before 2030"" – but would banning Russia energy imports have any effect on Putin’s Ukraine offensive? Almost certainly not, agree Bedi and Pastukhova. Gas exports only contribute around 13% of Russia’s budget revenue, “meaning the sanctions on the foreign currency reserves of the central bank are a much more drastic measure than cutting off oil and gas supplies”, says Pastukhova.

EU countries are reliant on Russia for 40% of their gas supplies and cannot reduce that reliance quickly without resorting to measures such as demand destruction, including shutting down non-critical industry segments, or rationing heating and other gas-dependent activities.

​​

Europe imports around 400 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas each year, with Russia supplying around 175–200bcm. Can Europe find another 175–200 bcm in alternative gas supplies and/or reduced gas use? “Very tough,” says Nikos Tsafos, the James R Schlesinger Chair in Energy and Geopolitics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. He explained in a recent editorial that the shortfall would be almost impossible to make up either through increased LNG imports or by reducing internal demand.

The International Energy Agency’s recently published a 10-Point Plan to Reduce the EU’s Reliance on Russian Gas, claiming the bloc could cut Russian imports by more than a third within a year. “[But] remember that revenues from gas are a small part of the Russian foreign balance,” warns Tsafos. “Even if you hit all energy exports, Russia has enough non-energy exports to cover most of their import needs – before dipping into reserves. [So] you are not inflicting that much pain.”

Cutting off Russian oil supplies would be a more effective measure. The country is more sensitive to oil disruptions given that oil contributes around a quarter of the state’s revenue. So, the share of oil revenues in the Kremlin’s Ukraine war chest is significant. The EU could more easily find alternative supplies on the global oil market than alternative supplies of gas, given the market is much more liquid and is not tied by physical infrastructure such as gas pipelines.

However, cutting Russian oil supplies that cannot then be quickly rerouted to other markets would result in Russia essentially dropping out of the global oil market, which could have drastic repercussions. Russia produces and exports about 10% of global oil and a disruption of that scale in the global market would result not just in an exorbitant oil price – which already hit a 14-year high of $139 a barrel on Monday – but also have knock-on effects on vulnerable oil-dependent economies such as India.

“That might cause a level of geopolitical and economic turmoil that we have never experienced before,” warns Pastukhova. “The closest situation would be the oil crisis of 1973, but we really don’t have any proper comparisons. Targeting oil would be both effective and extremely painful [for the EU], so I don’t see that happening anytime soon. The only way the EU would be able to cut Russian oil supplies would be to try and reduce its oil consumption, which would take some time.”

All eyes are now on Brussels, as the world waits to see just how much pain the EU is willing to inflict on itself to punish Putin for his bloody campaign. The low-hanging fruit has already been picked – only difficult trade-offs remain.

Overview of United States sanctions on Russian persons (individuals, entities, and vessels).

U.S. businesses should be aware that the United States imposes sanctions on Russian persons (individuals, entities, and vessels) in response to conduct including Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea, invasion of eastern Ukraine, election interference, malicious cyber activities, human rights abuses, uses of chemical weapons, weapons proliferation, illicit trade with North Korea, and support to Syria and Venezuela. Further sanctions on Russian persons, entities, and ships involved in the Nord Stream 2 projects have been imposed, and additional measures are also under consideration, although the U.S. Government waived sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG, the company behind Russia’s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany, and its chief executive, in May 2021. While U.S. companies and individuals can lawfully engage in a broad range of business activities involving Russia that are not subject to sanction, penalties for violating U.S. sanctions can be severe. Therefore, American companies are advised to familiarize themselves with potentially applicable sanctions and to conduct thorough due diligence to ascertain whether a particular type of business activity or customers, clients, suppliers, or partners may be subject to sanctions.

The Consolidated Screening List can be a helpful tool for due diligence efforts. The Screening List is a web-based platform that consolidates eleven separate export screening lists of the Departments of Commerce, State, and the Treasury into a single list of parties for which the USG maintains sanctions and restrictions on certain exports, reexports, and transfers of items. Companies can search the list by entity name, country, and other criteria to help ascertain whether potential transaction parties might be subject to export restrictions or other sanctions. The U.S. Department of the Treasury maintains a Resource Center with comprehensive information regarding Russia-related sanctions, particularly those pertaining to Ukraine. Additional information resources can be found in the “Export Controls” section of this Country Commercial Guide.

Summary: Sanctions against Russian persons may include blocking of assets subject to U.S. jurisdiction; limits on access to the U.S. financial system, including limiting or prohibiting transactions involving U.S. individuals and businesses; and denial of entry into the United States. The United States also tightly controls exports to Russia’s energy and defense sectors. Following is a summary of current U.S. sanctions applied to Russia. A more complete overview of sanctions, periodically updated, is available from the Congressional Research Service.

Most of the current U.S. sanctions are in response to Russia’s 2014 invasion and annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region and Russia’s fostering of conflict in eastern Ukraine. The basis for Ukraine-related sanctions is a series of Executive Orders (EOs 13660, 13661, 13662, and 13685) that were issued in 2014 and codified by the Countering Russian Influence in Europe and Eurasia Act of 2017 (CRIEEA; P.L. 115-44, Title II; 22 U.S.C. 9501 et seq.), a part of the broader “Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act” (CAATSA). These Executive Orders provide for sanctions against those that the President determines have undermined Ukraine’s security and stability, misappropriated Ukrainian state assets, or conducted business, trade, or investment in occupied Crimea. They also provide for sanctions against any Russian government officials and those who offer them support, persons who operate in the Russian arms sector, and persons who operate in key sectors of the Russian economy.

Sectoral sanctions apply to specific entities in Russia’s financial, energy and defense sectors. U.S. persons are restricted from engaging in specific transactions with these entities. Restrictions apply to new equity investment and financing for entities in Russia’s financial sector; and new financing for identified entities in Russia’s energy and defense sectors. Sectoral sanctions also prohibit U.S. trade-related to the development of Russian deep-water, Arctic offshore, or shale projects that have the potential to produce oil and, as amended by CRIEEA, such projects worldwide in which those entities have an ownership interest of at least 33% or a majority of voting interests.

The United States revised CAATSA Section 232 guidance in July 2020, opening up the possibility of sanctions on entities facilitating the completion of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Several Russian entities and ships involved with the construction and pipelaying of Nord Stream 2 have been sanctioned, and the U.S. Congress continues to consider several proposals related to Nord Stream 2 with potential sanctions implications for Russian entities and their partners on the Nord Stream 2 and Turkstream projects.

In addition to Ukraine-related sanctions, the United States maintains certain sanctions in response to malicious cyber activities, under EO 13694, as amended by EO 13757 (and codified by CRIEEA). These measures target Russian individuals and entities that have engaged in cyberattacks against critical infrastructure, for financial or commercial gain, to significantly disrupt the availability of computers or networks, or to interfere with U.S. election processes and institutions. CRIEEA, at Section 224, enlarged the scope of cyber-related activities subject to sanctions to include a range of activities conducted on behalf of the Russian government that undermine “cybersecurity against any person, including a democratic institution, or government.”

The Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-208, Title IV; 22 U.S.C. 5811 note) requires the President to impose sanctions on persons he identifies (U.S. Sanctions on Russia: An Overview www.crs.gov | 7-5700) as having been involved in either a “criminal conspiracy” uncovered by Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky or his subsequent imprisonment and death. The act also requires the President to impose sanctions on those he finds have committed human rights abuses against individuals who are fighting to expose the illegal activity of Russian government officials or seeking internationally recognized human rights and freedoms.

The Support for the Sovereignty, Integrity, Democracy, and Economic Stability of Ukraine Act of 2014, as amended (SSIDES; P.L. 113-95; 22 U.S.C. 8901 et seq.), requires sanctions on those responsible for serious human rights abuses in “any territory forcibly occupied or otherwise controlled” by the Russian government. In November 2018, the Administration designated three persons for human rights abuses in Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine.

Use of a Chemical Weapon: In August 2018, the United States determined that Russia used a chemical weapon in violation of international law in the March 2018 nerve agent attack on a British citizen and his daughter. This finding triggered the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991 (CBW Act, P.L. 102-182, Title III; 22 U.S.C. 5601 et seq.). The CBW Act requires the President to terminate most foreign aid, arms sales, export licenses for controlled goods and services, and government-backed financial assistance. The second round of CBW sanctions, announced in August 2019, entails prohibition on U.S. banks’ participation in the primary market for non-ruble denominated bonds issued by Russia and lending to the Russian government/sovereign; U.S. opposition to the extension of any loan or financial or technical assistance to Russia by international financial institutions; and tightening of restrictions on the export of certain products subject to restrictions administered by the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security.

The United States also determined that Russia used a chemical weapon in an August 2020 attack on Alexei Navalny, again triggering the CBW Act and requiring the President to terminate most foreign aid, arms sales, export licenses for controlled goods and services, and government-backed financial assistance. The second round of CBW sanctions in response to the Navalny poisoning was announced in August 2021, as required by the law.

Weapons Proliferation: Several Russian defense-industry entities, including state-owned arms exporter Rosoboronexport, are denied most U.S. government contracts, export licenses, and trade in U.S. Munitions List-controlled items according to the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act, as amended (INKSNA, P.L. 106-178; 50 U.S.C. 1701 note). Other Russian entities are subject to sanctions under other legal authorities for providing certain goods or facilitating trade with North Korea or for their support to the Syrian government.",https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/russia-sanctions

Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland yesterday outlined U.S. and allied efforts to accelerate military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine in the face of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion, and plans to tighten sanctions further on Russia with the cooperation of countries around the world. Nuland testified in a hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, shortly after President Joe Biden announced that the United States would block oil imports from Russia, in addition to the sanctions already imposed since Russia’s onslaught began on Feb. 24.

Nuland and members of the committee expressed concern that conditions would continue to deteriorate in Ukraine. Committee Chairman Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) said, “I am afraid – and I hope I’m dead wrong – that this may be just the beginning of the fight for Ukraine’s existence…We are prepared to support the Ukrainian people. But it may be a long road. So while the response of the past 12 days is valiant, it cannot be the end.”

Menendez acknowledged that the Ukrainians are fighting for more than their own physical and national survival. “The fight for Ukraine is a fight for democracy. A fight for freedom.” Nuland said Putin is “testing the foundations of international law and he is testing us all,” and added that “Ukrainians are fighting for their nation’s survival, but they are also fighting for all of us.”

Senators urged the administration to speed the process of delivering the military aid Ukraine needs to shore up its defenses against Russia’s approximately 150,000 troops and their artillery, and to rush more humanitarian support for civilians fleeing either to other parts of the country or across borders. Congress is moving to provide additional funding as early as this week. Senators who oppose the administration’s negotiations to re-enter the Iran nuclear deal that President Donald Trump jettisoned expressed concern that Russia might benefit from any such arrangement. And several committee members said they opposed any plans to supplement U.S. energy supplies with oil from Venezuela.

Nuland said the administration is moving urgently to both provide the needed aid to Ukraine and ensure that sanctions against Russia exert maximum pressure on Putin from countries and economies around the world.

“From the U.S. perspective, the endgame is the strategic defeat of President Putin in this adventure,” Nuland said.

The following are among other highlights from the hearing:

On military assistance:

–Two-thirds of a new $350 million package of military aid that Biden and Blinken authorized 10 days ago has arrived in Ukraine, part of more than $1 billion in such assistance that the U.S. has provided for Ukraine to defend itself in the past year, Nuland said. The United States also is facilitating similar – and in some cases such as Germany unprecedented — assistance from others.

–Nuland said the administration was caught off guard by a Polish government announcement just before the hearing that it would provide 28 MIG-29 fighter jets to the United States for Ukraine to use in its defense. The two countries had been discussing the idea of Poland providing the jets directly to Ukraine, and the United States backfilling Poland’s supply of fighter aircraft with F-16s. Nuland said the Polish government had not consulted with the United States in advance of the announcement about the new sequencing. The Department of Defense rejected the Polish offer later in the day. As the Associated Press put it, the Polish arrangement “raised the concerning prospect of jets departing from a U.S. and NATO base to fly into airspace contested with Russia in the Ukraine war.” Nuland told the committee that Poland was a “natural partner” for Ukraine on the transfer of the Soviet-era fighter jets, including for training.

–Cardin urged that the Biden administration keep the committee apprised of any delays in getting critical fighter aircraft to the Ukrainian military, saying “We would like to see those planes there yesterday.” Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) noted that Slovakia also has 11 MIGs and Bulgaria has 13 that are being considered for transfer to Ukraine. Nuland said there are “a number of factors to consider here, and there are mixed views among allies and even within the administration.”

–The number of U.S. troops now in Europe and on its waters for reassurance to NATO allies has reached 100,000, Nuland said. (Most estimates had put the number prior to Russia’s onslaught at about 80,000.) The United States has more than doubled the number of forces it has in Poland.

–The Ukrainians have received “a large number” of counter-battery radars to defend against Russian missiles, Nuland said without going into detail, and the United States is considering other such assistance as well. She noted, however, that a system such as the U.S.-provided “Iron Dome” air-defense system that Israel uses against rockets from the Gaza Strip takes extensive time to set up, including training time.

–On the prospect of Kazakhstan possibly aiding Russia in its war against Ukraine, Nuland said that seems unlikely, especially after the recent incident in which Russian forces entered Kazakhstan, ostensibly to help suppress protests, but were essentially urged by the government to leave days later. Nuland said she thinks Putin will fail in any efforts to persuade the Kazakhs or other members of the Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organization to join in his war, though their dependence on Moscow puts them in difficult positions.

On humanitarian aid:

–The number of Ukrainians who have fled the country now exceeds 2 million, and the number who’ve fled their homes for other parts of Ukraine is at 1.2 million, and both numbers are rising. Senator Chris Coons (D-DE) said half the refugees are children, and that the exodus over 12 days exceeds that from Syria over three years. He said the United Nations is planning for 5 million refugees and 7 million Ukrainians displaced internally.

–The United States last week announced an additional $54 million in humanitarian aid for Ukraine, in addition to food, medicine, health care, shelter support and other assistance already in place. Nuland said the United States began stockpiling aid last year, when Putin began massing troops on Ukraine’s border and that it is sending more now.

–Senator Ben Cardin (D-MD) said he expects passage on March 10 or 11 of an omnibus bill with “major humanitarian assistance” for Ukraine. Coons said it may be as much as $12 billion, half of which would be “dedicated for the humanitarian crisis.”

–Nuland said yesterday was a “third day of disappointment” on implementing humanitarian corridors to get civilians out of combat zones and get food and medical supplies and other humanitarian aid in. United Nations agencies have been the main negotiators. Another effort was underway in Mariupol on Ukraine’s southern coast, but the Associated Press reported that the new attempt failed once more, severely endangering civilians.

On sanctions:

–Asked by Senator John Barrasso (R-WY) about Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s request to the British Parliament yesterday to designate Russia as a terrorist country and whether Russia is a state sponsor of terrorism, Nuland replied, “We have not put it that way before. But I have to tell you that every day that goes by that they commit these brutal acts on the ground, it’s something we should look at.”

–About 40 countries are participating in sanctions against Russia, constituting more than half the world’s economy. “We’re seeing a continued flight of capital, a tumbling of the ruble – it’s lost half its value, rising inflation, higher borrowing costs, and evaporating access for Russia to global financial markets. There is more on the way from the G-7, our EU partners and countries around the world if Putin doesn’t end this vicious war.”

–Menendez called for additional sanctions, including “every major bank” in Russia to be cut off from SWIFT, “holding Belarus and the Lukashenko regime to account for their role and acquiescence,” and “pressuring those countries who have not yet ended economic ties or arms sales [with Russia] to do so.”

–The Biden administration has now imposed similar sanctions on Belarus as it has enacted against Russia, based on the aid that the regime of Belarusian strongman Alexander Lukashenko has provided to Putin in the invasion, and Nuland said there are more sanctions to come against its leaders. At the same time, she said, Putin’s aim of getting military cooperation from the Belarusian military has not come to fruition, as Belarusian soldiers especially show a “lack of enthusiasm.”

–Committee members pressed for the Biden administration to have secondary sanctions ready to go in the event that certain countries help Russia skirt the penalties that the United States and its allies have imposed.

–Nuland said the U.S. and its allies are pressing China, which just reported its slowest economic growth in 15 years, to take the “opportunity for leadership” in not propping up Putin’s regime.

On the effect of the war on other countries of the region:

–Several members of the committee expressed concern that Putin, if successful in Ukraine, may try to expand his aggression to capture more of Georgia and Moldova than the enclaves he already controls there. Risch said, “I’m particularly concerned about the situation in Moldova, one of Europe’s poorest countries, which has one of the largest refugee populations per capita. It is struggling with high Russian imposed energy prices, and may have to deal with the activation of the 1,500 Russian troops in its occupied region of Transnistria.”

–Nuland noted the longstanding U.S. military cooperation with Georgia, whose troops, like those of Ukraine, served in the NATO mission in Afghanistan even though the country isn’t a member of the alliance. And she cited Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s visit over the weekend to Moldova “with the intent of offering support.” She noted the “short hop” from Odesa, a strategic Black Sea port that Russia inevitably will seek to wrest from Ukraine, to the Russian-controlled Transnistria enclave and then on to the rest of Moldova. She said Moldova’s leaders are concerned about both border security, having already received 230,000 refugees from Ukraine (120,000 of whom are staying), and energy security, as the country receives a large portion of its energy from Russia.

On Russia’s involvement in the talks over a possible return to the Iran deal (known as the JCPOA):

–Menendez, Ranking Member Senator Jim Risch (R-Idaho) and other members of the committee expressed concern that Russia, as one of the negotiating parties, might benefit from a return to the Iran deal, which the Biden administration has been negotiating for much of the past year, if the deal results in a lifting of sanctions on Iran that would allow it to buy oil from Russia. Risch advocated putting the Iran deal “on ice” for six months while the war in Ukraine is going on.

–Members also expressed concern about reports that Russia is seeking to leverage its role in the Iran talks to gain sanctions relief. Nuland agreed, saying, “Russia is trying to up the ante and broaden its demands with regard to the JCPOA, and we are not playing `Let’s Make a Deal’…There may be some in Russia seeking to get extra benefits for their cooperation and participation in seeking to get Iran back into the JCPOA, but they are not going to be successful.”

–At the same time, Nuland said, a delay in a deal to return to the JCPOA would be ill-advised. “The last thing we need is this war and an Iran with nuclear weapons.”

On U.S. Talks With Venezuela Over Oil Supplies

–Menendez, Risch, and other members expressed concern that the Biden administration may be discussing possible oil purchases from Venezuela to make up for the loss of Russian imports (see sanctions above). Global sanctions against Russia “should not be undercut by propping up a dictator under investigation for crimes against humanity in Caracas,” Menendez said. Risch echoed that appeal, saying, “We are in the enviable position of having the oil and gas reserves needed to increase production in our own country right under our own feet.”

–Nuland said the primary purpose of an administration visit to Caracas over the weekend was part of continuing efforts to gain the release of American oil executives being held there, though she did not foreclose the idea that discussions included energy supplies. With the U.S. ban on Russian oil imports, specifically heavy fuel that only a few countries produce, “you have to find a way to get more capacity.”

Other issues:

–In response to a question about reports that Ukraine may have biological or chemical weapons, Nuland said Ukraine has biological research facilities that the United States fears Russia “may be trying to gain control of.”

–In the March 2 vote in the U.N. General Assembly on a resolution to condemn Russia’s aggression, while the vast majority of 193 UNGA member states – 141 of them – supported the resolution, 35 abstained, including China. (Five voted against it: Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea, Russia, and Syria). Nuland said the United States and allies are trying to persuade China and other countries that “neutrality is not an option.”

–The United States is supporting “a large number of Russian independent journalists who are active” outside Russia and make use of networks such as the Telegram messaging app to convey truthful information back to Russians inside the country, where the government has clamped down yet further in recent days on freedom of the press and speech, including shuttering the last major independent television and radio stations.

–Nuland said the United States is developing an overarching strategy for the Black Sea region, including military, economic, and environmental issues. She suggested the U.S. government underestimated the effect of Putin’s control of the Crimean Peninsula there since 2014. “I think we have not taken appropriate account of what it meant when Putin seized Crimea and then began putting all kinds of advanced weaponry on it, and that gave him the capacity to close aspects of the Black Sea in a way that we cannot tolerate, and we need to get back to that business,” she said.

In addition to her oral remarks and answers to members’ questions, Nuland submitted written testimony, available here.

Summary Kremlin: West is engaging in 'hostile bacchanalia'

Kremlin says on energy: we are analysing the situation

Unclear how far turbulence will go on energy markets

Putin to discuss how to minimise sanctions

U.S. says: this is brutal war of aggression

LONDON, March 9 (Reuters) - The Kremlin accused the United States on Wednesday of declaring an economic war on Russia that was sowing mayhem through energy markets, and put Washington on notice it was considering its response to a ban on Russian oil and energy.

Russia's economy is facing the gravest crisis since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union after the West imposed heavy sanctions on almost the entire Russian financial and corporate system following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov cast the West's sanctions as a hostile act that had roiled global markets and he said it was unclear how far turbulence on global energy markets would go.

""You see the bacchanalia, the hostile bacchanalia, which the West has sown - and that of course makes the situation very difficult and forces us to think seriously,"" Peskov told reporters.

""We see that the situation on energy markets is developing rather turbulently - and we don't know how far that turbulence will go,"" Peskov said.

He declined to outline the exact nature of Russia's response. President Vladimir Putin, Russia's paramount leader since 1999, will hold a meeting with the government on Thursday to discuss minimising the impact of sanctions, the Kremlin said.

The West's attempt to cut off Russia - one of the world's biggest exporters of oil, gas and metals - has hit commodity markets and raised the spectre of spiralling inflation across the world.

Russian President Vladimir Putin says the ""special military operation"" is essential to ensure Russian security after the United States enlarged the NATO military alliance to Russia's borders and supported pro-Western leaders in Kyiv.

Ukraine says it is fighting for its existence and the United States, and its European and Asian allies have condemned the Russian invasion.

China, the world's second largest economy, has called for restraint but President Xi Jinping has cautioned that sanctions will slow down the world economy.

Asked about the Kremlin's comments, White House deputy national security adviser Daleep Singh said: ""This is brutal and needless war of aggression. We've said all along, if the aggression escalates, so will the costs.""

""I wouldn't call it an economic war. This is our way of demonstrating resolve,"" Singh said.

ENERGY POWER

Russia said on Monday that oil prices could shoot up to over $300 per barrel if the United States and European Union banned imports of crude from Russia. Brent hit $139 on Monday, its highest since 2008.

Russia says Europe consumes about 500 million tonnes of oil a year. Russia supplies around 30% of that, or 150 million tonnes, as well as 80 million tonnes of petrochemicals.

Asked about a ban on Russian oil and energy imports announced by U.S. President Joe Biden, Peskov said Russia had been, was and would be a reliable energy supplier.

Moscow would, though, now think very seriously about a response, Peskov said.

""The situation demands a rather deep analysis - those decisions announced by President Biden,"" Peskov said. ""If you are asking me what Russia is going to do - Russia is going to do what is necessary to defend its interests.""

""The United States definitely has declared economic war against Russia and is waging this war,"" he said.

The world needs to talk to Putin. There is no other way to stop this war.”

The United States should heed this plea. Ukraine’s resistance to Russia’s unprovoked and illegal invasion has been both heroic and effective, but its situation is precarious. For all their flaws, Russia’s armed forces may yet prevail in a prolonged conflict, and there is still a real danger that much of Ukraine will become a Russian vassal state under a puppet government. Moreover, even if Ukraine can hold off Russian forces indefinitely, the prospect of forcibly evicting them from its territory—particularly in the south—is daunting. All the while, Russia is slaughtering Ukraine’s citizens ever more indiscriminately.

James M. Acton Acton holds the Jessica T. Mathews Chair and is co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. More >

But as Zelensky’s statement suggests, Ukraine’s plan to end this war is probably not to vanquish the invading forces. Rather, its goal appears to be to make the prospect of continuing the war, and the occupation that could follow it, exceptionally painful for Russia—so painful that Putin comes to view a settlement agreement that preserves Ukraine’s independence as the lesser of two evils.

Putin may already be feeling the pain. The United States believes that Putin embarked on this war seeking to conquer most or all of Ukraine. Today, Moscow has implicitly recognized Zelensky’s government by demanding, in return for an end to the war, that Kyiv agree to Ukrainian neutrality, acknowledge Crimea as Russian territory, and recognize Donetsk and Lugansk as independent states. If Ukrainian forces continue to perform well, Putin will have to settle for still less and may even have to pay Ukraine reparations. (Conversely, if Russian forces achieve breakthroughs, Putin will be able to drive a harder bargain.)

Even in the best case, if Zelensky wants a negotiated settlement, he will likely have to make significant concessions to Russia—as he has acknowledged. Any such concessions will probably be bitterly opposed by many in the United States and Europe. Ultimately, though, it is not their call. The democratically elected government of Ukraine should get to decide what price it is willing to pay for an end to the slaughter of its citizens and the preservation of Ukraine’s existence as a sovereign state.

The United States and its allies should support Zelensky in any diplomatic course he pursues. Indeed, he cannot end the war without them. Economic sanctions on Russia strengthen his hand at the negotiating table by raising the costs to Russia of continuing to fight. By the same token, however, it is virtually inconceivable that Russia would agree to a settlement without sanctions relief. For this reason, the United States and its allies must be prepared to lift sanctions—including on Russia’s central bank—if Russia and Ukraine negotiate and implement a settlement agreement.

To date, the United States and its allies have sent out mixed messages about sanctions relief. U.S. Under Secretary of State Victoria Nuland indicated an openness to it. By contrast, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has declared “economic and financial war on Russia” with the goal of causing “the collapse of the Russian economy.” In a similar vein, British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss stated that “the purpose of the sanctions is to debilitate the Russian economy.” This ambiguity is dangerous because it risks obscuring the existence of an off-ramp for Putin and could thus prolong the conflict and increase the small but real chance of nuclear escalation.

U.S. President Joe Biden should clear up the confusion by stating publicly that the purpose of sanctions is to end the war, not to remove the government of Russia. In coordination with Kyiv, he should dispatch a trusted lieutenant—such as Secretary of State Antony Blinken or CIA Director William Burns—to try to negotiate with Russia. Washington and its allies could also explore whether they could address Russian security concerns, and vice versa, through the implementation of reciprocal arms control measures—as the United States and NATO proposed in January.

Success in this endeavor would be far from guaranteed, and the Biden administration would take heat for even trying. This criticism, however, could be undercut by Zelensky’s stating publicly that he would support sanctions relief for Russia in return for the implementation of any agreement he negotiated.

And what of Putin? Is he willing to negotiate?

This question is difficult to answer because if he is interested in negotiations, he has a clear incentive to downplay that interest right now. It is certainly possible that he will push on, regardless of any concessions that Zelensky might offer. Indeed, he informed French President Emmanuel Macron last week that the objectives of Russia’s invasion “will be fulfilled in any case.”

However, as everyone who has haggled over anything knows, you end up paying a higher price if you make it clear from the start that you’re desperate to buy. In this vein, Putin may be trying to extract greater concessions at the negotiating table by claiming that he has no interest in talking. Ultimately, it is impossible to know whether there is a deal to be had unless we try to get it.",https://carnegieendowment.org/2022/03/10/to-support-zelensky-united-states-needs-to-negotiate-with-putin-pub-86612
