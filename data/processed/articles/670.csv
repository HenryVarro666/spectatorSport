Alberto Pototschnig, Deputy Director of the Florence School of Regulation Energy and an economist with extensive experience in energy policy, regulation and market design issues, reacted to the news by answering a few questions and explaining what the move will entail.

How does an electricity system operate?

In simple terms, in order for an electricity system to operate, frequency should be maintained within narrow limits around its chosen nominal value (in Europe being 50 Herts, in the US 60 Hertz). Synchronisation of the systems throughout a region means that the systems in the whole region share the same frequency, which is supported by all the resources (generation and load) in the region. The wider the synchronous system, the more resources contribute to keep the frequency stable, the easier this is.

In which way were the electricity systems of Ukraine and Moldova operating before?

Until the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation army, most of Ukraine and Moldova were part of the Russian/Belorussian synchronous system (as the Baltic countries still are). In that respect, they relied on the much larger Russian system to maintain the frequency in Ukraine. With the de-synchronisation from the Russian system and the synchronisation to the Continental European system, now Ukraine can rely on the latter to keep its system stable.

What does the Synchronisation of the Continental European Electricity Grid entail?

As of today, Ukraine and Moldova can rely on Europe, rather than on Russia, to keep lights on. With this initiative, ENSTO-E (the European association for the cooperation of transmission system operators for electricity), the other European partners and the Transmission System Operators of Ukraine and Moldova managed to achieve in only two weeks what was planned over the next year.

Moldova and Ukraine have completed their synchronization process to the European electricity network ENTSO-E increasing their energy security amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

“The electricity grids of Ukraine and Moldova have been successfully synchronized with the Continental European Grid. It will help to keep their electricity system stable and lights on. It is a historic milestone for our relationship – in this area, Ukraine is now part of Europe!” the European Commissioner for Energy, Kadri Simson, tweeted on Wednesday.

Moldova and Ukraine withdrew from the Russian-led CIS energy system on February 24, when Russia invaded Ukraine.

Efforts to keep Ukraine’s energy systems running in the middle of a war have accelerated the process of connecting it to the European energy system, the European Network of Transmission System Operators, ENTSO-E.

Moldova’s Vice-Prime Minister Andrei Spinu called it a historic step for both countries regarding their energy security.

“Moldova and Ukraine have completed the process of synchronization with the European energy network ENTSO-E. It is a big step for the energy security of our country. So today, Moldova and Ukraine are part of Europe,” Spinu said.

The ENTSO-E represents 39 electricity transmission system operators from 35 countries across Europe, extending beyond EU borders.

Moldovan Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita and her Romanian counterpart, Nicolae Ciuca, discussed Moldova’s energy security and energy interconnection with Romania on Wednesday in Chisinau.

Talks took place in the context of Moldova and Ukraine completing synchronization with the ENTSO-E.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked the EU for helping Ukraine become a member of the Energy Union.

“The unification of the energy systems has been completed. Now electricity flows in and vice versa. Grateful to members, personally to Ursula Von der Lleyen, Kadri Simson and everyone, thanks to whom we now have a single energy system!” Zelensky said.

Moldovan energy expert Ion Munteanu said the interconnection with the EU energy system will save Moldova a good deal of cash. “It will save Moldova from investing in a back-to-back energy station estimated to cost over 200 million euros,” he said.

He added that energy integration provides more energy security. “For example, we could [before] only procure energy from Romania if we brought it through Ukraine from the border with Hungary. Real commercial opportunities may arise when the Vulcanesti-Chisinau and Balti-Suceava [power] lines are built with Romania,” he said.

The same expert said interconnection was vital to Ukraine in the current war conditions, allowing it to access secure energy sources even if its own generation capacity is shut down; Ukraine was hitherto dependent on electricity from Russia and Belarus.",https://balkaninsight.com/2022/03/17/moldova-ukraine-hail-connection-to-eu-energy-system/

In a press release, ENTSO E said the trial synchronisation of the Continental European Power System with the power systems of Ukraine and Moldova had begun today. “Continental Europe TSOs (Transmission System Operators) are now supporting the stability of the Ukrainian-Moldovan power system following a positive analysis which confirmed that an emergency synchronisation is technically feasible with a number of measures to ensure safe and secure power systems.”

“This is a significant milestone for the Continental Europe TSOs working in collaboration with Ukrenergo and Moldelectrica that are operating their respective power systems under extremely difficult circumstances.”

March 17 (UPI) -- Ukraine and Moldova have been successfully connected to the Continental European power system, officials said, paving the way for the two countries to permanently sever their power relationship with Russia. The European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity, also known as ENTSO-E, announced in a statement Wednesday that it had synchronized the power systems of the two former Soviet Union nations with the Continental European power system.

The establishment of the energy connection was made following the request of both nations and the completion of connection testing that has proved stable ""in spite of the extremely challenging circumstances caused by the Russian invasion,"" the Energy Community said.

According to officials, the move allows for the countries to make a permanent connection with the Europe power grid moving forward.

For Ukraine, it means the country will maintain a reliable source of power from Europe despite the destruction of energy infrastructure due to Russian attacks.

""This will help Ukraine to keep their electricity system stable, homes warm and lights on during these dark times,"" Europe's Commissioner for Energy Kadri Simson said in a statement, calling the connection with Ukraine ""a historic milestone"" for their relationship.

""In this area, Ukraine is now part of Europe,"" she said.

Ukraine and Moldova had been operating in isolated mode after the two severed their Soviet Union legacy connections with Russia on Feb. 24 when the Kremlin launched its war against Kyiv.

The Energy Community said earlier that the uninterrupted electricity supply to Ukraine is ""paramount"" for the safety of the European Union as continuous operation of the system must be ensured to maintain the safety of Ukraine's nuclear power plants.

""Moreoever, a blackout of the Ukrainian system would result in a blackout in Moldova too,"" it said late last month in a statement. ""Against these serious threats, the accelerated synchronization of Ukraine and Moldova seems to be the best way to prevent a possible blackout of their power systems due to prolonged armed conflict.""

Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, director of NPC Ukrenergo, Ukraine's transmission systems operator, said in a video message that the work engineers, politicians and diplomats did in three weeks to connect Ukraine to the European power grid would usually take a year and a half to complete.

""This is symbolic that the start of the war became the breaking point of the epoch,"" he said. ""Dark Soviet times are in the past and a bright European perspective is ahead.""

The country's high-voltage transmission system disconnected from the Russian and Belarus grids Feb. 24, but it will now link with continental Europe following an urgent request for emergency synchronization. Moldova, which borders Ukraine to the southwest, will also connect its power grid with Europe as part of the plan.

""Continental Europe [transmission system operators] are now supporting the stability of the Ukrainian-Moldovan power system following a positive analysis which confirmed that an emergency synchronization is technically feasible with a number of measures to ensure safe and secure power systems,"" the European Network of Transmission System Operators said in a March 16 statement.

The association of transmission system operators said the synchronization was made possible by studies carried out since 2017 and by the adoption of risk mitigation measures.

The group described it as a significant milestone for grid operators in Europe, working alongside Ukraine's Ukrenergo NPC SE and Moldova's Moldelectrica ""that are operating their respective power systems under extremely difficult circumstances.""

EU Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson said the news ""will help Ukraine to keep their electricity system stable, homes warm and lights on during these dark times.""

""It is also a historic milestone for the EU-Ukraine relationship — in this area, Ukraine is now part of Europe,"" Simson said in a statement. Ukraine is not a member of the EU, but President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a membership application during the early days of Russia's invasion.

""[Ukraine] has become a member of [the European] Energy Union,"" Zelenskyy said on Twitter March 16 about the synchronization of his country's grid with Europe. ""The unification of [Ukrainian and European] energy systems has been completed. Now [Ukrainian] electricity flows in [Europe] and vice versa.""

Ukrainian energy infrastructure, including electricity grids, gas compressor stations and distribution networks, has come under attack by Russia. In early March, Russian troops seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant after a night of shelling nearby.

The invasion poses a threat to nearly half of Ukraine's 9.5-GW installed renewable energy capacity, the Ukrainian Renewable Energy Association said March 10.
