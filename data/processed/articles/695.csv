Several MKs harshly criticized Zelensky for drawing comparisons between the Holocaust and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and seemingly ignoring some Ukrainians’ complicity in the Nazi-led genocide.

“I admire the Ukraine president and support the Ukrainian people in heart and deed, but the terrible history of the Holocaust cannot be rewritten,” Communications Minister Yoaz Hendel tweeted.

Hendel noted that part of Nazi Germany’s genocide of Jews “was also carried out on Ukrainian land.” He added that while “the war is terrible, the comparison to the horrors of the Holocaust and the Final Solution is outrageous.”

Hebrew media outlets quote unnamed senior ministers railing at Zelensky’s “outrageous comparison.”

“Zelensky also distorted the part his country played in the murder of Jews,” they said, according to the Ynet news site.

Beginning his speech to Knesset members, Zelensky said Ukraine and Israel face the same threat from their respective enemies — “the total destruction of our people, our state, our people, our state, our culture, even the name: Ukraine, Israel.”

Zelensky noted February 24 — the date of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — was also the date on which the National Socialist German Workers’ Party, the Nazi party, was founded in Germany in 1920. “It destroyed entire states and tried to carry out genocide.”

Again on February 24, “102 years after the Nazis, the order was given to begin the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has already killed thousands of people and left millions without a home,” he said. “They’ve become refugees… in dozens of countries.

Members of the opposition were even harsher than Hendel in their condemnation of Zelensky’s speech.

Likud MK Yuval Steinitz said it “borders on Holocaust denial.”

“War is always a terrible thing… but every comparison between a regular war, as difficult as it is, and the extermination of millions of Jews in gas chambers in the framework of the Final Solution is a complete distortion of history,” he said in a statement.

A number of Religious Zionism MKs also criticized Zelensky, with the far-right opposition party’s leader, Bezalel Smotrich, slamming the Holocaust comparisons and accusing the Ukrainian leader of trying “to rewrite history and erase the involvement of the Ukrainian people in the extermination of Jews.”

Religious Zionism MK Simcha Rotman rejected Zelensky’s request that Israel treat Ukrainians the same way Zelensky claimed Ukraine treated Jews during the Holocaust.

“I don’t understand Ukrainian, but if the translation I heard is accurate, Zelensky asked us to treat Ukrainians the same way they treated us 80 years ago. I’m sorry, but I think we will have to reject his request. After all, we are a moral nation. A light among nations,” he said.

Others, mainly from the coalition, were more forgiving of the Ukrainian president.

Foreign Minister Yair Lapid, who has condemned Russia a number of times since the invasion of Ukraine, was supportive of Zelensky and the Ukrainian people.

“I reiterate my condemnation of the attack on Ukraine and thank President Zelensky for sharing his feelings and the distress of the Ukrainian people with members of the Israeli Knesset and government,” Lapid said in a statement.

“We will continue to provide assistance to the Ukrainian people in any way that we can and will never turn our backs on the plight of people who have experienced the horrors of war,” he added.

Diaspora Minister Nachman Shai, a strong critic of Interior Minister Ayelet Shaked’s policies toward Ukrainian refugees, was even more supportive of Zelensky.

“Zelensky’s words pierce the heart. The Ukrainian nation was attacked, Ukrainian democracy was attacked, they are in great distress. We have the human, Jewish, and Israeli obligation to help them,” he said. “Our assistance on Ukraine’s borders and inside the country is impressive. We must also assure asylum for the refugees. We have done and will continue to do everything in our power.”

Yisrael Beytenu MK Eli Avidar, a maverick coalition member, called Zelensky’s speech “moving.”

“Indifference does kill,” said Avidar, referencing remarks made by Zelensky. “Mediation efforts are important but they can’t come at the expense of values. We need to be on the side of good against evil,” he said in a statement.

Blue and White MK Eitan Ginzburg said that Israelis should try and understand the Ukrainian president.

“I think that in this kind of situation, we mustn’t judge Zelensky. He’s in the midst of a unique situation. If we were in his shoes, we would be criticizing everyone the same way,” he told Ynet.

A Knesset spokesperson told Hebrew media after the speech that several cyberattacks attempting to disrupt Zelensky’s address had been identified and prevented by the Knesset’s cyber security unit.

According to Channel 12 news, 119 lawmakers attended the call out of a potential 140 (– the 120 MKs, and about 20 ministers who are not members of Knesset).",https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-lawmakers-tear-into-zelensky-for-holocaust-comparisons-in-knesset-speech/

Beginning his speech via Zoom to Knesset members, Zelensky said Ukraine and Israel face the same threat from their respective enemies — “the total destruction of our people, our state, our culture, even the name: Ukraine, Israel.”

Zelensky, who is Jewish, noted that February 24 — the date Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine — was also the date on which the National Socialist German Workers’ Party, the Nazi party, was founded in Germany in 1920. “It destroyed entire states and tried to carry out genocide,” he said.

On February 24, 2022, he said, “102 years after the Nazis, the order was given to begin the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has already killed thousands of people and left millions without homes. They’ve become refugees… in dozens of countries.

“Our people are now wandering the world, searching for a place, just as you once wandered… seeking security, trying to stay alive, and in peace. Exactly what you have sought,” said Zelensky.

“The Russian invasion of Ukraine is not a military operation as it’s presented in Moscow,” he added. “It is an all-out war, illegitimate, intended to destroy our people, our country, our cities, our culture and our children. Everything that makes Ukrainians Ukrainians.”

Zelensky then doubled down on the comparison with the Holocaust, which he has invoked repeatedly since the Russian invasion, at times drawing criticism from Jewish groups.

“The Russians use the terminology of the Nazi party, they want to destroy everything. The Nazis called this ‘the final solution to the Jewish question,’” he said. “And now… in Moscow… they’re using those words, ‘the final solution.’ But now it’s directed against us and the Ukrainian question.”

Zelensky noted a Russian missile attack that struck near the Babyn Yar Holocaust memorial in Ukraine’s capital Kyiv — “You know that there’s a memorial to the victims of the Holocaust and a Jewish cemetery there” — and said missiles have targeted Uman, “where tens of thousands of Israelis come each year to visit the grave of Rabbi Nachman.”

“What will remain of Ukraine’s cities after this war?” he asked.

(Zelensky’s speech below was delivered in Ukrainian, with Hebrew voiceover translation. The official Ukrainian Embassy translation of the text into English, which differs slightly from the Hebrew voiceover, is here.)

Zelensky then appealed to Israeli lawmakers for assistance and criticized them for failing to arm his country, refusing to take in large numbers of refugees, and opting out of many of the biting sanctions against Russia and its interests that have been imposed by the West.

“I’m sure you feel our pain, but can you explain why we’re still waiting… for your help… when other countries are giving help? Why isn’t Israeli help, or even entry permits, forthcoming?” he asked.

“What is it? Indifference? Political calculation? Mediation without choosing sides?” Zelensky added.

“I’ll leave you to provide the answers to these questions, but I want to point out that indifference kills. Calculations can be wrong. You can mediate between countries, but not between good and evil.”

Zelensky questioned specifically why Israel has not provided weapons to Ukraine nor imposed sanctions on Russia. He said that Israel’s Iron Dome rocket defense system is considered the best in the world — apparently referring to Israel’s unwillingness to supply it to Ukraine, as Zelensky had previously requested.

“You know how to defend your interests and help Ukraine. To defend Ukrainians. To protect the Jews of Ukraine,” he said. “We can ask many times why we’re not getting weapons from you, why Israel hasn’t imposed serious sanctions on Russia.

“You need to provide answers to these questions and live with them,” he said.

Ukrainians made their choice 80 years ago. We saved Jews and that’s why there are Righteous Gentiles among us,” added Zelensky, seemingly ignoring the complicity of some Ukrainians in the Nazi extermination plan.

“People of Israel, you too now have a choice,” he concluded.

Israel has long maintained good relations with both Ukraine and Russia, and has been seeking to use its unique position to broker an agreement between the two sides, as it tries to walk a tightrope maintaining its ties to both countries.

Ukraine has repeatedly pushed Israel for more support since Russia launched its invasion. But Israel has been seeking to avoid antagonizing Russia, which has a strong presence in Syria, where Israel carries out military action against Iran-linked groups.

There have been numerous apparent ups and downs in Kyiv’s relations with Jerusalem in recent days, with Ukraine at times lauding Israel’s diplomatic and humanitarian efforts and at other times strongly criticizing its reluctance to help more than it had done.

Israel’s relationship with Kyiv has also been strained by the fact that Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has avoided directly blaming Russia for the war, although Foreign Minister Yair Lapid has done so on several occasions.

Channel 12 news reported that 119 lawmakers participated in the online event — out of approximately 140, which includes all 120 MKs and ministers who are not members of parliament.

Zelensky’s speech was also broadcast at Tel Aviv’s Habima Square, where thousands of antiwar protests gathered to show their support.

“I reiterate my condemnation of the attack on Ukraine and thank President Zelensky for sharing his feelings and the plight of the Ukrainian people with members of the Knesset and the government,” he said in a tweet. “We will continue to assist the Ukrainian people as much as we can and we will never turn our backs to the plight of people who know the horrors of war.”

Zelensky had initially sought to give a more formal video address before the Knesset plenum, as he has done to other parliaments, but the request was denied by Knesset Speaker Mickey Levy, who explained that the Knesset would not be able to hold such a session while in recess without calling a special meeting.

Critics said Jerusalem’s decision was motivated by an unwillingness to be seen as siding too closely with Ukraine, while it seeks to maintain working ties with Russia and Bennett tries to mediate between Moscow and Kyiv.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-scathing-speech-zelensky-pleads-with-israel-to-prevent-russias-final-solution/

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

3,14c3e474-d30a-4a5d-862d-d0ae87a5a2a6,['Linda Gradstein'],,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is thanking Israel for its mediation efforts, but he had harsh words for the leadership when he addressed the Israeli lawmakers by videoconference Sunday, accusing the Jewish State of not doing enough to help Ukraine and comparing Russia’s assault to the Holocaust. The comparison is one many Israelis reject.

Looking tired and wearing his trademark army khaki T-shirt, President Zelenskyy spoke to the Israeli Knesset by Zoom for just under nine minutes. He repeatedly invoked the Holocaust.

The Ukrainian leader recalled how the Nazis did not want to leave any Jews alive, and how they called it the “Final Solution.” Zelenskyy said he knows Israelis will never forget that and he urged Israel to listen to how Moscow is also calling its invasion of Ukraine a final solution.

He went on to castigate Israel for not supplying arms to Ukraine, for not imposing sanctions on Russia, and for not accepting more Ukranian refugees.

It was the comparison to the Holocaust that sparked controversy here.

Dani Dayan, the chair of the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial Center, said Zelenskyy should apologize.

“Let’s make a clear differentiation between the Russian invasion, which is deplorable, and apparently there are a lot of actions taken by the Russian army that are apparently beyond the pale, and historical comparisons, the wrong historical equivalences that President Zelenskyy made, especially his reference to the final solution,” said Dayan.

Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett took a more moderate position, saying that while the comparison is not appropriate, he understands Zelenskyy’s pain. Bennett spoke at a ceremony Monday for an Israeli field hospital that is being set up in Ukraine.

He said, we are managing this unfortunate crisis with sensitivity, generosity and responsibility, while maintaining a balance between the various factors — and they are complex, Bennett said.

A day after his speech to the Knesset, Zelenskyy changed his tone dramatically. In his nightly video address, he thanked Israel and Prime Minister Bennett for its mediation efforts. He said he hoped that sooner or later, Ukraine will begin to have talks with Russia, possibly in Jerusalem.",https://www.voanews.com/a/israelis-reject-zelenskyy-s-holocaust-comparisons-/6494518.html

The March 20 speech by Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy before members of the Israeli Knesset provoked quite a lot of criticism from the Israel political echelon. Zelenskyy’s emphasis on the similarity of Ukraine’s suffering at the hands of the Russians to the extermination of Europe’s Jewry by the Nazis united many on the political left and right — in harsh condemnation of his analogy.

The memory of the 6 million Jews murdered by the Nazis binds Israel’s fractious society, which regards the Holocaust as a unique event without parallel in modern history. Reportedly, some Israeli experts advised Zelenskyy to limit comparisons to the Holocaust in his speech given the pervasive sensitivity of Israeli public opinion to commemoration of the Holocaust. Evidently, Zelenskyy did not adopt this advice.

While official Israel did not request Zelenskyy to limit his speech in any way, this advice was given to him for a reason. It was prompted by his previous utterances by Zelenskyy and some of his associates equating the horrors of the Russian invasion with the Holocaust in a bid to mobilize Israeli public opinion. Evidently, they believed such an approach would exert pressure on the Israeli government to provide Ukraine with defensive weapons and equipment. Zelenskyy and his associates assumed that appealing to the broadest Israeli common denominator — the memory of the Holocaust — would serve this goal.

Israel’s recent controversial decisions to limit the number of Ukrainian refugees prompted Ukraine’s Ambassador to Israel Yevgen Korniychuk to convene an angry news conference March 1 in a bid to mobilize Israeli public opinion. “We believe that you remember the times of World War II, when Ukrainians were saving the lives of Jews during the Holocaust,” he said. The ambassador rebuffed references on the part of some officials to illegal Ukrainian labor migration to Israel as an explanation of Israeli policy. “We’re talking about people who have family in Israel that could help them,” he said.

A Facebook post by the Ukrainian Embassy in Tel Aviv several days ago indicated the direction Zelenskyy had chosen for his Zoom address. “The Russian Nazis deliberately keep destroying synagogues and centers of Jewish culture across Ukraine,” it said. “What else should happen to make the Israel Government to help Ukraine with self-protection?”

The Ukrainian leader appears to have misunderstood the extent of opposition to such historic parallels and pulled out all the stops in berating the Israeli lawmakers and government ministers. “Listen to what the Kremlin says. Just listen! There are even terms that sounded then. And this is a tragedy. When the Nazi party raided Europe and wanted to destroy everything. Destroy everyone. Wanted to conquer the nations. And leave nothing from us, nothing from you. Even the name and the trace. They called it ‘the final solution to the Jewish issue.’ You remember that. And I’m sure you will never forget! But listen to what is sounding now in Moscow. Hear how these words are said again: ‘final solution.’ But already in relation, so to speak, to us, to the ‘Ukrainian issue.’”

Zelenskyy may have thought that the vicious assault on his country and ensuing deaths, destruction and displacement made him immune to criticism. He may have thought that as a Jew himself, he would be forgiven for invoking the most sensitive collective Jewish-Israeli memories. He may also have assumed that if Israeli politicians invoke the Holocaust to bolster Israeli public diplomacy, as former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeatedly did (and does from his perch as opposition leader) in his campaign against the nuclear agreement with Iran, he could do so as well. But even before he ended his 18-minute address, lawmakers let loose, at first hesitantly and off the record, but soon issuing furious public reactions.

Zelenskyy’s use of the term “final solution” was deemed particularly egregious. “I admire the Ukraine president and support the Ukrainian people in heart and deed, but the terrible history of the Holocaust cannot be rewritten,” Communications Minister Yoaz Hendel of the right-wing New Hope party tweeted.

“Zelenskyy’s speech was tough and thought provoking,” responded Labor Knesset member Gilad Kariv, chair of the Constitution, Law and Justice Committee. “The comparisons to the Holocaust should be dropped and instead the focus should be on a justified call for more significant action on the part of the State of Israel.”

The opposition was even more outspoken, attacking Zelenskyy outright. Former Likud party Minister Yuval Steinitz as good as accused him of Holocaust denial. ""It is said that a person should not be judged in times of distress, but had the speech of Zelenskyy, the Jewish president of Ukraine, been delivered on normal days, it would have been dismissed as borderline Holocaust denial,” he said.

The leader of the radical right Religious Zionism party, Knesset member Bezalel Smotrich, said that while he thought Zelenskyy's criticism of Israel was legitimate, as was his expectations of the state, the ""outrageous and unfounded comparison to the Holocaust and the attempt to rewrite history and erase the involvement of the Ukrainian people in the extermination of the Jews in it"" was not.

Another member of Smotrich’s party, Knesset member Simcha Rotman, also took the opportunity to settle historic scores with Ukrainians who collaborated with the Nazis in exterminating the Jews of Europe. “I don't speak Ukrainian, but if the translation I heard was accurate, Zelenskyy asked us to treat the Ukrainians like they treated us 80 years ago. Sorry, I think we'll have to decline his request. After all, we are a moral nation. Light unto the nations,"" he said.

Several hours after the speech, Zelenskyy apparently realized the damage he had wrought and sought to soften his criticism of Israel with a video message on Telegram. He thanked Prime Minister Naftali Bennett for the humanitarian aid Israel had provided to his people and for his attempts to mediate between Russia and Ukraine. “Of course, Israel has its interests, strategy to protect its citizens. We understand all of it. … Bennett is trying to find a way of holding talks, and we are grateful for this,” Zelenskyy said, adding that peace talks could perhaps be held in Jerusalem.

But his attempted apology came too late. Millions of Israelis had tuned in to his address, which was designed to awaken their sympathies and prompt pressure on their government to provide Ukraine with military aid and accept more refugees. It had the opposite effect. Zelenskyy, it seems, shot himself in the foot. He failed to arouse empathy even among those Israelis who have taken Ukraine’s side in the conflict and opened their hearts and pockets to help the refugees — even without comparisons of Ukraine’s plight to the Holocaust.",https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2022/03/israelis-taken-aback-zelenskyys-use-holocaust-victim-rhetoric

Several senior ministers, who spoke under condition of anonymity, said they were astounded by the speech, saying it was blunt and that the attacks on Israel were over the top.

Zelenskyy accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of trying to carry out a “final solution” against Ukraine – using the Nazi term for its planned genocide of 6 million Jews during World War II.

“You remember it and will never forget it for sure,” he said. “But you should hear what is coming from Moscow now, what words they are saying – ‘final solution.’ But this time it's about us, about the Ukrainian question.""

In evoking Ukrainians who saved Jews during the Holocaust, Zelensky elided the role of Ukrainian nationalist militia in carrying out the Holocaust and the rehabilitation of some of these same groups in recent years.

""I appreciate the Ukrainian President and support the Ukrainian people in spirit and in practice, but the terrible history of the Holocaust mustn't be rewritten. A genocide was committed also on the land of Ukraine. The war is terrible but the comparison to the horrors of the Holocaust and the final solution is enraging,"" Communications Minister Yoaz Hendel tweeted.

""President Zelenskyy's speech was difficult and thought-provoking.

""War is bad, difficult, and creates unnecessary victims and bloodshed,"" MK Yoav Kish (Likud) tweeted, ""it is not a holocaust. A holocaust is, among other things, intentional genocide, ovens, gas chambers, mass graves and the premeditated murder of women and children. The only word to describe the Holocaust is holocaust.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged Israel to do more to help Ukraine during a speech to Israeli lawmakers on Sunday, voicing his impatience with Israel as it mediates negotiations between Russia and Ukraine.

In a nine-minute live video address to the lawmakers, Zelenskyy said, ""You can mediate between countries, but not between evil and good.""

He asked why Israel won't give Ukraine weapons or impose sanctions on Russia, and criticized Israel's limitations on accepting non-Jewish Ukrainian refugees.

Zelensky, who is Jewish, invoked the Holocaust in his plea.

""Ukrainians made their choice,"" he said. ""Eighty years ago, we saved Jews,"" he said. ""The people of Israel, now you also have a choice.""

Zelenskyy's speech drew criticism from several Israeli lawmakers, mostly on the right wing, who said he overlooked the role some Ukrainians played in the Nazi genocide of Jews.

In response to the Ukrainian president's Holocaust reference, Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in a statement to NPR called it a ""trivialization and distortion of the historical facts of the Holocaust.""",https://www.npr.org/2022/03/20/1087782349/zelenskyy-ukraine-israel

(JTA) — In a searing 12-minute speech addressing the “people of Israel,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky likened the “final solution” the Nazis sought to impose on the Jews to Russia’s ambitions for Ukraine.

Zelensky also appealed, yet again, for military assistance and criticized the government of Prime Minister Naftali Bennett for trying to maintain relations with both Ukraine and Russia.

Zelensky, who is Jewish, acknowledged the sensitivity of Holocaust analogies in his speech Sunday but said they were apt in this case.

“The invasion of Russia into Ukraine is not just a military operation, as they present it in Moscow. This is a comprehensive and unjust war that is aimed at destroying our people, our country, our cities, our culture our children, everything that makes Ukrainians Ukrainian,” he said. “All the things that Russia is wickedly destroying while the world watches, so I can make this parallel, this comparison of our history to yours. … They didn’t want to leave any remnant of you and now they don’t want to leave any remnant of us.”

Zelensky said Russian claims that the war would provide Russia security were similar to Nazi claims that the removal of the Jewish people would ensure the security of Germany.

“They called this ‘the final solution to the Jewish question,’ you remember well, and I am sure you will never forget, but listen to what they are saying in Moscow, they are once again saying ‘the final solution,’ but now they are referring to us, to the idea of Ukraine,” he said.

He used the phrase “people of Israel” multiple times in the speech, which directly addressed members of the Knesset, most of whom logged in via Zoom, but was also broadcast live, including in downtown Tel Aviv, where crowds of supporters cheered and waved the flag of Ukraine.

“You have to answer these questions and afterward live with those answers,” he said. “Ukrainians made their choice 80 years ago, we saved Jews, and there are among us righteous gentiles. The people of Israel, you also now have a choice.”

Some Ukrainians sought to rescue Jews, but many others collaborated with the Nazis in seeking the extermination of the Jews. Ukrainian collaborators played a notable role at the Babyn Yar massacre site, where a Russian strike near the start of the current war gave Zelensky and his government grounds to appeal to Jewish sensibilities in seeking support for Ukraine.

Zelensky thanked Bennett’s government for its support of Ukraine at the outset of his speech; Israel has delivered humanitarian assistance to the country. But as he drew to a close, he excoriated Israel’s government for not making hard choices and called on it to deliver to Ukraine batteries of its Iron Dome anti-missile system and to allow in Ukrainian refugees.

He said he did not understand what the calculus was of the Israeli government, which has held back in forcefully condemning Russia and has resisted calls for more assistance, and which has claimed its relative neutrality could be useful in helping to broker an end to the war.

“What is this, apathy, calculation, or mediation without picking a side?” he said. “I leave the answers to you, but I want to emphasize, apathy kills, calculations can be wrong, one may mediate between countries but not between good and evil.”

Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid thanked Zelensky after the speech but suggested that assistance would come in the form of humanitarian aid and in allowing in greater number of Ukrainian refugees. Israel has so far agreed to allow in at least 25,000 Ukrainians who would not otherwise be eligible for citizenship.

“We will continue to assist the Ukrainian people as much as we can, and we will never turn our back on people who know the horrors of war,” Lapid said on Twitter.

Israel is wary of delivering military assistance to Ukraine because of the presence of the Russian military in neighboring Syria. Israel reportedly has received Russian green lights to strike Iranian targets in Syria.

The analogy to the Holocaust did not go down well among some Israelis, nor did Zeklensky’s bid to depict Ukraine’s Holocaust era record as one wholly of assistance to Jews.

“I appreciate the Ukrainian president, and I support the Ukrainian people in my heart and in my actions, but one cannot rewrite the terrible history of the Holocaust,” Israel’s communications minister, Yoaz Hendel, said in a tweet. “A genocide took place on Ukrainian soil. War is terrible, but comparisons to the Holocaust and the final solution are risible.”

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

In his remarks, the Ukrainian leader sought to draw a comparison between Russia and the Nazis, noting that the date of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — February 24 — was also the date on which the Nazi party was founded in Germany in 1920.

""Listen to the language the Kremlin uses, they use the terminology of the Nazi Party. They called it the 'final solution' to the Jewish question. You remember well, I'm sure, you'll never forget,"" he said.

""Now Moscow uses the words 'final solution' again regarding us, Ukraine. We see this on their official websites, there are quotes in the Russian media. This is what was said in Moscow. Without the war against Ukraine, they could not have secured the final solution to their security, just as was said 80 years ago.""

A senior government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, called the comparison ""outrageous"" and said that Zelensky ""misstated Ukraine's role in the murder of the Jews.""

Another government official, who also chose to remain anonymous, said that ""the Ukrainians slaughtered Jews, many Jews. There were also Righteous Among the Nations, but the majority slaughtered Jews. Don't he dare distort history.""

During World War Two, many Ukrainians had collaborated with the Nazis in their invasion of the Soviet Union and partook in some of the atrocities committed against Jewish people, most notably the Babi Yar massacre, in which over 33,000 Jews were systematically exterminated over the span of two days.

Communications Minister Yoaz Hendel said that while ""I appreciate the Ukrainian president and support the Ukrainian people in heart and action,"" Zelensky should not try to ""rewrite the horrible history of the Holocaust, a genocide that was carried out on Ukrainian soil.""

MK Mossi Raz of the coalition's Meretz Party said that he also ""did not like the comparison to the Holocaust"" and that the calamities that the Ukrainian people were going through were ""nothing like"" those experienced by Jews in the 1940s.

""It was a lapse of judgment on his part if he thought that would appeal to Israelis. That was the least powerful part of his speech in my view,"" he said.

Meanwhile, members of the opposition's right flank were even less apologetic in their criticism of Zelensky.

""It is said that a person should not be judged in times of distress, but had the speech of Zelensky, the Jewish president of Ukraine, been delivered on normal days, it would have been dismissed as borderline Holocaust denial,"" said MK Yuval Steinitz of the Likud Party.

Religious Zionist Party Chairman MK Bezalel Smotrich said that while he thought that Zelensky's criticism of Israel was legitimate, the ""outrageous and unfounded comparison to the Holocaust and the attempt to rewrite history and erase the involvement of the Ukrainian people in the extermination of the Jews in it"" was not.

Smotrich's fellow party member MK Simcha Rotman responded to Zelensky's remarks with a wry comment.

""I don't speak Ukrainian, but if the translation I heard was accurate, Zelensky asked us to treat the Ukrainians like they treated us 80 years ago. Sorry, I think we'll have to decline his request. After all, we are a moral nation. Light unto the nations,"" he said.

On the other side, Foreign Minister Yair Lapid, who has condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine on two separate occasions, thanked Zelensky for speaking before the Israeli parliament, without mentioning the Ukrainian president's Holocaust comments.

""I once again condemn the attack on Ukraine and thank President Zelensky for sharing his feelings and the plight of the Ukrainian people with members of the Knesset and the government,"" he said.

""We will continue to help the Ukrainian people as much as we can, and we will never turn our backs on the plight of people who go through the horrors of war.""",https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjn3nxbf5
