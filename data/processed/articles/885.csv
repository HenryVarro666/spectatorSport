The Stugna-P (Scythian), also known as Skif in export modification, is a Ukrainian anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) system developed by the Luch Design Bureau. Its guidance device is developed and manufactured by Belarusian design bureau Peleng based in Minsk. Stugna-P developed by Kyiv-based LUCH design bureau to destroy manpower and stationary and mobile modern armored targets with combined, carried, or monolithic armor including ERA (explosive reactive armor) and also pinpoint targets like weapon emplacements, lightly armored objects and hovered helicopters at any time of day or night.

Ka-52 Alligator is an all-weather attack helicopter operated by the Russian Air Force. Developed by Kamov Design Bureau (part of Russian Helicopters), Ka-52 is a twin-seat variant of the Ka-50 attack helicopter. The starboard side of the fuselage is fitted with a NPPU-80 movable gun mount installed with 2A42 30mm automatic gun. The six wing-mounted external hardpoints can be attached with different combinations of weapons. The hardpoints can carry VIKHR anti-tank guided missiles (ATGM), ATAKA missiles with laser guidance system and B8V-20 rocket launchers for 80mm unguided S-8 rockets. VIKHR anti-tank missile has a range of eight to ten kilometres. The first Ka-52 helicopter was rolled out in December 1996. The helicopter completed its first flight in June 1997. The serial production of Ka-52 began in 2008 at Progress Arsenyev Aviation plant in the Primorye region of Russia.

The Skif consists of a tripod, missile container, PDU-215 remote control panel, guidance device and thermal imager. The laser-guided system has a range of 5800 meters and can penetrate armor up to 1100 millimeters thickness. The PDU-215 control panel is a briefcase-like laptop with a control panel, containing a small joystick and a flat-screen display to assist the missile’s guidance. Two firing modes are available: manual, and fire-and-forget. Fire-and-forget provides automatic control of the missile flight using a targeting laser beam. The PDU-215 allows the control of the unit from up to 50 meters away (with a wire channel). A three to four-person team is optimal for deploying the Skif, operators require specially-made backpacks. Once the missile is fired, the operator controls the Skif and corrects the aim when necessary, by using the joystick on the remote control.

The system comes complete with 130mm and 152mm caliber missiles in transport and launching containers. 130mm missiles with RK-2S and RK-2OF warheads. Tandem charge HEAT RK-2S warheads might be able to counter medium weight main battle tanks such as the T-90A with penetration of 800mm behind ERA. RK-2M-K warheads might be able to counter heavy main battle tanks such as M1 Abrams with their penetration of 1100mm behind ERA. The system also includes HE-fragmentation RK-2OF and RK-2O-OF warheads to attack infantry positions and light armored vehicles. This or a very similar version is fielded in the Ukrainian armed forces as the Stugna-P. The system can use all four types of missiles without requiring modification. The system has a thermal imager for use during night operations.",https://militaryleak.com/2022/04/05/ukrainian-stugna-p-anti-tank-guided-missile-shoots-down-russian-ka-52-attack-helicopter/

Not only are Ukrainian MANPADS (Man Portable Air Defense Systems) a significant threat to the Russian Ka-52 and Mi-28 gunship helicopters operating over Ukraine but also ATGMs. The following clip has started to circulate online on social media on Apr. 5, 2022, and shows a Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) Alligator gunship shot down by a Ukrainian Stugna-P ATGM.

The video says it all: you can see the Ka-52 hovering at very low altitude over some trees, allowing the Ukrainian operator to aim and fire the deadly tank-booster missile at the helicopter. In a matter of a few seconds, the Russian gunship is hit by the missile.

Most of the videos we have seen emerging from Ukraine so far show the Russian Ka-52 carrying unguided rockets and Vikhr ATGMs.

Another batch of Ka-52 images, of note, it is not carrying a full load of 9K121 Vikhr ATGMs. Total capacity is 12, and it’s carrying 4. On the other hand, it seems to have a full complement of unguided S-8 rockets in a B-8V20A rocket pod. pic.twitter.com/57DAfXIKYm — OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) April 4, 2022

We have already explained how unguided rockets are fired at targets: the helicopters fly at low level then pull up into steep climb, and launch the rockets at the top of the parabolic arc of their flightpath, sending them downrange, then they break hard left and escape fast at low altitude. While fairly inaccurate, the tactic of lobbing rockets allows the helicopter to hit area targets from longer distance while remaining outside of man portable air defense systems’ kill zone. However, this has not always saved them, as the video of the Mi-28 reportedly shot down by a Starstreak missile few days ago proves.

Dealing with the ATGM, the 9K121 Vikhr (NATO reporting name: AT-16 Scallion) is a laser beam riding anti-tank missile. This kind of missile, uses a Line-Of-Sight Beam Riding (LOSBR) or beam guidance, meaning that it requires the helicopter to keep the target in constant Line Of Sight. In contested airspace or in areas infested by MANPADS, hovering at low level while keeping the beam pointing at the target, can be extremely dangerous. This is why, more modern stand-off weapons are obviously much more suitable for such scenarios.

Fire-and-forget capable weapons, like the AGM-114R Hellfire Block II when used in conjunction with the Longbow radar, or stand-off weapons, like Spike-NLOS, are a must have. Hovering within LOS or preforming unguided gun/rocket-runs in contested airspace can be fatal. pic.twitter.com/17YHvJDMdW — Kemal (@kemal_115) April 5, 2022

Dealing with the Ukrainian ATGM used in the above video, it is a Stugna-P. Designed in Ukraine and produced by the Luch Design Bureau, headquartered in Kyiv, the Stugna-P also known as “Skif” in the export version, is an anti-tank system with a maximum range of 5.5 km (daylight conditions). It consists of a tripod, missile container, PDU-215 remote control panel, guidance device and thermal image and is usually deployed with a team to three to four persons. Two firing modes are available: manual, and fire-and-forget. Fire-and-forget provides automatic control of the missile flight using a targeting laser beam. Once the missile is fired, the operator can use a targeting reticle and joystick to correct the aim and steer the missile.

Interestingly, the PDU-215 allows the control of the unit from up to 50 meters away: this means that the team can set up the launcher on its tripod in a specific launch position and remotely control it from cover using a control system connected to the launcher by long cable.",https://theaviationist.com/2022/04/05/ka-52-shot-down-atgm/

I won't share the video of the shot here, because although it was a very impressive shot, I don't think we're allowed to link back to content where people died.
