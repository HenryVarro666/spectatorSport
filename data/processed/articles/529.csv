According to the biologists, documents presented to the public last week by Russia’s defense ministry as supposed evidence of covert “bioweapons labs” under Pentagon control in Ukraine actually describe relatively harmless collections of pathogens used for public health research. The comprehensive review of the documents by experts who understand both the science and the Cyrillic alphabet took on new importance on Wednesday, as President Vladimir Putin cited the imaginary threat of weapons of mass destruction near Russia’s borders as a justification for the invasion of Ukraine.

Before the recent crackdown on independent media outlets in Russia, these outlandish claims from Russian defense officials — which were amplified on the global stage by Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, and its U.N. ambassador, Vasily Nebenzya — might have been undercut by interviews with Russian biologists who called the underlying evidence for the allegations transparently false. But because dissenting views have been repressed, and independent broadcasters shut down, Russian scientists have been forced to post their findings on social networks that are mainly blocked in Russia.

“The list contains only strains common to microbiological and even more so to epidemiological laboratories.”

The first Russian biologist to make his analysis of the evidence widely known was Eugene Lewitin, who holds advanced degrees in biology from Moscow State University and GosNIIgenetika, a biotechnology research institute. The documents from Ukraine, Lewitin wrote in an open letter posted on Facebook and Change.org, do “not imply any development of biological weapons or even the use of particularly dangerous pathogens in the laboratories. The list of destroyed strains published by RIA Novosti and other Russian media outlets contains not a single particularly dangerous strain. The list contains only strains common to microbiological and even more so to epidemiological laboratories.” More than 800 signatories endorsed Lewitin’s letter when it was transformed into a petition from Russian biologists urging Russian journalists to stop repeating the government’s “false, absolutely groundless and hatred-inciting statements about allegedly found evidence of the development of biological weapons in Ukrainian laboratories.”

The first set of Ukrainian documents to be made public by the Russian military were published by the Russian government news agency RIA Novosti on March 6. Those documents were orders from Ukraine’s health minister, issued on the second day of the Russian invasion, directing labs in two cities, Kharkiv and Poltava, to destroy collections of bacterial pathogens used for research. Given the subsequent Russian shelling of Kharkiv, the Ukrainian effort to ensure that an attack on the lab there could not cause the accidental release of bacteria seems prudent. But Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, the Russian defense ministry spokesperson, told the state news agency that the attempt to secure the labs was itself evidence that Ukrainian and American scientists had been secretly plotting to weaponize dangerous pathogens. The destruction of the pathogens listed on orders sent to the labs, Konashenkov said, was a desperate effort “to conceal any traces of the military-biological program financed by the U.S. Department of Defense in Ukraine.” At a defense ministry briefing in Moscow the next day, Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov — the head of the Russian military’s radiation, chemical, and biological protection force — displayed these documents on a huge screen. The only possible explanation for “why the samples were disposed of in such haste,” Kirillov insisted, must have been to prevent Russian experts from discovering “that synthetic biology methods were being tested there to enhance the microorganisms’ pathogenic properties.”

Kirillov also stated, without evidence, that a swine flu outbreak in 2007 and increased cases of measles, rubella, diphtheria, and tuberculosis in Ukraine had somehow been caused by biological research at U.S.-funded labs in Ukraine and the former Soviet republic of Georgia. At a second briefing three days later, he claimed that documents on public health projects to detect and monitor animal diseases in Ukraine — including coronaviruses in bats, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever and hantavirus in ticks and rodents, and avian flu in ducks that migrate from Ukraine to Russia — were proof of a sinister plot to send infected animals to Russia. He even speculated that a document showing that researchers in Ukraine had sent blood samples to labs in Australia was proof of a secret Pentagon effort to study “Slavic DNA,” in order to construct a biological weapon that would infect only ethnic Russians.

Kirillov also claimed that in a joint Ukrainian-American project called R-781, “bats are considered as carriers of potential biological weapons agents.” However, the document describing that project, which was projected on the big screen behind the general, just outlined a proposal for an expert from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta to collaborate with a veterinary medicine specialist in Kharkiv and a researcher in Tbilisi on routine disease surveillance of bats in Ukraine and Georgia, including testing for bacterial and viral infections (such as coronaviruses) and performing genomic sequencing. The proposal had nothing to do with biological weapons research, and the CDC told The Intercept that the project did not receive funding and never even began. Some of the documents cast by Kirillov as evidence of biological weapons research actually concerned the Ukrainian health ministry’s cooperation with German experts from BNITM, the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg, to improve surveillance and diagnosis of diseases like dengue fever and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. In a statement sent to The Intercept, the institute rejected the Russian claims. “The BNITM has never and will never work directly or indirectly on bio weapons,” the statement said. For the past six years, the BNITM has instead been working with public health officials in Ukraine to investigate “seroprevalence, the existence of antibodies, on various infectious diseases occurring in this region. The aim of the project is and was to enable the country to do diagnoses on antibodies itself.” The institute added that its project is part of the German government’s effort to improve global biosecurity through the “minimization of biological risks emanating from highly hazardous pathogens in 25 countries.” Konashenkov, the defense ministry spokesperson, also claimed that the documents from Ukraine showed that “certain experiments were carried out with samples of coronavirus in bats. The goal of this and other Pentagon-funded biological studies in Ukraine was the creation of a mechanism for the covert spread of deadly pathogens.”

On March 10, Russian defense ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov claimed, falsely, that documents seized in Ukraine indicated that U.S. and Ukrainian researchers were plotting to use birds to covertly send deadly pathogens to Russia pic.twitter.com/83nNA897kc — Robert Mackey (@RobertMackey) March 17, 2022

Konashenkov additionally stated as a matter of fact something for which none of the documents presented at the briefing backs up: that American-financed studies of bird, bat, and reptile pathogens planned for later this year would include experiments on the ability of the animals to be used to covertly transmit weaponized African swine fever and anthrax. When Russian news outlets repeated these claims, Lewitin, the veteran Russian biologist, wrote that they had been duped into printing what he called “deliberately false information,” fed to them by the military, about what was in the documents. Even reporters for state-run outlets, Lewitin said, have a duty to study what the state calls proof and consult experts to make sure official claims about science are accurate. By way of example, Lewitin, who has a Ph.D. in genetics, pointed to “the absolutely wild idea of the existence of special ‘DNA of the Slavs,’” which could be used to target ethnic Russians with a biological weapon. That, he said, “is nonsense” that echoes “German Nazi propaganda.”

Lewitin offered a more detailed debunking of the evidence in an interview with Marina Aronova, a correspondent for Siberia.Realities, a regional news outlet of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, which is funded by the U.S. government. Lewitin explained that all of the bacterial strains mentioned in the documents were the kind of samples found in any public health lab or epidemiological institute. The paperwork even indicated that some of the strains had been purchased from Russian labs. The Russian military, Lewitin told Aronova, had simply lied about what the Ukrainian documents meant. “Let me explain with a simple example,” he said. “Imagine you come to a certain office and see an inscription on one of the rooms: ‘Instruction for the cleaner. Two times a day to wet clean the room.’ From this you conclude that in this room Ukrainian nationalists dismember people alive twice a day and sacrifice them to Cthulhu, and then cover up the traces. The statement of the official representative of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, Igor Konashenkov, in combination with the documents attached to this statement, produces just such an impression.” “That’s how propaganda works,” he added. “The Ministry of Defense made a false, unfounded statement — and now, if I talk to people, 90 percent of them will say: ‘Bioweapons were made in Ukraine.’ No one has read the attached documents. And those who have read it will say: ‘Well, yes, maybe there are no dangerous pathogens in these documents. But they don’t tell us about it for nothing. Maybe there are dangerous strains in other documents that cannot be published openly.’” When I asked Lewitin in an online chat this week what he made of the other documents, on research projects involving American experts from the CDC and USDA, he replied: “I would say that this is a hash of scattered information with no relevance to the subject [of] bioweapons. These are invitations to workshops and accompanying material, lists of instructions on biosafety, lists of completely innocent strains [of pathogens], many of them received from Russian collections.” As for “the stuff on avian and bat migration investigations,” routine research on strains of flu and other viruses in the wild population that could jump to humans, Lewitin told me he couldn’t comprehend it any other way than as “a complete delirium.” A parallel effort to evaluate the first set of documents presented as proof of biological weapons research at the labs in Kharkiv and Poltava was conducted by a group of nine Russian-speaking biologists based in Russia, Belarus, Sweden, and France that was published on Twitter in Russian by Olga V. Pettersson, an “ex-pat Soviet” expert in genome sequencing. (Most of that long thread was translated into English by Ilya Lozovsky, an editor at the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project.) Pettersson and her colleagues converted the screenshots of the original documents ordering the destruction of pathogens at the labs published in the Russia media into a Google Docs spreadsheet that is easier to read and pointed out that, despite claims from the Russian military, there are “no deadly pathogens on this list – no plague, anthrax, cholera.” In their detailed debunking of the Russian claims, the researchers explained that any effort to create biological weapons would require “a much larger base of strains than those listed.” The documents indicate that “the Kharkiv lab destroyed only 40 test tubes and the Poltava lab destroyed 24.” The group also agreed with Lewitin’s conclusion that creating “a ‘military’ bacterium specific only for a certain nationality and especially for Russians is absolutely evolutionarily impossible.” In conclusion, the researchers said, the statements published in the Russian state media, and attributed to senior Russian officials, “are unsubstantiated anti-scientific bullshit.” “We thank Russian biologists for not being afraid to tell the truth,” Serhiy Leshchenko, a Ukrainian investigative journalist and an adviser to the Ukrainian president’s office, said in a statement on YouTube from embattled Kyiv. “This fake narrative is unfortunately circulating very widely.” In an interview, Pettersson told me that while she had faced a torrent of online harassment because the collaborative research thread was posted on her Twitter account, she was most concerned for the safety of her colleagues in Russia and Belarus who had helped debunk the Russian government’s claims despite living in countries where such criticism could bring severe consequences. She also pointed out that she receives no U.S. funding for her research on genomic sequencing. Asked why she thought the Russian officials expected to get away with so inaccurately describing the contents of the documents they made public, Pettersson suggested that they might have guessed many Russians would not look too closely at the lists of bacterial strains used in the Ukrainian labs because they were all written in Latin. Whatever their expectations , it is beyond doubt that the Russian government has succeeded in generating a global media frenzy of speculative commentary on the supposed existence of “bioweapons labs” in Ukraine — despite the fact that the documents they have pointed to as evidence offer no support for the allegations. The Russian government’s claim that the biological labs funded by the U.S. were experimenting with dangerous pathogens, though debunked by the Russian biologists, was echoed by influential voices on Fox News like Tucker Carlson and Tulsi Gabbard. For instance, after Victoria Nuland, a State Department official, said that the U.S. was working with Ukraine to prevent “biological research materials” in Ukrainian labs from being seized by Russian forces, Carlson and Gabbard amplified the false claim made by the Russian military that the routine public health research in those labs was dangerous. Carlson distorted Nuland’s statement into an admission that, in his words, “Ukraine has secret bio labs” and that falsely asserted that “Nuland said whatever they’re doing in those labs is so dangerous and so scary that she is ‘quite concerned’ that the so-called research material inside those bio labs might fall into the hands of Russian forces.” Carlson’s claims about what Nuland said were quickly translated into Russian by the state broadcaster in Moscow and shared on Twitter by Russian diplomats.

The Fox host, whose commentaries have become a staple of Russian state TV, also claimed, wrongly, that Nuland had “all but said … that there’s a military application to this research, that they were working on bioweapons.” Carlson then took the bait offered by the Russian military’s reference to coronavirus to make the wild claim that the mundane public health research in Ukraine was identical to dangerous experiments on bat coronaviruses in Wuhan, China, funded by the U.S. before the Covid-19 pandemic.

Tucker Carlson took the bait offered by the Russian military’s reference to coronavirus.

On March 13, Gabbard tweeted a video viewed nearly 3 million times, in which she falsely claimed that the public health labs were “conducting research on dangerous pathogens” and were engaged in that she called “dangerous research, including gain of function, similar to the lab in Wuhan where Covid-19 may have originated from.” While the unfunded CDC proposal to monitor diseases in bats in Ukraine and Georgia obtained by the Russian military mentioned surveillance of diseases, including coronaviruses, the idea that any viral strains obtained by the researchers would be manipulated in gain-of-function research was wholly invented by the Russian military, Carlson, and Gabbard. When Gabbard was criticized for saying things about the type of work done in the labs for which there is no evidence, Carlson defended her in a statement that echoed the false claims made by Russian officials. “Unsecured bioweapons in a war zone are a bad idea,” Carlson told his millions of viewers this week. Away from television screens, the unfounded Russian allegations were echoed by the Chinese foreign ministry’s spokesman, Zhao Lijian, and amplified in a conspiratorial Infowars video that was viewed more than 650,000 times. Last week, both the Chinese statement and the Infowars video were promoted on Facebook as paid advertisements. Russian officials have repeatedly invoked the fact that the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003 on the false pretext that the country had weapons of mass destruction — including “mobile biological research laboratories” — as a reason to distrust the Americans now. When Russia’s U.N. ambassador, Vasily Nebenzya, presented those false claims to the Security Council last week, he scoffed at American denials by mentioning that the diplomats were in the very same room where, in 2003, Colin Powell had held up “that famous test tube” during his presentation of faulty intelligence on Iraq’s suspected weapons of mass destruction. Moments later, Nebenzya did something of an accidental homage to Powell, by holding up images of pregnant women who were injured in the shelling of a maternity hospital in Mariupol by Russian forces and repeating the thoroughly debunked claim that the photographs had been staged.

All this suggests that the real lesson Russian officials took from the false American claims of WMD in Iraq is not that such claims need to be backed by solid evidence, but that they can make similarly false claims now, secure in the knowledge that very few people will bother to look at the evidence at all. The Russian strategy , of loudly making claims about biological weapons research and pointing to documents that do not, in any way, confirm that to be true has been employed multiple times in recent years. In 2018, when Russia faced international condemnation for trying to kill the former spy Sergei Skripal with a nerve agent, Russian state television suddenly revived conspiratorial claims that a U.S.-funded lab in Georgia was testing biological weapons on the Georgian people. In that case too, documents supposedly proving the allegations were published in the state media — records from the lab which showed that dozens of Georgians had died in 2015 while taking the American-made drug Sovaldi. Those records were obtained and made public by a former head of Georgian intelligence living in exile in Russia, Igor Giorgadze. Maria Zakharova, the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, said that the documents made public by Giorgadze “again raise questions about the U.S. military’s true aims and objectives in Georgia.” The documents Giorgadze publicized were described as a bombshell on Russian state television, in a report that quoted a former Russian military biologist speculating that Georgians were being used as guinea pigs in biological weapons experiments.

Soon after the broadcast, the same documents were also presented to the Russian public on the big screen at a defense ministry briefing led by Konashenkov and Kirillov. The death records, Kirillov claimed, gave Russian experts, “reason to believe that a highly toxic chemical drug or a highly lethal biological agent was [administered] under the guise of medical treatment” at the U.S.-funded Lugar Research Center in Tbilisi. The documents, and the Russian claims that public health research in the lab in Georgia was a cover for sinister activities, was amplified at the time by Chinese state media.

A report on the briefing from the Russian government news agency Tass included this conspiratorial aside about Sovaldi, which is used to treat chronic hepatitis C infections: “Kirillov noted that the U.S.-based Gilead Sciences, in which former U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld is a key shareholder, manufactured the drug.” Russian officials, and state-controlled Russian television, repeated the allegations again and again throughout 2018.

By the following year, the idea that the U.S. operated biological weapons labs on Russia’s borders was treated as an undeniable fact on Russian talk shows.

But a closer look at the records from the lab in Georgia reveals that there was nothing suspicious about the deaths reported in 2015, as Russian officials had claimed. To start with, these were not clinical trials of Sovaldi in Georgia in 2015. The drug had already been approved by the FDA in 2013. The safe and effective drug was being administered to Georgians for free as part of an effort to eliminate hepatitis C from Georgia, and the project was overseen by the CDC with donated drugs from Gilead. In the first two years of the program, more than 90 percent of the first 30,000 patients to be treated were cured of the illness. When the project started, Eurasianet reported, Sovaldi “was administered to 5,800 Georgian hepatitis patients with severe complications like advanced liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.” Because the first patients to get the drug were the sickest, it is not surprising that dozens of them died before the drug could clear the virus from their system. Georgia also invited international experts to examine the lab in person in November, 2018. Filippa Lentzos, a biologist and a scholar at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies reported in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists that year that she had been part of a group of international experts that visited the lab in Tbilisi. “We were given access to all areas of the site, examined relevant documentation, and interviewed staff, and concluded that the Center demonstrates significant transparency,” Lentzos reported in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists. “Our group observed nothing out of the ordinary, or that we wouldn’t expect to see in a legitimate facility of this sort.” When Steve Rosenberg of the BBC put it to Zakharova in late 2018 that there was no evidence in the documents tracking the Sovaldi project that any biological weapons experiments on humans had been performed in the U.S.-funded lab, the Russian diplomat unwittingly echoed Donald Rumsfeld’s infamous remarks in 2002 on the lack of evidence for Iraqi WMD, in her reply. “You know, if there’s no evidence right now, that doesn’t mean that no evidence exists,” Zakharova said. Put another way, what this senior Russian diplomat said in 2018 holds true today: Russia will not be deterred by a lack of evidence from claiming that the U.S. operated biological weapons labs in former Soviet states on its borders. Another Russian expat amazed by the Russian claims is Michael Favorov, who immigrated to the U.S. from the Soviet Union three decades ago, after a long career in public health and epidemiology, and then oversaw CDC programs in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. In a phone call this week, Favorov told me that he suspects some of the Russian military’s wild ideas about what is happening in U.S.-funded labs in former Soviet countries is likely projection. Favorov recalled that there was pressure on Soviet scientists to look for potential military applications for their research. He didn’t take part, but some of his contemporaries did. The accidental release of anthrax in 1979 from a Soviet military research facility in Yekaterinburg, which was known as Sverdlovsk in Soviet times, killed at least 66 people. Soviet officials, including Boris Yeltsin, lied about what caused the outbreak until 1992. And weapons developed in secret Soviet labs are still used to poison Russian dissidents and defectors. The anti-corruption activist Alexey Navalny survived an attempted assassination with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok in Russia in 2020. Two years earlier, the same nerve agent had been used in a botched attempt to murder Skripal in England. Western officials and open-source researchers offered convincing evidence that both attempted murders were carried out by Russian intelligence agents. Favorov told me that older, Soviet-trained military biologists probably assume that the U.S. is still doing that sort of work. The fact that the Pentagon has provided much of the funding for labs built by the United States in former Soviet states also fuels suspicion in Russia, and elsewhere. Asked why the Pentagon provided the money — beyond the obvious fact that the Department of Defense is the one part of the U.S. government that is lavishly funded — Favorov said that the Pentagon took the lead in the effort to upgrade biosecurity in those countries partly in response to the anthrax attacks in the U.S. that started just a week after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York and Washington. Five people died from inhaling anthrax and 17 others were infected after exposure in the following months, as envelopes stuffed with spores were mailed to U.S. officials and journalists. That quickly made it a priority for the U.S. to help secure dangerous pathogens, particularly in some of the impoverished former Soviet states where anthrax is naturally occurring but had also been used in biological weapons experiments before the collapse of the USSR in 1991. After the Soviet Union was dissolved, Favorov said, most of the former Soviet states outside Russia were in dire need of better laboratories to perform modern disease surveillance and research, and to safely store strains of deadly endemic diseases known as special pathogens that they needed to study and describe to protect their populations from outbreaks. So the Pentagon-funded projects, Favorov said, were “focused on how to identify pathogens, how to introduce biosafety to all these labs which were working with these pathogens anyway.” In many cases,” Favorov added, “I believe that Russians were kind of jealous that, you know, somebody’s helping their used-to-be Russian colonies to organize better laboratories.” Favorov, who was a well-known Soviet scientist, used his old connections to help oversee the modernization of labs in the former Soviet states, including the lab in Georgia, while serving as the CDC’s regional director for Central Asia from 2000 to 2008. He said there was no chance that the U.S.-funded labs were performing any work on biological weapons. “The most important difference between biological weapons development,” and the mundane but vital work of identifying, describing, and studying the viruses and bacteria that occur in nature and pose a threat to public health, Favorov told me, “is that none of these labs have any type of equipment for the modification of the strain.” “In all these labs,” he said, “you only have the equipment which might describe what you have, but not to modify it.” Update: Friday, March 18, 3:05 a.m.

About 30 minutes after this article was published on Thursday, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican who appears to also represent the extreme reaches of the internet, introduced Russian disinformation about “bioweapons” in U.S.-funded labs in Ukraine into the Congressional record. On the House floor, Greene repeated the claims that have jumped from Russian state media to Infowars to Fox News as she introduced the “Stopping the Spread of Taxpayer-Funded Bioweapon Act.”

1,e1d269f1-3542-429b-b9e9-a07b8cb1a753,['Justin Ling'],2022-03-18 00:00:00,"The American rightwing media’s trumpeting of a conspiracy theory about Ukrainian biological facilities that masked a clandestine bioweapons programme has now rocketed from a fringe QAnon channel directly to Fox News and Donald Trump Jr.

The Russian propaganda machine is so engaged in sowing disinformation about their invasion of Ukraine that they are even ordering Russian TV to broadcast one of the bioweapon theory’s largest boosters: Tucker Carlson.

The conspiracy theory began in seeming obscurity. In the hours after Russia launched its aerial bombardment of Ukraine, the Twitter account of a longtime follower of the QAnon conspiracy movement remarked that approximately 30 biolabs were dotted across Ukraine.

“China and Russia indirectly (and correctly) blamed the US for the [Covid-19] outbreak,” the user, who goes by the username @WarClandestine, tweeted. “And are fearful that the US/allies have more viruses (bioweapons) to let out.” The invasion, he posited, was truly about destroying those facilities and the viruses they contained.

In effect, this theory was just a remix of an allegation that Moscow has made for years: accusing the United States of running a secret bioweapons program, often in eastern Europe. A close adviser to President Vladimir Putin alleged last year that Washington “deliberately caused” the coronavirus pandemic and pointed his finger at US-funded laboratories near Russian and Chinese borders.

In January, the Bulgarian journalist Dilyana Gaytandzhieva wrote a sensationalist piece accusing the US of conducting biological experiments on Ukrainian and Georgian soldiers. Gaytandzhieva has previously published overt Russian disinformation, and her reporting was picked up by pro-Russian channels. Gaytandzhieva was even awarded a journalism prize last month by a pro-Russian Latvian politician to “encourage her for new research”, according to a press release.

Around the same time, John Mark Dougan – an American in Moscow, on the lam from wiretapping and extortion charges in Florida – began posting a similar theory, citing a Ukrainian whistleblower. “Washington and its funded laboratories are playing a very dangerous game with these viruses,” he warned in a December 2021 video.

This disinformation laid the groundwork for the QAnon-linked conspiracy theory about Ukrainian biolabs in late February. In less than 24 hours, the far-right US conspiracy site Infowars, which played a particularly acute role in promoting Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and the lie that the 2020 election was stolen, ran a story based on the allegation. The headline read: Russian Strikes Targeting US-Run Bio-Labs in Ukraine?

From there, the theory percolated through an array of QAnon and conspiracy theory websites, podcasts and video channels.

The very core of the story is true: the Department of Defense funds biological research and laboratories in Ukraine, and elsewhere in Europe and the Caucasus, in order to surveil emerging infectious diseases and to keep secure facilities that housed a Soviet bioweapons program. But Washington insists that it does not fund biological weapons research anywhere, much less in Ukraine – a claim backed up by a bevy of international organisations and non-proliferation advocates.

Despite that, the claim made its way to Tucker Carlson Tonight, which boasts more than 3 million viewers a night on Fox News. On his show, Carlson insisted that the United States was “funding the creation of deadly pathogens” and played clips of spokespeople for the Russian and Chinese regimes, accusing Washington of operating a bioweapons programme in Europe.

Carlson pursued the story on three different episodes of his show over the past week. On 10 March he brought on writer Glenn Greenwald. “When the government comes out and emphatically denies that they have biological weapons,” Greenwald said. “We know they’re not telling the truth.”

These claims have led to an active feedback loop with Russian state propaganda.

Tass, the Russian news agency seen as a mouthpiece for the Kremlin, has recently accused “Ukrainian radicals” of planning to use “toxic chemicals” against Russian forces or even Ukrainian civilians. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has said publicly that these labs are “deadly threats” to the Russian state. These claims have been promoted widely by an array of Russian social media channels, television stations and commentators.

The interplay between American reporting on these biolabs and the Russian response is no accident.

Mother Jones obtained a missive from the department of information and telecommunications support, instructing Russian media to, per a translation, “use as much as possible fragments of broadcasts of the popular Fox News host Tucker Carlson”.

Specifically, the department called on its mouthpieces in Russian media to highlight that “activities of military biological laboratories with American participation on the territory of Ukraine carried global threats to Russia and Europe”.

All told, the propaganda effort might be an effort to cover up something much more sinister in its own back yard. In a 2021 report, the US state department took the extraordinary step of accusing Moscow of continuing its Soviet-era bioweapons programme.

While Russia submits annual reports to the United Nations stating it has no active bioweapons programme, Washington believes that “the Russian Federation has revised plans and funding to its national chemical and biological facilities.”

But the effort continues, even when contradictory.

On Thursday, state propaganda outlet Sputnik published new documents which, they claim, show “components of biological weapons were being created in Ukraine with direct US involvement and financing”. The US documents themselves, however, clearly contradict that. The Pentagon’s funding will “help to detect, prevent, and predict disease emergence in the region”, reads a 2019 request for funding, reportedly released from the Russian defense ministry.",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/18/ukrainian-bioweapons-labs-qanon-fox-news

Russia is now strengthening its accusations against the US of developing biological weapons in Ukraine with documents and evidence it had detained amid its military operations in its neighboring country, and the US keeps claiming that Russia's accusations are ""disinformation"" even if statements from different officials of the Biden administration are contradictory, and this has caused rising international concerns over US biolabs worldwide.Russian President Vladimir Putin gave an extensive speech on the Ukraine crisis on Wednesday. ""There was a network of dozens of laboratories in Ukraine, where military biological programs were conducted under the guidance and with the financial support of the Pentagon, including experiments with coronavirus strains, anthrax, cholera, African swine fever and other deadly diseases,"" Putin said during his speech.Putin noted that ""frantic attempts"" are underway to conceal the ""traces of these secret programs,"" according to RT.Analysts said Putin's remarks showed that Russia is very serious about the accusations against the US, and apart from providing documents it had obtained in Ukraine, and in order to further verify the accusations, Moscow and Kiev could consider inviting an international investigation team to include neutral countries like China, India, Turkey and representatives from international organizations to enter the relevant facilities to collect more direct and convincing evidence.The responses from Washington have made the international community more concerned. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki last week called out Russian claims that the United States has secretly operated chemical and biological weapons laboratories on Ukrainian territory as a ""disinformation campaign.""But Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland previously said at a hearing in Congress that the US has ""biological research facilities"" in Ukraine and she said ""we are now in fact quite concerned that Russian troops… may be seeking to gain control of [those labs], so we are working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces should they approach.""The US is a country that has rejected the protocol of monitoring bioweapons to strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), so all its biolabs worldwide have no transparency. Due to the accidents related to these labs in the past, and the nasty record of the US using biological and chemical weapons in Vietnam and the Korean Peninsula, experts said it's necessary for the international community to exert more pressure on the US to accept the BWC, and to prevent it from using other countries' soil for Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) development.Wang Yiwei, director of the institute of international affairs at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Thursday that the US needs hundreds of biolabs worldwide in the territories of its allies so that when it can't break the nuclear balance with its competitors, it needs some other WMDs to reinforce its strategic deterrence, and the biological and chemical weapons are their choices.""The international community has already been greatly concerned about US military biological activities. They have 336 laboratories around the world. This number comes from the information provided by the US to the Conference of Parties of the BWC,"" Chinese Ambassador to the UN Zhang Jun said at a UN Security Council meeting on March 11 on the matter of US biolabs in Ukraine. At the meeting, the US groundlessly accused China of spreading disinformation while China was just simply urging the US to clarify itself with transparency and evidence.Du Kaiyuan, a Shanghai-based military commentator, said the US needs hundreds of such facilities around the world rather than concentrate on the research at its domestic labs because ""the tests for biological weapons need live tests which might cause legal problems in the US, but it can get enough samples from other countries.""The concerns are not only from Russia and China. Experts from many other countries, including the US, also raised their concerns over the matter.Jeffrey Kaye, a former clinical psychologist in San Francisco, told the Global Times on Thursday in a video interview that the US needs to provide the documentation and open up to what's really being done in those labs in Ukraine.""We need to declassify the records going back to the end of World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War so that we can find out what they are doing in these hundreds of biolabs."" But unfortunately, ""the problem is they [the US government] won't do that,"" Kaye said.Sheradil Baktygulov, a Kyrgyz independent political analyst based in Bishkek, told the Global Times on Thursday, ""The formal explanations of the US authorities on more than 300 US biolabs activities around the world do not match the real situation on the ground. The truth is much darker as has been shown by many independent investigations since 2018.""""There were numerous mysterious outbreaks of human illnesses and losses of livestock in Georgia, Ukraine and Russian provinces bordering that country since 2007. Moreover, the US is keeping its bioweapons in violation of international treaties,"" he.If the US is a peaceful and peacemaking country and follows democratic principles, then it has to be more transparent and open on US biolab operations around the world, said Baktygulov, noting that ""Greater transparency will give mankind the opportunity to see beyond the formal explanations on US biolabs and the US might be recognized as a more trusted partner internationally.""""At this point, all humanity needs transparency, not only the people on the battlefield but also the entire world,"" Abdullah Agar, a security expert and academic at the Istanbul-based Bahcesehir University, said in a recent interview with the Xinhua News Agency.Korkut Ulucan, a Turkish specialist in medical biology and genetics, said such laboratories must be accessible to international scientific committees, and their activities need to be audited by multiple independent organizations.""To prevent a leak, these laboratories should be gradually evacuated with utmost care, under high-level security conditions and the supervision of a committee of scientists, and they must be inactivated,"" Ulucan, also an academic at the Istanbul-based Marmara University and lecturer at the Uskudar University, told Xinhua.

Wang said that the problem is that the current international order can't impose very effective restrictions and law enforcement on the US when it violates international laws or breaks the basic norms of international relations, or force it to be transparent on sensitive issues like WMDs.""So if the US refuses to be transparent and be immune to accusations from Russia and keeps pretending to be blind to the concerns raised by world scientists, Washington won't pay a significant price,"" he said.Song Zhongping, a military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times that the international community can keep pressuring the US to accept the protocol for monitoring bioweapons of the BWC, as this is the obligation that the US should take, so that it will abide by laws, and the difficulties for the US to continue such research worldwide will be harder.""And those US allies who have cooperated with the US on biological research with military or CIA backgrounds should also be responsible for their own people's security, and these countries should also join the BWC and execute the right to monitor what the US is doing in their countries,"" Song noted.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202203/1255185.shtml

Putin adds to voices of concern over the facilities' biological-military roles

The United States has been urged to act responsibly and clarify matters regarding its global biological-military activities, including at its biological laboratories in Ukraine.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that components of biological weapons have been created in Ukraine.

""A network of dozens of laboratories was operated in Ukraine, where military-biological programs were conducted under the guidance and financial support of the Pentagon, including experiments with samples of coronavirus, anthrax, cholera, African swine fever, and other deadly diseases,"" Putin said.

Putin stressed that strenuous efforts have been made to cover up ""the traces of these secret programs"".

""But we have every reason to believe that components of biological weapons were in fact created in the immediate vicinity of Russia on the territory of Ukraine,"" the Russian head of state said.

Earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry revealed that the US had poured money into biological laboratories in Ukraine, where experiments with bat coronavirus samples have been carried out.

The ministry said it had obtained documents detailing US biological-military activities in Ukraine, including information relating to the transfer abroad of the Ukrainian labs' biomaterial.

According to earlier Russian media reports, the official documents indicate that US military doctors are studying the use of pathogens associated with especially dangerous diseases in different regions of Ukraine. Outbreaks of these infectious diseases serve as confirmation of the US activities.

In 2009, 450 Ukrainians became victims of hemorrhagic pneumonia in Ternopil. In 2011, 33 Ukrainians suffered from cholera and in 2014 that number reached 800.

On March 8, while testifying before a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Ukraine, US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland admitted ""Ukraine has biological research facilities"".

However, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US permanent representative to the United Nations, later said at a UN Security Council meeting: ""There are no Ukrainian biological weapons laboratories supported by the United States.""

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Tuesday stressed the importance of establishing a verification mechanism relating to the US-funded biological laboratories in Ukraine given the concerns they caused. The issues related to these labs must be addressed within the framework of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, or BWC.

In addition to the more than 30 bio-labs in Ukraine, the US has created ""hundreds of such laboratories"" in other countries, Lavrov said.

International appeal

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said that the international community has long had serious concerns over the US' biological-military activities.

According to what has been submitted by the US, the country has 336 bio-labs in 30 countries. This is not a problem confined to US labs in Ukraine, nor is it a new issue arising from the current situation, he said.

The US has an obligation to abide by the BWC and clarify what it is doing in order to address the concerns of the international community. It cannot muddle through by deflecting attention, he said.

Abdullah Agar, a security expert and academic at Istanbul's Bahcesehir University, said that all humanity needs transparency on the bio-labs in Ukraine, not just the people who may face the risks on the battlefield.

Korkut Ulucan, a specialist in medical biology and genetics, said the laboratories must be made accessible to international scientific committees and their activities audited by independent organizations. ""To prevent a leak, these laboratories should be gradually evacuated with utmost care, under high-level security conditions and the supervision of a committee of scientists, and they must be inactivated,"" Ulucan said.

Ulucan warned that a possible lab leakage and the ""uncontrolled emergence of secret activities ""could lead to massive destruction.

The US government has admitted there are a number of such facilities in Ukraine funded by Washington that do research on deadly pathogens, albeit from a preventative perspective rather than to create a weapon.

Regardless, the US officials have expressed concern that the pathogens could fall into Russian hands and has urged that any harmful pathogens be destroyed. The World Heath Organisation has also made such a recommendation.

Russia has claimed without evidence the US is developing biological and chemical weapons in Ukraine and that it discovered efforts to clean up these programmes when it launched its so-called “special military operation”, an invasion that has led to thousands of deaths and indiscriminate targeting of civilian targets.

The US has denounced the claims, which have been repeated by China, as classic disinformation from Moscow.

Now, the issue has been seized on by some on the right, such as Fox News’s Tucker Carlson, who has been accused of intentionally implying the “bio labs” have a more sinister side to them. He has denied doing so.

And former Democratic congressman Tulsi Gabbard, who ran for the presidency in 2020, has been accused of “treason” by Mitt Romney, after she posted a two-minute video calling for a ceasefire in Ukraine to enable any harmful materials to be removed and accusing the Biden administration of a cover-up.

“Tulsi Gabbard is parroting false Russian propaganda. Her treasonous lies may well cost lives,” he tweeted.

So what do we know about these bio-labs and the claims being made about them?

Russia claims it found US bio-weapons programme in Ukraine

At the beginning of March, Russia’s defence and foreign ministries made the incendiary claim the US was funding bioweapons research in Ukraine. They said during “the course of the special military operation evidence of an emergency clean-up performed by the Kyiv government had been found aimed at eradicating traces of the military-biological programme”.

Maria Zakharova, a spokesperson for the Russian foreign ministry, called on Washington to come clean about what she termed “illegal activities in Ukraine”.

She said Russia had documents showing the Ukrainian health ministry had ordered the destruction of samples of plague, cholera, anthrax and other pathogens before February 24, when Russian forces moved into Ukraine.

“It can be concluded that components of biological weapons were being developed in Ukrainian biolabs located in close vicinity of our border,” she said. “The emergency destruction of dangerous pathogens on February 24 was a necessary step aimed at concealing the fact that Ukraine and the US had violated Article 1 of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention.”

What does the US say about this – and why does it think Russia is making assertions?

The US has denied the claims it has backed a bioweapons programme or is developing such weapons in Ukraine. It has also claimed Russia is making these assertions in order to give it cover should it decide to launch chemical or biological weapons attacks itself.

“Now that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them,” tweeted Jen Psaki, the White House Press Secretary. “It’s a clear pattern.”

✕ Tucker Carlson claims Pentagon lying about Ukrainian bio labs

In a statement, Ned Price, spokesperson for the Department of State, accused Russia of “inventing false pretexts in an attempt to justify its own horrific actions in Ukraine” and said Washington was “in full compliance with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention and Biological Weapons Convention, and it does not develop or possess such weapons anywhere”.

John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesperson, called the Russian accusations “absurd”. “There’s nothing to it. It’s classic Russian propaganda,” he told reporters.

For many decades after World War II, the US had an offensive biological weapons programme. Today, it is a member of the Biological Weapons Convention, which was created in 1972 and has renounced biological warfare.

What does does Ukraine say about this?

Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky has said Russia will receive “severe sanctions” if chemical weapons are used in the war and denied Moscow’s accusation his nation is preparing to attack with chemical or biological weapons.

“I am the president of a rational country, a rational nation. And the father of two children. And no chemical or any other weapons of mass destruction were developed on my land,” he said in a video statement.

“The whole world knows that. You know that. And if Russia does something like that against us, it will get the most severe sanctions in response.”

✕ ABC Reporter accuses Tucker Carlson of ‘plagiarising’ Putin

So what are those ‘bio-labs’ in Ukraine?

The US has acknowledged that Washington has funded a number of biological research facilities in Ukraine.

In congressional testimony last week, Victoria Nuland, the Under Secretary of State, was asked by senator Marco Rubio whether Ukraine “has chemical or biological weapons”.

“Ukraine has biological research facilities which we are now quite concerned that Russian forces may be seeking to gain control of,” she responded. “We are working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces should they approach.”

Mr Rubio pointed out that Russia was already claiming the Ukraine was seeking to make use of biological weapons.

“If there’s a biological or chemical weapon incident or or attack inside of Ukraine, is there any doubt in your mind that 100 per cent it would be the Russians that would be behind it?” he asked.

Ms Nuland responded: “There is no doubt in my mind, senator, and it is classic Russian technique to blame on the other guy what they’re planning to do themselves.”

The US state department said the facilities Ms Nuland was referring to were diagnostic and biodefence laboratories, which are different from biological weapons facilities.

The website of the US Embassy in Ukraine says: “The US Department of Defence’s Biological Threat Reduction Programme collaborates with partner countries to counter the threat of outbreaks (deliberate, accidental, or natural) of the world’s most dangerous infectious diseases.”

The Director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines, told the Senate Intelligence Committee that Ukraine “operates a little over a dozen” biolabs for biodefence and public health response. She said the US has, at least in the past, “provided assistance” to the labs “in the context of biosafety”.

“Which is something we have done with a variety of different countries,” she added.

She said the labs were not being used to develop weapons.

“We do not assess that Ukraine is pursuing either biological weapons or nuclear weapons. This influence campaign is consistent with long-standing Russian efforts to accuse the United States of sponsoring bioweapons. ... This is a classic move by the Russians.”

(AP)

What does the UN say about this?

The United Nations’s High Representative of Disarmament Affairs Izumi Nakamitsu told a recent meeting of the security council the UN was “not aware” of any biological weapons programmes in Ukraine.

“Situations such as this demonstrate the need to strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention,” said Ms Nakamitsu.

How did this get into the right wing media?

Various right wing platforms and promoters of QAnon have been repeating the claims, in what critics have said is a boost to Russian disinformation efforts.

Alex Jones’ long debunked disinformation site InfoWars claimed without evidence that Russia had targeted US-run bioweapons labs “in many cities” in Ukraine shortly after Russia’s invasion began. It hosted one “expert” who claimed to have revealed bio labs in China and Ukraine run by the US.

How did it end up in mainstream media?

The person who has given most coverage to the “biolabs” story is Fox News’s top ranking anchor, Tucker Carlson, whose comments on the topic have often appeared to hint the US is covering up what is happening.

In a widely watched segment last week after Ms Nuland’s testimony, he concluded: “Does Ukraine have biological weapons? Ugh, Ukraine has biological research facilities. What? You mean secret bio labs like the secret bio labs that Ukraine definitely doesn’t have? Ukraine has those? Yes, it does.

“And not only does Ukraine have secret bio labs, Toria Nuland said, whatever they’re doing in those labs is so dangerous and so scary that she is, ‘quite concerned’ that the so-called research material inside those bio labs might fall into the hands of Russian forces.”

While fans of Carlson claim he is highlighting uncomfortable truths, critics say he is intentionally making false insinuations that play into Russia’s efforts at disinformation.

Shortly after Ms Nuland’s testimony, former congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard posted a two-minute video in which she stated what she said were “the undeniable facts”.

“There are 25 to 30 us funded bio labs in Ukraine. According to the US government, these bio labs are conducting research on dangerous pathogens,” she said. “Ukraine is in an active war zone with widespread bombing artillery and shelling and these facilities, even in the best of circumstances could easily be compromised and release these deadly pathogens.” She also said the US was funding labs around the world involved in “dangerous research”.

After her video was posted, Republican Senator Mitt Romney tweeted: “Tulsi Gabbard is parroting false Russian propaganda. Her treasonous lies may well cost lives.”

Ms Gabbbard has since “clarified” her remarks, claiming there might have been some “miscommunication and misunderstanding” about the terms bio labs and bio weapons labs.

“‘Biolabs’ are facilities which contain and experiment with dangerous pathogens, ostensibly for the purpose of serving the public good (i.e vaccines, etc.). ‘Biological weapons labs’ are facilities which exist for the purpose of turning pathogens into weapons so they can be used against an enemy (i.e. ‘bioweapons’),” she said on Twitter.

“The danger of pathogens being released from biolabs in Ukraine is very real, and we need to take action immediately to prevent an impending catastrophe.”

She added: “Mitt Romney and others say that I’m treasonous because I called for a ceasefire around the 25+ biolabs in Ukraine to prevent the breach of such facilities and escape of pathogens, and prevent more pandemics. Romney should resign.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/ukraine-biolabs-fox-tucker-carlson-tulsi-gabbard-b2039117.html

Kent Macdougall']",2022-03-17 00:00:00,"Self-anointed “fact-checkers” in the U.S. corporate press have spent two weeksmocking as disinformation and a false conspiracy theory the claim that Ukraine has biological weapons labs, either alone or with U.S. support. They never presented any evidence for their ruling–how could they possibly know? and how could they prove the negative?–but nonetheless they invoked their characteristically authoritative, above-it-all tone of self-assurance and self-arrogated right to decree the truth, definitively labelling such claims false.

Claims that Ukraine currently maintains dangerous biological weapons labs came from Russia as well as China. The Chinese Foreign Ministry this month claimed: “The U.S. has 336 labs in 30 countries under its control, including 26 in Ukraine alone.” The Russian Foreign Ministry asserted that “Russia obtained documents proving that Ukrainian biological laboratories located near Russian borders worked on development of components of biological weapons.” Such assertions deserve the same level of skepticism as U.S. denials: namely, none of it should be believed to be true or false absent evidence. Yet U.S. fact-checkers dutifully and reflexively sided with the U.S. Government to declare such claims “disinformation” and to mock them as QAnon conspiracy theories.

Unfortunately for this propaganda racket masquerading as neutral and high-minded fact-checking, the neocon official long in charge of U.S. policy in Ukraine testified on Monday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and strongly suggested that such claims are, at least in part, true. Yesterday afternoon, Under Secretary of State Victoria Nuland appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), hoping to debunk growing claims that there are chemical weapons labs in Ukraine, smugly asked Nuland:

Does Ukraine have chemical or biological weapons?

Rubio undoubtedly expected a flat denial by Nuland, thus providing further “proof” that such speculation is dastardly Fake News emanating from the Kremlin, the CCP and QAnon. Instead, Nuland did something completely uncharacteristic for her, for neocons, and for senior U.S. foreign policy officials: for some reason, she told a version of the truth. Her answer visibly stunned Rubio, who–as soon as he realized the damage she was doing to the U.S. messaging campaign by telling the truth–interrupted her and demanded that she instead affirm that if a biological attack were to occur, everyone should be “100% sure” that it was Russia who did it. Grateful for the life raft, Nuland told Rubio he was right.

But Rubio’s clean-up act came too late. When asked whether Ukraine possesses “chemical or biological weapons,” Nuland did not deny this: at all. She instead–with palpable pen-twirling discomfort and in halting speech, a glaring contrast to her normally cocky style of speaking in obfuscatory State Department officialese–acknowledged: “uh, Ukraine has, uh, biological research facilities.” Any hope to depict such “facilities” as benign or banal was immediately destroyed by the warning she quickly added: “we are now in fact quite concerned that Russian troops, Russian forces, may be seeking to, uh, gain control of [those labs], so we are working with the Ukrainiahhhns [sic] on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces should they approach”–[interruption by Sen. Rubio]:

Nuland’s bizarre admission that “Ukraine has biological research facilities” that are dangerous enough to warrant concern that they could fall into Russian hands ironically constituted more decisive evidence of the existence of such programs in Ukraine than what was offered in 2002 and 2003 to corroborate U.S. allegations about Saddam’s chemical and biological programs in Iraq. An actual against-interest confession from a top U.S. official under oath is clearly more significant than Colin Powell’s holding up some test tube with an unknown substance inside while he pointed to grainy satellite images that nobody could decipher.

It should go without saying that the existence of a Ukrainian biological “research” program does not justify an invasion by Russia, let alone an attack as comprehensive and devastating as the one unfolding: no more than the existence of a similar biological program under Saddam would have rendered the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq justifiable. But Nuland’s confession does shed critical light on several important issues and raises vital questions that deserve answers.

Any attempt to claim that Ukraine’s biological facilities are just benign and standard medical labs is negated by Nuland’s explicitly grave concern that “Russian forces may be seeking to gain control of” those facilities and that the U.S. Government therefore is, right this minute, “working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces.” Russia has its own advanced medical labs. After all, it was one of the first countries to develop a COVID vaccine, one which Lancet, on February 1, 2021, pronounced was “ safe and effective” (even though U.S. officials pressured multiple countries, including Brazil, not to accept any Russian vaccine, while U.S. allies such as Australia refused for a full year to recognize the Russian COVID vaccine for purposes of its vaccine mandate). The only reason to be “quite concerned” about these “biological research facilities” falling into Russian hands is if they contain sophisticated materials that Russian scientists have not yet developed on their own and which could be used for nefarious purposes–i.e., either advanced biological weapons or dual-use “research” that has the potential to be weaponized.

What is in those Ukrainian biological labs that make them so worrisome and dangerous? And has Ukraine, not exactly known for being a great power with advanced biological research, had the assistance of any other countries in developing those dangerous substances? Is American assistance confined to what Nuland described at the hearing–“working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces”–or did the U.S. assistance extend to the construction and development of the “biological research facilities” themselves?

For all the dismissive language used over the last two weeks by self-described “fact-checkers,” it is confirmed that the U.S. has worked with Ukraine, as recently as last year, in the “development of a bio-risk management culture; international research partnerships; and partner capacity for enhanced bio-security, bio-safety, and bio-surveillance measures.” The U.S. Embassy in Ukraine publicly boasted of its collaborative work with Ukraine “to consolidate and secure pathogens and toxins of security concern and to continue to ensure Ukraine can detect and report outbreaks caused by dangerous pathogens before they pose security or stability threats.”

This joint U.S./Ukraine biological research is, of course, described by the State Department in the most unthreatening way possible. But that again prompts the question of why the U.S. would be so gravely concerned about benign and common research falling into Russian hands. It also seems very odd, to put it mildly, that Nuland chose to acknowledge and describe the “facilities” in response to a clear, simple question from Sen. Rubio about whether Ukraine possesses chemical and biological weapons. If these labs are merely designed to find a cure for cancer or create safety measures against pathogens, why, in Nuland’s mind, would it have anything to do with a biological and chemical weapons program in Ukraine?

The indisputable reality is that–despite long-standing international conventions banning development of biological weapons–all large, powerful countries conduct research that, at the very least, has the capacity to be converted into biological weapons. The work conducted under the guise of “defensive research” can, and sometimes is, easily converted into the banned weapons themselves. Recall that, according to the FBI, the 2001 anthrax attacks that terrorized the nation came from a U.S. Army Research scientist, Dr. Bruce Ivins, working at the U.S. Army’s infectious disease research lab in Fort Detrick, Maryland. The claim was that the Army was “merely” conducting defensive research to find vaccines and other protections against weaponized anthrax, but to do so, the Army had to create highly weaponized anthrax strains, which Ivins then unleashed as a weapon.

A 2011 PBS Frontline program on those anthrax attacks explained: “in October 2001, Northern Arizona University microbiologist Dr. Paul Keim identified that the anthrax used in the attack letters was the Ames strain, a development he described as ‘chilling’ because that particular strain was developed in U.S. government laboratories.” Speaking to Frontline in 2011, Dr. Keim explained why it was so alarming to discover that the U.S. Army had been cultivating such highly lethal and dangerous strains in its lab, on U.S. soil:

We were surprised it was the Ames strain. And it was chilling at the same time, because the Ames strain is a laboratory strain that had been developed by the U.S. Army as a vaccine-challenge strain. We knew that it was highly virulent. In fact, that’s why the Army used it, because it represented a more potent challenge to vaccines that were being developed by the U.S. Army. It wasn’t just some random type of anthrax that you find in nature; it was a laboratory strain, and that was very significant to us, because that was the first hint that this might really be a bioterrorism event.

This lesson about the severe dangers of so-called dual-use research into biological weapons was re-learned over the last two years as a result of the COVID pandemic. While the origins of that virus have not yet been proven with dispositive evidence (though remember, fact-checkers declared early on that it was definitively established that it came from species-jumping and that any suggestion of a lab leak was a “conspiracy theory,” only for the Biden White House in mid-2021 to admit they did not know the origins and ordered an investigation to determine whether it came from a lab leak), what is certain is that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was manipulating various coronavirus strains to make them more contagious and lethal. The justification was that doing so is necessary to study how vaccines could be developed, but regardless of intent, cultivating dangerous biological strains has the capacity to kill huge numbers of people. All of this illustrates that research that is classified as “defensive” can easily be converted, deliberately or otherwise, into extremely destructive biological weapons.

At the very least, Nuland’s surprising revelation reveals, yet again, just how heavily involved the U.S. Government is and for years has been in Ukraine, on the part of Russia’s border which U.S. officials and scholars from across the spectrum have spent decades warning is the most sensitive and vulnerable for Moscow. It was Nuland herself, while working for Hillary Clinton and John Kerry’s State Department under President Obama, who was heavily involved in what some call the 2014 revolution and others call the “coup” that resulted in a change of government in Ukraine from a Moscow-friendly regime to one far more favorable to the EU and the West. All of this took place as the Ukrainian energy company Burisma paid $50,000 per month not to the son of a Ukrainian official but to Joe Biden’s son, Hunter: a reflection of who wielded real power inside Ukraine.

Nuland not only worked for both the Obama and Biden State Departments to run Ukraine policy (and, in many ways, Ukraine itself), but she also was Vice President Dick Cheney’s deputy national security adviser and then President Bush’s Ambassador to NATO. She comes from one of America’s most prestigious neocon royal families; her husband, Robert Kagan, was a co-founder of the notorious neocon war-mongering group Project for the New American Century, which advocated regime change in Iraq long before 9/11. It was Kagan, along with liberal icon Bill Kristol, who (next to current editor-in-chief of The Atlantic Jeffrey Goldberg), was most responsible for the lie that Saddam was working hand-in-hand with Al Qaeda, a lie that played a key role in convincing Americans to believe that Saddam was personally involved in the planning of 9/11.

That a neocon like Nuland is admired and empowered regardless of the outcome of elections illustrates how unified and in lockstep the establishment wings of both parties are when it comes to questions of war, militarism and foreign policy. Indeed, Nuland’s husband, Robert Kagan, was signaling that neocons would likely support Hillary Clinton for president–doing so in 2014, long before anyone imagined Trump as her opponent–based on the recognition that the Democratic Party was now more hospitable to neocon ideology than the GOP, where Ron Paul and then Trump’s neo-isolationism was growing.

You can vote against neocons all you want, but they never go away. The fact that a member of one of the most powerful neocon families in the U.S. has been running Ukraine policy for the U.S. for years–having gone from Dick Cheney to Hillary Clinton and Obama and now to Biden–underscores how little dissent there is in Washington on such questions. It is Nuland’s extensive experience in wielding power in Washington that makes her confession yesterday so startling: it is the sort of thing people like her lie about and conceal, not admit. But now that she did admit it, it is crucial that this revelation not be buried and forgotten.",https://mronline.org/2022/03/17/victoria-nuland-ukraine-has-biological-research-facilities-worried-russia-may-seize-them/

(Jason DeCrow/AP)

United States Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield slammed Russia's attempts to lie about allegations of biological weapons in Ukraine once again Friday morning.

""As I said one week ago, Ukraine does not have a biological weapons program. There are no Ukrainian biological weapons laboratories – not near Russia’s border, not anywhere. There are only public health facilities, proudly, and I say proudly, supported and recognized by the US government, the World Health Organization, and other governments and international institutions,"" Thomas-Greenfield said in prepared remarks to the UN Security Council.

Ukrainian and US officials have repeatedly debunked claims of US-supported biological programs in Ukraine.

Friday's emergency session was called by Russia after they announced Thursday that they would not call for a vote on their humanitarian draft resolution on Ukraine.

Thomas-Greenfield instead said ""it is Russia that has a well-documented history of using chemical weapons"" and that Friday's meeting is 'the result of their isolation on this Council and on the world stage.""

""We aren’t going to dignify Russia’s disinformation or conspiracy theories,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. ""I will not repeat the slurs and false accusations that Russia has hurled against the Ukrainian people and the United States repeatedly at this table. But we know that Russia’s disinformation is a sign of its desperation. That’s the truth, and we will continue to ensure the world sees it and hears it.""

Russian Ambassador to the United Nations Vassily Nebenzia claimed Friday that new details show evidence of US-supported biological weapons in Ukraine.

""Over the last week, new details have come to light which allows to state that the components for biological weapons were being created on the territory of Ukraine,"" Nebenzia said in translated remarks to the council. ""We can see that the American colleagues were not helping, as they claim, the Ukrainian Ministry of Health, but rather the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense.""

Nebenzia claimed that a new document distributed to the council Friday morning ""confirms direct funding and supervision of the Pentagon and its defense threat reduction agency of military and biological projects in Ukraine.""

""The representative of the US State Department continue to muddle the information and ascertain that US allegedly does not operate in any biological laboratories in the territory of Ukraine, but the facts show otherwise,"" the Russian ambassador claimed.

More context: There are US-funded biolabs in Ukraine, but they are not building bioweapons. Actually, it's the opposite: Part of the reason for their creation was to secure old Soviet weapons left behind in the former Soviet republics. The State Department has described the claims as nonsense — and the US and Ukrainian governments have repeatedly, and for years now, tried to bat down conspiracy theories about the labs and spoken about the work that is actually being done in them.

Russia's falsehoods about labs like this have not been limited to Ukraine, and the country has been pushing various bits of disinformation about the US and biological weapons since the Cold War.
