Ukrainian officials in Enerhodar have reported a fire at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) early March 4 following strikes by Russian forces. According to authorities, shelling caused a fire at the first block of the plant. Unconfirmed reports suggest that firefighting efforts are underway. The extent of the damage from the fire and ongoing clashes is unclear; however, a spokesperson from the power plant said that there is currently no threat of radiation spreading. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) also released a statement saying they are aware of the reported shelling and are in contact with Ukrainian authorities.

Clashes are likely to continue near the power plant over the coming hours. Firefighters will likely continue to attempt to access the site to put out the fire and investigate damages to the facility. Electricity and telecommunication disruptions are also possible if the plant is shutdown.

Energodar is 55 km (34 miles) southwest of Zaporizhzhia.

Advice

Shelter in place until the situation becomes clear. If officials report incoming fire, stay away from windows and exterior walls. Strictly heed the instructions of local security personnel, particularly when ordered to air-raid shelters. Stockpile food, fuel, and water when possible and safe to do so.

An uncontrolled nuclear reaction in a nuclear reactor could result in widespread contamination of air and water. The risk of this happening at nuclear power plants in the United States is small because of the diverse and redundant barriers and safety systems in place at nuclear power plants, the training and skills of the reactor operators, testing and maintenance activities, and the regulatory requirements and oversight of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. A large area surrounding a nuclear power plant is restricted and guarded by armed security teams. U.S. reactors also have containment vessels that are designed to withstand extreme weather events and earthquakes.

A containment dome on a nuclear reactor Source: Stock photography (copyrighted) did youknow ? Nuclear reactors in the United States may have large concrete domes covering the reactor. A containment structure is required to contain accidental releases of radiation. Not all nuclear power plants have cooling towers. Some nuclear power plants use water from lakes, rivers, or the ocean for cooling.

Nuclear power reactors do not produce direct carbon dioxide emissions

Unlike fossil fuel-fired power plants, nuclear reactors do not produce air pollution or carbon dioxide while operating. However, the processes for mining and refining uranium ore and making reactor fuel all require large amounts of energy. Nuclear power plants also have large amounts of metal and concrete, which require large amounts of energy to manufacture. If fossil fuels are used for mining and refining uranium ore, or if fossil fuels are used when constructing the nuclear power plant, then the emissions from burning those fuels could be associated with the electricity that nuclear power plants generate.

Nuclear energy produces radioactive waste

A major environmental concern related to nuclear power is the creation of radioactive wastes such as uranium mill tailings, spent (used) reactor fuel, and other radioactive wastes. These materials can remain radioactive and dangerous to human health for thousands of years. Radioactive wastes are subject to special regulations that govern their handling, transportation, storage, and disposal to protect human health and the environment. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulates the operation of nuclear power plants.

Radioactive wastes are classified as low-level waste or high-level waste. The radioactivity of these wastes can range from a little higher than natural background levels, such as for uranium mill tailings, to the much higher radioactivity of used (spent) reactor fuel and parts of nuclear reactors. The radioactivity of nuclear waste decreases over time through a process called radioactive decay. The amount of time it takes for the radioactivity of radioactive material to decrease to half its original level is called the radioactive half-life. Radioactive waste with a short half-life is often stored temporarily before disposal to reduce potential radiation doses to workers who handle and transport the waste. This storage system also reduces the radiation levels at disposal sites.

By volume, most of the waste related to the nuclear power industry has a relatively low level of radioactivity. Uranium mill tailings contain the radioactive element radium, which decays to produce the radioactive gas radon. Most uranium mill tailings are placed near the processing facility, or mill, where they come from. Uranium mill tailings are covered with a sealing barrier of material such as clay to prevent radon from escaping into the atmosphere. The sealing barrier is covered by a layer of soil, rocks, or other materials to prevent erosion of the sealing barrier.

The other types of low-level radioactive waste are the tools, protective clothing, wiping cloths, and other disposable items that become contaminated with small amounts of radioactive dust or particles at nuclear fuel processing facilities and nuclear power plants. These materials are subject to special regulations for their handling, storage, and disposal so they will not come in contact with the outside environment.

High-level radioactive waste consists of irradiated, or spent, nuclear reactor fuel (fuel that is no longer useful for producing electricity). The spent reactor fuel is in a solid form, consisting of small fuel pellets in long metal tubes called rods.

Spent reactor fuel storage and reactor decommissioning

Spent reactor fuel assemblies are highly radioactive and, initially, must be stored in specially designed pools of water. The water cools the fuel and acts as a radiation shield. Spent reactor fuel assemblies can also be stored in specially designed dry storage containers. An increasing number of reactor operators now store their older spent fuel in dry storage facilities using special outdoor concrete or steel containers with air cooling. The United States does not currently have a permanent disposal facility for high-level nuclear waste.

When a nuclear reactor stops operating, it must be decommissioned. Decommissioning involves safely removing from service the reactor and all equipment that has become radioactive and reducing radioactivity to a level that permits other uses of the property. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has strict rules governing nuclear power plant decommissioning that involve cleanup of radioactively contaminated power plant systems and structures and removing the radioactive fuel.

At approximately 2:50am local time, local news reported a fire at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant in Energodar, south-east Ukraine.

Ukraine’s foreign minister shared security camera footage from the power plant online. The video appears to show a brightly burning object falling to the ground from out of frame, followed by growing smoke clouds. The minister appealed to Russian forces to fight the fire, for fear of another Chernobyl-scale disaster.

At approximately 3:30am local time, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) announced that director general Rafael Mariano Grossi had spoken to Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmygal. Soon after, the agency reported no change to radiation readings taken at the site by Ukraine’s nuclear regulator.

At 3:47am, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky released a short video criticising Russia for firing on the nuclear plant. The president also said that he did not know how the fire would end. He continued: “Right now, Russian tanks are firing at the nuclear units. These tanks are equipped with thermal imagers. So they know where they are shooting.

“No state in history has ever fired on a nuclear power plant. For the first time in the history of humanity, the terrorist state [Russia] has resorted to nuclear terrors.” Ukrainian news then alleged that a paramilitary organisation had broken into the plant to use it defensively.

At approximately 4am, Ukraine’s state emergency services said that the fire had spread through the top three floors of a training building. However, Russian forces would not allow Ukrainian firefighters access to the site.

Essential equipment remains undamaged, but the IAEA has readied its Incident and Emergency Centre to respond at all times in reaction to the fire.

US President Joe Biden spoke directly to Zelenskyy about the fire later in the night. Before 4.30am Ukraine time, the US and UK Governments both issued statements expressing concern at the fire and nearby fighting. Later, the US said that the plants reactors were being shut down for safety. The UK has requested an emergency UN security council session to discuss events at the plant.

Local news reports that at approximately 5.20am, 40 firefighters have been allowed access to the site.

Comparisons with Chernobyl, and nuclear security at war

The power plant lies near the front lines of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine from the south, with fighting reported in Energodar in recent days. The 6GW Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant began operating in 1984 and now has six reactors, five of which remain offline for maintenance. It is the largest of Ukraine’s four operational nuclear power plants, and the largest nuclear site in Europe. These four plants host 15 reactors, more than half of continue to operate at full capacity.

Immediate comparisons with the Chernobyl disaster have increased concern around the incident, but at time of writing no evidence has yet suggested the compromise of nuclear material.

The meltdown and fire of the Chernobyl plant was the first recorded level 7 nuclear disaster, taking place in 1986. The site lies more than 300 miles (500km) from Zaporizhzhya, in the north of the country. The larger generation capacity of the Zaporizhzhya plant has led some to claim that a nuclear incident at the plant would be significantly more damaging than Chernobyl. However, this claim ignores the massive impact that reactor design, operational processes, and weather have on nuclear material dispersal.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has caused concern over the security of nuclear sites. A small radiation spike in the area surrounding Chernobyl accompanied its capture by Russian forces. However, Grossi has said that the army’s occupation of the site has meant workers “have limited opportunities to communicate, move, and carry out full-fledged maintenance and repair work”.

Since Russia captured the Chernobyl exclusion zone and reactor remains on 24 February, staff have not been allowed to leave. This has led to “psychological pressure and moral exhaustion”.

The destruction of one of two power lines supplying the site has also caused inconvenience. However, backup generators remain functional and the site does not require power to prevent further contamination.

Commenting on this, Grossi said: “Any accident caused as a result of the military conflict could have extremely serious consequences for people and the environment, in Ukraine and beyond.”",https://www.power-technology.com/news/industry-news/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-fire-ukraine-war-russia/

The fighting and fire had raised worldwide alarm because of the potential that they could reach and damage the nuclear reactors and cause a radiation leak.

International monitors said early Friday that there was no immediate sign that radiation had leaked from the Zaporizhzhia plant. The Ukrainian emergency services agency said the fire had been contained to a training facility on the perimeter of the complex.

International observers and Ukrainian officials said that as of 6 a.m. the facility was still able to function safely.

There was damage to “the structure of the reactor compartment” at one of the six reactors, which the State Inspectorate for Nuclear Regulation of Ukraine said did “not affect the safety of the power unit.” That information came after the fire was put out but before it was clear that the Russians were in control of the facility.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/04/world/europe/nuclear-plant-fire.html

Countries around the world swiftly condemned the episode, with the United States embassy in Ukraine warning an attack on a nuclear plant was a ""war crime"" and the United Nations Security Council convening an emergency meeting.

In a statement Friday morning local time, the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate (SNRI) confirmed the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine was occupied by Russian military forces, but said officials remained in contact with plant management.

The power plant's six reactors remained intact, though the compartment auxiliary buildings for reactor unit 1 had been damaged, the SNRI said in its statement. Four of the remaining units were being cooled down while one unit is providing power, the statement said.

Petro Kotin, head of Ukraine's nuclear power operator Energoatom, later reported that management were operating at ""gunpoint."" He said on Telegram that Russian forces ""entered the territory of the nuclear power plant, took control of the personnel and management of the nuclear power plant.""

""Today there is no connection, the station management works at invaders' gunpoint,"" Kotin continued.

""As for the staff, they were admitted in the morning to perform their duties. We do not currently have a direct connection to the station. We get information from the sources at the station.""

Kotin warned that although the reactors are safe, further attacks could lead to ""disaster.""

Ukraine's State Emergency Services (SES) had earlier confirmed several dozen firefighters had extinguished a blaze that had started in a training building outside the main reactor complex, following shelling from Russian military forces.

Reports of the fire raised concern from world leaders and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) -- who called for a stop to fighting around the facility -- though the IAEA said Ukrainian authorities had reported background radiation levels were normal and the fire had not affected ""essential"" equipment.

However the ongoing military operation around the site meant the situation was ""very fragile,"" IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi warned.

Speaking at a press conference in Vienna on Friday, the IAEA's Rossi said the safety of the reactors had not been affected.

""We are fortunate there has not been a release of radioactive material and the integrity of the reactors has not been compromised,"" he said. However, the operator and regulator have relayed to the IAEA that the situation on the ground is ""extremely tense and challenging,"" he warned.

He explained that a Russian projectile had hit a building within the site, causing a localized fire, but none of the reactors were affected and radiation monitoring systems are fully functional.

Ukrainian staff are still at the helm of operations at the plant, but ""effective control"" of the site was in the hands of Russian forces, Grossi said, adding: ""I hope the distinction is clear."" He said that what happens next at Zaporizhzhia is ""a situation that is very difficult to sustain, very fragile"" while there is an active military operation and Russian forces in control. ""This is unprecedented,"" he said. ""Completely uncharted waters.""

Grossi later told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that although radioactive material was not released, it was a ""close call.""

He told Amanpour that he had warned both sides that ""the utmost restraint is to be exercised in and around this type of facility. Because wittingly or unwittingly, you can very quickly go into a disaster, and this is why we're so concerned.""

The US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told the meeting that the world ""narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe last night.""

She called Russia's reactions ""reckless"" and ""dangerous,"" saying it put Europe's largest nuclear power plant at grave risk and threatened the safety of civilians in Russia, in the UK and across the European continent. Russian forces were also 20 miles away from Ukraine's second largest nuclear facility, she noted.

""Nuclear facilities cannot become part of this conflict,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. ""Mr Putin must stop this madness, and he must stop it now.""

Zelensky pushes for no-fly zone

On Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russian troops of committing a ""terror attack"" by intentionally firing at the power plant -- potentially risking the lives of millions.

He later condemned NATO's decision to rule out the implementation of a no-fly zone over the country.

NATO's chief said Friday that a no-fly zone over Ukraine is not an option being considered by the alliance. ""We've agreed that we should not have NATO planes operating over Ukrainian airspace or NATO troops on Ukrainian territory,"" Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said at a press conference earlier in Brussels.

In a Facebook post, Zelensky questioned what the alliance's members were thinking, saying, ""All the people who will die from this day will also die because of you, because of your weakness, because of your disunity."" However, he also expressed his gratitude to NATO countries that have shown support for Ukraine.

Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the establishment of a no-fly zone in Ukraine by the US and it's NATO allies could lead to a ""full-fledged war in Europe,"" but said Washington would continue to work with it's allies to provide Ukrainians with the means to defend themselves from Russian aggression.

Nuclear plant under attack

Reports of the attack on the facility emerged early Friday morning, with video of the scene showing bursts of gunfire apparently directed at the Zaporizhzhia facility before dawn.

Flames could also be seen on video footage, though for some time it was unclear where the fire was or the scale of the threat posed to the facility.

Ukrainian authorities released video later on Friday from inside the facility's control room, with an announcement ringing out on a PA system aimed at the Russian forces outside.

""Stop shooting at a nuclear dangerous facility. Stop shooting immediately! You threaten the security of the whole world!"" the announcement says.

The Russian government has claimed Ukrainian ""provocation"" led to a firefight around the nuclear power plant.

In a video briefing, Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russian forces took the city of Enerhodar, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and the territory adjacent to it on February 28. Konashenkov claimed the plant's technical staff continued regular work on the facilities, but that Ukrainian forces attempted a ""monstrous provocation"" in the early hours of Friday. Konashenkov also claimed the Ukrainians had set fire to the training building themselves.

Smoke rises from tire barricades set on fire in Enerhoda, Ukraine, on March 3.

CNN could not immediately verify any details of the firefight on the territory of the plant.

The Russian government has routinely and without evidence claimed the Ukrainian government is staging ""provocations"" to provoke a military response by Western governments.

It's the not first nuclear plant to come under threat from the Russian invasion. On the first day of the assault, Russian forces seized control of the Chernobyl power plant in northern Ukraine, the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster, according to Ukrainian officials.

The Chernobyl nuclear power plant reactor exploded in 1986, when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union -- sparking a disaster that affected, directly or indirectly, nine million people, due to radioactive materials released into the atmosphere.

The IAEA said in a statement that Ukraine had informed it staff held at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant since Russian military forces took control of the site a week ago were facing ""psychological pressure and moral exhaustion.""",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/03/europe/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-fire-ukraine-intl-hnk/index.html

On 4 March, Russian forces attacked Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant near Enerhodar, in the country’s southeast. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), reported that a building on the site had been hit by a missile and had caught fire. The fire was put out without having caused any direct harm to the reactors, and detectors continue to report normal radiation levels, he said in a press conference at the IAEA’s headquarters in Vienna.

But the incident has highlighted the possible dangers of warfare around nuclear sites, he and others say. Ukraine has 15 working nuclear reactors, which ordinarily produce roughly half of the country’s electricity. With 6 reactors and a capacity of nearly 6 gigawatts, Zaporizhzhia is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. It is now occupied by Russian forces, as is Chernobyl — the site of the worst nuclear accident in history, which took place in 1986.

Nuclear experts gave Nature their assessments of the possible dangers.

Damage from an accidental hit is unlikely

The reactors at Zaporizhzhia have a modern design. Unlike the Chernobyl reactor, each is enclosed in a pressurized steel vessel, which in turn is housed inside a massive reinforced-concrete containment structure. (The design is called VVER — the Russian acronym for water–water energetic reactor.)

The plants also have multiple safety back-up systems, says Michael Bluck, director of the Centre for Nuclear Engineering at Imperial College London. He says that it would be very alarming if the Russian forces were deliberately trying to breach the containment structure, but that catastrophic damage from an accidental hit is unlikely. “If a missile goes astray, I’m less worried about [that]. These are very robust structures,” he says.

Koji Okamoto, a nuclear-safety researcher at the University of Tokyo, agrees. “The containment structure may have a resistance to normal weapons,” he says.

And even at the site of the Chernobyl disaster, the risk of accidental radioactive releases is limited, according to Cheryl Rofer, a retired nuclear scientist based in Santa Fe, New Mexico. “The dangerous material in it is in the basement of the reactor building, protected by the remains of that building and many tons of concrete that have been poured over it,” she wrote in a post on her blog. The ruins of the reactor that exploded in 1986 are enclosed in a massive 63-metre-tall steel and concrete shell called the sarcophagus. “I suspect that a direct artillery hit could breach the shell and allow a small amount of radioactive contaminants to escape, but that solid mass of melted fuel elements, containing uranium and plutonium, is inaccessible,” she wrote.

Spent-fuel ponds are a hazard

Most nuclear power plants — including that at Zaporizhzhia — have pools of water where spent fuel rods are kept as they cool down. Damage to one of these pools, whether accidental or intentional, could cause the water to leak out or boil off. The rods would then overheat and start a fire, several scientists have warned.

Although not comparable to the Chernobyl disaster, such a fire could be hazardous to people in the vicinity of the plant, and even to those further afield. “Russia needs to keep in mind that the prevailing winds are towards Russia,” Rofer tells Nature.

One mitigating factor is that any fuel rods that have been in the pool for several weeks or months are less dangerous than they were at the beginning, because the main cancer-causing isotope — iodine-131 — decays quickly, Bluck points out. At the IAEA press conference, Grossi said that no issues had been reported with Zaporizhzhia’s spent-fuel ponds.

Outside power and cooling must be maintained

As of 4 March, five of Zaporizhzhia’s six reactors had been shut down, Grossi reported. But even powered down, a reactor that’s still loaded with fuel is not completely without risk. Under normal operations, uranium nuclei in the fuel rods undergo fission, or break up, leaving behind nuclei of lighter elements. These isotopes accumulate during the lifetime of the rods, and many of them are highly radioactive, continuing to produce heat even after the reactor is shut down.

This means that the core of a reactor that has just been shut down must be actively cooled, which requires power, normally taken from the grid, to keep water circulating around the core. “You have to remove the decay heat,” Bluck says. “If you don’t cool it until it’s gone, then the core will overheat.” If the reactors’ active cooling suddenly stopped, plants such as Zaporizhzhia could face a scenario analogous to what happened at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Japan, when power was cut off in the aftermath of the 11 March 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, and three reactors melted down.

A similar event could occur if there is damage to the systems — including pumps, heat exchangers and back-up diesel generators — that provide active cooling and are outside a reactor’s protective containment structure, says Okamoto. “Any nuclear reactor could be damaged when coolants are lost.” There are safety systems in place at Ukrainian plants that make the reactors resilient to this damage. “VVER-1000 has several alternative cooling systems,” he says. “So it will not immediately be dangerous.” However, he points out that active cooling might be required for more than ten days after a reactor is shut down. It is unclear whether back-up cooling systems would be able to last that long.

Several specialists told Nature that even if a reactor core were to melt down, it might not cause a large release of radioactive materials. The main impact of such a crisis could be related to psychology and how people — including politicians and policymakers — react. Many Europeans still remember the days when Chernobyl’s radioactive cloud spread over the continent. “People do not judge the risk of radiation well, and they are much more frightened, frequently, than they need to be,” Rofer says.",https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00660-z

Ukrainian officials said on Friday that fire at the largest nuclear power plant in Europe has been extinguished, but that the facility is now under Russian control after fighting.

In a later development at a Friday news conference, the chief of the U.N.'s atomic watchdog said there had been no release of radioactive material at the plant.

Rafael Mariano Grossi, director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said a Russian projectile had hit a structure at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in southeast Ukraine that was not part of the reactor, injuring two people. He said his organization has been in contact with Ukraine's nuclear regulator and managers at the plant after the strike.

""We are fortunate that there was no release of radiation and that the integrity of the reactors themselves was not compromised,"" he said.

Earlier Friday, Mayor Dmytro Orlov of Enerhodar, the town closest to the Zaporizhzhia plant, posted a message on his Telegram account saying the flames had been extinguished. Ukraine's nuclear regulator issued a statement confirming that the fire was out.

The Ukrainian state company that runs the plant posted a message Friday on Telegram saying that the plant is now under Russian control. ""Russian forces are controlling the administrative building and passage into the plant,"" it says. ""Our employees are still inside, ensuring the stable operation of nuclear facilities. Radiation levels are normal,"" it said.

The company said there were deaths among the casualties but did not elaborate, saying its website has come under cyberattack.

The complex came under Russian shelling on Thursday — prompting alarm about any possible radioactive damage and global calls for Russia to halt its attack.

In an emotional middle-of-the-night speech, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the fire could mean ""the end for everyone. The end for Europe. The evacuation of Europe."" He also had a late night phone call with President Biden.

The Zaporizhzhia plant provides a quarter of Ukraine's electricity. The war has already strained Ukraine's critical infrastructure, leading to blackouts across the country.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson criticized the Russian attack and said he would seek an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council, The Associated Press reported. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the attacks ""horrific,"" saying they ""must stop immediately."" Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda called the Russian action an ""act of nuclear terrorism.""

In a rare publicly stated expression of unease about the war in Ukraine, China said it is ""seriously concerned about the safety and security"" of nuclear facilities in Ukraine following the attack.

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told reporters on Friday that China will continue to follow developments at the Zaporizhzhia plant in the city of Enerhodar and ""calls on all parties concerned to maintain calm and restraint, prevent further escalation of the situation and ensure the safety of the nuclear facilities concerned,"" according to The Associated Press.

During the attack, security footage from the plant's main gate, geolocated by NPR, had showed what appeared to be Russian troops at the entrance of the power plant, engaged in active combat on the site. Footage also showed what appeared to be a fire in one of the plant's administrative buildings.

In a brief statement on Thursday, the International Atomic Energy Agency said that it had received a report from Ukraine's atomic regulatory authority stating that Russian armor and infantry had broken through a barricade in a nearby town earlier in the day.

""The battle is going on in the town of Enerhodar and on the road to the ZNPP [Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant] site,"" the regulator told the IAEA, adding that the situation was ""critical.""

Biden spoke with Zelenskyy about the attack and joined him in urging Russia to cease its military activities in the area and allow firefighters and emergency responders to access the site.

U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said on Twitter that she spoke with her Ukrainian counterpart and that the plant's reactors were being safely shut down. She also said, ""We have seen no elevated radiation readings near the facility.""

The IAEA said that the fire had not affected essential equipment and that Ukraine's nuclear regulator reported no change in radiation levels, according to the AP. The American Nuclear Society concurred, saying that the latest radiation levels remained within natural background levels.

The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant is the largest nuclear plant in Europe. It is located in southeastern Ukraine. It consists of six Russian-designed VVER pressurized water reactors that date from the 1980s and 1990s. Ukraine relies on 15 nuclear reactors spread throughout the country for around half of its electricity.

Ukraine was the site of the world's largest nuclear disaster, the 1986 explosion of a reactor at the Chernobyl plant. Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister, warned that if something similar happens at Zaporizhzhia, ""it will be 10 times larger.""

With worries already at an alarming level over Russian President Vladimir Putin putting his nuclear forces on high alert, a battle being waged in Ukraine for Europe's largest nuclear power plant is upping the anxiety over a possible calamity that would likely wreak havoc far beyond the boundaries of the war zone.

During a closing session with representatives of the U.N. Environment Program in Nairobi, delegates were given a chance to give final words and a Ukrainian representative took the opportunity to make a strong statement about what was happening in his country.

""They say they've come to save Ukraine, but they are here to destroy my beautiful country,"" said Pravendnyk, who received a standing ovation at the end of his remarks.

Dmitry Maximychev, Russia's ambassador and permanent representative to the UNEP, responded that Ukraine's military forces have been attacking so-called pro-Russian ""separatists"" in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine for eight years without any protest from the international community.

""The war, which led to the death of 12,000 people in the east of the country, killed by the hands of Ukraine soldiers and neo-Nazi units,"" the Maximychev told the assembly, espousing claims the U.S. and its Western allies say are false and were concocted by the Kremlin as an excuse to invade Ukraine.

""You have just supported them, distinguished delegates. It's them that you were offering your ovation. We didn't begin that war,"" Maximychev said.

Fighting continued Wednesday at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station in Enerhodar, Ukraine, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, both sides claimed.

The battle over the Zaporizhzhia plant prompted the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog group, to issue a warning over the ""unprecedented"" nature of this situation.

Rafael Grossi, director-general of the IAEA, said he and members of the agency are ""gravely concerned"" that a military conflict is happening for the first time amid the facilities of a large, established nuclear power program.

During an emergency IAEA board of governors meeting, Grossi said an incident affecting nuclear facilities ""could have severe consequences, aggravating human suffering and causing environmental harm"" beyond Ukraine's borders.

He said Russia informed the agency Tuesday that it had taken control of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant, but ABC News has not been able to independently confirm the report.

Last week, Russia seized control of the Chernobyl power plant, now shut down and sealed with a containment dome after an infamous disaster in April 1986.

Ukraine's nuclear regulatory agency SNRIU has requested ""immediate assistance"" from the IAEA to ensure the safety of Chernobyl and other nuclear facilities, Grossi said. He said the IAEA is assessing the request.

""Despite the extraordinary circumstances of an armed conflict causing increasing challenges and dangers, Ukraine's nuclear power plants are operating normally,"" Grossi said. ""But while we may use expressions like 'normal operations' in a technical context, I want to emphasize there is nothing normal about the circumstances under which the professionals at Ukraine's four nuclear power plants are managing to keep the reactors that produce half of Ukraine's electricity working.""

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

How you can help: Here are ways those in the U.S. can help support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.

10,4d3da736-f0cc-4fa3-84ce-dfe80c0ce436,[],2022-03-04 00:00:00,"Russian forces have captured Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe, according to regional officials.

Ukrainian authorities said on Friday Russian shelling had caused a fire at a building in the plant complex that was later put out. The blaze raised alarm from leaders worldwide of a potential massive disaster. Russia blamed the attack on Ukrainian saboteurs, calling it a “monstrous provocation”.

Here is what we know so far:

Where is it located?

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is located in the southern Ukraine steppe on the Dnieper River, some 550 kilometres (342 miles) southeast of Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and about 525km (325 miles) south of Chernobyl, the site of the world’s worst nuclear power plant accident in 1986, which has also now been seized by Russian forces.

The plant has a total capacity of about 6,000 megawatts, enough to power about roughly four million homes.

On Wednesday, residents carrying Ukrainian flags had blocked the road to the plant, in an apparent standoff with Russian forces.

What happened?

But on Friday Russian troops were accused of attacking the plant, in an assault Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy branded “nuclear terror” and said could endanger the continent.

A video feed from the plant showed shelling and smoke rising near a building at the plant compound.

The night-time footage showed one building aflame, and a volley of incoming shells, before a large candescent ball lit up the sky, exploding beside a car park and sending smoke billowing across the compound.

The emergency services, in a statement on Facebook, said “the fire in the training building of Zaporizhzhia NPP in Energodar was extinguished” at 06:20 (04:20 GMT).

“There are no victims,” it added.

The Ukraine regulatory authority also said the fire at the site had not affected “essential” equipment and personnel were taking mitigatory actions. They also said there “was no reported change in radiation levels at the plant”.

The mayor of the nearby town of Enerdohar said fierce fighting and “continuous enemy shelling” had caused casualties in the area, without providing details.

Later on Friday, local authorities said Russian military forces had seized the power plant, while operational personnel “were monitoring the condition of power units”.

Is there a radiation danger?

The reactors at the Zaporizhzhia plant operate on fuel enriched with fissile isotope uranium-235.

They work by the core heating steam, but unlike other reactors, the nuclear-contaminated steam is not used to generate energy. Instead, it is used to power another uncontaminated steam circuit which then turns the turbines.

This means that radiation levels for workers at the plant are relatively low.

Background radiation levels around the plant are currently about 0.1 microsieverts per hour, according to the plant’s operator.

That is below the global average of background radiation and much less than flying on an aeroplane or getting an x-ray.

During the Chernobyl disaster, radiation levels were about 300 sieverts per hour, many millions of times higher.

United States energy secretary Jennifer Granholm and The International Atomic Energy Agency also confirmed there were no “elevated radiation readings near the facility”.

“These plants were never designed to be in a warzone and they are not capable of dealing with the vulnerabilities that are inherent with being in a fire zone,” Henry Sokolski, executive director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, told Al Jazeera.

“If they do other military operations either there or in other reactors, something relating to the main power core or the spent fuel pond would release an enormous amount of radioactivity.”

Reactions

Early reports of the incident at the power plant sent financial markets in Asia spiralling, with stocks tumbling and oil prices surging further.

There were quick reactions to the attack. Zelenskyy in a video address called on “Europeans, please wake up. Tell your politicians Russian troops are shooting at a nuclear power plant in Ukraine.”

.@ZelenskyyUa: “Russian army has opened fire on Zaporizhzhia NPP. No state except Russia has ever opened fire at nuclear power units. For the first time in human history, a terrorist state has resorted to nuclear terror. Only immediate European action can stop Russian troops”. — MFA of Ukraine 🇺🇦 (@MFA_Ukraine) March 4, 2022

US President Joe Biden and United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson both spoke with Zelenskyy to get an update on the situation at the plant.

“President Biden joined President Zelenskyy in urging Russia to cease its military activities in the area and allow firefighters and emergency responders to access the site,” the White House said.

.@POTUS also spoke this evening with Under Secretary for Nuclear Security of the U.S. Department of Energy and Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration to receive an update on the situation at the plant. The President will continue to be briefed regularly. — The White House (@WhiteHouse) March 4, 2022

Johnson said Russian forces must immediately quit their attack and agreed with Zelenskyy that a ceasefire was crucial.

“The prime minister said the reckless actions of President Putin could now directly threaten the safety of all of Europe,” Downing Street said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/4/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-attack-all-you-need-to-know
