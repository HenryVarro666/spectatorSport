But strategically, our state wants to have a specific mechanism that will guarantee its security in the future.

Adviser to the President's Office head Mykhailo Podoliak said this in an interview with WP Wiadomości, the press service of the head of state reported.

""The immediate ceasefire and the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from the territories of Ukraine are one of the key aspects of the peace agreement. Otherwise, nothing. However, negotiations are a large-scale process in which not only Russia and Ukraine take part. Our partners are also involved. After all, we do not just have to sign an agreement. We want to develop a specific mechanism that will guarantee our security in the future,"" he stressed.

Podoliak stressed that at the moment the Ukrainian and Russian delegations are defending their positions at the talks, so it may take some time to agree on the controversial issues.

""During this time, we should get closer to concluding a peace agreement. First of all, taking into account the interests of Ukraine, which suffered huge destruction from the Russian Federation,"" he said.

He also expressed confidence that after the signing of such an agreement, Russia will have no choice but to immediately begin the withdrawal of armed forces from the territory of Ukraine. Thus, after the signing of the treaty, the Vienna Convention will come into force for both sides, according to which the peace treaty can be annulled if the belligerent states do not withdraw their troops from enemy territories. Thus, attempts to detain Russian soldiers in Ukraine would be legally unjustified.

Podoliak noted that in order to prevent another violation of international law and treaties by Russia, Ukraine wants to spell out in detail a specific plan in the agreement for the withdrawal of Russian troops, legally verify this, and also get the support of international partners.

""In addition, it is foreign states that will guarantee the fulfillment of the conditions and the security of Ukraine in the future. This will be a document detailing the procedure for actions in the event of repeated aggression from Russia. This is an innovative formula, authored by President Volodymyr Zelensky, which can become the basis for creating a completely new security system in Europe,"" he said.

Podoliak also stressed that Ukraine would not agree to compromises that could damage its interests.

""We are not Russia. We know how and we will conduct a dialogue with our society. And we always hear our society. Unlike the Russian Federation, we can discuss any issues that we should have been talking about for a long time, but we will not agree to a single ultimatum,"" he said.",https://ua.interfax.com.ua/news/general/814949.html

""Immediate ceasefire and immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine is one of the key aspects of the peace agreement. No other way. The negotiations are a large-scale process involving not only Russia and Ukraine. Our partners, including Poland, are also indirectly involved. Because we must not just sign an agreement. We want to develop a concrete mechanism that will guarantee our security in the future. So far, both the Russian and Ukrainian delegations hold their ground. Reconciliation of disputes can take from a few days to a week and a half. During this time, we must move closer to a peace agreement. Taking into account, first of all, the interests of Ukraine, which has suffered enormous destruction from the Russian Federation,"" Mykhailo Podolyak, Adviser to the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, said in an interview with the Wiadomości Polish newspaper, Ukrinform reports.

The Adviser to the Head of the President’s Office stressed that once the peace agreement was concluded, the Russian Federation would have no other choice than to start to withdraw immediately its armed forces from Ukrainian territory. ""Once the agreement is signed, the Vienna Convention will enter into force for both parties. It clearly states that the peace treaty can be annulled if the warring parties do not withdraw their troops from enemy territory. Therefore, any attempts to keep Russian soldiers on Ukrainian territory will be legally unfounded,"" Podolyak argued.

He underscored that in order to ensure the further escalation of the military situation in Ukraine, it is planned to prescribe in detail a specific plan for the withdrawal of Russian troops in the final document. ""To legally verify it and get the support of our partners. In addition, it is foreign countries that will guarantee compliance with the conditions and security of Ukraine in the future. This will be a document that describes in detail the procedure in case of repeated aggression by Russia,"" said the Adviser.

The representative of the President’s Office noted that this was an innovative formula, authored by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky, which might underpin a completely new security system in Europe.

In addition, Podolyak stated that Ukraine's position in negotiations with Russia on the occupied territories remains unchanged – it is impossible to change the country's borders. ""However, I believe that we must be realistic in our judgments. De jure, Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk remain the part of Ukraine, but we do not control them de facto, the Russian administration works there. One of the key issues is how to manage these territories. The problem is that the Russian Federation came to us with the war, not started a conversation,"" he added.

Asked whether the possibility of restoration of Ukraine’s control over Donetsk and Luhansk is considered, Podolyak noted that negotiations are underway, as well as the search for a legal formula. ""Once it is found, the presidents of Ukraine and Russia will continue negotiations at a special meeting,"" he added.

At the same time, the Adviser to the Head of the President’s Office expressed the opinion that the signing of a peace treaty by the parties can only end the acute phase of the conflict. However, he expressed doubts that this would be the end of the war for Ukrainians and stated that Russia had no chance to prove that anyone but it was to blame for this large-scale catastrophe.

On February 24, Russian president Vladimir Putin announced the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine. Russian troops destroy key infrastructure, massively shell residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, and ballistic missiles.

Martial law was imposed in Ukraine and general mobilization was announced. Ukraine repels Russian invaders.

In his opinion, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has shown that the entire architecture of European security must be revised. That is why our state wants to end this war with a new coalition, so powerful that it will stop Russia if it wants to attack someone again.

Theoretically, now is the time to speak publicly about all aspects of modern challenges and openly assess the level of modern security contours. Do they cope with these challenges? Can they protect European cities from the barbaric bombings that Ukraine is experiencing today? Will Europe be able to finally get rid of the fear of the Russian Federation? It is obvious that the countries that will be the new guarantors of security will undertake certain commitments.

The mounting death toll in Ukraine has forced President Volodymyr Zelensky to consider concessions to Russia in order to bring an end to the devastating conflict, but the specific elements of any peace deal his government may be discussing with Moscow remain a mystery to Western leaders, said U.S. and European officials.

The secretive rounds of meetings between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators could hold the key to ending the conflict but also carry broader implications for European security depending on how the warring parties settle their differences. If Russian President Vladimir Putin can use military force to compel political change in Ukraine, he could use the same tactic elsewhere, U.S. and European officials fear.

The prospects of a near-term deal look bleak, diplomats say, but mixed signals from Zelensky about how close he is to striking an agreement have only heightened anxiety about the trajectory of the negotiations.

Russia has sought to pummel Ukraine into submission through artillery barrages, cruise missile strikes and a severing of supply routes that have prompted a humanitarian disaster and forced more than 3 million people to flee the country.

Zelensky, however, has remained defiant, saying his country wants peace — but not at any cost.

“I’m ready for dialogue; we’re not ready for capitulation,” Zelensky told ABC News earlier this week, while vowing to continue fighting Russia for as long as necessary.

Zelensky reiterated that message in even stronger terms on Tuesday when the prime ministers of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia traveled to Kyiv to meet him in a risky wartime visit. “He showed very little interest in a negotiated settlement and said Ukraine needed to keep fighting until Putin altered his demands,” said a diplomat familiar with the discussions, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive meetings.

At the same time, Zelensky’s top negotiator, Mykhailo Podolyak, has hailed progress in negotiations with Russia and suggested a quick end to the fighting. “Their position has softened significantly,” Podolyak told PBS this week in reference to Russia. “We have much confidence that we will have a cease-fire in the coming days.”

The conflicting forecasts have led to some confusion among Western leaders who see limited movement toward reconciling Russia’s demands with what Ukraine would find acceptable. Moscow has called for the full demilitarization of Ukraine and for Kyiv to recognize the Crimean Peninsula, annexed by Moscow in 2014, as Russian territory and the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent countries. Moscow has also called for the “de-Nazification” of Ukraine, a Kremlin term believed to mean the dissolution of the Zelensky government. Ukrainian officials have said all four demands are non-starters but have been open to discussing the issue of neutrality and the country’s relationship to NATO.

“There’s no indication on our end that the Ukrainians are suing for peace. They want to fight,” said a senior U.S. official.

When asked to account for some of Ukraine’s optimistic messaging about a deal, the official said “we’ve been puzzling over this too. We’ve been getting mixed messages.”

A second U.S. administration official said Ukraine’s statements suggest that Zelensky and his top aides haven’t come to a firm conclusion on what the Ukrainian people are willing to concede in exchange for a cease-fire and withdrawal of Russian troops.

“They just haven’t come up with a decision yet,” added a senior European official.

Others close to Zelensky say he is under extraordinary pressure to convey progress in negotiations with Russia even if the reality is less sanguine.

“Many Ukrainians are now suffering enormously. That puts our delegation under pressure to show some kind of progress in the talks,” said Yuri Vitrenko, the CEO of Naftogaz, the country’s largest state-owned oil and gas company.

“There are people in Ukraine who say ‘we don’t want to hear about talks, we want to fight until the end.’ But others are saying ‘at least try to negotiate.’ That’s why for the negotiating team, it’s important to be constructive,” he said.

The Ukrainian Embassy in Washington declined to comment.

Speculation about an emerging peace deal surged on Wednesday following a report in the Financial Times that Ukrainian and Russian negotiators discussed a 15-point draft on Monday that would see Kyiv renouncing its ambitions to join NATO and swear off hosting foreign military bases or weaponry in exchange for security guarantees from countries such as Britain, the United States or Turkey.

That same day, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Ukraine’s “neutral status is now being seriously discussed” and said the two sides “are close to agreeing.” A day earlier, Zelensky said Ukrainians “must admit” that the West has indicated Ukraine won’t be a member of NATO — remarks that seemed designed to prepare the Ukrainian people for concessions.

But officials from Russia and Ukraine later denied that the 15-point plan represented a possible solution, and Ukrainian officials said most of the reported document was merely a restatement of Russian positions.

Zelensky will have to sell any peace deal to his own people — a tricky task if he is forced to concede too much. He has been a wildly popular wartime president, but he was an unpopular peacetime one. And Ukraine’s westward ambitions have only been strengthened by Russia’s assault. Before February, many residents of cities like Kharkiv were sympathetic to Russia. Now much of the city has been reduced to rubble, and pro-Russian voices have turned into fiercely pro-Kyiv ones.

Any potential deal will also require buy-in from the West, which will need to lift sanctions on Moscow in exchange for its withdrawal of Russian forces.

But Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that a simple withdrawal of troops may not meet a U.S. standard for sanctions relief. The United States “will want to make sure that anything that’s done is, in effect, irreversible, that this can’t happen again, that Russia won’t pick up and do exactly what it’s doing in a year or two years or three years.”

Some eastern flank NATO members also oppose a peace agreement that concedes too much to Putin for fear of the message it would send about violations of sovereignty and international law.

“If at the end of this, Putin comes away with anything but a clearly defined loss for him, that would destabilize European and international security unlike anything we’ve seen since the days of the Second World War,” said Jonatan Vseviov, the secretary general of the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

But the desire to have Putin feel defeated could also make a middle-ground compromise impossible, officials acknowledged, spurring the Russian leader to keep fighting. European countries would be unlikely to roll back sanctions at the first sign of a peace deal but would wait until there are concrete signs it is actually being implemented and respected, a senior European diplomat said.

A middle path could be possible, involving Ukraine setting aside its ambitions to join NATO in exchange for the integration of the separatist eastern Ukrainian territories back into Kyiv-controlled Ukraine.

“The question is if Putin is capable of agreeing on what many will see as defeat,” said a European diplomat.

Even if Zelensky manages to strike a deal, implementing it could be difficult. Ukraine’s NATO aspirations were baked into its constitution in a 2019 amendment, and changing it again would require a lengthy process that culminates in a supermajority vote of parliament. Not all political forces in the country are ready to do that, and a supermajority isn’t a sure bet, said Alex Riabchyn, a former lawmaker who voted in favor of the 2019 change.

The other challenge, Riabchyn said, is that Zelensky has proved so powerful a wartime communicator that Ukrainians are united behind him, with high morale and a willingness to keep fighting. A deal that seems like a defeat might not be acceptable to Ukrainian society.

“Ukrainians believe we are winning this war, so they might not accept painful compromises,” said Riabchyn, who now advises the government. “They might feel this is a betrayal. Zelensky raised the aspiration lines very high.”

For now, U.S. and European officials say they do not see signs that Russia is stopping its attack. One key measure, officials said, was whether Russian troops were digging defensive lines to solidify control of the territory they have captured. That hasn’t started yet, signifying a likely intent to keep pushing forward, two defense officials said.

Russia’s public optimism about a deal is a source of interest for diplomats. Officials familiar with the negotiations attribute it to one of two strategies. One is that Moscow is serious because the Kremlin wants to roll back existing sanctions. The other is that Russia wants to create the impression of seriousness in a bid to head off even more sanctions.

Vitrenko, the Naftogaz executive, subscribes to the latter.

“Russians are now making this impression that there is progress with negotiations for a very obvious reason: they don’t want the West to impose tougher sanctions.”

Ultimately, what Ukraine will agree to, lies with Zelensky because of the way he has emerged as a figure of unity.

“It’s Zelensky who decides,” he said. “It’s about the spirit of a nation. Thousands of Ukrainians are dying. He’s a wartime leader and it’s a huge responsibility.”

Since launching the assault on 24 February, Russian troops facing tough resistance have largely stalled in their advance, even as they encroach on the capital Kyiv. Looking to regain momentum, they have laid siege to cities and blasted urban areas to rubble.

Russia bogged down, blasting Ukrainian cities as war enters fourth week Russian forces in Ukraine are blasting cities and killing civilians but no longer making progress on the ground, Western countries said on Thursday, as a war Moscow was thought to have hoped to win within days entered its fourth week.

Air raid sirens sounded early on Saturday in the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Zhytomyr regions, but there were no immediate reports of fresh attacks.

The governor of the eastern region of Luhansk, bordering Russia, said there would be a ceasefire on Saturday morning and a humanitarian corridor for evacuations will be opened.

“A ‘regime of silence’ has been agreed for 19 March, starting at 9 a.m.” (0700 GMT), said Governor Serhiy Gaidai in a message on Telegram. Luhansk lies in Ukraine’s coal-rich Donbass region that has been partly controlled by Russia-backed separatists since 2014.

Gaidai, the head of the Ukrainian administration in Luhansk, has said 59 civilians have been killed in the region since the start of the war.

Unprecedented Western sanctions aimed at isolating Russia’s economy have done little to halt what President Vladimir Putin calls a “special operation” to reduce its neighbour’s military capabilities and “denazify” its government.

After Russia said it was “tightening the noose” around the key port of Mariupol, Ukraine’s defence ministry acknowledged on Friday it had “temporarily” lost access to the Azov Sea, which connects to the Black Sea and would be a major loss for Ukraine.

But Western officials say Russia has taken heavy losses with signs of flagging morale among its troops, a trend Zelenskyy alluded to in a video message in which he urged renewed negotiations to end the war.

“I want everyone to hear me now, especially in Moscow. The time has come for a meeting, it is time to talk,” he said early on Saturday. “The time has come to restore territorial integrity and justice for Ukraine. Otherwise, Russia’s losses will be such that it will take you several generations to recover.”

Russia acknowledged on 2 March that nearly 500 of its soldiers had been killed but has given no update since. Ukraine says the number now amounts to many thousands. Reuters could not independently verify the death count.

Kyiv and Moscow reported some progress in talks this week towards a political formula that would guarantee Ukraine security protection outside of the NATO alliance.

Ukraine and Russia make progress on plan to end war A fifteen-point draft deal between Russia and Ukraine, reported by the Financial Times on Wednesday (16 March), would involve Kyiv renouncing NATO membership ambitions and accepting territorial changes, in return for security guarantees.

But Ukraine said the need for an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal of Russian troops remained, and each side accused the other of dragging out the talks.

Putin has vowed to continue the invasion until it succeeds, promising tens of thousands of people waving Russian flags at a soccer stadium in Moscow on Friday that Russia “will absolutely accomplish all of our plans.”

The United States has repeatedly warned that Russia may turn for assistance to China, the biggest power that has not condemned the assault.

In a video call on Friday, President Joe Biden told China’s President Xi Jinping there would be “consequences” if Beijing provides “material support” to Russia in Ukraine, the White House said. It said sanctioning Beijing was an option.

US warns China not to fuel Russia's assault on Ukraine as fears for Mariupol grow US President Joe Biden warned China against helping Russia attack Ukraine in a video call with President Xi Jinping on Friday (18 March) as concern grew over mass civilian casualties in the besieged southern port of Mariupol.

China and Russia deny Beijing is considering giving Moscow military aid. China says it wants to see an end to the conflict.

Fleeing for cover

US oilfield services companies Halliburton Co and Schlumberger said on Friday they have suspended or halted Russia operations in response to US sanctions over Moscow’s invasion.

Russia, among the world’s largest oil and gas producers, exports 7 million to 8 million barrels per day of crude and oil products. BP PLC, Shell, Equinor ASA and Exxon Mobil have suspended business or announced plans to exit their Russia operations.

In the fourth week of their land, sea and air assault, Russian forces have not captured any big cities and Ukraine’s elected government remains defiant in the capital.

Fleeing bombardment that Ukraine says has struck housing blocks, schools, hospitals and cultural facilities, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians had left for of Lviv in western Ukraine, far from the frontline in the country’s east.

Three missiles landed at an airport near Lviv on Friday, raising fears the city could come under a deeper assault.

Civilians sheltering in eastern Ukrainian cities have had to endure cuts to electricity, heating and water, with food and other vital resources increasingly scarce. More than 3 million refugees have fled over Ukraine’s western border.

Some of the heaviest fighting has been in Mariupol, where some 400,000 people have been trapped for over two weeks. Officials there say fighting has reached the city centre and that near-constant shelling was preventing humanitarian aid from getting in.

Rescue workers were still searching for survivors of a Mariupol theatre flattened by Russian air strikes on Wednesday. Russia denies hitting the theatre.

In his video address, Zelenskyy said there was no information about how many people had died in the theatre, where hundreds had been sheltering. More than 130 people had been rescued, he said.

Humanitarian corridors

As people continue trying to flee through “humanitarian corridors” arranged by Ukrainian and Russian officials, the World Food Programme has warned that food supply chains in the country are collapsing.

Key infrastructure such as bridges and trains have been destroyed by bombs and many grocery stores and warehouses are empty, said Jacob Kern, WFP emergency coordinator for the Ukraine crisis.

“Inside Ukraine our job is in effect to replace the broken commercial food supply chains,” he said, calling this a “mammoth task”.

Ukraine hopes to evacuate civilians on Saturday via ten humanitarian corridors from cities and towns on the front line of fighting with Russian forces, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on Saturday.

She said a corridor had been agreed for the besieged city of Mariupol, although the authorities’ previous efforts to evacuate civilians there under a temporary ceasefire have mostly failed, with both sides trading blame.",https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/meaningful-talks-needed-to-stop-russia-in-ukraine-zelenskyy-says/
