“We really need support,” Mayor Andriy Sadovyi says.

More than 200,000 Ukrainians displaced from their homes are now in Lviv, filling up sport halls, schools, hospitals and church buildings. The historical city once popular with tourists had a population of 700,000 before the war.

Last week, Sadovyi told The Times of Israel that the city had prepared well to deal with the tens of thousands of refugees flowing through the city at that time, but would be stretched if the number of fleeing civilians that needed support reached 200,000.

The mayor says the city needs big tents equipped with kitchens so food can be prepared.

Hundreds of thousands more people could arrive if humanitarian corridors are opened up from cities now under siege from Russian troops.

The embassies of the US, Israel and EU countries also moved to Lviv from Kyiv before the invasion.

Lviv is the main transit point for those fleeing just across the border to Poland. Many of the 1.7 million Ukrainians now abroad passed through the city. The United Nations has called the situation the fastest growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.

Speaking to a packed House of Commons via video link, Mr Zelensky also echoed William Shakespeare as he said the question facing Ukraine was “to be or not to be”.

The emotional address, which saw at least one MP watching on in tears, was met with a rare standing ovation and applause both before and after the address from parliamentarians.

During the speech Mr Zelensky also hinted at his previous call for a no fly zone above Ukraine, urging UK help to ensure the “skies are safe”, and called for tougher sanctions. Boris Johnson, who sat listening via a headset translating the speech into English alongside scores of other MPs, responded by saying Mr Zelensky was “standing firm for democracy and for freedom”.

In one of the emotive sections of the speech, Mr Zelensky said: ""The question for us now is to be or not to be. Oh no, this Shakespearean question.

""For 13 days this question could have been asked but now I can give you a definitive answer. It's definitely yes, to be. ""And I would like to remind you [of] the words that the United Kingdom have already heard, which are important again. We will not give up and we will not lose.""

“We will fight till the end, at sea, in the air, we will continue fighting for our land. Whatever the cost. We will fight in the forests, in the fields, on the shores, in the streets.

“I would like to add that we will fight on the banks of different rivers like Dnieper, and we are looking for your help, for the help of the civilised countries.”",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/03/08/russia-ukraine-news-war-live-putin-peace-nato-latest/

Kyiv wakes up to air raid sirens

Kyiv residents awoke Wednesday to an air raid alert urging them to get to bomb shelters as quickly as possible over fears of incoming Russian missiles.

Kyiv regional administration head Oleksiy Kuleba issued the air raid alert saying there was a “threat of a missile attack” on the Ukrainian capital. “Everyone immediately to shelters,” he said, later lifting the alert as the all-clear was given.

Air raid alerts are common, though irregular, keeping people on edge. Kyiv has been relatively quiet in recent days, though Russian artillery has pounded the outskirts.

Kuleba said the crisis for civilians was growing in the capital, with the situation particularly critical in the city’s suburbs.

“Russia is artificially creating a humanitarian crisis in the Kyiv region, frustrating the evacuation of people and continuing shelling and bombing small communities,” he said.

Ukraine’s air defences having success against Russian jets, U.K. says

Britain on Wednesday said Ukraine’s air defences were having success against Russian jets, likely preventing Russia from controlling the airspace.

“Ukrainian air defences appear to have enjoyed considerable success against Russia’s modern combat aircraft, probably preventing them achieving any degree of control of the air,” the Ministry of Defence intelligence update posted on Twitter said.

Britain’s assessment also said Russian forces had failed to make any significant breakthroughs in fighting north west of Kyiv.

Harris to face questions around Polish fighter jet deal

Vice President Kamala Harris’ trip to Warsaw to thank Poland for taking in hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians fleeing Russia’s invasion took an unexpected turn before she even left Washington. She’ll be parachuting into the middle of unexpected diplomatic turbulence over fighter jets.

The Polish government on Tuesday came out with a plan to transfer its Russian-made fighter planes to a U.S. military base in Germany, with the expectation that the planes would then be handed over to Ukrainian pilots trying to fend off Russian forces. In turn, the U.S. would supply Poland with U.S.-made jets with “corresponding capabilities.”

But the Poles didn’t run that idea past the Biden administration before going public with it, and the Pentagon quickly dismissed the idea as “not tenable.”

And it meant Harris was flying into fractious terrain Wednesday as she opens a two-day visit to Poland and Romania and tries to patch things up.

Staff at attacked nuclear plant to become propaganda tools, Ukraine says

Ukraine’s energy minister said Russian forces that now control a Ukrainian nuclear plant are forcing the exhausted staff to record an address that they plan to use for propaganda purposes.

Russian troops have been in control of the Zaporizhzhia plant, the largest in Europe, since seizing it an attack on Friday that set a building on fire and raised fears of a nuclear disaster. It was later determined that no radiation was released.

Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said on Facebook that about 500 Russian soldiers and 50 pieces of heavy equipment are inside the station. He said the Ukrainian staff are “physical and emotionally exhausted.”

Russia describes the war as a “special military operation” and says it is conducting targeted attacks. Halushchenko’s reference to propaganda appears to refer to Russian efforts to show it is not endangering Ukrainian civilians or infrastructure.

Russia to extend humanitarian corridors Wednesday

Russia said it is ready to provide humanitarian corridors on Wednesday for people fleeing Kyiv and four other Ukrainian cities, as the number of refugees created by the biggest assault on a European country since World War Two surpassed 2 million.

Mikhail Mizintsev, head of Russia’s National Defence Control Centre, was quoted as saying by the Tass news agency that Russian forces would “observe a regime of silence” from 10 a.m. Moscow time to ensure safe passage for civilians wishing to leave Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol.

It was unclear if the proposed routes would pass through Russia or Belarus, conditions previously opposed by the Ukrainian government.

Ukrainian authorities said ceasefire violations once again scuttled attempts to evacuate Mariupol, the city on the Sea of Azov that has been surrounded by Russian troops.

Ambulances in Ukraine have become targets in Russian invasion, say medical personnel

Across Ukraine, medical personnel say ambulances have become targets in a Russian invasion that has fired artillery shells on kindergartens, bombs on apartment blocks and mortars into civilians. On Tuesday, Russian troops near Mykolaiv fired at a minivan emblazoned with red cross markings. Inside were staff travelling to work at a local orphanage. Three women died, Ganna Zamazeeva, head of the Mykolayiv Regional Council, wrote in an impassioned post on Telegram.

“Every day, on the instructions of their Fuhrer, Russian troops commit crimes against humanity on our land,” she wrote.

Ukraine’s medical system has experienced other serious strains in the war. Sixty-one of the country’s hospitals have been knocked out by attacks, Health Minister Viktor Lyashko said Tuesday. He blamed “terrorists from the aggressor country.”

Russia denies taking aim at civilians, in the face of ample documentary evidence to the contrary.

McDonald’s, Coca-Cola, Starbucks join consumer giants suspending business in Russia

McDonald’s Corp., Starbucks Corp., The Coca-Cola Co., PepsiCo Inc. and packaged-goods giant Unilever PLC are suspending operations in Russia.

McDonald’s, which opened its first location in the Soviet Union on downtown Moscow’s Pushkin Square in 1990, announced that it would temporarily close 847 locations in Russia. The company said it will continue to pay the salaries of the roughly 62,000 people it employs.

Unilever, which owns hundreds of brands including Dove and Knorr, suspended imports and exports of its products in Russia, and cut off advertising spending there, but did not fully halt operations.

Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Starbucks all announced they would suspend their business operations in Russia, though PepsiCo said it would continue to sell essentials such as milk, baby formula and baby food. Read full story.

Women make up vast majority of Ukrainian war refugees in Poland

Shortly after Natali Ticegko crossed the border into Poland from Ukraine on Tuesday, someone gave her a bouquet of pink roses in honour of International Women’s Day. She appreciated the gesture and in normal times, she’d join in the celebration. But not now.

Ms. Ticegko, 30, left her husband in Donetsk and she has no idea if he’s dead or alive. “This day for me, it doesn’t matter,” she said as she clutched her five-year-old son. As she waited to register at a refugee shelter in the Polish border town of Krowica Sama, she scrolled through photos of her husband and came close to tears with the flick of each picture. “I don’t care about women’s day this year, maybe after the war.”

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine brought new meaning to International Women’s Day, given the scale of the conflict and the mass of refugees fleeing for safety.

The Ukrainian government’s decision to ban men aged 18 to 60 from leaving the country has meant that the vast majority of the two million people who have fled the fighting have been women.

Pentagon says Poland’s jet offer for Ukraine ‘not tenable’

Poland’s offer to give its MiG-29 fighter jets to the U.S. so they can be passed to Ukraine raises serious concerns for the NATO alliance and the plan is not “a tenable one,” Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said in a statement.

The prospect of jets departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace contested with Russia in the Ukraine war is concerning and the U.S., Kirby said, will continue to talk to Poland about the matter.

Ukraine has been pleading for more warplanes and Washington has been looking at a proposal under which Poland would supply Ukraine with Soviet-era fighters and in turn receive American F-16s to make up for their loss.

A transfer of the MIGs to Ukraine is fraught with complications as neither NATO nor the European Union want to be seen as directly involved in the transaction, which will significantly raise already extreme tensions with Russia. The U.S. has no plan to directly transfer the planes to Ukraine.

Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said any decision about delivering offensive weapons must be made unanimously by NATO members.

‍Russian warplanes carry out new strikes on residential areas

Ukrainian officials said that that two people, including a seven-year-old child, were killed in the town of Chuhuiv just east of Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine late Tuesday. And in the city of Malyn in the Zhytomyr region west of the capital Kyiv at least five people, including two children, were killed in a Russian air strike.

The Russian artillery has pounded the outskirts of Kyiv, forcing civilians to hide in shelters while water, food and power supplies have been cut, said Yaroslav Moskalenko, an official who coordinates humanitarian efforts in the Kyiv region.

He said that the shelling made it impossible to evacuate the bodies of five people who died when their vehicle was fired upon in Borodianka near Kyiv and the bodies of 12 patients of a psychiatric hospital there. He said that another 200 patients were stuck there without food and medicines.

‍Fitch cuts Russia’s rating, says debt default imminent

Fitch Ratings Inc., one of the big three U.S. credit rating agencies, downgraded Russia’s sovereign rating by six notches further into the junk territory to ‘C’ from ‘B’, saying a default is imminent as sanctions and trade restrictions have undermined its willingness to service debt.

The rating firm pointed to Presidential decree, which could potentially force a redenomination of foreign-currency sovereign debt payments into local currency for creditors in specified countries.

“‍Further ratcheting up of sanctions and proposals that could limit trade in energy increase probability of a policy response by Russia that includes at least selective non-payment of its sovereign debt obligations,” the ratings agency said in a statement.

On March 16, Russia is due to pay $107 million in coupons across two bonds, though it has a 30-day grace period to make the payments.

The ‘C’ rating in Fitch’s assessment is only one step above default, bringing it in line with the Moody’s current equivalent score of ‘Ca’.

Ukrainian children with cancer escape to Poland in complex rescue mission

A mother and her two-year-old child undergoing treatment for leukemia are among dozens of young cancer patients that escaped across the Ukrainian border into Poland on March 8. Video obtained by The Globe and Mail showed Yana Vorobyova and her son Nikita in the basement of the Chernihiv Regional Children’s Hospital on March 4, where they had been sheltering since the Russian invasion began. The Globe and Mail

In one of the most complicated evacuations likely ever managed from a war zone, 73 Ukrainian children suffering from cancer were rescued from besieged cities around the country and driven across the border into Poland on Tuesday.

The sick kids – along with their mothers and siblings, 173 people in all – reached the border in a police-escorted convoy of four buses and seven ambulances. The majority had been evacuated from the main children’s hospital in Kyiv, the war-battered capital, while others had been rescued from increasingly dire situations in front-line cities such Zaporizhia, Odesa, Mykolayiv and Chernihiv.

The eight children and their moms from Chernihiv had been in particular distress, having spent most of the previous 12 days hiding in a basement bomb shelter as the Chernihiv Regional Children’s Hospital ran dangerously low on food and medicines, including painkillers, while Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces bombarded the city.

“It’s sad that we have to leave Ukraine, but there is no choice because the children must finish their treatment,” said Yana Vorobyova, the mother of two-year-old Nikita, who suffers from acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Ms. Vorobyova spoke to The Globe by phone as the emergency convoy approached the Rava-Ruska crossing to Poland. A few minutes later, she and Nikita smiled and waved farewell as the yellow school bus they were travelling in passed under the last Ukrainian flag before the border. Read full story.

UNESCO moves to protect Ukraine’s heritage sites

The United Nations’ cultural agency (UNESCO) said it had bolstered protective measures to preserve Ukraine’s endangered cultural heritage, noting Saint Sophia Cathedral in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv and related monastic buildings a priority.

To avoid deliberate or accidental damages, the agency is marking cultural sites and monuments in Ukraine with the distinctive “Blue Shield” emblem of the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict.

“The marking with the emblem of the Convention also comes from the fact that Russia and Ukraine are two countries to have ratified this important convention,” Lazare Eloundou Assomo, the director of the UNESCO World Heritage Centre, told Reuters.

Partnering with the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR), the agency assesses damage by analyzing satellite imagery for priority sites which are endangered or already impacted. A dozen such sites are already covered by the monitoring system, according to the UNESCO statement.

Poland is ready to deploy all its MIG-29 jets to Rammstein Air Base in Germany and put them at the disposal of the United States, and urges other NATO members that own planes of that type to do the same, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.

U.S. lawmakers pushed President Joe Biden’s administration on Monday to facilitate the transfer of fighter aircraft to Ukraine from Poland and other NATO and Eastern European countries, after a plea on Saturday from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

“The authorities of the Republic of Poland … are ready to deploy – immediately and free of charge – all their MIG-29 jets to the Rammstein Air Base and place them at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America,” the ministry said.

“At the same time, Poland requests the United States to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities. Poland is ready to immediately establish the conditions of purchase of the planes,” it added.

Analysis: Biden’s ban on Russian oil imports will push Moscow closer to Beijing and strengthen China

Isaac Newton’s third law of motion said that, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. The same might be said about economic sanctions.

If Russia can’t sell its oil and natural gas to the United States, it will turn east and sell them to China. That market switch is already under way. Beijing probably has already concluded that the war in Ukraine might do more good than harm to the Chinese economy. Last week, it hedged is geo-economic bets by declining to condemn Russia in the UN’s general assembly vote – it abstained. Read full story.

President Zelensky appeals to Britain: Help fight Russia and punish ‘terrorist state’

In a video speech laced with frustration and desperation, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the British Parliament on Tuesday, calling for the U.K. to recognize Russia as a terrorist state, and to increase sanctions pressure on the Russian regime.

“We are looking for the help of civilized countries. Please make sure you do what needs to be done,” he said, in the historic address to the House of Commons and House of Lords.

Mr. Zelensky’s speech lasted about 10 minutes, where he went into detail about the experiences of Ukrainians over the last 13 days, saying that the country is facing a severe water shortage amid hospitals being hit and children being killed. “We do not want to lose what we have, what is ours. Just the same way as you didn’t want to lose your country and you had to fight for Britain,” he told British lawmakers.

On Monday, the government rushed through a bill intended to target Russian oligarchs and stem the flow of “dirty” money into the London property market. The Economic Crime Bill, which is expected to achieve Royal Assent this week, forces foreign owners of U.K. property to declare and verify their identities as “beneficial” owners, so as to not allow them to hide behind shell companies or trusts.

Anti-corruption activists and members of the opposition have long voiced concern over how London has become a playground for wealthy Russian elite with ties to the Kremlin, frequently accusing Johnson’s Conservatives of not doing enough to crack down on ill-gotten money. The anti-corruption non-profit Transparency International estimates that there is approximately $2.5-billion worth of property in London owned by Russians with ties to the Kremlin.

In his speech, however, Mr. Zelensky thanked Mr. Johnson for tightening sanctions against wealthy Russians.

The U.K. Prime Minister promised to continue supply weapons to Ukraine. On Tuesday, both the U.S. and the U.K. announced that they would stop importing Russian oil, in response to the Russian invasion. Kwasi Kwarteng, Britain’s secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy said in a statement that Russian imports make up just eight per cent of U.K. oil demand, and the phase-out of Russian oil will take place by the end of 2022.

President Biden bans U.S. imports of Russian oil and gas

U.S. President Joe Biden is banning imports of Russian oil and gas to punish President Vladimir Putin for his invasion of Ukraine, a week after Canada imposed a similar ban and amid mounting congressional pressure on Mr. Biden to act.

Russia supplied only about eight per cent of the U.S.’s petroleum imports last year – an average of 200,00 barrels per day of crude oil and 500,000 of refined products – but Mr. Biden was reluctant to enact a ban for fear of pushing gas prices higher for American consumers.

While Republican politicians have called for more drilling and fracking in the U.S., White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Monday that Mr. Biden will not reverse his ban on new drilling permits on federal land. She also said the President would not rescind his cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline. The line, which was planned to carry Canadian oil to U.S. refineries, was cancelled on Mr. Biden’s first day in office after becoming a flashpoint between environmental groups and fossil fuel companies.

Putin’s siege of Grozny in 2000 gives Ukraine a dark foreshadowing of Kyiv’s future

With mounting fears of urban warfare as Russian forces advance toward the outskirts of Kyiv, analysts are beginning to draw lessons from President Vladimir Putin’s brutal tactics in his first siege of a European city: the Chechen capital of Grozny.

The battle of Grozny was a horrific four-month bombardment that nearly obliterated the city, killing thousands of people in indiscriminate shelling in the winter of 1999-2000. The Russian military fired massive barrages at the city, using long-range heavy artillery, tanks, multiple-rocket launchers, warplanes, cluster bombs and even ballistic missiles. Read full story.

Russian oligarch’s ties to WestJet takeover of Sunwing seen as risk to deal

Steel magnate Alexei Mordashov, known as Russia’s richest man with a fortune worth US$29-billion, has been sanctioned in Europe for his ties to the Kremlin and businesses that support the war against Ukraine. He’s also in line to be an indirect shareholder in Onex Corp.’s WestJet Group, should the Toronto investment company’s proposed takeover of Sunwing Travel Group go ahead.

Mr. Mordashov owns one-third of German travel company TUI AG, which owns 49-per-cent of Sunwing and will become a part owner of the Onex subsidiary, according to the takeover deal the WestJet and Sunwing announced last week. Read full story.

The United Nations human rights office said on Tuesday that it had verified 1,335 civilian casualties in Ukraine, including 474 killed and 861 injured, since Russia’s invasion began on Feb. 24.

But the civilian toll was incomplete pending corroboration of reports, it said in a statement: “This concerns, for example, the towns of Volnovakha, Mariupol, Izium where there are allegations of hundreds of civilian casualties.”

Its previous death toll for civilians killed, issued on Monday, was 406 civilians.

U.S. to ban Russian oil imports over Ukraine invasion

U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to ban imports of Russian oil to punish President Vladimir Putin for his invasion of Ukraine, the Associated Press reported Tuesday. The move comes a week after Canada enacted a similar ban and amid mounting congressional pressure on Mr. Biden to act.

The President scheduled a last-minute announcement for Tuesday morning at the White House to unveil “actions to continue to hold Russia accountable.” The Associated Press, citing an unnamed source, said this would be the oil ban. Chris Coons, a Delaware senator close to Mr. Biden, said on CNN that the President had decided to enact a ban. Read full story.

Eight of the children who were trapped in the cancer ward of the main hospital in the besieged Ukrainian city of Chernihiv have now been evacuated along with their parents and doctors to Poland.

The dramatic escape of the sick kids – who spent most of the first 12 days of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine taking cover in a basement under the Chernihiv Regional Children’s Hospital – started on Sunday when staff at the hospital decided to take the last open road out of the city before it was completely surrounded.

“It was really scary, but it was the only opportunity to escape,” said Serhey Zosimenko, the director of Evum, a non-profit organization that supports the cancer ward. Read full story.

Trudeau denounces ‘Putin’s mistake’ in attacking Ukraine, affirms Canada’s support in eastern Europe

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will meet with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in Latvia on Tuesday as he tours through eastern Europe and pledges Canada’s support for the countries on the frontlines with Russia.

“Putin’s mistake in underestimating the Ukrainians, and also underestimating how resolved we all are to stand up and defend our society - the principles that make us free and successful, is something to behold,” Mr. Trudeau said in Riga on Tuesday at the beginning of a meeting with Latvian Prime Minister Krisjanis Karins.

The gathering was the first of a suite of meetings with eastern European leaders Tuesday as Mr. Trudeau travels through Europe in an effort to show solidarity with the countries on the frontlines with Russia. Anxieties are higher in the small Baltic states that are wedged in the northeast corner of Europe’s border with Russia, something Mr. Trudeau acknowledged. Read full story.

Ukrainians flee some besieged areas through ‘humanitarian corridors’

Ukrainian civilians began leaving two besieged areas on Tuesday after Russia opened “humanitarian corridors” for them, but Kyiv said Russian forces had shelled an evacuation route from the port city of Mariupol.

Soon after residents began leaving the northeastern city of Sumy and the town of Irpin near the capital Kyiv, foreign ministry spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko reported shelling near Mariupol.

“Ceasefire violated! Russian forces are now shelling the humanitarian corridor from (nearby) Zaporizhzhia to Mariupol,” NIkolenko wrote on Twitter.

“8 trucks + 30 buses ready to deliver humanitarian aid to Mariupol and to evac (evacuate) civilians to (nearby) Zaporizhzhia. Pressure on Russia MUST step up to make it uphold its commitments.”

There were no immediate reports of any casualties and Nikolenko gave no other details. Russia did not immediately comment on Nikolenko’s remarks.

Civilians have been trapped by fighting since Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, and officials say food, water and other supplies have been running low in some cities.

Humanitarian corridors from Mariupol failed on Saturday and Sunday, with each side accusing the other of continuing to fire.

Russia’s invasion spurs new rush to fortify NATO’s neglected eastern flank

A scrambled military deployment to the eastern borders of the European Union is being assembled on ground that bears the unmistakable look of neglect. Not far from newly arrived Dutch soldiers walking on muddy gravel at Mihail Kogalniceanu, a Romanian air base near the Black Sea, mouldering Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets sit parked amid the trees.

The base still boasts a bunker built under Nicolae Ceausescu, though dirt has now slumped into the entrances and concrete is peeling from the ceiling. It offers, in any event, little protection against modern munitions, like those being used by Russian troops in Ukraine not far from here, in a war that has underscored the need for stronger military defences in eastern Europe.

But a plan to build a more modern base will take years, Romanian officials say, even in a place that occupies strategic ground for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Read full story

Russia has asserted the right to inflict new damage on Europe by shutting off flows of natural gas, even as Moscow made new promises to allow people to leave the cities it continues to bombard – including Sumy, which was struck by 500-kilogram bombs Monday night, killing at least 18 civilians.

Two of the dead were children, the Ukrainian government said Monday.

Russia pledged that its guns and artillery would go silent around the cities of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol on Tuesday, allowing people to leave places that have been under heavy shelling, starved of water and electricity. Read full story.

UN says number of refugees fleeing Ukraine reaches 2 million

The number of refugees fleeing Ukraine reached 2 million on Tuesday, according to the United Nations, the fastest exodus Europe has seen since World War II.

“Today the outflow of refugees from Ukraine reaches two million people. Two million,” Filippo Grandi, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, wrote on Twitter.

The update came as a new effort to evacuate civilians along safe corridors finally got under way Tuesday. The route out of the eastern city of Sumy was one of five promised by the Russians to offer civilians a way to escape the Russian onslaught.

Michelle Bachelet, the U.N. High Commissioner for human rights, is pressing for all civilians trapped by fighting in Ukraine to be allowed to leave safely. She said Tuesday she is “deeply concerned about civilians trapped in active hostilities in numerous areas.”

Bachelet also told the U.N. Human Rights Council that her office has received reports of pro-Ukrainian activists being arbitrarily detained in areas of eastern Ukraine that have recently come “under the control of armed groups.” She said there have been reports of beatings of people considered pro-Russian in government-controlled areas.

EU to sanction more Russian oligarchs, Belarus banks over Ukraine invasion: report

The European Commission has prepared a new package of sanctions against Russia and Belarus over the invasion of Ukraine that will hit additional Russian oligarchs and politicians and three Belarusian banks, three sources told Reuters on Tuesday.

The sanctions, to be discussed by EU ambassadors on Tuesday at a meeting starting at 1400 GMT, will ban three Belarusian banks from the SWIFT banking system and add several oligarchs and Russian lawmakers to the EU blacklist, which already includes many, the sources told Reuters.

The new sanctions package also bans exports from the EU of maritime technology to Russia, and provides guidance on the monitoring of cryptocurrencies to avoid their use to circumvent EU sanctions, the sources said.

Ukraine’s Zelensky to address British Parliament

LONDON - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will address British lawmakers via videolink in the House of Commons on Tuesday, the first time a president of another country has addressed the main Westminster chamber.

Zelensky, who has spoken to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on several occasions since Russia invaded his country, has made a number of impassioned speeches to Western leaders in the last week, asking for supplies and military support.

He will address the chamber at 1700 GMT when formal parliamentary business will be suspended. Lawmakers will be able to watch the speech on screens installed overnight, with 500 headsets providing a simultaneous translation in English.

Former world leaders including U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, and Germany’s Angela Merkel, have previously made speeches in other parts of the parliamentary estate on the banks of the River Thames, including in the ornate Royal Gallery or vast Westminster Hall.

“Every parliamentarian wants to hear directly from the president, who will be speaking to us live from Ukraine, so this is an important opportunity for the House,” Speaker Lindsay Hoyle said in a statement.

Ben Wallace, Britain’s defence minister, told Sky News he expected the address to be “incredibly powerful.”

Ukraine’s ambassador to London was given a very rare standing ovation when he appeared in the chamber to observe Johnson answering lawmakers’ questions last week.

‘Humanitarian corridor’ set to allow civilians out of Ukraine’s Sumy: deputy PM

Civilians will start leaving the besieged Ukrainian city of Sumy on Tuesday under an agreement with Russia on the establishment of a “humanitarian corridor,” Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said.

“It has been agreed that the first convoy will start at 10 a.m. from the city of Sumy. The convoy will be followed by the local population in personal vehicles,” she said in a televised statement.

Civilians have been trapped by fighting since Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. Moscow calls its actions in Ukraine a “special military operation.”

Russia proposed giving the residents of Sumy, in northeastern Ukraine, and Mariupol, a southern port city, the choice of moving elsewhere in Ukraine on Tuesday, Russian news agencies reported.

Other humanitarian corridors proposed by Russia would travel through Russia or Belarus, something Ukrainian authorities have previously rejected.

Russia dangles prospect of safe corridors; Ukraine skeptical

Safe corridors intended to let Ukrainian civilians escape the Russian onslaught could open Tuesday, Kremlin officials said, though Ukrainian leaders greeted the plan with skepticism since prior efforts to establish evacuation routes crumbled amid renewed attacks.

With the invasion well into its second week, Russian troops were making significant advances in southern Ukraine but stalled in some other regions. Soldiers and volunteers fortified the capital, Kyiv, with hundreds of checkpoints and barricades designed to thwart a takeover. A steady rain of shells and rockets fell on other population centres, including the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, where the mayor reported heavy artillery fire.

“We can’t even gather up the bodies because the shelling from heavy weapons doesn’t stop day or night,” Mayor Anatol Fedoruk said. “Dogs are pulling apart the bodies on the city streets. It’s a nightmare.”

Lviv struggling to feed people fleeing war

The mayor of Lviv said the city in far western Ukraine is struggling to feed and house the tens of thousands of people who have fled here from war-torn regions of the country.

“We really need support,” Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said.

More than 200,000 Ukrainians displaced from their homes are now in Lviv, filling up sport halls, schools, hospitals and church buildings. The historical city once popular with tourists had a population of 700,000 before the war.

The mayor said the city needs big tents equipped with kitchens so food can be prepared.

Hundreds of thousands more people could arrive if humanitarian corridors are opened up from cities now under siege from Russian troops.

The embassies of the U.S. and EU countries also moved to Lviv from Kyiv before the invasion.

Lviv is the main transit point for those fleeing just across the border to Poland. Many of the 1.7 million Ukrainians now abroad passed through the city. The United Nations has called the situation the fastest growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.

Ukraine says Russian general killed

A Russian general was killed in the fighting around Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, which Russian forces have been trying to seize since the invasion began, the Ukrainian military intelligence agency said.

It identified him as Maj. Gen. Vitaly Gerasimov, 45, and said he had fought with Russian forces in Syria and Chechnya and had taken part in the seizure of Crimea in 2014.

It was not possible to confirm the death independently. Russia has not commented.

Another Russian general was killed earlier in the fighting. A local officers’ organization in Russia confirmed the death in Ukraine of Maj. Gen. Andrei Sukhovetsky, the commanding general of the Russian 7th Airborne Division.

Sukhovetsky also took part in Russia’s military campaign in Syria.

United States has banned Russian energy imports, tightening the economic chokehold on Moscow, whose invasion of Ukraine has forced over two million people to flee the country in 13 days.

US: Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline is 'dead'

The controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline that was halted over Russia's invasion of Ukraine is ""dead,"" a senior US official said, appearing to dash any hopes that the $12-billion gas venture could have a future.

""I think Nord Stream 2 is now dead,"" Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland told US lawmakers about the Kremlin's prize geopolitical energy project that became a victim of Western sanctions.

""It is a hunk of metal at the bottom of the sea, I don't think it will ever be revived,"" she added.

The comments, in a hearing assessing the US response to Russia's invasion, came on the same day President Joe Biden delivered a body blow to Moscow by announcing the United States was cutting off Russian energy imports.

The move marked a major tightening of the economic chokehold on President Vladimir Putin's Russia that has seen the country's currency crash, inflation and borrowing costs soar, and Moscow's access to global financial markets evaporate.

And ""there is more on the way from the G7 or EU partners and countries around the world if President Putin does not end this vicious war,"" Nuland said.

""We're also working with our allies and partners to limit the disruption of global energy supplies and to prevent Russia from weaponising its global energy exports, while also accelerating diversification of energy supplies.""

Russian warplanes hit residential areas in fresh strikes

Russian warplanes have carried new strikes on residential areas in the eastern and central parts of the country, Ukrainian authorities said.

Ukrainian officials said that two people, including a seven-year-old child, were killed in the town of Chuhuiv just east of Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine.

And in the city of Malyn in the Zhytomyr region west of the capital Kiev at least five people, including two children, were killed in a Russian air strike.

The Russian artillery has pounded the outskirts of Kiev, forcing civilians to hide in shelters while water, food and power supplies have been cut, said Yaroslav Moskalenko, an official who coordinates humanitarian efforts in the Kiev region.

He said that the shelling made it impossible to evacuate the bodies of five people who died when their vehicle was fired upon in Borodianka near Kiev and the bodies of 12 patients of a psychiatric hospital there.

He said that another 200 patients were stuck there without food and medicines.

First civilians evacuated from Ukraine's Sumy city arrive at destination



The first convoy carrying civilians from the city of Sumy in northern Ukraine has arrived via a humanitarian corridor in the central city of Poltava, Ukraine's presidency said.

""The first column of 22 buses has already arrived in Poltava,"" the president's deputy chief of staff Kyrylo Tymoshenko said on Telegram, hailing this as ""good news.""

He added that 1,100 foreign students would travel onwards by train to Lviv in Western Ukraine.

The second convoy of buses had already reached the Poltava region, the presidential administration said.

The humanitarian corridor was also used by drivers of civilian vehicles, he added.

Sumy, 350 kilometres east of Kiev, has experienced days of heavy fighting.

The Ukrainian authorities said that 21 people, including two children, were killed in air strikes in the besieged city on Monday.

""I am glad that the work of the evacuation team at this stage was completed successfully,"" Tymoshenko said.

Nearly 3,500 civilians were evacuated from Sumy under a temporary ceasefire that mostly held, said regional governor Dmytro Zhyvytsky in a televised interview.

Around 1,700 of the evacuees were foreign students studying at universities, Zhyvytsky said.

Evacuations also took place outside the capital Kiev.

But attempted evacuations from the port town of Mariupol have failed on several occasions in recent days, with both Kiev and Moscow blaming the other side for the failures.

Moscow has announced a humanitarian ceasefire in Ukraine for Wednesday morning to carry out the evacuation of the civilian population, Russian news agencies reported.

Russia announces humanitarian ceasefire for Wednesday

Moscow has announced a humanitarian ceasefire in Ukraine for Wednesday morning to carry out the evacuation of the civilian population, Russian news agencies have reported.

""From 10:00 MSK (0700 GMT) on March 9, 2022, the Russian Federation is declaring a 'regime of silence' and is ready to provide humanitarian corridors,"" a cell of the Russian defence ministry charged with humanitarian operations in Ukraine said.

It added that Russia proposes to agree the routes and start time of the humanitarian corridors with Ukraine ""before 03:00 MSK on March 9"".

Civilian evacuations took place on Tuesday morning, in particular from the town of Sumy, where two convoys left during the day, and Kiev.

Effort to relieve encircled Ukrainian port put in jeopardy

An attempt to evacuate civilians from the besieged port of Mariupol has been thrown into jeopardy by continued fighting as conditions grow more desperate inside the city of 430,000.

As Ukraine pleaded for more warplanes, Poland said it would give all of its MiG-29 fighter jets to the US, apparently agreeing to an arrangement that would allow them to be used by Ukraine’s military. Ukrainian pilots are trained to fly Soviet-era fighter jets.

Ukrainian officials said renewed Russian shelling and other risks endangered the effort to relieve an encircled Mariupol, where many were forced to get their water from streams or by melting snow. Hungry residents also broke into stores for food.

Evacuations from Mariupol have failed on several occasions in recent days with both Ukraine and Russia blaming each other.

BBC to resume English-language reporting from Russia

The BBC has announced it is resuming English-language broadcasting from Russia, after suspending reporting as it examined tough new media laws.

The broadcaster last Friday halted its journalists' work in Russia after lawmakers moved to impose lengthy jail terms for publishing ""fake news"" about the army, as part of efforts to muffle dissent over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

But in a new statement, the corporation said it had ""considered the new legislation alongside the urgent need to report from inside Russia"".

Do more to help, Ukraine's Zelenskyy tells Britain

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, invoking the wartime defiance of British prime minister Winston Churchill, has vowed to ""fight to the end"" in a virtual speech to UK lawmakers.

Addressing Britain's parliament and greeted by a standing ovation, Zelenskyy documented the Russian invasion day by day, listing the weapons used, the civilians killed and those running out of food and water.

""We will not give up and we will not lose. We will fight to the end at the sea, in the air, we will continue fighting for our land, whatever the cost. We will fight in the forests, in the fields, on the shores, in the streets.""

He said Britain and other Western countries had to go further, pressing on with more sanctions. He also asked them to recognise Russia as a ""terrorist state"".

""The question for us now is, to be or not to be,"" Zelenskyy said via video link. ""Now I can give you a definitive answer: it is yes, to be.""

CIA boss: China 'unsettled' by Russia's war in Ukraine

The CIA's director has said he believes China's leader Xi Jinping has been ""unsettled"" by Russia's difficulties in Ukraine, and by how the war has brought the United States and Europe closer.

""I think President Xi and the Chinese leadership are a little bit unsettled by what they're seeing in Ukraine,"" Central Intelligence Agency boss William Burns told US lawmakers.

""They did not anticipate the significant difficulties the Russians were going to run into,"" Burns said during a hearing on global threat assessments.

Ukraine says no longer insisting on NATO membership

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he is no longer pressing for NATO membership for Ukraine, a delicate issue that was one of Russia's stated reasons for invading its pro-Western neighbour.

In another apparent nod aimed at placating Moscow, Zelenskyy said he was open to ""compromise"" on the status of two breakaway pro-Russian territories that Moscow recognised as independent.

""I have cooled down regarding this question a long time ago after we understood that...NATO is not prepared to accept Ukraine,"" Zelenskyy said in an interview aired Monday night on ABC News.

""The alliance is afraid of controversial things, and confrontation with Russia,"" the president added.

Russia sees NATO enlargement as a threat, as it does the military posture of these new Western allies on its doorstep.

Biden bans Russia oil imports

US President Joe Biden has banned Russian oil and other energy imports in retaliation for the invasion of Ukraine.

He underscored strong bipartisan support for a move that he acknowledged would drive up US energy prices.

""That means Russian oil will no longer be acceptable in US ports and the American people will deal another powerful blow to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's war machine,"" Biden told reporters at the White House.

Biden voiced America's support for the Ukrainian people, and predicted their ultimate victory.

""Russia may continue to grind out its advance at a horrible price, but this much is already clear: Ukraine will never be a victory for Putin. Putin may be able to take a city, but he'll never be able to hold the country,"" he said.

UK to phase out Russian oil imports by end of 2022

Britain has said it will phase out Russian oil imports by the end of this year, in line with new sanctions announced by the United States following the invasion of Ukraine.

""This transition will give the market, businesses and supply chains more than enough time to replace Russian imports -– which make up 8.0 percent of UK demand,"" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng tweeted.

The oil sanction does not apply to Russian natural gas, which accounts for some four percent of UK supply. But Kwarteng said he was ""exploring options to end this altogether"".

Ukraine will service debt on time and in full

Ukraine says it will service its debt on time and in full, bolstered by financing from allies and international institutions who have rushed to Kiev's aid since the Russian invasion.

""We continue honouring our debt even in these extraordinary conditions,"" the finance ministry has told Reuters in a written comment.

Ukraine paid almost $698 million of its external obligations in the first two months of the year and faces a further $3.7 billion in March-December, including peaks of $499 million in May and $1.73 billion in September.

The ministry said Ukraine has access both to concessional and commercial financing.

Russia: Kiev declined to endorse evacuation routes

Moscow has said Ukrainian authorities endorsed only one civilian evacuation route from areas affected by fighting out of 10 that were proposed, including five towards territory controlled by Kiev, the Interfax news agency has reported.

The Russian defence ministry said 723 people had been evacuated through the Sumy-Poltava corridor, including 576 Indian nationals, in a first convoy.

Ukraine said on Monday that a Russian proposal on humanitarian corridors was ""completely immoral"" after Moscow suggested it would allow people to flee Ukrainian cities towards only Belarus or Russia.

EU plans two-thirds cut in Russian gas imports this year

The EU wants to vastly reduce Russian gas imports this year. The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, will announce the goal later on Tuesday.

The bloc's 27 member nations have stepped back from implementing a ban on Russian energy imports in the face of worries that the economic consequences would be too severe.

Instead, the commission said it could erase a huge share of its dependency on Russia supplies, ramping up reserves for next winter and accelerating efforts to be more energy efficient.

According to widely reported leaks of the plans, the EU executive would pledge to reduce gas dependency by two-thirds by the end of this year and make the EU fully independent of Russian gas, oil and coal by 2030.

""The enemy has launched an attack heading exactly at the humanitarian corridor,"" the defence ministry said on Facebook.

It added that the Russian army did not let children, women and elderly people leave the city. ""Such actions are nothing other than a genocide.""

NEW DELHI: India on Tuesday finally evacuated about 700 Indian students from Sumy in northeastern Ukraine The biggest challenge for India was to ensure their safe exit from Sumy which had been witnessing heavy shelling and intense exchange of fire between Russians and Ukrainian forces.However, India managed to create a humanitarian corridor after PM Modi's talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy Meanwhile, the United States on Tuesday rejected a Polish offer to send MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine via a US air base, saying the proposal raised ""serious concerns"" for the entire NATO alliance.Here are the other top developments in the story --Prime Minister Narendra Modi's phone talks with Russian and Ukrainian presidents, a series of separate intense diplomatic outreach in Delhi, Kyiv and Moscow and round-the-clock groundwork by three teams of Indian officials in Ukraine made the evacuation of students from the city of Sumy possible, people familiar with the operation said on Wednesday.These were the three main components of India's ""difficult and complex"" mission to evacuate around 600 of its students from the war-torn northeastern Ukrainian city, they said.The Indian students were pulled out of Sumy on Tuesday after Russia and Ukraine heeded a request by India to stop shelling and bombardments and create a humanitarian corridor to ensure their safe passage.The United Nations human rights office said on Wednesday that it had verified 1,424 civilian casualties since the Ukraine conflict began two weeks ago - 516 killed and 908 injured - but believed the real figures were ""considerably higher"".The civilian toll rose from 1,335 casualties that it reported on Tuesday - 474 civilians killed and 861 injured - since Russia's invasion began on February 24.Most civilian casualties were caused by explosive weapons including shelling and missile and air strikes, it said on Wednesday. Updated casualty figures from the towns of Volnovakha, Mariupol and Izium were still being corroborated amid allegations of hundreds of civilian casualties, it added.At least 1,170 civilians have been killed in Ukraine's besieged city of Mariupol since the start of the Russian invasion, a Ukrainian state information agency said on Wednesday, citing figures from Mariupol's deputy mayor.""At least 1,170 people have been killed and 47 were buried in a mass grave today,"" deputy mayor Serhiy Orlov was quoted as saying. ""People are without water, heat, electricity, gas, residents are melting snow to drink.""The United States has seen indications that Russia's military is bombing Ukraine using so-called ""dumb"" bombs that are not precision-guided and would have limited ability to hit targets precisely, a senior US defense official said on Wednesday.""We do have indications that the Russians are in fact dropping some dumb munitions,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity, adding that the United States was observing ""increasing damage to civilian infrastructure and civilian casualties.""The comments came shortly after Ukraine accused Russia on Wednesday of bombing a children's hospital in the besieged port of Mariupol. Russia denies targeting civilians.A children's hospital in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol has been destroyed by Russian air strikes, the city council said in an online post on Wednesday.""The Russian occupying forces have dropped several bombs on the children's hospital. The destruction is colossal,"" it said, adding that it did not yet know any casualty figures.Russia's defence ministry acknowledged that some conscripts were taking part in the conflict with Ukraine after multiple denials by President Vladimir Putin, who said only professional soldiers and officers had been sent in.The ministry said that some of them, serving in supply units, had been taken prisoner by the Ukrainian army.""Unfortunately, we have discovered several facts of the presence of conscripts in units taking part in the special military operation in Ukraine. Practically all such soldiers have been pulled out to Russia,"" it said, promising to prevent such situations in the future.Residents of the bombarded suburbs of Ukraine's capital snaked their way across the slippery wooden planks of a makeshift bridge that provided the only way to escape Russian shelling, amid renewed efforts Wednesday to rescue civilians from besieged cities.Thousands of people are thought to have been killed, both civilians and soldiers, in two weeks of fighting since President Vladimir Putin's forces invaded Ukraine. Th UN estimates that more than 2 million people have fled the country, the biggest exodus of refugees in Europe since the end of World War II.The Ministry of External Affairs had deployed more than 50 of its Russian speaking officials to execute Operation Ganga in Ukraine. A special team led by a joint secretary to take on-ground decisions vis-a-vis evacuation inside war-torn Ukraine also flew from New Delhi.Nearly 22,000 Indians, mainly students, have already been evacuated including from the most active dangerous zones like Kharkiv and Sumy in Ukraine.Dmytro Kuleba accused Russia on Wednesday of holding 400,000 residents of Mariupol hostage by shelling the southern Ukrainian port city despite efforts to establish a safe evacuation corridor for civilians.""Almost 3,000 newborn babies lack medicine and food,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""Russia continues holding hostage over 400,000 people in Mariupol, blocks humanitarian aid and evacuation. Indiscriminate shelling continues.""Russia has denied targeting civilians in what it calls a ""special operation"" in Ukraine.President Zelenskyy said efforts are under way to evacuate some 18,000 people from the capital Kyiv and embattled towns near it.He said Wednesday the efforts are part of broader evacuation attempts by multiple humanitarian corridors within Ukraine, and warned Russian forces against violating cease-fire promises.He appealed again for foreign air support, saying ""send us planes."" Western powers have sent military equipment and beefed up forces on Ukraine's eastern flank, but have been wary of providing air support and getting drawn into a direct war with Russia.He also issued an appeal, unusually in Russian, to urge Russian soldiers to leave.""Our resistance for almost two weeks has shown you that we will not surrender, because this is our home. It is our families and children. We will fight until we can win back our land,""he said. ""You can still save yourselves if you just go home.""The number of refugees fleeing Ukraine increased by more than 140,000 in 24 hours, according to United Nations figures issued Wednesday, with more than 2.15 million now having fled since Russia invaded on February 24.UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, recorded 2,155,271 refugees on its dedicated website -- 143,959 more than the previous count on Tuesday.""Behind the monolithic statistics are two million stories of separation, anguish, and loss,"" UNHCR chief Filippo Grandi said.Families have been ""senselessly ripped apart"", plunged into ""despair and unimaginable suffering"" by the ""brutal war"", he said.The Kremlin said on Wednesday that the United States had declared economic war on Russia and that Moscow would think seriously about what to do after US President Joe Biden imposed a ban on Russian oil and other energy imports.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia had been, is and would be a reliable energy supplier and pointed out that energy flows continued.""But you see the bacchanalia, the hostile bacchanalia, which the West has sown - and that of course makes the situation very difficult and forces us to think seriously,"" Peskov said.""The United States definitely has declared economic war against Russia and is waging this war,"" he said.Radioactive substances could be released from Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear power plant because it cannot cool spent nuclear fuel after its power connection was severed, Ukraine’s state-run nuclear company Energoatom said on Wednesday.Work to repair the connection and restore power to the plant, which has been occupied by Russian troops, has not been possible because fighting is under way, it said.On Wednesday, an air alert was sounded in and around the capital city of Kyiv, due to a potential missile threat.The authorities urged the residents to ensure their safety and move to bomb shelters as quickly as possible.Everyone immediately to shelters,'' regional administration head Oleksiy Kuleba said on Telegram.Meanwhile, 10 people were killed in a shooting in Severodonestk in eastern Ukraine, AFP quoted an official as saying.The Chernobyl nuclear power plant is no longer transmitting data to the UN's atomic watchdog, as it voiced concern for staff working under Russian guard at the Ukrainian facility.International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi ""indicated that remote data transmission from safeguards monitoring systems installed at the Chornobyl NPP had been lost"", AFP said in a statement.Ukrainian President has said that Ukraine is no longer pressing for Nato membership.In another apparent nod aimed at placating Moscow, Zelensky said he is open to ""compromise"" on the status of two breakaway pro-Russian territories that President Vladimir Putin recognized as independent just before unleashing the invasion on February 24.""I have cooled down regarding this question a long time ago after we understood that ...

Poland said Tuesday that it would give all of its MiG-29 fighter jets to the US, which Ukrainian pilots are trained to fly.

Total combat losses of the Russian troops from 24.02 to 08.03 were estimated at over 12,000 men, over 303 tanks, 1,510 armored vehicles and vehicles and 128 aircraft (planes and helicopters). The Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine successfully repelled enemy missile and air attacks and provided air cover for critical facilities in Ukraine and troop groups. The Kyiv defense forces continued to defend the capital along the outer defense line and in additionally defined directions.

Kyiv and Zhytomyr directions:

There was constant fighting in the Kyiv direction, particularly in Makariv, Irpin, Hostomel, and Borodianka. The Russian Armed Forces were accumulating troops and equipment, shelling social infrastructure.

Two Russian missiles were shot down over Boryspil, a third injured two people. In the evening, Russian troops launched a rocket attack on Korbutivka near Zhytomyr, hitting a dormitory in which civilians have lived for more than 20 years. The building was completely destroyed as a result of the missile attack.

The Izovat plant, producing 70 percent of Ukraine’s mineral wool, was destroyed in an airstrike in Zhytomyr.

In the city of Malyn, Zhytomyr region, an airstrike destroyed seven private single-story residential buildings.

Chernihiv and Sumy directions:

Russian planes dropped bombs on residential neighborhoods in Sumy this night. Six houses were destroyed and about 20 damaged, at least nine people were killed, including two children. In addition, Russian aviation raided Okhtyrka, bombing residential areas, the private sector and grocery stores. The already destroyed Okhtyrka thermal power plant was also hit again.

Kharkiv and Luhansk directions:

On March 8, in the Vovchansky district of the Kharkiv region, the aggressors landed an assault group of 120 people on 3 helicopters. The territorial defense together with the Armed Forces of Ukraine defeated the Russian troops. The vast majority of the Russian Armed Forces landing force was destroyed right on the spot. Those who survived escaped to the territory of the Belgorod region of Russia.

Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia directions:

The Armed Forces of Ukraine took a number of measures to evacuate civilians in Mariupol via a single route: roads were cleared of mines, engineering barriers were removed, etc. However, Russian troops did not let children, women, and elderly people out of the city and launched an attack in the direction of the humanitarian corridor.

Defending Mariupol, the Azov Detachment conducted an effective counterattack operation and defeated units of the 102nd Motorized Rifle Regiment of the 150th Motorized Rifle Division of the Southern Military District with its location in Novocherkassk (Rostov region). The Ukrainian military obtained documentation of the Russian Armed Forces, including name lists of Russian servicemen attempting to break into Mariupol.

Around 16:30, an air raid on Mariupol was carried out. Two bombs were dropped on institutions of the International Red Cross and the Ukrainian Red Cross Society. Residential buildings and a shopping center were destroyed.

Mykolaiv and Kherson directions:

Ukrainian Armed Forces reinforcements with equipment arrived in Mykolaiv, defenders were preparing for the aggressor’s offensive.

Resistance

Residents of Kherson region continued to hold protests calling against the temporary occupation by Russian troops. Within a day, rallies were held in Oleshki, Hola Prystan, Berezhanka and the Verkhny Rogachyk township.

In Zaporizhzhia region, residents of Melitopol, Tokmak and Berdyansk also continued their pro-Ukrainian peaceful actions.

In Kharkiv region, about three dozen residents of Kupyansk staged an anti-Russian rally, which lasted half an hour and did not provoke a reaction from Russian troops.

Information confrontation

In the temporarily occupied territories of Kherson and Mykolaiv Regions, the enemy uses psychological warfare units. 10 tactical groups were created to conduct propaganda work with local residents.

Russian information and psychological operations units actively began spreading a disinformation campaign among the residents of Kyiv in social networks about the lack of reagents for water purification and problems with its quality. The official authorities urged people not to believe rumors and fakes, and to check the information only on the official information channels of the authorities and public utilities.

In Balakliya, Russian troops are collecting dozens of buses with the crowd to shoot staged stories for the Russian media. They plan to shoot stories about the liberation of the town from the “nationalists” and gratitude to the Russian troops. The purpose of these stories is to justify military action in Ukraine, distort the existing reality, and increase support for the Russian leadership.

In Mariupol, Russian troops began broadcasting Russian propaganda over radio frequencies. They were actively spreading narratives that the top political and military commanders had fled the territory of Ukraine and that the so-called “DNR” occupied the entire Donetsk region.

In Berdyansk, the Russian military seized the “Azov Wave” radio station. The radio station seized by the Russian Armed Forces’ troops may start broadcasting propaganda and anti-Ukrainian information in the near future.

Mayors and heads of state administrations of various localities, in particular, mayors and heads of city/regional administrations of Kharkiv, Sumy, Odesa, Chernihiv, Irpin, Bila Tserkva, and others simultaneously began receiving SMS messages with threats and demands to surrender the populated area, let Russian troops in, and support the Russian Armed Forces.

The Russian Federation began spreading another fake that the UN prohibited its employees from using the flag of Ukraine in social networks and calling the war on the territory of Ukraine a war. Instead, it was recommended to treat these events as a conflict or a military offensive. After the news was widely publicized in the media, the UN denied this information and stated that no such instructions were given to the employees.

Parents’ school Viber chats in the temporarily occupied Crimea tried to intimidate the Crimeans not to protest against Russia’s full-scale war against Ukraine, as well as the economic situation resulting from the sanctions directed against Russia. The implicit language constructions traced the threats of imprisonment of children in order to have more influence on the parents.

HUMANITARIAN SITUATION



Vorzel, Bucha, Hostomel, Zabuchchya, Irpin are cities in the Kyiv direction, where there is no mobile communication, light, water supply. Due to fires in many neighborhoods had to cut off gas supply. People are forced to sit in cold basements, sometimes without food and water. This is the epicenter of a humanitarian catastrophe. The district receives humanitarian medical and food aid. But the aggressor does not give the opportunity to help the occupied communities.

The situation in Mariupol remains critical, with Russia effectively taking 300,000 civilians hostage and refusing to evacuate them, despite agreements with the International Committee of the Red Cross. Residents of Mariupol and other cities in Ukraine need food, water and medical care. One child died of dehydration.

The aggressors offered unprotected people to be evacuated to Russia via Belarus, as we pointed out earlier, this is a war crime.

The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, once again violating the rules of warfare, fired on the civilian infrastructure of Okhtyrka. As a result of the bombings and shellings, as of 1 pm on March 8, one civilian was killed and 14 others were injured.

Kharkiv has been under fire since the beginning of the war, the city has suffered significant damage, as of 18:00 on March 8, since February 24 in Kharkov and the region killed 170 civilians, including 5 children. Russian aggressors shot dead two volunteers who came to Feldman Ecopark to feed the animals.

In Mykolaiv the minibus which was marked by signs of a “red cross” came under fire of the Russian military. As a result of the shelling, according to preliminary information, at least three educators of a family-type orphanage who were going to change colleagues were killed.

The city of Izyum in the Kharkiv region was destroyed by fighting, bridges were blown up, evacuation was not possible, and locals needed urgent humanitarian assistance. Russian troops completely destroyed the city’s central hospital.

The UN High Commissioner for Refugees estimates the number of people who left Ukraine because of the war at 2 million.

INTERNATIONAL REACTION



Important achievements of Ukrainian diplomacy are changes in the international energy arena. The United States is imposing a ban on imports of Russian oil and gas to the United States due to the war in Ukraine. The British government intends to stop importing Russian oil by the end of 2022. The European Commission has proposed a plan REPowerEU, which provides for a reduction in EU demand for Russian gas by two thirds by the end of 2022.

The Council of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has decided to immediately suspend the participation of Russia and Belarus in all its bodies.

After Volodymyr Zelensky’s remote speech in the British Parliament on March 8, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised to do everything possible to make Russian leader Vladimir Putin lose the war against Ukraine. Johnson noted that Britain will influence the situation by helping Ukraine with weapons and economically holding back Russia.

US President Joe Biden noted the strong opposition of Ukrainians to the Russian occupation forces and expressed the opinion that already at this stage of the war it is clear that Ukraine will not be a “victory” for Putin. Biden added that the United States would continue to support Ukrainians in their struggle and called on Congress to support a $12 billion aid package for Ukraine.

The World Bank has announced its intention to provide Ukraine with more than $700 million to help the Ukrainian government continue to provide vital services to people: salaries for doctors, pensions and social benefits for vulnerable groups.

Luxembourg has provided €250 million in aid to Ukraine, while €106 million has been raised in the Netherlands for housing, health care and water supplies for war victims.

And although Russia has already become the most sanctioned state in the world due to the invasion of Ukraine, the international community continues to impose sanctions on Russia.

Thus, the European Commission has prepared a new package of sanctions against Russia and Belarus, which provides:

– a ban on the export of marine technology from the EU to Russia;

– closing access to the SWIFT system to three Belarusian banks;

– inclusion of several oligarchs and Russian deputies in the “black list”.

At the same time, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators has introduced a bill proposing to ban Russia’s operations with gold reserves, which could mitigate the effects of sanctions. It is reported that if sanctions are imposed on these reserves, it could potentially further isolate Russia from the world economy and further complicate Putin’s military campaign.

International companies and organizations continue to stop cooperating with Russia due to aggression on the territory of Ukraine.

Russia has been slammed for peddling 'fake news' after claiming a pregnant survivor of the Mariupol hospital bombing was a beauty blogger in makeup as the Kremlin desperately attempts to deny attacking mothers and their babies.

Nadine Dorries, the UK culture secretary, denounced a tweet by Russia's London embassy which identified a bloodied patient seen evacuating from Mariupol maternity hospital on Wednesday evening as 'Marianna' - a beauty blogger from the city.

The tweet - which has since been deleted for violating Twitter's 'community guidelines' - claimed the blogger 'played' the roles of two victims in photos it said were taken by a 'propagandist', who is actually a photographer for respected news wire Associated Press.

It comes after Sergey Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, told a news conference earlier in the day that the hospital was a 'legitimate target' because there were no patients in it at the time of the attack and it had been overtaken by 'extremists' from the Azov Brigade which is defending the city.

Images and video from the scene clearly show several pregnant women taken out of the badly damaged hospital with injuries. Ukraine said three people died in the attack, including a six-year-old girl, while 17 others including hospital staff were wounded.

At the same press conference, Lavrov claimed that Russia 'never attacked Ukraine' and denounced international outcry over the hospital attack as 'pathetic'. President Volodymyr Zelensky has described the bombing as a 'war crime', while Prime Minister Boris Johnson called it 'depraved'.

Lavrov spoke out amid a slew of disinformation from the Kremlin over the last 48 hours aimed at justifying Putin's decision to invade Ukraine whilst also seeking to minimise or obfuscate Russia's role as instigator of the conflict.

Russian POW says he was told to shoot CIVILIANS and was part of a unit sent to capture Kharkiv in three days before being captured by Ukrainian forces A captured Russian commander has revealed he was told to shoot civilians and was part of a unit sent to capture Kharkiv in three days. The man, a platoon leader in Russia's military according to Ukrainian authorities, said Vladimir Putin had ordered the troops to occupy the city of Kharkiv before advancing and capturing other Ukrainian cities. The soldier, who has not been named, said they were told to 'open fire' on the civilian population in Kharkiv, after they landed in Ukraine at the beginning of Russia's invasion on 24 February. 'There was a command to capture the city of Kharkiv, occupy all the roads, block civilian exits and occupy the city,' the soldier, who was captured by Ukrainian forces after a shootout, said in a video released by Ukraine's Security Service. A captured Russian commander has revealed he was told to shoot civilians and was part of a unit sent to capture Kharkiv in three days When asked what other tasks the Russian troops were given when they moved in on Ukraine, he said: 'We had permission to open fire on command and on all city residents,' adding that there was an order to shoot civilians. The soldier, who said his platoon arrived in Ukraine on February 24, added that it was their mission to capture Kharkiv within three days. But two weeks after Russia began its barbaric invasion, Kharkiv is still under Ukrainian control. But the city is still being heavily pummelled by surrounding Russian forces, with local forces reporting artillery fire. Advertisement

Foreign ministry spokesman Maria Zakharova on Wednesday claimed that Ukraine was developing bioweapons in laboratories near the border with American help which 'forced' Putin to launch his attack, claims which have been dismissed by Washington as false.

Claims of WMDs in Ukraine are being pushed by Russia after its initial justification for the war - genocide against civilians in Donbass - was quickly abandoned after the Pentagon warned ahead of time that 'false flag' operations in the region would be used to create a pre-text for conflict.

Sergei Orlov, deputy mayor of Mariupol, said he is 'absolutely sure' the Russians knew they were bombing a hospital when they launched the attack late yesterday - adding 'this is the third hospital they have destroyed' after a 300-bed Covid unit and blood bank were targeted on Tuesday.

Orlov accused Putin's men of trying to create a humanitarian crisis in Mariupol in the hopes of weakening Ukrainian defences and making it easier for Russian troops - which have surrounded the city for more than a week - to seize, having largely failed to take control of cities elsewhere.

It is hardly the first time that Russian commanders have been accused of deliberately striking hospitals.

During the bombing of Aleppo, in Syria, humanitarian groups said Putin's warplanes had systematically blown up medical facilities in the city before Bashar al-Assad's troops rolled in to seize it.

Observers have suggested that Russia is now using a Syria-style battleplan against Ukraine after its early precision strikes failed.

The Ukrainian Healthcare Center, a think-tank based in the country, says that between the outbreak of fighting on February 24 and today, their team documented 42 cases of Russian forces attacking either healthcare facilities or medics in order to deliberately provoke a 'humanitarian crisis'.

Hospitals had been struck in every theatre where Russian forces were operating, the think-tank said, including Donetsk, Luhansk, Mariupol, Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Sumy, Zhytomyr, Zaporizhzhia and Mykolaiv.

'The humanitarian catastrophe is a part of Russia's hybrid war. [It] intends to spread panic, create a flow of refugees at the borders and force the Ukrainian government to surrender,' said Pavlo Kovtonyuk, co-founder of the think-tank.

The bombing took place during what was supposed to be a ceasefire in Mariupol so that civilians could evacuate. It marks the fourth time a so-called 'humanitarian corridor' out of the city has failed because Russian forces opened fire.

Ukraine now says that at least 71 children have been killed and more than 100 wounded in Ukraine since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a war on February 24, a Ukrainian parliament official said on Thursday.

The toll was announced amid outrage over the bombing Wednesday of a children's hospital in Mariopol that officials said killed three people, including a young girl.

The hospital was struck by several high explosive bombs which destroyed large parts of the buildings and courtyard, killing three people including a six-year-old girl and wounding 17 others

Ukraine has called the attack a 'war crime' while the city's deputy mayor has said he is 'certain' the Russians knew what they were targeting when they dropped the bombs

Ukrainian mothers say 'Russian b**tards' who ordered artillery strike on Mariupol maternity hospital as women were giving birth 'must be put to DEATH' Mothers across Ukraine have expressed their anger at the heartless bombing of the maternity hospital in Mariupol that has shocked the world. Women fought back tears as they told of their sympathy for the three who were killed and the dozens injured by the senseless bombardment by the Russian army. Mother Katia Poltorak spoke for many when branded the Kremlin leaders 'b**tards'. The 42-year-old, from Dnipro, who has a five-year-old son Miron, told MailOnline: 'The Russians are heartless b**tards. Anna Afinogenova (pictured) said she feared it could have been her who was giving birth as the bombs rained down 'These are not men, they are animals. My heart is broken. These killing are terrible. I cannot watch the news of the attack. It is too upsetting.' Anna Afinogenova told how she feared it could have been her who was giving birth as the bombs rained down. The 41-year-old from Kyiv, who has a one-year-old baby daughter Kira, said: 'I cannot think about what happened at the hospital without shedding tears. 'A year ago that could have been me, in hospital giving birth. My daughter had her first birthday only last week. 'To attack helpless and defenceless women and babies is unconscionable. The hospital is not a military target. Putin had no excuse to attack it. This was the worst kind of war crime.' Anastasia Pohorelova, added: 'Whoever ordered this operation must be put to death. It was worse than a war crime.' The 32-year-old had to flee from Dnipro with her sons Maxim, 6 and Yuroslav, 2. She said: 'We need to send a message to the world that this cannot be allowed to happen. It's such a terrible thing to have happened. These poor people were civilians.' Natalia Korniusha said: 'I am beyond angry. This is not war this is murder. To attack women and children like this is despicable. The people who ordered this atrocity need to be punished.'

'From the start of the Russian invasion and up to 11:00 am on March 10, 71 children have been killed and more than 100 wounded,' Lyudmyla Denisova, parliament's point person on human rights, wrote in a Telegram message.

The hospital was hit as Mariopol, a southeastern port in Ukraine, is under siege from Russian troops and pro-Russian separatists from the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.

Sources said 17 adults were also wounded in the bombing.

In Malyn, in the western Zhytomyr region, three children and two other people were killed when seven homes were destroyed in air strikes, according to Denisova, who cited several examples of children dying in air strikes.

On Wednesday night, two women and two children were killed when a shell hit their home in Slobozhanske, a village in the eastern Izium region, Denisova said, adding that a five-year-old girl survived.

In Irpin, not far from the capital Kyiv, a 10-year-old girl was gravely wounded and is fighting for her life in hospital.

This afternoon, President Zelensky told Russian leaders that their country's invasion of Ukraine will backfire, by landing them in court and making their people hate them.

'You will definitely be prosecuted for complicity in war crimes,' Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address.

The West has slapped harsh financial and economic sanctions on Russia because of the invasion, and the Ukrainian leader said the consequences will be felt by all Russians.

'And then, it will definitely happen, you will be hated by Russian citizens - everyone you have been deceiving constantly, daily, for many years in a row, when they feel the consequences of your lies in their wallets, in their shrinking possibilities, in the stolen future of Russian children.'

Millions of Ukrainians have been displaced by the fighting. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said Thursday that about 2 million people - half the population of the capital's metropolitan area - have left the city, which has become virtually a fortress. Another 2.3million have fled the country.

'Every street, every house . is being fortified,' Klitschko said. 'Even people who in their lives never intended to change their clothes, now they are in uniform with machine guns in their hands.'

Western officials said Russian forces have made little progress on the ground in recent days. But they have intensified the bombardment of Mariupol and other cities, trapping hundreds of thousands of people, with food and water running short.

Temporary cease-fires to allow evacuations and humanitarian aid have repeatedly faltered, with Ukraine accusing Russia of continuing its bombardments. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said 35,000 people managed to get out on Wednesday from several besieged towns, and more efforts were underway on Thursday in eastern and southern Ukraine - including Mariupol - as well as in the Kyiv suburbs.

The Mariupol city council posted a video showing buses driving down a highway. It said a convoy bringing food and medicine was on the way despite several days of thwarted efforts to reach the city.

'Everyone is working to get help to the people of Mariupol. And it will come,' said Mayor Vadym Boychenko.

Images from the city, where hundreds have died and workers hurried to bury bodies in a mass grave, have drawn condemnation from around the world.

Residents have resorted to breaking into stores for food and melting snow for water.

The city has been without heat for days as nighttime temperatures fall below freezing and daytime ones hover just above it.

Mariupol, which has been under heavy bombardment for more than a week, continued to suffering shelling on Thursday as a humanitarian support convoy made a fifth attempt to get into the city

Burning buildings are pictured on the outskirts of Mariupol, with the mayor saying 1,200 people have been killed in nine days of Russian shelling with bodies buried in mass graves

'The only thing (I want) is for this to be finished,' Volodymyr Bykovskyi said as he stood by a freshly dug trench where bodies were being buried. 'I don't know who's guilty, who's right, who started this. Damn them all, those people who started this!'

When the series of blasts hit the children's and maternity hospital in Mariupol, the ground shook more than a mile away. Explosions blew out windows and ripped away much of the front of one building.

Police and soldiers rushed to the scene to evacuate victims, carrying a bleeding woman with a swollen belly on a stretcher past burning and mangled cars. Another woman wailed as she clutched her child.

Regional Ukrainian police official Volodymir Nikulin, standing in the ruins, called the attack 'a war crime without any justification.' Britain's Armed Forces minister, James Heappey, said that whether the hospital was hit by indiscriminate fire or deliberately targeted, 'it is a war crime.'

U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, on a visit to Ukraine's neighbor Poland, backed calls for an international war-crimes investigation into the invasion, saying, 'The eyes of the world are on this war and what Russia has done in terms of this aggression and these atrocities.'

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov dismissed concerns about civilian casualties as 'pathetic shrieks' from Russia's enemies. He claimed without providing evidence that the Mariupol hospital had been seized by far-right radical fighters who were using it as a base - despite the fact that photographs from the aftermath showed pregnant women and children at the site.

Several rounds of talks have not stopped the fighting, and a meeting in a Turkish Mediterranean resort between Lavrov and his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, failed to find much common ground.

In their highest-level talks since the war began, the two sides discussed a 24-hour cease-fire but did not make progress, Kuleba said. He said Russia was still seeking 'surrender from Ukraine.'

'This is not what they are going to get,' he said, adding that he was willing to continue the dialogue.

Lavrov said Russia was ready for more negotiations but showed no sign of softening Moscow's demands.

Russia has alleged that Western-looking, U.S.-backed Ukraine poses a threat to its security. Western officials suspect Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to install a government friendly to Moscow in Kyiv as part of an effort to draw the former Soviet state back into its orbit.

Russia's military is struggling, facing heavier losses and stronger Ukrainian resistance than it apparently anticipated. But Putin's forces have used airpower to pummel key cities, often shelling populated areas.

In Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, 91-year-old Alevtina Shernina sat wrapped in a blanket, an electric heater at her feet, as cold air blew in through a damaged window. She survived the brutal World War II siege of Leningrad, now St. Petersburg, and is now under siege again, her health too fragile for her to be moved.

Her daughter-in-law Natalia said she was angry that Shernina 'began her life in Leningrad under the siege as a girl who was starving, who lived in cold and hunger, and she's ending her life' in similar circumstances.

'There were fascists there and there are fascists here who came and bombed our buildings and windows,' she said.

Boris Johnson says he fears Vladimir Putin WILL use chemical weapons in Ukraine because it would be 'straight out of Russia's playbook' as he warns Moscow is already preparing a 'fake story' to blame the West

By Jack Maidment and James Tapsfield for MailOnline

Boris Johnson today said he fears Vladimir Putin will use chemical weapons in Ukraine because it would be 'straight out of Russia's playbook'.

The Prime Minister said Mr Putin is in charge of a 'cynical, barbaric government' and he believes Moscow could resort to deploying chemical weapons after its invasion stalled in the face of fierce resistance from Ukrainian forces.

Mr Johnson also said he believes Russia is preparing a 'fake story' which it could use to deny using the weapons and to blame the West.

The Prime Minister told Sky News’ Beth Rigby Interviews show: ‘I will make you one other prediction by the way which is that the stuff that you are hearing about chemical weapons, this is straight out of their playbook.

‘They start saying that there are chemical weapons that have been stored by their opponents or by the Americans and so when they themselves deploy chemical weapons, as I fear they may, they have a sort of maskirovka, a fake story, ready to go. And you have seen it in Syria. You saw it even in the UK.’

Asked if it was his expectation that Russia will use chemical weapons, the premier said: 'I just note that that is what they are already doing [preparing a fake story]. It is a cynical, barbaric government I am afraid.’

Mr Johnson's comments came after Defence minister James Heappey insisted the bombing of a maternity hospital in Ukraine was a war crime as he called for Mr Putin and Russian generals to be held to account.

Mr Heappey stressed that the West is gathering evidence that can be used in a future prosecution, but said in a round of interviews: 'What you see on your TV screens is a war crime.'

It has been confirmed three people, including a child, died when warplanes bombed the hospital in besieged Mariupol as pregnant women gave birth in the basement.

President Volodymyr Zelensky has described the attack as an 'atrocity' and 'the ultimate proof of genocide against Ukrainians'.

The hospital, in the besieged city of Mariupol, was hit 'several times' by high-explosive Russian bombs - one of which missed the building by yards and left a crater two-stories deep, officials said. Other bombs scored 'direct hits', President Zelensky said, wounding at least 17 people.

Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine's deputy Prime Minister, said there can be 'no doubt' the hospital was deliberately 'targeted' by Russia in a chilling echo tactics used during the bombing of the Syrian city of Aleppo while Putin's men were fighting alongside dictator Basahr al-Assad's troops. Moscow denies targeting civilian facilities.

And Mr Heappey told Sky News this morning: 'What you see on your TV screens is a war crime.

'Clearly there is evidence to be gathered in which to prove it is a war crime, and Western countries are working together to make sure that evidence is gathered in the best way so people can be held to account.

'What Putin is doing is not a war waged between two militaries. Right now he has besieged a number of Ukrainian cities and he has waged a war against Ukrainian civilians.'

He added on BBC Breakfast: 'We ask ourselves the question how did this happen? Was it an indiscriminate use of artillery or missiles into a built-up area, or was a hospital explicitly targeted?

'Both are equally despicable, both, as the Ukrainians have pointed out, would amount to a war crime.

'So, what matters beyond the outrage of the fact that this has happened in the first place is to make sure all this is catalogued so when – and they surely will be – President Putin and everybody in the military chain of command beneath him – because war crimes are committed at every level not just the ultimate decisionmaker – people will be held to account for what they are doing in. It's utterly despicable.'

Pressed on whether he thinks the attack constitutes a war crime, he replied: 'Yes, if you deliberately target a piece of civilian infrastructure like a hospital, yes.

'If you use indiscriminate artillery into an urban area without due regard for the reality, you could hit a protected site like a hospital, then that too in my view is.'

Many of the pregnant women present at the hospital were hiding the the basement at the time of the strike on the orders of hospital authorities - a move indicative of the harsh bombardment suffered by Mariupol's citizens over the past week, and one which likely saved their lives.

Zelensky himself posted a video showing the badly damaged hospital buildings, filmed inside a destroyed ward room with its windows blown out and ceiling partially collapsed. More footage showed a car park covered in rubble and the smouldering wrecks of vehicles as injured families staggered into the freezing air while snow fell.

'Direct strike of Russian troops at the maternity hospital. People, children are under the wreckage. Atrocity! How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror? Close the sky right now! Stop the killings! You have power but you seem to be losing humanity,' the President tweeted.

He then took to Telegram, where he released a video statement from the presidential palace in Kyiv in which he said the hospital strike 'is the ultimate proof that what is happening is the genocide of Ukrainians'.

'Europeans, you can't say you didn't see what is happening. You have to tighten the sanctions until Russia can't continue their savage war,' he said.

'What kind of country bombs hospitals? Is afraid of hospitals? Of a maternity ward?

'Was someone insulting Russians? Were pregnant women shooting in direction of Rostov? Was it the ''denazification'' of a hospital? What the Russians did at Mariupol was beyond savagery.'

In a separate interview with Sky News, Zelensky added that Russian invaders want Ukrainians 'to feel like animals' by preventing them from accessing food or water, and implored NATO and the West to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine.

'They want us to feel like animals because they blocked our cities... because they don't want our people to get some food or water.

'Don't wait for me to ask you several times, a million times, to close the sky. You have to phone us, to our people who lost their children, and say ''sorry we didn't do it yesterday.''

Mr Johnson has condemned the strike as 'depraved' and vowed to step up support to the beleaguered Ukrainian military.

'There are few things more depraved than targeting the vulnerable and defenceless,' the Prime Minister declared.

'The UK is exploring more support for Ukraine to defend against airstrikes and we will hold Putin to account for his terrible crimes,' he added.

Mr Johnson later on Wednesday committed to enacting the 'maximum economic cost' on Russia in wake of the bombing, while Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is expected to say aggression like Vladimir Putin's must 'never again' be allowed to 'grow unchecked' in her speech tomorrow in Washington.

Ms Truss will make comparisons between the Russian president's actions and the World Trade Centre terror attack in 2001, and will urge the international community to change its approach to dealing with antagonistic world leaders.

The White House press secretary Jen Psaki also commented: 'As a mother - I know a number of you are mothers - it is horrifying to see the barbaric use of military force to go after innocent civilians in a sovereign country.'

Mariupol's city council said the hospital had suffered 'colossal' damage but did not immediately give a figure of the wounded and dead.

The deputy head of Mr Zelensky's office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, said authorities are trying to establish the number of victims.

Ukrainian MP Dmitry Gurin told the BBC: 'There are a lot of dead and wounded women. We don't know about children or newborns yet.'

Video footage from the aftermath of the attack showed that large parts of the hospital had completely collapsed, while blood soaked mattresses were pictured lying in hallways.

'Russia committed a huge crime,' said Volodymir Nikulin, a top regional police official, standing in the ruins. 'It is a war crime without any justification.'

Mariupol has been under heavy Russian bombardment for more than a week, with food, water and electricity cut off several days ago - with the Red Cross describing conditions there as 'apocalyptic'.

The head of the Ukrainian Red Cross said yesterday's strike will likely cause a complete collapse of paediatric care in Mariupol, as much of the hospital's equipment and the paediatric care wards were reduced to ashes.

Ukraine has rejected most Russian evacuation routes because they lead to Russian soil or that of its ally, Belarus, while routes that Ukraine has proposed have come under bombardment. The only successful evacuation to take place so far has been from Sumy to Poltava (in green)

Local official Pavlo Kyrylenko confirmed the fears in a post on Facebook: The maternity ward in the city centre, the children's ward and the therapy ward at the hospital - all destroyed in the Russian air raid.'

Just hours before the hospital was hit, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba warned that 3,000 babies were without food or medicines and begged for a humanitarian corridor to allow them to flee.

Moscow had promised a ceasefire in the city today so civilians could be evacuated, but failed for the fourth time to keep its word - a move Kyrylenko said 'crossed the line of humanity' before declaring Russians should 'stop calling yourselves human beings.'

Residents of Mariupol were pictured on Wednesday dumping bodies into mass graves dug on the outskirts of the city in a desperate attempt to remove the dead amid the sustained Russian bombardment.

It is not the first time that Russian airstrikes have targeted hospitals. While fighting alongside Bashar al-Assad in Syria in 2016, Putin's generals were accused of 'deliberately and systematically' blowing up hospitals as a way of weakening the city of Aleppo ahead of a ground assault.

Observers have suggested that Russia is now using a Syria-style battleplan against Ukraine after its early precision strikes failed.

The Ukrainian Healthcare Center, a think-tank based in the country, says that between the outbreak of fighting on February 24 and yesterday, their team documented 42 cases of Russian forces attacking either healthcare facilities or medics in order to deliberately provoke a 'humanitarian crisis'.

Hospitals had been struck in every theatre where Russian forces were operating, the think-tank said, including Donetsk, Luhansk, Mariupol, Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Sumy, Zhytomyr, Zaporizhzhia and Mykolaiv.

'The humanitarian catastrophe is a part of Russia's hybrid war. [It] intends to spread panic, create a flow of refugees at the borders and force the Ukrainian government to surrender,' said Pavlo Kovtonyuk, co-founder of the think-tank.

The bombing took place during what was supposed to be a ceasefire in Mariupol so that civilians could evacuate. It marks the fourth time a so-called 'humanitarian corridor' out of the city has failed because Russian forces opened fire.

The mayor of Izyum, to the east of Kharkiv, said evacuations that were supposed to be underway there yesterday also had to stop because Russians were bombing the escape route. But in Sumy, a short distance away, some civilians had managed to make it out. Successful evacuations also took place in Enerhodar, in the south, with women and children able to leave.

It is feared the evacuations are simply a precursor to Russia stepping up its bombardment of the cities to wear down dogged Ukrainian defenders before rolling in troops and tanks to capture them. CIA Director William Burns, briefing Congress on Putin's state of mind Tuesday, warned the 'angry and frustrated' despot is 'likely to double down and try to grind down the Ukrainian military with no regard for civilian casualties.'

Giving an update on the military situation yesterday afternoon, Ukrainian commanders said Russian units continue to try and surround the capital Kyiv with attacks taking place to the west and north-east of the city, with several highways blocked.

New footage released on Wednesday purported to show Russian armour just 13 miles from Kyiv as the invaders pushed through the town of Irpin.

Fighting also raged close to the city of Sumy in an attempt to surround Ukraine's second-largest city of Kharkiv, commanders said. Battles also broke out around the city of Mykolaiv in the south, as Russians attempted to push out from Kherson towards Odessa but were turned back.

Ukrainian commanders also said Russian military police had rounded up 400 activists protesting against the invasion in the occupied city of Kherson - as the long arm of Vladimir Putin's police state reached across the border to grab people on foreign soil.

Russia's defence ministry meanwhile acknowledged for the first time on Wednesday that some conscripts had been sent to fight on the frontlines in Ukraine, just days after Putin promised that only professional soldiers would be sent in.

Some associations of soldiers' mothers in Russia had raised concerns about a number of conscripts going incommunicado at the start of what Kremlin calls a 'special military operation' in Ukraine, suggesting they could have been sent to fight despite a lack of adequate training.

The revelation comes just one week after Russia's parliament passed a law imposing a prison term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally 'fake' news about the military.

'Unfortunately, we have discovered several facts of the presence of conscripts in units taking part in the special military operation in Ukraine. Practically all such soldiers have been pulled out to Russia,' the defence ministry said, promising to prevent such situations in the future.

Liz Truss described the hospital attack as 'absolutely abhorrent', but continued to reject Ukraine's request for a no-fly zone to be imposed over its skies.

Speaking in Washington, she said: 'The best way we can protect the skies is through anti-air weaponry which the UK is now going to be supplying to Ukraine.

'Of course the attack on the hospital is absolutely abhorrent, reckless and appalling.'

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said US involvement in a no-fly zone could 'prolong' the conflict, making it 'even deadlier'.

'Our goal is to end the war, not to expand it, including potentially expanding it to Nato territory,' he said.

'We want to make sure it is not prolonged, to the best of our ability. Otherwise, it is going to turn even deadlier, involve more people and I think potentially even make things harder to resolve in Ukraine itself.'

Earlier, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told the MPs that the Ministry of Defence was looking at whether they could supply anti-aircraft missiles as well as more anti-tank weapons.

Putin meets his 'children's rights commissioner' in Moscow as rockets destroy hospital Vladimir Putin has met with his 'children's rights commissioner' in Moscow at the same time as shelling a maternity hospital in Mariupol in his latest vile display of hypocrisy. The Russian leader spoke with Maria Lvova-Belova at the Kremlin today after overseeing a savage two-week campaign in Ukraine which has seen children killed, orphaned or forced to flee their homes. Putin held the meeting to discuss changes to the law which will allow Russians to adopt Ukrainian orphans, after his forces killed their parents. The changes will mean children from Donetsk and Luhansk who do not have Russian citizenship will qualify for adoption. Putin said in the meeting: 'These are extraordinary circumstances and it seems to me that we need to think not about bureaucratic delays, but about the interests of children. 'I will make proposals, we will change the legislation. We will appeal to the State Duma, I am sure that the deputies will support you.' Lvova-Belova said 1,090 orphans have been evacuated to Russia from the two republics. An estimated one million children have been forced to flee Ukraine since the barbaric invasion was launched.

'We can all see the horrific devastation inflicted on civilian areas by Russian artillery and air strikes, indiscriminate and murderous,' he said.

'It is vital, therefore, that Ukraine maintains its ability to fly and to suppress Russian air attack.'

Mr Wallace said that 'in response to a Ukrainian request' the Government was exploring the donation of Starstreak high-velocity man-portable anti-air missiles.

He also confirmed that 3,615 Nlaw anti-tank weapons had been supplied - up from the previously-announced figure of 2,000 - and 'small consignments' of the Javelin system would also be sent to Ukraine.

Other Western officials expressed concern that Putin could next resort to the use of 'non-conventional weapons' such as chemical weapons, in the conflict.

One official speaking on condition of anonymity said: 'I think we've got good reason to be concerned about possible use of non-conventional weapons, partly because of what we've seen has happened in other theatres.

'As I've mentioned before, for example, what we've seen in Syria, partly because we've seen a bit of setting the scene for that in the false flag claims that are coming out, and other indications as well.'

Before the rocket attack took place, Mariupol's deputy mayor spoke about the dire situation in the besieged city - saying residents had been forced to use melted snow as drinking water, as it runs dangerously low on supplies.

Serhiy Orlov admitted that he didn't know how long the blockaded urban centre would be able to continue under siege as he spoke to CNN's John Berman about the devastating bombings on Wednesday.

Orlov said today was their fifth attempt to provide a humanitarian corridor to get supplies and transport into Mariupol, but he added that by 3pm local time, the buses had not made it anywhere near the city.

He said many residents are unable to leave as Mariupol is being bombed 'each second', after Russian forces have broken their ceasefire agreement despite agreeing to open 'humanitarian corridors' allowing citizens to flee.

'There is no ceasefire, any ceasefire in Mariupol, Mariupol is under continuous shelling from the artillery and bombing. Each hour, each minute, each second,' he added.

Mariupol, which has been under blockage for eight days, is one of the Ukrainian cities worst hit since the invasion began, with Russian forces bringing widespread destruction to residential and administrative centres.

Speaking about the devastation across the city, Orlov said Russian forces had destroyed their biggest steel planter as he warned that the situation is 'unmanageable'.

He praised the bravery of the Ukrainian army, but warned that it is the humanitarian crisis is also worsening, adding: 'We are not able to protect our lives.'

President Volodymyr Zelensky yesterday warned that the port city was running dangerously low on food, water and medicine.

Ukrainian territorial defence forces have been able to deliver vital supplies to some residents, but many more remain isolated and unable to access lifesaving rations.

Reiterating Zelensky's stark warning, Orlov said there is no more electricity, heating, gas or water supplies in Mariupol, adding that residents have had to resort to collecting wood to make fires for warmth and using melted snow as drinking water.

'It's an awful situation and I cannot imagine in my mind that it's possible in the 21st century, but it is true,' he said.

When asked how long the city might be able to continue under siege, Orlov admitted he 'didn't know' as he claimed there are at least 3,000 infants who are currently without food.

American talk show host Berman also asked the deputy mayor whether his own family are safe, after he previously spoken about being unable to reach his parents.

In response, a devastated Orlov said the district where his parents lived has been completely destroyed, saying it 'does not exist anymore', as he admitted he doesn't know if they are alive.

He added: 'The district where they live is flattened and I'm not sure that I can see them anymore. But I hope and pray they are alive.'

Ukrainian commanders said today that Russia's attack on the country has 'slowed significantly' with no major gains in any sector while its forces were bolstering defenses in key cities and 'holding the line.'

In the northern city of Chernihiv, Russian forces are placing military equipment among residential buildings and on farms, the Ukrainian general staff said. And in the south, it said Russians dressed in civilian clothes are advancing on the city of Mykolaiv. It did not provide any details of new fighting.

In Kyiv, back-to-back air alerts Wednesday morning urged residents to get to bomb shelters as quickly as possible over fears of incoming Russian missiles. Soon after an all-clear was given for the first alert, a second alert followed.

Such alerts are common, though irregular, keeping people on edge. Kyiv has been relatively quiet in recent days, though Russian artillery has pounded the outskirts.

Kyiv regional administration head Oleksiy Kuleba said the crisis for civilians was growing in the capital, with the situation particularly critical in the city's suburbs.

'Russia is artificially creating a humanitarian crisis in the Kyiv region, frustrating the evacuation of people and continuing shelling and bombing small communities,' he said.

Meanwhile, Boris Johnson continued to resist calls to drop visa requirements for Ukrainians fleeing the violence, insisting the security checks were vital to prevent President Putin infiltrating agents into the UK.

The Prime Minister said a thousand visas had been granted under the scheme allowing relatives of people in Britain to flee the war zone to join their families and he promised another programme allowing individuals to offer a home to Ukrainians would be set out in 'the next few days'.

More than 2 million people have now fled Ukraine, according to the United Nations.

'We know how unscrupulous Putin can be in his methods, it would not be right to expose this country to unnecessary security risk and we will not do it,' he said.

'We are going to be as generous as we can possibly be, but we must have checks.'

His comments in the Commons followed a call from Ukraine's ambassador to the UK to temporarily drop the visa requirement.

Vadym Prystaiko hit out at the bureaucracy of the British system, telling MPs: 'I don't want to see these pictures of people banging at the doors in Calais and scratching the doors which are quite sealed.'
