On Friday, multiple videos filmed by citizens in the Obolon district in Kyiv surfaced showing the moment a military vehicle ran over and crushed a car driven by an elderly man.

In one video, a military vehicle can be seen barreling down an almost-empty road, swerving into the lane of a civilian driving in the opposite direction. The armored vehicle drives over the smaller car, completely crushing what appears to be a four-door sedan, then continues to drive as those who recorded the footage gasp in disbelief and terror.

In a second video, a group of civilians can be seen working together to free the man from the wreckage with what looks like a crowbar and an ax, while also using sheer manpower to help get the man out of the demolished car.

While alive as he is pulled from the twisted metal that was once his car, the man's current condition and identity are unknown.

The gut-wrenching video has been verified by Sky News and the Independent. PEOPLE has yet to independently verify the video.

The video is just one of the latest visuals depicting the absolute horror of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and is a grave reminder of the cost of war on civilians.

Russia began its invasion of Ukraine earlier this week after Vladimir Putin announced a ""special military operation"" in a televised address Thursday morning local time.

The attack is still-evolving but explosions and airstrikes have been reported, with threats mounting against the capital, Kyiv, a city of 2.8 million people.

Numerous residents have been seen trying to flee. ""We are facing a war and horror. What could be worse?"" one 64-year-old woman living in Kyiv told the Associated Press.

Ukrainian-born Dancing with the Stars pro, Maks Chmerkovskiy, has also been sharing regular updates about the ongoing conflict, saying that he was heading to a bomb shelter while trapped in Kyiv earlier today, adding that he ""just wants the shooting to stop.""

Video of the shocking moment posted online early Friday showed the tank swerving to drive over the car in Kyiv’s Obolon district before reversing back over it.

Several people are heard in the clip shrieking in horror while the tank sits atop the car before rolling backward. Sporadic gunfire is also heard in the background.

Another video showed an elderly man being rescued from the flattened car moments later. He appeared to be alert, but the extent of his injuries was not immediately clear. Several people went to the scene to free him from the obliterated vehicle in the aftermath of the apparently intentional attack.

The tank is believed to be a Strela-10 — an anti-aircraft vehicle used by both the Russian and Ukrainian armies, The Sun reported.

The driver was miraculously pulled from the destroyed vehicle alive.

The clash saw at least two people gunned down in a stolen Ukrainian army truck in a car park in front of a large apartment block in Obolon, found north of Kyiv.

As the sound of gunshots echoed off the nearby buildings, a tank - said to have been stolen by Russians - also crashed and crushed a civilian car on the road running past the car park.

Miraculously the driver - an elderly person - survived the shocking smash, and rescuers were later able to free the from the wreckage.

The two incidents were initially reported separately, but a new video clip posted to social media has revealed they were in fact linked, and part of the same skirmish.

Pictured: A tank comes under fire in the car park of an apartment building in a suburb near Kyiv. A man (pictured in the foreground) jumped out of the truck while under fire, but was shot and killed while trying to take cover on the floor

Aftermath: A Ukrainian military medic approaches the bodies of Russian servicemen wearing a Ukrainian army uniforms lying beside and inside a vehicle after they were shot during a skirmish in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv

Footage captured through one of the apartments overlooking the car park shows the military truck carrying an artillery gun rolling from the road, over a pathway and into the car park - all while being peppered with shots.

The windows of the truck have been shot out, and the large khaki-green truck comes to a slow stop in the middle of the car park.

There, one man wearing camouflage slumps from the rear of the truck and onto the ground below while being shot at, apparently injured.

After a few seconds of struggle, the man comes a stop and is shown lying motionless on the floor having being shot dead.

A Ukrainian soldier is shown advancing on the truck from the opposite side of the car park, while shots can still be heard ringing out.

As the soldier closes in, a large tank is then shown speeding down the road that runs past where the truck came to a stop.

The tank suddenly swerves to its left into the path of an on-coming civilian sedan that is being driven in the opposite direct, smashing into it at speed.

The incident, recorded from multiple angles, saw an armoured truck driving down a main road leading through a residential area. As the armoured vehicle came close to the civilian car, it suddenly swerved towards it - giving the driver little time to react

The huge armoured vehicle rolls over the top of the car, crushing it under its weight, and comes to a stop with some of the sedan still underneath.

Despite the huge crash behind him, the Ukrainian soldier is shown again inching closer to the truck. Meanwhile, the tank reverses back off the car - which had been shunted backwards onto tram tracks - and crushing it a second time.

It is unclear what caused the tank to swerve, but shots can still be heard in the lead up to the crash, suggesting it might have been targeted by gunfire.

Pictures of the scene after the skirmish and crash bring some order to the chaos.

In addition to the man who was shot dead on the ground next to the truck, the driver of the truck was also killed, presumably while driving the vehicle.

Photographs from the scene show him slumped over in the truck's cabin.

Miraculously, reports said that the driver of the car survived the shocking crash, with a further video (pictured) showing people working desperately to free them from the wreckage

It was later reported that the pair were Russian servicemen dressed in military fatigues in an apparent bid to sneak into Kyiv. This was not immediately verified.

Across the road, the pictures showed the destroyed sedan, which was almost completely flattened by the armoured truck.

The windscreen was flat and level with the bonnet, which was also crumpled. The engine was also exposed.

The pictures showed the person must have been able to lean down into their seat and across the passenger seat in order avoid being crushed.

Miraculously, reports said that the driver of the car survived the shocking crash, with a further video showing people working desperately to free them from the wreckage.

Using tools including, an axe and a crowbar, a group of men are shown in a video working to get the door loose so they can rescue the person, who was trapped in the car that is almost completely destroyed.

Viktor Berbash, 58, a local resident, told The Sun that he went to his balcony after he heard gunshots early on Friday.

'I saw an armoured vehicle and there was automatic fire. And here this car, with probably an anti-aircraft gun on it, was already here,' he told the newspaper.

'Two armoured vehicles were driving along the road, and the second of them deliberately drove into the oncoming lane,' he added.

'It was not by chance, it was for fun, there was no need for this. And it just ran into this car. Stopped, reversed over it again and drove on.'

Multiple video clips of the incident were shared on social media, with those posting it on Twitter reporting they were recorded in Obolon, found north of Kyiv.

One angle was taken from a window overlooking the street. While captured from a distance, the video shows the truck suddenly swerve into the car.

Another angle, taken from a window overlooking the multi-lane road, showed the aftermath of the crash, capturing the armoured vehicle reversing off the car.

Users on Twitter said that the armoured vehicle that crashed into the car appeared to be a 9K35 Strela-10 - a short-range surface-to-air missile system.

Missiles pounded Ukraine's capital on Friday as Russian forces pressed their advance and authorities in Kyiv said they were preparing for an assault aimed at overthrowing the government.

Air raid sirens wailed over Kyiv, a European city of three million people, and some residents sheltered in underground metro stations, a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched an invasion that has shocked the world.

Ukrainian officials said a Russian aircraft had been shot down and crashed into a building in Kyiv overnight, setting it ablaze and injuring eight people.

A senior Ukrainian official said Russian forces would enter areas just outside the capital later on Friday and that Ukrainian troops were defending positions on four fronts despite being outnumbered.

Kyiv city council warned residents of the Obolon district, near an air base seized on Thursday by Russian paratroopers, to stay indoors because of 'the approach of active hostilities'.

Windows were blasted out of a 10-storey apartment block near Kyiv's main airport, where a two-metre crater filled with rubble showed where a shell had struck before dawn. A policeman said people were injured there but not killed.

'How we can live through it in our time? What should we think. Putin should be burnt in hell along with his whole family,' said Oxana Gulenko, sweeping broken glass from her room.

A neighbour, Soviet army veteran Anatoliy Marchenko, 57, could not find his cat that had run away during the shelling.

'I know people there, they are my friends,' he said of Russia. 'What do they need from me? A war has come to my house.'

Witnesses said loud explosions could be heard in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-biggest city, close to Russia's border, and air raid sirens sounded over Lviv in the west. Authorities reported heavy fighting in the eastern city of Sumy.

Meanwhile, tens of thousands of people have fled the major cities.

Dozens have been reported killed. Russian troops seized the Chernobyl former nuclear power plant north of Kyiv as they advanced on the city from Belarus. Ukraine said radiation levels were elevated there.

U.S. officials believe Russia's initial aim is to topple President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and 'decapitate' his government. Zelenskiy said the troops were coming for him, but he would stay in Kyiv.

'(The) enemy has marked me down as the number one target,' Zelenskiy said in a video message. 'My family is the number two target. They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state.'

Russia launched its invasion by land, air and sea on Thursday following a declaration of war by Putin, in the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two.

Putin says Ukraine is an illegitimate state carved out of Russia, a view Ukrainians see as aimed at erasing their more than thousand-year history.

Putin's full aims remain obscure. He says he does not plan a military occupation, only to disarm Ukraine and remove its leaders.

But it is not clear how a pro-Russian leader could be installed without holding much of the country. Russia has floated no name of such a figure and none has come forward.

After Moscow denied for months it was planning an invasion, news that Putin had ordered one came as a shock to Russians accustomed to viewing their ruler of 22 years as a cautious strategist. Many Russians have friends and family in Ukraine.

Russia has cracked down on dissent and state media have relentlessly characterised Ukraine as a threat, but thousands of Russians took to the streets to protest against the war. Hundreds were swiftly arrested.

As reports of the Russian invasion in Ukraine continue to emerge, the toll the military occupation is taking on civilians is becoming clearer. New footage released on Friday shows an armored vehicle, which multiple sources claim is Russian, driving down a highway, swerving out of its way to run over a civilian vehicle driving in the opposite direction.

The tank sits atop the vehicle, rocking back and forth, and people in the room from which the event is being filmed can be heard screaming in horror. Gunfire can be heard in the background.

Miraculously, separate footage, purporting to be of the same car, shows a man trapped in the driver’s seat but still alert. The vehicle is surrounded by others attempting to peel away the metal to free the driver. The extent of the man’s injuries and his current condition are unknown.

The Sun reports that the armored vehicle is a Strela-10 with anti-aircraft guns, a military vehicle used by both the Russian and Ukrainian armies.

“I saw an armored vehicle and there was automatic fire,” Viktor Berbash, a Kyiv resident told the New York Post, adding that he believed the tank deliberately targeted the car. “It was not by chance, it was for fun, there was no need for this […] And it just ran into this car. Stopped, reversed over it again and drove on.”

The footage, which has been confirmed as authentic by Snopes, emerges as Russian forces close on the Ukrainian capital. Missiles have reportedly pounded the capital and the city has “entered into a defensive phase,” according to Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, reports the CBC.

In a statement posted on Twitter on Friday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, called on outside observers to ramp up sanctions against Russia saying that “not all possibilities for sanctions have been exhausted yet.”
