Russia makes false claims while blaming Ukraine for Kramatorsk railway station attack

On April 8, missiles landed near Kramatorsk railway station, killing dozens of people and injuring more than 100. The exact scale of casualties is still being investigated. According to local authorities, at least four children died. One of the missiles found on the scene had the phrase “За детей” (“for the children”) scrawled on it. While the phrase is open to interpretation, some have speculated that it was intended to mean “for the children of Russia,” and thus part of Russia’s attempt to paint Ukraine as the aggressor.

Ukrainian authorities had urged residents of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, including the city of Kramatorsk, to evacuate while it was still possible. Ukraine brought in multiple trains to bring residents away from the conflict, but the evacuation faced problems. On April 7, for example, three evacuation trains got stuck after Russia bombed railways near Barvinkove, the primary route westward from Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. The trains eventually departed after a delay of several hours. Meanwhile, buses from Vuhledar came under fire during an evacuation.

At least six trains were scheduled to depart Kramatorsk on April 8, each leaving the station as soon as they reached capacity.

Russia tried to blame Ukraine for attacking its own citizens. Russian Telegram channel Siloviki prematurely published information that Russians are “working on a cluster of armed forces of Ukraine at Kramatorsk railway station” and celebrated casualties among Ukrainian combatants. A few minutes after the initial post, they edited it, presumably after reports of civilian casualties proliferated. In the edited post, they said that when the Kramatorsk railway station was hit, “It was possibly a Tochka-U [missile] that the Armed Forces of Ukraine use.” Both posts were subsequently deleted, but the original post and the edited message were archived as a forwarded message on another pro-Kremlin channel. Another pro-Kremlin Telegram channel, Veteran Notes, published an ominous message on the evening of April 7, suggesting people who evacuate from Kramatorsk and Sloviansk not use railway transport.

Kremlin-owned mainstream media picked up the narrative and continued claiming Ukraine had attacked its own civilians, insisting that Russia does not use the Tochka-U missile system. While it might not be on official lists of Russian equipment, researchers previously spotted footage of Tochka-U systems being deployed in Belarus over the course of March, disproving Russia’s claims of not using them.

Ukraine accuses Russia of using mobile crematoria in Mariupol

On April 6, the Mariupol City Council released a statement on Telegram accusing Russian forces of using mobile crematoria to cover up war crimes. According to the council’s statement, Russian leadership ordered troops to destroy evidence of crimes in Mariupol following the public backlash against the Bucha massacre. They alleged that Konstantin Ivashchenko, the self-appointed separatist mayor of Mariupol, coordinates the mobile crematoria with the help of local special brigades recruited by Russians. The council speculated that Mariupol’s death toll could be in the tens of thousands, though the scale of civilian casualties remains unknown. Turkey has offered to help evacuate the wounded and dead from Mariupol by sea, but the initiative requires Moscow’s approval. The council suggested that the Kremlin has yet to sign off on the plan because of the high number of civilian casualties. Ukrainian authorities have not provided evidence of Russian forces using mobile crematoria in Mariupol.

Before the invasion, Ukraine and other countries noted the presence of Russian mobile crematoria near the Ukrainian border. On February 23, British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace announced that Russia would deploy mobile crematoria in Ukraine to hide evidence of casualties. On March 3, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the Russians had brought mobile crematoria into Ukraine to burn the bodies of their dead service members. Zelenskyy argued that the Kremlin would not want Russian families to know that their children died fighting in Ukraine.

In 2015, after the annexation of Crimea and the occupation of the Donbas region, Ukrainian authorities raised the issue of Russian mobile crematoria. On January 29 of that year, the head of the Ukraine Security Service stated that Russia brought several mobile crematoria into militant-held areas of Ukraine. At the time, US Reps. Mac Thornberry (R-TX) and Seth Moulton (D-MA) also noted that they had seen evidence of Russian mobile crematoria in Ukraine.

Kremlin-linked accounts promote Telegram channel spreading disinformation under the guise of fact-checking

The War on Fakes Telegram channel continues to amplify Russian disinformation under the guise of fact-checking, according to DFRLab monitoring. First reported on by the DFRLab in early March, War on Fakes now has over 720,000 subscribers, despite losing about 30,000 from March 19 to April 2. On April 3, the Russian Ministry of Defense amplified a post by War on Fakes to discredit information about the Bucha massacre.

The DFRLab has seen increased promotion of War on Fakes’ English-language content through new Telegram channels and Russian government Facebook accounts. Using the Meta-owned analysis tool CrowdTangle, the DFRLab examined accounts sharing links to War on Fakes’ English-language website. Throughout March and into April, Russian embassies and other government-affiliated accounts shared links to the website hundreds of times on Facebook. The combined reach of these accounts includes millions of users.

Although War on Fakes also has websites in Chinese, Arabic, French, and Spanish, none of these URLs were shared as widely; however, there were at least a few shares by Russian embassy accounts for each of these other language options.

The War on Fakes Telegram channel has also begun promoting a similar channel called “For the Truth,” which describes itself as “created to refute fakes and bring the truth to the West in their language.” The channel posts in Russian and English, and appears to be writing longer-form articles, which it shares via the web publishing tool Telegra.ph. One of War on Fakes’ secondary channels also publishes long-form articles via Telegra.ph in Russian. For the Truth admits that they coordinate with War on Fakes in some of their posts.

The DFRLab also identified what appears to be state-organized promotion of War on Fakes through Russia’s social media platform VKontakte. Hundreds of accounts and pages shared identical copy-and-pasted versions of a post promoting War on Fakes to Russian parents; most of the posts were published on March 9 and 10. The post’s text includes an emotional appeal to parents about the safety of their children and the need to protect them from false information about the war.

A significant portion of the pages sharing this post are government-funded schools or clubs, including the Young Guard program of Murmansk and numerous secondary schools, kindergartens, and preschools. The DFRLab has previously witnessed municipal VK accounts being used to justify the invasion of Ukraine. Other groups sharing the text include a step aerobics group, the Karate Federation of Murmansk, and a youth soccer organization. The DFRLab also identified another grouping of local government and news accounts sharing a different copied-and-pasted text promoting War on Fakes. This data set includes thirty separate accounts that all shared posts on February 27 within an hour of each other. Included in the posts was a video—which appears to have been taken down—refuting the claim that a Russian rocket hit an apartment building in Ukraine.

Screenshot of the same post shared by two different accounts on February 27. The posts have been auto-translated. (Sources: VK.com/archive, left; VK.com/archive, right)

There appears to be some level of coordinated behavior behind these posts. When considering that the accounts have a connection to the Russian government, this provides evidence that the Kremlin is connected, or at the very least promoting, the War on Fakes operation.

Inconsistent messages from Russia on the use of VPNs

Over the last several weeks, virtual private networks (VPNs) have become a popular tool to help Russian internet users connect to Western online platforms blocked by the Kremlin. In mid-March, several outlets began reporting on the increased demand for VPNs in Russia. According to WIRED, “Almost a million people from Russia had signed up since the war started, 20 times the usual rate.” Pro-Kremlin outlet RBC.ru also noted that the sudden proliferation of VPNs likely explained why Russian use of western social media platforms had not dropped off entirely.

The Kremlin has not been supportive of the recent surge in VPN use, but messaging and enforcement has been inconsistent, as can be seen in this timeline put together by the DFRLab:

March 15: Alexander Khinshtein, Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Information Politics, stated that twenty VPN services had been blocked in Russia, and federal censor Roskomnadzor would continue blocking others.

March 17: TASS published a report by the cybersecurity firm Group-IB, which stated that blocking VPNs is “a very abstract task” and represents a technological challenge.

March 18: The Russian Fund for the Development of Digital Economy misleadingly “warned” Russian internet users that VPN services are a threat to their data security.

March 21: Russian outlets reported that many blocked VPN services continue to work in Russia, but at a slower speed.

March 22: Alexander Khinshtein stated that a legislative ban on VPNs was not being considered in Russia.

March 22: Andrei Klishas, head of the Federation Council Committee on Constitutional Legislation and State Building, stated there would be no punishment for using VPNs, even if the services are officially are banned.

Tracking Russian mercenaries in Ukraine

Kremlin-backed Wagner Group mercenaries have been documented for the first time in Ukraine, after reports stating that over 1,000 fighters had being deployed in the war. Germany’s foreign intelligence service, the Bundesnachrichtendienst, intercepted Russian communications, which according to Der Spiegel suggested that “members of the Russian mercenary unit called the Wagner Group played a leading role in the atrocities in Ukraine.” The group became infamous for its atrocities in Syria and other conflict zones.

Recently surfaced images suggest that Wagner forces are back in Ukraine, where there are fears they may commit war crimes. (Source: @grey_zone/Archive)

One of the individuals seen in the photos appears to be Yan Petrovskiy a.k.a. Velikyi Slavyan, serving in Wagner’s Rusich unit. In 2020, the DFRLab consulted with Norwegian journalists from NRK.no to identify him in Syria. Despite his efforts to conceal himself with a blurred face, Petrovskiy can be identified through distinctive features such as tattoos on his wrists, as well as his black watch, the side arm on his leg, and a “Valknut” patch on his chest made of three interlocking triangles. The Valknut, also known as the “knot of the slain,” represents the afterlife and is commonly used by the far right.

Meanwhile, according to the additional reporting, Rusich unit commander Aleksey “Fritz” Milchakov was recently wounded, and Yan Petrovsky is reportedly now in charge.

Amid reports of looting, Russian soldiers may be stealing civilian cars

The monitoring group Belaruski Gayun published a new investigation on April 8 alleging that Russian soldiers are driving stolen Ukrainian vehicles. After receiving multiple requests from Ukrainian residents seeking help to find their stolen cars, Belaruski Gayun investigated civilian cars marked with a “V,” a symbol used by Russian troops to identify friendly forces. They discovered multiple cars in Belarus with this symbol and concluded that at least some of the vehicles were likely stolen from Ukrainian residents.

Belaruski Gayun spotted civilian cars without registration plates that were part of a large convoy of Russian military equipment. One of the cars in the convoy featured the logo of Havrylivski Kurchata (“Havryliv Chickens”), a domestic Ukrainian brand sold by the agriculture holding company Agromars.

Meanwhile, Russian Mediazona published a story about Dmytro Mayboroda, a Ukrainian mobile app developer, who lived under Russian occupation in Bervitsa, Kyiv Oblast. To ensure Russian soldiers would not steal his personal phone, he gave them phones he uses for app testing. After the withdrawal of Russian troops, Dmytro checked the phones locations and found out that more than one of them was now in Russia, including one he geolocated to a Russian military hospital in Dolgoprudny, Moscow Oblast.

Details: Ukrzaliznytsia reported that trains will not stop at Kramatorsk station. An evacuation route from Slovyansk to Uzhhorod by train №45 is currently planned.

Trains № 274, 276, 278, and 92 are expected to depart for Lviv, Chernivtsi, Ternopil, and Odessa, respectively.

The trains will be departing as soon as they are full. The time is not publicly announced due to security concerns.

The mayor of Kramatorsk is convinced that all 4,000 civilians who were at the Kramatorsk railway station at the time of the attack could have been killed if the rocket hit the station building, rather than exploding in the air.

He thinks that the main goal of the attack was to sow panic and disrupt the Ukrainian government’s plans to safely evacuate local residents.

Honcharenko said that several of the 100 people who had been injured in the attack had their limbs torn off in the explosion.

Background:

At 10:30 on 8 April Russian troops deployed a Tochka-U complex to carry out cluster shelling on the Kramatorsk railway station: 39 people were killed in the attack, including children, another 100 were wounded.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine responded to the attack by urging the world to react strongly, because unpunished evil will cause even more suffering in the future.

The chairman of the Russian metals firm Rusal has called for an impartial investigation into the killing of civilians in Bucha.

What happened? Shocking images of the carnage in Bucha were captured by Agence France-Presse on Saturday, the same day Ukraine declared the town liberated from Russian troops. Accounts of alleged Russian atrocities are emerging as its forces retreat from areas near Kyiv following a failed bid to encircle the capital.

The town of Bucha has endured five weeks of near-constant firefights. Now officials and human rights groups are blaming the civilian deaths on the departed Russian forces.

“Reports from the Ukrainian city of Bucha shocked us. We believe that this crime should be thoroughly investigated. We support an objective and impartial investigation of this crime and call for severe punishment for the perpetrators. No matter how hard it may seem in the context of ongoing information war,” Rusal Chairman Bernard Zonneveld said in a statement earlier this week.

Zonneveld’s statement did not address who may be responsible for the atrocities but went on to say that “such incidents make this terrible tragedy all the more traumatic.”

“We all wish an early end to this fratricidal conflict, which destroys lives, families and entire cities. And we want those responsible for such crimes to be punished appropriately,” the statement reads.

Zonneveld, a Dutch citizen, added that Rusal is calling for an early peaceful resolution of this conflict “to preserve priceless human lives and return to normalcy.”

The founder of Rusal, Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska, who has called for peace in the past, said on Telegram last week that the war is “madness” and could have already been resolved through negotiations.

10 Apr 2022 00.35 Eight Russian attacks thwarted in Donetsk and Luhansk, Ukraine says The Ukrainian military has just published its latest operational report as of 6am this morning. Officials claim Russian forces are attempting to break through the Ukrainian defences in Izum in Kharkiv, east Ukraine, by relocating additional units to the area while also attempting to establish full control over the city of Mariupol. A partial blockade of Kharkiv and shelling of the city continues, Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces said. The “constant arrival of wounded [Russian] soldiers” is putting strain on medical staff and overwhelming medical supplies, the report added.

In the absence of a stable supply of spare parts and units, Russian troops are forced to “work around the clock” to restore and repair equipment, officials claimed. In the Luhansk region, the measures of Russian-occupation administrations on forced mobilisation of the population in temporarily occupied territories are being strengthened.

According to the report, in the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, Ukrainian soldiers thwarted eight Russian attacks, destroyed four tanks, eight units of armoured vehicles and 13 air targets including three aircraft, one helicopter, five UAVs and four winged missiles.

10 Apr 2022 23.55 Finland is preparing for a potentially historic decision “before midsummer” on whether to apply to join Nato as a deterrent against Russian aggression. The Nordic nation of 5.5 million has traditionally been militarily non-aligned, in part to avoid provoking its eastern neighbour, with which it shares a 1,300km (830 mile) border. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has seen public support for joining Nato double from 30 to 60%, according to a series of polls. “Never underestimate the capacity of Finns to take rapid decisions when the world changes,” former Finnish prime minister Alexander Stubb told AFP. Himself a long-time Nato advocate, Stubb now believes Finland making a membership application is “a foregone conclusion” as Finns re-evaluate their relationship with their neighbour. Next week a government-commissioned national security review will be delivered to parliament, the Eduskunta, to help Finnish MPs make up their own minds, before it is put to a vote. “We will have very careful discussions but not taking any more time than we have to,” Prime Minister Sanna Marin told a news conference on Friday. “I think we will end the discussion before midsummer,” she added. “My guess is that the application will be filed sometime during the month of May” in time for the June Nato summit in Madrid, Stubb said.



10 Apr 2022 23.05 Here is a little more information on what we know about Putin’s appointment of a new general to direct his war effort in Ukraine. Army Gen. Alexander Dvornikov, commander of Russia’s Southern Military District, has been named theatre commander of Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine, according to CNN who cited a US official and a European official. It speaks to a Russian acknowledgement that it is going extremely badly and they need to do something differently,” the European official said. A new assault is now expected to focus on the Donbas region, instead of multiple fronts. Dvornikov, 60, was the first commander of Russia’s military operations in Syria, after Putin sent troops there in September 2015 to back the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. During Dvornikov’s command in Syria from September 2015 to June 2016, Russian aircraft backed the Assad regime and its allies as they laid siege to rebel-held eastern Aleppo, bombarding densely populated neighbourhoods and causing major civilian casualties. The city fell to Syrian government forces in December 2016. Commander of the Southern Military District Alexander Dvornikov is believed to have been named theatre commander of Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine. Photograph: Kommersant Photo Agency/REX/Shutterstock Russian forces have used a similarly heavy-handed approach in parts of Ukraine, striking residential buildings in major cities and demolishing much of the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. “We will see how effective that proves to be,” the European official said. “The Russian doctrine, the Russian tactics remain pretty much as they’ve been since Afghanistan.” “They do things in the same old way,” the official added. Former UK ambassador to Russia, Sir Roderic Lyne, told Sky News on Saturday Moscow has appointed a new general with a “pretty savage track record in Syria to try to at least gain some territory in Donetsk that Putin could present as a victory.”

10 Apr 2022 21.57 Ukraine bans all imports from Russia Ukraine has banned all imports from Russia, one of its key trading partners before the war with annual imports valued at about $6 billion, and called on other countries to follow suit. “Today we officially announced a complete termination of trade in goods with the aggressor state,” Ukraine’s minister for economic development and trade, Yulia Svyrydenko, said in a statement on Saturday. From now on, no Russian Federation’s products will be able to be imported into the territory of our state. The enemy’s budget will not receive these funds, which will reduce its potential to finance the war. Such a step of Ukraine can serve as an example for our Western partners and stimulate them to strengthen sanctions against Russia, including the implementation of the energy embargo and isolation of all Russian banks.” Since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, exchange of goods and services between the two neighbouring countries has been virtually non-existent, but Saturday’s move makes the termination of imports a law.



10 Apr 2022 21.45 Without oil embargo, Russia has 'sense of impunity', Zelenskiy says We have some more detail from Zelenskiy’s earlier late-night address. The Ukrainian president urged for “more painful restrictions” on Russia’s cash flow, primarily upon oil and gas. First of all this applies to the oil business. The democratic world can definitely give up Russian oil and make it toxic to all other states. Oil is one of the two sources of Russian self-confidence, their sense of impunity.” Zelenskiy also pushed for gas sanction, saying over time this “will also be shut down”. “It’s just inevitable. Not only for safety, but also for environmental reasons,” he added.

10 Apr 2022 21.03 Nato is working on plans for a permanent military presence on its border in an effort to battle future Russian aggression, The Telegraph is reporting, citing Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. Nato was “in the midst of a very fundamental transformation” that will reflect “the long-term consequences” of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s actions, Stoltenberg said in an interview with the newspaper. “What we see now is a new reality, a new normal for European security. Therefore, we have now asked our military commanders to provide options for what we call a reset, a longer-term adaptation of Nato,” it cited Stoltenberg as saying. Stoltenberg, who recently said he would extend his term as head of the alliance by a year, also said in the interview that decisions on the reset would be made at a Nato summit to be held in Madrid in June.





10 Apr 2022 20.57 Today so far It is 4am on Sunday in Ukraine as the country prepares for a feared escalation in attacks in the east and evacuations continue. During a surprise visit to the capital on Saturday, Britain’s prime minister Boris Johnson pledged more military and economic assistance for Ukraine.

10 Apr 2022 20.11 Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said he is “deeply disappointed and saddened” by the behaviour of his old friend Russian President Vladimir Putin over the Ukraine invasion. “I cannot and I do not want to hide that I am deeply disappointed by the behaviour of Vladimir Putin,” Berlusconi told a public meeting in Rome. “I’ve known him about twenty years ago and he always seemed to me to be a democrat and a man of peace,” the 85-year-old billionaire continued. Berlusconi, who served as head of the Italian government three times between 1994 and 2011, had previously refrained from publicly criticising Putin. When he was in power, Berlusconi maintained friendly personal ties with the Russian president, going so far as to invite him on vacation to his luxurious villa in Sardinia. “Faced with the horror of the massacres of civilians in Bucha and other places, real war crimes, Russia can not deny its responsibilities,” he said Saturday.
