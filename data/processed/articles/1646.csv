At least 12 people have been killed and 33 others wounded in a rocket attack on the regional administration building in the southern port city of Mykolaiv in Ukraine, local authorities have said.

Russian forces struck the nine-storey building at 8:45am (05:45 GMT) on Tuesday, destroying its central section from the first to the ninth floor, the State Emergency Service (SES) said on its Telegram channel.

Thirty-three of those wounded were pulled from the rubble, it said, adding that search and rescue operations were continuing.

Video and images posted on social media by regional administrator Vitaliy Kim showed thick plumes of smoke billowing in the sky and a massive hole in the building.

Since the invasion of Ukraine began on February 24, Russian forces have attacked Ukraine‚Äôs southern ports including Kherson, Odesa, Mykolaiv and Mariupol as they try to cut Ukraine off from the Black Sea and establish a land corridor from Russia to Crimea, the peninsula Russia seized in 2014.

Al Jazeera‚Äôs Stefanie Dekker, reporting from Mykolaiv, said the atmosphere in the southern port city was ‚Äúvery tense‚Äù following the attack.

‚ÄúYou can see a lot of the windows of the apartments here and in the surrounding area have been blown out,‚Äù Dekker said from the scene of the bombing.

‚ÄúWe arrived here about an hour after that strike. There was another air raid siren and people were panicking. We saw rescue workers running away from the site, and then we all went into a shelter,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúWe spoke to one lady who burst into tears, saying ‚ÄòI cannot deal with this anymore; it‚Äôs constant‚Äô.‚Äù

‚Äú[Ukraine] has held off a ground offensive for weeks but of course, Russia controls the skies and if it‚Äôs shelling, from the sea, from the ground, [and carrying out] air strikes ‚Ä¶ that does put ground troops at a disadvantage,‚Äù Dekker said.

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ‚Äúspecial military operation‚Äù to disarm its neighbour. It denies targeting civilians and did not comment on the strike on Mykolaiv.

MYKOLAIV, Ukraine ‚Äì At least three people were killed and 22 wounded on Tuesday, March 29, when a rocket struck the regional administration building in the southern Ukrainian port city of Mykolaiv, the Ukrainian emergencies service said.

In an online post, it said 18 of the wounded had been pulled from the rubble by rescue workers who continue to work at the scene.

An image showed a large hole in the side of the building. On Tuesday, Reuters witnesses saw the destruction from a distance and ambulances and fire engines heading to the scene. The area was cordoned off by Ukrainian authorities.

Regional governor Vitaly Kim, a steadfast Putin critic, only survived because he overslept and was running late for work.

Three bodies have been pulled out of the wreckage and 18 of the wounded were recovered by rescue workers.

Several members of the Ukrainian army remain unaccounted for, according to AFP.

Kim wrote on Facebook: 'The regional administration building was hit. We're clearing the rubble. My office was hit.

'Eight civilians are still under the rubble. We hope to be able to get them out. We are also looking for three soldiers.'

The artillery strike reportedly happened as government workers streamed into the office building.

Financial Times Moscow bureau chief Max Seddon tweeted: 'A Russian airstrike took out the local government offices in Mikolayiv, southern Ukraine this morning as people were coming to work.'

Mykolaiv is about 70 miles east of Odesa, up the Southern Bug (Pivdennyi Buh) river.

It has become a frontier in Russia's invasion of Ukraine as Putin seeks to gain an access route between Crimea and target city Odesa.

Taking Odesa would mean Russia controls Ukraine's largest coastal town - and the country's only deep-water port.

Yet an effective counter-offensive by Ukrainian troops in nearby Kherson has pushed the frontline away from Mykolaiv and back towards Crimea.

Donald, 69, a retired Canadian postman living in Mykolaiv, told AFP he considers the port town 'lucky' so far.

He said: 'I was having breakfast in my apartment. I heard a whoosh then a boom and my windows rattled.

'It's scary. We have been lucky here in Mykolaiv. We haven't had that many explosions in the centre of the city.'

Despite coming under bombardment from Moscow's forces for more than a week, Ukraine's forces in Mykolaiv have foiled a Russian advancement.

Most people inside the building escaped injury - but at least a dozen were killed or entrapped

Governor Kim said last week some Russian forces were pushed back to Kherson and that Moscow's armies have resorted to shelling the city indiscriminately, striking civilian centres.

But the medieval tactics have not diminished the resolve of the people of Mykolaiv, who have stopped Russian forces moving into the city itself.

He said last Monday: 'The forces that they sent, they thought they'd easily march through here because this was a region that didn't have enough military presence,' he told the newspaper.

'But we've showed them the opposite, with our soldiers and our civilian defence, that they have no business roaming around on our land.'

Kim has become the figurehead of Mykolaiv's resistance and has been likened among locals to president Zelensky.

Kim addresses more than 700,000 Telegram followers every few hours in a bid to inspire the city to fight back against its would-be occupiers.

He begins every video: 'Good day, we are from Ukraine' and has derided the Russian army as 'dumb'.

'They go from one direction and get bashed, they go from another direction and get bashed and then go from a third direction and get bashed as well,' he said in one address.

Although Ukrainian forces have pushed back in much of the south, Mariupol remains under severe threat of a Russian takeover in the coming days. These buses were placed as a barrier

Many residential buildings are just shells of what they once were, while the city's streets are littered with signs of warfare.

In the eastern Inhulskyi district of the city, an unexploded artillery rocket was seen sticking up from the pavement, with a traffic cone planted to warn motorists.

Glass litters the streets from shattered glass, and civilian defenders patrol with guns.

In the city's vast cemetery, another unexploded rocket burrowed into the ground nearly up to its fins.

A good part of the city's 500,000 pre-war residents have fled - mostly towards Odesa. Those that remain are determined to hold out.

In the Kulbakino district, which includes several blocks of residential buildings, the population has fallen from 12,000 to fewer than 1,000, according to Alexander Zadera, 56.

He said: 'We've got used to eating with that sort of background noise.

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area ‚Äî more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been ‚Äúwiped off the face of the earth.‚Äù

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade ‚Äúkamikaze‚Äù drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn‚Äôt even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

The wounded were pulled from the rubble by rescue workers, who continue to work at the scene, the emergencies service said in an online post.

Footage from the state rescue service showed a gaping hole in a side of the building, with firefighters extinguishing a fire where the rocket hit and the wounded being put onto ambulance stretchers.

There was a blood patch visible in the debris, and shattered glass and upturned furniture strewn on the floor in the offices inside the building.

""This is just a nightmare. A girl died on my floor. What can I say? Are you kidding? I hugged her, two minutes passed, and she passed,"" said a woman who was helped out of the building by rescuers.

""They destroyed half of the building, hit my office,"" regional governor Vitaliy Kim said.

Russian forces have attacked Ukraine's southern ports including Kherson, Odesa, Mykolaiv and Mariupol as they try to cut Ukraine off from the Black Sea and establish a land corridor from Russia to Crimea, the peninsula Russia seized in 2014.

Kim said there was an upside to the strike - it suggested Russia had given up trying to take over the city.

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"" to disarm its neighbour. It denies targeting civilians and did not comment on the strike on Mykolaiv.

Ukraine and the West say Russian President Vladimir Putin launched an unprovoked invasion.

Describing the strike, Natalia Novikova, 57, an employee in the department of health in the local administration, said it was ""so noisy, people were very afraid. People all ran into the hallway and some are still sitting there because they're still scared. After that the (air-raid) sirens went off.""
