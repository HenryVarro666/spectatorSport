Brussels and Washington moved to impose further sanctions on Moscow, targeting finance and business. ""Putin chose this war,"" said US President Joe Biden, warning that Russia would bear the consequences.

A day of fighting saw clashes and casualties reported around the country including near the capital Kyiv. Ukrainian officials said Russia had taken control of the Chernobyl nuclear plant. Civilians have been seen trying to flee major cities.

The assault ordered by Vladimir Putin began overnight, with Russian forces invading Ukraine by land, air and sea. The Russian leader warned other countries that any attempt to interfere would lead to ""consequences you have never seen in history"".

World leaders decried the start of a Russian offensive that could cause massive casualties and looks to be designed to topple Ukraine’s democratically elected government.

The city came under a sustained barrage of airstrikes this morning, leaving craters in the street.

Russian forces launched a wide-ranging assault on Ukraine the day before, sending tanks across the border and bombarding the country with airstrikes, following an order from Russian President Vladimir Putin for a “special military operation.”

Putin has urged Ukrainian troops to lay down their arms and vowed to retaliate against countries who interfered with Russia’s actions. NATO leaders said Friday that the alliance was deploying more troops to Eastern Europe.

World leaders have condemned the invasion and promised to retaliate with increased sanctions. On Thursday, U.S. President Joe Biden announced that he was authorizing new sanctions that would “impose a severe cost on the Russian economy both immediately and over time” and on Friday, the U.S. confirmed that it would join the U.K. and E.U. in sanctioning Putin directly.”

“This is a dangerous moment for all of Europe, for freedom around the world,” Biden said at a press conference on Thursday afternoon. “This was never about genuine security concerns on (Russia’s) part. It was always about naked aggression, about Putin’s desire for empire by any means necessary.”

Here’s the situation at the moment.

What’s happening on the ground in Ukraine?



Russian troops have reached the northern parts of the capital Friday and the Associated Press (AP) reported that gunfire has been heard near the government quarter in Central Kyiv. The mayor of Kyiv says the Ukrainian capital has entered into “a defensive phase,” a Reuters journalist tweeted.

On Friday morning, Ukrainian interior ministry advisor Anton Herashchenko said on Telegram that attacks on Kyiv with cruise and ballistic missiles had resumed, and that he had heard two powerful explosions.

Ukraine’s defense ministry on Friday called for people of all ages to take up arms against Russia. Interior Ministry adviser Vadym Denysenko said 18,000 machine guns “have been handed out in Kyiv to all volunteers,” the BBC reported, and citizens are being advised to make petrol bombs.

Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko appeared Friday on CNN with a kalashnikov, saying that he and his battalion were prepared to hold out “forever.”

“We don’t have any heavy artillery, we don’t have tanks, we don’t have an armed personnel carrier because we launched this process just a couple days ago,” Poroshenko said.

Poland’s Minister of National Defense tweeted Friday that a convoy of military aid had reached Ukraine, but did not specify more details about the nature and amount of assistance.

The UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi tweeted Friday that more than 50,000 Ukrainian refugees have fled the country over the last 48 hours—mostly heading towards Poland and Moldova. The Ukrainian Railway Company announced Friday that several special evacuation trains would take civilians from Kyiv to western parts of Ukraine.

The invasion of Ukraine began in the pre-dawn hours of Thursday. AP said that Russia sent in troops and tanks from the west, north and south and unleashed a barrage of airstrikes across the country.

Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address late Thursday that 137 Ukrainians, including 10 military officers, had been killed and more than 300 people were wounded. Airstrikes alone killed at least 25 civilians and injured 102, the Guardian reported, citing U.N. human rights office spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani.

The websites of Ukraine’s defense, foreign and interior ministries also experienced a wave of damaging cyberattacks Thursday morning, according to an AP report. Cybersecurity researchers said that unidentified attackers had infected hundreds of computers with destructive malware, some in neighboring Latvia and Lithuania.

Zelensky has declared martial law. He said that he had spoken to Biden following the attacks. He also called on Russians to protest Putin’s move and thousands heeded the call, taking to the streets Thursday to demonstrate against their country’s decision to invade Ukraine. More than 1,700 people across 53 Russian cities were detained, according to the AP.

According to the BBC, the hashtag “No To War” has been trending on Russian-language social media. On Friday, Russian tennis star Andrey Rublev wrote “no war please” on a TV camera in a tournament in Dubai.

Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba called on Twitter for the world to place “devastating sanctions on Russia” immediately.

According to AP, the Russian military said it had struck Ukrainian air bases and other military assets with “no threat to civilian population.” Zelensky challenged that claim on Friday, calling it “a lie” and sad that Russian attacks were hitting military and civilian targets. Kyiv’s mayor Vitaly Klitschko said a rocket hit an apartment building in the city.

Late on Thursday, a Ukrainian presidential adviser told AP that Ukraine had lost control of the Chernobyl nuclear site, after a fierce battle with Russian troops. The power plant is the site of the world’s worst nuclear disaster.

“After the absolutely senseless attack of the Russians in this direction, it is impossible to say that the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is safe,” the adviser, Myhailo Podolyak, said.

And on Friday, Ukrainian ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova said during a press conference in Washington that 92 members of the power plant’s operational personnel were being held hostage by Russian forces.

Markarova also said during the press conference that Russia hit an orphanage in Kyiv that was occupied by children. “It’s only with God’s help that those 50 children were not hurt,” she said.

“We have many people right now not living their day-to-day lives but actually spending the majority of the time in the basements or taking shelter in the metro stations or other safe locations,” Markarova said.

The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency has called for “maximum restraint” in order to ensure the “safety and security of its nuclear power plants.”

The Russian Defense Ministry says its forces have taken control of a key airfield near Kyiv, the BBC reported, citing Russia’s Interfax news agency.

Elsewhere, many sought shelter. The Guardian journalist Luke Harding said that he had taken shelter in his basement in Kyiv and that air raid sirens could be heard in the capital. Videos circulating on social media showed heavy traffic around the city as people attempted to leave. The Kyiv subway was reportedly being used as a bomb shelter.

Fears over conflict in Ukraine had already roiled global financial markets in recent weeks. On Thursday, Asian and European stock markets slumped and Brent crude oil prices surged to more than $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014 in response to the attacks.

Why is Russia taking action in Ukraine?

The Russian leader has accused the U.S. and its allies of ignoring Russia’s demand to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO.

In a televised address on Thursday before the assault, Putin also claimed that the attack was necessary to protect civilians in the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. The areas in eastern Ukraine are controlled by Moscow-backed separatists and were recognized by Moscow this week as independent republics.

The U.S. says Russia’s moves were intended to create a pretext for a wider invasion, and the range of the attacks includes targets well outside of eastern Ukraine.

Zelensky said that he had asked for a call with Putin late Wednesday, but that the Kremlin did not respond. In a direct appeal to Russia’s citizens, he warned “If we come under attack, if we face an attempt to take away our country, our freedom, our lives and the lives of our children, we will defend ourselves. When you attack us, you will see our faces, not our backs.”

What happens next in the Ukraine crisis?

Already several countries, including the U.S. and Australia, have pledged new sanctions against Russia. “The collective impact of sanctions will squeeze Russian access to finance and technology [and] degrade its industrial capacity for years to come,” Biden said Thursday, adding that he estimated that international coordination would help cut off more than half of Russia’s high-tech imports. He stressed, however, that sanctions would “take time” to have their desired effect.

Following the entry of Russian troops into Kyiv, NATO announced it was deploying more troops to Eastern Europe.

“We will make all deployments necessary to ensure strong and credible deterrence and defence across the Alliance,” the 30 leaders said in a joint statement. “Our measures are and remain preventive, proportionate and non-escalatory.”

The military alliance added: “President Putin’s decision to attack Ukraine is a terrible strategic mistake, for which Russia will pay a severe price, both economically and politically, for years to come.”

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that Russia was open to talks with the Ukrainian government in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, a Russian ally. However, he said the talks would be about Ukraine declaring a “neutral status,” which would include “demilitarization.” This refers to Russia’s demand that Ukraine rules out joining NATO, according to the BBC.

Zelensky requested Friday that Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett mediate negotiations between Ukraine and Russia in Jerusalem, the New York Times reported. Yevgen Korniychuk, the Ukrainian ambassador to Israel, said that Israel didn’t yet provide a clear response about whether they would help, the Times reported.

Biden said that he had “no idea” what Putin was threatening when he said that any attempt to interfere in Ukraine would “lead to consequences you have never seen in history” in response to a reporter who asked whether the Russian president was implying a willingness to use nuclear weapons. Biden said that Putin has made clear that he has “much larger ambitions than Ukraine” and that he “wants to reestablish the Soviet Union.”

The European Union approved a sanctions package on Thursday, which will freeze Russian assets in the E.U. and block Russian banks from accessing European financial markets.

In a written statement issued on Thursday, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said that the organization, which has several members that border Ukraine, will do “all it takes” to protect and defend its allies—but he added that NATO has no plans to send any troops into the country.

The U.N. said Thursday that it would be freeing up $20 million for humanitarian aid for Ukraine. The World Health Organization also announced Thursday that it had released $3.5 million to buy and deliver urgent medical supplies; Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stressed the importance of allowing the health system to deliver essential medical care.

Zelensky urged world leaders on Thursday to provide defense assistance and to target Putin with all possible sanctions. Putin “has unleashed a war with Ukraine and the entire democratic world,” he said. “Together we must save Ukraine, save the democratic world, and we will do it,” the Ukraine president said.

2,e651daab-cf98-45a5-9e48-b6f1ca3487af,"['Ellen Ioanes', 'Anna Goldfarb', 'Laura Bult', 'Alex Abad-Santos', 'Keren Landman', 'Constance Grady', 'Feb']",2022-02-27 00:00:00,"After four days of fighting in Ukraine, it’s not going especially well for Russian forces. According to Ukraine’s defense ministry, Russia has lost about 4,300 troops and nearly 150 tanks, and both Kyiv, the capital, and Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, are still under Ukrainian control.

Casualty numbers are unverified and should be treated with some caution, but they’re still a sharp contrast to initial Russian expectations, which assumed the Russian armed forces’ greater numbers and access to more advanced weapons systems would result in a swift, relatively painless invasion. Ukrainian forces, however, have mounted a strikingly successful resistance.

In recent years, much has been made of Russia’s developing hybrid warfare, fusing conventional tactics like ground troops and air campaigns alongside information manipulation and electronic warfare like signal jamming. Nonetheless, on the information front, Russia seems to be losing the war; the sheer volume of video and information coming from Ukraine in real time, plus a young, social media-savvy president and broad, transparent intelligence sharing, have proved to be a powerful antidote to the Kremlin’s disinformation spin.

“It’s been interesting to watch in the last 48 hours, and good to see in many ways, that the Kremlin has lost control of the narrative, internationally, around this war,” Mason Clark, the lead Russia analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, a nonpartisan DC-based think tank, told Vox.

The conflict is also markedly different than other recent conflicts, such as those in Syria or Afghanistan. Despite the disparities between Russian and Ukrainian forces, it’s still a war between two formal militaries, as opposed to a decentralized insurgency.

Ukraine’s country-wide mobilization adds an additional element, with many civilians picking up weapons, learning to make Molotov cocktails, or simply confronting tanks in the road.

Clark spoke with Vox on February 26 about his observations of the conflict so far, how it compares with other recent conflicts, and the resources Russia is still holding in reserve.

The conversation, edited for length and clarity, is below.

Ellen Ioanes

Can you walk me through some of the changes and upgrades that the Russian armed forces have been working on in the past decade or two?

Mason Clark

So, the short answer is that actually a lot of their equipment has not changed. A lot of the Russian and Ukrainian forces are still fighting with roughly on-par equipment with each other. There’s some Russian units that have better equipment, newer tanks, that sort of thing. But on the whole, much of it due to just the sheer cost of replacing Russia’s old inventory of equipment and weaponry and munitions, even, means that they’re not that much different materially than they would have been in the beginning of the war in 2014.

The main thing that the Russian military has emphasized as really improving is, strangely enough, capabilities that we haven’t really seen them use in the war so far. One, electronic warfare, which we have not seen employed at scale. And two, a lot of various forms of new weapons, either cruise missiles or new fighters, and strategic bombers that Russian doctrine — what they say they would do in this sort of war — we haven’t actually seen.

And I can delve a little bit [into] why we think that is. It appears Putin has wildly miscalculated and had a, frankly, bad plan going into this of how quickly the Ukrainian military would collapse, and is still trying to avoid using these very damaging weapons of concentrated missiles and airstrikes to destroy Ukrainian defensive positions, to preserve his narrative of this not being a real war and not requiring that sort of use of firepower.

Ellen Ioanes

Right, sort of a diminishing expectation of the enemy that they’re up against.

Mason Clark

Exactly. And, of course, as we’ve now seen in the last 72 hours ... to be clear, it’s not just that the Russians are doing badly, it’s also that the Ukrainian military is doing very well, putting up a very, very stiff defense in several areas. But likely what we’re worried about here at ISW and watching on the team over the next 48 hours is when, and if, the Russians will recalibrate their approach and shift back into deploying additional forces forward, and using these much more damaging approaches as they start fighting through Kyiv or Kharkiv, or as they start to push forward into Zaporizhzhya [a city in southeastern Ukraine] — they’re approaching the outskirts [on Saturday]. As damaging as the strikes on Kyiv and other cities have been so far, we haven’t really seen the full capabilities that the Russian military has and can bring to bear, the way it has, for example, in Syria, or in fighting in Chechnya in the early 2000s.

Ellen Ioanes

Right, so speaking of earlier conflicts, there are a couple of similarities, or possible similarities — such as, what we’ve heard of the bombing of hospitals, and I feel like I have reason to believe that’s true — but will those tactics like we saw in Syria be possible in such a magnified, and very scrutinized, landscape as we’re working with now?

Mason Clark

They’re possible, and unfortunately I don’t think we can rule out that Russian forces will begin to carry out those strikes on a more overt scale, even though, [in the] last 24 hours the Ukrainian military has been reporting that Russian forces have been striking residential areas, just strictly to cause intimidation and terror and, probably, to force a collapse of the Ukrainian military — that hasn’t occurred at all.

But as you raised, even with all of the gaps, the fog of war, and that reporting on exact control of terrain and things like that, there is so much video emerging from the fighting on the ground and documentation of Russian actions, and particular violations against civilians and strikes on civilian targets, that in many ways, it’s been interesting to watch in the last 48 hours, and good to see, in many ways, that the Kremlin has lost control of the narrative internationally around this war.

Ellen Ioanes

So, I think another point to that, in terms of the information and what we’re able to see and document, a part of Russia’s hybrid warfare that I feel like everyone and their mom has been talking about for several years, doesn’t seem to be working here.

Mason Clark

No, and I would agree, and that’s been an interesting aspect of this. They have lost control of the narrative completely, even into Russian domestic audiences. I think Putin is facing more pushback than he anticipated. One of my colleagues, Katya, we ran an update on this last night. It’s interesting, Russian media is simply not portraying the war.

To date, they’re claiming that the only fighting that’s happening is around the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, the proxies that Russia recognized, and they’re not showing fighting across the country, they’re not showing any Russian casualties, and rather than showing Russian footage, they’re trying to take Ukrainian footage out of context and use that to portray the war. And even then, they’re facing large backlash from the population, and the early stirrings of what may cohere into a true anti-war movement, which would be quite the feat considering how built-up the Russian repressive apparatus has been the last few years.

On those wider hybrid methods, it seems that this has been, I would say, not necessarily a break from them, because we assess that this was not Putin’s first choice. This seems to be something he has been forced into after a long period of a buildup and trying to coerce demands out of both Ukraine and NATO, and in particular, I think US intelligence did a very good job, as well as with European allies, of exposing so many of what were more of those hybrid methods that the Kremlin was using throughout December to February.

For example, thinking of the multiple reports of Russian plans for a coup in Kyiv, and the fact that they even picked out the people that they wanted to take over the government, or US intelligence exposing in late January that the Russian military had filmed a fake video of civilians being killed by Ukrainian forces, that sort of thing. I think that there’s a very high likelihood that that’s how the Kremlin wanted this war to begin, with some sort of muddled thing that they were able to doctor and spin in the information space. But because so many of those were exposed, they’ve had to do this very overt, direct invasion of Ukraine.

Ellen Ioanes

Right, it seemed as though there were many attempts at narrative-spinning, from “Oh, Ukraine has always been a part of Russia, we’re the same people,” and then, abruptly, “Ukraine is committing genocide against Russian people,” which you can’t do if you’re the same people — you know, these sort of mixed messages.

Mason Clark

A nuance on that, that’s actually important to capture on how Putin is spinning this war at home is, the Kremlin and the Kremlin-run media is trying to draw a very sharp distinction between the Ukrainian population, which they seem to expect will greet Russia as liberators and Russia has no quarrel with them, and the regime in Kyiv, which they portray as being neo-Nazis and drug users. I do not know where that one came from. And it’s this interesting balance where I think it’s a mix of them trying to pitch to the Russian people that this is not a war against Ukraine, it’s a very targeted intervention to get rid of the regime.

But at the same time, we’re having this growing view that we, frankly, were wrong about how rational the Kremlin was, to be honest, and it seems very much that they seem to have drunk their own Kool-Aid, so to speak. They may have actually believed that all they needed to do was take out the government in Kyiv that they do see as this foreign-imposed fascist government, and the Ukrainian population would be completely okay with that, which is just, quite simply, as everyone is seeing, not the case.

Ellen Ioanes

Is that an indication that Putin is, maybe, cut off from reality a bit, if indeed that is the belief? Because I’m not sure, if we’re operating under the idea that he does believe that Ukrainians will welcome Russians with open arms, I don’t see that as the same sentiment or motivating idea as Chechnya or Georgia, where it was like, we have to bring these back into the fold, we have to conquer these areas. Can you draw that parallel at all?

Mason Clark

It’s a tricky one, because Chechnya was framed as more of a domestic terrorism issue, and Georgia — there are certainly some parallels in some of the broad strokes of defending a separatist enclave in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, of course, and comparing that to the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, but the framing is very much different. Even the 2008 war with Georgia was framed as a purely defensive measure to protect these enclaves. There was no framing at all of it being a war of reconquest or to bring Georgia back into the fold or anything like that, where this Ukraine conflict very much has been.

On your first point, I want to hesitate, because I don’t want to fall into the trap of armchair psychology, of ascribing a reason to it, but in short, yes, it does seem that something has shifted in Putin’s approach. It could be his way of thinking — the popular theory going around is that all of his isolation the last two years during Covid has really gotten to him; he seems to be listening to different people in his government than he used to, and there’s been a number of leaks — that haven’t been fully confirmed — that he’s not listening to proper military advice, and that Russian military officers are also unhappy with this plan and the war as a whole. I don’t think I can assess why, but I would agree, at minimum, that this is not the same Putin that we were watching two years ago.

Ellen Ioanes

Along with the mobilization of Ukrainian volunteers and civil society, there is a strong desire to fight and to work together in solidarity that you see in Ukraine, and people have been training for this for eight years. Of course, Russia has a much larger military, but I don’t know what their training looks like. Can you say how well-trained these troops are?

Mason Clark

That’s actually a very, very interesting question, and one of the strangest quirks of watching this offensive in motion, from a Russian doctrinal aspect, which is what I’ve spent the last few years studying — essentially their training and lessons learned from Syria and other conflicts. The short answer is this doesn’t make sense, this doesn’t follow Russian doctrine and everything that they should be doing, according to their own procedures.

At the lower end of the spectrum, [Russia is] still predominantly a conscript-based military. It has issues, and we’re seeing that now on the front line, with a lot of units surrendering. There’s been several reports of Russian troops being taken prisoner and basically telling Ukrainians, “We found out about this invasion three hours before you did. We thought we were actually on exercises, and then suddenly we were told to cross the border.”

There are good elements of the Russian military — particularly the First Guards Tank Army that’s based around Moscow, and we’ve seen some elements of them around eastern Ukraine, but much more importantly, we’re seeing a wide disparity between the units in the south moving north from Crimea, [which] are just functioning much, much better than those coming from the northeastern Ukrainian border and from Belarus.

And we think the reason behind that — and this is something we observed in the months leading up to this, and frankly thought that Putin was not going to launch this offensive — is that only the troops facing Donbas and Crimea, in the southern military district, were ready and actually exercising at a large scale — entire divisions and regiments were carrying out these exercises. All of the troops that were on the northeastern Ukrainian border and in Belarus were pulled from all across Russia. We’re seeing units that were based on the Pacific coast that have been pulled all the way into Belarus and are now being thrown into northern Ukraine, and they didn’t seem to have time to organize together, and form these cohesive command structures.

So now we’re seeing them run into problems with logistics, running out of fuel, bad maps, all sorts of other things. And that’s having costs for the Russian military. The frankly strange thing about this is that, to be glib about it, they should be smarter than this. Again, we assessed until about five days before this began, that there would be no way they would be launching an offensive from the northeast because they just weren’t postured to do it — but they seem to have gone ahead with those forces anyway, which definitely lends credence to the arguments that this very much has been a Putin decision, he’s not listening to good military advice.

Ellen Ioanes

That has occurred to me as well, in terms of the lack of use of their sea power. We have the story from Snake Island, and Russia has a much more powerful navy, so it’s very strange that that has not been exploited — or it’s strange to me, as an outsider.

Mason Clark

I would agree completely. And we haven’t necessarily seen Russian strikes to take out the Ukrainian Navy — there’s been some very minor skirmishing from patrol boats, really, but there hasn’t been much in terms of actual attacks. Now, the Russian Navy and particularly the Black Sea fleet and some of their vessels pulled in from the Mediterranean and even as far away as the Baltic, are certainly carrying out a blockade of Ukrainian ports and preventing Ukrainian ships from breaking out, but we haven’t seen them used, I think, for two reasons: One, the same point in general [why] the Russians have not used as much air power and airstrikes is, quite simply, trying to downplay this and not get to that level.

The second is, they may not have drawn up the plans and been prepared to. We also have not seen any use of Russian naval infantry, which is their equivalent of Marines, being deployed, which was a big thing that a lot of folks forecasted prior to the offensive. There’s very much been this concentration of this ground breakout from Crimea, over everything else. A middling hypothesis is we think they may just be trying to secure ports with these ground forces before being able to land and move vessels in to provide further fire support, because they don’t want to risk the cost of having a naval landing go wrong.

Amphibious landings are quite difficult in even the best of circumstances, and they probably would take heavy casualties if they tried to do any of the direct landings against Mariupol or Odesa or any of those other major coastal cities. But it has indeed been an interesting gap in the capabilities that they’ve used so far.

Ellen Ioanes

That also leaves room for escalation, then, too.

Mason Clark

Exactly, and I hate to have to end it on this point, but it’s been interesting watching the reporting of how well the Ukrainian military has been doing the last few days — and they have been doing very well, there have been a lot of Russian errors — but I wish I could say, “Therefore I think the Ukrainian military’s going to hold out.”

Sheer weight of numbers, and if the Russians do start using the resources that they have, are going to overwhelm the Ukrainian military at some point, almost no matter how badly [Russia runs] this campaign plan.

And there are so many assets that have not been put into play yet, that what we’re really going to be watching in the next 48 to 72 hours is if the Russians decide to change tack and start using those. Particularly as Russian forces move into Kyiv proper, because we haven’t seen the Russians use armor and heavy artillery against an urban target yet, and they absolutely have the capability to do so, if they decide to abandon the approach they seem to be taking: of not taking the hit in the information space, of destroying large swaths of Ukraine and killing civilians.

Ellen Ioanes

This seems like a war from a time forgotten, a little bit. It seems like a battle from World War II, in a way. It does seem like a very ordinary urban warfare, conventional military campaign.

Mason Clark

Sure, and there’s definitely aspects of that. I do think we’ve seen a number of key differences in, certainly, the pace of some of the fighting and the use of what we have seen in terms of artillery and air support, and some of the key differences of how covered this has been on social media, and the importance of these narratives.

But I do agree, it has been very interesting observing it as, other than [Operation Desert Storm in] 1991 and [the invasion of Iraq in] 2003, this large-scale, conventional warfare and sweeping armored offense — or not so sweeping, because the Russians haven’t been doing well — [we haven’t seen that] for decades and decades.",https://www.vox.com/2022/2/27/22953539/ukraine-invasion-putin-russia-baffling-war-strategy
3,e651daab-cf98-45a5-9e48-b6f1ca3487af,['Holly Ellyatt'],2022-02-23 00:00:00,"Russian President Vladimir Putin is center stage as Russia launches an invasion of its neighbor Ukraine. There have been multiple reports overnight of explosions, bombings and Russian military vehicles entering Ukraine from various parts of the border with Russia, with a growing number of casualties being counted on both sides. The invasion of Ukraine is an event that many close followers of the president have feared for months, and indeed, years. Putin had already gained the world's attention earlier this week after he ordered troops into two pro-Russian, breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine and recognizing them as independent states.

Western officials and analysts scoffed at Putin's claim that Russian troops sent into the region will act as ""peacekeepers,"" saying that the latest move could be a precursor to a larger invasion of Ukraine. Political analysts have been predicting that Russia could pull such a move for a while, given an ongoing conflict in the Donbas between separatists, backed by Russia, and Ukrainian troops. Nonetheless, Putin's actions now, with a larger-scale attack, come earlier and appear more wide-ranging than many expected. The Kremlin issued more statements on Thursday morning, saying Putin would decide how long the military operation would last ""based on its progress and aims."" Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, also told reporters that Ukraine needs to be ""liberated,"" but that ""nobody is talking about the occupation of Ukraine,"" according to Reuters. CNBC has a guide to what's going on in Ukraine and why it matters:

Why Ukraine?

Heightened fears of a military conflict between Russia and Ukraine have been present for some time, and eastern Ukraine has been the location of a proxy war between the two countries. Soon after Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, pro-Russian separatists proclaimed two republics in the eastern part of the country: the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic — much to the Ukrainian government's consternation.

Since then, there have been ongoing skirmishes and fighting in the region, which is known as the Donbas, between Ukraine's troops and separatists. Germany and France have tried to broker peace deals between Russia and Ukraine, known as the ""Minsk agreements."" And although the fighting in the Donbas has been punctuated by periods of cease-fire, both Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of violating the terms of the deals and fighting has resumed. The armed conflict in the Donbas, often described as ""war,"" has already had a high human cost, with 13,000 to 14,000 people believed to have been killed. An accurate gauge of the death toll is hard to reach, given the civil war-like nature of the conflict. On Tuesday, Putin told reporters that the ""the Minsk agreements were dead long before yesterday's [Monday's] recognition of the people's republics"" and again blamed Kyiv for their failure.

What has Russia done?

Russia has often denied it has backed separatists in eastern Ukraine but has been accused of supplying military hardware to rebels in a bid to undermine Ukraine's government, sovereignty and political stability. After its invasion and annexation of Crimea, which prompted international sanctions on Russia, Western officials feared Putin's eventual aim was to invade more parts of the country and to install a pro-Russia regime in Kyiv. Russia has repeatedly denied it plans to invade but the recent massing of more than 100,000 troops along the border with Ukraine, and more soldiers stationed in its ally Belarus for military drills, has only served to strengthen concerns that a full-scale Russian incursion is imminent.

Russia's recognition of the self-proclaimed republics in eastern Ukraine on Monday lends an official stamp to Moscow's support of rebels there, but it has already tried to ""Russify"" the region by offering Russian passports and citizenship to residents there. Political analysts saw the move in 2019 as a cynical precursor to an incursion because if Russia chose to invade, it could say it was only doing so to ""protect"" its citizens from Ukraine. Russian state media has already focused on Donbas residents fleeing the region in recent days, alleging this was due to shelling by Ukraine's military.

Signaling Russia is pursuing such a strategy, Putin justified ordering troops into eastern Ukraine on Tuesday by saying Moscow's recognition of the ""republics"" was ""dictated precisely by the fact that the Ukrainian leadership had publicly declared that they were not going to abide by these [Minsk] agreements."" ""What more is there to wait for?"" he said. What's more, when asked whether Russia recognized only the borders of the self-styled republics, or beyond and including the larger Donetsk and Luhansk regions in which they are located, Putin signaled it was the latter: ""With regard to the borders within which we will recognize these republics, we did recognize them, which means we recognized their foundational documents, including the Constitution, and the Constitution stipulates their borders within the Donetsk and Luhansk regions at the time when they were part of Ukraine.""

What does Putin want?

Essentially, the battle over Ukraine is a battle for influence and power. Ukraine's government, now under President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has pivoted toward the West in recent years, aspiring to join the EU and NATO and to move away from its post-Soviet orbit of Russia. Putin, meanwhile, has decried the dissolution of the Soviet Union as a catastrophe and over his 22-year rule in Russia he has sought to rebuild Russia's power base and sphere of influence over former Soviet states, like Belarus, Georgia and Ukraine — something of the jewel in the crown in the USSR, and a natural buffer state against Europe. Putin has often extolled the historical unity of Russia and Ukraine and did so again Monday when he ordered troops into the Donbas. Ukraine's drift toward the West aggravates Moscow because it does not want to see NATO, or the EU, expand eastward to incorporate Ukraine despite there being no imminent prospect of Ukraine becoming a member of either body.

In December, Russia demanded legal assurances that Ukraine would never be admitted to NATO but those demands were refused. Analysts have said Putin knew the demands would be rejected but was then able to say Russia's security concerns had been ignored, selling this to the Russian public via the media, most of which is pro-Putin because it is either state controlled or has links to the government. As such, it's no surprise that Russian state media has repeatedly blamed Ukraine and the West for aggravating tensions in the Donbas region, accusing both of spreading misinformation and of ignoring Russia's security demands. Russia's latest actions have drawn international condemnation, with the U.S., EU, Japan, Australia and the U.K. all announcing new sanctions on Russia, although the country has already lived under sanctions for its Crimea annexation, 2016 U.S. election interference, cyberattacks and more.

All-out war in mind?

Close watchers of Putin have long believed that Russia has prepared for more sanctions and that Moscow has a bigger plan in mind when it comes to Ukraine, a hypothesis apparently being proven by the latest events in Ukraine.",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/23/russia-why-is-there-conflict-in-east-ukraine-and-what-is-putin-endgame.html

Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Wednesday on Day 28:

Russian troops face major setback east of Kyiv and moving into defensive positions

In a significant movement, Ukraine's military forces have pushed back Russian forces east of Kyiv to 55 kilometers from the city center, according to a senior defense official.

For weeks, and as recently as Tuesday, Russian forces have been kept at bay approximately 20 to 30 kilometers from the center of the capital city.

The official said that Ukrainian forces near Bovary ""have been able to push the Russians back to about 55 kilometers east and northeast of Kyiv.""

The ability to push back Russian forces nearly twice as far as where they had been for weeks is in line with what the official had said on Tuesday were indications that in some areas Ukrainian forces were attempting to retake territory taken by Russia. ""Ukrainians are not only in some of these places up sufficiently defending they're going on the offense in some of these places and actually pushing the Russians backwards, or in the case of Kiev, they're, they're basically forcing them into a defensive position,"" the official said Wednesday.

The U.S. now assesses that Russian troops that have been stalled 12 to 15 kilometers north of the city are ""digging in"" and establishing defensive positions according to the official. ""They're forcing them into a defensive position"" the official told reporters on Wednesday. ""So it's not that they're not advancing, they're actually not trying to advance right now,"" said the official. ""They're taking more defensive positions.""

""We're starting to see him sort of dig in around Kyiv but really trying to go more on the offense than they have been, more energy applied, in that eastern part of Ukraine"" said the official.

Ukrainians pushing back Russian troops in Cherniviv

Meanwhile, Ukrainian troops in the city of Chernihiv, northeast of Kyiv, have also succeeded in slightly pushing back some of the Russian forces that have surrounded the city for weeks. The official described Ukrainians forces there as continuing to fight ""very hard"" against Russian forces to keep them out of the city and in some cases Russian troops have been ""ceding ground."" ""They are actually moving in the opposite direction, but not by much,"" the official said of Russian forces around the city.

Russian troops now prioritizing operations in eastern Ukraine's Donbass region

The official said Russia appears to be ""starting to prioritize"" their operations in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine, particularly around Luhansk, to cut off Ukraine's military that has been fighting there against Russian separatists for the past eight years. ""We still believe that the Russians are trying to basically cut it off and therefore pin down Ukrainian forces that are that are in the Luhansk, Donetsk area,"" said the official.

""What we're seeing now is indications that the Russians are really starting to prioritize that part of eastern Ukraine,"" said the official. ""We believe that they are now going to start to apply, actually, they have applied a lot more energy in the Luhansk, Donetsk area, particularly around Luhansk. You're seeing them really put more energy and effort into that part of Ukraine.""

The official has previously said that it appears that the Russian forces fighting to take over the southern port city of Mariupol so they can then push north into the Donbass to cut off the Ukrainian military. Meanwhile, the fighting in that city remains ""very very contested"" according to the official who also described the fighting there between Russian and Ukrainian troops as being ""hardcore."" The official noted that Russian forces continue to heavily bombard the city with artillery and long range missile fire.

Meanwhile, it appears that recent Russian military activity around the western port city of Odessa that led to speculation of an attack on the city may have been a feint intended to ""pin down Ukrainian forces."" ""It's not entirely it's not entirely obvious that they actually will make a move on Odessa,"" said the official. ""So we're just we're just kind of watching that to see to see where it goes.""

More US troops going forward to eastern Europe?

The official said that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is always assessing the U.S. military presence in eastern Europe and has not ""taken off the table"" the possibility ""that he will flow more forces in from the United States or reposition from elsewhere in Europe.""

But for now there are no announcements to make said the official who added that it's unclear what the U.S. military posture in eastern Europe will look like going forward. ""Certainly, the security environment in Europe is different now. And it will be different that it will be different no matter what the outcome is of this war,"" said the official.

""I think it's safe to say that the United States as well as other NATO nations will be taken a hard look at what it whether we have the footprint right and whether the posture is appropriate to the new security environment that results from all this,"" the official said.

Russia has lots of missiles left to use

According to the official, Russia has now launched more than 1,200 missiles into Ukraine, but ""we still assess that they have the vast majority of their of their assembled available inventory of surface to air missiles and cruise missiles available to them."" Though the Russian military has expended a lot of the missile inventory readied for operations in Ukraine the official noted that ""they still have an awful lot left.""

The official said that Russia's military is ""running the lowest on our air launched cruise missiles"" but that they still have ""over 50% of what they had assembled prior to the invasion. But they still have a significant number of ground launched cruise missiles, short range ballistic missiles, and medium range ballistic missiles.",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ukraines-military-forces-russian-troops-east-kyiv-back/story?id=83631494

Pope calls for weapons to be 'silenced,' urges support for those fleeing Ukraine Pope Francis called for weapons to be ""silenced"" in Ukraine Sunday, and he urged the international community to support those fleeing the country. ""God is with the peacemakers, not with those who use violence,"" he said during the Sunday Angelus, according to Vatican News, an outlet officially affiliated with the Catholic Church. He also condemned the ""diabolical and perverse logic of weapons."" Francis said those fleeing Ukraine were ""brothers and sisters for whom it is urgent to open humanitarian corridors and who must be welcomed, with an aching heart, for what is happening in Ukraine."" The pontiff also reminded people not to forget about the conflicts unfolding elsewhere in the world, pointing to conflicts in Yemen, Syria and Ethiopia. Share this -







Ukrainian ambassador to U.S. accuses Russia of war crimes Russia has committed war crimes, taken civilians hostage and attacked an orphanage with 50 children inside, Oksana Markarova, the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, said at a press conference Friday. ""The Russian propaganda machine says that civilians were not targeted. I want to tell you that is not true,"" she said, claiming that Russian rockets hit residential areas and ambulances, injured children and destroyed strategic gas pipelines. She said that Ukrainian armed forces are keeping the situation under control, claiming that 2,800 Russians were dead in the conflict and that 80 Russian tanks, 10 planes and seven helicopters had been destroyed. NBC News has not confirmed the numbers of any injuries or deaths on either side. The ambassador also raised concerns about the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, which remains irradiated and a key storage facility for atomic waste after the infamous 1986 meltdown. The Russians seized control and took 92 hostages, she said, forcing them to work in shifts that do not comply with international regulations. ""All responsibility now lies with the Russian army,"" she said regarding the continued maintenance of Chernobyl. Markarova noted that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and President Joe Biden had another call Friday to discuss an anti-war coalition that included 73 countries, ""working hand in hand,"" though she said those countries should also work to further defend Ukraine from Russian attacks. While she applauded the sanctions the U.S. and other countries have announced on Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, she said the sanctions on Russia should go further to fully ""exclude it"" from the international financial system. The press conference concluded with Markarova thanking Russians who had ""protested against Putin's attack on Ukraine."" ""We would like to say, we see you, and it gives us hope that there are forces in Russia that don’t support a brutal attack on this nation,"" she said. Share this -







Russian offensive unexpectedly slowed by stiff Ukrainian resistance Two days in, the Russian offensive appeared to be stymied by stiffer-than-expected resistance from highly motivated Ukrainian armed forces.

A growing number of cultural, sports institutions cut ties with Russia Russia's invasion of Ukraine has pushed several cultural and sports institutions to take a stand. Eurovision banned Russia from its competition, Manchester United severed its sponsorship deal with the Russian airline Aeroflot, and the German soccer club Schalke removed the logo of its main sponsor, the Russian state-owned energy powerhouse Gazprom, from player jerseys. “Given our norms today, [the invasion] is such a gross violation of what we see as our humanity that we’re going to react that way,"" said Matthew Schmidt, a professor of national security and political science at the University of New Haven, who specializes in Russian affairs.

They are fighting for their country,” the official said, adding that the Russians had lost a little bit of momentum and had not advanced as far as they had expected to.

U.S. public sees Russia-Ukraine conflict as a critical threat, Gallup finds Before Russia invaded Ukraine earlier this week, just more than half (52 percent) of Americans viewed the conflict between the two nations as critical to U.S. interests, a Gallup poll released Friday found. That is considerably more than the 44 percent who thought in 2015 that Russia annexing the Crimean Peninsula was critical to U.S. interests. Similar percentages of Republicans (56 percent) and Democrats (61 percent) are likely to see the conflict as a critical threat to U.S. vital interests, the polling taken between Feb. 1 and Feb. 17 found. Russia’s image has also deteriorated further, with 85 percent of Americans viewing the nation unfavorably, an 8 percentage point increase from 2021. Just 15 percent have a positive opinion of it.

Hillary Clinton calls on U.S., European allies to move 'more quickly' on sanctions, targeting Putin and Russian oligarchs Hillary Clinton said in an interview on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" on Friday that she believes the Biden administration and U.S. allies need to impose harsher sanctions on Russia that target President Vladimir Putin himself and his oligarchs. The former secretary of state said she hopes the U.S. and its European allies ""move even more quickly"" to impose sanctions not only on the Russian economy, but also on individual actors ""all the way up to Putin."" ""I think that the only pressure that Putin would respond to, or that could have any kind of impact on his thinking, would be [sanctioning] those who he relies on to launder his money, to keep the funding going into his secret accounts,"" she said. ""We've got to go after those oligarchs who are supporting Putin financially."" Clinton said the U.S. needs to call the oligarchs out by name and go after their assets, such as by a temporary suspension of access to things such as their yachts or huge houses or their bank accounts. ""Because if we don't up the pressure now, whatever we are doing, which I think is absolutely right to bring the world together to bring more troops to protect our NATO allies, it will take longer and Ukraine will be burning,"" she warned. She said there is an ""urgency"" to imposing these more powerful sanctions because some of the attacks haven't gone as well as Russia had wanted in Ukraine. As a result, she said, ""They will get more vicious and they will attack even more randomly and indiscriminately.” Clinton: What's left of the GOP must stand against those giving 'aid and comfort' to Putin Feb. 25, 2022 05:57 Share this -

Russia is ready for talks with Ukraine, Putin tells Xi Russia is ready to conduct high-level negotiations with Ukraine, Putin told Chinese President Xi Jinping in a phone call Friday. According to a summary of the call from China's Foreign Ministry, Putin discussed his view of the historical background of the Ukraine situation, as well as Russia's position on its special military operation in eastern Ukraine. He told Xi that the U.S. and NATO, the U.S.-led military alliance that Ukraine has expressed interest in joining, had ignored Russia's ""legitimate security concerns"" for a long time. They repeatedly reneged on their commitments and instead expanded their military deployment to the east, he said, challenging Russia's ""strategic bottom line."" Xi told Putin that China supports Russia and Ukraine in solving the issue through negotiation, and he repeated China's position that ""Cold War thinking"" should be abandoned and that the legitimate security concerns of all parties should be valued and respected.

Pope Francis visits Russian embassy in Rome to express personal concerns over conflict Pope Francis visited the Russian Embassy in Rome on Friday in an extraordinary gesture to convey his personal concerns about the conflict in Ukraine. The Vatican confirmed to NBC News that the pope had made the visit, which appears to have no recent precedent. Typically, popes receive ambassadors and heads of state in the Vatican, with the Vatican foreign minister expected to summon the ambassador under expected diplomatic protocol. In this case, however, Francis took it upon himself to make the visit in a move appearing to reflect how upset he is at the situation unfolding in Ukraine. Russian Ambassador to the Vatican Alexander Avdeev told Russia's state-run Tass news agency Friday that Francis ""wanted to personally ask about the situation in Donbass and Ukraine."" The pope made the visit after the Vatican had announced that he had canceled a scheduled visit to Florence for Sunday and would not preside over Ash Wednesday commemorations next week due to ""acute"" knee pain. The Vatican said Francis' doctors had prescribed a period of rest, with the pope having long suffered from sciatica nerve pain. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Share this -

Zelenskyy says he missed call with Italy's PM due to deadly fighting: 'Next time I'll try to move the war schedule' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he missed a bilateral call with his Italian counterpart due to deadly fighting in Ukraine.

Russia sanctions are a ‘big deal,’ experts say. But effects could take years. The flurry of sanctions the U.S. announced this week against Russia are some of the hardest-hitting that Moscow has ever faced, but the slow pain they inflict may not be enough to deter President Vladimir Putin from escalating his invasion of Ukraine, experts said. President Joe Biden and several U.S. allies, including the European Union, the United Kingdom and Japan, have vowed to review further restrictions on Moscow as punishment for the invasion. The sanctions already announced are significant in size and scope, former U.S. Treasury and State Department officials who handled American sanctions in the past said, but the longtime American reliance on the national security tool has left the U.S. with few other options if Putin and Russia do not respond. Nevertheless, the Russian economy is already feeling the effects of war, and the sanctions could over time further cause the Russian stock market to falter, deflate the value of the ruble — which hit an all-time low Thursday — and make doing business in Russia increasingly difficult.

Sanctions are focused on preventing 'worst-case scenario,' Price says Sanctions being pushed on Russia as a ""primarily punitive"" measure are part of a larger strategic move against Putin, State Department spokesman Ned Price told MSNBC on Thursday. The sanctions, which were initially imposed Monday but escalated Thursday after Putin's attack on Ukraine, target 80 percent of Russia's banking assets. But they also limit Russia's ability to import about half of the technologies it needs, Price said. ""This is to do everything we can to prevent, to deter, a worst-case scenario,"" Price said. ""We know that what Putin has put in place is the ability to mount a massive, large-scale, bloody, devastating campaign against Ukraine, but also against the Ukrainian people."" Price said the sanctions will build and gain momentum over time. Russia has been hit with sanctions by the U.S. several U.S. allies, including the European Union, the United Kingdom and Japan. The ruble plummeted to an all-time low against the U.S. dollar Thursday as a result, but Russia's central bank promised to support any bank hurt by sanctions, insisting that it has the ability to maintain economic stability.

Moscow may respond to Western sanctions by opting out of the last nuclear arms deal with the U.S., cutting diplomatic ties with Western nations and freezing their assets, a senior Russian official warned Saturday as Russia's ties with the West dived to new lows over its invasion of Ukraine.

The sanctions placed new tight restrictions on Russian financial operations, imposed a draconian ban on technology exports to Russia and froze the assets of Putin and his foreign minister, a harsh response that dwarfed earlier Western restrictions. Washington and its allies say that even tougher sanctions are possible, including kicking Russia out of SWIFT, the dominant system for global financial transactions.

In sarcastic comments posted on a Russian social platform, Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council chaired by Putin, dismissed the sanctions as a show of Western “political impotence” that will only consolidate the Russian leadership and foment anti-Western feelings.

“We are being driven out of everywhere, punished and threatened, but we don't feel scared,” he said, mocking the sanctions imposed by the U.S. and its allies as an attempt to vindicate their past “shameful decisions, like a cowardly retreat from Afghanistan.”

Medvedev was placeholder president from 2008 until 2012 when Putin had to shift into the prime minister’s seat because of term limits. He then let Putin reclaim the presidency and served as his prime minister for eight years.

Medvedev noted that the sanctions offer the Kremlin a pretext to completely review its ties with the West, suggesting that Russia could opt out of the New START nuclear arms control treaty that limits the U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals.

The treaty, which Medvedev signed in 2010 with then-U.S. President Barack Obama, limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers, and envisages sweeping on-site inspections to verify compliance. The pact, the last remaining U.S.-Russian nuclear arms control agreement, had been set to expire in February 2021 but Moscow and Washington extended it for another five years.

If Russia opts out of the agreement now, it will remove any checks on U.S. and Russian nuclear forces and raise new threats to global security.

Medvedev also raised the prospect of cutting diplomatic ties with Western countries, charging that “there is no particular need in maintaining diplomatic relations” and adding that “we may look at each other in binoculars and gunsights.""

Referring to Western threats to freeze the assets of Russian companies and individuals, Medvedev warned that Moscow wouldn't hesitate to do the same.

“We would need to respond in kind by freezing the assets of foreigners and foreign companies in Russia ... and possibly by nationalizing the assets of those who come from unfriendly jurisdictions,” he said. “The most interesting things are only starting now.”",https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/LIVE-russian-strikes-target-kyiv-as-russian-troops-head-for-ukrainian-capital-s-outskirts-1.10634770

Kyiv

Russian forces entered the outskirts of Kyiv on Friday and were threatening the Ukrainian capital from the north-west and east in a lightning attack apparently aimed at seizing the city.

Late on Friday witnesses reported hearing artillery rounds and intense gunfire from the western part of Kyiv, as president Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned his citizens: “This night will be the hardest... We must withstand. The night will be very hard, but sunset will come.”

He added: “We can’t lose the capital.”

The defence ministry in Moscow claimed its forces had taken control of the strategic Hostomel airfield to the north-west after a day of fighting, although Western sources said they did not believe the airport was usable.

A jittery mood also contributed to confusion: what were thought to be a Russian tank were filmed by locals in the Obolonskyi district about six miles north of the city centre in the morning – although one expert said it was probably a Ukranian Strela-10 air defence system.

Nevertheless such was the nervousness, Kyiv authorities earlier warned locals in Obolonskyi to stay off the streets because “active hostilities” were approaching . Residents were urged to “make molotov cocktails”. The defence ministry also said it had distributed 18,000 assault rifles in the capital.

Gunfire could be also heard close to St Sophia Cathedral, reporters said, creating an increasingly tense atmosphere in the capital, which many expected would have been better defended given its obvious strategic significance.

Intense gunfire broke out on a bridge across the Dnieper River dividing eastern and western Kyiv, with about 200 Ukrainian forces taking defensive positions and sheltering behind their armoured vehicles and under the bridge. Another key bridge leading to the capital was blown away, with smoke rising from it.

Konrad Muzyka, the president of Rochan Consulting, said the “situation does look dire at the moment” particularly regarding Kyiv. “It appears that the main goal is to take Kyiv, break the C2 [command and control], and ‘decapitate’ the political leadership.”

Russian forces have been trying to advance through the north-western suburbs around Vorzel, Buch and Irpen. In the early afternoon, Russia claimed it had control of the capital from the west.

During the fighting, Ukrainian officials claimed that a kindergarten in Vorzel where 50 children were sheltering was hit by Russian fire, although without inflicting any casualties.

Ukraine’s military also warned that a group of Russian spies and saboteurs was seen in a district about 3 miles (5km) north of the city centre. Video posted online by an interior ministry adviser apparently showed dead Russian saboteurs who had captured Ukrainian military vehicles and switched uniforms.

Windows were blasted out of a 10-storey apartment block near Kyiv’s main airport, where a 2-metre crater filled with rubble showed where a shell had struck before dawn. A police officer said people were injured there but not killed.

Approach to Kyiv

Pressure was also intensifying around Chernihiv, about 90 miles north-east of Kyiv, Ukraine’s military said. Russian forces are trying to bypass the city, where there had been fighting, and head down the E95 road to Kozelec and ultimately Kyiv’s eastern suburbs.

Farther east, about 125 miles from the capital, Ukraine’s military admitted on Friday morning that the city of Konotop had been lost to Russian forces. Boryspil, the capital’s main civilian airport, lies to the east of the capital.

The speed of the Russian advance, despite the best efforts of Ukraine’s military, caught many by surprise as Russian military forces converged on Kyiv from the north, east and west. But British defence intelligence said it believed the majority of Russian forces aiming for Kyiv were over 50km away.

Mariupol and the Donbas

The US department of defence said that Russia had launched an amphibious landing with thousands of naval infantry to the west of the key southern coastal city of Mariupol.

“It certainly appears to us to be a piece of their designs in the south to further cut off the Donbas region and to – from a southern perspective – continue to try to take population centres,” said John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary.

Kirby said that the US did not have “perfect visibility” on the attack, but video posted on social media earlier appeared to show a column of Russian armoured vehicles, including T-72B3 tanks and BMP-3 armoured vehicles, moving through the coastal town of Prymorsk which is located between Melitopol and Mariupol.

Describing the “amphibious assault” under way from the Sea of Azov a senior US defence official told reporters that Russians are “putting potentially thousands of naval infantry ashore there … The general assumption is they are going to move towards the north-east, towards Mariupol and the Donbas region.”

Several social media accounts in the region showed images and accounts of volleys of Russian Grad missiles hitting targets near Mariupol late on Friday afternoon.

The aim of the landing would appear to be to allow Russian marines to link up with forces farther east in the Donbas region, where Ukraine’s forces were believed to be holding firm.

Video circulated showing large numbers of what appeared to be Russian Spetsnaz special forces massing outside a Ukrainian SBU intelligence building in Melitopol.

Fighting was reported to be continuing around Kherson on the Dnieper River.

Rest of the country

In Sumy, the main city in the eastern Sumy region, 125 miles from the Russian border, Russian forces were in control of the city, with residents saying that armour was visible patrolling in the streets.

South-east of Sumy the city of Kharkiv, which has a population of more than 1 million, is gradually being surrounded. There were reports of artillery fire and shelling in and around the city.

A resident in the southern Black Sea port of Odesa said that while there had been Russian strikes in the south of the city the north remained calm. It appears not to be an early target.

Casualties

Ukraine said that it had killed 1,000 Russian soldiers on Friday alone – and eliminated up to 80 tanks, 7 helicopters and 10 planes. Moscow has given no casualty count. UN officials reported 25 civilian deaths, mostly from shelling and airstrikes, and said that 100,000 people were believed to have left their homes. The death toll or the figures could not be independently verified.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/fight-for-kyiv-russian-forces-ukraine-capital-war
