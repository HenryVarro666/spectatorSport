0,8d969c22-36c7-4091-80da-cc2f18f6f2bd,"['Abc News', 'Matt Seyler', 'April']",,"Thousands of Russian forces near Kyiv and Chernihiv have left to regroup.

The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the U.S. assessment of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist.

Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Wednesday on Day 42:

All Russian troops withdrawn from around Kyiv and Chernihiv

The tens of thousands of Russian troops arrayed against Kyiv and Chernihiv have withdrawn north across the borders of Belarus and Russia to consolidate before likely redeploying to eastern Ukraine, according to the senior defense official.

""We are assessing that they have completely withdrawn from Kiev and from Chernihiv,"" the official said.

But even with the Russian forces, the territory remains treacherous.

""There are some indications that they left behind mines and things like that, so the Ukrainians are being somewhat careful in some areas north of Kyiv as they begin to clear the ground and clear the territory and re-occupy it,"" the official said.

On Monday, the Pentagon estimated that roughly one-third of the Russian forces apparently originally designated to take the capital remained.

Before the withdrawal, there were about 20 Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs) consisting of 800-1,000 troops each in the areas north and northwest of Kyiv, and another 20 BTGs near Chernihiv, according to the official.

While the U.S. hasn't yet seen these troops redeploy elsewhere in Ukraine, it's likely to happen soon, according to the official.

""Our assessment is that they won't want to spend too much time on refit and resupply because they have made a very public show of saying that they're going to prioritize their efforts on the Donbas region,"" the official said.

But the timing will depend on how much work is needed to get the Russian forces back into fighting condition.

""Some of these units have been much more depleted than others, and it's possible that the Russians could combine units to make new BTGs as a result, we just we just don't know,"" the official said.

Of the roughly 130 BTGs Russia dedicated to the invasion, about 80 are still inside Ukraine, according to the official. More than 30 are already in the Donbas region.

US sending 'urgent' shipment of anti-tank missiles for fight in Donbas

Ukrainian forces are preparing for a major fight in the east as Russia prepares as many as 40 BTGs to join 30 more battalions already in Donbas.

""They're not waiting,"" the official said. ""They are already adapting to increased Russian activity in the Donbas region and doing the best they can.""

On Tuesday, the Biden administration authorized a $100 million drawdown package to ""meet an urgent Ukrainian need for additional Javelin anti-armor systems,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement.

The senior U.S. defense official said this move was specifically to help in Donbas.

""One of the reasons why you saw us describe this $100 million drawdown package last night as an urgent need for Javelins was in fact because of the activity in the Donbas and the Ukrainians wanting to make sure that they're ready for increased Russian activity there,"" the official said.

Ukrainians get drone training in US

A small number of Ukrainians currently in the U.S. for ""professional military education"" were pulled aside for a couple days of training on Switchblade drones, which the U.S. is sending overseas as part of its military aid, according to the official.

""Although it's not a very difficult system to operate, we took advantage of having them in the country to give them some rudimentary training on that,"" the official said. ""And there may be some additional rudimentary training while they're here.""

The official said fewer than 12 Ukrainians were given this U.S.-based training.

Pentagon blames Russia for nitric acid explosion

The official said the Pentagon is ""monitoring"" an apparent nitric acid explosion in the Luhansk region, which Russia blamed on Ukraine.

""We've seen the Russians claim that this was a Ukrainian attack on this. We do not believe that is true,"" the official said. ""We do believe that the Russians are responsible, but exactly what they used when they did it, why they did it, what the damage is, we just don't have that level of detail,"" the official said.

'Premeditated' Russian atrocities in Bucha

""When you see individuals with their hands tied behind their backs and evidence of being shot in the head, that certainly appears to be premeditated,"" the official said, again calling for Russian war crimes in Ukraine to be investigated.

Long-range strikes shifting east

Russia has now launched more than 1,450 missiles against Ukraine, according to the official. The Pentagon is seeing more airstrikes targeting the east than Kyiv as Russia shifts its overall focus to the Donbas region.",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russia-fully-withdraws-kyiv-region-ukrainians-drone-training/story?id=83914701

All Russian troops withdrawn from around Kiev and Chernihiv

The tens of thousands of Russian troops lined up against Kiev and Chernihiv have withdrawn northwards across the borders of Belarus and Russia to consolidate before likely redeploying to eastern Ukraine, the senior defense official said.

“We are assessing that they have completely withdrawn from Kiev and Chernihiv,” the official said.

But even with Russian troops, the area remains treacherous.

“There are indications that they left mines and the like, so the Ukrainians are being a bit cautious in some areas north of Kiev as they start clearing the ground and territory and reoccupy it,” the official said.

“Our assessment is that they don’t want to spend too much time restoring and resupplying as they have made a very public show of saying they will prioritize their efforts in the Donbas region,” the official said.

But the timing will depend on how much work is needed to get the Russian forces back into combat condition.

“Some of these units are much more exhausted than others, and it’s possible that the Russians could combine units to make new BTGs as a result, we just don’t know,” the official said.

Of the approximately 130 BTGs that Russia has dedicated to the invasion, about 80 are still in Ukraine, according to the official. There are already more than 30 in the Donbas region.

Ukrainian troops prepare for a major battle in the east, while Russia prepares as many as 40 BTGs to join 30 additional battalions already in Donbas.

2,8d969c22-36c7-4091-80da-cc2f18f6f2bd,[],,"The disastrous week of Russian withdrawal pushes Russian 7-day moving average loss to close to 40 losses a day. While Ukrainian suffer some losses with their counter attacks, they average under 5.

Russian armor loss stands at over 1200, 35% of which are main battle tanks. Tank crews don't grow on trees and Russian inventory are in bad shape. These are irreplaceable losses in the short term.

The Pentagon estimates Russia to still have 80+ of the 130 BTGs(battalion tactical group) they committed to this invasion. That's 31-38% of the units disabled. While they technically still has a ""majority"" of combat power available for the incoming ground swell in Donbas. If the offensive goes as bad as Kyiv, it could very well be the end of Russian military operation in mainland Ukraine.

Defense of Ukraine is not yet complete, but Ukrainians have done a tremendous job so far. They have shown they can win.

3,8d969c22-36c7-4091-80da-cc2f18f6f2bd,[],,"Lets address Military Sizes

At the start of the war Ukraine had about a total of 209,000 active service members, 900k in reserve along with 2000 artillery, 12,000+ armored vehicles, 2,500 tanks, 34 attack helicopters and 98 fighter/attack aircraft.

Russia had 900,000 active soldiers, 2 million in reserves, 7,500 artillery, 30,000 armored vehicles, 12,000 tanks, 500+ attack helicopters and 1,500 fighter/attack aircraft

source

A few things to note on the Russian military sizes

Russia has other interests it needs to keep soldiers dedicated too, those include its big border with NATO countries, its eastern borders, and various Islands, its interior where you do have threats of interior insider uprisings, therefore it is not possible for Russia to dedicate 100% of its military to fighting Ukraine.

Ukraine is able to dedicate 100% of its military resources to fighting Russians. This is key here, Ukraine literally has only one concern, beating Russia. Russia has many concerns.

Not all Russian military service members are war fighters, and not all even suitable for the conflict in Ukraine.

Russian military is suffering from serious corruption issues, I very might doubt their military is as strong on paper as they claim. Source

Ukraine has cleaned up its corruption to a large extent and their numbers on paper are likely very accurate Source

How much of Russia combat capability has Russia dedicated, and what is remaining

Ukraine is largely going be a war of ground combat, there aren't a lot of naval forces that you can bring to bear, Ukraine has proven to be effective at combating Russian air power as we are over a month into this war and Russia does not have air dominance depsite the fact on paper its Air Force should be more capable. Back in February UK intelligence said Russia had dedicated 50% of its combat forces along the borders of Ukraine source

It is also said that Russia had 190,000 soldiers deployed along the Ukrainian Border. So some basic math says if 50% of its ground comabt forces is 190,000 Russia likely has 380,000 total ground combat forces Source

We have already established there is NO WAY Russia can dedicated 100% of its military to the fight so how much more of its combat forces can Russia deploy? 40%? 50%? I would sady 50% of its remaining combat forces is incredibly high, but that means at most Russia can likely send in an additional 90,000 troops. This will also weaken and open Russia to other means of attack on other flanks

Losses

Out of 190,000 soldiers per Ukraine numbers they suggest 76,600 have been taken out of action (18.9k dead, 56.7k wounded, 1k POW) [Source}(https://www.minusrus.com/en) it is also estimated from the same sound they've lost 65% of the armored combat vehicles they've sent to the fight, 60% of its ranks, 20% of its artillery, 45% of its aircraft, 55% of its helicopters, and 9% of its navy that Russia has dedicated to the fight. Even if you take this number and cut it in half Russia has still lost 20% of its combat effective force in just 6 weeks. I would estimate Russia has been 115k-150k of its remaining forces left over.

Russia claims 14k Ukrainian soldiers killed and 16k wounded Source At the time of the publication this was two weeks ago I don't think the number was that high then, but I imagine its closer by now as both countries are taking daily losses. So lets assume only 5k of the wounded are able to return to battle that means Ukraine has lost 25k of its combat force.

As for tanks/vehicles/etc well Ukraine has indeed had combat losses, it has captured far more then its lost. Therefore Ukrainian armored forces are likely at the same levels if not slightly higher levels then before the war. Source So well I don't think the number of vehicles Ukraine has captured is a significant bolster to its combat capabilities the fact that they are even is a huge win.

Also modern military equipment, like all equipment requires advanced technology to operate such as computer chips, which Russia has been cut off from. Therefore Russia does not have the ability currently to replenish its vehicles its lost in any meaningful manner. Source

Ukraine Mobilization & Logistics

There is a famous quote from a famous American General Omar Bradley ""Amateur's talk strategy. Professionals talk logistics"". Well Ukraine economy is not nearly the size of Russia, and Russia outspends them by a ton (how much of that is actually effective is guess work) Ukraine essentially has a blank check from the west to fight this war. I could source it, but we've seen the news the west has supplied billions upon billions of aid to include military equipment to Ukraine. Russia does not have this luxury.

Further more Ukrainian foreign legion of 20,000 soldiers is nearly enough to already replace all of its combat losses, well how many of those are in combat as of right now, we do not know. However its very likely in the many thousands. Source

In the early days of the war Ukraine called up 200,000 of its reserved Source in addition Ukraine has called for mass mobilization of all its citizens to the war Source Ukraine along with its western partners are training Ukrainian forces, well its hard to get exact sources on this it is logical that Ukraine currently has hundreds of thousands of additional soldiers currently going through training with the intent to deploy them to the war effort as you read this Source

Conclusion

With all this being said, figuring 1/3 of the Foreign Legion is combat effective, its reserves are combat ready, and what remains of the Ukrainian military I would estimate the Ukrainian military to have about 454,000 soldiers armed, and ready to fight today. As time goes on this number will increase depsite combat losses. Russia has somewhere between 114k-150k soldiers in the region currently and maybe up to 90k they might be able to quickly dedicate to the fight for a total of 200k-240k.

It is significtally harder to attack then defend, I do not think with the help of the west that Ukraine lacks the technology needed to be combat effective. In addition it is obvious the moral among Ukrainian forces is very high, and Russian forces are is very low.

So in conclusion I would say of writing this right now, Ukrainian military is better trained, better equipped, and in larger numbers then the forces Russia can dedicate to the invasion. I suspect the top brass among the Russian military have come to the conclusion that there is no way they will win the way they'd like to and are likely to make a strong push in the east, try to take over some natural gas pipelines and secure water resources for Crimeria and make Ukraine a land locked country.

I do not think they will be successful. As each day goes by the Ukrainian Army gets bigger, and stronger and the Russian forces become smaller and weaker. The sanctions are limiting Russias ability to function as well.

Also I'm confident Ukraine will be able to move and consolidate some of its forces that are currently north of Kyiv, in Kyiv, and move them to the east. So even though Russia will be heavily reinforcing that region, Ukraine will be able to also match or exceed that reinforcement.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/tyvtty/ukraine_likely_now_has_a_larger_military_force/

Висловити свою підтримку та будь-яким чином допомогти українцям намагається не лише місцева влада але й пересічні американці.

""Усе починається з прапора чи твору мистецтва. А потім ти бачиш, що все більше і більше людей щось роблять.""

Художник Дон Ріпер, із міста Александрія, що в штаті Вірджинія, не мав українського прапору. Тому він вирішив намалювати його власноруч і вивісити на вітрину своєї творчої студії.

""Спочатку я наніс фарбу ножем, хотів, щоб зображення було грубим. Але це виглядало занадто механічно. Тоді я подумав: те що відбувається має фізичний вимір – руйнуються будинки, руйнуються життя, люди переселяються. І в цьому немає нічого чистого, - тут, потрібно забруднити руки"", - розповідає художник Голосу Америки Дон.

За словами митця, російська війна шокує, але водночас бойовий дух українців надихає. Відтак, залишитись осторонь неможливо, каже він: ""Усе починається з прапора чи твору мистецтва. А потім ти бачиш, що все більше і більше людей щось роблять. Минулої п'ятниці у нашому місті відбувся збір коштів за участі великої кількості ресторанів. Потім вони організували чудовий захід, на якому зібрали понад 35 000 доларів для благодійної організації «CORE», яка займається гуманітарною допомогою"".

""Так, ми організували збір коштів - ""ніч для України"". Ми хотіли зібрати 10 000 доларів для фонду ""CORE"". Усі гроші йдуть безпосередньо українським переселенцям...Вже зібрано понад 35 000 доларів"".

""CORE"" (Community Organized Relief Effort) , також відома як ""CORE Response"" є неприбутковою організацією, яка була заснованою актором Шоном Пенном у відповідь на землетрус на Гаїті 2010-го року. Володар двох премій Оскар, актор та режисер знімав документальний фільм ""Vice"" про Україну, коли РФ почала повномасштабне вторгнення. Відтак, сьогодні його благодійна організація збирає допомогу українцям, які були вимушені покинути свої домівки через російську війну. Збір коштів для ""CORE"" до якого долучився художник Дон Ріпер, був також організований пересічними американцями, представниками місцевої громади міста Александрія.

""Так, ми організували збір коштів ""Вечір для України"". Ми хотіли зібрати 10 000 доларів для фонду ""CORE"". Усі гроші йдуть безпосередньо українським переселенцям…щоб долучитись потрібно було придбати квиток за 25 доларів. Людей також заохочували робити пожертви. А якщо хтось не зміг прийти особисто, то можна було пожертвувати онлайн. Вже зібрано понад 35 000 доларів"", - ділиться із Голосом Америки Коллін Мелоні, представниця місцевої громади ""ALX Community"", яка ініціювала збір.

Мережа тематичних ресторанів ""Home Run Restaurant Group"", яку представляє Білл Блекберн, нараховує 6 закладів. Вони вирішили продавати розливне пиво по 10 доларів на підтримку України. Усі гроші йдуть у фонд ""World Central Kitchen"", відомого іспано-американського шеф-кухаря, Хосе Андреса . Останній оголосив про збір коштів для українців майже від початку повномасштабної російської війни.

""Нехай люди України на вулицях та у підвалах, де вони ховаються в зоні бойових дій, знають, що ми тут, у Сполучених Штатах, будемо підтримувати їх до кінця"".

""Ми вирішили співпрацювати із ""World Central Kitchen"", з Хосе Андресом. У нас виникла ідея вибрати окреме розливне пиво у кожному з наших ресторанів і продавати його за 10 доларів. Усі 10 доларів від проданого пива підуть на ""World Central Kitchen"". Це стало нашим механізмом поширення інформації та збору коштів. Але ми не маємо прямого зв’язку з Україною. У нас немає навіть співробітників чиї сім’ї перебували би там"", - розповідає Білл Блекберн, партнер в ""Home Run Restaurant Group"".

Загалом американці наголошують - серед пересічних громадян США існує велике бажання допомогти Україні, однак знайти перевірений фонд складно.

""Я хотів би, щоб був якийсь централізований список, який би усі знали. До прикладу, ці пожертви йдуть безпосередньо на цю справу, а не загубляться серед загального збору коштів. Я думаю, це було б дуже корисним, якби існував такий перелік"", - розповідає Художник Дон Ріпер.

""Дуже важливо перевіряти, щоб переконатися, що гроші, які ви жертвуєте, підуть доброчесним організаціям"", - додає Коллін Мелоні, представниця місцевої громади ""ALX Community"".

Є й такі американці, які висловлюють свою громадську позицію на вулицях міст. Джону О’Доннелу, 68-м років, він незрячий. Він не має ані українського походження, ані іншого зв'язку з Україною, однак, протягом кількох останніх днів приходить до російського посольства у Вашингтоні для одиночного пікету.

""Я вже неодноразово приходив до російського посольства, щоб повідомити уряду Росії, що всі порядні люди в усьому світі виступають проти незаконного та аморального вторгнення на територію суверенної держави Україна та проти вбивства її народу. Нехай люди України на вулицях та у підвалах, де вони ховаються в зоні бойових дій, знають, що ми тут, у Сполучених Штатах, будемо підтримувати їх до кінця"", - розповідає Голосу Америки О'Доннелл.

Покидаючи місце свого протесту, пан О’Доннел вигукнув у сторону російського посольства: ""Я ще повернусь!""

Нагадаємо, що раніше посолка США з питань кримінального правосуддя в світі Бет Ван Шек розповіла, що США допомагають українській владі документувати свідчення військових злочинів, які, за звинуваченнями, російські сили скоїли в Україні.

Moscow’s Privatized Point-Men in Central Africa Have Had It Their Way So Far. Can It Last?

Dr. Andrew McGregor

AIS Special Report, February 5, 2022

Moscow’s addition of Russian “contract soldiers” to its fighting force in Chechnya has evolved into the regular use of contract fighters to spread Russian political and economic interests in conflict zones, especially those experiencing seemingly intractable conflicts. Unlike those who served in Chechnya, the new generation of contract fighters operate outside Russia’s formal military structure. Like earlier European mercenary groups in Africa, it is understood by the leaders of these “contractors” that their reward for saving governments under threat will be guaranteed access to the wealth generated from resource extraction.

Central African Republic (Worldometer)

The use of mercenaries as bodyguards for the president has a long history in the CAR, with Chadian gunmen usually filling this role, so the introduction of Russian mercenaries as presidential security was hardly unprecedented. What is surprising is the eagerness with which African nations such as the Central African Republic (CAR), Sudan, Mozambique, Mali and others have welcomed the return of White European mercenaries after decades spent trying to drive them out of Africa. The surprise is even greater when it is plain the mercenaries from the east are still using the playbook used by the White mercenaries of the 1960s and later:

Separate the ruler from the ruled by forming a bodyguard of mercenaries who control access to the leader;

Insert economic “advisors” who direct national finances;

Ensure rights to mining and other extractive industries are given to firms favored or owned by the mercenaries;

Establish discreet and deniable connections to European states or corporate interests seeking to establish or expand their influence and holdings in Africa.

The leaders of Wagner Group appear to be familiar with the work of earlier European mercenaries in Africa, including Frenchman Bob Denard, a mercenary who worked for Belgian mineral interests in Katanga in the 1960s. Denard later became the power behind the throne in the Comoros Islands by controlling its 500-man presidential bodyguard through the 1980s, maintaining connections to Jacques Foccart, France’s point-man in Africa before deciding to take over the country himself in 1995.

Bob Denard in Katanga

The Russians are also sure to have studied the disastrous South African deployment in Bangui in 2013 and the book Composite Warfare: The Conduct of Successful Ground Force Operations in Africa, an influential 2016 tactical work by South African mercenary Colonel Eeben Barlow, based partly on operations carried out against Boko Haram in Nigeria by his mixed-race “Specialized Tasks, Training, Equipment and Protection” unit (STTEP). [1]

Civil War in the CAR

Both Ali Darassa and Mahamat al-Khatim were officially dismissed as special military advisors on December 31, 2020 (RFI, January 2, 2021). Al-Khatim’s Mouvement patriotique pour la Centrafrique (MPC) suffered serious losses in arms and personnel during the late 2021 government counter-offensive. A recent communiqué from the MPC chief-of staff, “General” Abdraman Mahamat Abfiessa, accused the government of President Faustin-Archange Touadéra, a Christian, of “using a Hitlerian strategy to erase the Muslim identity of the Central African Republic” (Corbeau News [Bangui], January 7, 2022).

Sidiki Abass (DW.com)

Sidiki Abass, whose Retour, Récupération, Réhabilitation (3R) militia was notorious for torture, rape and murder, quickly returned to the bush after the 2019 Khartoum Accord that was meant to end the fighting. He died in March 2021 from wounds either received in an attack on a village on November 16, 2020 or in an ambush of his convoy in December 2020. Sidiki was succeeded by the self-described “General Bobbo.” The 3R’s hold on diamond-rich areas and control of the cross-border cattle trade with Cameroon have enabled it to buy arms and recruit mercenaries of their own (Vanguard [Lagos], December 6, 2021). Many of these mercenaries come from Chad, some with combat experience on Libyan battlefields. There is no difficulty for them in crossing the permeable border between Chad and the CAR.

Mahamat al-Khatim

3R is mostly Fulani, as is the UPC, and began its run in 2015 as a Fulani self-defense militia. Al-Khatim’s MPC is a mix of Arab and Fulani fighters. The conflict in the northern CAR reflects the growing militancy of the Fulani people across Africa’s Sahel belt, though their struggles remain uncoordinated, lack central direction and are generally fuelled by local issues and ethnic rivalries rather than ideology. Baba Laddé is one of the few to have tried to situate the violence between Fulani groups and their neighbors within a larger ethnic framework, with some attempt to define larger goals for a multinational Fulani alliance.

Fulani herders in the CAR are actually targeted by both certain rebel groups and government forces (and their allies), whether through taxation in the form of cattle or retaliatory attacks in response to operations by self-identified Fulani “self-defense” groups. In dealing with the Fulani, the Russians are reported to make little distinction between civilian herders and armed fighters (Le Monde/AFP, January 14, 2022).

The ongoing violence in the CAR began when its president, François Bozizé Yangouvonda (Gbaya ethnicity), was deposed in March 2013. Bozizé had seized power in a 2003 coup but was expelled by the Muslim Séléka alliance of Arab and Fulani rebel groups in 2013. Bozizé fled Bangui for Cameroon in March 2013 as Russian-educated Séléka leader Michel Djotodia took power as the CAR’s first Muslim president. Bangui and other parts of the CAR were plunged into violence as hastily-formed “anti-Balaka” Christian militias began retaliatory attacks on Séléka fighters and Muslim civilians for attacks on CAR Christians.

Djotodia, a member of the Gula ethnic group from Vakanga prefecture, was forced to resign in January 2014 and an interim government was formed as UN, African Union and French troops attempted to restore stability and security. In March 2016, academic and former prime-minister Faustin-Archange Touadéra was elected CAR president. Following the election, French troops withdrew, creating immediate security challenges for the new president.

Bozizé attempted a return to the CAR in late 2019 with the intention of running in the December 2020 presidential elections, but the CAR’s constitutional court announced his disqualification on moral grounds due to outstanding international warrants and UN sanctions for torture and war crimes. Instead, Bozizé was alleged to have mounted a failed coup attempt in December 2020, a week before elections were to begin. The action prompted Russian and Rwandan reinforcements.

Six of the strongest rebel groups mounted a joint offensive against the Touadera government in December 2020, calling themselves the Coalition des Patriotes pour le Changement (CPC). Their plan to cut off the capital was foiled by the response of CAR troops, Rwandan special forces and Russian mercenaries. By January 13, the rebels began to retreat. Ten days later, the government reported the death of 44 rebels at Boyali (54 miles from Bangui), “including several mercenaries from Chad, Sudan and the Fulani.” (Al-Jazeera, January 25, 2021).

In late February 2021, the Bozizé stronghold of Bossangoa 175 miles north of Bangui was captured by CAR troops supported by Russians and Rwandans. Bozizé, who was being investigated for “rebellion” at the time, took charge of the CPC in March 2021. He is now believed to reside in N’Djamena; in his absence, Ali Darassa has taken control of the rebel coalition.

The CAR government declared a unilateral ceasefire in October, 2021 to encourage a dialogue with rebel factions. The move, however, had little impact on the ongoing violence; the rebels had little interest and the government offensive continued. 3R forces attacked the town of Mann in the northwest, killing five civilians and one soldier in December 2021, while a particularly gruesome machete attack by pro-Touadéra militias in the CAR’s center-east left 15 civilians dead including women and children; many others suffered mutilations and amputation of limbs (AFP, December 20, 2021; ).

Increasing the instability in Bangui is the revival of the Requin (“sharks”), a pro-ruling party militia known for its violence. Created in 2019 by Touadéra’s Mouvement cœurs unis (MCU – United Hearts Movement), the Requin were dissolved in July 2020 under international pressure. Resurrected in 2021, the group mounts heavily-armed patrols through Bangui at night (Jeune Afrique, January 12, 2021). They have been accused of mounting an assassination campaign against members of the Gbaya (François Bozizé’s ethnic group) and circulating lists of opposition figures to be eliminated (Corbeaunews [Bangui], January 18, 2021). Russian mercenaries are also reported to have targeted the Gbaya with summary executions (ICG, December 3, 2021).

Clashes on the Chad/CAR Border

Unsurprisingly, tensions between a pro-French government in Chad and a pro-Russian government in Chad’s traditional Central African hinterland have created a state of instability along the border between the two nations. At times, these clashes have threatened to spark a wider conflict.

An attack by Russian fighters and CAR regulars on a Chadian border post on May 30, 2021 resulted in the death of six Chadians and three Russians. Chad’s defense ministry claimed that five of their soldiers had been captured and executed. Bangui insisted the clash was “a mistake” resulting from CAR forces and their allies pursuing rebels near the border (Reuters, June 2, 2021). A diplomatic crisis followed and more Chadian troops and weapons were sent to the border. The incident came only weeks after the Russian ambassador to the CAR criticized Chad for failing to prevent the passage of arms and fighters across the border into the CAR (Africa Report, June 4, 2021). Asked why Chad did not respond militarily to the execution of its troops, Mahamat Idriss would only respond: “Let’s just say that we exercised a lot of restraint after these murders were committed” (Africa Report, June 30, 2021).

Sani Yalo (DR)

Following the incident, the CAR’s top “fixer,” Sani Yalo, was sent to N’Djamena to assure Chad’s leadership that President Touadéra had no interest in creating insecurity on the border. Yalo is a political operator and one of President Touadéra’s closest advisors, despite having no official position. Believed to be pro-Russian, Yalo has demonstrated his survival skills and importance by acting as a presidential advisor during the presidencies of Ange-Félix Patassé, François Bozizé and Michel Djotodia. Touadéra refuses to extradite Yalo to Equatorial Guinea, where he is wanted for his alleged involvement in a 2017 attempt to overthrow President Teodoro Obiang Nguema (Jeune Afrique, October 16, 2019).

A further confrontation followed on December 10, 2021, when Russian mercenaries pursuing CPC rebels crossed the border into Chad. After a firefight with Chadian troops in which one Chadian was killed, the Russians withdrew, taking one captured soldier with them (Corbeau News, December 12, 2021).

Instability on the CAR’s South-Western Border with Cameroon

The regions adjacent to the 560-mile-long border between Cameroon and the CAR are beset by cattle-rustling, banditry, kidnappings and arms trafficking. When pressed, rebel groups from either nation take refuge on the other side of the border and have become heavily involved in resource exploitation, including the hunt for gold. Life in the border region has become precarious; 3R rebels launched attacks on CAR civilians and security forces near the Cameroon border on November 28, 2021, killing 30 civilians and two soldiers.

It is not only Fulani herders who are now in conflict with agricultural communities. In northern Cameroon, there have been repeated and bloody clashes between Arab Shuwa herders and Musgum (a.k.a. Mulwi) and Masa (a.k.a. Masana, Yagoua) farmers and fishermen over access to diminishing water resources. With the influx of arms to the Sahel region in recent decades, massacres have replaced traditional modes of dispute resolution; as one traditional chief in north Cameroon noted: “Today, when there is a problem between two people from different communities, all the communities get involved with weapons” (Reuters, December 9, 2021). Many Cameroonians have fled the violence into the CAR, while some 300,000 CAR residents have fled the other way into Cameroon.

The Russian Third Phase in Africa

Tsarist efforts to establish a colonial foothold in the Horn of Africa after the collapse of the Egyptian Empire in the late 19th century came to naught. This was despite the notable efforts of a handful of adventurous Russian officers and Cossacks who became influential in the court of the Abyssinian emperor and even managed to plant a Russian flag at Fashoda on the White Nile before the arrival of the French or British. However, there was little interest in Africa at St. Petersburg, as Russia focused on consolidating its rule in the Caucasus and Central Asia.

Soviet efforts in the post-colonial era were more determined and resource-targeted, but decades of military and diplomatic work had unsatisfactory results – the Russians were expelled from Egypt due to Cold War political manoeuvring and the application of Marxist economics by inexperienced Soviet-trained leaders to non-industrial societies in sub-Saharan Africa resulted in famine, economic collapse and intractable civil wars. These latter, naturally, were fuelled by Western states desiring to make the communist presence in Africa as costly as possible. These strategies transformed Africa into a proxy battleground until the collapse of the Soviet Union ended the Soviet project in Africa.

Ten Russian BDRM-2 armored scout cars were delivered to FACA in 2020; two broke down almost immediately.

The third phase of Russian interest in Africa may be inspired by Soviet-era efforts (especially its search for African military bases), but has abandoned the ideological element of the Soviets. This eases the entry of Russian business interests and resource extractors that are often closely tied to the provision of some combination of military contractors, arms supplies, personal security, political advisors and information manipulators. These, in turn, have direct connections to Kremlin insiders like Yevgeny Prigozhin (owner of the Wagner Group) who can get things done even without having official status in the Russian government. For unstable regimes with no other means of re-asserting government control in profitable but rebellious regions, it is an attractive model.

The Wagner Group and Russian arms arrived in January 2018, not long after a visit by President Touadéra to Sochi, where he met with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. Four years later, Russians have become a highly influential, if not dominant, force in the national army, the gendarmerie, the mineral sector, the presidency and the National Assembly. The Wagner force is mainly Russian, but is reported to include a number of Syrians and Libyans whose knowledge of Arabic is useful in dealing with the CAR’s Muslim communities.

A report leaked from the EU’s foreign service in November 2021 described Russia’s use of a “complex hybrid strategy” in the CAR, including “support through proxies in the National Assembly.” The report also noted the Wagner Group’s “alleged reliance” on official Russian military infrastructure, transport and health services (EU Observer, November 29, 2021). Two weeks later, the EU imposed sanctions on the Wagner Group and eight specific individuals associated with it, citing “serious human rights abuses, including torture, extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and killings [and] destabilising activities in some of the countries they operate in,” including Libya, Syria, Ukraine and the CAR.

In March 2021, the UN Working Group on the Use of Mercenaries cited various abuses by Russian mercenaries in the CAR, including mass summary executions, torture, arbitrary detentions, indiscriminate targeting of civilians and attacks on humanitarian workers. The UN investigators were also alarmed by the “proximity and interoperability” between the mercenaries and the peacekeepers of the UN’s Mission multidimensionnelle intégrée des Nations unies pour la stabilisation en Centrafrique (MINUSCA) forces (Al-Jazeera, March 31, 2021). In response to the UN’s claim Russian fighters had looted and murdered in the CAR, Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov insisted such reports were “yet another lie” (AP, June 28, 2021). Anti-MINUSCA protests in Bangui organized by Touadéra’s Russian advisors quickly followed the release of the UN report. Since the protests, Russian diplomatic efforts have prevented UN experts from pursuing further investigations.

However, the relationship between MINUSCA and the Russians inevitably deteriorated as the year progressed due to the conflict between their mandates and the difference in their methods. Whatever cooperation existed between the two groups was finally put to rest on November 1, 2021, when ten unarmed Egyptian policemen joining the MINUSCA force were wounded at Bangui’s M’Poko Airport in an attack by the Russian-controlled Presidential Guard. MINUSCA described the attack as “deliberate and unjustifiable,” though a presidential spokesman claimed the reports had “nothing to do with reality” (Reuters, November 3, 2021; UN News, November 2, 2021). [2]

In recent weeks, Russian mercenaries in Bria, capital of the Haute Kotto prefecture, have been in the habit of rounding up young men on a daily basis for use as forced labor in the construction of a nearby base. When no young men were to be found for several days, the Russians carried out a military operation in the early morning, surrounding Bria and opening fire on fleeing youth. Four were killed, prompting the rest of the town to flee to the bush or to the safety of a nearby displaced persons’ camp. The Russians returned late in the day to carry away the bodies of the deceased from a mosque where they were awaiting burial (Journal de Bangui, January 5, 2020; HumAngle [Abuja], January 5, 2022).

Claims of abuses by Russians in the CAR have been dismissed by a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman: “If the insinuations about their atrocities had any real foundation, and the local population was actively protesting, the CAR’s leadership would hardly have insisted on the further presence of specialists from Russia” (Financial Times, October 25, 2021).

The Russian fighters are steady consumers of imported vodka and land for a local vodka distillery in the CAR has already been expropriated. When vodka runs short, the mercenaries are known to add isopropyl alcohol, Mecurochrome and various chemical-based wound disinfectants to beer to give it the necessary kick. Three Russians died from drinking these concoctions in mid-2021; four more died and six others were hospitalized in the last week of January 2022. Troops of the Force Armée Centrafricaine (FACA – Armed Forces of Central Africa) are said to avoid drinking with their Russian comrades (Corbeaunews [Bangui], January 31, 2022).

Valery Zakharov is the CAR’s national security advisor, assuming both military and diplomatic roles, including negotiations with Mahamat Darassa and other rebel leaders. The former intelligence agent, variously described as a veteran of the FSB or the GRU, also has a business role through mining firm Lobaye Invest Sarlu and Séwa Sécurité (or Sewa Security Services – SSS), a Russian private military contractor (PMC) engaged to guard President Touadera and other CAR officials. [3] According to Zakharov, Russia is not presently seeking a military base in the CAR, but did not rule it out in the future: “There is already a Russian military representation in the CAR, which is still sufficient for operational coordination between the Central African and Russian Ministries of Defense, the issue of opening the base is not yet on the agenda” (Descifrando la Guerra, March 7, 2021). While a military base may become a reality in the future, for now instability in the CAR has created an entry point for Russian interests in the CAR’s valuable mining sector.

Russian Members of Sewa Security Services in the CAR (Jeune Afrique)

In a September 2021 interview, a defensive President Touadéra pretended to have little knowledge of Wagner, Sewa Security or Lobaye Invest, adding that an appeal for security assistance from EU states had failed to obtain a favorable response. However, Russia, “with whom we have a long-standing relationship,” responded positively with arms and military trainers: “I have nothing to hide about the Russians” (Africa Report, September 24, 2021).

Prigozhin is reported to control both M-Finans, specializing in precious metals and the provision of private security services, and Lobaye Invest Sarlu, specializing in the mining of non-ferrous metal ores. Mining permits are regularly issued without consultation of the CAR’s National Assembly, a violation of the national constitution (Jeune Afrique, August 20, 2019). According to the US Treasury Department, Prigozhin’s CAR operations are “reported to be coordinated with the Russian Federation’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defense.” [4]

Yevgeny Khodotov is the managing director of Lobaye Invest Sarlu, with contracts to explore for gold and diamonds, sometimes through another company called M-Finance. The US Treasury Department has identified Khodotov as an associate of Prigozhin. He is reported to be in contact with Noureddine Adam, leader of a faction of the Runga-dominated Front Populaire pour la renaissance de la Centrafrique (FPRC), as well as former president Michel Djotodia (Jeune Afrique, August 20, 2019). [5] The FPRC, under its military commander Abdoulaye Hissène, is known for targeting Fulanis; in 2016 the group massacred 85 people in Bria during a brutal raid on the town that displaced 11,000 people (Reuters, November 26, 2016). The FPRC was targeted by government-controlled militias in 2019-20. Noureddine Adam is now believed to be living in Sudan after the CAR government’s counter-offensive.

UPC Rebels, 2018 (Radio Ndeke Luka)

Reports of a massacre of civilians carried out in January near Bria (Haute-Kotto prefecture) by FACA and Russian mercenaries have ignited a UN investigation by MINUSCA officials. The incident occurred during a January 16-17 operation against Darassa’s UPC. Dozens of civilians were reported killed; a military source described “summary executions” and “more than 50 deaths” (AFP, January 21, 2022, al-Jazeera, January 22, 2022).

Nonetheless, Touadéra’s Russian advisors have tried to popularize the unfamiliar Russian presence in the CAR, providing medical services and sports equipment, funding a “Miss Centrafrique” contest and producing a film lionizing the Russian fighters. “The Tourist,” a Prigozhin-financed movie about young Russian military advisors in the CAR battling bloodthirsty rebels, was shown at a Bangui sports stadium to as many as 70,000 people, some of whom were helpfully supplied with Russian flags to show their enthusiasm. Dubbed into the local Sangho language (a lingua franca in the CAR), the movie featured Wagner Group mercenaries as extras. A “quickie” by film standards, the movie was shot in March-April 2021 and premiered in May (Moscow Times, May 21, 2021).

FACA Troops Wearing “Russie – Je Suis Wagner” T-shirts (Corbeaunews)

Displaying little regard for the political sensitivities of the CAR rulers who were trying to disavow any knowledge of Wagner Group mercenaries in the country, the Russian mercenaries created a “Je Suis Wagner” (I am Wagner) t-shirt they issued to the gendarmerie and FACA members (some of these bear a large “Russie” logo over the shirt’s image). Soon, the shirts were being worn by fashionable youth and members of the ruling party alike (Corbeaunews [Bangui], October 31, 2021).

The services of private Russian security firms don’t come cheap, and questions have been asked regarding the possibility that donations from the World Bank and the EU, which provide half of the CAR’s $400 million budget, might be used to pay the Russian mercenaries on top of access to gold and diamond deposits (Financial Times, October 25, 2021).

The French Reaction

Unhappy with the Russian challenge to France’s traditional zone of influence, French president Emmanuel Macron has used strong language to condemn the growing criticisms of France in the CAR: “This anti-French rhetoric legitimises the presence of predatory Russian mercenaries at the highest levels of the state, with President Touadéra who is today a hostage of the Wagner group. This group is taking over the mines and, in the same way, the political system” (Journal du Dimanche, May 29, 2021; RFI, May 31, 2021).

France is still far from out of the picture in the CAR, and some indication of its lingering influence might be seen in the June 10, 2021 resignation of Prime Minister Firmin Ngrebada and his cabinet. Ngrebada was an architect of the 2019 Khartoum Accord and believed to be close to the Russians, at whose embassy he sought refuge when the Séléka movement occupied Bangui in 2013. Five days after his resignation, he was replaced by former finance minister Henri Marie Dondra, believed to be closer to the French who lobbied hard for Ngrebada’s removal. Dondra, whose family lives in France, declined the protection of Russian bodyguards (Jeune Afrique, June 18, 2021). Despite Dondra’s acceptability to the IMF/World Bank, there has been internal pressure to replace him. Dondra is reported to have already submitted his resignation earlier this month; the president is expected to respond in the coming days. The prime minister has struggled with demands from the Wagner Group, a staff picked by a president to whom he has never been close, increased reluctance to provide continuing financial support to the CAR by France and the EU, and finally ethnic insults made by the spokesman of the leader of the National Assembly (African Intelligence, February 4, 2022). Though the World Bank is unhappy about the Russian mission’s influence on certain government institutions, Dondra’s successor is likely to be more accommodating to the Russian presence in the CAR.

The Investigation

To the surprise of many, on October 1, 2021 CAR Minister of Justice Arnaud Djoubaye Abazène (a relative of Michel Djotodia) released the results of an investigation by a Special Commission of Inquiry into human rights violations in the CAR that implicated the CPC rebels, MINUSCA troops and “Russian instructors who operate in support of FACA” in repeated and egregious violations (Le Monde/AFP, October 1, 2021). Aware of the repercussions the report would have, Djoubaye did not provide advance notice to the Russian military mission or the Russian embassy. After presenting the report, the Minister of Justice was roundly assailed as “pro-French” by deputies in the Touadera camp.

Only two weeks after Djoubaye made the accusations of war crimes and human rights violations public, the CAR’s National Assembly issued a public letter of thanks for the “interventions of the Russian contingent alongside our forces” in retaking the regions occupied by “terrorists,” along with “our sincere congratulations for your bravery” (Afrik.com, October 16, 2021). The letter, completely undermining the Minister of Justice, was yet another example of the growing Russian influence in the Assembly.

Djoubaye was forced to defend his report in a parliamentary interpellation several days later, though he opened by criticizing the “almost generalized impunity” enjoyed by military, political and criminal human rights violators in the CAR. Repeating that the majority of such violations were committed by rebel movements, Djoubaye noted the “privilege of jurisdiction” enjoyed by FACA’s foreign allies, an acknowledgement that crimes committed by these entities were unlikely to be prosecuted in the CAR. Attempting to still the waters, the Justice Minister finished by stating that the report of the Special Commission of Inquiry “was not intended to affect the morale of FACA or that of the allies who are applauded by our people” (Centrafrique-presse, October 24, 2021).

Djoubaye and the Tribal War in the North

Djoubaye has himself been accused of helping orchestrate attacks amounting to war crimes in his hometown of Birao (capital of Vakaga prefecture) in 2019. The attacks were carried out by pro-government militias on members of the Runga community, especially those close to the FPRC (Monde Afrique, July 3, 2021). Dozens were killed and tens of thousands displaced in the violence between neighboring ethnic groups.

The three militias involved in the attacks on the Runga included:

The Mouvement des libérateurs centrafricains pour la justice (MLCJ), composed largely of Kara and Gula from the region of Birao. The MLCJ was founded by Abakar Sabone and is now led by Gilbert Toumou Deya, currently a cabinet minister under the integration terms of the Khartoum Accord. The political/military movement is reported to have been reinforced by Chadian and Sudanese mercenaries (Mondafrique, March 28, 2020).

The Rassemblement patriotique pour le renouveau de la Centrafrique (RPRC). The movement’s founder and political leader, Herbert Gontran Djono Ahaba, is now a cabinet minister. The RPRC, operating in the northeast CAR, is now led in the field by Gula “General” Zakaria Damane (a.k.a. Moustapha Maloum). Damane cooperates with Lobaye Invest in the Ouadda region of Haute-Kotto prefecture.

The Parti pour le rassemblement de la nation centrafricaine (PRNC) is led by Nour Gregaza (a.k.a. Mahamat Nour Nizan) and Issa Issaka Aubin, former army chief-of-staff under the presidency of Michel Djotodia (Mondafrique, March 28, 2020; RFI, June 6, 2019). The movement was created by a June 2019 split with the RPRC.

The clashes in Birao led to a vicious split in the ranks of the FPRC in neighboring Haute-Kotto prefecture. Diamonds appeared to be at the core of a further clash in Bria in January 2020, between the Kara and Gula peoples who own the mines and their former Runga allies in the FPRC who control the sale and trade of diamonds from the region (AFP, January 20, 2020). The fighting was joined by fighters of the Kara and Gula-dominated MLCJ. The FPRC’s internal ethnic struggle spread to its main base in Ndélé in the Bamingui-Bangoran prefecture (southwest of Vakaga prefecture) in April 2020, with dozens slaughtered. “General” Azor Kalité, a Bria-based Gula warlord and former senior member of the FPRC, and eight companions were arrested by MINUCA on suspicion of war crimes as the fighting continued in May (AFP, May 20, 2020; Monde Afrique, May 27, 2020). A pact of non-aggression between the Runga and Gula factions of the FPRC helped reduce the violence in August 2020. Ndélé was eventually recaptured by government forces in June 2021.

The Haute-Kotto and Vakaga prefectures are located on the historically turbulent fault line between Muslim north Africa and traditionally animist sub-Saharan Africa (which now includes many Christians). Many of the ethnic-groups of these regions converted to Islam in the 19th century as a way of attempting to evade enslavement by the Fulani, Arabs and Maba from Chad and Fur and Arabs from the Darfur sultanate (Muslims are forbidden to enslave other Muslims, though this restriction was not always observed in practice in Chad’s southern hinterland). Vakaga is the CAR’s northernmost prefecture and the only one to share borders with both Chad and Sudan. Though oil reserves are present in the region, it remains sparsely populated due to its depopulation by 19th century slave raids. Vakaga has been brought under some semblance of government control since the FACA/Russian/Rwandan offensive and many Hausa and Sara who fled to Sudan and Chad are considering a return (Corbeaunews [Bangui], January 31, 2022).

The Army of the Central African Republic

Senior FACA officers complain the Russians are recruiting their own battalions and deploying them to act as support units in their operations without respect to the FACA hierarchy (Corbeaunews [Bangui], December 21, 2021). To the chagrin of members of the European Union Training Mission (EUTM), many of their graduates, so carefully instructed in human rights issues, are heading straight into FACA battalions controlled by Russian mercenaries. The EUTM now focuses on strategic advice having suspended its training program two months ago over concerns it could not cooperate with Russian mercenaries that did not share the values of contributing European nations. An offer was made to resume training if Russian control of FACA ended and the army began to respect human rights, but these conditions seem unlikely to be met (Defense-gouv.fr, February 5, 2022).

A FACA soldier wearing the Wagner Group Death’s-Head patch (Corbeau News).

Of even greater concern is last year’s wave of arrests of former and active FACA senior officers by Russian contractors with the apparent acquiescence of the government:

Former FACA chief-of-staff General Ludovic Ngaïfei Lamademon was arrested at his home on January 16, 2021 and detained at the Camp Roux military prison, where he was questioned regarding his relationship with rebel CPC leaders. The arrest occurred when a column of FACA armored vehicles and Russian APCs smashed through the gates of his house, with FACA troops firing wildly despite the absence of any resistance. Ngaïfei was accused of organizing a coup against the government after speaking critically of the president in the local press. The retired general had been dismissed by President Touadéra following a dispute in 2018 (Corbeaunews [Bangui], February 1, 2021);

Colonel Rodongo, commander of FACA’s signals battalion, was arrested by the Russians in Kaga-Bandaro;

The Russians came for the captain-chief of the FACA detachment in Bria in July 2021. The officer fled to a local MINUSCA detachment, but was turned over to the interrogators of the research and investigation section of the CAR gendarmerie (Corbeaunews [Bangui], October 24, 2021).

Colonel Moussa Kitoko, commander of the north-east military zone, was arrested at Ndélé by Russian mercenaries, who accused the colonel of selling ammunition to the FPRC rebel movement (Corbeaunews [Bangui], October 24, 2021).

Chief Warrant Officer Guetel, head of the Berberati remand center, was also arrested by the Russians in mid-October, 2021.

Beside the arrests of their colleagues, FACA officers are, like their Chadian counterparts, unhappy with the system of promotion, which seems to elevate favorites of Touadéra or his Russian advisors. Despite the apparent success of the FACA/Russian/Rwandan offensive in early 2021, morale remains low in the army and defections to rebel groups are common. In August 2021, a group of soldiers of all ranks sent a 20-page letter to President Touadéra criticizing the handling of the army. The letter cited tribalism and favoritism in promotions, an unclear purpose for the army, the arrests of senior officers and the “humiliation and dishonor” in the ranks due to their subordination to the Wagner Company and Rwandan special forces: “Is it an army at the service of the people or an army to defend the interests of certain individuals who are in power?” (Journal de Bangui, August 23, 2021).

Female soldiers of FACA are no longer allowed on active operations due to the strong risk of sexual assault by their Russian allies under the influence of drugs and alcohol, something allegedly experienced by two out of three female recruits (Corbeaunews [Bangui], December 27, 2021; Letsunami.net [Bangui], January 15, 2022).

Major General and Chief of Staff of the Central African Armed Forces Zéphirin Mamadou is reported to work closely with General Oleg Polguyev, former intelligence chief of Russia’s airborne forces and a member of the official Russian mission (rather than Wagner).

Rwanda in the CAR

Rwanda is not a neighbor of the CAR, but, as with its earlier intervention in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the government of President Paul Kagame is interested in gaining access to mineral resources of the type found in the CAR.

The Rwandan component of MINUSCA consists of two infantry battalions, a mechanized battle group and a field hospital. Rwandans began providing protection for President Touadéra and other authorities in 2016 (East African (Nairobi), August 4, 2021). Rwanda is the largest single contributor to MINUSCA, with roughly 1700 troops and 500 policemen under UN command. [6]

In 2020, Rwanda deployed “force protection troops” from the Forces de Défense du Rwanda (FDR) to the CAR under a bilateral defense agreement. The agreement allowing Rwanda to deploy troops in the CAR outside the MINUSCA framework was signed in October 2019. Accompanying economic agreements gave Rwanda access to the CAR’s mining sector and permitted Rwandan officials to be inserted into CAR mining operations. The deployment came “in response to the targeting of the Rwanda Defense Force under the UN peacekeeping force by rebels supported by François Bozize” (Govt. of Rwanda, December 20, 2020). In early August 2021, another battalion of 750 troops from the FDR arrived in the CAR; one of their main tasks was to secure the vital highway connecting Bangui and Cameroon (New Times [Kigali], August 9, 2021).

According to Valery Zakharov, the Rwandans “act very efficiently and professionally. Of course, without the support of Rwanda, it would be difficult to repel the aggression of the militants and immediately go on the offensive. We are in constant contact with the Rwandan forces, as well as with all other partners” (Descifrando la Guerra, March 7, 2021).

Soldiers of Fortune in the CAR

Some European mercenaries have taken advantage of the CAR’s state of insecurity for their own profit. Horațiu Potra, a Romanian mercenary and former French Legionnaire, became involved in Baba Laddé’s plan to overthrow both François Bozizé and Idriss Déby. Potra, allegedly a dealer in war-zone diamonds, is closely associated with a number of rebels and mercenaries active in Chad and the CAR and was an instructor of the presidential guard of Ange-Félix Patassé.

Another shadowy adventurer is the Italian Elio Ciolini (a.k.a. Bruno Lugon, a.k.a. Bruno Raul Rivera Sanchez, a.k.a. Gino Bottoni Di Ferrara, a.k.a. Colonel Eliot). Nicknamed il faccendiere (“the henchman”), Ciolini has spent time in the prisons of several states on drug and weapons charges. Now working in the CAR as an “adviser to the presidency for national security,” Ciolini manufactured a fake coup attempt in Bangui while posing as “Colonel Eliot” of the European External Action Service (EEAS), the EU’s combined foreign and defence ministry. As “organizer” of the coup, Ciolini contacted a number of political and military leaders in the CAR in what seems to have been an attempt to flush out opponents of President Touadéra and his Russian backers. Ciolini was seen many times in Bangui in the company of Dmitri Alexandrov, a top Russian advisor to the president, before he disappeared in May 2020 (Jeune Afrique, July 1, 2020). Alexandrov (real name Dmitri Sergeevich Sytii) is a director of Lobaye Invest, a Russian mining firm tied to Prigozhin operating in the CAR. Sytii, who speaks four languages, works as an interpreter in high level talks and leads propaganda operations in Bangui that denounce MINUSCA and local politicians who resist the Russian expansion or favor a partnership with France.

Two days after France suspended a military training and operational support mission to the CAR in June 2021 to protest the failure of Ngrebada’s government to combat an anti-French disinformation campaign on social media, French national Juan Rémy Quignolot was charged with weapons, espionage and threats to state security (i.e., aiding and training rebel groups). The charges came a month after the former French paratrooper, known to work as a bodyguard for aid organizations, was arrested in Bangui with a small cache of weapons, a few camouflage uniforms and cash in several currencies. Though the arms seized from Quignolot were described in many places as “a very large arsenal” endangering the state, photos of the seized weapons and gear revealed only two hunting rifles (one with a scope), a handgun and an M-16 automatic rifle, nothing especially unusual for a security practitioner in an insecure region and certainly not enough to mount a coup, as CAR security has suggested was his intent. [7] Paris quickly characterized the arrest as a “manipulation” and part of an anti-French disinformation campaign after reports of the seized “arsenal” and arrest were prominently featured on Valery Zakharov’s Twitter account (al-Jazeera, June 9, 2021). The 55-year-old’s arrest came at a time when accusations were being made of human rights abuses by the Wagner Group in the CAR. According to his sister, Quignolot is being held in solitary confinement with a daily plate of rice to keep him alive as he faces a possible sentence of life at hard labor (Corbeaunews [Bangui], January 9, 2022).

Conclusion

In the CAR, it has become clear a cabinet of government ministers cannot be formed from rebel leaders and bandit chiefs, especially those who serve only themselves and have committed war-crimes and murders of CAR civilians. The impunity enjoyed by those rebel leaders now absorbed into the highest levels of the government only encourages others to view violence as the quickest path to wealth and influence. Such a structure cannot hold, hence the need for no-questions-asked assistance from mercenaries.

Alexander Bikantov, a proponent of a Russian presence in the CAR, is taking over as Russian ambassador this month from Vladimir Titorenko, who was perceived locally as inserting himself into CAR politics and was also occasionally at odds with Wagner Group officials. In October/November 2021, Bangui was visited by both Yevgeny Prigozhin and Wagner Group founder Dmitri Utkin in an attempt to calm growing differences between the Russians and CAR authorities.

Weak states compelled to hire mercenary forces to enable their survival are always at risk of the mercenaries taking over state institutions for their own profit, especially if expected wealth does not materialize. From the mutiny of mercenaries over pay in 3rd Century BCE Carthage to the mercenary mutinies in 1960s Congo, it is a familiar pattern. If continued insecurity in mineral-rich areas and pushback from CAR politicians delays the get-rich-quick schemes of the Russian mercenaries and their backers, the result could be an internal conflict that would both test and reveal Moscow’s control over the military contractors.

The Russians are strong enough to take rebel-held towns and territory, but lack sufficient numbers to occupy them, a task that is turned over to the unreliable forces of FACA. Rebel movements are, in classic guerrilla fashion, able to melt into the bush to await the departure of the Russians and Rwandans before moving back into their usual areas of operation. The incompetence of the national security forces prevents the delivery of state services and humanitarian relief to areas in desperate need of same, encouraging further rounds of rebellion. The victories obtained by the Russians are thus illusory; as elation over the initial success of the 2021 anti-rebel offensive dissipates and the mission becomes overwhelmed by the very real (but unprofitable) needs of the population, the Russian contractors will be more likely to focus on protecting the mining facilities operated by Russian interests.

The mandate for the EUTM to provide ethical and military training to FACA will expire in September 2022 and cannot be renewed without the approval of President Touadéra and his government. At the moment, training has been suspended, and if the mandate is not renewed (and it is questionable whether the EU at this point even has any interest itself in renewing it), it is likely that military training will fall to the Russians, completing their takeover of FACA.

Mercenaries are ultimately a poor means for states to project power and influence; without the discipline of formal military structures, they begin to act with an assumed license that is ultimately counterproductive to the interests of state sponsors. Such was the experience of the Americans with the Blackwater PMC in Iraq; even Bob Denard, with all his contacts in the French secret services, was eventually reined in and arrested by French troops in the Comoros Islands in 1995 after mounting his fourth coup attempt.

Managing the ever-shifting ethnic rivalries and alliances in rebellious and difficult-to-reach parts of the CAR will tax the patience of the small Russian force of advisors and mercenaries, intensifying a greater focus on profits rather than security. The Russian role in driving the rebel formations back into the bush has helped build Russian popularity in some sectors of society, but this may quickly evaporate if the contractors come to be seen as economic predators.

Russian invasion of Ukraine since 2014

The war in Donbas,[note 1] or the Donbas War, is an armed conflict in the Donbas region of Ukraine, part of the broader Russo-Ukrainian War. In March 2014, immediately following the Euromaidan protest movement and subsequent Revolution of Dignity, protests by pro-Russian, anti-government separatist groups took place in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine, collectively called the Donbas. These demonstrations began around the same time as Russia's annexation of Crimea, and were part of wider pro-Russian protests across southern and eastern Ukraine. Declaring the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR, respectively), armed Russian-backed separatist groups seized government buildings throughout the Donbas, leading to armed conflict with the Ukrainian government forces.[32]

While the initial protests were largely native expressions of discontent with the new Ukrainian government, Russia took advantage of them to launch a coordinated political and military campaign against Ukraine.[33] Russian citizens led the separatist movement in Donetsk from April until August 2014, and were supported by volunteers and materiel from Russia.[34][35][36] As the conflict escalated in May 2014, Russia employed a ""hybrid approach"", deploying a combination of disinformation, irregular fighters, regular Russian troops, and conventional military support to destabilize the Donbas.[37][38][39]

Ukraine launched a military counter-offensive against pro-Russian forces in April 2014, called the ""Anti-Terrorist Operation"" (ATO) from 2014 until 2018, when it was renamed the ""Joint Forces Operation"" (JFO).[40]: 4 [41] By late August 2014, this operation was able to vastly shrink the territory under the control of pro-Russian forces and came close to regaining control of the Russia–Ukraine border.[42] In response, Russia abandoned its hybrid approach and began a conventional invasion of the Donbas.[42][43] Following reports of Ukrainian positions being shelled from the Russian side of the border, between 22 and 25 August 2014, Russian artillery, personnel, and what Russia called a ""humanitarian convoy"" crossed the border. Russian crossings reportedly occurred both in areas that were controlled by pro-Russian forces and those that were not, such as the south-eastern part of Donetsk Oblast, near Novoazovsk.[44][45] Head of the Security Service of Ukraine, Valentyn Nalyvaichenko, called the events of 22 August a ""direct invasion by Russia of Ukraine"",[46] while other Western and Ukrainian officials called it a Russian ""stealth invasion"".[45] Russia's official position on the presence of Russian forces in the Donbas has been vague; while official bodies have denied the presence of ""regular armed forces"" in Ukraine, it has on many occasions confirmed the presence of ""military specialists"", along with other euphemisms, usually accompanied by an argument that Russia ""was forced"" to deploy them to ""defend the Russian-speaking population.""[47][48]

As a result of the Russian invasion, DPR and LPR insurgents regained much of the territory they had lost during the Ukrainian government's preceding military offensive.[40] Ukraine, Russia, the DPR and the LPR signed a ceasefire agreement, the Minsk Protocol, on 5 September 2014.[49] Violations of the ceasefire on both sides became common. Amidst the solidification of the line between insurgent and government-controlled territory during the ceasefire, warlords took control of swaths of land on the insurgent side, leading to further destabilisation.[50] The ceasefire collapsed in January 2015, with renewed heavy fighting across the conflict zone, including at Donetsk International Airport and at Debaltseve. Involved parties agreed to a new ceasefire, called Minsk II, on 12 February 2015. Immediately following the signing of the agreement, separatist forces launched an offensive on Debaltseve and forced Ukrainian forces to withdraw from it. In the months after the fall of Debaltseve, minor skirmishes continued along the line of contact, but no territorial changes occurred. The stalemate led to the war being labelled a ""frozen conflict"".[51] Despite this, the area remained a war zone, with dozens of soldiers and civilians killed each month.[52] In 2017, on average one Ukrainian soldier died in combat every three days,[53] with an estimated 6,000 Russian and 40,000 separatist troops in the region.[54][55] By the end of 2017, the OSCE observatory mission had counted around 30,000 individuals in military gear crossing from Russia to the Donbas at the two border checkpoints it was allowed to monitor.[56] The OSCE has also documented many cases of military convoys crossing from Russia into the occupied Donbas on dirt roads, away from official border crossings and usually at night.[57]

Since the start of the conflict there have been 29 ceasefires, each intended to remain in force indefinitely, but none of them have stopped the violence.[58][59][60] The most successful attempt to halt the fighting was in 2016, when a ceasefire was held for six weeks.[60] Ukraine, Russia, the DPR, the LPR and the OSCE agreed to a roadmap for ending the conflict on 1 October 2019.[61] However, the conflict did not thaw since then and, by late summer 2020, remained unresolved.[62][58] The latest ceasefire (29th)[58] came into force on 27 July 2020, which led to no Ukrainian combat losses for more than a month.[63][64][58] According to Ukrainian authorities, from 27 July until 7 November 2020 Ukrainian losses dropped tenfold (three Ukrainian soldiers were killed) and the number of attacks dropped five-fold.[65] The first trimester of 2021 saw a large rise in Ukrainian fatalities (25, compared with 50 deaths in the whole of 2020) and the buildup of a large Russian military force on the Donbas-Russian border from late March to early April 2021 and from late October and November 2021 onwards.[66]

Russia officially recognized the DPR and LPR on 21 February 2022, and on 24 February launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Background

Donetsk Oblast

Pro-Russian protesters in Donetsk , 9 March 2014

Attempts to seize the Donetsk regional state administration (RSA) building began since pro-Russian protests erupted in the eastern and southern regions of Ukraine, in the wake of the Revolution of Dignity. Pro-Russian protesters occupied the Donetsk RSA from 1 to 6 March 2014, before being removed by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU).[67] On 6 April, 1,000–2,000 people gathered at a rally in Donetsk to demand a status referendum similar to the one held in Crimea in March.[68]

The demonstrators stormed the RSA building, and took control of its first two floors. They said that if an extraordinary legislative session was not held by regional officials to implement a status referendum, they would take control of the regional government with a ""people's mandate"", and dismiss all elected regional councillors and members of parliament.[69] As these demands were not met, the activists held a meeting in the RSA building, and voted in favour of independence from Ukraine. They proclaimed the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) on 7 April 2014.[70]

Luhansk Oblast

Unrest in Luhansk Oblast began on 6 April, when approximately 1,000 activists seized and occupied the SBU building in the city of Luhansk, following similar occupations in the cities of Donetsk and Kharkiv.[71] Protesters barricaded the building, and demanded that all arrested separatist leaders be released.[71] Police were able to retake control of the building, but the demonstrators regathered for a 'people's assembly' outside the building and called for a 'people's government', demanding either federalisation or incorporation into the Russian Federation.[72] At this assembly, they elected Valery Bolotov to the position of ""People's Governor"".[73]

Two referendums were announced, one on 11 May to determine whether the region should seek some form of autonomy, and a second scheduled for 18 May to determine whether the region should join the Russian Federation, or declare independence.[74] The Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) was declared on 27 April.[75] Representatives of the Republic demanded that the Ukrainian government provide amnesty for all protesters, enshrine Russian as an official language, and hold a referendum on the status of the region.[75] They issued an ultimatum that stated that if Kyiv did not meet their demands by 14:00 on 29 April, they would launch an insurgency in tandem with that of the Donetsk People's Republic.[75]

History

April 2014: conflict begins

On 12 April, unmarked pro-Russian militants seized the Donetsk city office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and two other police offices in the oblast, although they were repelled after an assault on the general prosecutor's office and failed to take a police office in the city of Shakhtarsk.[76] Following negotiations between the militants and those in the building, the chief of the office resigned from his post.[76][77] Officers from the Berkut special police force, which had been dissolved by the government following the February revolution, took part in the seizure on the separatists' side.[78] After gaining control of the Donetsk RSA and declaring the Donetsk People's Republic, pro-Russian groups vowed to fan out and take control of strategic infrastructure across Donetsk Oblast, and demanded that public officials who wished to continue their work swear allegiance to the Republic.[79]

By 14 April, pro-Russian militants led by former GRU operatives Igor Girkin and Igor Bezler had taken control of government buildings in many other cities within the oblast, including Sloviansk, Mariupol, Horlivka, Kramatorsk, Yenakiieve, Makiivka, Druzhkivka, and Zhdanivka.[80][81][82] Following this seizure of the Donetsk RSA, the militants began to expand their control across the city. The municipal administration building was stormed and occupied by the insurgents on 16 April.[83] Further actions by the separatists resulted in the capture of the offices of the regional state television network on 27 April.[84] After capturing the broadcasting centre, the militants began to broadcast Russian television channels. On 4 May, the flag of the Donetsk People's Republic was raised over the police headquarters in Donetsk city proper.[85]

A number of interviews given in 2019–2020 by participants on the Russian side (including Girkin, Bezler, Gubarev and others) revealed that the initial idea to take control of Donbas towns was passed on to Donetsk ""People's Governor"" Pavel Gubarev by Sergey Glazyev, an advisor to Russian president Vladimir Putin at that time. Gubarev's team met Girkin's as it entered Ukraine from Russia, and the original plan was to capture Shakhtarsk first, as it was much closer to both the Russo-Ukrainian border and the Russian military base in Rostov-on-Don. The decision to attack Sloviansk instead was made after Girkin's group crossed the border, supposedly due to the presence of a larger group of pro-Russian activists ready to support their cause in the town. Military and financial support for the group was provided by Sergey Aksyonov and Konstantin Malofeev. Novaya Gazeta summarised the situation as ""a group of poorly prepared mercenaries turning a whole region into a bloodbath"" and concluded that Russia ""will bear moral and political responsibility for its civilian casualties as long as its participants are not taken to court.""[86]

In response to the widening unrest, the acting Ukrainian President, Oleksandr Turchynov, vowed to launch an ""Anti-Terrorist Operation"" (ATO) against separatist movements in Donetsk Oblast.[87] The Minister of Internal Affairs, Arsen Avakov, said on 9 April that the unrest in Donetsk Oblast would be resolved within 48 hours, either through negotiations or the use of force. President Oleksandr Turchynov signed a decree to retake the Donetsk RSA building, and place it ""under state protection"",[88][89] and offered amnesty to the demonstrators if they laid down their arms.[90]

Expansion of separatist territorial control

Sloviansk

Pro-Russian insurgents occupying the Sloviansk city administration building, 14 April 2014

A group of masked pro-Russian militants under the command of a retired FSB officer Igor Girkin took control of the city administration building, police offices, and SBU building in Sloviansk,[91] a city in the northern part of Donetsk Oblast, on 12 April.[76] After militants took over the city, Sloviansk mayor Nelya Shtepa briefly appeared at an occupied police station, and expressed support for the militants.[76] Others gathered outside the building and similarly voiced their support for the militants. They told Ukrainian journalists who were reporting on the situation to ""go back to Kyiv"".[76] Nelya Shtepa was later detained by the insurgents, and replaced by the self-proclaimed ""people's mayor"" Vyacheslav Ponomarev.[78]

The militants gained control of the city's police weapons cache and seized hundreds of firearms, which prompted the Ukrainian government to launch a ""counter-terrorism"" operation to retake the city.[78] This government counter-offensive began on the morning of 13 April.[92] As a result, an entrenched standoff between pro-Russian forces and the Armed Forces of Ukraine ensued, marking the start of combat in the Donbas.[93] The city remained under siege until 5 July, when Ukrainian forces recaptured it, with an estimated 15,000–20,000 people displaced by the fighting.[94] Mayor Shtepa was arrested on 11 July 2014 for allegedly colluding with pro-Russian forces.[95]

Shortly after taking control over Sloviansk, Girkin's group executed a member of town council, Volodymyr Ivanovych Rybak, as well as four other citizens of Ukraine, including 25-year-old Yuri Dyakovsky and an unnamed 19-year-old man. Girkin took responsibility for these executions in 2020, even though in the preceding years he and other pro-Russian militants had claimed Rybak had been released from custody.[86]

Kramatorsk

In Kramatorsk, a city in northern Donetsk Oblast, separatists attacked a police station on 13 April, resulting in a shootout.[96] The fighters, members of the Donbas People's Militia, later captured the police station. They removed the police station's sign and raised the flag of the Donetsk People's Republic over the building.[97] They then issued an ultimatum that stated that if the city's mayor and administration did not swear allegiance to the Republic by the following Monday, they would remove them from office.[97] Concurrently, a crowd of demonstrators surrounded the city administration building, captured it, and raised the Donetsk People's Republic flag over it. A representative of the Republic addressed locals outside the occupied police station, but was received negatively and booed.[97]

After a government counter-offensive as part of the ""Anti-Terrorist Operation"" in Donetsk Oblast on 2–3 May, the insurgents were routed from Kramatorsk's occupied SBU building.[98] Despite this, Ukrainian troops quickly withdrew from the city for unknown reasons, and the separatists quickly regained control. Sporadic fighting continued until 5 July, when the insurgents withdrew from Kramatorsk.[99]

Horlivka

Militants attempted to seize the police headquarters in Horlivka on 12 April, but were halted. Ukrayinska Pravda reported that police said that the purpose of the attempted seizure was to gain access to a weapons cache.[100] They said that they would use force if needed to defend the building from ""criminals and terrorists"".[101] By 14 April militants had captured the building after a tense standoff with the police.[80] Some members of the local police unit had defected to the Donetsk People's Republic earlier in the day, whilst the remaining officers were forced to retreat, allowing the insurgents to take control of the building.[102]

The local chief of police was captured and badly beaten by the insurgents.[103] A Horlivka city council deputy, Volodymyr Rybak, was kidnapped by masked men believed to be pro-Russian militants on 17 April. His body was later found in a river on 22 April.[104] The city administration building was seized on 30 April, solidifying separatist control over Horlivka.[105] Self-proclaimed mayor of Horlivka Volodymyr Kolosniuk was arrested by the SBU on suspicion of participation in ""terrorist activities"" on 2 July.

Mariupol

Mariupol police headquarters burnt-out after heavy fighting.

Donetsk People's Republic activists took control of the city administration building in Mariupol on 13 April.[106] The Ukrainian government claimed to have ""liberated"" the building on 24 April, but this was denied by locals interviewed by the BBC near the building.[107]

Clashes between government forces and pro-Russian groups escalated in early May when the city administration building was briefly retaken by the Ukrainian National Guard. The pro-Russian forces quickly took the building back.[108] Militants then launched an attack on a local police station, leading the Ukrainian government to send in military forces. Skirmishes between the troops and local demonstrators caused the city administration building to be set on fire.[who?] Government forces were unsuccessful in forcing out the pro-Russians, and only further inflamed tensions in Mariupol.[108]

On 16 May, Metinvest steelworkers, along with local police and security forces, routed the insurgents from the city administration and other occupied government buildings in the city.[109] Most insurgents left the city, and the few who remained were said to be unarmed.[who?] Despite this, the headquarters of the Donetsk People's Republic remained untouched, and pro-Russian demonstrators[clarification needed] could still be seen outside the burnt city administration.[110]

Ukrainian troops gained control of the city on 13 June with assistance from the National Guard.[111] The headquarters of the DPR was captured, and Mariupol was declared the provisional capital of Donetsk Oblast, instead of Donetsk city, which was occupied by separatists.[112]

Other cities

Many smaller cities across the Donbas fell to the separatists.

In Artemivsk on 12 April, separatists failed to capture the local Ministry of Internal Affairs office, but instead captured the city administration building and raised the DPR flag over it.[113] The city administration buildings in Yenakiieve and Druzhkivka were also captured.[114] Police repelled an attack by pro-Russian militants upon an office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Krasnyi Lyman on 12 April, but the building was later captured by the separatists after a skirmish.[115] Insurgents affiliated with the Donbas People's Militia occupied a regional administration building in Khartsyzk on 13 April, followed by a local administration building in Zhdanivka on 14 April.[81][116]

Demonstrators hoisted the DPR flag over the city administration buildings in Krasnoarmiisk and Novoazovsk on 16 April.[117] The local administration building in Siversk was similarly captured on 18 April. Following the takeover, local police announced that they would co-operate with the activists.[118] On 20 April, separatists in Yenakiieve left the city administration building there, which they had occupied since 13 April.[114] Despite this, by 27 May the city was still not under Ukrainian government control.[119] On 22 April pro-Russian demonstrators in Kostiantynivka burned down the offices of a newspaper that had been critical of the DPR.[120]

70 to 100 insurgents armed with assault rifles and rocket launchers attacked an armoury in Artemivsk on 24 April.[121] The depot housed around 30 tanks. Ukrainian troops attempted to fight off the insurgents, but were forced to retreat after many men were wounded by insurgent fire.[121] Minister of Internal Affairs Arsen Avakov said that the insurgents were led by a man with ""an extensive beard"", referring to the Russian militant Alexander Mozhaev.[121] Some 30 militants seized the police headquarters in Konstantinovka on 28 April.[122]

On 29 April, a city administration building in Pervomaisk was overrun by Luhansk People's Republic insurgents, who then raised their flag over it.[98][123] The same day, militants seized control of the city administration building in Alchevsk.[124] In Krasnyi Luch, the city administration conceded to demands by separatist activists that it support the referendums on the status of Donetsk and Luhansk of 11 May, and followed by raising the Russian flag over the city administration building.[123]

Insurgents occupied the city administration building in Stakhanov on 1 May. Later in the week, they captured the local police station, business centre, and SBU building.[125] Activists in Rovenky occupied a police building on 5 May, but quickly left it.[126] On the same day, the police headquarters in Slovianoserbsk was seized by members of the Army of the South-East, affiliated with the Luhansk People's Republic.[127] The town of Antratsyt was occupied by a number of renegade Don Cossacks.[128] Insurgents went on to seize the prosecutor's office in Sievierodonetsk on 7 May.[129] On the next day, supporters of the Luhansk People's Republic captured government buildings in Starobilsk.[130]

Government counter-offensive: the Anti-Terrorist Operation

The barricade outside the Donetsk RSA, with a slogan that asks the EU and US to ""go home"", alluding to claims of a Western intervention.

Arsen Avakov, the Minister of Internal Affairs, said on 9 April that the separatist problem would be resolved within 48 hours through either negotiations or the use of force. According to the Ukrinform state news agency, he said: ""There are two opposite ways for resolving this conflict – a political dialogue and the heavy-handed approach. We are ready for both."" Acting president Oleksandr Turchynov had already signed a decree which called for the Donetsk regional state administration building, occupied by separatists, to be taken ""under state protection"".[88][89] He offered amnesty to any separatists who laid down their arms and surrendered.[131] By 11 April Prime MMinister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said that he had been against the use of ""law enforcement"" at the time, but that ""there was a limit"" to how much the Ukrainian government would tolerate.[132]

In response to the spread of separatist control throughout Donetsk Oblast and the separatists' refusal to lay down their arms, Turchynov vowed to launch a military counter-offensive operation, called the ""Anti-Terrorist Operation"", against insurgents in the region on 15 April.[87] As part of the counter-offensive, Ukrainian troops re-took the airfield in Kramatorsk after a skirmish with members of the Donbas People's Militia. According to Russian media, at least four people died as a result.[133]

After the Armed Forces of Ukraine re-took the airfield, the commanding general of the unit that had retaken it, Vasyl Krutov, was surrounded by hostile protesters who demanded to know why the Ukrainian troops had fired upon local residents.[134] Krutov was then dragged back to the airbase along with his unit. They were then blocked by the protesters, who vowed not to let the troops leave the base.[134] Krutov later told reporters that ""if they [the separatists] do not lay down their arms, they will be destroyed"".[135] Donbas People's Militia insurgents entered Sloviansk on 16 April, along with six armoured personnel carriers they claimed to have obtained from the Ukrainian 25th Airborne Brigade, which had surrendered in the city of Kramatorsk.[136]

Reports say members of the brigade were disarmed after the vehicles were blocked from passing by angry locals.[137] In another incident, several hundred residents of the village of Pchyolkino, south of Sloviansk, surrounded another column of 14 Ukrainian armoured vehicles. Following negotiations, the troops were allowed to drive their vehicles away, but only after agreeing to surrender the magazines from their assault rifles.[137] These incidents led President Turchynov to disband the 25th Airborne Brigade.[138] Three members of the Donbas People's Militia were killed, 11 wounded, and 63 were arrested after they attempted and failed to storm a National Guard base in Mariupol.[139]

Turchynov relaunched the stalled counter-offensive against pro-Russian insurgents on 22 April, after two men, one a local politician, were found ""tortured to death"".[140] The politician, Volodymyr Rybak, was found dead near Sloviansk after having been abducted by pro-Russian insurgents. Turchynov said that ""the terrorists who effectively took the whole Donetsk Oblast hostage have now gone too far"".[140] The Internal Affairs Ministry reported that the city of Sviatogorsk, near Sloviansk, was retaken by Ukrainian troops on 23 April.[141] In addition, the Defence Ministry said it had taken control over all points of strategic importance in the area around Kramatorsk.[142]

A pro-separatist rally in Sloviansk, 9 May 2014

The Internal Affairs Minister, Arsen Avakov, said on 24 April that Ukrainian troops had captured the city administration in Mariupol, after a clash with pro-Russian demonstrators there.[143] Despite this, a report by the BBC said that whilst it appeared that Ukrainian troops and the mayor of Mariupol did enter the building in the early morning, Ukrainian troops had abandoned it by the afternoon. Local pro-Russian activists blamed Ukrainian nationalists for the attack upon the building but said that the DPR had regained control. A representative of the Republic, Irina Voropoyeva, said, ""We, the Donetsk People's Republic, still control the building. There was an attempted provocation but now it's over.""[143]

On the same day, Ukrainian government officials said that the Armed Forces had intended to retake the city of Sloviansk, but that an increased threat of ""Russian invasion"" halted these operations.[144] Russian forces had mobilised within 10 kilometres (6+1⁄4 mi) of the Ukrainian border.[144] The officials said that seven troops were killed during the day's operations. President Turchynov issued a statement later in the day, and said that the ""Anti-Terrorist Operation"" would be resumed, citing the ongoing hostage crisis in Sloviansk as a reason.[145] By 6 May 14 Ukrainian troops had died and 66 had been injured in the fighting.[146]

A standoff between pro-Russian locals and Ukrainian forces in Mariupol , 9 May 2014

Early in the morning on 7 May, the National Guard retook the city administration in Mariupol after heavy fighting with insurgents overnight.[147][better source needed] Anti-government demonstrators said that government forces had used tear gas during the operation, resulting in injuries when the demonstrators tried to re-occupy the building after the National Guard withdrew.[148] By the morning of 7 May, the flag of the DPR was once again flying over the building.[148]

Ukrainian troops launched another attack on insurgents in Mariupol on 9 May. During an assault on an occupied police building, that building was set alight by government forces, causing the insurgents to flee.[149] Arsen Avakov said that 60 insurgents attacked the police building, not Ukrainian troops and that the police and other government forces had managed to repel the insurgents. Between six and twenty militants were killed, along with one police officer.[150] Four militants were captured, and five policemen were wounded.[151]

One armoured personnel carrier was captured by pro-Russian protesters during the fighting. After the clashes, pro-Russian forces built barricades across the city centre.[150] Concurrently, Ukrainian National News said that separatists attempted to disarm Ukrainian troops near Donetsk. The troops resisted by firing warning shots, and arresting 100 of the separatists.[152] Also, an unnamed Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) priest attempted to negotiate with separatists near Druzhkivka, but was later killed after being shot eight times.[153] This was confirmed by the Church and the Prosecutor's Office.[154]

May 2014: post-referendum fighting

Church of the Holy Epiphany in Karlivka on 23 May

It was reported on 12 May that, following the local autonomy referendum, the Donbas People's Militia leader Igor Girkin declared himself ""Supreme Commander"" of the Donetsk People's Republic. In his decree, he demanded that all military stationed in the region swear an oath of allegiance to him within 48 hours, and said that all remaining Ukrainian military in the region would be ""destroyed on the spot"". He then petitioned the Russian Federation for military support to protect against ""the threat of intervention by NATO"" and ""genocide"".[155] Pavel Gubarev, president of Donetsk People's Republic, instituted martial law on 15 May, and vowed for ""total annihilation"" of Ukrainian forces if they did not pull out of the Donbas by 21:00. Similarly, the president of the Luhansk People's Republic, Valery Bolotov, declared martial law on 22 May.[156]

The Donetsk-based steel magnate Rinat Akhmetov called on his 300,000 employees within the Donetsk region to ""rally against separatists"" on 20 May. Sirens sounded at noon at his factories to signal the beginning of the rally.[157] A so-called ""Peace March"" was held in the Donbas Arena in Donetsk city, accompanied by cars sounding their horns at noon.[158] BBC News and Ukrayinska Pravda reported that some vehicles were attacked by separatists, and that gunmen had warned the offices of several city taxi services not to take part.[158]

In response to Akhmetov's refusal to pay taxes to the Donetsk People's Republic, on 20 May the chairman of the State Council of the DPR, Denis Pushilin, announced that the Republic would attempt to nationalise Akhmetov's assets.[159] On 25 May, between 2,000 and 5,000 protesters marched to Akhmetov's mansion in Donetsk city, and demanded the nationalisation of Akhmetov's property, while chanting ""Akhmetov is an enemy of the people!"".[160]

18 soldiers were killed during an insurgent attack upon an army checkpoint near the city of Volnovakha, on 22 May.[161] Three armoured personnel carriers and several lorries were destroyed in the attack, whilst one insurgent was killed.[162] On the same day, a convoy consisting of 100 soldiers attempted to cross a bridge at Rubizhne, Luhansk Oblast, and advance into insurgent-held territory.[163] They were ambushed by a group of between 300 and 500 insurgents. After fighting that lasted throughout the day, the soldiers were forced to retreat. Between two and fourteen soldiers and between seven and twenty insurgents were killed during the fighting. Three army infantry combat vehicles and one lorry were destroyed, and another three armoured vehicles were captured by the insurgents.[163][164] The Internal Affairs Ministry stated that some insurgents had attempted to enter Luhansk Oblast from Russia, but had been repelled by border guards.[165]

Following a declaration by Pavel Gubarev establishing the ""New Russia Party"" on 22 May, representatives of the Donetsk and Luhansk republics signed an agreement creating the confederative state of New Russia. Separatists planned to incorporate most of Ukraine's southern and eastern regions into the new confederation, including the key cities of Kharkiv, Kherson, Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhia and Odessa.[166] The declaration signed established the position of Russian Orthodoxy as the state religion and an intention to nationalise key industries.[167]

A separatist barricade in Luhansk city, April 2014

A unit of the pro-government Donbas Battalion volunteer paramilitary attempted to advance on a separatist checkpoint near the village of Karlivka, northwest of Donetsk city, on 23 May.[168] They were ambushed by a group of between 150 and 200 separatists, supported by one of the captured armoured personnel carriers. The pro-government paramilitary was surrounded by the separatists, and outnumbered six to one until fighters affiliated with the nationalist Right Sector broke through the separatist lines to allow some members of the group to escape.[168]

Five members of the Donbas Battalion were killed, along with four separatists.[168] Twenty members of the pro-government paramilitaries were wounded, and at least four were captured. The involvement of Right Sector was disputed by the leadership of the Donbas Battalion.[169] Pro-Russian leader Igor Bezler said that he executed all of the captured paramilitaries.[170] Another separatist leader confirmed four of their fighters were killed, and also said that ten pro-government paramilitaries and two civilians died.[164] During the same day, two pro-Russian separatists were killed during an assault by the pro-government ""Ukraine Battalion"" paramilitary on an occupied local government building in Torez.[171]

Airport battle and fighting in Luhansk

On the morning of 26 May 200 pro-Russian insurgents, including members of the Vostok Battalion, captured the main terminal of the Donetsk International Airport, erected roadblocks around it, and demanded that government forces withdraw.[172] Soon after these demands were issued, the Ukrainian National Guard issued an ultimatum to the separatists, asking them to surrender. This was subsequently rejected. Government forces then launched an assault on separatist positions at the airport with paratroopers and airstrikes.[173] Attack helicopters were used by government forces. They targeted a separatist-operated anti-aircraft gun.[174] An estimated 40 insurgents died in the fighting, with some civilians caught in the crossfire.[175] Between 15 and 35 insurgents were killed in a single friendly-fire incident, when two lorries carrying wounded fighters away from the airport were ambushed by insurgents mistaking them for Ukrainian forces.[176][177]

During the fighting at the airport, Druzhba Arena in Donetsk city was ransacked by pro-Russian insurgents, who looted the building and destroyed surveillance equipment, and set it ablaze.[178] Concurrently, Donetsk police said the insurgents had killed two policemen in the nearby town of Horlivka. The Moscow Times reported that the two men had been executed for ""breaking their oath to the Donetsk People's Republic"".[178]

Luhansk People's Republic-affiliated insurgents attacked a Ukrainian National Guard unit in the early hours of 28 May.[179]

Escalation in May and June 2014

Mykhailo Koval, the Minister of Defence, said on 30 May that Ukrainian government forces had ""completely cleared"" the insurgents from the southern and western parts of Donetsk Oblast and the northern part of Luhansk Oblast.[180] Meanwhile, an internal coup replaced the leadership of the Donetsk People's Republic, and some bodies of Russian fighters killed in the airport battle were repatriated to Russia.[181]

Luhansk border post siege

Two separatists were killed in a skirmish with Ukrainian border guards on 31 May.[182] Two days later, five separatists were killed when 500 separatists attacked a border post in Luhansk Oblast. Eleven border guards and eight separatists were wounded during the fighting,[183] which also killed one civilian.[184]

2 June Luhansk airstrike

On 2 June, eight people were killed and more than 20 wounded by a series of explosions hitting the occupied RSA building in Luhansk city.[185] Separatists blamed the incident on a government airstrike, while Ukrainian officials denied this, and claimed that the explosions were caused by a stray surface-to-air missile fired by insurgents.[186] The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) published a report on the next day, stating that based on ""limited observation"", they believed that the explosion was caused by an airstrike, supporting separatist claims.[187]

A CNN investigation found clear evidence that the attack came from the air and the pattern of the craters suggested use of standard equipment on the Su-25, a ground-attack fighter, and the Su-27 – both combat aircraft operated by Ukraine.[185] Radio Liberty also concluded that ""Despite Denials, All Evidence For Deadly Explosion Points To Kyiv"".[188] CNN said that it was the first time that civilians had been killed in an attack by the Ukrainian air force during the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in the Donbas.[185] The next day, Luhansk People's Republic declared a three-day mourning in the city.[189]

Continued fighting

Government forces destroyed a separatist stronghold in Semenivka, and regained control of Krasnyi Lyman on 3 June.[190] Two soldiers were killed in the fighting, and forty-five were wounded. A spokesman for the Armed Forces of Ukraine said that 300 insurgents were killed during the operation and that 500 were wounded. Insurgents said they lost between 10 and 50 men.[191] They said that at least 25 were killed while in hospital at Krasnyi Lyman.[192] None of these reports were independently confirmed, and both sides denied the other's accounts of the battle.[191]

On the next day, insurgents captured the besieged Luhansk border post, as well as a National Guard base near Luhansk city. The fighting in these areas left six insurgents dead, and three government soldiers wounded. Another border post was captured by the insurgents in Sverdlovsk.[193] The National Guard base fell after guardsmen ran out of ammunition. Separatists had earlier seized vast quantities of munitions from the captured border post.[194]

Another border post was attacked on 5 June, in the village of Marynivka.[195] Government officials said that between 15 and 16 insurgents were killed and that 5 soldiers were injured as well.[196] A shootout between rival separatist groups in Donetsk city took place on 7 June, near the Donetsk RSA. The vice-president of the Donetsk People's Republic, Maxim Petrukhin, was killed in the fighting, and president Denis Pushilin was wounded.[197]

Russian tank incursion

Ukrainian officials said that Russia had allowed tanks to cross the Russo-Ukrainian border into Donetsk Oblast on 11 June. Internal Affairs Minister Arsen Avakov said ""we have observed columns passing with armoured personnel carriers, other armoured vehicles and artillery pieces, and tanks which, according to our information, came across the border and this morning were in Snizhne"". He continued by saying Ukrainian forces had destroyed part of the column, and that fighting was still under way. Reuters correspondents confirmed the presence of three tanks in Donetsk city, and the US State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research also said that Russia had indeed sent tanks, along with other heavy weapons, to the separatists in Ukraine.[198]

The weapons sent are said to include: a column of three T-64 tanks, several BM-21 Grad multiple rocket launchers, and other military vehicles. ""Russia will claim these tanks were taken from Ukrainian forces, but no Ukrainian tank units have been operating in that area,"" the State Department said in a statement. ""We are confident that these tanks came from Russia.""[199] The newly elected Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, said that it was ""unacceptable"" for tanks to be crossing into Ukraine. Russia called the reports ""another fake piece of information.""[200] Nevertheless, the three tanks were later spotted moving through Makiivka and Torez, flying the flag of the Russian Federation.[201] Insurgents confirmed that they had obtained three tanks, but leaders refused to elaborate on how they acquired them; one militant told reporters that they originated ""from a military warehouse"".[202]

The president of the DPR, Denis Pushilin, stated that the three tanks would be stationed in Donetsk city and that they gave his forces ""at least some hope of defending [Donetsk] because heavy weapons are already being used against us.""[202] Konstantin Mashovets, a former Ukrainian Defence Ministry official, said the tanks had likely been seized by Russian forces in Crimea before making their way into mainland Ukraine. Anton Heraschenko, an advisor to Arsen Avakov, confirmed at a briefing in Kyiv that the tanks were once in the possession of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Crimea, and that they had been transferred by sea to Russia before crossing the border into Ukraine.[203]

On the day after the tank incursion, three soldiers were killed when they were ambushed by insurgents in Stepanivka.[204] Heavy fighting resumed during the morning of 13 June, when the government launched a new attack against insurgents in Mariupol. Ukrainian troops managed to recapture the city, and declared it the ""provisional capital"" of Donetsk Oblast until the government regains control over Donetsk city.[205] Meanwhile, an agreement between the Minister of Internal Affairs, Arsen Avakov, and the president of the DPR, Denis Pushilin, meant to create a ceasefire and allow civilians to escape the violence in Sloviansk failed, with both sides blaming each other for launching new attacks.[206] During the next morning, a convoy of border guardsmen was attacked by insurgents while passing Mariupol, leaving at least five of the guardsmen dead.[207]

Ilyushin Il-76 shoot-down

A Ukrainian Air Force Ilyushin Il-76MD was shot down by forces aligned with the Luhansk People's Republic on 14 June.[208] The aircraft was preparing to land at Luhansk International Airport, and was carrying troops and equipment from an undisclosed location. All 49 people on board died.[208] Meanwhile, two T-72 tanks entered Donetsk, and a skirmish erupted at a military checkpoint in Luhansk, lasting two days.[209]

Battle of Yampil

Late on 19 June, a battle fought with tanks and armoured vehicles broke out in the town of Yampil, near government-held Krasnyi Lyman. Up to 4,000 insurgents were present for the fighting, which started, according to the insurgents, after the Armed Forces attempted to capture insurgent-held Yampil,[210] with the goal of breaking through to Siversk.[211] According to the Armed Forces, it started after insurgents attempted to break through a cordon of government troops around government-held Krasny Lyman. The battle was described as exceeding ""in terms of force and scale anything there has been"" during the conflict in the Donbas.[212]

The Armed Forces deployed both air and artillery strikes in their attempts to rout the insurgents.[213] The battle continued into the next day. Overnight, between 7 and 12 soldiers were killed and between 25 and 30 were wounded. The Armed Forces said they killed 300 insurgents, but this was not independently verified,[214] the separatists confirmed only two deaths and seven wounded on their side.[213] The insurgents also said they destroyed one tank, several BMD-1s, and also shot down a Su-25 bomber.[215]

The Ukrainian military said that they had gained control of Yampil and Siversk on 20 June 20 hours before a unilateral ceasefire by Ukrainian forces, as part of Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko's 15-point peace plan.[216] They also acknowledged that there was still heavy fighting in the area around Yampil, and the village of Zakitne.[217] By this point, the number of soldiers killed in the battle had reached 13.[218] During the continued fighting, militants blew up a bridge over a river in the village of Zakitne.[219]

July 2014: post-ceasefire government offensive

After a week-long ceasefire unilaterally declared by Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko ended, the Armed Forces renewed their operations against the insurgents on 1 July. Shelling occurred in Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, and government forces retook a border crossing in Dolzhansk, one of the three major border crossings occupied by the separatists. Government forces also recaptured the villages of Brusivka and Stary Karavan.[220] On the same day, insurgents in Luhansk said that they had taken control of Luhansk International Airport.[221] On 1 July 2014 in Donetsk a street gunfight broke between rival factions of pro-Russian militants, which resulted in one person being fatally wounded and two others in critical conditions.[222]

Internal Affairs Ministry spokesman Zoryan Shkyriak said that over 1,000 pro-Russian insurgents were killed in the first day following the resumption of hostilities.[223] Liga.net, citing a source involved with the government military operation, reported that over 400 insurgents were killed in action, but that the higher figures reported earlier could not be confirmed.[224] Separatists themselves reported only two deaths in fighting at Mykolaivka.[225]

Insurgents attacked a border post in Novoazovsk on 2 July. During the attack, mortars were fired upon the post, and clashes broke out. One border guard was killed in the fighting, and another eight guardsmen were injured.[226] Government forces recaptured the town of Mykolaivka, near Sloviansk, on 4 July. A group of DPR-affiliated militants defected as a result, and joined the Ukrainian army.[227]

In a further blow to the insurgents, government forces retook the stronghold of Sloviansk on 5 July.[94] Commander of the DPR insurgents, Igor Girkin, took the decision ""due to the overwhelming numerical superiority of the enemy"", according to DPR prime minister Alexander Borodai. He said that DPR forces had retreated to Kramatorsk, but BBC News reported that they were seen abandoning their checkpoints in Kramatorsk.[94] Later that day, Borodai confirmed that the insurgents had abandoned ""the entire northern sector"", including Kramatorsk, and had retreated to Donetsk city.[99] After the retreat of Girkin's forces to Donetsk, he assumed control of the DPR, replacing the previous authorities there in what was described as a ""coup d'état"".[228]

Subsequently, Ukraine's Armed Forces recaptured Druzhkivka, Kostyantynivka, and Artemivsk.[229] Amidst the insurgent retreat, Donetsk city mayor Oleksandr Lukyanchenko said that at least 30,000 people had left the city since April.[230] In a separate development, Ukrainian forces said they spotted two aerial drones in Mariupol, and shot one of them down.[231]

Ahead of a planned government offensive on the insurgent-occupied city of Donetsk, key roads leading into the city were blocked on 7 July.[232] Insurgents destroyed railway bridges over the roads, causing them to collapse and block the roads. Defence Minister Valeriy Heletey stated on 8 July that there would be ""no more unilateral ceasefires"", and said dialogue was only possible if the insurgents laid down their weapons.[233] More fighting broke out at Luhansk International Airport on 9 July.[234] LPR-affiliated insurgents said that they had captured the airport on 1 July, but the Ukrainian army managed to maintain control over it. More than 10,000 households in Luhansk Oblast are without gas service due to damage to gas lines, according to a statement on the same day by the regional gas supplier.[235]

Clashes at the Donetsk International Airport continued on 10 July. Insurgents fired mortars at the airport, and attempted to recapture it, but were repelled by the Armed Forces.[236] Ukrainian forces also retook the city of Siversk, which was confirmed by the insurgents.[237] On the same day, the Luhansk city administration reported that six civilians had been injured due to ongoing hostilities across the city.[238] There were also reports of factionalism among the separatists, with some desertions. According to these reports, the Vostok Battalion had rejected the authority of Igor Girkin. Alexander Borodai, prime minister of the DPR, denied these reports, however, and said that they were lies.[239]

Heavy fighting continued in Luhansk Oblast on 11 July. On that day, an Armed Forces column travelling near Rovenky was attacked by an insurgent-operated Grad rocket lorry.[240] An air strike launched by the Armed Forces eventually managed to destroy the rocket launcher, but only after 23 soldiers were killed.[241] In response to the attack, Ukrainian president Poroshenko said that ""For every life of our soldiers, the militants will pay with tens and hundreds of their own"".[240] On the next day, the Ukrainian Air Force launched air strikes targeting insurgent positions across Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.[242] The Ukrainian government said that 500 insurgents were killed in these strikes, which they said were retaliations for the separatist rocket attack on the previous day. Four people were killed at Marinka, a western suburb of Donetsk city, after rockets struck an insurgent-held area of the city. The Ukrainian government and separatists blamed each other for the attack.[243]

Fighting worsens in eastern Donetsk Oblast

After a brief lull following the insurgent withdrawal from the northern part of Donetsk Oblast, fighting continued to escalate sharply in the eastern parts of Donetsk Oblast. Shells landed on the border town of Donetsk in Rostov Oblast, a part of Russia, on 13 July.[244] One civilian was killed in the shelling. Russian officials blamed the Armed Forces of Ukraine for the shelling, whilst Ukraine denied responsibility and accused insurgents in the Donbas of having staged a false flag attack.[245] Russia said it was considering launching airstrikes against government targets in Ukraine as retaliation for the shelling.[246]

Ukrainian forces went on to make gains around Luhansk, ending an insurgent blockade of Luhansk International Airport. LPR officials acknowledged that they lost 30 men during fighting in the village of Oleksandrivka.[247] The insurgent-occupied town of Snizhne was hit by rockets fired from an aeroplane on 15 July, leaving at least 11 people dead, and destroying multiple homes.[248] The insurgents blamed the Air Force of Ukraine, but the Ukrainian government denied any involvement in the attack.

Clashes broke out between insurgents and the Armed Forces along the border with Russia in Shakhtarsk Raion on 16 July. Insurgents who had been holed up in the town of Stepanivka made an attempt to escape encirclement by government forces at 05:00.[249] According to a report by the National Guard, a roadblock near the border village of Marynivka was attacked by the insurgents with tanks, mortar fire, and anti-tank missiles.[250] The checkpoint was shelled for over an hour, causing significant damage to infrastructure in Marynivka. Guardsmen managed to repel the attack, and forced the insurgents back to Stepanivka, where fighting continued.[250] The battle then moved to the nearby village of Tarany. At least 11 Ukrainian soldiers died in the fighting.[249] Attempts to form a ""contact group"" between the insurgents and the Ukrainian government, part of President Poroshenko's ""15-point peace plan"", failed, leaving little hope of a renewed ceasefire.[249] The insurgents later said that they successfully retook Marynivka from the Armed Forces.[251]

Downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17

A civilian passenger jet, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, was shot down over Hrabove (a village in the Donetsk Oblask) on 17 July 2014, killing all 298 people on board. DPR-affiliated insurgents blamed the Ukrainian government for the disaster, whereas the government, Netherlands, and Australia blamed Russia and the insurgents.[252][253] The responsibility for investigation was delegated to the Dutch Safety Board (DSB) and the Dutch-led joint investigation team (JIT), who concluded that the airliner was downed by a Buk surface-to-air missile launched from pro-Russian separatist-controlled territory in Ukraine.[254][255] According to the JIT, the Buk that was used originated from the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade of the Russian Federation,[256][257] and had been transported from Russia on the day of the crash, fired from a field in a separatist-controlled area, and the launcher returned to Russia after it was used to shoot down MH17.[258][256][259]

On the basis of the JIT's conclusions, the governments of the Netherlands and Australia hold Russia responsible for the deployment of the Buk installation and are taking steps to hold Russia formally accountable.[252][253] This disaster followed two similar incidents earlier in the week, when two Ukrainian Air Force planes were shot down.[260] Meanwhile, fighting in Luhansk resulted in the loss of electrical power and water services across the city.[261] Shelling damaged an electrical substation in the district Kamennobrodskiy, causing the power loss. An oil refinery in Lysychansk was also set alight.[261]

At least 20 civilians were killed in the shelling of Luhansk, according to a statement by the city administration.[262] The statement said that a barrage of rockets hit ""virtually every district"". The shelling forced OSCE monitors to flee from their office in Luhansk, and move to Starobilsk.[263] Government forces went on to capture the south-eastern section of the city.[264] Another 16 people died overnight, and at least 60 were wounded.[265] According to a government report, Luhansk airport was secured by government forces amidst the battle.[266]

Government push into Donetsk and Luhansk cities

A damaged tower block in Lysychansk, 28 July 2014

Heavy fighting also resumed around Donetsk airport overnight, and explosions were heard in all districts of the city. The city fell quiet by 09:00 on 19 July.[267] By 21 July, heavy fighting in Donetsk had begun again.[268] Donetsk was rocked by explosions, and heavy weapons fire caused smoke to rise over the city. Fighting was concentrated in the northwestern districts of Kyivskyi and Kuibyshevskyi, and also near the central railway station and airport, leading local residents to seek refuge in bomb shelters, or to flee the city.[269] The city's water supply was cut off during the fighting, and all railway and bus service was stopped.[270] The streets emptied, and insurgents erected barricades across the city to control traffic.[271] The cities of Dzerzhynsk, Soledar, and Rubizhne[272] were also recaptured by government forces.[273]

The suburb of Mayorsk, just outside Horlivka, and the city of Sievierodonetsk, in Luhansk Oblast, were recaptured by the Armed Forces on 22 July.[274] OSCE monitors visiting Donetsk following the previous day's fighting there said that the city was ""practically deserted"", and that the fighting had stopped.[275] On the same day, DPR prime minister Alexander Borodai said that he wanted to resume ceasefire talks. DPR commander Igor Girkin also said ""The time has come when Russia must take a final decision – to really support Donbas's Russians or abandon them forever"".[276] Also, the pro-Ukrainian paramilitary Donbas Battalion captured Popasna.[277]

A destroyed railway flyover, 25 July 2014

After having retaken Sievierodonetsk, government forces fought insurgents around the neighbouring city of Lysychansk.[278] An insurgent car bomb killed three soldiers during the fighting there. Grad rocket attacks were launched against government forces garrisoned at Vesela Hora, Kamysheve, and also Luhansk airport. The press centre for the government military operation said that situation remained ""most complex"" in the areas around ""Donetsk city, Luhansk city, Krasnodon and Popasna"".[279] Government forces broke through the insurgent blockade around Donetsk airport on 23 July and then advanced into the northwestern corner of Donetsk city.[280]

Subsequently, the insurgents withdrew from many areas on the outskirts of the city, including Karlivka, Netailove [uk], Pervomaiske [uk], and the area around Donetsk airport.[280] Insurgent commander Igor Girkin said that this was done to fortify Donetsk city centre, and also to avoid being encircled by government forces. He also said that he did not expect a government incursion into Donetsk city centre.[280] Meanwhile, clashes continued in Shakhtarsk Raion, along the border with Russia. Amidst the fighting, two Ukrainian Su-25 fighter jets that had been providing air support to ground forces near Dmytrivka were shot down by the insurgents.[281]

On July 24 government forces recaptured Lysychansk.[282] On the same day, fighting raged around Horlivka.[283] Government forces launched air and artillery strikes on insurgents within the city, and clashes were fought all around it. One important bridge collapsed in the fighting, severing a critical route out of the city. People fled the violence in cars and on foot.[283] Despite these advances by the Armed Forces, the border with Russia was not secured. Izvaryne border post in Luhansk Oblast, which is controlled by the Army of the South-East, was reported to be the main entry point for weapons and reinforcements from Russia.[283] Shelling began again in the Kyivskyi, Kirovskyi and Petrovskyi districts of Donetsk city. According to Donetsk city administration, 11 houses were damaged in Petrovsky, and at least one man was injured.[284] The fighting continued overnight into 26 July, with explosions, shelling, and shooting heard across the city.[285]

During the third day of the government's offensive on the insurgent-stronghold of Horlivka, between 20 and 30 civilians were killed on 27 July.[286] Horlivka was virtually abandoned, with electric power and water cut off. Shelling damaged or destroyed many buildings, including a hospital, greengrocer's, and energy company office.[287] Ukrainian troops also entered the town of Shakhtarsk, fought the insurgents that had been occupying it, and captured it around 14:30.[288] This cut off the supply corridor between the territories held by the DPR and LPR, isolating insurgents in Donetsk city.[289]

Skirmishes also broke out in the nearby towns of Snizhne and Torez. The intense combat across Shakhtarsk Raion forced a party of Dutch and Australian policemen to call off an attempt to investigate the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17.[290] 41 Ukrainian soldiers deserted their posts and went to the insurgent-controlled Izvaryne border crossing, where they told insurgents that they refused to fight against their ""own people"".[291] The insurgents allowed them to flee Ukraine, and cross into Russia.[citation needed] By 28 July, the strategic heights of Savur-Mohyla were under Ukrainian control, along with the town of Debaltseve.[292]

Insurgents had previously used Savur-Mohyla to shell Ukrainian troops around the town of Marynivka.[293] By 29 July, a further 17 civilians had been killed in the fighting, along with an additional 43 people injured.[294] Shelling continued in the Leninskyi and Kyivskyi districts of Donetsk city. According to the city administration, these districts were heavily damaged.[295]

According to a report by National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, crossing points on the border with Russia were attacked from Russian territory at least 153 times since 5 June.[296] 27 border guardsmen were killed in these attacks, and 185 were injured. Government forces made a further advance on 30 July, when they evicted insurgents from Avdiivka, near Donetsk airport.[297] Military operations were paused on 31 July.[298] This was meant to allow international experts to examine the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, which is located in Shakhtarsk Raion, where the fiercest battles had been taking place on the previous few days. Monitors were escorted to the site by the Armed Forces of Ukraine.[299]

After fighting severed various transmission lines, Luhansk city lost all access to electrical power.[299] Little fuel remained to power emergency generators. Minor skirmishes occurred in Vasylivka and Zhovtneve.[300] Meanwhile, talks between the separatists, Russia, Ukraine, and the OSCE were held in Minsk.[298] Fighting continued in Shakhtarsk. An ambush by the insurgents on government forces there resulted in the deaths of ten soldiers.[301] 11 went missing, and 13 were wounded. A government offensive on the city of Pervomaisk in Luhansk Oblast continued.[301]

Following a series of military defeats, Igor Girkin, insurgent commander for the DPR, urged Russian military intervention, and said that the combat inexperience of his irregular forces, along with recruitment difficulties amongst the local population in Donetsk Oblast had caused the setbacks. He addressed Russian president Vladimir Putin, saying that ""Losing this war on the territory that President Vladimir Putin personally named New Russia would threaten the Kremlin's power and, personally, the power of the president"".[302] Government forces closed in on Luhansk and Donetsk cities on 3 August.[303]

A number of civilians were killed in fighting in both cities. Luhansk was reported to be ""virtually surrounded"", with little electrical power or water supply available. The situation in the city of Donetsk was less dire, as trains to Russia were still running, but fighting and shelling did not relent.[303] According to the Armed Forces, three-quarters of the territory once held by the insurgents had been recaptured.[304] They also said that they had completely cut off supply lines between the DPR and LPR, after more than a week of fighting in Shakhtarsk Raion.[305]

After a prolonged battle, the Armed Forces recaptured the vital town of Yasynuvata on 4 August.[306] At least five soldiers died in the fighting to capture the town, which is a strategic railway junction on the main road between Donetsk and Luhansk cities. The pro-government paramilitary Azov and Shakhtarsk battalions said that they had advanced into Donetsk city, and had begun to ""liberate"" it.[307] The Ukrainian government said that all civilians should evacuate from Donetsk, and issued statements asking DPR and LPR forces to help establish ""humanitarian corridors"" to allow civilians in Donetsk, Luhansk and Horlivka to flee.[308] Commenting on the situation in Luhansk, mayor Sergei Kravchenko said ""As a result of the blockade and ceaseless rocket attacks, the city is on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe"".[309]

As government troops pushed into Donetsk on 5 August, heavy fighting erupted at 17:00 in the Petrovskyi district of the city.[310] Elsewhere, insurgents recaptured the town of Yasynuvata after a retreat by government forces.[311] A spokesman from the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine said that the Armed Forces left the town to avoid harming the ""peaceful population"", and that the city was being evacuated so that it could be ""completely liberated"".[312] He also said that the railway station remained under government control, and that all railway traffic had been blocked. Fighting between insurgents and government forces across the Donbas region continued ""constantly"" over the course of the day.[313]

Fighting and shelling continued around Donetsk on 8 August, with several civilians killed or injured.[314] By 9 August, insurgent commander Igor Girkin said that Donetsk had been ""completely encircled"" by government forces.[315] This followed the capture of the vital town of Krasnyi Luch by the government, after insurgent-aligned Cossacks stationed there fled.[315] Further skirmishes between insurgents and the Armed Forces took place in Mnohopillia, Stepanivka, Hryhorivka, Krasny Yar, Pobeda, Shyshkove, Komyshne, Novohannivka, Krasna Talivka, Dmytrivka, Sabivka, and Luhansk airport.[316]

Overnight and into 10 August, government forces launched an artillery barrage on Donetsk city, causing ""massive damage"" across it.[317] According to a spokesman for the Armed Forces, insurgents began to flee the city during the barrage, and were in a state of ""panic and chaos"". Hospitals and residential buildings were heavily damaged, and many remaining residents took shelter in basements.[317] The cities of Pervomaisk, Kalynove, Komyshuvakha, in western Luhansk Oblast near Popasna, were captured by government forces on 12 August after heavy fighting.[318] Heavy shelling of Donetsk continued into 14 August.[319]

During this artillery barrage, Igor Girkin resigned from his post as commander of the insurgent forces of the Donetsk People's Republic.[320] He was replaced by Vladimir Kononov, who is known by the nom de guerre Tsar.[321] Girkin's resignation, along with the 7 August resignation of DPR prime minister Alexander Borodai (who was replaced by Alexander Zakharchenko), represented a shift in the nature of the conflict. Given the recent military failings of the DPR and the LPR, Russia decided that it could no longer rely on a patchwork of irregular fighters in the Donbas, and ordered a change in leadership.[322] It abandoned the separatist project, and replaced it with the idea of federalisation of Donbas within Ukraine. To effect this change, it would soon switch gears from hybrid warfare to conventional warfare.[323]

Later in the day on 14 August, a convoy of some two dozen armoured personnel carriers and other vehicles with official Russian military plates crossed into Ukraine near the insurgent-controlled Izvaryne border crossing.[324][325] NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen confirmed that a ""Russian incursion"" into Ukraine had occurred.[326] Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko said that Ukrainian artillery engaged and destroyed a ""significant"" portion of the armoured column.[327] The Russian Defence Ministry denied the existence of any such convoy.[328] Following this incident, the newly appointed prime minister of the DPR Alexander Zakharchenko said that his forces included 1,200 Russian-trained combatants.[329]

A Ukrainian Air Force MiG-29 fighter jet was shot down by the insurgents in Luhansk Oblast on 17 August. Ten civilians were killed during continued shelling in Donetsk.[330] The insurgent-occupied city of Horlivka was encircled by the Armed Forces on 18 August.[331] Government forces also advanced into the edges of Luhansk city. A convoy of refugees from Luhansk was hit by Grad rockets near the village of Novosvitlivka. Dozens of civilians died in the attack, which the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine blamed on the insurgents. Insurgents denied attacking any refugee convoys.[331] DPR prime minister Aleksandr Zakharchenko stated that if the Ukrainian government made ""reasonable proposals to lay down arms, close borders, we will talk on equal terms as equal partners"".[332] He added, however, that the government ""must recognise us as a state, now it is already impossible to ask for a certain degree of autonomy"".[332]

After having edged into Luhansk city on 18 August, government forces began to advance through the city ""block by block"" on 19 August.[333][334] Fighting was heard in streets across the city, and shelling of many insurgent-occupied districts continued. There was also fighting Makiivka and Ilovaisk, two cities just outside Donetsk city. A spokesman for the Internal Affairs Ministry said that government forces were ""clearing"" Ilovaisk of insurgents, and later captured most of the city.[333][335] The headquarters of the DPR in Donetsk city were also shelled. Fighting across Donetsk Oblast on 19 August resulted in the deaths of 34 civilians.[336] By early evening on 20 August, government forces said that they had recaptured ""significant parts"" of the city of Luhansk, after a series of running battles in streets throughout the day.[337]

By 25 August, an insurgent counter-offensive had stalled the government's offensive on Donetsk and Luhansk cities.[338] Insurgents attacked government positions in Shchastia, and along the Siverskyi Donets River in Luhansk Oblast. As this attack occurred, insurgents in Luhansk received reinforcements. Government forces near Ilovaisk and Amvrosiivka in Donetsk Oblast became surrounded by insurgents, after their attempt to take Ilovaisk was halted by heavy shelling.[338] The pro-government volunteer Donbas Battalion, trapped in the city for days by the insurgents, accused the Ukrainian government and Armed Forces of ""abandoning"" them.[339]

Other volunteer battalions, such as the Azov and Dnipro, left Ilovaisk after encountering heavy resistance. Donbas Battalion leader Semen Semenchenko said ""I think it is profitable for the defence ministry not to send help, but to achieve a situation where volunteer battalions start blaming each other about who helped who"".[340] DPR forces stated their intention to ""fight their way to the Azov Sea"" on 23 August.[341] In line with this statement, an artillery barrage rained down on the coastal city of Novoazovsk, in southern Donetsk Oblast.[341]

A column of armoured vehicles crossed into Ukraine from Russia near Novoazovsk on 25 August.[44][342] There were no insurgent formations within 30 kilometres (18+2⁄3 mi) of this area for many weeks.[343] Heavy fighting took place in the village of Markyne, 7 kilometres (4+1⁄4 mi) from Novoazovsk. Insurgents used the village as a base to shell Novoazovsk.[344] A spokesman for the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine said that the entrance of the column into Ukraine was an attempt ""by the Russian military in the guise of Donbas fighters to open a new area of military confrontation"".[342]

According to the Mariupol city website, the Dnipro and Donbas battalions repelled the attack, and the ""invaders"" retreated to the border.[345] Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said he had no knowledge of the incident, and suggested that reports of the incident being an incursion by Russian forces were ""disinformation.""[346] Directly prior to the appearance of the column, the area was heavily shelled. The nearest insurgent artillery positions were beyond the range of this area.[343]

Villagers from Kolosky in Starobesheve Raion told Reuters that military men with Russian accents and no identifying insignias had appeared in the village at the weekend of 23–24 August.[347] They set up a roadblock near the village. The men wore distinctive white armbands.[347] The villagers referred to them as ""polite green men"", a term that was used to refer to the irregular Russian forces that took control of Crimea from February 2014. Following the appearance of these men, ten soldiers in green military uniforms with white armbands were detained by Ukrainian forces at Dzerkalne. This village is north of Novoazovosk, 7 kilometres (4+1⁄4 mi) from Kolosky, and about 20 kilometres (12 mi) from the Russian border.[347][348]

The Russian military confirmed that these men were Russian paratroopers and that they had been captured. The Russian Defence Ministry said the men had entered Ukraine ""by mistake during an exercise"".[347][348] The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) released videos that they said were interviews with the captive Russian soldiers. In one of the videos, a soldier said that their commanders had sent them on a 70-kilometre (43+1⁄2 mi) march ""without explaining its purpose or warning that they would be in Ukrainian territory, where they were apprehended by Ukrainian forces and surrendered without a fight"".[349]

Insurgents pushed into Novoazovsk on 27 August.[45][350] Whilst the Ukrainian government said they were in ""total control"" of Novoazovsk, town mayor Oleg Sidorkin confirmed that the insurgents had captured it.[350] He also said that ""dozens"" of tanks and armoured vehicles had been used by the insurgents in their assault on the town. At least four civilians were injured by insurgent shelling. To the north, close to Starobesheve, Ukrainian forces said that they spotted a column of 100 armoured vehicles, tanks, and Grad rocket lorries that was heading south, toward Novoazovsk.[350] They said these vehicles were marked with ""white circles or triangles"", similar to the white armbands seen on the captured Russian paratroopers earlier in the week. Amidst pressure on this new third front, government forces retreated westward toward Mariupol.[45]

They evacuated the town of Starobesheve, among other areas in the 75-kilometre (47 mi) stretch of borderland from the Sea of Azov to the existing insurgent-held territories.[45][351] A report by The New York Times described the retreating soldiers as ""exhausted, filthy and dismayed"".[45] Western officials described the new insurgent actions as a ""stealth invasion"" by the Russian Federation, with tanks, artillery and infantry said to have crossed into Ukraine from Russian territory. US State Department spokesman Jen Psaki said that ""these incursions indicate a Russian-directed counteroffensive is likely underway"", and Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko said ""An invasion of Russian forces has taken place"".[45][352][353] A statement by the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine (NSDC) later said that Novoazovsk had been captured by ""Russian troops"", despite earlier denials by the Ukrainian government.[354]

According to the NSDC, Ukrainian troops withdrew from Novoazovsk to save lives, and were instead preparing defences in Mariupol. Meanwhile, fighting continued in and around Donetsk city. Shells fell on the Kalininskyi district of Donetsk, and the Donbas Battalion continued to fight against the insurgents that had trapped them in Ilovaisk for days.[339][352][355] NATO commander Brig. Gen. Nico Tak said on 28 August that ""well over"" 1,000 Russian soldiers were operating in the Donbas conflict zone.[356] Amidst what The New York Times described as ""chaos"" in the conflict zone, the insurgents re-captured Savur-Mohyla.[45]

Despite these advances by pro-Russian forces, the National Guard of Ukraine temporarily retook the city of Komsomolske in Starobesheve Raion of Donetsk Oblast on 29 August.[357] However, two days later, Ukrainian forces retreated from the city, and Komsomolske was once again taken by the DPR forces.[358] Elsewhere, Ukrainian forces retreated from Novosvitlivka after being attacked by what they said were ""Russian tanks"". They said that every house in the village was destroyed.[359] The trapped Donbas Battalion withdrew from Ilovaisk on 30 August after negotiating an agreement with pro-Russian forces. According to some of the troops who withdrew from Ilovaisk, DPR forces violated the agreement and fired on them whilst they retreated under white flags, killing as many as several dozen.[360]

A Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov was hit by shore-based artillery fire on 31 August.[361] Eight sailors were rescued from the sinking boat, whilst two crew-members were missing. Former insurgent commander Igor Girkin said that the insurgents had ""dealt the enemy their first naval defeat"". Government forces withdrew from Luhansk International Airport on 1 September, despite having held the airport from insurgent attacks for weeks prior.[362] The airport saw fierce fighting on the night before the withdrawal, and Ukrainian officials said that their forces at the airport had been attacked by a column of Russian tanks.[363] Clashes also continued at Donetsk International Airport.[362]

Heavy fighting was observed by OSCE monitors near the villages of Shyrokyne and Bezimenne on 4 September.[364] Respectively, these villages are 24 kilometres (15 mi) and 34 kilometres (21 mi) east of Mariupol. Ukrainian officials in Mariupol said that the situation there ""was worsening by the hour"", and that there was an imminent danger of an attack on the city.[364] DPR forces came within 5 kilometres (3 mi) of the city on 4 September, but their advance was repulsed by an overnight counter-attack launched by the Armed Forces and the Azov Battalion.[365] They were driven back about 20 kilometres (12+1⁄2 mi) east of the city. Constant shelling was heard on the outskirts of Mariupol.[365]

September 2014 ceasefire

After days of peace talks in Minsk under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), Ukraine, Russia, the DPR, and the LPR agreed to a ceasefire on 5 September.[49] OSCE monitors said they would observe the ceasefire, and assist the Ukrainian government in implementing it.[366] According to The New York Times, the agreement was an ""almost verbatim"" replication of Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko's failed June ""15-point peace plan"".[367] It was agreed that there would be an exchange of all prisoners taken by both sides, and that heavy weaponry should be removed from the combat zone.[367][368]

Humanitarian corridors were meant to be maintained so that civilians could leave affected areas. President Poroshenko said that Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts would be granted ""special status"", and that use of the Russian language in these areas would be protected by law.[367][368] Russia started a more robust train and equip operation to strengthen separatists forces.[42] DPR and LPR leaders said that they retained their desire for full independence from Ukraine, despite these concessions. Russian president Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian president Poroshenko discussed the ceasefire on 6 September.[369] Both parties said that they were satisfied with the ceasefire, and that it was generally holding.

The ceasefire was broken multiple times on the night of 6–7 September, and into the day on 7 September.[370][371][372] These violations resulted in the deaths of four Ukrainian soldiers, whilst 29 were injured.[373] Heavy shelling by the insurgents was reported on the eastern outskirts of Mariupol, and OSCE monitors said that the Ukrainian government had fired rockets from Donetsk International Airport. The OSCE said that these breaches of the agreement would not cause the ceasefire to collapse.[372] Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko said on 10 September that ""70% of Russian troops have been moved back across the border"", and also added that this action gave him ""hope that the peace initiatives have good prospects"".[374]

Ceasefire violations continued, however. In line with the Minsk Protocol, OSCE monitors said that they observed a prisoner exchange near Avdiivka at 03:40 on 12 September.[375][376] Ukrainian forces released 31 DPR insurgents, whilst DPR forces released 37 Ukrainian soldiers. OSCE monitors documented violations of the Minsk Protocol in numerous areas of Donetsk Oblast from 13 to 15 September.[377] These areas included Makiivka, Telmanove, Debaltseve, Petrovske, near Mariupol, Yasynuvata, and Donetsk International Airport, all of which saw intense fighting. Two of the armoured vehicles that the monitors were travelling in were struck by shrapnel, rendering one of the vehicles inoperable and forcing the monitors to retreat.[377]

According to the monitors, troop and equipment movements were being carried out by both DPR and Ukrainian forces. They also said that there were ""command and control issues"" amongst both parties to the conflict.[377] A visit by the monitors to Luhansk International Airport took place on 20 September.[378] They said that the airport was ""completely destroyed"", and entirely unusable. Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko said on 21 September that the Armed Forces of Ukraine lost between 60% and 65% of its total active equipment over the course of the war.[379]

Members of the Trilateral Contact Group and the DPR took part in a video conference on 25 September 2014.[380] According to a statement released by the OSCE on the day after the conference, all parties agreed that the fighting had ""subsided in recent days"", and that the ""situation along 70%"" of the buffer zone was ""calm"". They also said that they would ""spare no efforts"" to strengthen the ceasefire.[380] Scattered violations of the ceasefire continued.[381]

In the most significant incident since the start of the ceasefire, seven Ukrainian soldiers died on 29 September when a tank shell struck the armoured personnel carrier that they were travelling in near Donetsk International Airport.[381] A skirmish ensued, leaving many soldiers wounded. Over the next few days, fighting continued around Donetsk International Airport, whilst Donetsk city itself came under heavy shelling.[382][383] Amidst this renewed violence, OSCE chairman Didier Burkhalter issued a statement that ""urged all sides to immediately stop fighting"", and also said that putting the ceasefire at risk of collapse would be ""irresponsible and deplorable"".[384]

According to a report released by the UN Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on 8 October, the ceasefire implemented by the Minsk Protocol was becoming ""increasingly fragile"".[385] The statement that announced the release of the report said that at least 331 people had been killed since the start of ceasefire, and that the most fierce fighting took place around Donetsk International Airport, Debaltseve, and Shchastia.[386] The report said that the majority of civilian deaths were caused by both insurgent and Ukrainian shelling.[387]

Several hundred National Guard troops protested outside the Ukrainian presidential administration building in Kyiv on 13 October.[388] They demanded the end of conscription, and their own demobilisation.[388] According to Kyiv Post, many of the protesters stated that they had clashed with Euromaidan protesters, and that they were not in favour of that movement.[388]

November 2014 separatist elections and aftermath

Heavy fighting continued across the Donbas through October, despite the ceasefire. In violation of the procedure agreed to as part of the Minsk Protocol, DPR and LPR authorities held parliamentary and executive elections on 2 November.[389][390] In response to the elections, Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko asked parliament to revoke the ""special status"" that was granted to DPR and LPR-controlled areas as part of the Minsk Protocol.[391] DPR deputy prime minister Andrei Purgin said that Ukrainian forces had launched ""all-out war"" against the DPR and LPR on 6 November.[392]

Ukrainian officials denied any offensive and said that they would adhere to the Minsk Protocol. Despite this, battles continued across the Donbas, leaving many soldiers dead. Concurrently, separatist representatives requested a redraughting of the Minsk Protocol, as a result of recurrent violations.[392] Intermittent shelling of Donetsk renewed on 5 November.[393] OSCE monitors reported on 8 November that there were large movements of unmarked heavy equipment in separatist-held territory.[394]

These movements included armoured personnel carriers, lorries, petrol tankers, and tanks, which were being manned and escorted by men in dark green uniforms without insignias.[394] Ukrainian government spokesmen said that these were movements of Russian troops, but this could not be independently verified.[395] Overnight into 9 November, intense shelling from both government and insurgent positions rocked Donetsk.[393] OSCE chairman Didier Burkhalter said that he was ""very concerned"" about the ""resurgence of violence"", and stressed the importance of adhering to the Minsk Protocol.[396] OSCE monitors observed more munitions convoys in separatist-held territory on 9 November.[397] These included 17 unmarked green ZiL lorries loaded with ammunition at Sverdlovsk, and 17 similar Kamaz lorries towing howitzers at Zuhres. Another convoy of 43 green military lories, some towing howitzers and rocket launchers, was observed by OSCE monitors in Donetsk on 11 November.[398]

Following the reports of these troop and equipment movements, NATO General Philip Breedlove said on 12 November that he could confirm that Russian troops and heavy equipment had crossed into Ukraine during the preceding week.[399] In response, the Ukrainian Defence Ministry said that it was preparing for a renewed offensive by pro-Russian forces.[400] Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said ""there was and is no evidence"" to support NATO's statement.[399]

By 2 December, at least 1,000 people had died during fighting in the Donbas, since the signing of the Minsk Protocol in early September.[401] A BBC report said that the ceasefire had been ""a fiction"". In light of this continued fighting, Ukrainian and separatist forces agreed to cease all military operations for a ""Day of Silence"" on 9 December.[402][403] Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko said that he hoped that the ""Day of Silence"" would encourage the signing of a new peace deal. Whilst no new peace talks took place following the ""Day of Silence"", fighting between Ukrainian and separatist forces lessened significantly over the course of December.[404][405] A report by the International Crisis Group stated that the late 2014 financial crisis in Russia, in tandem with American and European economic sanctions, deterred further advances by pro-Russian forces.[406] The report also raised concerns about the potential for ""humanitarian catastrophe"" in separatist-controlled Donbas during the cold winter months, saying that the separatists were unable ""to provide basic services for the population"".

In line with the Minsk Protocol, more prisoner exchanges took place during the week of 21–27 December.[407][408] More OSCE-organised talks were held in Minsk during that week, but they reached no result. In a press conference on 29 December, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said that the Minsk Protocol was becoming effective ""point by point"", and also said that ""progress"" was being made.[409] Since the signing of the Protocol, over 1,500 people held by the separatists had been released as part of the prisoner exchanges. Whereas Ukrainian forces had been losing about 100 men per day prior to the Protocol, only about 200 had been killed in the four months since its signing. Poroshenko also said that he believed that conflict would only end if Russian troops were to leave Donbas.[409]

Escalation in January 2015

OSCE monitors reported a ""rise in tensions"" following New Year's Day.[410] Numerous ceasefire violations were recorded, with most occurring near Donetsk International Airport. Infighting amongst insurgent groups broke out in Luhansk Oblast.[411] In one incident, LPR militants said that they had killed Alexander Bednov, the leader of the pro-Russian ""Batman Battalion"", on 2 January 2015. LPR officials said that Bednov had been running an ""illegal prison"", and that he had engaged in torturing prisoners.[412] In another incident, the leader of an Antratsyt-based Don Cossack militant group, Nikolai Kozitsyn, said that the territory controlled by his group, claimed by the Luhansk People's Republic, had become part of the ""Russian empire"", and that Russian president Vladimir Putin was its ""emperor"".[411] An intercity bus stopped at a government checkpoint in Buhas was hit by a Grad rocket on 13 January, killing 12 civilians.[413][414] Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko declared a day of national mourning.[415] Buhas is 35 kilometres (22 mi) south-west of Donetsk city.

The new terminal building at Donetsk International Airport, which had been a site of fighting between Ukrainian and separatist troops since May 2014, was captured by the DPR forces on 15 January.[416] In the days prior to the capturing, the airport was heavily barraged by separatist rocket fire.[417][418] DPR leader Alexander Zakharchenko stated that the capture of the airport was the first step toward regaining territory lost to Ukrainian forces during the middle of 2014. He said ""Let our countrymen hear this: We will not just give up our land. We will either take it back peacefully, or like that"", referring to the capture of the airport.[416]

Such an offensive by separatist forces would signal the complete breakdown of the frequently ignored Minsk Protocol, which established a buffer zone between Ukrainian-controlled and separatist-controlled territories.[419] Ukrainian forces said that there had been ""no order to retreat"" from the airport, and DPR parliament chairman Andrey Purgin said that while DPR forces had gained control of the terminal buildings, fighting was ongoing because ""the Ukrainians have lots of places to hide"".[420] Concurrently, a new round of Minsk talks, scheduled for 16 January by the Trilateral Contact Group on Ukraine, was called off after DPR and LPR leaders Alexander Zakharchenko and Igor Plotnitsky refused to attend.[421]

A government military operation at the weekend of 17–18 January resulted in Ukrainian forces recapturing most of Donetsk International Airport.[422] According to Ukrainian NSDC representative Andriy Lysenko, the operation restored the lines of control established by the Minsk Protocol, and therefore did not constitute a violation of it. The operation caused fighting to move toward Donetsk proper, resulting in heavy shelling of residential areas of the city that border the airport.[422] DPR authorities said that they halted government forces at Putylivskiy bridge, which connects the airport and the city proper.[423] The bridge, which is strategically important, was destroyed during the fighting. OSCE monitors reported that shelling had caused heavy damage in the Donetsk residential districts of Kyivskyi, Kirovskyi, Petrovskyi, and Voroshilovskyi.[424]

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said on 21 January that Russia had deployed more than 9,000 soldiers and 500 tanks, artillery units, and armoured personnel carriers in the Donbas.[425] An article that appeared in The Daily Telegraph said that deployment appeared to be ""a response to Kyiv's success"" in retaining control of Donetsk International Airport.[426] On the same day, Ukrainian forces attempted to surround the airport in an attempt to push back the insurgents.[427]

As Ukrainian and DPR forces fought away from the airport, a group of insurgents stormed the first and third floors of the new terminal building. Ukrainian troops held out on the second floor of the building until the ceiling collapsed, killing several soldiers.[427] The remaining Ukrainian forces were either captured, killed, or were forced to withdraw from the airport, allowing DPR forces to overrun it. According to one volunteer, 37 Ukrainian troops died.[427] The Daily Telegraph called the Ukrainian defeat at the airport ""devastating"".[428]

Following this victory, separatist forces began to attack Ukrainian forces along the line of control in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.[429] Particularly heavy fighting broke out along the Siverskyi Donets River, to the north-west of Luhansk city. Separatist forces captured a Ukrainian checkpoint at Krymske, attacked other checkpoints in the area, and shelled villages near Shchastia.[430]

Separatist forces began an assault on the government-controlled town of Debaltseve in north-eastern Donetsk Oblast, barraging it with artillery fire.[431] The DPR launched an attack on Mariupol from Shyrokyne during the morning of 24 January. A hail of Grad rockets killed at least 30 people, and wounded another 83.[432][433] Heavy fighting continued in Debaltseve over the next week, resulting in many civilian and combatant casualties.[434]

French president François Hollande and German chancellor Angela Merkel put forth a new peace plan on 7 February. The Franco-German plan, drawn up after talks with Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko and Russian president Vladimir Putin, was seen as a revival of the Minsk Protocol. President Hollande said that the plan was the ""last chance"" for resolution of the conflict.[435][436] The plan was put forth in response to American proposals to send armaments to the Ukrainian government, something that Chancellor Merkel said would only result in a worsening of the crisis.[435][437]

Fighting worsened in the run-up to the scheduled 11 February talks to discuss the Franco-German peace plan. DPR forces shelled the city of Kramatorsk on 10 February, which had last seen fighting in July 2014. The shelling targeted the city's Armed Forces headquarters, but also hit a nearby residential area. Seven people were killed, while 26 were wounded.[438] The pro-government Azov Battalion launched an offensive to recapture separatist-controlled areas on the outskirts of Mariupol, centred on the village of Shyrokyne. Battalion commander Andriy Biletsky said his forces were moving toward Novoazovsk.[438]

In October 2015 a member of the monitoring mission Maksim Udovichenko, delegated to OSCE by Russia, was suspended for ""misbehavior"" involving alcohol while in Severodonetsk and admitted he is actually a GRU officer.[439]

Minsk II ceasefire and denouement

The withdrawal of Ukrainian heavy weaponry, March 2015

The scheduled summit at Minsk on 11 February 2015 resulted in the signing of a new package of peacemaking measures, called Minsk II, on 12 February.[440] The plan, similar in content to the failed Minsk Protocol, called for an unconditional ceasefire, to begin on 15 February, amongst many other measures.[440][441] Despite the signing of Minsk II, fighting continued around Debaltseve.[442] DPR forces said that ceasefire did not apply to Debaltseve, and continued their offensive. Ukrainian forces were forced to withdraw from the Debaltseve area on 18 February, leaving separatist forces in control of it.[443]

In the week after the fall of Debaltseve to pro-Russian forces, fighting in the conflict zone abated.[444] DPR and LPR forces began to withdraw artillery from the front lines as specified by Minsk II on 24 February, and Ukraine did so on 26 February. Ukraine reported that it had suffered no casualties during 24–26 February, something that had not occurred since early January 2015.[444][445]

Minor skirmishes continued into March, but the ceasefire was largely observed across the combat zone. Ukrainian and separatist forces had withdrawn most of the heavy weaponry specified in Minsk II by 10 March.[446] Minor violations of the ceasefire continued throughout March and into April, though it continued to hold, and the numbers of casualties reported by both sides were greatly reduced.[447][448][449] Fighting flared up on 3 June 2015, when DPR insurgents launched an attack on government-controlled Marinka. Artillery and tanks were utilised in the battle there, which was described as the heaviest fighting since the signing of Minsk II.[450]

An anti-war protest took place in Donetsk city on 15 June.[451][452] The protest, the first of its kind in pro-Russian separatist-controlled territory, called for an end to the fighting in the Donbas. About 500 people, who had gathered outside the RSA building, shouted, ""Stop the war!"", ""Give us back our houses, our homes are broken!"", and ""Get out of here!"" Specifically, protesters demanded that the separatists cease firing rocket attacks from residential areas on the outskirts of Donetsk.[451][453]

Whilst all parties to the conflict continued to support implementation of the measures specified by Minsk II, minor skirmishes continued on a daily basis through June and July 2015. Ukrainian troops suffered losses on a daily basis, and the ceasefire was labelled ""unworkable"" and ""impossible to implement"". Despite constant fighting and shelling along the line of contact, no territorial changes occurred.[454] This state of stalemate led the war to be labelled a ""frozen conflict"".[51]

Following months of ceasefire violations, the Ukrainian government, the DPR and the LPR jointly agreed to halt all fighting, starting on 1 September 2015. This agreement coincided with the start of the school year in Ukraine, and was intended to allow for another attempt at implementing the points of Minsk II.[455] By 12 September, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said that the ceasefire had been holding, and that the parties to the conflict were ""very close"" to reaching an agreement to withdraw heavy weaponry from the line of contact, as specified by Minsk II. The area around Mariupol, including Shyrokyne, saw no fighting. According to Ukrainian Defence Minister Stepan Poltorak, violence in the Donbas had reached its lowest level since the start of the war.[456]

Whilst the ceasefire continued to hold into November, no final settlement to the conflict was agreed. The New York Times described this result as part of ""a common arc of post-Soviet conflict, visible in the Georgian enclaves of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan and in Transnistria"", and said that separatist-controlled areas had become a ""frozen zone"", where people ""live in ruins, amid a ruined ideology, in the ruins of the old empire.""[457] This state of affairs continued into 2016, with a 15 April report by the BBC labelling the conflict as ""Europe's forgotten war"".[458] Minor outbreaks of fighting continued along the line of contact, though no major territorial changes occurred.[458]

A new ceasefire came into effect on 1 September 2016, described at the time by BBC correspondent Tom Burridge as ""the first time there has been a true halt to fighting in 11 months"", and in 2018 described by TASS as the most successful ceasefire over the course of the conflict.[459][60] Within days both sides accused each other of breaching the ceasefire, although they also stated that the ceasefire was widely observed.[460] Nevertheless, on 6 September (2016), Ukrainian authorities reported the death of yet another soldier.[461] On 24 December 2016, the tenth indefinite ceasefire since the start of the conflict came into effect; according to the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, the Ukrainian government, and the separatists, the ceasefire was not observed.[462]

2016 was the first full calendar year of the conflict in which Ukraine lost no territories to pro-Russian forces.[463] In addition, both the Ukrainian Armed Forces (211 combat losses and 256 non-combat losses) and the local populace (13 in Ukrainian government-controlled areas) suffered many fewer casualties than in 2015.[463] The new year, however, brought a new eruption of heavy fighting, starting on 29 January 2017, centred on the Ukrainian-controlled city of Avdiivka.[464]

On 18 February 2017, Russian president Vladimir Putin signed a decree whereby the Russian authorities would recognise personal and vehicle-registration documents issued by the DPR and LPR.[465] The presidential decree referred to ""permanent residents of certain areas of Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts"", without any mention of the self-proclaimed People's Republics.[466] Ukrainian authorities decried the decree as being directly contradictory to the Minsk II agreement and that it ""legally recognised the quasi-state terrorist groups which cover Russia's occupation of part of Donbas.""[467] Secretary General of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Lamberto Zannier stated on 19 February the decree ""implies...recognition of those who issue the documents, of course"" and that it would make it more diffi",https://wiki2.org/en/War_in_Donbass
