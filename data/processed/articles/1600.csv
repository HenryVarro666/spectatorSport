This is a dangerous moment for Europe and for freedom-loving people around the world. By launching a premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified attack on the people of Ukraine, Vladimir Putin has also committed an assault on the principles that uphold global peace and democracy. Of these principles, one of the most fundamental is the right of every state to set its own course and choose its own alliances. President Putin, facilitated in his efforts by the Lukashenko regime in Belarus, seeks to strip the Ukrainian people of this right through the use of force. Montenegro has a deep stake in this conflict because its security will be impacted if Putin continues his campaign to undermine European security.

The United States has urged Russia to stop its war of aggression against Ukraine and choose the path of diplomacy. But as long as President Putin continues his war of choice against Ukraine, the United States, together with our Allies and partners across the globe, will continue to support the Ukrainian people as they defend their country with bravery that is inspiring the world. As a result of unprecedented global sanctions coordination, the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Japan, and Canada have removed selected Russian banks from the SWIFT messaging system and imposed restrictive measures on the Russian Central Bank. President Biden announced sweeping financial sanctions and stringent export controls that will damage both Russia’s and Belarus’ economy, financial system, and access to technology, and thus undercut their ability to wage war.

We praise Montenegro for joining tough EU sanctions, providing humanitarian and security assistance, and for closing its airspace to Russian aircraft. Montenegro is also standing strong with Ukraine, expressing its solidarity and condemning Moscow’s aggression in various international fora. At the same time, we look to all political and civil society leaders in Montenegro, an important NATO Ally, to unequivocally denounce Putin’s war of choice in Ukraine. This is a civilizational issue, a choice between freedom and oppression.

In addition to economic penalties, the Biden Administration has committed $1 billion in security assistance to Ukraine in the past year to help the brave people of Ukraine defend their country. The United States stands ready to defend every inch of NATO territory and NATO Allies have also added their own forces and capabilities to ensure our collective defense and contribute to NATO’s Rapid Response Force to bolster our shared security on the Eastern Flank.

Vladimir Putin planned his brutal attack on the people of Ukraine for a long time. He rejected every good-faith effort by the United States and our Allies and partners to address his fabricated security concerns and to avoid needless conflict and human suffering by engaging in diplomacy and dialogue. We declassified our intelligence about Russia’s plans so there could be no confusion and no cover up. President Putin chose this war.

The people of the Western Balkans know all too well the consequences of conflict. We must not let Russia use its war of choice to hold back the progress of the countries of this region. Russia is not looking out for your best interests. Montenegro’s future is in Europe as a full-fledged member of the European Union. To that end, it is imperative that Montenegrin political leaders take needed steps to unblock key institutions, such as Parliament, at this critical moment for Europe’s future – not only to ensure Montenegro can fulfill its NATO commitments to mutual self-defense, but also to speed its progress in the EU accession process.

In the face of one of the most significant challenges to European security and democratic ideals since World War II, the United States and our Allies and partners have joined together in solidarity. President Putin has failed to undermine our shared belief in the fundamental right of sovereign nations to choose their destiny and their allies. And President Putin will fail to erase the proud nation of Ukraine.

By launching his brutal assault on the people of Ukraine, Vladimir Putin has also committed an assault on the principles that uphold global peace and democracy. But the people of Ukraine are resilient and we will continue to support the Ukrainian people as they defend their country. By choosing to pay for a war instead of investing in the needs of Russians, Putin’s invasion of Ukraine will be a strategic failure for the Kremlin and ravage the future of the Russian people.

The world is taking action to hold Russia accountable. As a result of unprecedented global sanctions coordination, Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and Japan have removed selected Russian banks from the SWIFT messaging system and imposed restrictive measures on the Russian Central Bank. After Putin began his invasion, the ruble hit its weakest point in history, and the Russian stock market plunged. Severe sanctions have been imposed on the architects of this war, including Putin himself. We recognize and applaud Guatemala’s early and strong support and leadership in ensuring the international community holds Russia accountable in multilateral fora, including the Government of Guatemala co-sponsoring resolutions in the UN General Assembly and the Organization of American States.

In response to Putin’s war of choice, the vast majority of countries have stood by Ukraine and its people, and countries continue to support them economically, politically and defensively. Measures have been implemented to welcome Ukrainians who have fled the armed conflict and huge humanitarian aid programs and mechanisms have been launched to reduce the suffering of the displaced. Russia’s ability to do business using the international banking system has been restricted, stunting Russia’s ability to finance and grow its military. And we are prepared to do more.

Russia is advancing an invasion of disinformation based on lie, it is therefore of the utmost importance that we remain vigilant against the proliferation of disinformation.

This was an attack that Vladimir Putin has planned for a long time. He methodically moved more than 150,000 troops and military equipment to Ukraine’s border. He moved blood supplies into position and built field hospitals, demonstrating his intentions all along. He rejected every good-faith effort to address his fabricated security concerns and to avoid needless conflict and human suffering by engaging in diplomacy and dialogue.

Russia continues to justify its military aggression by falsely claiming the need to stop “genocide” in Ukraine – despite there being no evidence that genocide was occurring there. We saw Russia use these tactics before when they invaded Ukraine in 2014 and Georgia in 2008.

At almost the very same moment the United Nations Security Council was meeting to stand up for Ukraine’s sovereignty and forestall disaster, Putin launched his invasion in violation of international law. Missiles began to rain down, striking historic cities across Ukraine. Then came air raids, columns of tanks, and battalions of troops, all riding a renewed wave of disinformation and outright lies.

Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war. And now his people will bear the consequences of his decision to invest in war rather than in them.

Putin’s goal of dividing the international community has failed. In the face one of the most significant challenges to democratic ideals since World War II, we have joined together in solidarity. We have united, coordinating intensively to engage as one with Russia and Ukraine, to provide assistance to Ukraine and develop a broad and massive response.

Putin has failed to divide us. Putin has failed to undermine our shared belief in the fundamental right of sovereign nations to choose their destiny and their allies. And Putin will fail to erase the proud nation of Ukraine.

Putin’s aggression against Ukraine will cost Russia profoundly, both economically and strategically. The Russian people deserve better from their government than the immense cost to their future that this invasion has precipitated.

Liberty, democracy, and human dignity are forces far more powerful than fear and oppression. In the contest between democracy and autocracy, between sovereignty and subjugation, make no mistake: Freedom will prevail.

Deutsche Bank 'winding down' operations in Russia

Following a backlash, Germany's biggest lender Deutsche Bank said it would wind down its business in Russia.

""Like some international peers and in line with our legal and regulatory obligations, we are in the process of winding down our remaining business in Russia while we help our non-Russian multinational clients in reducing their operations,"" the bank said on Friday.

""There won't be any new business in Russia.""

Deutsche Bank had faced stinging criticism from some investors and politicians for its ongoing ties to Russia. It had said leaving would go against its values, despite other banks cutting off ties.

UK intelligence: Russian strikes targeted Lutsk, Ivano-Frankivsk

The British Ministry of Defence said Russian air and missile forces had conducted strikes in the past 24 hours against the cities of Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk in western Ukraine.

Lutsk Mayor Ihor Polishchuk said four servicemen were killed and another six were wounded.

US accuses Russia of using UN Security Council for 'disinformation'

US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Russia had requested a UN Security Council meeting to spread ""disinformation"" as part of a potential false-flag operation by Moscow for the use of chemical or biological agents in Ukraine.

Thomas-Greenfield said US Secretary of State Antony Blinken had warned that President Putin would ""fabricate allegations about chemical or biological weapons to justify its own violent attacks against the Ukrainian people.""

""The intent behind these lies seems clear, and is deeply troubling,"" she said. ""We believe Russia could use chemical or biological agents for assassinations, as part of a staged or false-flag incident, or to support tactical military operations.""

Russia's UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said Moscow had documents claiming that Ukraine has at least 30 biological laboratories carrying out ""very dangerous biological experiments"" involving pathogens, and its work ""is being done and funded and supervised by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency of the United States.""

US announces new sanctions against Kremlin elites, oligarchs

The US Department of Treasury imposed new sanctions on senior Kremlin officials and oligarchs, as well as their family members.

Those hit with sanctions include 10 people comprising VTB Bank's board and 12 members of the Duma.

""[The Department of] Treasury continues to hold Russian officials to account for enabling Putin's unjustified and unprovoked war,"" Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said in a statement.

""Today's actions also further isolates the severely damaged Russian economy by prohibiting trade in products that are key to the economic and financial interests of all Russian elites.""

Among the individuals targeted are three family members of Kremlin spokesman Dimitry Peskov, who the US name as ""the lead propagandist"" of Russia.

Separately, the US also announced sanctions against two Russian individuals and three entities over their support for North Korea's weapons program.

Ukraine says Russian forces abducted mayor of occupied city

According to Ukraine's Foreign Ministry, Russian forces have abducted the mayor of the city of Melitopol.

An unverified video posted on social media shows Mayor Ivan Fedorov being led away by armed men from a government building in the city.

Melitopol, a city in southeastern Ukraine, has been occupied for more than a week. Fedorov's fate is unknown.

""The abduction of the mayor of Melitopol is classified as a war crime under the Geneva Conventions and the Additional Protocol, which prohibit the taking of civilian hostages during the war,"" Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

Amnesty says its Russian website blocked, RSF says it has a workaround

Amnesty International's Russian-language website is among those blocked by country's media regulator, Roskomnadzor, it emerged on Friday.

""By blocking Amnesty's Russian-language site, along with those of many other human rights organizations, independent media outlets and social media platforms, the Kremlin is showing that it can't stomach the truth about the horror Russia has unleashed in Ukraine,"" Marie Struthers, Amnesty's Eastern Europe and Central Asia Director, said.

Amnesty said Russia was trying to ""suppress information about the possible war crimes its troops are committing in Ukraine"" with the shutdown.

Meanwhile, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said hackers and other specialists had created a mirror site for the Russian independent news website, Meduza, that Russia can't easily block.

The site is run out of Latvia by exiled Russian journalists.

RSF said it could do the same thing for other independent media outlets that Russia was blocking.

""Without strong action, the Russian Internet will soon complete its transformation into a propaganda network,"" RSF secretary-general Christophe Deloire said.

Europe to implement the fourth round of sanctions against Russia

The EU has joined the United States in revoking Russia's ""most-favored nation"" trade status. The World Trade Organization term is a little misleading, as almost all WTO members trade with each other under ""most-favored nation"" status.

The move would put Russia on par with North Korea and Iran.

""We will also work to suspend Russia's membership rights in leading multilateral financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said.

It is part of the fourth set of sanctions the bloc is implementing against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.

Other measures include a crackdown on Moscow's use of crypto-assets, a ban on exports of luxury goods to Russia, and preventing imports of iron and steel sector goods to the EU.

""This crisis is unprecedented. And so is the unity and speed of reaction our democracies have shown so far,"" von der Leyen said.

ICC opens online portal to gather war crime evidence

The International Criminal Court warned warring parties in Ukraine that attacks on civilians are a crime.

""If attacks are intentionally directed against the civilian population: that is a crime. If attacks are intentionally directed against civilian objects: that is a crime,"" ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan said in statement.

The court last week opened an investigation into the situation in Ukraine.

On Friday, it launched an online portal to gather evidence of war crimes.

""I encourage all those with relevant information to come forward and contact our Team through this platform,"" Kahn said.

It will be added to evidence gathered by an investigative team sent to the region last week.

Neither Russia nor Ukraine is a fully-fledged ICC member state.

UN Security Council session opens amid reciprocal 'false flag' allegations

A special session of the UN Security Council has opened, called by Russia, about Moscow's claims that US-backed laboratories in Ukraine were working on biological weapons and planning a ""false flag"" attack.

""There is no region in the world that can feel safe,"" Russia's Ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzya, said.

The UN's disarmament chief, Izumi Nakamitsu, however, told the council that the UN body was not aware of any biological weapons program in Ukraine.

The US in turn accused Russia of planning a biological or chemical weapons attack of its own that it would then seek to blame on the other side. It also said Russia was abusing the UN Security Council by using it as a vehicle to spread disinformation.

US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield went even further, saying ""Russia has a track record of falsely accusing other countries of the very violations that Russia itself is perpetrating.""

""We have serious concerns that Russia may be planning to use chemical or biological agents against the Ukrainian people,"" she said, without providing evidence.

Russian siege of Mariupol kills almost 1,600 civilians: local council

At least 1,582 civilians have been killed in Ukraine's southeastern city of Mariupol as a result of Russian shelling and a 12-day blockade, the city council said in an online statement, also saying: ""We will never forget and will never forgive this crime against humanity.""

Russia's Defense Ministry on Friday said that its offensive, led by fighters from the separatist-held Donetsk region, was further squeezing Mariupol, which lies on the Sea of Azov that runs into the Black Sea.

Repeated attempts over the past week to evacuate many of the city's 430,000 residents and deliver food and medicine have failed owing to violations of temporary cease-fires and other complications.

Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, described Mariupol as the ""worst humanitarian catastrophe on the planet."" He posted a picture showing a mass grave in the city on Twitter.

Residents have been sheltering underground without power, heat, water and enough food for several days and the Red Cross has described the situation as ""apocalyptic.""

There are growing concerns that Russia may repeat the same strategy of laying siege to Ukrainian cities as used in Syria.

Macron: Ukraine conflict threatens food security in Europe, Africa

French President Emmanuel Macron has warned that the war in Ukraine could ""deeply destabilize"" food supplies in Europe and Africa.

Speaking to reporters after the EU leaders' meeting near Paris, he warned that some of the world's most fertile agricultural land in Ukraine can't be planted right now because of Russia's invasion.

Macron's comments backed up a warning from the United Nations on Friday that millions of people could be threatened with malnutrition by next year if there are major cuts in the export of grain from major producers Ukraine and Russia.

The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimated that the number of undernourished people worldwide could rise by 8 million to 13 million by 2023 if the conflict in Ukraine continues for months.

Prices for wheat and corn, among other grains, have already risen sharply on world markets and Ukrainian farmers — who produced a record grain crop last year — say they are now short of fertilizer, pesticides and herbicides, and can't get enough fuel to power their equipment.

In a television address on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on farmers to keep up production to try to avoid shortages of produce.

The issue isn't limited to Ukraine, either. Farmers elsewhere are concerned about drastically higher prices for nitrogen fertilizer, the production of which requires natural gas.

Zelenskyy says Ukraine is fighting for more countries than itself

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy got a standing ovation from the Polish National Assembly. He spoke to the assembly via video link at an event marking the 23rd anniversary of Poland joining NATO.

Zelenskyy thanked Poland for its military support and for hosting Ukrainian refugees fleeing the Russian attacks, ""when there is someone that is brutal in its attack, you need someone you can count on.""

""We are fighting for the Baltic states and for Poland so that they don't have to face [Russia],"" he said.

At the same event, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance has more than doubled the number of troops and military equipment deployed in Poland, adding ""we will protect Poland.""

He again stressed Russia could not dictate who joins NATO.

""Neither Russia nor anyone else has a veto whether any country becomes a member,"" Stoltenberg said.

Polish President Andrzej Duda said it was essential to support Ukraine against Russia.

""What Russia is doing in Ukraine shows it is still the empire of evil,"" Duda said. ""We cannot allow Russia to overpower the free and independent Ukraine.""

Biden to revoke Russia's 'most favored nation' trade status

US President Joe Biden said Washington would revoke Russia's ""most favored nation"" trade status over its invasion of Ukraine. The phrase used by the World Trade Organization (WTO) is somewhat misleading, as it means countries reciprocally agree to trade with each other on the same terms as they do with other ""most favored nations."" The US extends this status to all countries in the WTO except those who have had the status suspended, as do most members.

In the US, this trade status is in fact referred to as ""Permanent Normal Trade Relations"" (PNTR). Removing it would require an act of Congress, but lawmakers in both houses — and on both sides of the political aisle — have already signaled their support.

The European Union and Group of Seven wealthy nations (G7) are expected to follow suit.

Biden said the United States would also cut imports of seafood, vodka and diamonds from Russia and would work with its international partners to stop Moscow to taking loans from global institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

Again ruling out any direct US military intervention in Ukraine, Biden said broadening the conflict to a clash between NATO and Russia could lead to ""World War III.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Twitter that he had spoken to Biden earlier Friday and had informed him about the “crimes of Russia against the civilian population."" He added that the pair had ""agreed on further steps to support the defense of Ukraine and increase sanctions against Russia.""

Russia carries out first air strikes on western Ukraine

Russia has widened its offensive in Ukraine, striking airfields in the west for the first time.

Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said Moscow used high-precision long-range weapons to put military airfields in Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk ""out of action.""

Russian air strikes also targeted for the first time the eastern city of Dnipro, a major industrial hub and Ukraine's fourth-largest city, on the river of the same name.

Until now, Russian forces have made the biggest advances on cities in the south and east while stalling in the north and around Kyiv.

But the advance had appeared to stall amid reports of food and fuel shortages and attacks by Ukrainian troops with anti-tank missiles.

New satellite photos also appeared to show the massive Russian convoy outside the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, had fanned out.

A 40-mile (64-kilometer) line of tanks and other vehicles had massed outside the city early last week. The Russian military is widely expected to try to encircle Kyiv.

Europe to double military aid for Ukraine

Europe has earmarked another €500 million ($550 million) for military aid to Ukraine, the President of the European Council Charles Michel said.

He spoke at the end of the meeting of EU leaders at Versailles in France.

The money will be on top of the €500 million the EU has already committed to support Ukraine.

At the same event, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Europe would impose a fourth round of sanctions on Russia and President Vladimir Putin soon.

She also said Ukraine's application for EU membership was being considered favorably, adding that the country is already ""a member of the European family.""

""Ukraine's membership application is an expression of their will and their right to choose their own destiny. Today we have opened the pathway towards us for Ukraine,"" she added.

French President Emmanuel Macron said the EU would hold an extraordinary summit by May to discuss joint defense investments in the block.

He said the EU wants to stop importing Russian gas, oil and coal by 2027.

""There have to be new investments and new facilities so that we can support our choices for renewables and nuclear energy,"" Macron said.

Macron said he and Scholz will speak again to Putin ""in a few hours.""

Scholz: Cutting Europe's reliance on Russian energy will take time

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz says Europe is working to reduce its reliance on Russian oil and gas in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But he acknowledged that it would take some time.

""Our situation is much different than the US or Canada, who are much less dependent on Russian oil and gas, because they are net exporters,"" Scholz told a news conference following a summit of EU leaders at Versailles in France on Friday.

""What they are doing, they know that Europe cannot do in the undertake in the same way"" he added, referring to the ban on Russian energy by the US and Canada.

One idea, he said, was to link up electricity and gas networks across Europe to be more efficient.

The German leader also said the Western sanctions on Moscow had been ""massive"" and were already having ""dramatic consequences"" on the Russian economy.

Scholz said the Western countries had shown a ""strong will to stand together, to stand shoulder to shoulder in managing this crisis.""

He added that other EU leaders had welcomed Berlin's decision to drastically hike military spending.

EU summit at Versailles wrapping up

The leaders of EU member states have concluded an informal summit held at France's Versailles Palace with talks centering around the situation in Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz are among the participants.

There has been strong support of Ukraine's resistance to Russia's invasion.

However, some have stressed that there is no shortcut to EU membership, which Ukraine is seeking as a matter of urgency. Former eastern bloc countries however believe there needs to be a stronger signal towards membership.

Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich hit with fresh sanctions, from Canada

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Friday that his country had imposed sanctions on Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich and four other oligarchs.

""These individuals will be prevented from dealings in Canada and their assets will be frozen,"" Trudeau told reporters in Warsaw.

He added that 32 Russian companies and government entities would be barred from receiving defense equipment or supplies from Canada.

However, the Canadian operations of Russian steelmaker Evraz, of which Abramovich is the largest shareholder, will not be affected by the move.

On Thursday, Abramovich — who owns Chelsea Football Club — was included in fresh UK sanctions against Russian individuals.

The football club is among the assets frozen and his planned sale of the club has been stalled.

Kremlin: Russian peace demands handed to Ukraine

Russia said Friday that its concrete demands for ceasing hostilities in Ukraine had been handed over to Kyiv.

The Interfax news agency cited Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that the demands were related to the advance of NATO infrastructure on Russia's western borders and Ukraine's actions in the southeastern Donbas region.

""For the resolution of these two issues, the concrete demands formulated by the Russian side were handed over to the Ukrainian side. As far as we know, the Ukrainians are discussing these demands with their advisers, primarily from the US and EU countries,"" Peskov said.

He added that a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy had not been ruled out.

""But first, both delegations and ministers must do their part to ensure that the presidents meet not for the sake of the process, not for the sake of talking, but for the sake of the result,"" Peskov said.

NATO chief: War must not escalate beyond Ukraine's borders

Russia's invasion of Ukraine must not spill over into an open conflict between NATO and Moscow, the military alliance's chief Jens Stoltenberg said.

""We have a responsibility to prevent this conflict from escalating beyond Ukraine's borders to becoming a full-fledged war between Russia and NATO,"" he told AFP news agency on the sidelines of a forum in Turkey.

Kyiv has strongly criticized NATO's refusal to declare a no-fly zone over Ukraine to stop Russian missiles and warplanes.

Last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the Western military alliance ruled out the measure despite knowing that further Russian aggression was likely.

In his interview with AFP, Stoltenberg warned that a no-fly zone would ""most likely lead to a full war,"" causing ""so much more suffering, so much more death and destruction.""

Moscow threatens Facebook over posts for calling for 'murder' of Russians

Russia said on Friday it would shut down Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp if the platforms allowed users to call for violence against Russians and death to President Vladimir Putin.

Internal emails seen by Reuters news agency showed Facebook's parent company Meta had temporarily allowed posts that call for the death of Putin or Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko.

A Meta spokesperson confirmed it had eased its rules, allowing posts such as ""death to the Russian invaders,"" although it would not allow calls for violence against Russian civilians.

Russia's Investigative Committee, which probes major crimes, said it was launching a criminal case into the report.

Russia's General Prosecutor's Office also requested that the internet giant be branded ""extremist.""

Zelenskyy: 'Strategic turning point' in war with Russia

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country has reached a strategic turning point in its war with Russia.

But he cautioned that time and patience were still needed until victory is achieved.

""It is impossible to say how many days we still have to free Ukrainian land,"" he said in a televised address. ""But we can say we will do it.""

Zelenskyy also urged the international community to step up their sanctions on Moscow.

UN: Credible reports of Russian use of cluster bombs

The United Nations human rights office said on Friday it had received ""credible reports"" of several cases of Russian forces using cluster bombs in Ukraine.

The munitions are made up of a hollow shell that explodes in mid-air, dispersing dozens or even hundreds of smaller ""bomblets"" over a wide area.

UNHCR spokesperson Liz Throssell said the use of cluster bombs in populated areas is ""incompatible with the international humanitarian law principles governing the conduct of hostilities.""

""We remind the Russian authorities that directing attacks against civilians and civilian objects, as well as so-called area bombardment in towns and villages and other forms of indiscriminate attacks, are prohibited under international law and may amount to war crimes.""

The UNHRC said it had confirmed at least 549 civilian deaths in Ukraine and 57 injuries since the Russian invasion began on February 24, although experts say the real figure is likely higher.

Russia is not a party to a 2008 convention banning cluster bombs, but the country is bound by international humanitarian law.

Minister proposes evacuating wounded to Germany

Germany should play a leading role in providing medical care for the victims of the war in Ukraine, Health Minister Karl Lauterbach said Friday.

""Wounded, injured people can be brought to Germany with the help of the International Red Cross and then be distributed throughout the country, he said.

Lauterbach said Germany can also deliver medicines and medical supplies to Ukraine, via Poland.

He also hailed reports that several German nurses and doctors have volunteered to work in Ukraine, describing their decision as a ""heroic effort.""

'Positive shifts' in Russia-Ukraine talks, Putin says

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday there had been some progress in talks with Ukraine, but provided no details.

""There are certain positive shifts, negotiators on our side tell me,"" Putin said in a meeting with his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko, adding that talks continued ""practically on a daily basis.""

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba had said Thursday the meeting in Turkey with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, did not bring any decisive progress.

Kuleba said they couldn't agree on the creation of humanitarian corridors for the port city of Mariupol, but that Lavrov would confer with colleagues in Moscow on the issue.

Interior Ministry: Most extremists fighters have returned to Germany

Most of the far-right extremists who left Germany to help Ukraine fight against Russia have returned, an Interior Ministry spokesperson said Friday.

The update followed a report by Bild newspaper last week that nearly 1,000 foreign fighters from Germany had traveled to Ukraine to join the international legion to fight the invasion. Among them were members of neo-Nazi groups, the report said.

Ukrainian President Zelenskyy had called on Ukrainians abroad or other interested parties to come to and help his country fight Russia.

The Interior Ministry spokesperson reiterated an earlier statement that the number was in the single digits, adding that Berlin authorities were able to stop others from leaving.

In Germany, there have been a small number of anti-Russian and anti-Ukrainian incidents. The ministry is monitoring the situation, added the spokesperson.

EU plans to double military aid financing to Ukraine

The European Union is proposing to spend an extra €500 million ($549 million) to finance military aid to Ukraine, the bloc's foreign policy chief said.

Josep Borrell said he was ""certain"" EU leaders meeting in France for a second day on Friday would agree to double the spending package that has seen the bloc fund weapons going to Ukraine.

The bloc last month broke a long-standing taboo by agreeingto pay for arms deliveries to Ukraine after Russia invaded its neighbor to the West.

The move by Brussels was part of a broad push by Ukraine's allies to send weapons after pleas from Kyiv to help it fight off the Kremlin's advancing forces.

Officials said the new tranche of money would go towards reimbursing EU nations that were unilaterally sending arms requested by Ukraine.

1 million without power in Ukraine: energy firm

Nearly a million people in Ukraine are without electricity, the country's state-owned nuclear energy provider Energoatom said on Friday, as Russia's bombardment of Ukrainian cities continued.

It added that nearly 228,000 consumers were without natural gas.

Other reports have said the port city of Mariupol, where authorities have tried repeatedly to evacuate civilians, has been without food, running water and electricity for 10 days.

Nighttime temperatures in Ukraine regularly fall below freezing and daytime temperatures hover around 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit).

Deutsche Bank maintains operations in Russia

Deutsche Bank has been criticized for not joining other Western companies in leaving Russia following the invasion of Ukraine.

Bill Browder, an investor campaigning to expose corruption, said by continuing to do business in Russia, Germany's biggest bank ""is completely at odds with the international business community and will create backlash, lost reputation and business in the West.""

Ana Botin, president of the European Banking Federation, told Spain's El Mundo newspaper, ""Most European banks are applying the strictest sanctions and even going further, trying to do what is right and what needs to be done.""

Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing on Thursday defended the decision in a note to staff, saying leaving Russia would “go against our values.""

He added that it would not ""be the right thing to do in terms of managing those client relationships and helping them to manage their situation.""

Deutsche Bank said earlier this week its credit risk exposure to Russia and Ukraine was €2.9 billion ($3.18 billion) and that it had reduced its Russia exposure further over the past two weeks.

Two German public broadcasters resume operations in Moscow

A week after they announced they would suspend operations in Russia, German public broadcasters ARD and ZDF have said they will resume broadcasts from Moscow.

The broadcasters said they will report on the ""political, economic and social situation in Russia,"" WDR, a member of the ARD network, said.

The decision to halt broadcasting came after the Russian State Duma passed a law criminalizing ""false reporting"" of its armed forces with up to 15 years in jail

Unlike Deutsche Welle, which is also a public broadcaster, the two other German networks' journalists did not have their press accreditation revoked by Russian authorities.

Litvinenko's widow: West must counter Putin's 'brainwashing'

The West must step up its battle against the Kremlin's disinformation campaign, Marina Litvinenko, the widow of the poisoned Russian spy and Putin critic Alexander Litvinenko, told DW.

She said the Russian people have been ""completely brainwashed"" over the past 20 years and most independent media outlets have been shut down.

Litvinenko said Western countries — including Germany — who used to beam Russian language broadcasts into the Soviet Union, were partly responsible for allowing Russian President Vladimir Putin to spread disinformation when they cut their services after the end of the Cold War.

""It was a huge mistake because the people behind this war have been waiting for revenge. When this all proper [truthful] information left Russia, it was ... [replaced] by disinformation, by brainwashing,"" she added.

UN: 4.5 million displaced by Russian invasion

The International Organization for Migration (IOM) says 2.5 million people have now fled Ukraine since Russia invaded 15 days ago.

IOM spokesman Paul Dillon said the figures, taken from national governments, were up to date until Friday morning (GMT).

Dillon said more than 1.5 million refugees have gone to Poland and that around 116,000 of those who've fled Ukraine are ""third-country nationals,"" not Ukrainians.

The UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, also gave the 2.5 million figure for refugees and said his agency estimates that about 2 million people are also displaced inside Ukraine.

Putin calls on 'volunteers' to join Russia's offensive

Russian President Vladimir Putin has backed plans to let volunteers from countries fight in Ukraine as the conflict there enters its third week.

Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Russia knew of ""more than 16,000 applications"" from the Middle East, many of them from people who he said helped Russia against the ""Islamic State"" group, according to a Kremlin transcript.

They want ""to take part in what they consider a liberation movement,"" Shoigu said, on the side of Russia-backed separatist regions in eastern Ukraine.

Scholars have cast doubt on the Kremlin's motives, particularly the notion that Moscow maintains it is liberating Ukraine. University of Rochester's associate professor of history Matthew Lenoe called Russia's invasion of its neighbor ""a brutal act of aggression with absolutely no justification.""

Navalny repeats protest call to stop 'maniac Putin'

Jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny called for anti-war protests to take place across Russia on Sunday.

""Mad maniac Putin will most quickly be stopped by the people of Russia now if they oppose the war,"" Navalny posted on Instagram.

""You need to go to anti-war rallies every weekend, even if it seems that everyone has either left or got scared,"" he said. ""You are the backbone of the movement against war and death.""

Potential Chelsea buyers must approach UK government

Anyone interested in buying Premier League soccer club Chelsea must first approach the UK government and make a proposal.

The British government sanctioned owner Roman Abramovich and halted his planned sale of the club, as well as a raft of restrictions on the club, such as limits on travel expenditure and an inability to buy players.

""As the license conditions are written today, the sale would not be allowed,"" Britain's technology minister Chris Philp told Sky News.

""If a buyer emerged it would be open to that buyer or to that football club to approach the government and ask for the conditions to be varied in a way that allows that sale to take place.""

The sanctions on Abramovich, which froze all his UK assets over his ""clear"" links to Russian President Vladimir Putin, brought a halt to plans that he had of selling the club in the wake of the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine.

Separately, London-listed Russian steelmaker Evraz, in which Abramovich is the largest shareholder according to Refinitiv Eikon, said on Friday its entire board had quit.

Meanwhile, German coach Thomas Tuchel insisted it was ""business as usual"" as Chelsea played their Premier League match against Norwich City just hours after the UK government announced the strict measures on the London club's Russian owner.

Food export markets 'must remain open' says German minister

Global food markets must stay open without export restrictions to ensure supplies to poor countries in particular, German Agriculture Minister Cem Özdemir said.

The war in Ukraine has caused surging food prices amid tight supplies as a growing list of key producing countries seeking to keep vital food supplies within their borders. But Özdemir told German television ZDF: ""Markets must remain open.""

""We must ensure that the grain that is available is available fairly at affordable prices,"" he added as wheat prices hit a 14-year high with no end in sight to the conflict.

Russia and Ukraine provide nearly 30% of all global wheat exports.

Ukraine will no longer buy Russian nuclear fuel

Ukraine's state-owned nuclear power firm Energoatom will no longer buy Russian nuclear fuel, Reuters news agency reported the company as saying.

The country operates nuclear reactors from the Soviet era and imports its fuel from Russia and the United States.

Last week, Europe's largest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine, was caught in the crossfire after fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces caused a fire at the power station.

While no radiation leaks were detected and staff continue to work on the site, the incident sparked fears of a possible nuclear disaster among global leaders.

Air Astana and Pegasus Airlines suspend flights to Russia

Kazakhstan's national airline Air Astana and Turkey's Pegasus Airlines said Friday they were temporarily suspending flights to Russia.

The Kazakh airline tweeted: ""Air Astana sincerely regrets to advise that due the withdrawal of insurance coverage for commercial flights to, from and over the Russian Federation, all flights to the Russian Federation are suspended with immediate effect."" In a statement, Air Astana said it hoped to ""restore flights as soon as possible.""

Turkish budget airline Pegasus Airlines said that its flights to Russia will be suspended from March 13 to 27.

Pegasus said the decision to halt flights was brought about by ""operational risks"" from the sanctions imposed by the European Union.

Russia to declare cease-fire, open evacuation corridors

Russia's Defense Ministry will announce a partial cease-fire on Friday, enabling an opening of routes for the evacuation of Ukrainian citizens from five cities, according to the RIA and Interfax news agencies.

The agencies quoted the ministry as saying people could travel to Russia or other cities in Ukraine.

""From 10:00 am Moscow time (0700 GMT/UTC) on March 11, 2022, the Russian Federation will declare a 'regime of silence' and is ready to provide humanitarian corridors,"" Interfax reported, citing a statement.

The five cities are Kyiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Mariupol and Chernihiv.

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said she hopes the route for the besieged city of Mariupol will be successfully opened. Previous attempts to open such a corridor came under fire by Russian forces, Ukrainian officials said.

Vereshchuk added that buses would be sent to multiple Kyiv suburbs to bring people to the capital, and to bring aid to those staying behind.

Civilian targets shelled in Dnipro, Lutsk

Civilian targets came under Russian shelling in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, killing one, emergency services said.

It appeared to be the first direct attack on the city.

Emergency services said three airstrikes hit a kindergarten, an apartment building and a shoe factory.

Shelling was also reported Friday near the airport in Lutsk, a city in north-western Ukraine, the mayor wrote on Facebook.

Russia's Defense Ministry said its troops targeted airports in Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk, another western Ukrainian city some 250 kilometers (155 miles) south of Lutsk.

Orban: EU will not impose sanctions on Russian gas or oil

The European Union will not impose sanctions on Russian gas or oil, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Friday.

""The most important issue for us has been settled in a favorable way: there won't be sanctions that would apply to gas or oil, so Hungary's energy supply is secure in the upcoming period,"" Orban said in a video posted on his Facebook page.

Orban's comments came as EU leaders gathered in France to discuss ways of helping Ukraine.

Facebook allows posts calling for violence against Russian soldiers, Putin

Meta Platforms will allow Facebook and Instagram users in some countries to call for violence against Russian troops, Reuters reported Friday. It represents a temporary shift in Meta's hate speech policy.

The social media giant is also temporarily allowing some posts that call for the death of Russian President Vladimir Putin or Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.

A Meta statement on the issue read: ""As a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we have temporarily made allowances for forms of political expression that would normally violate our rules like violent speech such as 'death to the Russian invaders.' We still won't allow credible calls for violence against Russian civilians.""

The Russian Embassy in the United States demanded that Washington stop Meta's ""extremist activities,"" Reuters news agency reported.

""Users of Facebook & Instagram did not give the owners of these platforms the right to determine the criteria of truth and pit nations against each other,"" the embassy said on Twitter.

Russian officials later said Meta would be shut down in Russia if it allowed calls for Putin's death.

US and allies plan to cut Russia's trade status

US President Joe Biden is expected to call for an end of normal trade relations with Russia later on Friday.

Despite the tense relationship between Washington and Moscow, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the US currently still affords ""most favored nation status"" to Russia.

The designation means that a country with the clause must give the same concessions, privileges, or immunities to nations with it as to any other World Trade Organization member.

Removing the special status from Russia would allow the US and allies to impose tariffs on Russian imports, increasing the isolation of the Russian economy in retaliation for the invasion.

The move is expected to be coordinated with other G7 allies, including the UK.

In the US, removing Russia's ""Permanent Normal Trade Relations"" (PNTR) status will require an act of Congress.

However, lawmakers in both houses of Congress — and on both sides of the aisle — have already signaled their support, officials say.

US passes bill for $14 billion to Ukraine

US lawmakers have passed a huge spending bill that includes almost $14 billion (about €12.7 billion) in humanitarian and military aid for Ukraine.

The money for Kyiv, which piggybacked on wider spending legislation, had support from both Democrats and Republicans who have both rallied behind sending aid to the country.

""We're keeping our promise to support Ukraine as they fight for their lives against the evil Vladimir Putin,"" Chuck Schumer, the leader of the Senate Democrats, said in a statement.

The emergency aid was said to be more than double what US President Joe Biden's administration had originally requested.

The House of Representatives had passed the bill a day earlier, with the bill now heading to Biden's desk. The aid package is certain to be signed into law by the US president.

Around half the money is for arming and equipping Ukraine and for the Pentagon's costs for sending US troops to Ukraine's next-door neighbors.

Much of the remaining sum includes humanitarian and economic help, protecting energy supplies, and cybersecurity.

UN Security Council to meet at Russia's behest

The US Security Council is set to meet later on Friday to discuss Russia's claims about alleged US ""military biological activities"" in Ukraine.

The allegations were made earlier this week, without evidence, by Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova.

Washington has responded, saying the claim was ""exactly the kind of false flag effort we have warned Russia might initiate to justify a biological or chemical weapons attack.""

That statement suggested Russia might seek to create a pretext for further escalating the two-week-old conflict that has seen the Russian offensive slowed, but not stopped, by Ukraine's troops.

""We're not going to let Russia gaslight the world or use the UN Security Council as a venue for promoting their disinformation,"" Olivia Dalton, spokesperson for the US Mission to the United Nations said late Thursday.

For years, the international community for years has assessed that Russia has used chemical weapons in carrying out assassination attempts against opponents of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Russia also backs Syria's Bashar al-Assad, whose regime has used chemical weapons against its people in an 11-year-long civil war.

Satellite pics show Kyiv-bound convoy dispersal

Satellite images appear to show a huge Russian convoy, mired outside the Ukrainian capital since last week, has broken up and redeployed.

The pictures from Maxar Technologies showed the 40-mile (64-kilometer) line of vehicles, including tanks and artillery, has dispersed.

Armored units have been seen in towns near the Antonov Airport north of the city and some have moved into forests, Maxar reported.

The convoy's advance on Kyiv appeared to have stalled last week amid reports of food and fuel shortages.

According to US officials, Ukrainian troops also targeted the line of hardware with anti-tank missiles.

Convoy elements appear to have deployed further north of the airport near the town of Lubyanka, with towed artillery howitzers in firing positions.

Summary of events in Ukraine-Russia crisis on Thursday

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said nearly half of the capital's residents had fled and the city had been turned into a fortress on Thursday.

Russian troops have taken over the outskirts in the north and northwest of the city. But the former boxing champion Klitschko said the city was determined not to fall.

""Every street, every building, every checkpoint has been fortified,"" he said in a televised address. ""Even people who in their lives never intended to change their clothes, now they are in uniform with machine guns in their hands.""

Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused Russian forces of targeting a humanitarian corridor in the city of Mariupol in an operation of ""outright terror.""

Zelenskyy said that, while some 100,000 people have been evacuated from the country's cities in just two days, some city residents have no way out.

The president said he had decided to send a convoy of trucks with food, water and medicine, but that ""the occupiers launched a tank attack exactly where this corridor was supposed to be.""

After international condemnation of a Russian strike on a hospital in Mariupol, Russia's Defense Ministry later denied hitting the building.

More than 2.3 million people have fled Ukraine so far, according to the latest UN tally, around half of them children.

In a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron called for a halt to military action in Ukraine.

However, Ukraine and Russia made ""no progress"" toward agreeing on a 24-hour cease-fire after talks in Turkey. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba had been meeting Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

""It seems that there are other decision-makers for this matter in Russia,"" Kuleba said, in a thinly veiled reference to Putin.

Putin on Thursday said his compatriots would find a way to ""adapt"" to the massive international sanctions and withdrawals of Western corporations in response to the invasion of Ukraine.

Members of Putin's inner circle hit by Western sanctions Roman Abramovich Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich is one of the latest billionaires to be blacklisted. Last week, he put the club up for sale and promised to donate money from the proceeds to help war victims in Ukraine. But the UK government thwarted his plans by freezing his assets on March 10. In 2008, Abramovich's net worth peaked at $23.5 billion, making him Russia's richest man.

Members of Putin's inner circle hit by Western sanctions Igor Sechin Sechin is the former deputy prime minister of Russia and the CEO of state oil company Rosneft. The EU sanctions document describes him as one of Putin’s ""closest advisers, and his personal friend."" It added that Sechin supports the consolidation of the illegally-annexed Crimea into Russia, noting Rosneft's involvement in delivering fuel to an airport on the peninsula.

Members of Putin's inner circle hit by Western sanctions Alisher Usmanov Born in Uzbekistan, Usmanov is a metals and telecoms tycoon. The EU cited him as one of Putin's favorite oligarchs, and said he paid millions to one of his key advisers, and hosted Putin in his personal luxury residence. He also ""fronted for President Putin and solved his business problems,"" the EU alleged. The United States and the United Kingdom added him to their blacklist on Wednesday.

Members of Putin's inner circle hit by Western sanctions Mikhail Fridman and Petr Aven The EU has described Fridman as ""a top Russian financier and enabler of Putin's inner circle."" He and his long-term partner, Petr Aven (seen left in the picture), have earned billions of dollars from oil, banking and retail, according to the Reuters news agency. Aven, the EU document said, is one of the wealthy Russian businessmen who regularly meet with Putin at the Kremlin.

Members of Putin's inner circle hit by Western sanctions Reject ties with Putin, Kremlin Fridman (center) and Aven both rejected any ""financial or political relationship with President Putin or the Kremlin"" in a press conference Tuesday, adding that they would contest the unfounded basis for the imposition of the sanctions ""through all means available to them."" Born in western Ukraine, Fridman is among the few sanctioned Russians who have publicly spoken against the war.

Members of Putin's inner circle hit by Western sanctions Boris and Igor Rotenberg The Rotenberg family is known for its close ties with Putin. Boris is the co-owner of SMP Bank, linked to the energy firm Gazprom. Older brother Arkady, who is already under EU and US sanctions, has practiced judo with Putin since they were both teenagers. Igor, Arkady's son, controls the drilling company Gazprom Bureniye. Boris and Igor were blacklisted by the UK and US on March 2.

Members of Putin's inner circle hit by Western sanctions Gennady Timchenko Timchenko is a major shareholder of Rossiya Bank which, according to the EU sanctions document, is considered the personal bank of senior Russian officials. The bank has invested in television stations that actively support the Russian government's policies destabilizing Ukraine. Rossiya Bank has also opened branches in Crimea, supporting its illegal annexation, the EU said.

Members of Putin's inner circle hit by Western sanctions Alexei Mordashov Mordashov has heavily invested in National Media Group, the largest private media holding in Russia, which supports the state's policies of destabilizing Ukraine, the EU alleged. In a statement, the billionaire replied he had ""nothing to do with the emergence of the current geopolitical tension,"" while calling the war a ""tragedy of two fraternal peoples.""

The Take podcast: Is Russia’s Syria playbook being used in Ukraine?

What can 11 years of war in Syria tell us about Ukraine? This week marks the anniversary of Syria’s uprising and there still seems to be no end to conflict in sight.

There’s also another date that resonates: September 30, 2015, when Russia intervened on behalf of President Bashar al-Assad’s government.

Russia said it tested at least 320 new types of weapons in Syria, some of which are now in use in the war in Ukraine, and it is using tactics that seem to come from what has been called the “Syria playbook”.

We look at how the people all too familiar with that playbook see Syria’s story in Ukraine.

The lender added that if the conflict is prolonged, the situation will worsen. Citing wartime data for conflicts in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen, it predicted the “annual output contraction could eventually be much higher, in the range of 25 to 35 percent.”

Russian troops have refocused their efforts to seize Kyiv, firing artillery on suburbs, a local official said on Ukrainian television.

The official also said a town councillor for Brovary, east of Kyiv, had been killed in fighting there and shells fell on the towns of Irpin, Bucha and Hostomel, which have seen some of the worst conflict during Russia’s stalled attempt to take the capital.

Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan, reporting from Kyiv, said residents in the capital were in for another nervous night, after the shelling of an apartment block in the early morning hours killed at least one person.

“A lot of the residents are very worried that that [attack] may have been an opening salvo for the war for control of the capital,” Khan said. “Military analysts are suggesting it may have been a way to keep pressure on the Ukrainians even as the talks were going on.”

Erdogan says unclear whether Turkey will buy more Russian arms

Turkey’s President Tayyip Erdogan has said it is too early to comment on Turkey’s possible purchase of more Russian weapons given Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

“Under the current circumstances, it would be premature to talk about what the future shows right now. We have to see what the conditions bring,” Erdogan said, speaking in Ankara alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

NATO member Turkey was handed US sanctions in December 2020 over its purchase of Russian S-400 missile defence systems and had been criticised by Western allies over the move. Ankara has said it was forced to opt for the Russian weapons because allies did not provide arms on satisfactory terms.

Russian default no longer ‘improbable’

Russia may default on its debts in the wake of unprecedented sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine, but that would not trigger a global financial crisis, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has said.

Georgieva told CBS’s “Face the Nation” programme that sanctions imposed by the United States and other democracies were already having a “severe” effect on the Russian economy and would trigger a deep recession there this year.

The sanctions were limiting Russia’s ability to access its resources and service its debts, which meant a default was no longer viewed as “improbable,” the IMF official said.

Asked if such a default could trigger a financial crisis around the world, she said, “For now, no.”

‘Never heard of that’: China responds to reports Russia sought military help

The spokesperson for China’s embassy in Washington has responded to media reports that Moscow had asked Beijing for military equipment since launching its invasion of Ukraine by saying, “I’ve never heard of that.”

The spokesperson, Liu Pengyu, said China’s priority was to prevent the tense situation in Ukraine from getting out of control.

“The current situation in Ukraine is indeed disconcerting,” he said in an emailed response to an inquiry from the Reuters news agency.

“The high priority now is to prevent the tense situation from escalating or even getting out of control.”

Fatigued staff ‘stop safety-related repairs’ at Chernobyl

Staff operating radioactive waste facilities at the Chernobyl nuclear plant have stopped carrying out safety-related repairs due to exhaustion, as they have not been relieved since Russia seized the site last month, Ukraine has told the UN nuclear watchdog.

“The Ukrainian regulator informed the IAEA that staff at [Chernobyl] were no longer carrying out repair and maintenance of safety-related equipment, in part due to their physical and psychological fatigue after working non-stop for nearly three weeks,” the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement.

Civilians huddle underground as Russia bombards cities

LVIV, Ukraine, March 11 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Friday Ukraine was at a ""strategic turning point"" in the war as Russian forces bombarded cities across the country and appeared to be regrouping for a possible assault on Kyiv, with satellite images showing them firing artillery as they closed in on the capital.

The governor of the Kharkiv region, on the Russian border, said a psychiatric hospital had been hit, and the mayor of the city of Kharkiv said about 50 schools there had been destroyed.

Russia also carried out air strikes deeper into western Ukraine, far from the battlefields in the north, east and south where ground combat has raged.

In the besieged southern city of Mariupol, the city council said at least 1,582 civilians had been killed as a result of Russian shelling and a 12-day blockade that has left hundreds of thousands trapped with no food, water, heat or power.

Russia's defence ministry said the Black Sea port was now completely surrounded and Ukrainian officials accused Russia of deliberately preventing civilians getting out and humanitarian convoys getting in.

A new effort to evacuate civilians along a humanitarian corridor from Mariupol appeared to have failed, with Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk saying Russian shelling prevented them from leaving.

""The situation is critical,"" Ukrainian interior ministry adviser Vadym Denysenko said.

Western countries meanwhile took more economic steps to try to force Russian President Vladimir Putin to end his assault.

President Joe Biden, who this week banned U.S. imports of Russian oil, said the G7 industrialised nations would revoke Russia's ""most favoured nation"" trade status. He also announced a U.S. ban on imports of Russian seafood, alcohol and diamonds. Washington later sanctioned more oligarchs and elites, including board members of Russian banks, in addition to a dozen lawmakers. read more

European Union leaders said they were ready to impose harsher sanctions on Russia and might give Ukraine more funds for arms. But they rejected Ukraine's request to join the bloc.

At a meeting with Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, Putin said there were ""certain positive shifts"" in talks with Kyiv, but did not elaborate.

GEARING UP

With the Russian assault in its third week, Zelenskiy, who has rallied his people with a series of addresses from Kyiv, said Ukraine had ""already reached a strategic turning point"".

""It is impossible to say how many days we still have (ahead of us) to free Ukrainian land. But we can say we will do it,"" he said. ""We are already moving towards our goal, our victory.""

Russia's main force has been stalled north of Kyiv, having failed in what Western analysts say was an initial plan for a lightning assault.

But images taken on Friday and released by private U.S. satellite firm Maxar showed Russian forces were continuing to deploy closer to Kyiv and firing artillery toward residential areas, according to the company's analysis.

Multiple homes and buildings were on fire and widespread damage was seen throughout the town of Moschun, northwest of Kyiv, Maxar said. Reuters could not independently verify the images.

Britain's defence ministry said Russia appeared to be gearing up for a new offensive in coming days that would probably include Kyiv.

However, the Russian ground forces were still making only limited progress, hampered by logistical problems and Ukrainian resistance, it said in its intelligence update.

The Ukrainian general staff said Russian forces were regrouping after taking heavy losses. Ukrainian troops had pushed some back to ""unfavourable positions"" near the Belarus border, it said.

Kyiv's mayor, former heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, said the capital had enough essential supplies to last a couple of weeks. Supply lines remained open.

'WRONG ASSUMPTIONS'

Ukrainian authorities said a psychiatric hospital near the eastern town of Izyum had been hit. Emergency services said no one was hurt, but Kharkiv governor Oleh Synegubov called the attack a war crime. Reuters could not verify the report.

Moscow denies it has been targeting civilians in what it calls a ""special operation"" to disarm and ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine. Ukraine and its allies say this was a baseless pretext for Russia's invasion of the democratic country of 44 million.

Air strikes near a kindergarten in the central city of Dnipro killed at least one person on Friday, emergency services said.

The mayor of Lutsk said four people were killed and six wounded in an attack on an airfield - a rare strike so far into western Ukraine. A U.S. official said such attacks were aimed at preventing western bases from being used by Ukraine's air force. read more

Britain's defense intelligence ministry said Russian air and missile forces struck the western city of Ivano-Frankivsk in the past 24 hours.

In Kharkiv, hundreds were sheltering in metro stations.

Nastya, a young girl lying on a makeshift bed on the floor of a train carriage, said she had been there for over a week, unable to move around much and ill with a virus.

""I'm scared for my home, for the homes of my friends, very scared for the whole country, and scared for myself of course,"" she said. read more

Moscow said its separatist allies in the southeast had captured the town of Volnovakha, north of Mariupol.

But Mathieu Boulegue, an expert at London's Chatham House think tank, said Moscow might not have sufficient troops to achieve its goals.

""You can't invade a country on a one-on-one ratio (of troops). Nobody has done it, which means that either something was wrong or they had very wrong assumptions,"" he told Reuters.

In a nighttime video address, Zelenskiy accused Russia of abducting the mayor of Melitopol, a captured city in southeastern Ukraine, calling it a ""new stage of terror."" Russia has not commented on the fate of Mayor Ivan Fedorov.

Zelenskiy said 7,144 people were evacuated from four cities on Friday, a sharply lower number than each of the two previous days. He accused Russian troops of refusing to allow civilians out of Mariupol and vowed to try to deliver food and medicines there on Saturday.

Ukraine also raised the prospect of Moscow's ally Belarus entering the war, accusing Russia of staging ""false flag"" air attacks on Belarus from Ukraine to provide an excuse.

Belarus has served as a staging post for Russian forces before and after the Feb. 24 invasion. The Kremlin did not respond to a request for comment.

Putin and Lukashenko agreed Moscow would supply its smaller neighbour with up-to-date military equipment, the official Belarus Belta news agency said.

NO EU MEMBERSHIP

Away from the battlefields, EU leaders meeting near Paris agreed to spend more on defence and cut reliance on Russian energy supplies by 2027. But they declined Ukraine's call for a speedy admission to the EU.

Western countries have moved to isolate Russia from the global financial system. The Russian rouble ended a third week of hefty losses, stripped of a third of its value in Moscow exchanges since Russia invaded Ukraine. read more

7,0117d20d-b0fa-47ba-b496-0033496e7ec8,[],2022-03-11 00:00:00,"In a fast-breaking meeting called by Russia to address its claims of United States support for military biological research in Ukraine, Ms. DiCarlo said Russian armed forces are pursuing laying siege to several cities in the south, east and north of the country, with a large concentration reportedly massed along several approaches to the capital, Kyiv.

#Ukraine's cities are being devastated. Civilians are dying. Indiscriminate attacks, including those using cluster munitions, of a nature to strike military objectives and civilians or civilian objects without discrimination are prohibited by international law. Stop the war now. https://t.co/LiTXXsnPrQ — Rosemary A. DiCarlo (@DicarloRosemary) March 11, 2022

The situation is particularly alarming in Mariupol, Kharkiv, Sumy and Chernihiv, she said, where shelling of residential areas and civilian infrastructure has resulted in an increasing number of civilians killed and injured.

“The utter devastation being visited on these cities is horrific,” she stressed.

Civilians ‘inexcusably’ targeted

As of 11 March, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 1,546 civilian casualties - including 564 killed and 982 injured - since the start of the Russian invasion.

The real casualty figures are likely “considerably higher”. Most have been caused by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including heavy artillery, multi-launch rocket systems and air strikes.

Further, she said OHCHR has received credible reports of Russian forces using cluster munitions in populated areas - indiscriminate attacks, which are prohibited under international humanitarian law.

As of 10 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) verified 26 attacks on health facilities, health workers and ambulances, causing 12 deaths and 34 injuries. This includes the bombing of the Mariupol maternity hospital on 9 March, which she condemned.

Ms. Di Carlo went on to describe the targeting of civilians, residential buildings, hospitals, schools and kindergartens as “inexcusable and intolerable”, emphasizing that all alleged violations of international humanitarian law must be investigated, and perpetrators held accountable.

Millions in dire need of aid

Ms. Di Carlo said humanitarian aid is being scaled up in areas where security permits and has reached more than 500,000 people. The UN and partners have developed operational plans to meet humanitarian needs where they are most acute, she said, appealing to donors who pledged over $1.5 billion to the appeal last week, to release the funding quickly.

Evacuations must continue

It is critical to achieve a ceasefire to allow for the safe passage of civilians from besieged areas, she told ambassadors.

On 9 March, more than 51,000 people were reportedly evacuated through five out of six agreed-upon safe passages. These evacuations must continue.

The number of refugees fleeing the violence has reached 2.5 million – all of whom, including third country nationals, need access to safety and protection, in line with the principle of non-refoulement, and without discrimination.

‘Logic of dialogue’ must prevail

“The need for negotiations to stop the war in Ukraine could not be more urgent”, she said, noting that three rounds of talks held thus far between Ukrainian and Russian delegations must be intensified – notably to secure humanitarian and ceasefire arrangements as a matter of priority. “The logic of dialogue and diplomacy must prevail over the logic of war.”

Perhaps most alarming are the risks the violence poses to the global framework for peace and security, she said, adding that: “We must do everything we can to find a solution and put an end to this war; we must do it now.”

Russia biological weapons claim refuted

Today’s meeting comes on the heels of claims by Russian Ministry of Defence Spokesperson Major General Igor Konashenkov on 6 March, his country’s military had uncovered evidence of US-funded military biological programmes in Ukraine, including documents confirming the development of “biological weapons components”.

Addressing those concerns, High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, Izumi Nakamitsu, said the “United Nations is not aware of any biological weapons programmes”.

Nor is it in a position to confirm or deny” reports that public health facilities are in areas impacted by armed conflict, placing the safety of those facilities at risk. She appealed to all parties in the conflict to ensure the safety of all such facilities in Ukraine.

Explaining that the Russian Federation and Ukraine are both States parties to the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention - which prohibits their development, production, acquisition, transfer, stockpiling and use - and that Moscow is a depositary Government, she said biological weapons have been outlawed since the Convention entered into force in 1975.

With 183 States parties to the treaty, biological weapons are “universally seen as being abhorrent and illegitimate,” she stressed.

Assessing compliance: A State responsibility

However, the Convention lacks a multilateral verification mechanism overseen by an independent organization, such as the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), meaning that the responsibility of assessing compliance rests with States parties.

The treaty does contain several measures for States to address concerns or suspicions about the activities of their peers, Ms. Nakamitsu said. Under Article V, for example, States parties can consult and cooperate to resolve any problems which may arise. An annual exchange of information has been established, based upon the submission of confidence-building measures.

The Russian Federation and Ukraine both participate annually in the confidence-building measures, and their annual reports are available to all States parties for the purposes of transparency and reassurance.

Complaints procedure

In addition, she said that under Article VI, a State Party which finds that its peer is in breach of its obligations can lodge a complaint with the Security Council. An investigation based on the complaint can then be initiated, if agreed by the Council.

Noting that Article VI has never been activated – and that these provisions have not been regularly used – they are nonetheless internationally agreed procedures available to defuse tensions.

“I would, therefore, encourage the Biological Chemical Weapons States parties to consider making use of the available procedures for consultation and cooperation to resolve these issues,” she said. “Situations such as this demonstrate the need to strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention, to operationalize and institutionalize it.”

Addressing other concerns, she warned that an accident involving the nuclear facilities in Ukraine could have severe consequences for public health and the environment and all steps must be taken to avoid it.

“The possibility of an accident caused by failure to a reactor’s power supply or the inability to provide regular maintenance is growing by the day,” she stressed. The forces in effective control of nuclear power plants in Ukraine must ensure their safe and secure operation.

‘Extreme concern’ over nuclear plants

She expressed extreme concern that four of the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) seven pillars for the safe and secure operation of facilities, are reportedly not being implemented at Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhya – Europe’s largest reactor.

“Communications must be fully restored, and operating staff must be allowed to properly carry out their duties and to do so free of undue pressure,” she asserted.

The Council has held three briefings on the situation in Ukraine since the Russian Federation launched its military assault on 24 February, addressing humanitarian needs (28 February and 7 March) and the safety of nuclear sites (4 March).

Russian allegations

Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said his delegation convened the meeting because during what it still maintains is a “special military operation”, it had discovered a “truly shocking” emergency clean up by “the Kyiv regime” of traces of a biological military operation, with support from the United States Department of Defense.

He said the Russian Ministry of Defence has documents on its website confirming that a network of 30 biological labs across Ukraine – in Odessa, Kyiv, Dniper Kherson and elsewhere - were conducting “very dangerous” experiments to strengthen the pathogenic qualities of the plague, anthrax, cholera and other lethal diseases using synthetic biology.

Some were aimed at spreading infection through migratory birds and bats, while others – funded by the United States – used excto-parasites, like lice and fleas, a particularly reckless endeavour as it would not allow for controlling how a situation could develop.

He said the results were being sent to the military biological centres in the United States, including the Walter Reade Army Institute of Research, the Naval Medical Research Center, and the Biological Warfare Laboratories, at Fort Detrick in Maryland.

“Biological threats know no borders,” he warned. “No region in the world can feel safe”. He accused the United States of blocking a legally binding protocol to create a verification mechanism, leading Moscow to believe that “they have something to hide”. The Russian Federation will not exclude the possibility of invoking the Convention’s Articles V and VI, he said, but for now, it expects to hear responses from the United States.

US accuses Russia of lies, disinformation

To those claims, United States Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Moscow called today’s meeting for “the sole purpose of lying and spreading disinformation”.

Last month, she said, United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken, laid out with “tragic accuracy” what Russia would do, warning it would manufacture a pretext for an attack, even cautioning it would fabricate claims of biological or chemical weapons activities to justify its own violent attacks against Ukrainians.

“The Russian Federation is attempting to use the Security Council to legitimize disinformation and deceive people to justify President [Vladimir] Putin’s war of choice against the Ukrainian people,” she said, adding that China too has spread disinformation in support of Russia’s “outrageous” claims.

“I will say this once: Ukraine does not have a biological weapons programme. There are no Ukrainian biological weapons laboratories supported by the United States - not near Russia’s border or anywhere,” she affirmed.

Laying out the facts, she said Ukraine owns and operates its own public health laboratory infrastructure, with facilities that make it possible to detect and diagnose disease like COVID-19, “which benefit us all.” The United States has assisted Ukraine to do this safely, with work undertaken proudly, clearly and in the open.

She accused the Russian Federation of having long maintained a biological weapons programme, with a well-documented history of nerve agent attacks, notably against Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny and former Russian military intelligence officer Sergei Skripal.

“It continues to shield the [Bashar al] Assad regime in Syria from accountability when the United Nations and OPCW found that it had used chemical weapons repeatedly over the years. Its call for the Council meeting is “potential false flag operation in action,” she said.

China’s concerns

“Biological weapons are weapons of mass destruction,” said China’s Ambassador Zhang Jun. “Any information on bio-military activities should trigger high attention from the international community.”

He noted with concern, credible information released by Moscow, stressing that its concerns should be “properly addressed”. He pressed States parties to implement their Convention obligations, provide clarification and accept multilateral verification.

He also took note of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) press report advising Ukraine to destroy pathogens in its laboratories to prevent spread of infectious diseases, and looked forward to receiving more information in this regard.

He firmly rejected claims against China made by the United States representative. The international community has raised awareness around the US military’s biological activities, with 336 labs around the world. “If the United States believes information is fake, all they can do is to provide relevant data to us so the international community can draw its conclusions on its own”.

Russian aggression ‘threatens us all’ warns Ukraine

Ukraine’s Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya directed his comments to “the representative of the aggressor State, who sits in the seat of the Soviet Union” – whose aggressor State status was recognized by General Assembly resolution ES 11/1, adopted overwhelmingly on 2 March at an emergency session.

He quoted Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov who said on 10 March that “we do not plan to attack other countries; we did not attack Ukraine either”. The Russian Embassy in London then Tweeted that a pregnant woman was “wearing makeup and playing multiple roles of pregnant women in Mariupol.”

He said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov then told reporters in aftermath of the strike on 9 March that “Russian forces do not fire on civilian targets”, before clarifying later that the Kremlin would “look into the incident because you and I do not have clear information on what happened there”.

On 10 March, Mr. Lavrov claimed without evidence that the attack on the Mariupol hospital was warranted because the building had been seized by Ukrainian armed groups.

“Whatever the gentleman in the Soviet seat may say in reply is most probably useless,” he cautioned.

By calling today’s meeting, the aggressor State has “shot itself in the foot”, he said, as Ukraine runs a health system that is in full compliance with its international obligations.

He underscored that Ukrainians are being killed and cities are being destroyed. People are being buried in mass graves in Ukraine's cities, for the first time since the Second World War. He urged the world to be ""resolute in countering such barbaric actions.""

“Russian aggression threatens us all” he said.

Finally, he read from an open letter penned by 194 Nobel Laureates, who equated Russia’s actions with those of Nazi Germany in 1939 against Poland - using feigned provocation - adding their voices in condemning Russia's military tactics.",https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/03/1113812
