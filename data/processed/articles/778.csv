Warsaw, Poland

12:57 P.M. CEST



PRESIDENT DUDA: (As interpreted.) Your Excellency and distinguished Madam Vice President of the United States of America, distinguished ladies and gentlemen: This is a very important moment in our relations. But, first and foremost, under these circumstances which we are facing right now in Europe, behind our Eastern border, in Ukraine — friendly to us and with us — where the Russian troops are carrying out a barbarious aggression and murdering innocent people, murdering civilians, bombing maternity hospitals from which, under dramatic circumstances, wounded women right before labor — are being carried out.



None of us has ever expected that we would be able to see such things in the 21st century.



Especially it is a great satisfaction to all of us here in Poland that Madam Vice President of the United States of America, Ms. Kamala Harris, is here with us in Warsaw, in our country.



And she’s demonstrating that strength and depth of the atlantic — transatlantic and Allied bond, demonstrating decisive engagement and commitment of the United States to the security of NATO’s eastern flank and to Europe as a whole.



Let me stress very forcefully: There is no doubt whatsoever that together with the United States and our other Allies within the framework of the North Atlantic Alliance, and along with the entire free and honest world, we stand with Ukraine. We stand with Ukraine, and we will try to do our best to make sure that Ukraine can be defended.



Thank you very much, Madam Vice President, for coming. Thank you for our meetings today, for the conversations that we have had.



We had a meeting just a couple of minutes ago. We had a private meeting, a tête-à-tête meeting. And we also met with Polish and American delegations. We discussed all the important topics. And I highlighted very forcefully how important it is, and I thanked also for the position of the President of the United States, Mr. Joe Biden. I thanked for the position of Madam Vice President and her team. But I also thanked for the position of the U.S. Congress.



I thanked for this necessity and, actually, the imposition of effective sanctions on the Russian Federation. The United States is in the vanguard of those sanctions, and, speaking honestly, these sanctions are working.



Above all, thank you also for all the support which is being provided to the fight in Ukraine — to Ukraine, which is defending itself.



Thank you for the humanitarian assistance, which is being supplied there.



And to you, Madam Vice President, I would like to thank for the involvement of all the organizations and of all the NGOs that are being involved in providing assistance — humanitarian assistance. Also, they’re providing medical aid. They’re providing equipment for children, for wounded, for the sick.



My wife Agata is involved in this as well. And I know that, in those respect, she is in cooperation with various institutions from the United States. She is in contact with the First Lady of the United States, Jill Biden.



I’m very happy that this Polish-American cooperation is developing. But I’m pleased that it serves to provide common aid to the fight in Ukraine and common aid to all those who are suffering, all those who need this assistance from us.



And today, I shared with Madam Vice President — I described the situation that we are facing. I said that, today, for a number of days actually, we have been receiving refugees from Ukraine in Poland. This number is close to 1.5 million persons who have come to us. And I’m addressing my compatriots right now. I was proud to tell Madam Vice President that all those people have not been sent to any camps and refugee camps. They have been accepted and received by Polish families in Polish homes. They are accommodated in Polish hotels, in Polish spa resorts, in Polish motels.



Most often, however, they’re accommodated with private people. They have been received by ordinary Polish people who feel in their hearts that they should extend a helping hand to the people in need.



And I thank you so much for this, to my fellow Polish people. This is a reason to be proud for us, for the Polish authorities. And I’m very, very much grateful to you for that.



At the same time, I asked Madam Vice President for support, as it is quite obvious that such a huge refugee crisis is a surprise for Poland. And it is a complicated situation for Poland, for the Polish authorities in the era of the crisis. The prices are growing — of fuel prices are growing; generally, the prices are growing. That is why we do need this support. And I’m going to be hugely grateful for any form of support because we have to survive this difficult time.



And we have to do that by helping our neighbors, because that is extremely important right now.



However, first and foremost, we discussed security issues.



The presence of Madam Vice President here in Poland is yet another demonstration of U.S. presidents — of U.S. presence in Poland, next to the U.S. troops that we have here, next to U.S. defensive systems that are protecting our skies today and our land.



We also have with us here today the political representation, the top-level political representation of the United States, led by Madam Vice President.



And this is a very clear political message where important — most important things are happening today on the global stage in Europe: We have to rescue Ukraine. All of us are acutely aware of that. All hands should be on board. Ukraine needs to be helped. And we have to stay united in that respect. We need to stand together in this respect within the North Atlantic Alliance, keeping solidarity, speaking absolutely with one voice, just as we have to stand together in the European Union and in all the other international communities. We have to impose more sanctions on Russia.



We cannot accept such military activities, which bear the characteristics of the features of a genocide, because I don’t think that anybody is in any doubt if hospitals are bombed, if hospitals are bombed where pregnant women are staying, where children are staying, when ordinary people are killed, where bombs are dropped, when missiles are launched into residential houses where there are no military installations, then this is an act of barbarity bearing the features of a genocide. It aims at eliminating and destroying a nation. Hence, we have to stand and present a very tough stance here as representatives of the free world.



And Poland stands here together with the United States of America, just like — I have no doubt about that — our Allies stand with Ukraine and all the honest authorities and states, especially democratic states.



And at the end of our conversation, I mentioned the fact that we want to boost our security also on our own here in Poland. Also, thanks to the purchase of American equipment for our armed forces, there are already ongoing programs such as Patriot programs, such as HIMARS program, the program of the purchase of F-35s, or the recently started program — the purchase of Abrams tanks for Poland.



I asked Madam Vice President that those programs should be accelerated as far as this as possible, because we want to provide this state-of-the-art equipment to our armed forces as soon as possible.



If there is such a need — I think everybody can see that. We do not need to comment on this situation. We are able to witness the dramatic scenes unfolding in Ukraine every day in the media. You can see those horrific — horrifying scenes.



But at the same time, we’re able to witness the huge heroism and incredible determination of the Ukrainian people. And we stand at the side of the Ukrainian people. We’re going to support them with all our strength, but at the same time providing the security of our countries which is of crucial importance to us.



Once again, thank you very much, Madam Vice President, for coming to Warsaw. Thank you for this demonstration that we stand together and that we are a huge Euro-Atlantic community of freedom and security. Thank you.



I’d like to give the floor to Madam Vice President of the United States of America. Madam Kamala Harris.



VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Thank you, President Duda, and for the warm welcome under unfortunate circumstances, given what is happening in Ukraine, our friend. But I thank you for the warm welcome and for the very constructive and productive conversations we had today as part of our ongoing dialogue and friendship that spans generations.



I would like to also speak directly to the Polish people. I have shared with your president that, under his leadership — and your leadership has been extraordinary — the world has been watching Poland, Mr. President, your leadership and the leadership of the people of your country. And we’ve witnessed extraordinary acts of generosity and kindness. We have seen through images on the television — looking at images of ordinary people doing extraordinary things in support of the dignity and the wellbeing of perfect strangers.



So I, first and foremost, want to express the thanks for the people of the United States to you, Mr. President, on behalf of our President, Joe Biden, and to the people of Poland for what you are doing every day. It really represents the best of who we are.



We are here and I am here in Poland today as part of an enduring, longstanding friendship and commitment between the United States and Poland based on shared values and priorities.



I am here, standing here on the northern flank — on the eastern flank talking about what we have in terms of the eastern flank and our NATO Allies and what is at stake at this very moment. What is at stake this very moment are some of the guiding principles around the NATO Alliance and, in particular, the issue and the importance of defending sovereignty and territorial integrity, in this case, of Ukraine.



As President Duda has described, we have been witnessing for weeks — and certainly just in the last 24 hours — atrocities of unimaginable proportion. A maternity hospital, a children’s hospital, where we have witnessed pregnant women who were there for care, for one reason — being taken out, because they required care because of an act of violence — unprovoked, unjustified.



I am here, in Poland, as an expression of the enduring and important relationship between the United States and Poland that, again, has been longstanding, but, in particular on the issue of Ukraine, is unified and is clear. We will do everything together, in partnership, in solidarity, to support what is necessary at this very moment in terms of the humanitarian and security needs of Ukraine and the Ukrainian people.



Today, we discussed, Mr. President, many issues that relate to our special bond also, because, I will say as a point of personal privilege, we have a substantial Polish American community in my hometown of Los Angeles but throughout the United States, who understands the relationship that we have on many levels, including the diplomatic but also cultural relationships that span generations.



And so, through all of that and in the spirit of those relationships and our shared commitments — our shared commitment to the importance of international norms and rules — you and I discussed today many important topics, in particular as it relates to the eastern flank. And we talked specifically about what we cared deeply about in terms of our commitment — the United States commitment to Article 5.



I’ve said it many times; I will say it again: The United States commitment to Article 5 is ironclad. The United States is prepared to defend every inch of NATO territory. The United States takes seriously that an attack against one is an attack against all. We are here today to restate that commitment, but also do what we must do to reinforce our support of Poland and our Allies through the EU and NATO Alliance.



In particular, as it relates to troop deployment, we have recently deployed an additional 4,700 American troops to Poland. That’s on top of the years of rotation of about 5,000 American troops in Poland.



We are pleased to have announced this week that we have directed two Patriot missile defense systems to Poland. And today, I can announce that we have delivered those Patriot systems to Poland. We do this as a reminder and as a demonstration of our commitment to the security of our Allies and our commitment, in particular, to Poland at this moment in time.



As it relates to the people of Ukraine: They have suffered immensely. When we talk about humanitarian aid, it is because, yes, the assistance is necessary, but what compels us also is the moral outrage that all civilized nations feel when we look at what is happening to innocent men, women, children, grandmothers, grandfathers who are fleeing everything they’ve known. Our outrage, which compels not only our security assistance but our humanitarian assistance, is rooted in the fact that also we support the people of Ukraine who have shown extraordinary courage and skill and their willingness and, yes, ability to fight against Putin’s war and Russia’s aggression.



So, today we are also announcing, in pursuit of what must happen, which is to provide humanitarian assistance, that we will give another $50 million– the United States will — through the U.N.’s World Food Programme to assist with humanitarian aid.



The President and I also talked about the fact that, as he mentioned, Poland has taken, in just a very short period of time, in excess of one and a half million refugees in from Ukraine. And that has put an extraordinary burden on Poland and the people of Poland. And so, we will continue with the support that we can give you, Mr. President, in terms of the work that you and the people of Poland have been doing to bear this burden, but in a way that really has been with such grace

and such generosity.



We also are pleased to have shared with the President what our United States Congress has done, which is there is a commitment now of $13.6 billion in human- — humanitarian and security assistance that will be then distributed and shared with Ukraine and the people of this region and Europe, all again understanding that this moment in time requires both a humanitarian response as well as security assistance.



And today, I’m also pleased to say that we are in ongoing discussions with Poland and our Allies about the effectiveness of sanctions thus far and going forward. As we have announced in the United States, we have, through the United States Department of Justice, started a task force to do what is required and necessary and appropriate in terms of investigations as it relates to any criminal activities and behaviors on behalf of institutions and individuals, including oligarchs.



We talked — the President and I — about the effectiveness of the sanctions we’ve seen thus far, in terms of the courage and the bold action that has been taken through the NATO Alliance to do what is necessary to send a clear signal that there will be, as we promised, severe cost and consequence for Russia’s aggression to the point that we have now seen a freefall of the ruble, to the point that we have now seen that Russia’s credit rating has been rated as junk, and what we know to be real economic consequence to Russia because of Putin’s war.



As you know, the President of the United States also made the decision to do what was necessary in terms of the purchase of Russian oil in the United States.



Again, we will continue to focus on this issue, keeping in mind that this is a moment that requires severe and swift consequence for Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.



And I’ll close by saying what we say every day for these last weeks, which is we stand with the people of Ukraine, that we admire their courage, and that we are aligned in our support of their sovereignty and territorial integrity.



Thank you, Mr. President.



Q (As interpreted.) My name is Żaklina Skowrońska. I represent Polish Television. I would like to ask my question to both Madam Vice President and Mr. President. In what way has this brutal attack of Russia against Ukraine impacted Polish-American relations? Antony Blinken, State Secretary, during his last visit to Poland was saying that the Polish-American friendship has never been so strong in history as it is now. Is it going to translate also on the permanent military presence of the United States in Poland? Thank you very much.



VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: It cannot be said too frequently or strongly enough: The relationship between the United States and Poland is a deep, enduring, and strong one and, dare I say, has become even stronger when we have been faced as a world with such adversity. I think we all know, even in our personal lives, adversity really, truly, can present the real measure of an individual or a relationship. And what we have seen without any doubt is that this friendship and relationship between the United States and Poland is a strong one.



PRESIDENT DUDA: (As interpreted.) Ladies and gentlemen, answering your question, I want to go a little bit back into history — or deeper into history. Let me put it in the following way: When I started my service as President of the Republic of Poland in 2015, I was perfectly aware of the fact that an aggressive Russia, like President Lech Kaczyński was saying in Georgia in 2008, would not stop only attacking Georgia in 2008 and attacking part of Ukraine in 2014. I knew that this appetite, this imperial appetite will grow.



And if the world does not react to that — if the world does not react, if the North Atlantic Alliance does not stand up, does not present a tough stance, then we will see more attacks from Russia — to which perhaps, sooner or later, also my country, Poland, would fall victim to.



And when I started as President of Poland, I knew that I had to do everything that I could to protect Poland from such a scenario. One has to use very clear and strong words here in the presence of Madam Vice President of the United States. Those who understood well what I was saying back then, speaking about the Russian threat, were precisely the representatives of the United States, were the representatives of Barack Obama administration and the President himself back then, the U.S. generals as well.



And precisely thanks to their support, we were able to obtain the North Atlantic Alliance presence on the eastern flank, were able to execute the strengthening of the eastern flank for the first time since we joined NATO in 1999.



It was precisely in NATO Summit in Warsaw, through, first and foremost, the decisions of the U.S. President and his team, but also through the decisions of other Allies whom we were able to convince, has led to putting this presence on the eastern flank of the Alliance and, symbolically, in Poland.



The United States is the framework nation. At the same time, the U.S. soldiers came here and started the rotational presence in Poland. It is a rotational but also a persistent presence, enduring presence. It is a back-to-back presence. Soldiers change, but the U.S. armed forces are present on our soil all the time. And that was a breakthrough.



If we recall the words of President Lech Kaczyński, which I quoted many times and who said those words to me back in 2008, he said, and I quote: “Andrzej, when U.S. soldiers are on our soil, when U.S. military installations are on our soil, when U.S. military equipment is put in our soil, then the whole world will be able to see that we are no longer a Russian sphere of influence.” This is a true friendship.



As Madam Vice President remarked today, “A friend in need is a friend indeed.” That is why I’m really happy that today, when we are in need and when the NATO eastern flank is in need, the United States, by the decision of President Joe Biden, has deployed additional troops. The U.S. is deploying more troops, and the U.S. is announcing the strengthening of this presence in our part of Europe and also in Poland, because this is precisely the understanding of the geopolitics of strategic goals that have to be achieved by this geopolitics and by the free world. This is the understanding of the security.



Is Polish American presence today, if we look at the last couple of years, stronger than ever? Yes, Polish-American friendship, for sure, over the last seven years of my presidency is stronger than ever before.



And today’s presence here today in Warsaw of Madam Vice President Kamala Harris is yet another strong evidence of that, just as the presence of all the representatives of Mr. President Joe Biden’s administration here recently on our soil.



And also, this is evidenced by the frequency of contacts that I have with the President of the United States. We frequently talk and discuss the most important security-related topics and our mutual relations.



Yes, of course, whenever we speak about great politics and friendship, this is this friendship and great politics. And this is the friendship between states for sure. This is the friendship between Poland and the United States of America. It is very strong right now — the strongest perhaps ever in history.



WHITE HOUSE AIDE: The next question will come from Nandita Bose of Reuters.



Q Hi, Madam Vice President. Thank you for — and President Duda. Thank you for taking my question.



President Zelenskyy has strongly asked for better air power in recent days. And my question is: What kind of alternative plans does the United States have to get materials to help Ukraine defend itself, especially now that you have declined Poland’s offer on jets? Can you give us some specifics on what you discussed with the Polish leaders on this issue, Madam Vice President?



And one for President Duda. The United States says, Mr. President, it was not consulted before you made the offer to make your jets available to the United States. Is that accurate? And did Poland act unilaterally in making an offer? If yes, why? Especially now that you have spoken about the strong relationship that U.S. and Poland has shared over the years. Thank you.



VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: I want to be very clear: The United States and Poland are united in what we have done and are prepared to do to help Ukraine and the people of Ukraine, full stop.



In terms of the work that the United States has done thus far, we have, as you know, given military, humanitarian, and security assistance, and that is an ongoing process.



As I mentioned earlier, Congress — the United States Congress has now made a decision for 13-plus billion dollars of United States — of U.S. money to go to Ukraine and our European allies to assist in terms of both their security and humanitarian needs.



We have also, just this past week, given $240 million in security assistance delivered to Ukraine, and that’s on top of the $1 billion in just the past year that we have sent to Ukraine.



I can tell you that the issue facing the Ukrainian people and our Allies in the eastern flank is something that occupies one of our highest priorities in terms of paying attention to the needs, understanding it is a dynamic situation and it requires us to be nimble and to be swift.



I mentioned being swift in terms of accountability and consequence. We also fully appreciate we must be swift in terms of providing assistance where we can be helpful. And we will continue to do that.



Q Can you (inaudible) plans, especially in light of the issue with Poland on jets?



VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Well, we’re making deliveries every day, in terms of what we can do in terms of assistance and, in particular, when you look at what we’ve been doing, as it relates to anti-tank and anti — defense systems. That is an ongoing process, and that’s not going to stop to the extent that there is a need.



Thank you.



POLISH AIDE: (No translation provided.)



PRESIDENT DUDA: (As interpreted.) One moment. I need to give an answer as well.



Madam, that situation is extremely complicated, because we are all saying that there is a fight going on in Ukraine for independence, for sovereignty, for freedom, and for survival. And all of us support, with all the strength we have, the people of Ukraine.



It is not only the military. Also, the people of Ukraine have taken to arms to defend their homeland. It is not only men; it’s also women who fight on the frontline shoulder-to-shoulder with men in order to defend their country. And we have no doubt whatsoever that they need help and assistance.



Let me say something more. We accept that they have the right to demand this assistance from the international community. They can demand this support from NATO. We are providing them humanitarian assistance and material assistance the best we can. We are trying to do our best.



Some expectations were addressed in a very strong and unequivocal way, also towards us — towards Poland. However, we are members of the North Atlantic Alliance. And as far as security-related issues are concerned, we have to look at these not only through our own lens — through the prism of the security of Poland — but we also have to adopt the perspective of the security of NATO as a whole.



So, in a nutshell, we have to be a responsible member of the North Atlantic Alliance. That is why there were requests addressed to us. Those requests were addressed to us by the Ukrainian side and also, to a certain extent, by the media.



We behaved in such a way as a reliable member of NATO should behave — a member of NATO who does not want to expose NATO to any difficult situation. On the other hand, we, as members of NATO, also wanted and want to look for ways of support for the fight in Ukraine. And that is why we formulated statements, together with the Polish government — so myself as president, together with the Polish government.



And this statement or this declaration was announced by the Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs. It talked about the Polish possibilities — military possibilities of assisting Ukraine. Simply, we decided to put those jets at the disposal of NATO, not expecting anything in return, because we stressed very clearly that, as a gap filler for the donated equipment, we were able to buy something that we would need as a replacement. And we, ourselves, we’re ready to provide our equipment free of charge.



But we wanted NATO as a whole to make a common decision so that Poland remains a credible member of NATO, not a country who decides on its own on important issues which impact the security of NATO as a whole — which would impact the security of all members of NATO — also our neighbors who are part of NATO — members of NATO.



Thank you.



Another question?



POLISH AIDE: Maja Wójcikowska, TVN24.



Q Madam Vice President, each day we can see death and unimaginable suffering of the Ukraine people caused by decisions made by Vladimir Putin. My question is: Will the U.S. support an international investigation into war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine? And can you see any political future for Putin?



(As interpreted.) This is also the question to the Polish President.



VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Okay, I’ll go.



PRESIDENT DUDA: (Points to himself.)



VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: You go this time, please. (Laughs.)



Q (Inaudible) I will start with Madam Vice President.



VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: (Laughs.) Okay.



PRESIDENT DUDA: (Points to Vice President Harris.)



Q Thank you. I appreciate that. (Laughter.)



VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Not at all. I — we are very clear: The NATO Alliance is stronger and Russia is weaker because of what Putin has done. That is very clear to us.



And when it comes to crimes and violations of international norms and rules, we are also very clear that any intentional attack on innocent civilians is a violation. The U.N. has set up a process by which there will be a review and investigations, and we will of course participate as appropriate and necessary.



But we all watched the television coverage of just yesterday. That’s on top of everything else that we know and don’t know yet, based on what we’ve just been able to see. And because we’ve seen it or not doesn’t mean it hasn’t happened.



But just limited to what we have seen: Pregnant women going for healthcare being injured by — I don’t know — a missile, a bomb in an unprovoked, unjustified war, where a powerful country is trying to take over another country — violate its sovereignty, its territorial integrity, for the sake of what? Nothing that is justified or provoked. Absolutely there should be an investigation, and we should all be watching. And I have no question the eyes of the world are on this war and what Russia has done in terms of this aggression and these atrocities. I have no doubt.



PRESIDENT DUDA: (As interpreted.) It is obvious to us that in Ukraine, Russians are committing war crimes. I hope that also in the future it will be obvious for a court investigating those issues who bears responsibility for that.



Now, please remember that the refugees from Ukraine are coming to us right now. And right now, as we speak, there are people crossing our border who witnessed their houses destroyed, who saw their neighbors being killed, who saw hospitals being bombed, who saw civilians being shot at, children being shot at. These are proofs. These are the reports of witnesses, and they also have those proofs on their smartphones. If you look at those footages, it just makes your blood curl. Such scenes are happening today, and they have been happening over the last days in Ukraine, and their perpetrators are Russians.



A group of prosecutors has come to us delegated by the court to look at the facts of this case. They are collecting evidence. We, as Poland, try as much as we can to give them best — the best possible conditions for work and then to fulfill this very difficult task.



Let us remember, the witnesses are here. There is a lot of evidence — the footages as I mentioned. We have those proofs and the evidence. All of that is being collected. The work is ongoing. And I do believe that it is going to result in very serious indictment acts.



And I do believe that the war crimes — criminals will be sentenced — those responsible for the war that is happening in Ukraine right now as a result of this (inaudible) Russian assault.



WHITE HOUSE AIDE: And the final question will be from Asma Khalid of NPR.



Q Thank you. Thank you, Madam Vice President. I wanted to ask you about some reporting that my colleague here in Poland noticed. He recently spoke with the mayor of the largest border town, who told him that the refugee system is essentially not set up for this, that it will collapse. It’s an improvised system that can work for maybe two weeks, but not indefinitely. And I’m wondering what the United States is going to do more specifically to set up a permanent infrastructure. And relatedly, is the United States willing to make a specific allocation for Ukrainian refugees?



And for President Duda, I wanted to know if you think and if you asked the United States to specifically accept more refugees.



VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Okay. (Laughs.) A friend in need is a friend indeed. (Laughter.)



PRESIDENT DUDA: Okay. I’ll go first. Okay, so this time — (as interpreted) — Madam, the situation is very complex. This is what I was saying today and I discussed this at length with Madam Vice President Kamala Harris. I said, in a very blunt way, that today we are seeing a refugee crisis. It is unfolding because Poland is still able to receive — it is all the time able to find the accommodation for those people who are coming to us all the time.



But we have got almost 1,500,000 people who have come to us over the last couple of days. So it’s been 10 days. We have received more than 1 million people within 10 days. Never before have we witnessed such a situation. So this is something totally new to us, and we are grappling with this huge challenge. Our entire society is facing up to this challenge. I have already expressed my gratitude to the Polish people for their wonderful position in this very difficult situation — that they are so openhearted.



But we are aware that the problem is growing and that this problem is increasing. We have to somehow handle it, and we do not have the experience. Therefore, yesterday, I had a long conversation with Mr. António Guterres, Secretary General of the United Nations organization. And I flagged out that problem to him. I described to him the situation — how it looks, how it develops. I described to him the reaction of the Polish society, of the Polish authorities, how we have been handling with this problem. But I told him that unless we receive international assistance, then, given further influx of refugees to Poland on this scale, this will end up in a refugee disaster. And I asked for help — both the material assistance, financial assistance — so that we are able to solve this in Poland.



I also asked for expertise, for the know-how, because the U.N. has got experts who have seen a multitude crisis of this dimension, and I’m sure that they have worked out methods of how to handle it. And I’m sure they know how to solve the problems, which ensue due to such a crisis situation.



And this is something that I described in detail also today to Madam Vice President. I said that the assistance of the United States in this respect is invaluable to us, and we would be very much grateful if we could use this assistance as soon as possible.



Furthermore, we discussed the refugees from Ukraine who have got relatives and families in the United States, and who would be willing — at least for the time when the war is still waging, they would like to visit those families, to stay with their families in the United States, and to wait there until the war is over and then come back to their homes.



I asked to speed up and simplify the procedures for such people — the consular procedures to be simplified for those people who would like to leave for the United States, to give the opportunity to these people to see their families as soon as possible, to be reunited with their families, to help them to survive this time.



So we are acting, and we are looking for international support because, indeed, the vast majority of Ukrainian refugees are coming to our country. Frankly speaking, that is because, first of all, we are a big country. And also, the material status of an ordinary citizen of Poland is for sure much better than the material status, the living conditions of an ordinary Ukrainian citizen, although we are not among those wealthy countries of Western Europe, but our living standards have increased over the last couple of years in Poland.



But they are coming because I believe that also the — it is their belief that thanks to the presence of NATO armed forces, thanks to the presence of our Allies from NATO — from Canada, from the UK, from Romania, and from other countries whose soldiers are deployed in Poland — they believe that Poland, due to that presence, is a safe country, a country which is not going to be attacked, a country where you can safely wait out this difficult situation.



VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: As the President said, we did discuss this issue. And I started by thanking the President in Poland and the people of Poland for what they have done. And I will restate what I said earlier this afternoon: They’ve shown extraordinary generosity and kindness and courage. And they have — there have been some here who have relatives who have arrived from Ukraine, but I think there are many more who are taking in perfect strangers with barely a lot to give but giving a lot nonetheless.



So, we recognize that, and we recognize the burden that it places on the government of Poland, on the president, and the infrastructure of this country; when you look at — as the President said, over one and a half million people coming within two weeks, virtually. Unprecedented if you track and look at refugee flows over the history of time from regions of conflict.



So the United States is absolutely prepared to do what we can and what we must to support Poland in terms of the burden that they have taken on that I think all of us who understand the moral obligation we should feel to help people who are fleeing harm and seeking refuge; the burden we should all be prepared to take on to support those people who are fleeing their home when they don’t want to leave.



In terms of what we are doing in the United States, we will then take this in terms of what we can do to support and look at those Ukrainians who want to come to the United States. What we’re seeing thus far is large parts of that population who are fleeing Ukraine, who desire to stay in Europe.



You probably know that we have made a decision as it relates to TPS — the Temporary Protected Status. So for Ukrainians that are in the United States whose visa may expire or has expired: If they were in the United States before — I believe it’s March; I don’t have the exact date — they will be able to stay; they won’t be required to leave, even though their visa has expired because, of course, we would not send them back to what is a warzone.



And the bottom line is that I have stated the position to the President this afternoon. As we have said many times through our work collectively in the U.N., through NATO, we will support Poland in terms of the burden it is facing and our collective responsibility to ensure the safety and wellbeing of these refugees.



POLISH AIDE: (As interpreted.) This concludes our press conference. Thank you very much for your participation, ladies and gentlemen.



VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Thank you.

1,34a0a378-3d9b-4437-9451-dd7319910753,[],,"Harris says US commitment to NATO is 'ironclad' as she aims to reassure its Romanian allies

Vice President Kamala Harris ventured farther toward NATO's eastern edge Friday with a stop in Romania, a country suddenly thrust into priority position for the United States as fighting rages over its border in Ukraine.

By Kevin Liptak, CNN

(CNN) -- Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday described the United States' commitment to defending NATO members as ironclad during remarks following a meeting with the Romanian President as she looks to reassure allies along NATO's eastern edge.

""We take very seriously our role and the relationships that we have within the NATO alliance,"" Harris said at a joint news conference with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis. ""We take seriously and are prepared to act on the words we speak when we say an attack against one is an attack against all.""

""We are firm in our commitment,"" she added. ""When I say and we say over and over again, President Joe Biden says: We will defend every inch of NATO territory.""

Harris said responding to the Russian invasion of Ukraine means reaffirming the NATO commitment, and said, ""America's commitment to Article 5 is ironclad. We take very seriously our role and the relationships that we have within the NATO alliance."" Article 5 is the principle that an attack on one NATO member is an attack on all the nations in the alliance.

""We are clear that the work that is to be done in response to Putin's war includes standing strong within the alliance to support the needs of our partners,"" she said.

Harris hailed Romania's support for Ukrainian refugees, saying the humanitarian needs are ""significant and immediate.""

She said the US would commit more funding to help alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Europe.

Harris met with Iohannis on Friday afternoon on her second and final stop on her trip to Europe. She is set to return to Washington later in the day.

In short remarks ahead of their sit-down talks, Harris and Iohannis said they wished they could be meeting under difference circumstances.

""Difficult times,"" Iohannis observed. ""Your visit here gives us strength and is living proof of our strong partnership.""

Harris said reaffirming US commitment to Romania and NATO was the reason for her trip, which is the highest-ranking visit to the region since the war in Ukraine began.

""That is why I am here,"" she said. ""To reaffirm our commitment to this partnership, to the friendship and also to the NATO alliance as a whole and everything that the United States has been and is prepared to do going forward, it terms of the strength of that relationship and its endurance.""

Her trip has been a test both of her diplomatic abilities and the resolve of the broader Western allies to forcefully confront Russian President Vladimir Putin for launching the largest ground invasion in Europe since World War II.

Biden has already dispatched 1,000 troops to Romania and pledged support for the country as it accommodates a major influx of migrants fleeing the war next door. But a visit by his number two is meant to demonstrate American commitment at a deeply uncertain moment for the region.

Unlike Ukraine, Romania is a member of NATO, and an attack on the country by Russia would trigger the alliance's collective defense treaty, which says an attack on one is an attack on all.

But even the protection of NATO, a system of alliance bases and a missile defense system can't entirely calm nerves in this former Soviet satellite state that's been invaded by Russia repeatedly over the course of its history.

European anxiety over Putin's next steps were on display in Bucharest, when Harris was asked what the chances are of the war extending into Romania.

""As it relates to what might be the future conduct of Putin, I cannot speculate,"" Harris said. ""But we are clear in our position, which is that as a member of NATO, an attack against one is an attack against all.""

Iohannis sought to downplay fears that Putin could have his sights set on Romania next.

""We do not have information that Romania would represent a target of aggression,"" he said, through a translator. ""On the other hand it is very clear it is very clear that this Russian action, this war started against Ukraine, definitely created a difficult to produce result, a visible firm, a clear result. And it's represented by the unity of NATO.""

Even as Russia and Ukraine engage in halting talks aimed at ending the war, Harris said Putin isn't interested in ""serious diplomacy."" She said the United States is committed to finding a diplomatic solution, but didn't sound optimistic that Moscow was currently seeking one.

""From the beginning, the United States has been attempting sincerely to engage in diplomacy,"" she said. ""From everything that we know and have witnessed, Putin shows no sign of engaging in serious diplomacy.""

She said Russia was engaging in ""lies"" and ""misinformation,"" a playbook she said the US had long identified, and added that as efforts at diplomacy proceed, Russia should be held accountable for its actions.

""We maintain that diplomacy is the way to resolve these issues,"" she said, saying that should ""coexist with our commitment to ensure that our alliances are strong, and that there must be serious consequence and accountability for what Russia is doing.""

Harris on a critical diplomatic trip

Harris arrived in Bucharest from Poland, where she reinforced American commitment to another NATO ally that is watching warily for Putin's next move. She met with American and Polish troops Friday morning and said the US was committed to protecting ""every inch"" of NATO territory.

""The United States is prepared to defend every inch of NATO territory. The United States takes seriously that an attack against one is an attack against all,"" Harris said after meeting President Andrzej Duda in Warsaw.

She announced the US had fulfilled a delivery of Patriot missiles to Poland and promised to support the country as it grapples with its own surge of migrants, which has strained public resources, despite an overwhelming welcome from the Polish people.

Still, her visit also underscored the limits to American or NATO willingness to protect civilians in Ukraine. A plan that had been considered to supply Ukraine with Polish fighter jets was deemed impossible by the Pentagon before she arrived, and she offered little indication it may be revived in the future.

Instead, Harris underscored the military support the United States is already providing Ukraine short of air power, including anti-tank missiles, which the country's president, Volodomyr Zelensky, has deemed insufficient.

""We're making deliveries every day in terms of what we can do,"" Harris said. Asked what more Ukraine could expect, she said, ""That is an ongoing process and that is not going to stop to the extent there is a need.""

Harris also amplified atrocities that she said are underway in Ukraine, though she stopped short of calling them war crimes. She called on the United Nations to investigate.

In Bucharest, her answer to a similar question was brisk.

""We are clear that any intentional attack or targeting of civilians is a war crime. Period,"" she said.

The administration has said that before an official designation on war crimes can be made, an investigation must proceed. But officials have been clear that Russia is targeting civilians, and made plain they believe such an action would constitute a war crime.

An official traveling with the vice president said her visit was intended as more than mere symbolism, designed to show the US was putting its ""money where its mouth is"" by sending additional troops to NATO's eastern reaches.

But the official also acknowledged that Harris' brand of reassurance diplomacy gained more significance because Biden is intent on avoiding direct conflict with Russia.

""The President's been pretty clear about not engaging in direct military conflict with Russia, not putting troops into Ukraine, but he's also been pretty clear ... about our determination to make Russia pay a price for that and to continue to provide assistance to Ukraine,"" the official said. ""And that's why the vice president is here to make sure that we can do that in an effective way. And I think she has been very effective in doing it.""

2,34a0a378-3d9b-4437-9451-dd7319910753,"['Aamer Madhani', 'Associated Press']",2022-03-10 09:17:47-04:00,"WARSAW, Poland (AP) — U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday embraced calls for an international war crimes investigation of Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, citing the “atrocities” of bombing civilians, including a maternity hospital.

Speaking alongside Polish President Andrzej Duda at a press conference in Warsaw, where she is demonstrating U.S. support for NATO’s eastern flank allies, Harris expressed outrage over the bombing Wednesday of the maternity hospital and scenes of bloodied pregnant women being evacuated, as well as other attacks on civilians. She stopped short of directly accusing Russia of having committed war crimes.

“Absolutely there should be an investigation, and we should all be watching,” said Harris, noting that the United Nations has already started a process to review allegations. “I have no question the eyes of the world are on this war and what Russia has done in terms of this aggression and these atrocities.”

WATCH: Russian shelling of civilian targets causes day of carnage across Ukraine

Duda, for his part, said “it is obvious to us that in Ukraine Russians are committing war crimes.” He added that in his view the invasion was “bearing the features of a genocide — it aims at eliminating and destroying a nation.”

Harris praised the Polish people for their generosity for taking in nearly 1.5 million refugees since Russia invaded Ukraine last month.

“I’ve been watching or reading about the work of ordinary people doing extraordinary things, and so I bring you thanks from the American people,” Harris said earlier during a meeting with Polish

Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki hours after the U.S. House passed a massive spending bill that includes $13.6 billion in aid for Ukraine and its European allies.

The legislation includes $6.8 billion to care for refugees and other economic aid to allies.

Harris also met Thursday afternoon with Ukrainian refugees who have fled to Poland since the Russian invasion began. She praised the refugees for their “courage” and said the conversation would help inform U.S. assistance efforts.

The vice president is also scheduled to meet with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau while in Warsaw. The Canadian leader has been in Europe in recent days meeting with allies about Ukraine.

Harris’ whirlwind visit to Poland and Romania was billed by the White House as a chance for the vice president to consult with two of the leaders from eastern flank NATO nations about the growing humanitarian crisis caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Already, more than 2 million refugees have fled Ukraine — with more than half coming to Poland — and even more expected to arrive in the days ahead.

Duda warned of a “refugee disaster” if Poland doesn’t receive more assistance to help house and feed Ukrainians fleeing the conflict. He said he asked Harris for the U.S. to “speed up” the process for those Ukrainian refugees who would want to go to the U.S. and might have family there.

“The United States is absolutely prepared to do what we can and what we must to support Poland, in terms of the burden that they have taken on,” said Harris.

But differences between Warsaw and Washington over a Polish plan to send Soviet-made fighter jets to a base in Germany for Ukraine’s use have cast a shadow over Harris’ visit to Poland. Just as Harris arrived in Warsaw late Wednesday evening, the Pentagon definitively rejected the idea.

The proposal was publicly floated by Poland — without first consulting the U.S. — days after Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Biden administration was “very, very actively” looking at a proposal under which Ukraine’s neighbor Poland would supply Kyiv with Soviet-era fighters and in turn receive American F-16s to make up for their loss. Polish government officials, however, insisted any transfer of planes must be done within the NATO framework.

“In a nutshell we have to be a responsible member of the North Atlantic Alliance,” said Duda.

On Wednesday, the Pentagon shut the door on the prospect of NATO transferring jets to Ukraine, saying such a move with a U.S. and NATO connection would run a “high risk” of escalating the Russia-Ukraine war.

Harris, in her remarks, brushed aside any notion of tensions between Poland and the U.S. over how to effectively support Ukraine. “I want to be very clear, the United States and Poland are united in what we have done and are prepared to do to help Ukraine and the people of Ukraine, full stop,” she said.

Gen. Tod D. Wolters, the commander of U.S. European Command, said in a statement Thursday that the “most effective way to support the Ukrainian military in their fight against Russia is to provide increased amounts of anti-tank weapons and air defense systems.” That effort by the U.S. and allies is ongoing, Wolters added.

Harris will travel on Friday to Bucharest, where she’s to meet Romanian President Klaus Iohannis.

Taking her first question from a Romanian journalist, Harris was asked what the chances are of the war between Russia and Ukraine extending into Romania, a former Soviet satellite state that's been invaded by Russia repeatedly over the course of its history.

""As it relates to what might be the future conduct of Putin, I cannot speculate,"" Harris said.

It was as clear an indication as any that the endgame to Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion remains an open question, leaving countries like Romania anxiously wonder what his next move will be. American officials privately acknowledge the withering sanctions applied by the West -- including new economic moves announced on Friday -- aren't likely to change his calculus.

After Russian and Ukrainian leaders engaged in halting talks over the past week, Harris appeared skeptical of diplomatic efforts underway.

""From the beginning, the United States has been attempting sincerely to engage in diplomacy,"" she said. ""From everything that we know and have witnessed, Putin shows no sign of engaging in serious diplomacy.""

And she acknowledged the pain tough economic sanctions might mean for Americans, though couldn't say when the burden would be lifted.

""There is a price to pay for democracy,"" she said. ""Got to stand with your friends.""

Harris met with President Klaus Iohannis on Friday afternoon on her second and final stop on her trip to Europe. She is set to return to Washington later in the day.

In short remarks ahead of their sit-down talks, Harris and Iohannis both said they wished they could be meeting under different circumstances.

What You Need To Know In Poland on Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris reiterated the United States’ commitment to protecting its NATO allies against Russian aggression amid Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine



She also called for an international war crimes investigation of the Kremlin



Harris commended Poland for taking in about 1.5 million Ukrainian refugees and announced that the U.S. is donating an additional $53 million to assist with humanitarian aid



Citing Wednesday’s bombing that destroyed a children’s and maternity hospital in the port city of Mariupol, Ukraine, killing at least three people and wounding 17 others, Harris said Russia has committed “atrocities of unimaginable proportion""

“I am here in Poland as an expression of the enduring and important relationship between the United States and Poland,” Harris said in a joint news conference with Polish President Andrzej Duda after their meeting. “That, again, has been longstanding, but in particular on the issue of Ukraine, is unified and is clear: We will do everything together in partnership, in solidarity to support what is necessary at this very moment in terms of the humanitarian and security needs of Ukraine and the Ukrainian people.”

The U.S. is not directly involved in the war in Ukraine, but has given more than $1.2 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since President Joe Biden took office last year.

The U.S., however, has deployed thousands of troops to reinforce NATO’s eastern flank, including an additional 4,700 service members sent to Poland. Harris said the U.S. also has delivered two Patriot missile defense systems to Warsaw.

“The United States’ commitment to Article 5 is ironclad,” Harris said. “The United States is prepared to defend every inch of NATO territory. The United States takes seriously that an attack against one is an attack against all. We are here today to restate that commitment.”

Harris commended Poland for taking in about 1.5 million Ukrainian refugees and announced that the U.S. is donating an additional $53 million to assist with humanitarian aid.

“We will continue with the support that we can give you, Mr. President, in terms of the work that you and the people of Poland have been doing to bear this burden, but in a way that really has been with such grace and such generosity,” Harris said.

She also noted that the House of Representatives approved a funding bill that includes $13.6 billion in aid to help Ukraine, some of which would be distributed to other countries taking in refugees. The Senate must still approve the legislation before sending it to Biden’s desk.

“When we talk about humanitarian aid, it is because, yes, the assistance is necessary, but what compels us also is the moral outrage that all civilized nations feel when we look at what is happening to innocent men, women, children, grandmothers, grandfathers, who are fleeing everything they've known,” Harris said. “Our outrage, which compels not only our security assistance but our humanitarian assistance, is rooted in the fact that also we support the people of Ukraine who have shown extraordinary courage and skill in their willingness and, yes, ability to fight against Putin’s war and Russia's aggression.”

Duda called Harris’ visit to Warsaw “a very clear political message where the most important things are happening today.”

“We have to rescue Ukraine,” the Polish president said. “All of us are acutely aware of that. All hands should be on board. Ukraine needs to be helped, and we have to stay united in that respect.”

Citing Wednesday’s bombing that destroyed a children’s and maternity hospital in the port city of Mariupol, Ukraine, killing at least three people and wounding 17 others, Harris said Russia has committed “atrocities of unimaginable proportion.”

Asked if the U.S. would support an international investigation into whether Russia has committed war crimes, the vice president said “absolutely.”

“When it comes to crimes and violations of international norms and rules, we are also very clear than any intentional attack on innocent civilians is a violation,” said Harris, who stopped short of explicitly accusing Russia of war crimes.

“Pregnant women going for health care being injured by, I don't know, a missile, a bomb in an unprovoked, unjustified war where a powerful country is trying to take over another country, violate its sovereignty, its territorial integrity for the sake of, what, nothing that is justified or provoked — absolutely, there should be an investigation,” she said. “And we should all be watching, and I have no question the eyes of the world are on this war and what Russia has done in terms of this aggression and these atrocities.”

Duda said, “It is obvious to us that in Ukraine Russians are committing war crimes.”

The meeting between Harris and Duda came amid a public communication breakdown between the two countries over a Polish plan to supply MiG-29 planes to Ukraine. The U.S. had entertained the idea of replacing Poland’s planes with F-16s.

The Polish government on Tuesday announced a plan to transfer its Russian-made fighter planes to a U.S. military base in Germany, with the expectation that the planes would then be handed over to Ukrainian pilots trying to fend off Russian forces.

But the Poles didn't run that idea past the Biden administration before going public with it, and the Pentagon quickly dismissed the idea as not tenable.

On Wednesday, Gen. Tod D. Wolters, the top U.S. military commander in Europe, thanked Poland for its offer but said that sending the planes to Ukraine would be a “high-risk and low-gain” venture.

Wolters said the most effective way to support the Ukrainian military “is to provide increased amounts of anti-tank weapons and air defense systems.”

Wolters says Ukraine already has enough warplanes and that sending the planes “may be mistaken as escalatory and could result in Russian escalation with NATO … producing a high-risk scenario.”

Asked about the situation during Thursday’s news conference, Harris did not directly address it, but said, “The United States and Poland are united in what we have done and are prepared to do to help Ukraine and the people of Ukraine.”

Duda said Poland had offered to donate the planes to NATO for the alliance to determine how they might be used. He insisted Poland was not acting unilaterally, but as a “reliable member of NATO.” He added that Poland did not expect anything in return for the planes.

More than 40 Republican U.S. senators on Thursday called for President Biden to aid “the transfer of aircraft and air defense systems” to Ukraine after officials quashed Poland’s offer to send fighter jets with American help. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The senators said in a letter that they “strongly disagree” with the Biden administration’s stance on Poland’s proposal, and that the Ukrainian military is in “dire need of more lethal aid” as it fights Russia’s invasion. They urged the president to work with NATO allies on providing those resources — uniting behind a step that U.S. officials worry could pull the Western alliance into war.

American officials have criticized Poland’s proposal to transfer MiG-29 jets through the United States as risking escalation without significantly changing the situation in Ukraine, given that Ukraine’s air force is largely intact. Asked about the senator’s letter Thursday evening, White House spokesperson Sean Savett noted comments from the Pentagon and the U.S. military commander in Europe expressing those views.

The GOP lawmakers’ letter increases pressure on the Biden administration to go further and underscores the party’s support for major actions against the Kremlin. The White House announced a ban on Russian oil and natural gas imports this week with bipartisan support, and Congress passed a multibillion-dollar aid package for Ukraine that would provide military and humanitarian support and help NATO allies.

“Supporting Ukraine’s fight for freedom against the tyrannical, lawless Russian invasion of Ukraine’s sovereign territory is among the most urgent missions the West has faced in a generation,” begins the senators’ letter, which includes the signature of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky).

“We implore you to direct your Department of Defense to facilitate the transfer of aircraft, air defense systems, and other capabilities by and through our NATO partners immediately,” the senators wrote.

Speaking earlier at a news conference, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) dismissed concerns about provoking Russia and said the United States should fulfill a specific request from Ukraine. “It’s time … for [Putin] to fear what we might do,"" Romney said, referring to the United States and NATO.

Many nations have responded to Russia’s invasion with sanctions, but they have been unwilling to join Ukraine’s fight with a superpower. The United States is wary of military aid that Russia could interpret as more direct involvement in the war.

The Pentagon on Thursday ruled out sending its Patriot missile defense system to Ukraine, with a senior U.S. defense official saying the system is unfamiliar to Ukrainians and would require U.S. troops on the ground.

Poland blindsided American leaders this week by saying it would give MiG-29 jets to the United States for use in the war. In a statement, Poland said it was ready to deploy the planes to an American military facility in Germany “immediately and free of charge.”

The United States quickly rejected the idea: “We do not believe Poland’s proposal is a tenable one,” Pentagon’s spokesman John Kirby said. He said such jets “departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance.”

Gen. Tod D. Wolters, the commander of U.S. European Command, took a similar view in a statement released Thursday.

“We believe the most effective way to support the Ukrainian military in their fight against Russia is to provide increased amounts of anti-tank weapons and air defense systems, which is on-going with the international community,” Wolters said in the statement.

Vice President Harris on Thursday met with Polish President Andrzej Duda and sought to downplay the disagreement over the MiG-29 jets, saying the American relationship with Poland and NATO remains strong.

Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said last week that he would work to grant Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s “desperate plea” for planes from countries in Eastern Europe. Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote a letter Monday, urging quick coordination with Poland to “provide Soviet-era jets to Ukraine.” He said the United States and NATO allies should commit to replacing donated aircraft.

Those comments came before Poland’s proposal that its Russian-made MiG-29 jets be placed “at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America"" and go to Ramstein Air Base, an American facility in Germany.

Thursday’s letter from GOP lawmakers sharpens a contrast between their posture on Ukraine and comments last month from former president Donald Trump, who called Putin’s actions in separatist regions of Ukraine “genius” while repeating the Russian president’s claims of sending a “peacekeeper” force.

Speaking more recently to top GOP donors, Trump struck a different tone, rejecting suggestions that he is a “Putin apologist” and mocking Biden for ruling out military engagement with Russia.
