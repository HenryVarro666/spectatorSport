From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily.

[music]

Today: Russia is making preparations for what many fear may be a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, prompting warnings from the U.S. of serious consequences if it does. I spoke to my colleague, Moscow bureau chief Anton Troianovski, about what Vladimir Putin wants from Ukraine and just how far he may go to get it. It’s Wednesday, December 8. Anton, describe the scene right now on the border between Ukraine and Russia. What does it look like? What exactly is happening there?

anton troianovski

Well, what you’re seeing on the Russian side of the border within 100 to 200 miles away is that thousands of Russian troops are on the move.

archived recording 1 A top military official says intelligence shows nearly 100,000 Russian troops — archived recording 2 Russian troops have massed on the border of Ukraine. archived recording 3 — troops on the border with Ukraine. And that’s prompted fears of an invasion early next year.

anton troianovski

We’re seeing a lot of social media footage of tanks and other military equipment on the move, on trains, in some cases, heading west toward the Ukraine border area from as far away as Siberia.

archived recording Tensions between Russia and Ukraine have been building for some time in the wake of —

anton troianovski

These satellite images that we’re seeing show deployment areas around Ukraine that were empty as recently as June that are now full of military equipment-like tanks and armored personnel carriers.

archived recording The U.S. called it unusual activity.

anton troianovski

And obviously, Russia moves its forces all the time. It does big military exercises, snap military exercises all the time, but what we’re being told is that these military movements are very unusual. Some of them are happening at night and, in other ways, seemingly designed to obfuscate where various units are going. And experts are saying we’re also seeing things like logistics and medical equipment being moved around, stuff that you really would see if there were real preparations being made for large-scale military action.

michael barbaro

So what’s happening in Russia is not just the movement of the troops that would perhaps carry out an invasion, but the kind of military personnel and equipment that would be required to deal with the repercussions of something like invading Ukraine?

anton troianovski

Yes. So American intelligence officials are seeing intelligence that shows Russia preparing for a military offensive involving an estimated 175,000 troops —

michael barbaro

Wow.

anton troianovski

— as soon as early next year.

michael barbaro

And Anton, is Ukraine preparing for what certainly looks, from what you just described, as a potential invasion?

anton troianovski

They’re in a really tough spot because no matter how much they prepare, their military would be utterly outgunned and outmatched. Ukraine doesn’t have the missile defense and air defense systems that could prevent a huge shock-and-awe campaign at the beginning of Russian military action. They also don’t know, if and when an attack comes, which direction it might come from, because Russia could attack from any of three directions. So we’re not seeing a big mobilization in Ukraine right now, but our reporting on the ground there does show a grim and determined mood among the military. The soldiers on the border have made it clear that if it comes to it, they will be prepared to do what they can to make this as costly as possible for the other side.

michael barbaro

So I guess the question everyone has in this moment is why would Putin want to invade Ukraine right now and touch off what would no doubt be a major conflict, one in which, as you just said, Russia would have many advantages, but would nevertheless end up probably being a very deadly conflict?

anton troianovski

So obviously, we don’t yet know whether Putin has made the decision to invade. He’s clearly signaling he’s prepared to use military force. What we do know is that he has been extraordinarily fixated on the issue of Ukraine for years. But I think to really understand it, you have to look at three dates over the last 30 years that really show us why Ukraine matters so much to Putin.

michael barbaro

OK. So what’s the first date?

anton troianovski

The first one, 1991, almost exactly 30 years ago, the Soviet Union breaks up, and Ukraine becomes an independent country. For people of Putin’s generation, this was an incredibly shocking and even traumatic moment. Not only did they see and experience the collapse of an empire, of the country that they grew up in, that they worked in, that, in Putin’s case, the former K.G.B. officer that they served. But there was also a specific trauma of Ukraine breaking away. Ukraine, of all the former Soviet republics, was probably the one most valuable to Moscow. It was a matter of history and identity with, in many ways, Russian statehood originating out of the medieval Kiev Rus civilization. There’s the matter of culture with so many Russian language writers like Gogol and Bulgakov coming from Ukraine. There was the matter of economics with Ukraine being an industrial and agricultural powerhouse during the Soviet Union, with many of the planes and missiles that the Soviets were most proud of coming from Ukraine.

michael barbaro

So there’s a sense that Ukraine is the cradle of Russian civilization, and to lose it is to lose a part of Russia itself.

anton troianovski

Yeah. And it’s a country of tens of millions of people that is also sandwiched between modern-day Russia and Western Europe. So the other issue is geopolitical, that Ukraine in that sort of Cold War security, East-versus-West mindset, Ukraine was a buffer between Moscow and the West. So 1991 was the year when that all fell apart. And then by the time that Putin comes to power 10 years later, he’s already clearly thinking about how to reestablish Russian influence in that former Soviet space in Eastern Europe and in Ukraine in particular. We saw a lot of resources go in economically to try to bind Ukraine to Russia, whether it’s discounts on natural gas or other efforts by Russian companies, efforts to build ties to politicians and oligarchs in Ukraine. Really, a multipronged effort by Putin and the Kremlin to really gain as much influence as possible in that former Soviet space that they saw as being so key to Russia’s economic and security interests.

michael barbaro

Got it.

anton troianovski

And then fast forward to the second key date, 2014, which is the year it became clear that that strategy had failed.

archived recording Now, to the growing unrest in Ukraine and the violent clashes between riot police and protesters.

michael barbaro

And why did that strategy fail in 2014?

anton troianovski

That was the year that Ukraine had its — what’s called its Maidan Revolution.

archived recording 1 The situation in Kiev has been very tense. archived recording 2 Downtown Kiev has been turned into a charred battlefield following two straight nights of rioting.

anton troianovski

It’s a pro-Western revolution —

archived recording They want nothing short of revolution, a new government and a new president.

anton troianovski

— that drove out a Russia-friendly president, that ushered in a pro-Western government, that made it its mission to reduce Ukraine’s ties with Russia and build its ties with the West.

archived recording Ukrainians who want closer ties with the West are once again back in their thousands on Independence Square here in Kiev. They believe they —

michael barbaro

Hmm. And what was Putin’s response to that?

anton troianovski

Well, Putin didn’t even see it as a revolution. He saw it as a coup engineered by the C.I.A. and other Western intelligence agencies meant to drive Ukraine away from Russia. And —

archived recording With stealth and mystery, Vladimir Putin made his move in Ukraine.

anton troianovski

— he used his military.

archived recording At dawn, bands of armed men appeared at the two main airports in Crimea and seized control.

anton troianovski

He sent troops into Crimea, the Ukrainian Peninsula in the Black Sea that’s so dear to people across the former Soviet Union as kind of the warmest, most tropical place in a very cold part of the world.

archived recording Tonight, Russian troops — hundreds, perhaps as many as 2,000, ferried in transport planes — have landed at the airports.

anton troianovski

He fomented a separatist war in Eastern Ukraine that by now has taken more than 10,000 lives and armed and backed pro-Russian separatists in that region. So that was the year 2014 when Russia’s earlier efforts to try to bind Ukraine to Moscow failed and when Russia started taking a much harder line.

michael barbaro

And this feels like a very pivotal moment because it shows Putin’s willingness to deploy the Russian military to strengthen the ties between Russia and Ukraine.

anton troianovski

Absolutely. Strengthened the ties or you can also say his efforts to enforce a Russian sphere of influence by military force. And it’s also the start of what we’ve been seeing ever since, which is Putin making it clear that he is willing to escalate, he is willing to raise the stakes and that he essentially cares more about the fate of Ukraine than the West does. And that brings us to the third date I wanted to talk about, which is early this year, 2021, when we saw the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, really start taking a more aggressive anti-Russian and pro-Western tack. He cracked down on a pro-Russian oligarch and pro-Russian media. He continued with military exercises with American soldiers and with other Western forces. He kept talking up the idea of Ukraine joining NATO. That’s the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Western military alliance. And in a sense, this is what Putin seems to fear the most, the idea of NATO becoming more entrenched in this region. So Putin made it clear that this was starting to cross what he describes as Russia’s red lines and that Russia was willing to take action to stop this.

michael barbaro

So to put this all together and understand why Putin is doing what he’s doing when it comes to Ukraine, we have as a backdrop here this fixation with Ukraine for historic, political, economic and cultural reasons. And what’s new and urgent here for Putin is his belief that Ukraine is on the verge of a major break with Russia and toward the West — in particular, a military alliance, NATO — and that he cannot tolerate. And so that brings us up to now and this very imminent and scary threat of a Russian invasion.

anton troianovski

That’s right, Michael. I spoke to a former advisor of Putin’s recently who described Ukraine as a trauma within a trauma for the Kremlin — so the trauma of the breakup of the Soviet Union plus the trauma of losing Ukraine specifically for all those reasons you mentioned. And the thing is it’s true. Russia is losing Ukraine. I think objectively, though, you have to say it’s losing Ukraine in large part because of Putin’s policies, because of the aggressive actions he’s taken. And if you look at the polls before 2014, something like 12 percent of Ukrainians wanted to join NATO. Now, it’s more than half.

michael barbaro

Wow.

anton troianovski

So you put all that together, Ukraine is indeed drifting toward the West. It does seem like Putin feels like he’s running out of time to stop this and that he’s willing to escalate, he’s willing to raise the stakes, to keep Ukraine out of the West. And what we’re seeing right now on the border is all that playing out.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. So Anton, the question right now is will President Putin actually carry out an invasion of Ukraine? And how should we be thinking about that?

anton troianovski

Well, it’s quite perilous, of course, to try to get inside Putin’s head, but here’s the case for invading now. Number one: NATO and the United States have made it clear that they are not going to come to Ukraine’s defense, because Ukraine is not a member of the NATO alliance, and NATO’s mutual defense pact only extends to full-fledged members. And of course, I think, politically, Putin believes that neither in the U.S., nor in Western Europe, is there the will to see soldiers from those countries die fighting for Ukraine.

michael barbaro

Right. And President Biden has just very publicly pulled the United States out of the war in Afghanistan and more or less communicated that unless American national security interests are at play, he will not be dispatching troops anywhere.

anton troianovski

Exactly. So Putin saw that, and he sees that potentially things could change. If the West does have more of a military presence in Ukraine in the future, let alone if Ukraine were to become a member of NATO at some point — it’s not going to happen in the next few years, but perhaps at some point — then attacking Ukraine becomes a much more costly proposition. So it’s a matter of war now could be less costly to Russia than war later.

michael barbaro

Right. The geopolitics of this moment may work in favor of him doing it in a way that it might not in a year or two or three.

anton troianovski

Absolutely. And then there’s a couple of other reasons. There’s the fact that if we look at everything Putin has said and written over the last year, he really seems convinced that the West is pulling Ukraine away from Russia against the will of much of the Ukrainian people. Polling doesn’t really bear that out, but Putin really seems to be convinced of that. And so it seems like he may also be thinking that Ukrainians would welcome Russian forces as liberators from some kind of Western occupation. And then third, there’s the economy. The West has already threatened severe sanctions against Russia were it to go ahead with military action, but Russia has been essentially sanctions-proofing its economy since at least 2014, which is when it took control of Crimea and was hit by all these sanctions from the U.S. and from the E.U. So Russia’s economy is still tied to the West. It imports a lot of stuff from the West. But in many key areas, whether it’s technology or energy extraction or agriculture, Russia is becoming more self-sufficient. And it is building ties to other parts of the world — like China, India, et cetera — that could allow it to diversify and have basically an economic base even if an invasion leads to a major crisis in its financial and economic relationship with the West.

michael barbaro

Right. So this is the argument that Putin can live with the costs of the world reacting very negatively to this invasion?

anton troianovski

Exactly.

michael barbaro

OK. And what are the reasons why an invasion of Ukraine might not happen? What would be the case against it, if you were Vladimir Putin?

anton troianovski

Well, I mean, I have to say, talking to analysts, especially here in Russia, people are very skeptical that Putin would go ahead with an invasion. They point out that he is a careful tactician and that he doesn’t like making moves that are irreversible or that could have unpredictable consequences. So if we even look at the military action he’s taken recently, the annexation of Crimea, there wasn’t a single shot fired in that. That was a very quick special-forces-type operation. What we’re talking about here, an invasion of Ukraine, would be just a massive escalation from anything Putin has done so far. We are talking about the biggest land war in Europe since World War II, most likely. And it would have all kinds of unpredictable consequences. There’s also the domestic situation to keep in mind. Putin does still have approval ratings above 60 percent, but things are a bit shaky here, especially with Covid. And some analysts say that Putin wouldn’t want to usher in the kind of domestic unpredictability that could start with a major war with young men coming back in body bags. And then finally, looking at Putin’s strategy and everything that he’s said, for all we know, he doesn’t really want to annex Ukraine. He wants influence over Ukraine. And the way he thinks he can do that is through negotiations with the United States. And that’s where the last key point here comes in, which is Putin’s real conviction that it’s the U.S. pulling the strings here and that he can accomplish his goals by getting President Biden to sit down with him and hammering out a deal about the structure of security in Eastern Europe. So in that sense, this whole troop build-up might not be about an impending invasion at all. It might just be about coercive diplomacy, getting the U.S. to the table, and getting them to hammer out an agreement that would somehow pledge to keep Ukraine out of NATO and pledge to keep Western military infrastructure out of Ukraine and parts of the Black Sea.

michael barbaro

Well in that sense, Anton, Putin may be getting what he wants, right? Because as we speak, President Putin and President Biden have just wrapped up a very closely watched phone call about all of this. So is it possible that that call produces a breakthrough and perhaps a breakthrough that goes Putin’s way?

anton troianovski

Well, that’s very hard to imagine. And that’s really what makes this situation so volatile and so dangerous, which is that what Putin wants, the West and President Biden can’t really give.

michael barbaro

Why not?

anton troianovski

Well, for instance, pledging to keep Ukraine out of NATO would violate the Western concept that every country should have the right to decide for itself what its alliances are. President Biden obviously has spent years, going back to when he was vice president, really speaking in favor of Ukrainian sovereignty and self-determination and trying to help Ukraine take a more Western path. So Biden suddenly turning on all of that and giving Putin what he wants here is hard to imagine.

michael barbaro

Right, because that would create a very slippery slope when it comes to any country that Russia wants to have influence over. It would then know that the right playbook would be to mass troops on the border and wait for negotiation with the U.S. and hope that the U.S. would basically sell those countries out. That’s probably not something you’re saying that President Biden would willingly do.

anton troianovski

Right. And then, of course, the other question is, well, if Russia doesn’t get what it wants, if Putin doesn’t get what he wants, then what does he do?

michael barbaro

So Anton, it’s tempting to think that this could all be what you just described as a coercive diplomatic bluff by Putin to extract what he wants from President Biden and from the West. But it feels like history has taught us that Putin is willing to invade Ukraine. He did it in 2014. History has also taught us that he’s obsessed with Ukraine, dating back to 1991 and the end of the Soviet Union. And it feels like one of the ultimate lessons of history is that we have to judge leaders based on their actions. And his actions right now are putting 175,000 troops near the border with Ukraine. And so shouldn’t we conclude that it very much looks like Putin might carry out this invasion?

anton troianovski

Yes, that’s right. And of course, there are steps that Putin could take that would be short of a full-fledged invasion that could still be really destabilizing and damaging. Here in Moscow, I’ve heard analysts speculate about maybe pinpoint airstrikes against the Ukrainian targets, or a limited invasion perhaps just specifically in that area where Russian-backed separatists are fighting. But even such steps could have really grave consequences. And that’s why if you combine what we’re seeing on the ground in Russia, near the border, and what we’ve been hearing from President Putin and other officials here in Moscow, that all tells us that the stakes here are really high.

michael barbaro

Well, Anton, thank you very much. We appreciate your time.

anton troianovski

Thanks for having me.

On Tuesday afternoon, both the White House and the Kremlin released details about the call between Putin and Biden. The White House said that Biden warned Putin of severe economic sanctions if Russia invaded Ukraine. The Kremlin said that Putin repeated his demands that Ukraine not be allowed to join NATO and that Western weapons systems not be placed inside Ukraine. But Putin made no promises to remove Russian forces from the border.

[music]",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/10/world/russia-us-ukraine-talks
1,e2b8642a-867f-4e08-bcbf-c8c8e969b506,"['Michael Levenson', 'Megan Specia', 'Edward Wong', 'Michael Schwirtz', 'Marc Santora', 'Ivan Nechepurenko', 'Victoria Kim', 'Mauricio Lima', 'Hikari Hida', 'The New York Times']",2022-03-18 00:00:00,"WASHINGTON — President Biden warned President Xi Jinping of China on Friday of “implications and consequences” if Beijing decides to give material aid to Russia to support its war in Ukraine, the White House said.

During a nearly two-hour video call, Mr. Biden laid out for Mr. Xi the punishments the United States and its allies had imposed on Russia after it invaded Ukraine last month, said a senior U.S. official, who spoke to reporters on the condition of anonymity to more freely discuss the diplomatic exchange. And he made the case, officials said, that China would pay a similarly heavy price if it backed President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in the fight, less than two months after Mr. Putin and Mr. Xi declared a partnership in facing off against the United States and the West.

“He made clear what the implications and consequences would be if China provides material support to Russia as it conducts brutal attacks against Ukrainian cities and civilians,” Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Friday afternoon. She declined to say how Mr. Xi responded or give details on the costs the United States has threatened to impose on Beijing.

The call was the culmination of an effort to cut off Russian appeals to China for help, as its invasion plan runs into trouble. Mr. Biden’s national security adviser issued a similar warning to his Chinese counterpart in Rome earlier in the week, setting up the video call on Friday between the two leaders.

In conversations this week, administration officials said they were concerned Beijing would try to appease both sides, publicly urging calm while quietly fueling the Russian effort and nurturing its relationship with Mr. Putin. Some of them pointed to how China had dealt with North Korea — calling for it to rein in its nuclear weapons program, but providing energy and other support to make up for United Nations sanctions.

The measures against Russia have also mainly taken the form of sanctions, but on a scale that appeared to surprise Mr. Putin, blocking him from even accessing much of the foreign reserves he had amassed in an effort to “sanctions-proof” the Russian economy. The effects have rippled outward, bringing the ruble to new lows and forcing credit agencies to warn that the Russian Federation was on the brink of default on its sovereign debt.

In its public messages, the White House is implying that the United States could impose what are called “secondary sanctions” on China, the world’s second-largest economy. Of course, unlike Russia, China’s size and economic reach mean penalties against it could reverberate in a much bigger way across the global economy, and various governments and companies could lobby heavily against such sanctions.

The conversation took place at a key moment in the war, just as Russia is seeking to take Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, and expand control of the southern coast. But the Russian military is reeling from high casualties — 7,000 or more Russian soldiers killed, according to a conservative American intelligence estimate — and the discovery of critical gaps in its prowess.

U.S. officials have warned that Mr. Putin is hoping to secure economic help, military hardware and rations for troops from China. American officials have leaked those findings, perhaps to both embarrass Mr. Putin and put China’s leadership on the spot.

U.S. and European officials see China’s role in the conflict as critical, and decisions by Mr. Xi could push the war in different directions — perhaps toward a cease-fire or more robust diplomatic talks, or toward renewed momentum by the Russian forces in their deadly offensive. Mr. Xi, who has built a bond with Mr. Putin over years, gave no indication he would help seek a diplomatic solution, according to an official Chinese readout of the call.

That summary emphasized the friction between China and the United States over Taiwan before addressing Ukraine. It said Mr. Xi pointed out that “the situation in Ukraine has developed to this point, which China does not want to see.” He reiterated standard talking points that China would provide humanitarian aid and that Russia and Ukraine should hold peace talks. Mr. Xi did not suggest any role China could play in ending the war, and instead said the United States and NATO should talk to Russia to resolve the crisis.

Mr. Xi also used a phrase he and other Chinese officials have previously employed when blaming troubles on the United States: “Let he who tied the bell on the tiger take it off.”

Tensions between the United States and China have grown since the invasion because of Beijing’s persistent alignment with Moscow, even as the Russian military kills thousands of Ukrainian civilians.

On Thursday, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken delivered his strongest public warning yet to China, saying the United States “will not hesitate to impose costs” if China gives military aid or other support to Russia. He and other officials say China’s strategy is to keep up a pretense of neutrality while siding with Russia.

Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden’s national security adviser, gave similar warnings to Yang Jiechi, a top Chinese foreign affairs official, when the two met in Rome on Monday. U.S. officials told reporters a day before those talks that Russia had asked China for military and economic aid after it began its war, and a Pentagon official said there were indications China was leaning toward obliging Russia on military support.

China could be held responsible for violating international law if it gives military aid to Russia, according to two prominent law professors, Oona A. Hathaway of Yale and Ryan Goodman of New York University.

Washington is also watching for any signs China might try to help Russia blunt the effect of the sanctions imposed by the United States and its European and Asian allies. Large Chinese companies will likely avoid overtly violating those sanctions for fear of jeopardizing their global commerce.

“China does not want its struggling economy to be hit by sanctions, and the Biden administration is mindful of the economic fallout of imposing them,” said Daniel R. Russel, a former assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs.

China analysts doubt Mr. Xi will distance himself from Mr. Putin. The two have met 38 times as national leaders and developed a bond that is highly personal. They share a major strategic interest in trying to weaken American power. At their last meeting, just two weeks before Mr. Putin’s invasion, they issued a 5,000-word statement that said their partnership had “no limits” and that they intended to stand together against U.S.-led democratic nations.

For weeks, Chinese officials have blamed the United States for the war and echoed Mr. Putin in criticizing NATO, while expressing concern for the humanitarian crisis. Chinese diplomats and state media organizations have amplified Kremlin propaganda and a conspiracy theory about Pentagon-funded bioweapons labs in Ukraine.

On Wednesday, Xue Hanqin, the Chinese judge at the International Court of Justice, sided with the Russian judge in dissenting from a ruling that Russia must immediately end its war in Ukraine. The vote was 13 to 2.

Hours before the call on Friday, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, kept up a combative tone. Asked by a reporter about China’s views on civilian casualties in Ukraine, he said, “As the culprit of the Ukraine crisis, why does the U.S. keep smearing China instead of reflecting on the security predicament in Europe caused by the eastward expansion of U.S.-led NATO?”

China’s refusal to condemn Russia’s atrocities and its endorsement of Russia’s views on NATO have made European nations more suspicious of Beijing. Leaders of nations in the European Union, one of China’s largest trading partners, talk about China in increasingly hostile tones, a situation that could worsen if Mr. Xi continues his support of Mr. Putin.

“China has a strategic opportunity to tie itself to the global order, which has fueled its economic growth,” said Alina Polyakova, the president of the Center for European Policy Analysis in Washington. “Or it could make an ideological decision to align itself with Russia.

“In the end the Russian economy is not the golden goose for China’s growth,” she said. “It is Western countries.”

But Kevin Rudd, the former Australian prime minister and the current president of the Asia Society in New York, said that “China saw today’s call as an opportunity to not only wash Beijing’s hands of responsibility for ending Putin’s blitzkrieg in Ukraine, but to also continue to paint the United States as responsible for Russia’s actions in the first place.”

He noted that when Mr. Xi told Mr. Biden to “Let he who tied the bell on the tiger take it off,” he was referring to the United States.

“But the fact is that China is the only power capable of getting Putin to withdraw,” Mr. Rudd said, “and it is unwilling to do so.”

Starting in November, American officials began sharing intelligence about Russia’s troop buildup around Ukraine with Chinese officials and urged them to ask Mr. Putin not to invade, but were repeatedly rebuffed, U.S. officials have said. A Western intelligence report said senior Chinese officials asked senior Russian officials in early February to delay an invasion of Ukraine until after the Winter Olympics in Beijing, U.S. and European officials have said.

On Friday, Taiwan’s defense ministry confirmed reports that a Chinese aircraft carrier, the Shandong, sailed through the Taiwan Strait just hours before Mr. Biden and Mr. Xi spoke. Taiwan remains the most sensitive and intractable issue between China and the United States. Mr. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has underscored questions over whether China would try to invade the democratic island, which is claimed by Beijing but has never been under Communist Party rule.

The Taiwanese defense ministry declined to comment on reports that a U.S.-guided missile destroyer shadowed the carrier for part of its route.

The United States provides defensive equipment to Taiwan and maintains “strategic ambiguity,” meaning it leaves open whether it would send its military to defend Taiwan if China tries to invade.

A U.S. official said Mr. Biden reiterated to Mr. Xi on the call that the United States abided by the “One China” policy, which acknowledges but does not endorse Beijing’s insistence that Taiwan and China are part of the same country.

U.S. and Western defense officials believe Russian President Vladimir Putin had planned on a lightning campaign to seize Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, and topple Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a matter of days. Now, as his forces struggle to encircle the capital and are beset by a lack of basic supplies, the war’s outcome is becoming increasingly unclear.

“I’m fucking tired from bandaging everybody and loading their fucking limbs,” one Russian soldier fighting close to Mariupol, Ukraine, said in a message intercepted by Ukraine’s Security Service. “Never in my life have I seen so many limbs. No hand, no leg, no fucking head.”

Three weeks after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, social media around the world is replete with images of upturned Russian tanks, convoys stuck in the mud, and conscripted troops calling home to their families—who had no idea they were heading to war. Morgues in neighboring Belarus are reportedly overflowing with the dead. And on the front lines, inexperienced units, facing a stiffer-than-expected Ukrainian resistance that has blown up bridges to halt invaders and attacked their supplies, are worried about how long they can hold out.

Now, as his forces struggle to encircle the capital and are beset by a lack of basic supplies, the war’s outcome is becoming increasingly unclear.

“None of this has gone to plan for Russia,” said Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military with CNA, a think tank. “The plan was bewildering and based on assumptions that had no clear relationship to reality. The outcome now is indeterminate.”

Although Putin’s war has been an operational debacle, it has also proved to be a strategic catastrophe that has already seen many of the Russian president’s greatest fears become a reality. It has spurred NATO to bolster its presence in Eastern Europe and sparked the interest of previously neutral countries like Finland to join the alliance. Germany overcame its allergy to defense spending and is starting to rethink reliance on Russian energy. Western countries have poured vital military aid into Ukraine, which is closer to European Union membership than it’s been in years. Meanwhile, the Russian economy reels from unprecedented sanctions, with Western corporations, like Russia’s best and brightest, fleeing the country in a massive exodus.

The decision to invade and the kind of war meant to be fought appears to have been based on a series of bad assumptions fed by poor information. Russia made the wrong assumptions about its own military and about Ukraine’s. It also mistakenly thought that much of Ukraine would welcome Russian forces as liberators, as some parts did after the 2014 lightning annexation of the Crimean Peninsula. Putin has been highly isolated during the COVID-19 pandemic, and his rule has become increasingly authoritarian, leading many longtime observers to question the quality and accuracy of information being passed up to the Russian leader by senior Russian officials.

“If in the annals of history there is going to be a name for this war, it’s going to be called the war of underestimates,” said Lithuanian Deputy Foreign Minister Mantas Adomenas.

Military blunders have been the most evident. Moscow’s strategy has followed three distinct phases in the opening weeks of the war, said Jack Watling, a research fellow on land warfare with the Royal United Services Institute, a British think tank.

The opening attack in the early hours of Feb. 24 bore all the hallmarks of an attempted “coup de main,” a surprise attack, he said, with “the aim being to rapidly capture political centers and then control the country.” The initial attack was derailed by stiff Ukrainian resistance as well as confusion among the Russian soldiers surging across the border. Reports from captured Russian soldiers reveal they were given little advance notice that they were going to war, leaving them psychologically unprepared and short on basic supplies like food and fuel.

The invading Russian forces then switched to a period of more conventional warfare, battering major Ukrainian cities, such as Mariupol and Kharkiv, with artillery shelling. Again, Russian forces were plagued by poorly combined arms proficiency—the use of air, land, and artillery power in coordination—leaving many Russian troops exposed to Ukrainian counterattacks. Western officials estimate that around 7,000 Russian soldiers have been killed so far; Ukraine’s estimates of Russian losses are even higher, though calculating troop losses is difficult.

In recent weeks, Russian forces appear to have shifted to an attempt to encircle key cities in a bid to starve them out while limiting Russian casualties. In Mariupol on Ukraine’s southeastern coast, which has borne the brunt of this approach, hundreds of thousands of people have been taken captive in their own city. Russian troops have choked off access to the outside world while food, water, and medical aid become scarce and the victims of Russian shelling pile up in mass graves—or lay prostrate in the streets.

Three weeks into Putin’s war, Russia’s nearly 200,000-strong force—many of them conscripts—have failed to seize any major Ukrainian cities, leaving the war-torn country a mess of red splotches indicating land seized, if not yet controlled, in the eastern and southern parts of the country. A stiffer-than-expected Ukrainian resistance has “largely stalled” Putin’s offensive, the British defense intelligence agency assessed on Thursday. “Russian forces have made minimal progress on land, sea, or air in recent days, and they continue to suffer heavy losses,” the agency said in a statement.

Russian troops have also been much less mobile than Western observers expected at the outset of the war, largely sticking to roads while Ukrainian forces lie in wait. The British Ministry of Defence’s internal intelligence agency said on Wednesday that Ukrainian troops “have adeptly exploited Russia’s lack of [maneuver], frustrating the Russian advance and inflicting heavy losses on the invading forces.” A British intelligence assessment released Wednesday also indicated that Russia has been forced to divert troops to defend supply lines against Ukrainian attacks.

Instead of taking the invading Russian forces on in large, open battles, the Ukrainian military has largely stuck to urban areas, where they know the terrain. “All of the battles are small, but they’re steadily attritioning the Russian military,” Kofman said.

Although the initial surge included the greater part of Russia’s allegedly combat-ready formations, Moscow is already mustering reinforcements, including from the far east of the country (as well as mulling the use of Syrian mercenaries). On Thursday, a senior U.S. defense official said Russia’s consideration of bringing in new troops and supplies to reinforce more than 100 battalion tactical groups already in the country indicated that the Kremlin “was beginning to get concerned about the longevity” of its forces in Ukraine. One European diplomat, who spoke to Foreign Policy on condition of anonymity to give a candid military assessment, said Russia has begun to lose enough troops in combat to have a real impact on its ability to carry out offensive operations, and Russian troops on the front lines are beginning to worry about how long they can hold out.

“The Russian troops on the ground definitely think like that. The Russian generals probably think like that,” the European diplomat said. “But whether or not this is getting to Putin or whether he’s listening to this is another matter.”

Russia hasn’t fared a lot better in the skies. Originally expected to win air dominance over Ukraine’s tiny air force in a matter of days, the domain remains contested after three weeks. Although the Russian Air Force played a significant role in Syria, it largely flew unopposed in simple formations during daylight hours. “I think this highlights significant training and command and control deficiencies in the air force,” Watling said.

Ukraine could soon be getting more reinforcements too, in spite of the U.S. Defense Department’s decision to nix a Polish plan to transfer dozens of Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets to a U.S. air base in Germany for Ukrainian pilots to pick up. At a press conference on Thursday alongside U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Slovakian Defense Minister Jaroslav Naj said his country was in talks with U.S. and Ukrainian officials to provide Russian-made S-300 air defense batteries to Ukraine, provided that NATO members could replace their own air defenses.

The Kremlin is also getting a different kind of combat from Ukraine than they anticipated. A senior Israeli official, speaking to reporters earlier this week, said Putin believed that Russian forces would be fighting a 20th-century-style force-on-force conflict against Ukrainian formations but have been hit instead with small-unit ambushes that have halted their advance using anti-tank weapons from the West, like the U.S. Javelin and British next-generation light anti-tank weapon rocket systems.

“Logistically, something doesn’t work,” the Israeli official said, citing Russia’s 40-mile convoy of military vehicles and supplies that stalled north of Kyiv before U.S. defense officials and satellite imagery detected groupings of vehicles seeking cover from Ukrainian hit-and-run attacks in tree lines and industrial zones.

Even though military officials anticipated that Ukraine’s relatively flat terrain might be a boon to Russian invaders, intelligence analysts believe Ukraine’s much smaller military has found ways to use it to their advantage. Defenders destroyed a bridge in Irpin, outside of Kyiv, to halt the 40-mile-long convoy, for example; reservoirs were also opened, turning tank country into swampland.

Still significant danger remains in the east, with U.S. defense officials insistent that Russia is trying to encircle Ukrainian troops on the front lines in the Donbass from the north and the south and cut them off before they can defend Kyiv. Russia took the town of Izyum, southeast of Kharkiv, an indication that the military could seek to push farther south. Russian forces have pounded the southeast as well.

As the Ukrainian military plays for time and holds off the Russian advance, Zelensky is skillfully lobbying Western countries for more military aid. In addresses to U.S. Congress as well as British and German parliaments, Zelensky has invoked memories of all three countries’ experiences with World War II in a bid to spur them to further action. “I address all of you who heard politicians say every year ‘never again,’ but I can see these words are worth nothing. Now, our whole nation is being exterminated in Europe. Why?” Zelensky asked the German Bundestag on Thursday.

Having bungled its initial attack, the next phase of the war rests on whether Moscow can solve its logistics challenges and stabilize its troop losses while Ukraine is supplied with more and better arms from the West.

“You can see them being bled out over a long period of time,” Watling said. “The second way that this could go is that the Russians unscramble their logistics over the next couple of weeks, start to prioritize their axis of advance, close off key cities, and suck up the punishment until they starve them out. In which case, you can see a scenario in which, in six months, they have functionally taken over eastern Ukraine.”",https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/03/18/russia-putin-ukraine-war-three-weeks/

The Australian government has imposed sanctions on two Russian oligarchs who have assets in the country, after facing questions about why they were omitted from an earlier round of economic measures triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Oleg Deripaska, who has a stake in an alumina refinery in Gladstone, Queensland, run by Rio Tinto, and Viktor Vekselberg, who has an interest in a gas project in the Beetaloo basin in the Northern Territory, were not among 41 oligarchs and family members hit with sanctions by Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on Monday.

The head of Ukraine’s embassy in Canberra, Volodymyr Shalkivskiy, said on Wednesday: “We hope that those Russian oligarchs will be included in the next round of sanctions.”

Australia also placed sanctions on Russia’s finance ministry and 11 additional banks and government organisations, covering the majority of the country’s banking assets along with all entities that handle Russia’s sovereign debt.

“With our recent inclusion of the Central Bank of Russia, Australia has now targeted all Russian government entities responsible for issuing and managing Russia’s sovereign debt,” minister for foreign affairs Marise Payne said in a statement.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/mar/17/russia-ukraine-war-latest-kremlin-anger-after-biden-calls-putin-a-war-criminal-us-to-send-more-military-aid-live

Influx of Ukrainians will become big challenge for Germany, Scholz says

The growing number of Ukrainians seeking refuge in Germany will become a “big, big challenge”, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said.

Speaking after talks with the leaders of Germany’s 16 states to discuss the coronavirus pandemic, Scholz said that despite the challenge it should be relatively easy to help Ukrainians settle in given that they don’t need visas to enter Germany and they have automatic access to healthcare and education as well as language and integration courses.

German police have so far registered just under 190,000 Ukrainians who have fled Russia’s invasion of their country.

The ICRC had to leave the city on Wednesday, Maurer told a news conference, because its staff had “no operational capacity any more”, but the organisation would be making arrangements to bring aid “as soon as we have a safe way”.

The ICRC was also still seeking access to prisoners of war from both sides in the conflict, adding captured troops should be treated with dignity and not exposed to “public curiosity”.

France says Russia ‘pretending to negotiate’ in Ukraine talks

Russia is pretending to negotiate with Ukraine, while pursuing the invasion of its neighbour in line with a brutal strategy it has used elsewhere, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has said.

“Unfortunately we’re still facing the same Russian logic – making maximalist demands, wanting Ukraine to surrender and intensifying siege warfare,” Le Drian told newspaper Le Parisien.

“Just as in and Aleppo (in Syria), there are three typical elements – indiscriminate bombardment, so-called humanitarian “corridors” designed to allow them to accuse the other side of failing to respect them, and talks with no objective other than pretending that they are negotiating.”

Russia is rethinking its approach: Analyst

Speaking to Al Jazeera, Frank Ledwidge, senior lecturer in military capabilities and strategy at the University of Portsmouth, said Russia’s attack “has, in military terms, culminated”.

“Essentially, that they’ve gone as far as they can with the logistics and weaponry they brought into the country – that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s stalled,” he added.

“What we’re seeing now is what’s called an operational pause as they start to get, in colloquial terms, their act together, which they have not had largely due to very poor planning assumptions in the early part of the campaign.

“So they’d be working frantically to try to get weapons and get their planning sorted out and to understand where does it go next. And of course, Ukrainians have a say in that, which is why we are starting to see counterattacks by Ukrainian armed forces that seem to be having some effect.”

It also said that Ukrainian forces destroyed 444 Russian tanks, 1435 armoured vehicles, 86 planes, 108 helicopters, 11 drones and three ships.

It said the figures were approximate and their verification was “complicated” by the high intensity of the fighting.

China rejects US accusation it is not acting in line with UN charter

The Chinese foreign ministry says it firmly rejects US Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s comment that China’s unwillingness to condemn Russia is inconsistent with China’s position on the United Nations charter.

China always believes the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states should be upheld, said Zhao Lijian, spokesperson at the Chinese foreign ministry, at a regular press conference.

In an interview with NPR news on Wednesday, Blinken said the fact that China “has not stood strongly against” Russia’s aggression in Ukraine flies in the face of China’s commitments as a permanent member of the UN Security Council responsible for maintaining peace and security.

“It’s totally inconsistent with what China says and repeats over and over again about the sanctity of the United Nations charter and the basic principles, including the sovereignty of nations,” Blinken said.

Bombed Mariupol theatre sheltering at least 500 civilians: HRW

Human Rights Watch says the Mariupol theatre hit during an alleged Russian attack was sheltering at least 500 civilians.

“Until we know more, we cannot rule out the possibility of a Ukrainian military target in the area of the theatre, but we do know that the theatre had been housing at least 500 civilians,” said Belkis Wille, senior crisis and conflict researcher at Human Rights Watch.

“This raises serious concerns about what the intended target was in a city where civilians have already been under siege for days and telecommunications, power, water and heating have been almost completely cut off.”

Russian forces attacking Ukraine are likely turning to less precise heavy weapons that are less effective from a military standpoint and more likely to kill civilians, a European government said.

The U.K. Defence Ministry said late Wednesday local time that Russia has expended more of its ""stand-off air launched weapons"" than it had expected, because it has failed to achieve its objectives or to gain control of Ukrainian airspace.

""Stand-off"" weaponry refers to missiles that Russian aircraft can fire from a long distance without exposing themselves to Ukrainian anti-aircraft weapons. Ukraine's anti-aircraft capabilities are still active and taking down Russian helicopters and jets.

""As a result, it is likely Russia is resorting to the use of older, less precise weapons, which are less militarily effective and more likely to result in civilian casualties,"" the ministry said in an intelligence update.

In response to a request for comment, the Russian Ministry of Defense directed CNBC to a statement from more than two weeks ago which said in part that Russian forces carry out strikes only on military targets ""using high-precision weapons.""

However, overwhelming photographic and video evidence, as well as official assessments from the United States, United Kingdom and others, show that Russia is in fact striking civilian targets with unguided weapons.

Weapons like rockets, ""dumb"" unguided bombs, and long-range artillery are less accurate and therefore more likely to hit unintended targets.

According to the most recent confirmed UN figures, more than 700 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the invasion began, but the actual number is likely to be much higher.

Death tolls from cities under artillery bombardment, such as Kharkiv and Mariupol, are unknown.

7,e2b8642a-867f-4e08-bcbf-c8c8e969b506,"['Jen Kirby', 'Jonathan Guyer', 'Mar']",2022-03-12 07:30:00-05:00,"Russia’s war in Ukraine has stretched on for more than three weeks, a relentless bombardment of the country’s cities and towns that has led to more than 800 civilian deaths, destroyed civilian infrastructure, and forced more than 3.3 million people to flee Ukraine, creating a new humanitarian crisis in Europe.

The devastation is far from over.

The scale of the Russian invasion — the shelling of major cities like Kyiv, the capital, and Kharkiv, in the east — hinted at Russian President Vladimir Putin’s larger aims: Seizing control of Ukraine, with the goal of regime change. Though its military is far bigger than Ukraine’s, Russia’s apparently confounding strategic decisions and logistical setbacks, combined with the ferocity of Ukraine’s resistance, have stymied its advance.

That has not stopped a catastrophe from unfolding within Ukraine, even as it has prompted Western allies to effectively wage economic warfare against Moscow with unprecedented sanctions.

It will only get worse as this war grinds on, experts said. “Despite the surprisingly poor military performance of the Russian military to date, we’re still in the early opening phase of this conflict,” said Sara Bjerg Moller, an assistant professor of international security at Seton Hall University.

This toll is expected to climb, especially as the Russian offensive intensifies around Ukrainian cities, where shelling and strikes have hit civilian targets, and as efforts at high-level Ukraine-Russia negotiations have so far failed. All of this is happening as Russian forces appear to be preparing to lay siege to Kyiv.

“This war is about the battle of Kyiv,” said John Spencer, a retired Army officer and chair of urban warfare studies at the Madison Policy Forum.

Taking Kyiv would mean taking control of Ukraine — or at least deposing the government of Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president whose defiance has galvanized the Ukrainian resistance. Most experts believe Russia will prevail, especially if it can cut off Kyiv, and the Ukrainian resistance, from supplies.

Just because Russia may ultimately succeed militarily does not mean it will win this war. A Ukrainian insurgency could take root. The political, domestic, and international costs to Russia could challenge Putin’s regime. The West’s sanctions are throttling Russia’s economy, and they could do lasting damage. Russia’s war has strengthened the Western alliance in the immediate term, but that political will could be tested as energy prices spike and as the war and refugee crisis wear on.

“War is never isolated,” Zelenskyy said in a video address Thursday. “It always beats both the victim and the aggressor. The aggressor just realizes it later. But it always realizes and always suffers.”

The war in Ukraine is likely going to become more violent

Russia’s strategic setbacks have undermined its mission to take Ukraine, but it has only exacerbated the brutal and indiscriminate war, not even a month old.

The longer and harder the Ukrainian resistance fights, the more likely Russia may deploy more aggressive tactics to try to achieve their aims. “This is what we would call a war of attrition. They are trying to grind down the Ukrainian people’s morale, and unfortunately, that includes the bodies of Ukrainians,” Moller said.

Urban warfare is particularly calamitous, as civilians who have not evacuated are often caught in the middle of battles that happen block-by-block. Russia’s military tactics in cities — witnessed in places like Syria and Grozny in Chechnya in 1999 — have shown little regard for civilian protection. Spencer, the urban warfare specialist, said even Putin is limited, to a degree, by the rules of war, and so he is likely to claim that civilian infrastructure — like hospitals — are also military targets.

NEW campaign update from @TheStudyofWar and @criticalthreats: #Russian operations to continue the encirclement of and assault on #Kyiv have likely begun, although on a smaller scale and in a more ad hoc manner than we expected. https://t.co/tt5uYJacyg pic.twitter.com/ZoQRaOwNHF — ISW (@TheStudyofWar) March 9, 2022

But urban warfare is, by nature, murky and complex and often far more deadly. Even if Russia attempts precision attacks, it can have a cascading effect — Russia bombs alleged military targets, those operations move, Russia bombs again. “You’re going to use so many of them, the end result is the same as if you just used indiscriminate, mass artillery barrage,” said Lance Davies, a senior lecturer in defense and international affairs at the UK’s Royal Military Academy.

Even in the early days of this war, Russia’s efforts are already having this effect. “They’re causing tremendous damage to civilian infrastructure,” said Rachel Denber, the deputy director of the Europe and Central Asia division at Human Rights Watch. “They’re taking many, many civilian lives.” Denber pointed to the use of weapons in heavily populated areas, including those that are explicitly banned, like cluster munitions. Human Rights Watch documented their use in three residential areas in Kharkiv on February 28. “You put that in a city like Kharkiv, and if it’s a populated area, no matter what you were aiming at, no matter what the target, it’s going to hurt civilians,” she said.

The United Nations has confirmed at least 2,149 civilian casualties, including 816 killed as of March 17, though these numbers are likely undercounts, as intense fighting in some areas has made it difficult to verify statistics.

All of this is exacerbating the humanitarian catastrophe on the ground in Ukraine, as shelling cuts off power stations and other supply lines, effectively trapping people within war zones in subzero temperatures without electricity or water, and with dwindling food, fuel, and medical supplies. In Mariupol, a city of 400,000 that has been under Russian siege for days, people were reportedly melting snow for drinking water. Humanitarian groups say the fighting is making it difficult to deliver aid or to reach those civilians left behind — often elderly or disabled people, or other vulnerable populations that didn’t have the ability to flee.

Ukrainian and Russian officials agreed to a temporary ceasefire to establish humanitarian corridors out of six cities on March 9, but the enforcement of those safe passages has been spotty, at best. According to the United Nations, on March 9, evacuations did happen in some places, but there was “limited movement” in the vulnerable areas, like Mariupol and the outskirts of Kyiv. Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of shelling some of those routes, and have rejected Russia’s calls for refugees to be evacuated to Russia or Belarus. Russian officials have blamed disruption on Ukrainian forces.

The fighting across Ukraine has forced about 9.8 million people to flee so far, according to the United Nations. Nearly 6.5 million people are internally displaced within Ukraine, although tens of thousands of Ukrainians were already forcibly displaced before Russia’s invasion because of the eight-year war in the Donbas region. Many have taken refugee in oblasts (basically, administrative regions) in western and northwestern Ukraine.

Another 3.3 million Ukrainians have escaped, mostly to neighboring countries like Poland, Romania, and Moldova. It is Europe’s largest refugee crisis since World War II, and host countries and aid agencies are trying to meet the astounding needs of these refugees, most of whom are women and children.

“They need warmth, they need shelter, they need transportation to accommodations,” said Becky Bakr Abdulla, an adviser to the Norwegian Refugee Council who is currently based in Poland. “They need food, they need water. Many need legal aid — their passports have been stolen, they’ve forgotten their birth certificates.”

How the war in Ukraine began, and what’s happened so far

For months, Russia built up troops along the Ukrainian border, reaching around 190,000 on the eve of the invasion. At the same time, Russia issued a series of maximalist demands to the United States and NATO allies, including an end to NATO’s eastward expansion and a ban on Ukraine entering NATO, among other “security guarantees.” All were nonstarters for the West.

But the short answer to why Russia decided to follow through with an invasion: Vladimir Putin.

From Putin’s perspective, many historians of Europe have said, the enlargement of NATO, which has moved steadily closer to Russia’s borders, was certainly a factor. But Putin’s speech on the eve of his invasion offers another clue: the Russian president basically denied Ukrainian statehood, and said the country rightfully belongs to Russia.

But Russia’s history of incursions, invasions, and occupations under Putin — including Chechnya, Georgia, and Crimea — have foreshadowed a new, even more brutal war. Seen through this lens, he is not a madman, but a leader who came to power with the lethal siege of Grozny in Chechnya in 1999, who has pursued increasingly violent policy, and who has been willing to inflict civilian casualties to achieve his foreign policy goals.

In 2014, Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine that culminated in the occupation of the Crimea peninsula in the south. Later that year, Russia deployed hybrid tactics, such as proxy militias and soldiers without insignia, to attack the Donbas region, where 14,000 people have died since 2014. On February 22, in the days before Putin launched a full-fledged war on Ukraine, he sent Russian troops into Donbas and declared two provinces there independent.

This time, according to former State Department Russia specialist Michael Kimmage, Putin miscalculated the difficulty of taking over Ukraine. Still, as the days go on, this war could escalate to unimaginable levels of violence. “If Putin really is feeling very threatened, it’s possible that he will dig in his heels, double down and take a lot of risks in order to prevent any potential loss of power,” said Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a former intelligence officer who’s now a senior fellow and director of the Transatlantic Security Program at the Center for a New American Security.

Russia is committing possible war crimes in Ukraine, and Ukrainians are responding with their full military force. They have also developed a strong civil resistance enabled by volunteers of all stripes. “All the nation is involved, not only the army,” said a Ukrainian person who has been supplying medicines.

According to a conservative estimate by US intelligence, around 7,000 Russian personnel have died so far — more troops than the US lost over two decades of fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq.

But Russia’s initial setback could lead to increasingly brutal tactics. “We’re looking at World War II kinds of atrocities. Bombing of civilians, rocket fire and artillery, smashing cities, a million refugees; that what looked impossible before now looks within the realm,” said Daniel Fried, a former ambassador to Poland and current fellow at the Atlantic Council.

How the West has responded so far

In the aftermath of Russia’s Ukrainian invasion, the United States and its allies imposed unprecedented sanctions and other penalties on Russia, acting with a swiftness and cohesion that surprised some observers, including, most likely, Putin himself.

“The US and the Western reaction to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is essentially blowing the lid off of sanctions,” said Julia Friedlander, director of the Economic Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council. “Never in the past have we accelerated to such strong sanctions and economic restrictions in such a quick period of time — and also considered doing it on one of the largest economies in the world.”

There’s a lot of sanctions, and the US and its partners have only increased the pressure since. President Joe Biden announced on March 8 that the US would place extreme limits on energy imports from Russia — the kind of last-resort option that few experts thought might happen because of the shock to energy prices and the global economy. (Europe, far more dependent on Russian energy imports, has not joined these sanctions.) On March 11, Biden pushed Congress to strip Russia of its “most favored nation” status, which would put tariffs on Russian goods, though it’s likely to have limited impact compared to the slew of sanctions that already exist.

Ukraine’s resistance in the face of Russian aggression helped push Western leaders to take more robust action, as this fight became framed in Washington and in European capitals as a fight between autocracy and democracy. A lot of credit goes to Zelenskyy himself, whose impassioned pleas to Western leaders motivated them to deliver more lethal aid to Ukraine and implement tougher sanctions.

Among the toughest sanctions are those against Russia’s central bank. The US and European Union did this in an effort to block Russia from using its considerable foreign reserves to prop up its currency, the ruble, and to undermine its ability to pay for its Ukraine war. Russia had tried to sanction-proof its economy after 2014, shifting away from US dollars, but the EU’s decision to join in undermined Russia’s so-called “fortress economy.”

The US and the EU also cut several Russian banks off from SWIFT, the global messaging system that facilitates foreign transactions. As Ben Walsh wrote for Vox, more than 11,000 different banks use SWIFT for cross-border transactions, and it was used in about 70 percent of transfers in Russia. Even here, though, certain banks were excluded from these measures to allow energy transactions, and EU countries, like Germany, are so far blocking efforts to expand these penalties.

The US has targeted numerous Russian banks, including two of Russia’s biggest, Sberbank and VTB. The US, along with other partners, have put bans on technology and other exports to Russia, and they’ve placed financial sanctions on oligarchs and other Russian officials, including Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Putin himself. Russian oligarchs have had their yachts seized in European vacation towns because of these sanctions, and the US has launched — and, yes, this is real — Task Force Kleptocapture to help enforce sanctions, although oligarchs’ actual influence on Putin’s war is limited.

These penalties are widespread — besides Europe, partners like South Korea and Japan have joined in. Even neutral countries like Switzerland have imposed sanctions (though there are loopholes.) Big Tech companies, cultural institutions, and international corporations, from Mastercard to McDonald’s, are pulling out of the country.

Experts said there are still some economic penalties left in the toolbox, but what’s already in place is massively damaging to the Russian economy. Russia’s economy is expected to dramatically shrink; its stock market remains closed. And even if these sanctions are targeted toward Russia’s ability to make war, the damage done to the Russian economic system will inevitably trickle down to ordinary Russians.

The fallout will not be limited to Russia. Biden’s announcement of an oil embargo against Russia has increased energy prices; what Biden, at least, is calling “Putin’s price hike.” And Russia may still engage in some sort of countermeasures, including cyberattacks or other meddling activity in the West.

How we get out of this

The US is doing almost everything it can without officially being a party to the conflict. The US has funneled 17,000 anti-tank missiles so far, including Javelins missiles, to Ukraine. On March 16, the US announced $800 million in additional military aid, including thousands of anti-armor weapons and small arms, 800 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, and millions of rounds of ammunition.

Biden rejected the US enforcement of a no-fly zone in Ukraine, a military policy that polls surprisingly well among Americans but essentially means attacking any Russian aircraft that enters Ukrainian airspace. Seventy-eight national security scholars came out against a no-fly zone, saying that scenario would edge the US too close to a direct conflict with Russia.

So far, negotiations between Russia and Ukraine have faltered. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, has said that the fighting could stop if Ukrainians agreed to neutrality (and no NATO membership), and agreed to recognize Crimea as Russian and the Donbas region as independent. “Is this a serious offer?” said Fried, the former ambassador who had experience working with Peskov. “It could be posturing. The Russians are liars.”

Zelenskyy has signaled some openness to neutrality, but Ukraine is going to want some serious security guarantees that it’s not clear Russia is willing to give.

The US’s absolutist rhetoric has complicated those efforts. Biden, in his State of the Union address, framed this conflict as a battle between democracy and tyranny. Even if a strong argument can be made in favor of that, given Putin’s actions, such language poses challenges for Western diplomats who must forge an off-ramp for Putin to end this war.

“If it’s good against evil, how do you compromise with evil?” said Thomas Graham, a Russia expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. “Putin does need a face-saving way to back down from some of his demands. But if we have a compromise solution to this conflict, we’re going to need off-ramps as well, to explain why we accept that less than a total defeat for Putin.”

In a Politico essay, Graham and scholar Rajan Menon proposed a framework for a negotiated outcome that begins with confidence-building measures between the US and Russia, rebuilding arms control treaties. The US and NATO would pledge that neither Ukraine nor Georgia will join NATO in the next several years or decades, though the possibility may be open someday. This would culminate in a “new security order for Russia,” they write. Russian academic Alexander Dynkin circulated a similar idea in the lead-up to the war.

Gavin Wilde, a former director for the National Security Council who focused on Russia during the Trump administration, says the opportunities for a diplomatic resolution have not yet been exhausted. “The conundrum we found ourselves in quite a lot with Russia is, you have to talk to them. Because lives are at stake. These are two nuclear powers, and you have to keep talking,” he said.

What a Russian victory would mean for the world

The world has been galvanized by Ukraine’s small victories in this conflict.

Still, Ukraine faces long odds. By the numbers, the Russian military budget is about ten times that of Ukraine. The Russian military has 900,000 active troops, and the Ukrainian military has 196,000. Ukrainians may have the tactical advantage and the spirit to persevere, but structural factors weigh in Russia’s favor.

This all presages what could be a long, drawn-out war, all documented on iPhones. “It’s not going to be pretty,” says Samuel Charap, who studies the Russian military at RAND. A siege of major Ukrainian cities means “cutting off supply lines to a city and making it intolerable for people to resist — to engender surrender by inflicting pain.”

Still, Russia’s performance so far has been so poor that the scales may ultimately tip toward Ukraine. Mark Hertling, who was the top commander of the US Army’s European forces before retiring in 2013, says that the corruption within the Russian military has slowed down the advance.

“Unless it’s just a continuous shelling — but I don’t think Russia can even sustain that with their logistics support. They have already blown their wad quite a bit in terms of missiles and rockets,” Hertling said. “They’re having trouble moving, they’re having trouble resupplying. And when you have those two things combined, you’re going to have some big problems.”

However this plays out, the cruel effects of this war won’t just be felt in Ukraine. It’s truly a global crisis. The comprehensive sanctions on Russia will have massive implications for the Russian economy, hurting citizens and residents who have nothing to do with their autocratic leader. There will also be vast knock-on effects on the world economy, with particularly frightening implications for food security in the poorest countries. Those effects may be most visceral for stomachs in the Middle East; Egypt and Yemen depend on Russian and Ukrainian wheat.

The unprecedented sanctions may have unprecedented impact. “We don’t know what the full consequences of this will be, because we’ve never raised this type of economic warfare,” Graham said. “It’s hard to overestimate the shock that the Russian military operation has caused around the world and the fears that it has stoked about wider warfare in Europe.”",https://www.vox.com/22970918/russia-war-in-ukraine-explained

Russia's U.N. ambassador won't ask for vote on heavily criticized Ukraine resolution Russia’s U.N. ambassador says he is not asking for a vote Friday on its resolution on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, which has been sharply criticized by Western countries for making no mention of Russia’s responsibility for the war against its smaller neighbor. Vassily Nebenzia told the U.N. Security Council Thursday that Russia decided at this stage not to seek a vote because of pressure from the United States and Albania on U.N. members to oppose it, but he stressed that Moscow is not withdrawing the resolution. Nebenzia said Russia plans to go ahead with a council meeting Friday to discuss again its allegations of U.S. “biological laboratories” in Ukraine with claiming new documents. His initial charge was made without any evidence and repeatedly denied by U.S. and Ukrainian officials. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield responded to Nebenzia’s announcement by saying “their farcical humanitarian resolution ... was doomed to fail.” “We know if Russia really cared about humanitarian crises, the one that it created, it could simply stop its attacks on the people of Ukraine,” she said. “But instead, they want to call for another Security Council meeting to use this council as a venue for its disinformation and for promoting its propaganda.” At last Friday’s council meeting on Russia’s initial allegations of U.S. “biological activities,” Thomas-Greenfield accused Russia of using the Security Council for “lying and spreading disinformation” as part of a potential false-flag operation by Moscow for the use of chemical or biological agents in Ukraine.

House passes bill to suspend normal trade relations with Russia and Belarus The House passed legislation Thursday that would suspend normal trade relations with Russia, a move designed to further isolate Moscow’s economy in response to President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. The measure passed 424-8, with all opposition coming from Republicans. The bill would revoke Russia’s “most favored nation” status in the World Trade Organization and pave the way for President Joe Biden to introduce higher tariffs on Russian goods such as steel, aluminum and plywood. It’s the latest in a series of punitive actions in coordination with the European Union and the Group of Seven industrial nations after Russia invaded Ukraine last month. Read the full story.

WHO: At least 43 attacks on health care facilities; 12 killed and 34 injured The World Health Organization has verified 43 attacks on health care facilities in Ukraine, with 12 people having been killed and 34 others injured, including health care workers, the WHO's director-general said Thursday. ""In any conflict, attacks on health care are a violation of international humanitarian law,"" Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the U.N. Security Council. A maternity hospital in the besieged city of Mariupol was attacked last week, drawing new condemnation of Russia, which attacked and invaded Ukraine three weeks ago. Ukraine's president said three people died in the attack. A pregnant woman who was seen carried from the hospital died along with her unborn baby, Ukraine's Foreign Affairs Ministry said Monday. It was unclear whether the unnamed woman was included in that number. U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday called Russian President Vladimir Putin a ""war criminal."" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday that Russia has been attacking civilian sites, including, in this week alone, a hospital, three schools and a boarding school for visually impaired children in the Luhansk region. Russia has denied targeting civilians. The U.N. human rights office said Thursday it has recorded 2,032 civilian casualties in Ukraine. Of those, 780 people were killed, including 58 children, and 1,252 others were injured, it said. ""Actual toll is much higher,"" the U.N. office said. Share this -

PayPal makes change so Ukrainians can receive funds PayPal users will now be able to send money to Ukrainians, both in the war-ravaged country and those who are now refugees across Europe, the company said Thursday. Previously, people in Ukraine were able to use the payments platform only to send money out of the country. They will now be able to receive funds, as well as make transfers within Ukraine and abroad. It’s the latest measure by banks and other financial services companies looking for ways to help Ukrainians affected by Russia’s invasion. PayPal cut Russia off from its services last week. Since the war began, Americans and other supporters of Ukraine have been looking for ways to financially support Ukrainian refugees, as well as those still in the country. Money transfer companies like MoneyGram and Western Union have had surges in demand as people look for ways to send money to friends and family in the region. PayPal said it will waive fees on transfers of funds to Ukrainian accounts or for anyone receiving funds in Ukrainian accounts until June 30. Share this -

Ukraine says Starlink internet service is in use Ukrainians have started using the satellite internet service Starlink, the country's minister of digital transformation said Thursday on Telegram. Elon Musk, who founded SpaceX, Starlink's parent company, had said on Twitter that he would donate some Starlink receivers to Ukraine. The country has faced significant and scattered disruptions to its internet connectivity since Russia began its invasion late last month. Starlink didn't respond to questions about how many units it had donated to Ukraine or where they would operate. The service, which works by beaming signals from a fleet of low-orbit satellites to dishes connected to internet routers, is designed primarily for use in rural areas. It's unclear how much internet connectivity it can provide in areas that have lost service because its infrastructure was destroyed in the fighting.

A Kremlin climbdown? Ukraine neutrality emerges as potential basis for agreement Russian President Vladimir Putin wanted to bend Ukraine to his will, but a new peace proposal being floated by the Kremlin suggests Moscow may be bowing to reality. Russia has been forced by its own military struggles, unexpectedly fierce Ukrainian resistance and worldwide opposition to scale back its demands three weeks after it invaded its democratic neighbor, experts said. Instead of replacing Kyiv's pro-Western government and permanently crippling its military, Moscow now appears prepared to accept a scenario in which Ukraine commits to being a neutral country with its own armed forces, along the lines of Sweden or Austria. That, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday, ""could be viewed as a certain kind of compromise."" Read the full story.

European Space Agency suspends joint Mars mission with Russia The European Space Agency has suspended a joint mission to Mars with Russia amid a barrage of sanctions against the country over its invasion of Ukraine. ""We deeply deplore the human casualties and tragic consequences of the aggression towards Ukraine. While recognizing the impact on scientific exploration of space, ESA is fully aligned with the sanctions imposed on Russia by its Member States,"" the space agency said in a statement Thursday. Director General Josef Aschbacher called the decision to halt the 2022 ExoMars rover mission, which had been due to launch in September, ""tough — but necessary"" in a tweet. The International Space Station program, however, will continue to ""operate nominally,"" the agency said, adding that the ""main goal is to continue safe operations of the ISS, including maintaining the safety of the crew.""

Arnold Schwarzenegger makes plea to Putin: 'You can stop this war' Arnold Schwarzenegger on Thursday made a direct appeal to Russian President Vladimir Putin: ""You started this war. You are leading this war. You can stop this war."" In a nine-minute video uploaded to Twitter, the former California governor and Hollywood star pleaded with the Russian government, military and civilians to end the bloodshed in Ukraine. ""The strength and the heart of the Russian people have always inspired me,"" said Schwarzenegger, who has a devoted following in Russia. ""That is why I hope that you will let me tell you the truth about the war in Ukraine and what is happening there. ""No one likes to hear something critical of their government, I understand that. But as a longtime friend of the Russian people, I hope that you will hear what I have to say."" He compared Russian soldiers to his father, Gustav Schwarzenegger, a Nazi brownshirt ""pumped up on the lies of his government"" during World War II. He called on everyday Russians to reject Putin's propaganda and falsehoods. ""See, Ukraine did not start this war. Neither did nationalists or Nazis,"" Schwarzenegger said. ""Those in power in the Kremlin started this war. This is not the Russian people's war."" He closed with a direct address to Russians who have protested Putin's invasion of Ukraine. ""The world has seen your bravery. We know that you've suffered the consequences of your courage. You have been arrested. You've been jailed and you've been beaten,"" he said. ""You are my new heroes."" Arnold Schwarzenegger admires the Kremlin during a guided tour in Moscow on Sept. 25, 1996. Alexander Korolkov / AFP via Getty Images file Share this -







Defense Secretary Austin: 'No such thing as a no-fly zone lite' Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Thursday that the United States remains opposed to a no-fly zone over Ukraine due to its potential escalatory effect. ""There's no such thing as a no-fly zone lite,"" he said during a press conference with Slovakia's defense minister. ""A no-fly zone means that you're in a conflict with Russia."" However, he said the U.S. will continue to find other ways to support Ukrainian defense efforts. His counterpart, Slovakian Defense Minister Jaroslav Nad, said his country is willing to provide Ukraine with S-300 missile defense systems, but would only do so after obtaining a ""proper replacement."" Austin also condemned recent Russian attacks, which he said appear to be targeting civilians. Doing so constitutes a war crime, he said, and the State Department is currently reviewing these attacks.

Two Russian strikes destroy huge food storage facility KYIV, Ukraine — It was one of Ukraine's biggest food storage facilities, but now the roof has collapsed, a mesh of metal and wires, and the floor is a blackened mess. The huge facility in Kyiv stored 50,000 tons of food, brought in from across Ukraine before it was picked up by trucks and distributed around the capital. But it was destroyed by two Russian strikes, the second one early Saturday doing the most damage. At the time, 12 workers were in the building. All survived, Ukrainian officials said. A similar food storage facility nearby was also hit, indicating that as its forces continue to meet stiff Ukrainian resistance, Moscow maybe trying to starve the city into submission.

Ukraine won't accept change to its recognized borders, presidential adviser says Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s position on Ukraine’s borders has not changed, a senior adviser said Thursday, amid hopes for progress in negotiations with Russia. Kyiv's position remains that the country's international borders in place when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 must be recognized, presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said in a briefing on Thursday. Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014 but the region is still regarded as part of Ukraine by the United Nations. In the run-up to its invasion last month, Russia also recognized the independence of two breakaway states in the country's east. The fate of those three areas is likely to prove a key sticking point in negotiations. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters earlier Thursday that the two countries were not close to signing any agreement but that the work was continuing. Share this -







U.K. moves to stop 'corrupt elites' using legal system to stifle critics The British government has accelerated plans to strengthen court checks against oligarchs and large businesses who intimidate critics with costly lawsuits, Deputy Prime Ministry Dominic Raab announced on Thursday. “The Government will not tolerate Russian oligarchs and other corrupt elites abusing British courts to muzzle those who shine a light on their wrongdoing,” he said. “We’re taking action to put an end to this bullying and protect our free press,” he added.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said, “For the oligarchs and super-rich who can afford these sky-high costs the threat of legal action has become a new kind of lawfare.” Share this -

Zelenskyy accuses Germany of prioritizing economy over Ukraine's security Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused Germany of prioritizing its economy over the security of his country. Invoking Cold War history, he said that while Ukraine was fighting for its life and freedom, Germany was enjoying peace and liberty. “You're not behind the Berlin Wall now, but you're in the middle of Europe,” Zelenskyy said in an address to the German Parliament on Thursday. He called on Germany not to let a new wall divide Europe and urged support for Ukraine’s membership in the European Union and NATO. “We told you that the Russians were preparing weapons and troops, and we knew that they were preparing for war, but all you cared about was the economy,” he said, referring to Germany's support for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project meant to bring natural gas from Russia, which has now been halted. He also criticized Germany for its delay imposing sanctions. Zelenskyy refers to President Reagan, Berlin Wall in speech to German lawmakers March 17, 2022 02:25 Share this -







U.S. has a clear warning for China: Don’t come to Russia’s aid. Will Beijing heed it? HONG KONG — At high-level talks this week, the United States had a clear warning for China: Don’t come to Russia’s aid in its invasion of Ukraine. China has so far avoided condemning Russian President Vladimir Putin’s attack on Ukraine or calling it an invasion, describing its growing ties with Moscow as “rock solid.” While expressing concern for the humanitarian situation and calling for a peaceful resolution, Beijing has blamed the United States for the Ukraine crisis and said Western countries should respect Russia’s “legitimate security concerns.” It has also amplified a Russian conspiracy theory that the U.S. is funding chemical and biological weapons activity in Ukraine. Analysts say what may appear to be China’s silence or even support for Russia’s actions obscures the complex calculus that it faces on the Ukraine crisis, which has not gone the way it expected.
