0,b4f3510f-6297-44a3-9fb0-abd5cb569f12,['Paul Benjamin Osterlund'],2022-03-30 00:00:00,"Istanbul, Turkey – The sight of Russian and Ukrainian negotiators meeting in Istanbul for direct peace talks highlights the position in which Turkey finds itself as a perceived neutral side in the war in Ukraine.

Turkey could have been in a quandary as two ostensible allies fought a devastating war. Instead, Turkey, a NATO member, continues to supply weapons to Ukraine, while refusing to sanction Russia, and is respected by both sides enough to host Tuesday’s talks.

That balanced position is a continuation of a policy that during the last year has resulted in a rapprochement with a variety of countries in the region with which Turkey has strained or nonexistent relations. Ankara’s diplomatic initiatives have included efforts to mend ties with adversaries including Armenia, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.

Relations have improved across the board. Turkey had long severed ties with its neighbour Armenia; now officials are meeting, and direct flights have resumed. The 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Riyadh’s Istanbul consulate instantly soured Saudi-Turkish relations, but the two sides are now looking to put that behind them, and their foreign ministers met last week.

The deputy foreign ministers of Egypt and Turkey held talks for the second time in 2021 last September in Ankara, while Israeli President Isaac Herzog made a particularly notable visit to the Turkish capital this month, meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. It was the first time an Israeli head of state had paid a visit to Turkey since 2007.

However, it is the improvement in the relationship with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) that is perhaps most interesting, in light of years of tensions between the two countries, which have found themselves on opposing sides in a number of regional disputes.

In November, the UAE promised to invest $10bn in Turkey, funds much needed by Ankara as the country is in the midst of an economic crisis with continually increasing inflation, soaring costs for consumer goods, and weakened purchasing power brought on by the heavy devaluation of the lira.

Erdogan visited Abu Dhabi in February and was greeted with pomp and circumstance, with the world’s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, displaying the Turkish flag, and the Turkish national anthem playing from the Dubai Fountain.

“The fact that Erdogan visited was not shocking for people who had been watching the two countries’ relationship of late,” Monica Marks, professor of Middle East politics at New York University Abu Dhabi, told Al Jazeera. “What did surprise a lot of observers was just how visibly he was feted. You can invite someone without greeting them in such an overtly celebratory fashion.”

Countries such as the UAE are eager to increase economic ties with Turkey, as they seek to benefit financially in light of the latter’s severe economic downturn.

“Turkey is a bargain basement deal right now given the sorry state of the lira, and the UAE has been looking to invest and diversify its investments away from oil for a long time. So investing in different sectors of the Turkish economy is a savvy move from the UAE’s perspective,” Marks added.

‘Zero problems with neighbours’

Turkey’s controversial “policy of zero problems with our neighbours” was the brainchild of former Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, a longtime key Erdogan ally. Davutoglu has since split with Erdogan and formed his own opposition party, but Turkey’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs still features a detailed outline of the policy on its website, touting its achievements.

“I think this policy mostly failed after some initial successes, basically in the aftermath of the Arab Spring when the Turkish government shifted to sectarian policies and really began to support Sunni groups in the Middle East and tried to undermine governments in the region and adopted increasingly revisionist policies,” Berk Esen, assistant professor of political science at Istanbul’s Sabanci University, told Al Jazeera.

Davutoglu’s strategy was centred on a “scapegoating” of Turkish nationalism for Turkey’s problems with its neighbours, according to Esen. The former prime minister said the ruling Justice and Development Party’s (AKP) background in moderate political Islam – rather than nationalism – would be able to resolve Turkey’s regional problems.

Esen argued that Davutoglu’s policies failed, which became the impetus for the wave of Ankara’s rapprochement efforts.

“I think the main motivating factor going beyond political and economic goals is the failure of the old policies. With the collapse of Turkey’s revisionist agenda over the last couple of years, I think it became quite clear to Erdogan that his government’s previous foreign policy steps were no longer sustainable and that something needed to be done,” Esen said.

Others posit the “zero problems” policy was established prior to the emergence of a fraught political context that did not allow it to be fully realised.

“When the policy was rolled out, the Middle East had a different zeitgeist than it does today. The policy didn’t survive long enough to evaluate it as a success or failure due to the Arab Spring, which resulted in a seismic geopolitical shift for the region,” Yusuf Erim, editor-at-large at Turkey’s English-language state broadcaster TRT World, told Al Jazeera.

“The rise of Daesh [ISIL] and two major conflicts on Turkey’s borders required a change towards a forward-deployed diplomatic posture to deal with new security threats and instability across the border. Today, there are new realities as the region is undergoing a wave of rapprochement,” Erim added.

Ukraine balancing act

Turkey’s most critical relationships at the moment are undoubtedly those with Kyiv and Moscow, with Turkey’s political and geographic position accelerating Erdoğan’s agency in the broader region and vis-a-vis the West.

“Erdogan has been sort of cast aside almost as a pariah in the international arena for the last couple of years. Biden refused to talk to him. In major summits, Erdogan cast a lonely profile. But things have really changed it seems, since the beginning of the Russian invasion in Ukraine,” Esen said.

Ankara’s primary aim now appears to be regional stability, with the knowledge that any other outcome might mean further financial hardship.

“Turkey is probably one of the countries that takes a direct hit as a result of this instability,” Erim said. “Turkey has not taken part in sanctions because it understands that those sanctions will probably hurt Turkey just as much as they will hurt Russia, so Turkey wants to continue to take a balanced position and it will do this as long as possible as long as Russia does not cross any serious red lines.”

“Turkey is very vested in being able to broker peace,” said Erim, “because it would be one of the big winners if peace is able to be established between these two players.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/30/turkey-a-mediator-in-ukraine-mends-its-own-ties-with-neighbours

“Today Ukraine is facing horrible humanitarian catastrophe. I feel sorry for Minister Shaked, who forgot that the Jewish people have been refugees for all of their lives. Unfortunately the lessons of history already forgotten. Let me remind you [of] the case of the St.Louis - a vessel boarded with Jews who were trying to escape the horrors of war in Europe and failed to find a safe harbor,” Yevgen Korniychuk said at the opening of a photography exhibition about the war.

The MS St. Louis was a passenger ship carrying hundreds of Jewish refugees which was turned back by various western countries, including Cuba and the United States, before returning its passengers to Europe in 1939.

“Today Ukrainians is facing artificial obstacles to enter Israel and escape horrors of war,” Korniychuk said, stating that he believed most Israelis agreed with him and calling on “the Israeli government to wake up and accompany the spirit of the Jewish people in their actions.”

Korniychuk’s comments came a day after the state informed Israel's High Court that it will continue to restrict the entry of Ukrainian refugees who are not eligible for immigration to Israel under the Law of Return and have no relatives in the country, despite the existence of a visa-free travel agreement between Jerusalem and Kyiv.

Israel's quota for Ukrainian refugees who are ineligible for Israeli citizenship and have no relatives in Israel is 5,000 – though the state said it would allow 20 additional refugees in this category to enter per day, even if the quota is exceeded.",https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/LIVE-ukraine-says-it-reseized-towns-near-kyiv-ahead-of-peace-talks-in-turkey-1.10705208
2,b4f3510f-6297-44a3-9fb0-abd5cb569f12,[],,"The content optimism of the previous day has been partially justified at the negotiating table in Istanbul. Hosted by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the talks between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations produced a timid rapprochement, defined by the two initial positions adopted by the parties: Moscow's reduction of military activities in Ukraine and Kiev's definitive renunciation of NATO membership. A starting point conditioned by Vladimir Putin's incessant aggression.

The three-hour meeting served as a thermometer to measure the temperature of the negotiating teams, prone to dialogue after five weeks of invasion. The full-scale Russian offensive has failed miserably, with only one oblast capital, Kherson, under control and even losing positions in recent days. Ukrainian forces have repelled the advance with force, still encapsulated in several enclaves in the country. But the aggression has provoked an unprecedented humanitarian crisis, leaving behind almost four million displaced people, in addition to thousands of unquantified fatalities.

Erdoğan called at the outset for ""concrete results"" in what was the first high-level meeting in three weeks, and the most successful to date. In all this time, the negotiating teams had not seen each other face-to-face, but had seen each other on screen. Videoconference talks have been commonplace, but have been shrouded in the utmost secrecy by the parties. And they promise to continue in the coming days.

Scheduled to end on Wednesday, the negotiations finally ended on Tuesday with a considerable distance between the two delegations. Peace in Ukraine does not seem close, but this was the first contact that at least raised expectations. Present at the talks, the Russian Minister of Culture, Vladimir Medinsky, who is of Ukrainian origin, assessed the meeting as a ""constructive"" step in the search for a compromise. President Zelensky's chief advisor, Mykhailo Podolyak, also described the meeting as ""constructive"".

Two significant developments have emerged from Tuesday's meeting that give cause for optimism. Russia assures that it will ""drastically reduce"" its military activity in the northern city of Chernobyl, close to the border with Belarus, and in the capital, Kiev, which is heavily besieged but still under the control of Ukrainian forces. This was announced by Russian Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin, the 'number two' of the recently reappeared Sergey Shoigu, who was also present at the negotiations.

Ukraine, for its part, definitively renounces NATO membership, as well as the right to host military bases and armaments belonging to the Atlantic Alliance, thus acquiring a neutral status. These conditions were accepted in exchange for a series of defensive guarantees. The Kiev government would henceforth be able to count on military assistance from a small group of countries in the event of a new Russian attack, including Turkey, Israel, Poland and Canada. There would be no veto in such a scenario for hypothetical EU membership.

The central issue in the negotiations now becomes the territorial status of the Crimean peninsula, annexed by Russia in 2014, and the Donbass, which is partially occupied by separatist militias backed by Russian troops. The recent U-turn by the Russian defence ministry, which said it had completed 'the first phase' of the offensive and would focus its military action on the Lugansk and Donetsk oblasts, puts the spotlight on the situation in both regions, which will be the subject of new demands from the Kremlin.

But there is no room for hope as long as hostilities on the ground have not ceased. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has questioned Moscow's concessions. With this move, Russia may be buying time to regroup its forces and supply troops deployed in the eastern part of the country, who are hampered by logistical problems. Although early reports have echoed a timid withdrawal of forces to the periphery of some cities by the Russian army, the attacks continue.

Plumes of smoke and debris remain the norm in artillery-ravaged Ukraine. The devastating siege of Mariupol is about to take effect, allowing Russian forces to cut off the exit to the Sea of Azov, establishing a corridor between the Crimean peninsula and the Donbass, encapsulating Ukrainian troops. A scenario that would strengthen its position at the negotiating table.

It is important not to lose focus. According to Amnesty International, the Russian army is alleged to have committed war crimes in Ukraine by applying scorched-earth military tactics. A common Kremlin strategy, previously used in Chechnya and Syria. Agnes Callamard, the organisation's secretary general, said that Amnesty International has documented ""an escalation of violations of human rights and humanitarian law, including indiscriminate or deliberate attacks against civilians"".

Putin and Zelenski, face to face?

The negotiating teams see a summit between Vladimir Putin and Volodymir Zelensky as possible. ""The results of today's meeting are sufficient for a meeting at the leaders' level,"" declared a member of the Ukrainian delegation at the end of the negotiations in Istanbul. David Arakhamia was not the only one to make such a statement; the Kremlin's negotiating staff also expressed this view a day after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that a meeting would be ""counterproductive"" without advanced agreements on the table.

But Washington remains Moscow's preferred interlocutor. ""Sooner or later we will have to talk to the United States,"" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Relations between the White House and the Kremlin are not broken, despite the coarse words of President Joe Biden, who called Putin a ""butcher"" and said he could not be in power for another minute. These statements were later qualified by members of his administration.

French President Emmanuel Macron advocated a different approach to Vladimir Putin in order not to encourage escalation. The French leader, who is up for re-election in two weeks in a decisive context for Europe in which he wants to assume political leadership of the continent, will hold a new telephone conversation with the Russian president on Tuesday afternoon to discuss the humanitarian situation.

Speaking to reporters, Çavuşoğlu hailed the Russia-Ukraine peace talks, saying that Tuesday's meeting marked the ""most meaningful progress since the start of negotiations.""

""The Russia-Ukraine meeting shows the confidence of both countries in Turkey,"" he said.

The Turkish foreign minister noted that more advanced issues are expected to be discussed by the foreign ministers of both countries and this would be followed by a meeting between the two presidents.

He said he is pleased to see an increasing rapprochement between the Russian and Ukrainian sides at every stage after the talks.

Çavuşoğlu noted that Turkey encouraged both sides to reach a cease-fire as soon as possible. He also said they touched upon the issue of a humanitarian corridor and the Turkish vessels stranded in the area.

The Russian and Ukrainian delegations arrived in Istanbul on Monday and met at the Dolmabahçe working office in Istanbul’s Beşiktaş district.

Ankara hosted the foreign ministers of Russia and Ukraine in Antalya earlier this month. Foreign Ministers Sergey Lavrov of Russia and Dmytro Kuleba of Ukraine met for talks in the Turkish resort town of Antalya, which Çavuşoğlu also attended. The talks were largely inconclusive, but Ankara considers the fact that they took place at all a success.

Maintaining its neutral and balanced stance, Turkey continues its diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the Ukraine conflict, urging all sides to exercise restraint. While Ankara has opposed international sanctions designed to isolate Moscow, it also closed its straits to prevent some Russian vessels from crossing through them.

NATO ally Turkey borders Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea and has good ties with both. Since the beginning of the conflict, Ankara has offered to mediate between the two sides and host peace talks, underlining its support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty. Having recently called Russia’s invasion an unacceptable violation of international law, Turkey has carefully formulated its rhetoric not to offend Moscow, with which it has close energy, defense and tourism ties.

While forging close ties with Russia in a number of areas and relying heavily on Russian tourists, Turkey has sold drones to Ukraine, which angered Moscow. Turkey also opposes Russian policies in Syria and Libya, as well as Moscow's annexation of Crimea. President Erdoğan has repeatedly said Turkey will not abandon its relations with Russia or Ukraine, underlining that Ankara's ability to speak to both sides is an asset.

The Russia-Ukraine war, which started on Feb. 24, has met international outrage with the European Union, the United States and the United Kingdom, among others, imposing tough financial sanctions on Moscow.",https://www.dailysabah.com/politics/diplomacy/consensus-reached-on-some-issues-between-russia-ukraine-cavusoglu

US to move troops and aircraft to Eastern Europe

US armed forces are moving aircraft and soldiers to Eastern Europe, Defense Department spokesperson John Kirby said on Tuesday.

This includes a unit of around 200 marines which has been moved to Lithuania from Norway, Kirby said.

Ten F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets and a few C-130 Hercules transport planes, as well as some 200 associated soldiers, will be brought to Eastern Europe from the US. Kirby said that they would be moved shortly but that their precise destination remained unclear.

US says some Russian troops leaving Kyiv region

Following the announcement earlier on Tuesday that Russia would cut back on its military actions around Kyiv and Chernihiv, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said that the US believed some Russian troops had already left.

""Has there been some movement by some Russian units away from Kyiv in the last day or so? Yes, we think so. Small numbers,"" Kirby told reporters.

""But we believe that this is a repositioning, not a real withdrawal, and that we all should be prepared to watch for a major offensive against other areas of Ukraine. It does not mean that the threat to Kyiv is over,"" he added.

Biden voices skepticism over Russia's pledge to cut activities

US President Joe Biden said he wasn't convinced that Russia's promise to cut back military operations around Kyiv will lead to a significant change in the conflict.

""We'll see if they follow through,"" he told reporters after holding a phone call with the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Italy.

""There seems to be a consensus that let's just see what they have to offer.""

Russian negotiators pledged to scale back hostilities near Kyiv and the city of Chernihiv during talks with Ukraine in Turkey on Tuesday.

France says no Mariupol humanitarian mission possible 'at this stage'

The conditions for carrying out a humanitarian operation sought by France to help civilians in the besieged port city of Mariupol have not been met ""at this stage,"" French President Emmanuel Macron's office said.

The French leader spoke to his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in a phone call on Tuesday.

Macron had outlined the mission sought alongside Turkey and Greece to Putin, who said ""he was going to think about it"" before responding, an Elysee Palace official said.

Mariupol has been one of the worst struck cities since the start of the Ukraine war with the local mayor saying it is now ""on the brink of humanitarian catastrophe.""

The Russian president also told Macron that Ukrainian ""nationalists"" in besieged Mariupol must lay down their arms.

""It was stressed that in order to resolve the difficult humanitarian situation in this city (Mariupol), Ukrainian nationalist militants must stop resisting and lay down their arms,"" the Kremlin said in a statement about the call.

The two presidents also discussed Russia's decision to request payments in rubles for Russian gas supplies to the EU, the statement added.

Russia-backed Donetsk considers joining Russia

The head of the so-called Donetsk People's Republic — a part of Ukraine controlled by Russian-backed separatists since 2014 — has said the region will consider joining Russia, according to the Donetsk News Agency.

""As for joining the Russian Federation, as for this wish and drive, they have been obvious since 2014 — the wish to be in Russia,"" Denis Pushilin said.

Moscow recognized the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics on February 24, just days before Russian troops invaded Ukraine.

Pushilin's comments come two days after Russian-backed rebels in Luhansk said they may hold a referendum on joining Russia. Kyiv said such a move would not have legal basis and warned of an international response.

The Ukrainian soldier, whose comments to a Russian warship went viral, has returned home.

Roman Hrybov was taken prisoner by Russian forces while he was serving on the so-called Snake Island (Zmiinyi Island in Ukrainian), a small island in the Black Sea.

A recording of Hrybov telling a Russian warship to ""go f*** yourself"" went viral.

The Ukrainian troops stationed on the island were at first presumed to have been killed in an attack. It later turned out they had been taken captive and were exchanged for Russian prisoners.

The Ukrainian military shared a picture of the soldier receiving a medal on social media. They said he has returned to ""his native Cherkasy region.""

Russia files two cases against Google over banned content

Russia has filed two legal cases against Alphabet Inc, which owns Google, for failure to remove banned information from its YouTube video-sharing platform, the country's communication regulator said on Tuesday.

Roskomnadzor accused the tech giant of blatantly promoting false content about Russia's invasion, which the Kremlin calls a ""special military operation.""

It said YouTube had become one of the key platforms in the ""information war"" against Moscow.

The regulator added that Google could be fined up to 8 million rubles ($91,533; €82,500), or as much as 20% of the company's annual revenue in Russia for repeat offenses.

Russia has blocked Google News and restricted access to Twitter, Facebook and Instagram

US skeptical of Russian gestures

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken questioned the seriousness of Russia's claims of progress at the Ukraine-Russia talks in Turkey on Tuesday.

""I've not seen anything to suggest that this is moving forward in an effective way because we have not seen signs of real seriousness"" from Russia, Blinken said during an official visit to Morocco.

""There is what Russia says and there is what Russia does. We're focussed on the latter,"" he added.

""If they somehow believe that an effort to subjugate ""only,"" in quotation marks, the eastern part of Ukraine and the southern part of Ukraine can succeed, then once again they are profoundly fooling themselves,"" CNN quoted Blinken as saying.

He once again called on Russia to end the fighting and said the Ukrainians were engaged in negotiations ""with a gun literally to their heads.""

Asked about Russia's promise to scale back their armed forces around the cities of Kyiv and Chernihiv, the spokesman said: ""We will judge [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and his regime by his actions, not by his words.""

""There has been some reduction in Russian bombardment around Kyiv, largely because Ukrainian forces have been successfully pushing back the Russian offensives in the northwest of the city,"" he told reporters.

""But fighting continues. There's heavy bombardment in Mariupol and other areas. So we don't want to see anything less than a complete withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukrainian territory.""

""Experience shows that Russia does not leave such measures unanswered. We cannot speculate on that, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is prepared for various scenarios that may occur in the near future,"" he said in a statement.

Shortly after the Dutch announcement, Belgian Foreign Minister Sophie Wilmes said Belgium was also expelling 21 Russian diplomats for actions related to espionage or unlawful influence peddling.

Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney later said Ireland was expelling four Russian diplomats whose activities have not been ""in accordance with international standards of diplomatic behavior.""

Generally, the whole EU has to agree on sanctions imposed in the bloc, and Brussels could potentially punish members states acting unilaterally.

Russian representatives not welcome at Buchenwald commemoration

German officials have told Russian and Belarusian diplomatic representatives that they are not welcome at the commemoration for the 77th anniversary of the liberation of the Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora Nazi concentration camps.

""We have informed the consular representations in writing that they are not welcome at the events,"" director of the Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora Memorials Foundation, Jens-Christian Wagner, said on Tuesday.

One reason for the move was the death of the 96-year-old Buchenwald camp survivor Boris Romanchenko.

Romanchenko, who had previously served as vice-president for the international committee of survivors for the two camps, was killed by Russian bombardments in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv in mid-March.

The Nazi camps were liberated by US troops on April 11, 1945, shortly before the end of the Second World War.

Amnesty International accuses Russia of war crimes in Ukraine

Agnes Callamard, secretary-general of the human rights organization, told DW that Amnesty has been ""documenting an escalation of human rights and humanitarian law violations, including the indiscriminate or deliberate targeting of civilians.""

""Russia's crackdown on freedom of speech started before the aggression against Ukraine,"" Callamard said. She pointed to ""the shrinking space for independent media and dissenting voices,"" which she said goes back to at least 2021.

She added that disinformation and propaganda are part of the war, making it difficult to keep track of what is actually going on.

Watch video 06:52 Human rights in 2021: Amnesty's Callamard speaks with DW

Callamard also insisted that ""the standards that are applied to … Ukrainian refugees are applied across the board to others.""

""As we speak right now, there are refugees stuck between Belarus and Poland who are denied entry into Poland,"" she added, saying that the failure to support those refugees mean that the west was ""losing a war of values.""

She added that as an outcome of the war, many countries will experience food shortages and skyrocketing prices, exacerbated by the failures of governments to ""build back better"" after the coronavirus pandemic. ""That is the betrayal of 2021,"" she told DW.

UNHCR: More than 3.9 people fled Ukraine

The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said 3,901,713 people have fled the war in Ukraine — an increase of 38,916 from Monday's figure.

UNHCR spokesman Matthew Saltmarsh told reporters that the number of refugees was ""unprecedented since World War II in Europe, certainly in terms of the speed and scale of the displacement.""

Francesco Rocca, the president of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), said refugees were arriving exhausted and feeling ""hopeless.""

""We are seeing millions of people arriving at borders, their coping capacities stretched by what they have experienced and witnessed,"" he said.

""People are understandably tired and stressed, physically, mentally and emotionally.""

Oil prices fall, shares head higher

With apparent progress in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, oil prices shed over 5%, and world share markets and global borrowing costs surged.

European benchmark Brent crude dived 6.6%, and New York's WTI oil slid 5.2%.

Europe's major stock markets jumped higher. Frankfurt soared 3.5%, Paris 3.1% and London 1.2 %.

Wall Street's main indexes also opened higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 0.45%. The S&P 500 opened higher by 0.60%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.01% at the opening bell.

""It is the first time in this conflict where we have seen any indications for any form of easing of military action from the Russian side,"" SEB analyst Bjarne Schieldrop told the AFP news agency.

""Now for the first time the market is hoping that there might actually be a way forward not being a full destruction and takeover of Ukraine.""

Russia expels 10 diplomats from the Baltic states

Russia's Foreign Ministry said Moscow has expelled 10 diplomats from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in a tit-for-tat response to the Baltic states' recent expulsion of 10 Russian diplomats.

Moscow has now summoned the ambassadors of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to lodge a ""firm protest in view of the provocative and unjustified actions.""

Biden to speak with European allies

The White House said US President Joe Biden would discuss the war in Ukraine with the leaders of Germany, France, Italy and Britain on Tuesday.

The phone call is due to start at 9:15 a.m. (1315 UTC), the White House said.

Separately, the Kremlin said on Tuesday Russia has maintained communication with Washington despite Biden's recent statement on Putin, in which he called him a ""butcher.""

The ""personal insults"" made by Biden against Putin have had a ""negative impact"" on relations between the two countries, Kremlin spokesman Dimitry Peskov said, according to the Russian Interfax news agency.

""Nevertheless, the dialogue between Russia and the US is necessary in any case,"" Peskov added. ""It is not only in the interest of both countries, but in the interest of the whole world.""

According to the AP news agency, Ukraine's military said it had noted withdrawals around Kyiv and Chernihiv. However, the Pentagon said it could not confirm the reports.

Turkey said Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers were expected to meet in the next phase to set a mutual understanding and set the stage for a meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin.

""We are extremely happy to see an increased rapprochement between the two sides at every stage,"" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said.

Russia-Ukraine talks conclude in Istanbul

Ukrainian and Russian negotiators concluded face-to-face peace talks in Istanbul on Tuesday, with the Ukrainian side saying that there have been enough developments to have a meeting between the presidents of the two countries.

Russia said the talks were ""constructive,"" raising hopes that there could be progress toward ending the war.

However, Russian top negotiator Medinsky said a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy is possible only if a deal has been approved by the foreign ministries of both countries.

Following the talks, Ukrainian negotiators told reporters that Kyiv would agree to a neutral status if a security guarantee system is put in place. They said, under the new system, Israel, Poland, Canada and Turkey could be among Ukraine’s security guarantors.

The neutral status would include not hosting any foreign military bases on Ukrainian territory.

There needs to be full peace across Ukraine for any final agreement with Russia to come into force, the Ukrainian side stressed, adding that a referendum would be needed in Ukraine on the terms of any final deal.

They also proposed holding consultations with Russia on the status of Crimea.

The talks on Tuesday lasted around four hours with occasional breaks. It is unclear if the discussions will continue for a second day.

Russia says rules for gas payments in rubles will be ready in days

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was working out practical arrangements for foreign companies and governments to pay for Russian gas in rubles.

Peskov said the plan would be ready by Thursday, in line with Russian President Vladimir Putin's set deadline.

""No one will supply gas for free, it is simply impossible, and you can pay for it only in rubles,"" Peskov told reporters on Tuesday.

He added that ""all modalities are being developed so that this system is simple, understandable and feasible for respected European and international buyers.""

Peskov's remarks came a day after Germany said the G7 nations rejected Putin's demand to pay for Russian gas in rubles. Berlin said the demand was a breach of the pre-agreed terms and conditions.

Zelenskyy addresses Danish parliament, urges tightening sanctions

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed Danish lawmakers on Tuesday, saying that the EU must tighten sanctions on Russia. He urged European countries to cut off all trade with Russia, including a ban on Russian energy supplies.

Speaking via video link, Zelenskyy said of the Russian invasion that ""the brutality is more violent than what we have seen during World War II.""

The Ukrainian leader has so far made online speeches to lawmakers in several countries, including the United States, Britain, Germany and Japan, among others.

Russian rocket hits Mykolaiv government building

A Russian rocket strike on Tuesday destroyed a regional government building in the southern city of Mykolaiv, local authorities said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the missile strike killed at least seven people and wounded 22.

""We're clearing the rubble. Half the building was destroyed. My office was hit,"" local governor Vitaliy Kim said in a video statement.

Mykolaiv, a key port, has been under heavy assault for weeks, along with other southern port cities like Kherson and Mariupol.

Peace talks focusing on security guarantees, cease-fire, says Zelenskyy adviser

Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has said that the ongoing talks in Turkey between Ukraine and Russia are focusing on security guarantees for Ukraine and a cease-fire.

""Only with this agreement can we end the war in a way that Ukraine needs,"" he said. Podolyak added the two sides were also discussing alleged breaches of the rules of war.

Russia says the military's main task is now to 'liberate' Donbas

Russia's defense minister Sergei Shoigu said on Tuesday that Ukraine's military capacity had been seriously degraded, the Interfax news agency reported. ""The combat potential of the Ukrainian armed forces has been significantly reduced, which makes it possible to focus the main attention and main efforts on achieving the main goal — the liberation of Donbas.""

Shoigu's assertion came despite Ukraine's unexpectedly strong resistance since the war began last month, which has seen Russia fail to take any major cities, and stall in advancing along multiple fronts.

However, Shoigu reiterated statements made last week by officials that the Russian military had completed the main objective of the first phase of its invasion.

The minister also stressed the change in Russia's war aims, underlining that the main task of the Russian military is now to ""liberate"" Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, part of which has been under the control of Russian proxies since 2014.

Furthermore, he warned the West that Moscow will respond appropriately if NATO supplies fighter aircraft and air defense systems to Ukraine.

Russia resumes LNG exports through the Sea of Azov

Russia on Tuesday resumed exports of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) through the Sea of Azov, with a Comoros-flagged gas tanker expected to be loaded at the port of Temryuk, the port operator said.

The tanker, bound for the Bulgarian port of Burgas, would mark the first time since the start of Russia’s Ukraine invasion that LNG is exported through the waterway.

Russian authorities had banned ship movements in the region following the outbreak of the war.

IAEA chief in Ukraine to talk about nuclear safety

The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has arrived in Ukraine to hold talks with senior officials on how to ensure the safety of the nation's nuclear facilities.

""The military conflict is putting Ukraine's nuclear power plants and other facilities with radioactive material in unprecedented danger,"" Mariano Grossi, the head of the UN nuclear watchdog said in a statement.

He added that ""there have already been several close calls. We can't afford to lose any more time.""

Ukraine has 15 nuclear reactors at four active power plants, and also is home to the decommissioned Chernobyl plant, the site of the 1986 nuclear disaster. Russian forces have taken control of Chernobyl and of the largest active power plant, at Zaporizhzhia.

Ukraine says it's resuming evacuations from conflict-affected areas

Ukraine said Tuesday it was reopening humanitarian corridors and evacuating civilians from war-scarred regions after a one-day pause over what Kyiv called possible Russian ""provocations.""

""Three humanitarian corridors were agreed for today,"" Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in a video statement posted on Telegram, a day after announcing their closure citing intelligence reports.

US to deploy fighter jets to Germany to boost NATO posture

The United States is deploying six Navy EA-18G Growler aircraft to the Spangdahlem airbase in Germany to bolster NATO's defense posture, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said.

This is ""to bolster readiness and NATO's collective defense posture and further increase air integration capabilities with our Allied and partner nations,"" he said during a conference call.

Kirby stressed that the aircraft were not intended to be used against the Russian military in Ukraine, but were intended to strengthen NATO's eastern flank and serve as a deterrent against Russia.

Kirby added that some 240 Navy personnel, consisting of pilots and maintenance crew, will also be stationed to maintain the aircraft.

The aircraft, developed by the US firm Boeing, are used in electronic warfare to counter adversaries by offering tactical jamming capabilities besides offering land and naval defense.

Kirby stressed that the EA-18G Growler aircraft were intended to strengthen NATO's eastern flank and serve as a deterrent against Russia

Russia, Ukraine talks begin in Turkey

Talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators to end the conflict have started in Istanbul. Addressing the negotiators, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said both Russia’s President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy are ""valuable friends.""

""We have entered a time when talks need to yield concrete results,"" he stressed, calling for an immediate cease-fire.

""A fair peace will not have a loser and continuing the conflict benefits no one,"" he underlined.

US says Asia complying with Russia sanctions

The US has said Asian nations and firms are complying with export controls imposed on Russia by the West due to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Some companies are even ""self-sanctioning,"" Matthew Borman, US Commerce Department deputy assistant secretary for export administration, was quoted by Reuters as saying on Tuesday.

""The restrictions have been in place for roughly a month, a little bit over a month, and we certainly haven't seen any indication that there's non-compliance, in fact, we've seen the reverse,"" he said.

""I think there's also a fair amount of additional self-sanctioning, if you will, by multinational companies operating in Russia,"" the official added.

""We know that Russia is quite dependent upon foreign supplies for some key inputs like semiconductors so I think it will be relatively readily apparent if there is non-compliance and the task will be to trace that back to its origin.""

IAEA: Kharkiv nuclear facility intact despite shelling

The Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Rafael Mariano Grossi said that the ""small amount of nuclear material"" at the Kharkiv nuclear research facility ""remained intact"" despite shelling.

Australia announces first Magnitsky sanctions

Australia's Minister of Foreign Affairs Marise Payne announced the country's first Magnitsky-style sanctions.

The newest sanctions will target ""Russian individuals responsible for the corruption that Sergei Magnitsky uncovered and those complicit in his subsequent mistreatment and death.""

In a press release, the Australian government explained Magnitsky was ""a Ukrainian-born Russian lawyer and tax advisor,"" who ""uncovered widespread corruption by Russian tax and law enforcement officials. He was imprisoned and mistreated, and died in custody in November 2009, after being refused medical treatment.""

The Australian Foreign Ministry said, ""In this first tranche, the Government will honour Mr Magnitsky and all who defend the rule of law, with targeted sanctions and travel bans against 14 Russian individuals responsible for the serious corruption that he exposed and a further 25 Russian perpetrators and accomplices of his abuse and death.""

Zelenskyy: Situation tense despite some victories

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the situation remains tense despite some Ukrainian victories following Russia's invasion of his country on February 24.

Russian forces have been repelled from the Kyiv suburb of Irpin, Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation published via his Telegram channel.

Zelenskyy said Russian forces are attempting to regroup amid heavy losses

However, fighting continues in Kyiv as well as in other parts of the country.

Russian troops remain in control of Kyiv's northern suburbs. The situation remains ""very difficult"" in the Chernihiv, Sumy, Donbass and southern regions.

Zelenskyy added that further tightening of sanctions on Russia to include oil supplies to Europe were only likely to take place if Russia makes use of chemical weapons in its war effort.

""There are no words for that,"" Zelenskyy said.

Summary of Monday's events in Ukraine-Russia crisis

Ukrainian and Russian delegations are due to meet in Istanbul on Tuesday.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he made separate calls to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin that were progressing in a ""positive direction.''

He did not give more detail but added that he would meet Ukrainian and Russian delegations ahead of their talks.

Ukraine's foreign minister Dmtryo Kuleba said a cease-fire was the most his country could hope for from the latest peace talks with Russia.

""The minimum program will be humanitarian questions, and the maximum program is reaching an agreement on a cease-fire,"" Kuleba said. ""We are not trading people, land or sovereignty.""

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia expected no breakthrough at the talks.

The Financial Times reports in exchange for giving up on its plan to join NATO, Ukraine will be free to join the EU.

Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich and Ukrainian peace negotiators suffered symptoms of suspected poisoning earlier this month after a meeting in Kyiv, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported.

The WSJ report said Abramovich, who accepted a Ukrainian request to help negotiate an end to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and at least two senior members of the Ukrainian team, were affected.

Ukrainian authorities said Russian missiles struck another fuel depot in the northwest of the country. More than 1,000 Russian mercenaries connected to the Wagner Group are deployed in eastern Ukraine, UK military intelligence said.

Russia's Novaya Gazeta newspaper said it would stop publishing until the war in Ukraine ends. The leading independent publication, edited by Nobel Peace Prize winner Dmitry Muratov, said it was taking the step after receiving a second warning from the media regulator Roskomnadzor.

If a media outlet receives two warnings from the communications regulator, a court can shut it down.

Meanwhile, the G7 rejected Russia's demand for gas payment in rubles.

5,b4f3510f-6297-44a3-9fb0-abd5cb569f12,[],2022-03-31 00:00:00,"After more than a month of fighting, a fresh round of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine has begun in Istanbul in the hope that progress can be made. Following weeks of fruitless talks in Belarus, negotiations were hosted by the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who made a short opening statement telling both sides: “The world is waiting for good news, and good news from you.”

The very fact that talks have moved from Belarus, a key Russian ally, to Turkey is an indication that things have changed and that Russia’s military position is not as strong as it had originally hoped for. Meanwhile, the decision to hold the meetings in Turkey make sense for a number of reasons.

It’s not the first time the two sides have met since the invasion on February 24. Turkey hosted a meeting in Antalya on March 10 between the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and his opposite number, Ukraine’s Dmytro Kuleba. The talks took place against a backdrop of worsening violence across Ukraine and were largely unfruitful, except as an opportunity for the two sides to send messages to the watching world.

Lavrov said that the US and its allies had forced Ukraine to choose between Russia and the west. Kuleba, meanwhile, appealed for Russia to allow the evacuation of civilians from Mariupol, which was – and remains – under heavy bombardment.

Now the talks have returned to Turkey – this time to Istanbul. The Nato member has plenty of recent history with Russia going back several years. Turkey has always feared Russian interference in the strategic Bosphorous and Dardanelles, which is why it joined the western alliance in 1952. Russia’s annexation of Crimea also worried Ankara as it increased its influence in the Black Sea region. This much was evidenced when Turkey closed the Bosphorus Strait to warships at the end of February.

Russia’s involvement in Syria introduced tensions between the two countries. In November 2015, Turkey shot down a Russian warplane near its border with Syria. Turkey said the aircraft was in its airspace at the time and had ignored warnings to leave. Russia insisted the aircraft had remained within Syria’s borders and had received no warnings. For a few days there were fears of a confrontation, which would have been the first between Russia and a Nato member.

The two countries started to patch things up in 2016, against a backdrop of a deterioration of relations between Turkey and the US over Washington’s support for Kurdish militias in Syria. In July of that year, after an attempted coup by a faction of the Turkish army, Putin was quick to express solidarity with Erdoğan, who then made Russia his first port of call after the coup. Erdoğan also apologised to Russia for the shooting down of its aircraft, offering compensation to the family of the Russian pilot who died.

In 2017, Turkey concluded a US$2.5 billion (£1.9 billion) deal with Russia to purchase the S-400 mobile surface-to-air missile system. For Nato, the prospect of Russian systems being integrated into Nato’s larger defence structure were extremely worrying. The then Trump administration duly imposed sanctions on Russia. Relations hit rock bottom.

To complicate things further, in 2019 Bayraktar – a company owned by Erdoğan’s son-in-law Selçuk Bayraktar – started to sell to Ukraine its combat drone Bayraktar TB2. These are cheaper than their western equivalents but have inflicted a great deal of pain on Russian convoys, surprising military analysts.

Playing the honest broker

This history has given Turkey a unique position as a host for talks. Being seen to help resolve the crisis in Ukraine will no doubt help Ankara improve its relations with the west, which seems ready to pursue a degree of rapprochement with one eye on what Turkey could do to help with instability in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as developments in the South Caucasus and Afghanistan.

Turkey also needs to keep on the good side of Russia. It was recently suggested that Turkey might supply Ukraine with the Russian S-400 systems it purchased in 2017. But this would irredeemably jeopardise relations with Russia, which would be the last thing Ankara wants given the extent to which Turkey’s economy benefits from good relations with Moscow.

Russian tourists nowadays dominate Turkey’s tourism sector representing 28% of all tourists. In addition, Turkey relies on Russia for 45% of its natural gas, 17% of oil and 40% of its gasoline.

So, faced with a need to improve relations with both Russia and the west, playing the role of mediator in Ukraine will suit Erdoğan’s purposes well. The country also has a track record of mediation in the Middle East and the Caucasus and is an acknowledged Black Sea power, as its closure of the Turkish Straits shortly after the Russian invasion clearly demonstrates.

These are high stakes for Erdoğan to play for. So much could go wrong, but if Turkey emerges as having played a key role in ending Russian violence against Ukraine, then its status as a first-level power in the region will have been secured.

6,b4f3510f-6297-44a3-9fb0-abd5cb569f12,"['Tom Clonan', 'David Quinn', 'Larry Donnelly', 'Marc Mc Menamin']",,"THE INVASION OF Ukraine has reached a turning point. In recent days, the Russian general staff announced that they would concentrate their activities in the ‘special military operation’ in the Donbass in Eastern Ukraine.

On Tuesday afternoon in Istanbul, Russia’s Deputy Defence Minister, General Alexander Fomin announced a ‘reduction’ in military activities ‘towards’ Kyiv and Chernihiv. The Ukrainian delegation have confirmed Russian troop withdrawals from positions north of the Capital Kyiv.

Both sides in the peace talks in Istanbul have expressed cautious optimism about the talks, with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevut Cavusoglu stating “we are extremely happy to see an increased rapprochement between both sides at every stage”.

The hope is that the Istanbul talks may lead to a possible meeting between Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and Russia’s Sergei Lavrov. Ultimately, the goal would be a face-to-face meeting between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and President Vladimir Putin.

Whilst the diplomatic and political ground appears to be shifting, the military situation on the ground has remained somewhat static. Russia’s advance on Kyiv – and on Zelenskyy and his government – has failed.

Putin’s intelligence assessment presumably led him to believe that his massive armoured column (stretched out over 40 miles) would roll into Kyiv city centre within 24 hours of crossing the start-line. In the early hours of the invasion – in a parallel operation – a ‘kill team’ of Russian special forces was dispatched to Kyiv to capture or kill Zelenskyy and other key members of his cabinet and senior military leadership in order to effect a swift regime change and surrender.

However, Russian forces failed to take the airport at Kyiv and none of the elements of their original plan survived contact with the Ukrainian military. Over a month after the invasion, Kyiv remains intact and Zelenskyy remains at large – leading Ukrainian resistance against Putin’s aggression.

In the east and south of the country, Russian forces have managed to consolidate their grip on the Donbass region. Critically, Russian troops have – slowly but surely – fought their way from the Crimean Peninsula towards Luhansk and Donetsk. If Mariupol falls in the coming days, the Russians will have succeeded in establishing a land corridor from Crimea through Donbass to Russia proper.

Heavy fighting continues around Kharkiv and Sumy to the north and east. The Russians may – in the coming days – seek to bypass Kharkiv and drive a pincer movement south, through Izium towards their forces in Mariupol in order to seize a broader strip of eastern Ukraine.

However, their capacity to do so is constrained by their losses in combat and by the length of time their forces have been deployed in combat. Estimates of Russian combat losses vary wildly. The Russians have stated losses of around 1,300 troops killed in action. US and Ukrainian sources claim Russian combat deaths of between 10,000 and 17,000 respectively.

My estimate is approximately 8,000 Russian troops killed in action – the mid-range value between Russian and Ukrainian claims. If this is the case, it is a shockingly high level of military casualties for Russia. To put the figure in context, the Soviets lost 15,000 troops in nine years of combat in Afghanistan. To lose 8,000 Russian soldiers killed in one month in Ukraine represents a catastrophic attrition rate.

For every Russian soldier killed in action (KIA), there will be approximately three wounded in action (WIA). This would bring the total number of casualties to approximately 8,000 KIA, 24,000 WIA. It is not known how many Ukrainian soldiers have died in the conflict. However, the ceiling figure for Russia – at approximately 32,000 casualties, represents one third of the combat troops committed to the war in Ukraine.

Normally, in conventional combat, such losses are simply unsustainable and represent a definitive tactical defeat. With no key objectives achieved – such as the capture of major cities or regime change – the situation on the ground in Ukraine represents a tactical and strategic defeat for Vladimir Putin.

‘Liberation of Donbass’

In this context, the Head of Russian General Staff’s Operations Directorate, General Sergei Rudskoi has announced that Russian forces will concentrate on the ‘liberation of Donbass’.

In tandem with the operational pause outside Kyiv, this signals a significant recalibration and downsizing of Russian strategic objectives in Ukraine. As the diplomatic and political choreography plays out in Istanbul and on the wider global stage, the Russian military may seek to reinforce what they hold in Donbass whilst securing and consolidating their newly acquired land corridor from the Crimean Peninsula to Russia proper.

For Ukrainian civilians – of whom thousands have been slaughtered in Russia’s targeting of civilian infrastructure – the killing will continue. Russia has continued to target civilian areas in cities such as Mariupol and Kharkiv, in relentless, grid patterned artillery, air and missile strikes.

Related Read Russia says it will cut back operations near Ukrainian capital following ceasefire talks

This represents the deliberate, block-by-block, street-by-street destruction of civilians and civilian objects in order to ‘neutralise’ these targets. Those in the Kremlin who direct such operations ought to be pursued for war crimes in the aftermath of this conflict.

Russia’s immediate intentions are evident in their current re-organisation and re-grouping phase. Russia is reported to have deployed approximately 1,000 mercenaries from the ‘Wagner Group’ to the Donbass region in recent days. These hired soldiers – mostly Russian ex-military – are believed to be financed by Yevgeniy Prigozhin, an associate of Putin.

Organised along lines similar to self-styled ‘security contractors’ in the US, such as Blackwater Security, these mercenaries have been active in Ukraine since the invasion of Donbass in 2014. Their current deployment – many of them are reported to have senior command and control experience – may be designed to reassert coherence and leadership among battle weary and demoralised Russian military units in the Donbass region.

However, their presence may also be designed to further terrorise the remaining civilian population – persuading them to flee Russian-controlled areas in a form of ethnic cleansing similar to that employed during the war in the former Yugoslavia. Members of the Wagner Group have been associated with war crimes and human rights abuses in Ukraine, Libya, Syria, Central African Republic, Sudan and Mozambique.

However worrying the Wagner Group deployment may be, it is unlikely to impact on the overarching strategic military situation in Ukraine. Russia’s capacity to conduct offensive ground operations in the region is seriously compromised.

Out of a total of 100 or so Battalion Tactical Groups – available to Russian commanders at the outset of the invasion – approximately 20 have been lost or rendered ineffective. Based on western intelligence estimates, the Russians will struggle to replace 10 of these in the coming operational pause. This being the case, the Russians will continue to use air and missile strikes in their war of attrition on Ukrainian population centres – targeting civilians in the absence of a decisive conventional military victory.

The Ukrainian military will be very hard pressed to maintain their operational momentum on the ground also. After one month of sustained combat operations, re-supply and reinforcement of Ukrainian forces will be a vital factor in their continued fighting effectiveness.

To this end, Ukraine’s European partners need to keep supplies of weapons, ammunition, medical supplies and aid to the Ukrainian military at a very high tempo – not as an insurgency, but as a full-scale combat operation.

For its part, the Ukrainian military must keep its western approaches open. It must be wary of any renewed or surprise Russian offensive aimed at cutting off Kyiv. It must also avoid its forces in eastern Ukraine being cut off or surrounded by a north-south pincer movement of Russian troops attempting to connect or seize new territory between Kharkiv and Mariupol.

Whilst all of this plays out on the ground in Ukraine, the Kremlin will be carefully constructing a political narrative to pluck some face-saving victory from its tactical and strategic military defeat in Ukraine.

The peace talks represent a – perhaps brief – moment of opportunity for Ukraine and Russia to bring the current fighting to an end. Any negotiated outcomes may prove highly problematic – as an alternative to escalation to a wider European war.

Whatever the outcomes, they will be temporary. For the medium to long term, the conflict will force Europe to consider its value consensus and its collective resolve to protect those values in the future, on a broad spectrum of existential challenges.

ISTANBUL — In a dramatic about-face, a Turkish prosecutor requested Thursday to move the trial of suspects linked to the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi to Saudi Arabia, which sent the operatives who carried out the deadly assault, according to local media and a person who attended the hearing.

The prosecutor said the request to halt the Turkish trial followed a Saudi transfer request earlier in March, according to Erol Onderoglu, the Turkey representative for Reporters Without Borders who attended the hearing in a criminal court in Istanbul. The court referred the matter to Turkey’s Ministry of Justice, he said.

Facing economic woes, including a weak currency and soaring cost of living, Turkey has sought to improve relations with Saudi Arabia in recent months.

If the ministry approves, “it will have terrible consequences for the idea of justice,” Onderoglu said. All the defendants are being tried in absentia and are believed to be in Saudi Arabia.

The prosecutor’s action represents a significant turnabout by the government of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. In the days and months after the murder, Erdogan, who counted Khashoggi as a friend, played a leading role in implicating Saudi Arabia and its Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the killing.

Turkey released recordings, surveillance footage and other material that revealed a team of Saudi operatives had traveled to Istanbul and waited in the Saudi Consulate for Khashoggi, who was a contributing columnist for The Washington Post. The operatives then killed and dismembered him. His remains were never found.

Turkey’s release of evidence — and Erdogan’s outspoken disgust at the killing — spurred international outrage at Saudi Arabia for a time. Recently, as Turkey’s economy has struggled with inflation topping 50 percent, Erdogan has sought better relations with the kingdom as well as other countries in the Middle East.

The trial in Turkey was seen by some as symbolic since the defendants were absent. But the proceedings were held in public, with witness testimonies, in sharp contrast to a trial that was carried out behind closed doors in Saudi Arabia, Onderoglu said.

But in recent months, he added, it was clear that Turkey was no longer interested in pursuing the case. The court had refused to consider as evidence a U.S. intelligence report that found the Saudi crown prince had “approved” the operation that led to Khashoggi’s death.

“The recent diplomatic rapprochement between Turkey and Saudi Arabia has intensified our doubt in the search for justice in Turkey,” Onderoglu said, adding that the “international community” was also reluctant to pursue accountability.

In court Thursday, prosecutors noted the missing defendants and said attempts to pursue them through Interpol had been fruitless, Onderoglu said. Turkish officials have repeatedly denied that the judiciary is susceptible to government pressure. The next hearing is scheduled for April 7.

Saudi Arabia said in September 2020 that it had convicted eight people for the killing but did not name them. Saudi officials have denied that the crown prince ordered Khashoggi’s murder.

Hatice Cengiz, Khashoggi’s fiancee, also attended the hearing Thursday. In a message posted on Twitter afterward, she wrote about the decision facing Turkey’s Justice Ministry “showing the dilemma facing humanity in the modern era.”

“Which of the two will we choose?” she wrote. “To want to live like a virtuous human being or to build a life by holding material interests above all kinds of values. #justiceforjamal.”
