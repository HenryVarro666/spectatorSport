DERHACHI, Ukraine, April 6 (Reuters) - Dragging trolleys and clutching plastic bags with their meagre belongings, residents of the northeastern Ukrainian town of Derhachi, near the border with Russia, boarded buses on Wednesday to be evacuated as fears of a Russian assault grew.

Since pulling back from outside the capital Kyiv last week, Russian forces have shifted their assault towards Ukraine's south and east.

Ukraine's general staff said the northeastern city of Kharkiv, the country's second-largest, remained under attack on Wednesday, and authorities expect Russian forces to launch a full-blown assault soon to try to take the city.

Many in the town of Derhachi, which lies just north of Kharkiv and 30km (19 miles) from the border with Russia, have decided to leave while they can. Buildings have already been badly damaged by Russian artillery.

""The shelling has intensified in recent days. I am very worried for my children,"" said Mykola, a father of two who declined to give his surname, hugging his young son who was keeping warm under a fleece blanket.

He said he could hear the thud of bombardments every night, and had been hunkering down with his family in the corridor of their home.

""(We'll go) wherever there are no explosions, where the children won't have to hear them. I want it to be over as soon as possible,"" he said, struggling to hold back tears.

At least eight buses and vans left the town on Wednesday in an evacuation organised by the International Committee of the Red Cross towards the city of Poltava, some 150 km to the west. A family with a dog, a mother cuddling her baby, an elderly woman with a cane waited patiently for their turn to leave.

TOWN HALL DESTROYED

""It is unbearable, it is terrifying. Everything is shaking, the glass of the windows has been blown out,"" said Nina, a middle-aged woman whose daughter had already left.

She said the balcony of her house had been hit by shelling and that she had sought shelter in the bathroom and in the basement.

Another woman, Iryna, said: ""I don't want to go, I leave everything behind. But there is no other choice.""

Even the interior of the church had been pockmarked by shrapnel and the town hall was destroyed. Nearby stood a World War Two memorial plate honouring Soviet forces who liberated Derhachi from Nazi occupiers on August 12, 1943.

Mayor Viacheslav Zadorenko, who stayed behind, said he had no information about a build up of Russian troops preparing to attack.

""Our armed forces defend the town, therefore, there is no reason for panic,"" he told Reuters, adding, however, people should be taking no chances given reports of atrocities at the hands of Russian occupiers in the region around Kyiv before Ukrainian troops retook control.

""Taking into account the events in Bucha, Hostomel, we should probably evacuate as many people as possible to save their lives,"" he said.

Ukrainian authorities have accused Russian forces of killing civilians in Bucha and other nearby towns, where Reuters reporters saw bodies of people shot dead at close range, some with their hands tied behind their backs.

The Kremlin dismisses the allegations as propaganda. Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council on Tuesday that Russian troops are not targeting civilians, dismissing accusations of abuse as lies. He said that while Bucha was under Russian control ""not a single civilian suffered from any kind of violence.""

Although several animals at the Feldman Ecopark survived the incessant bombing by the Russian forces for over five weeks, the facility was devastated leading to risks of the predators venturing in the city.

He says the animals who survived can escape at any time, and must be put down, though he holds out hope some adolescent big cats may be saved and transported elsewhere.

“Feldman Ecopark doesn't exist anymore. The enclosures have been destroyed, the entire infrastructure has been destroyed,"" the zoo's owner Alexander Feldman said in a video, which was posted on Facebook.

He warned that the enclosures were badly damaged which could lead to animals, including big cats, entering the streets. Mr Feldman said it was a ""miracle"" that the tigers and lions were still alive despite their cages being destroyed.

""By tonight we will decide whether to put them all down or transport them somewhere else... Maybe we will save baby jaguars, baby panthers, but all adult animals will probably be euthanised,"" he said.

The zoo's team was working in the Chutovo region to find a way to save the animals, the owner said. ""Failing that, the only option left to us is to put the predators to sleep. It is unimaginably painful to talk about this, but the main priority now is the lives of people,"" the caption of the video read.

Three members of the staff were reportedly killed and dozens more were wounded while trying to feed the animals.

The staff were able to visit the chimpanzees and orangutans on 4 March for the first since the war began. According to reports, the monkeys had been sheltered by the Kharkov Zoo.

Earlier on Tuesday, a man rescued Ukraine's only family of tapirs and eight kangaroos from the Felman Ecopark, which was on fire because of Russian shelling.

Meanwhile, more than a month after Russia’s unprovoked invasion, the United States and its allies are preparing to impose new sanctions on Moscow over civilian killings in Bucha.

Those were the traces of two lives lost this past week, two people killed as they sat sharing a late lunch or an early dinner, or maybe just feeding pigeons. No one seemed to know their names.

They died at around 5:30 in the afternoon on Sunday in the southeastern Slobidskyi district of Kharkiv from a mortar strike, residents said, describing the victims as an older woman and a middle-aged man.

It was overcast and cold, and the ambulance came quickly.

“I was in the kitchen, putting the kettle on,” said Tetiana Stepanenko, 55, who lives in the apartment building that overlooks the park. “Suddenly the windows shuddered.”

“Then we heard the screams,” she said.
