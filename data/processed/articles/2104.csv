Russia-Ukraine War

Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a military operation in the Donbas region and asked the Ukrainian soldiers to lay down arms. In his televised address prior to the attack, Putin said that the decision of military action has been taken to demilitarize Ukraine and protect people, according to ANI. He warned other countries from interference and that any such attempts would lead to ""consequences they have never seen."" He urged Ukrainian soldiers to lay down their arms and return home. Amid Russia's military action, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday, 24 February introduced martial law and urged the citizens to remain calm. After the Russian President announced military action in Ukraine, multiple explosions were reported in places like Kharkiv, Kyiv, Odesa.

Meanwhile, the Ukrainian military captured two Russian soldiers on Thursday after Moscow launched an attack in Eastern Ukraine's Donbas region. The pictures of soldiers were released by the Ukrainian Defence Ministry on Twitter. The Ukrainian Defence Ministry tweeted, ""Soldiers of the 93rd Mechanized Brigade captured two Russian occupiers, they were from 423rd Yampol Motorized Rifle Regiment, military unit 91701."" Soon after Russia launched military operations in Donbas, Ukrainian President Zelensky announced the decision of snapping diplomatic relations with Russia. Zelensky in a tweet announced that they will lift sanctions on all citizens of Ukraine who are ready to defend their country. Furthermore, Zelensky compared Russian military action to Nazi Germany during the second world war. He asserted that Ukraine continues to defend itself and will not give up freedom. Zelensky announced that they are ready to give arms to anyone who is willing to defend their country.

According to Lukashenka, he spoke on the phone with Putin at 5 a.m. Already at 9, he was giving instructions to the military. He said ‚Äúnothing happened,‚Äù but at the same time was counting the military contingent on the Belarusian-Ukrainian borders. There are five battalion-tactical groups and special operations forces along the entire perimeter in the east of the country, which is the Homiel region. According to Lukashenka, they are preparing for provocations from Ukraine.

Lukashenka said so because he was no longer in control of the situation, says political analyst Valery Karbalevich.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that Lukashenka is not asked permission to use Belarusian territory, he is not even informed. As he said, ‚ÄúWell, I found out from the media that the Russian military might be using the Belarusian territory.‚Äù That is, the head of the country does not even control the situation,‚Äù says political analyst Valery Karbalevich.

Officially from the Ukrainian Border Guard Service: Russia attacked, including from the territory of Belarus, breaching the border.

‚ÄúWe see perfectly well what is being published: according to official reports from our general staff, attacks were repelled in the Chernihiv region. Now comes the repulsion of a helicopter attack,‚Äù says Ukrainian political analyst Andriy Rudyk.

In the first half of the day, the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valery Zaluzhny, reported shelling from Belarus.

‚ÄúFour ballistic missiles were fired from the territory of the Republic of Belarus in the southwestern direction,‚Äù Lieutenant General Valery Zaluzhny, commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, wrote on Facebook.

This is how the situation developed throughout the day. The Senkovo border outpost ‚Äì better known to Belarusians as the Three Sisters. The TOS-1A ‚ÄúSolntsepek‚Äù flamethrower system, at least four T-25V tanks, MT-LB tractors, and Ural trucks enter the territory of Ukraine from the side of Belarus.

Homiel region, the city of Mozyr, nine MI helicopters fly in the direction of the Ukrainian border.

Again, the Brahin region. A convoy of military equipment moving in the direction of ‚ÄúPripyat‚Äù.

And directly the city of Homiel. Fifty vehicles, including medical assistance. All have Russian license plates. There are Russian soldiers at the central city station.

‚ÄúIf we consider a ground operation, indeed, the Belarusian territory will be involved, and indeed then there will be a large part of the military in the Homiel region. It will be a combat zone, it will be a frontline zone,‚Äù says Valery Karbalevich.

Even though Lukashenka says that the Belarusian army was not involved in hostilities, we decided to ask our viewers: are they being called for mobilization? Five percent answered in the affirmative, more than 70% said no, and the rest had heard something about it.

Belarusians are queuing up at the exchange offices and evacuating from the border villages of the Homiel region. In Lelchitsy they are buying up gasoline at gas stations, according to our sources.

‚ÄúWe need to keep calm. It‚Äôs better, of course, to keep it when you have an emergency suitcase packed when you know where your documents are. They should be in a waterproof bag, cash should be in there, necessary medications should be in there, just in case you might be out of options at first, to get them. And my advice is to make sure that your information hygiene is in order,‚Äù gives advice Andrey Stryzhak, founder of the Bysol Solidarity Foundation.

The Bysol team has been working hard since the morning ‚Äì so many requests for evacuation. Not only from Belarus, but also from Ukraine.

‚ÄúWe try to focus only on Belarusians because there are other organizations that help Ukrainians. We do not take responsibility to save everyone, but if possible and if there is such a need, of course, we try to help those people we can help,‚Äù says Andrey Stryzhak.

It has recently emerged that Mozyr city hospital accepts the wounded of the Russian Armed Forces.
