The Children’s Hospital in Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine bombed by Russian forces, the Ukrainian State Emergency Service said on Tuesday.

“The roof of the children’s hospital in Severodonetsk caught fire after it was bombed by Russian forces. “Seven children and 15 adults were removed from the hospital.”

“My people have turned into an army, they have seen the destruction and the bloodshed shed by the enemy,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier in an online session of the Italian Parliament.

“I said a week ago that 79 children had been killed. It is now 117, and it is not the final account. Tens of thousands of families were destroyed, as were millions of homes. “My people bury their dead in parks, in mass graves,” Zelensky added.

He also stressed that Mariupol, which was completely destroyed, had a population of 500,000, like the Italian city of Genoa. “We need peace, but we only see and hear sirens, bombs and rockets,” Zelensky said.

The Ukrainian army launches counterattacks made it possible, especially in the south, to retake territories occupied by Russian military forces that are having difficulty communicating, a Pentagon spokesman said Tuesday.

The Ukrainian military “is now, in some cases, under attack,” John Kirby told CNN, noting that he was “pursuing Russian soldiers and pushing them away from areas where the Russians used to be.”

Major cities in Ukraine, however, they face Russian bombing that has killed hundreds of civilians.

The only manufacturer of tanks in Russia, the Uralvagonzavod that manufactures T-90 tanks, stopped production according to the NEXTA agency, while the same happened at its tractor factory Chelyabinsk which makes armored vehicles. The main reason for this is the lack of components after the sanctions due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The president will certainly consult on the question of China’s potential participation in the conflict of Ukraine while he’s in Brussels. He’ll do so with Nato. He’ll also do so when he addresses the 27 leaders of the European Union because on April 1, the European Union is having a summit with China. And so this will be an opportunity on Thursday for the United States and our European partners to coordinate closely on what our message is. We believe we’re very much on the same page with our European partners and we will be speaking with one voice on this issue. Sullivan was also asked about Joe Biden’s decision to visit Warsaw, especially as his vice president, Kamala Harris, has just been there. “Poland has taken the brunt of the humanitarian impact outside of Ukraine in terms of the refugee flows,” the national security adviser said. Poland is where the United States has surged a significant number of forces to be able to help defend and shore up the eastern flank. Poland has to contend not just with the war in Ukraine, but with Russia’s military deployments to Belarus, which have fundamentally changed the security equation there. And so for all of those reasons, we feel that it is the right place for him to go, to be able to see troops, to be able to see humanitarian experts and to be able to meet with a frontline and very vulnerable ally.

22 Mar 2022 14.21 A senior aide to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said China should play a more “noticeable role” in bringing the war in Ukraine to an end, Reuters reports. Andriy Yermak, who heads Zelenskiy’s office, also said he expected a dialogue “very soon” between Ukraine’s leader and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. Speaking at a virtual news conference organised by the Chatham House think-tank in London, Yermark said: So far we’ve seen China’s neutral position. And, as I said before, we believe that China ... should play a more noticeable role in bringing this war to (an) end and in building up a new global security system. We also expect China to contribute meaningfully to this new system of security for Ukraine and we also expect China to be one of the guarantors within the framework of this security system. We treat China with utmost respect and we expect it to play a pro-active role there.



22 Mar 2022 14.08 Julian Borger The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, is briefing the White House press about Joe Biden’s trip to Brussels and Warsaw on Thursday and Friday, Julian Borger reports. He said the US and allies would announce a new package of sanctions on Russia on Thursday. Sullivan did not go into details but he said: One of the key elements of that announcement will focus not just on adding new sanctions but on ensuring that there is joint effort to crack down on evasion, on sanctions-busting, on any attempt by any country to help Russia basically undermine, or weaken, or get around the sanctions. “That is an important part of this next phase,” Sullivan said. We have applied an enormous amount of economic pressure, and in order to sustain and escalate that pressure over time, part of that is about new designations, new targets, but a big part of it is about effective enforcement.

Maroš Šefčovič, the commission’s vice-president, told reporters earlier today: Nearly 3.4 million people, overwhelmingly women and children, have already arrived in the EU after fleeing Ukraine. Both the scale and speed are unprecedented, with a child arriving in the EU every second on average. The bloc must ensure the right resources are in place to meet people’s needs, he said, after initial efforts were focused on receiving people at the border.

The European Union has granted “temporary protection” to people arriving from Ukraine, including rights to residency, access to the labour market, social welfare and medical care.

22 Mar 2022 13.42 A video of the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, speaking by phone to an impostor posing as the Ukrainian prime minister was published on Monday – hours after Downing Street said it believed that Russian state actors were responsible for the hoax. In the clip, Wallace appears to be asked if he will support Ukraine’s nuclear aims; Russia has falsely claimed that Kyiv has nuclear ambitions. A defence source said: It’s a doctored clip. What you don’t hear is the defence secretary also saying that the UK can’t have anything to do with alleged Ukrainian nuclear ambitions, because the UK is committed to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The pranksters Vovan and Lexus, suspected of links to Russia’s security service, claimed responsibility for the video. 01:59 Russians release video of UK defence secretary on call with ‘Ukrainian PM’ imposter – video report

22 Mar 2022 13.15 Johana Bhuiyan The Kremlin says it would not “engage in state-level banditry”, rejecting President Biden’s warnings that US businesses could become potential targets for cyber-attacks by Russia, Johana Bhuiyan reports. Biden on Monday said that there was “evolving intelligence” that Russia was considering options to attack the US, to which Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov responded: The Russian Federation, unlike many western countries, including the United States, does not engage in state-level banditry. In the event of cyber-attacks, expert Glenn S. Gerstell told Guardian reporter Kari Paul that the private sector in the US is not well equipped to defend itself because companies have been historically “reactive and side-stepped cyber-responsibility”. “We’re prepared to respond in the sense that our military has an extraordinary offensive capability to respond on a cyber level – but we are not ready to defend as a country,” Gerstell said. The private sector is not prepared for attacks. It has relied on buggy software to protect itself, and cyber-threats are growing faster than our ability to adapt to them. We need to impose some kind of mandatory solution, because the pure market solution isn’t viable. Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said the US Department of Defense has yet to encounter any cyber-attacks but that they “wanted to make sure that leaders knew and were aware that the Russians would probably try this kind of tactic going forward”. Though there was no certainty an attack would occur, senior White House cybersecurity official Anne Neuberger said companies that provide critical infrastructure should bolster their cyber-defences.

A Russian journalist – who for years was senior foreign correspondent for state-run television – today lashed out at the propaganda broadcast by pro-Kremlin media after dramatically quitting over the invasion of Ukraine.

Zhanna Agalakova, a familiar face in Russian households from two decades work as a correspondent from postings including New York and Paris, had earlier this month announced she was leaving Pervy Kanal (Channel One) due to the invasion.

Speaking in public for the first time since she quit, Agalakova told reporters at a news conference in Paris organised by press freedom group Reporters Without Borders (RSF) that she could no longer be involved in the “lies” and “manipulation” of Russian state TV.

“I want the people of Russia to hear me and learn what propaganda is and stop being zombified,” she said.

With tears in her eyes, Agalakova said she had hesitated a lot before speaking out in public but then decided “there was no other choice”.

Agalakoa admitted that she had “made many compromises in my career” but she described the invasion of Ukraine as a “red line”.

Agalakova announced she was leaving her channel in an Instagram video posted last week, symbolically cutting a Pervy Kanal band around her wrist and saying she had already written her resignation letter on 3 March.

She described a media system that “just gives the point of view of the Kremlin”.

Agalakova pointed to how state television covers President Vladimir Putin with exhaustive coverage of his macho holiday activities but with no scrutiny of his private life which is an absolute taboo.

“Our news does not show the country, we do not see Russia,” she said.

“We only see the first man of the country, what he ate, who he shook hands with, we even saw him shirtless. But we don’t know if he’s married, if he has children,” she said.

She lambasted the state media for its repeated description of Russia’s opponents in Ukraine as “Nazis”, a term that touches a particular nerve in a country still scarred by the sacrifices of World War II.

“When, in Russia, we hear the word ‘Nazi’, we only have one reaction – destroy. It’s a manipulation, a huge lie.”

Justifying her long career as correspondent in New York and Paris, she said: “I thought that by reporting on life in Europe – and in particular in Paris – I could avoid being propagandistic.”

“I didn’t lie, every fact was real. But take real facts, mix them up and you’ll end up with a big lie,” she said.",https://www.thejournal.ie/ukraine-liveblog-tuesday-day-26-5717738-Mar2022/

During the trip to Brussels, the President will also attend a G7 summit, and the European Council and it has been suggested that he should visit the Eastern European countries bordering Ukraine in a show of solidarity.

US national security advisor Jake Sullivan held a press conference on Tuesday where he said: “The President will join our partners in imposing further sanctions on Russia and tightening the existing sanctions to crack down on evasion and ensure robust enforcement.""",https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1584268/ukraine-russia-war-live-vladimir-putin-nuclear-weapons-joe-biden-volodymyr-zelensky-latest
