""Users of Facebook & Instagram did not give the owners of these platforms the right to determine the criteria of truth and pit nations against each other,"" the embassy said on Twitter in a message that was also shared by their India office.

The temporary policy changes on calls for violence to Russian soldiers apply to Armenia, Azerbaijan, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, and Ukraine, according to one email.

In the email recently sent to moderators, Meta highlighted a change in its hate speech policy pertaining both to Russian soldiers and to Russians in the context of the invasion.

""We are issuing a spirit-of-the-policy allowance to allow T1 violent speech that would otherwise be removed under the Hate Speech policy when: (a) targeting Russian soldiers, EXCEPT prisoners of war, or (b) targeting Russians where it's clear that the context is the Russian invasion of Ukraine (e.g., content mentions the invasion, self-defense, etc.),"" it said in the email.

Last week, Russia said it was banning Facebook in the country in response to what it said were restrictions of access to Russian media on the platform.

The rule would require the state to up its zero-emission car sales in the coming years, culminating in the full ban. It comes in response to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s executive order to end the sale of gas-powered cars by 2035, which he issued last September.

Román Partida-López, legal counsel for transportation equity at the non-profit Greenlining Institute, said he expects the rule to pass in a form fairly close to where it is currently, given that CARB has already been in talks with both the advocacy community and the auto industry. “There’s probably some buy-in from both,” he told Protocol.

Car companies have historically had a bit of a tenuous relationship with California regulators, which have imposed more stringent air pollution standards than federal ones. (A number of states have adopted California's standards as well.) Since the Trump administration, though, they have mostly fallen in line. For instance, they gave up on a high-profile lawsuit over California’s ability to set its own emissions in February 2021. California is such a large market for vehicles that not only do its policies inform what kinds of cars are sold nationwide, they also tend to be echoed by federal policy.

The proposal wouldn't apply to sales of used vehicles, which is how most people in the U.S. buy their cars). It also wouldn't require cutting gas-power vehicle sales cold turkey on Jan. 1, 2035. Starting with the 2026 model year, 35% share of new cars, SUVs and small pickup trucks sold in California must be zero-emission. After that, the required share would ratchet up yearly. Of the total, 20% can be plug-in hybrids.

Partida-López said that while the rule is a step in the right direction — and could “set the standard of what electric vehicles could look like post-2026,” when the current, less ambitious clean cars rule sunsets — it does not go far enough in terms of delivering on the state’s environmental justice goals.

“Currently, the rule itself just addresses the status quo approach,” Partida-López said, in reference to the number of automakers that have already committed to selling only zero-emissions vehicles by 2035 or thereabouts. “It’s building on the commitments that automakers have already made, and not necessarily being transformative or pushing them to do better.”

The rule in its current form would likely result in one major boon for low-income communities: In expanding the number of EVs on the market, it will inevitably expand the used EV market as well, which has remained relatively thin even as the number of them on the market has swelled in recent years. But Partida-López would like to see more intentionality, saying the rule could include formal requirements that automakers work to increase accessibility and deployment of EVs in low-income communities, including access to charging networks and other avenues. There's extra urgency to do that given that those same communities often face disproportionate impacts from air pollution from gas-powered cars zipping down roads and over highways nearby.

These issues could also factor into people's livelihoods. Ride-hailing companies, for instance, have said they want to transition to EVs in the coming decades. But infrastructure as well as the cost of EVs have so far created barriers to actually getting drivers in zero-emission cars.

An alliance of automobile manufacturers expressed qualified support in the wake of the proposal, saying that they are committed to electrifying the transportation sector. They also expressed concerns, however, about whether the right pieces are in place to meet the rule’s timeline. The lack of charging infrastructure and competition for critical minerals could make the transition a little rocky. Partida-López acknowledged this is a potential challenge as well, but argued that aligning regulations with the automakers plans will incentivize the state to address these issues sooner than later.",https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/facebook-russia-violence

The changes apply to users in certain countries.

Reuters cited several internal emails sent to content moderators.

Citing several internal emails, Reuters reported Thursday that Meta Platforms – parent company to Instagram and Facebook – will allow speech on the platforms from people in specific countries that advocates for violence against invading Russians and Russian soldiers, as long as it's in a context related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""In light of the ongoing invasion of Ukraine, we made a temporary exception for those affected by war, to express violent sentiments toward invading armed forces such as ''death to the Russian invaders'. These are temporary measures designed to preserve voice and expression for people who are facing invasion. As always, we are prohibiting calls for violence against Russians outside of the narrow context of the current invasion,"" a Meta spokesperson told Insider.

The changes in terms are temporary, Reuters reported.

The platforms also will allow speech that expresses a desire for the death of Russian President Vladimir Putin, or Alexander Lukashenko, president of Belarus, from users in Russia, Ukraine, Poland, and other countries. Lukashenko has been in power since 1994, and is an ally of Putin.

Citing an email, Reuters reported that the threats or calls against the leaders would only be allowed if they do not discuss other potential victims and do not contain ""two indicators of credibility, such as the location or method.""

Facebook's ""Transparency Center"" has a section about violence and incitement, which says, ""While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by threatening or calling for violence in non-serious ways, we remove language that incites or facilitates serious violence.""

More specifically, it adds, ""Do not post.. Threats that could lead to death (and other forms of high-severity violence).""

The emails reviewed by Reuters said that expressing the desire for violence against Russian soldiers is permitted because it was operating as a symbol for the Russian military. The same principle would not count for prisoners of war.

Reuters cited a ""series"" of internal emails sent to content moderators. One email said that the rule change related to Russian soldiers would apply to users in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, and Ukraine, the outlet reported.

The outlet also quoted one of the internal emails discussing the changes:

""We are issuing a spirit-of-the-policy allowance to allow T1 violent speech that would otherwise be removed under the Hate Speech policy when: (a) targeting Russian soldiers, EXCEPT prisoners of war, or (b) targeting Russians where it's clear that the context is the Russian invasion of Ukraine (e.g., content mentions the invasion, self-defense, etc.),"" the email read.

""We are doing this because we have observed that in this specific context, 'Russian soldiers' is being used as a proxy for the Russian military. The Hate Speech policy continues to prohibit attacks on Russians,"" the email to moderators also said.

Reuters said the emails noted another content permissions change: allowing speech that positively highlights the Azov battalion, a far-right Ukrainian paramilitary group previously banned in 2019, when related to praising them for being in the country's National Guard or defending them. A Meta spokesperson has confirmed this to Reuters, but it was first reported by The Intercept.

Social media companies have responded to issues around Russia's invasion of Ukraine, such as by adding cautionary labels to Tweets from state-run media and reducing their circulation on the platform. Meta also introduced rules to help fight misinformation about the conflict.

Russia has responded, too: It blocked Facebook last week.

The reported shift in policy comes as Meta and other platforms respond to the Russian invasion into Ukraine.

Last week, Russia said it would block Facebook in the country due to the platform’s restrictions on Russian state-controlled media, which Moscow called a form of “discrimination.”

Facebook and other tech giants have cracked down on Russian state media over the spread of disinformation about the invasion after calls from global leaders, including sanctions from the European Union.

The change first surfaced in a report by Reuters, citing internal emails to moderators. In them, the outlet reports mods are told that calls for the death of Russian President Vladimir Putin or Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko will be allowed, as long as they don’t contain threats toward others or “indicators of credibility” like saying where or how the act will take place.

In a statement sent to The Verge, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said, “As a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine we have temporarily made allowances for forms of political expression that would normally violate our rules like violent speech such as ‘death to the Russian invaders.’ We still won’t allow credible calls for violence against Russian civilians.”

The New York Times confirmed this policy applies to people using the service from Ukraine, Russia, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania. The Times also notes that in 2021, Vice reported Facebook moderators received similar temporary instructions about “death to Khamanei” content and cited a spokesperson saying that Facebook had made that particular exception in certain earlier cases as well.

The Facebook community standards regarding hate speech and violence and incitement have continued to receive updates since the company started publishing them publicly in 2018. This change is just the latest example of how platforms have modified their treatment of content originating from the invading countries or relating to them since the fighting began.

An update to the Reuters report includes the content of the message sent to moderators, which reads as follows:

We are issuing a spirit-of-the-policy allowance to allow T1 violent speech that would otherwise be removed under the Hate Speech policy when: (a) targeting Russian soldiers, EXCEPT prisoners of war, or (b) targeting Russians where it’s clear that the context is the Russian invasion of Ukraine (e.g., content mentions the invasion, self-defense, etc.).

Typically, moderation guidelines would dictate that language dehumanizing or attacking a particular group based on its identity be removed. But the emails cited by Reuters claim the context of the current situation requires reading posts from the listed countries about generic Russian soldiers as a proxy for the Russian military as a whole, and absent credible statements attached, moderators are directed not to take action on them.

Still, it’s unclear whether the posts would be removed even without the direction. The policy already includes many carve-outs and exceptions. It states explicitly that additional information or context is needed before the enforcement of the policy in several cases, including:

Content attacking concepts, institutions, ideas, practices, or beliefs associated with protected characteristics, which are likely to contribute to imminent physical harm, intimidation or discrimination against the people associated with that protected characteristic. Facebook looks at a range of signs to determine whether there is a threat of harm in the content. These include but are not limited to: content that could incite imminent violence or intimidation; whether there is a period of heightened tension such as an election or ongoing conflict; and whether there is a recent history of violence against the targeted protected group. In some cases, we may also consider whether the speaker is a public figure or occupies a position of authority.

The Russian government’s reaction to the report is unknown, and there haven’t been any updates from its censorship agency Roskomnadzor, which banned Facebook earlier this month.",https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/10/22970705/russia-ukraine-moderation-facebook-instagram-hate-speech-violence-policy

Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has temporarily eased its policy on violent speech following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, saying it will allow statements such as “death to Russian invaders” but not credible threats against civilians.

The policy decision was met immediately with controversy, with Russia’s embassy in the United States demanding on Friday that Washington stop the “extremist activities” of the Facebook owner.

“Meta’s aggressive and criminal policy leading to incitement of hatred and hostility towards Russians is outrageous,” the embassy said in a statement. “The company’s actions are yet another evidence of the information war without rules declared on our country.”

The tech giant, however, defended its policy decision.

“As a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we have temporarily made allowances for forms of political expression that would normally violate our rules like violent speech such as ‘death to the Russian invaders,'” it in a statement.

“We still won’t allow credible calls for violence against Russian civilians,” it added.

Meta’s statement followed a report by Reuters news agency that said the policy applies to Armenia, Azerbaijan, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia and Ukraine, citing the firm’s emails to its content moderators.

The firm did not reply to a request seeking confirmation of the policy’s geographic boundaries.

Meta, which counts billions of users globally across its platforms, has previously struggled with what it would allow people to post in moments of upheaval.

In July 2021, the firm temporarily allowed posts calling for “death to Khamenei”, referring to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Hosseini Khamenei, during protests that rocked the country.

Tech platforms have had to navigate a slew of thorny issues related to the war in Ukraine, such as when US Senator Lindsey Graham called for the assassination of Russian President Vladimir Putin in a televised interview and on Twitter.

“The only way this ends is for somebody in Russia to take this guy out,” says Graham’s tweet from March 3, which Twitter has not taken down.

Is there a Brutus in Russia? Is there a more successful Colonel Stauffenberg in the Russian military? The only way this ends is for somebody in Russia to take this guy out. You would be doing your country – and the world – a great service. — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) March 4, 2022

Meta’s decision drew sharply contrasting views.

“The policy regards calls for violence against Russian soldiers,” said Emerson Brooking, a disinformation expert at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab.

“A call for violence here, by the way, is also a call for resistance because Ukrainians resist a violent invasion,” he added.

But some expressed deep concerns, including Lehigh University professor Jeremy Littau, who wrote on Twitter: “‘We don’t allow hate speech except against certain people from a certain country’ is one hell of a can of worms.”

“We don’t allow hate speech except against certain people from a certain country” is one hell of a can of worms. — Jeremy Littau (@JeremyLittau) March 10, 2022

Facebook and other US tech giants have moved to penalise Russia for the invasion of Ukraine. Apple and Microsoft have announced they are halting the sale of their products in Russia, while other companies have made public their “pauses” of certain business activities or ties.

Last week, US internet service provider Cogent Communications said it had “terminated its contracts with customers billing out of Russia”.

Russia, meanwhile, has also taken steps to block access to the Facebook network, joining the very small club of countries barring the largest social network in the world, along with China and North Korea.

Russian authorities have also tightened their grip on critical media, though press freedoms in the country were already rapidly waning.

Moscow blocked Facebook and restricted Twitter the same day last week that it backed the imposition of jail terms on media publishing “false information” about the military.

The war is running parallel with a period of a significant crackdown on opposition voices, which has included the arrest of protest leaders and protest participants.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/11/facebook-allows-posts-urging-violence-against-russian-invaders
