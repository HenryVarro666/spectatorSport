The surprise intervention from Russia’s Oleg Anisimov at the closed-door meeting followed an electrifying live statement from his Ukranian counterpart, Svitlana Krakovska, who spoke passionately about her country's plight.

""Let me present an apology on behalf of all Russians not able to prevent this conflict,"" Anisimov said at the closing plenary of the virtual, 195-nation forum, according to three sources who heard him speak.

Delegates and observers to the sometimes fraught meetings, which had been scheduled to end Friday, were stunned by the back-to-back statements Sunday, according to half-a-dozen participants.

Those who see what is happening, he added speaking in Russian, ""fail to find any justification for the attack on Ukraine"".

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provided simultaneous translation of his comments into English. AFP did not have access to the original statement in Russian.

Ukraine’s Krakovska, who has tried to continue working despite the assault on her country, addressed the conference on Sunday morning.

""We will not surrender in Ukraine, and we hope the world will not surrender in building a climate resilient future,"" she said in English, according to multiple sources.

""Human-induced climate change and the war on Ukraine have the same roots -- fossil fuels -- and our dependence on them,"" she added.

""Everyone 'in the room' was really moved,"" said one source, referring to online chats and informal conversations.

The statement by Anisimov -- who expressed ""huge admiration"" for the Ukranian delegation -- came as a particular surprise.

""He knows that there is a risk for him, it was a very sincere message,"" said another participant.

When asked by AFP to comment, Anisimov said that his statements ""expressed my personal opinion and attitude,"" and should not be taken as an ""official statement of the Russian delegation"".

Anisimov is a veteran of the IPCC process, first participating as a scientist and expert on the Arctic region. He contributed to earlier reports as a lead author.

The two-week IPCC meeting, overshadowed by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, was tasked with distilling a 3,500-page report on climate impacts and adaptation into a crucial 40-page ""Summary for Policymakers,"" to be made public on Monday.

Krakovska expressed her sadness that after years of meticulous work by scientists around the world, the IPCC's findings would now have to ""compete for media space with war"".

The head of the Russian delegation at a major United Nations climate meeting apologized Sunday for his country’s invasion of Ukraine, telling hundreds of government ministers and scientists that “those who know what is happening fail to find any justification for the attack.” 10 steps you can take to lower your carbon footprint ArrowRight Russia’s Oleg Anisimov’s unexpected remarks came during a virtual meeting of delegates from 195 nations who had convened to finalize a major assessment of how climate change will affect the globe in the coming decades, according to two participants who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about the closed-door negotiations.

“Let me present an apology on behalf of all Russians who were not able to prevent this conflict,” Anisimov said, according to a participant in the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s recent session.

The comments by Anisimov, a scientist at the state hydrological institute in St. Petersburg, mark a rare public rebuke of the Russian invasion by a government official. His apology came after an impassioned speech from his Ukrainian counterpart, Svitlana Krakovska, who linked the invasion of her country to the global challenge the ministers and scientists sought to confront: climate change.

“Human induced climate change and the war on Ukraine have the same roots, fossil fuels, and our dependence on them,” another delegate recalled Krakovska saying.

Anisimov studies climate change in Arctic regions, according to the Arctic Research Consortium of the United States, modeling the thawing permafrost and active layers of soil. The area of research is important because as the permafrost melts, it can release methane and accelerate warming trends. Parts of Russia’s Arctic already have warmed at a rate that is as much as triple the global average.

Industrial emissions of methane — from the U.S. Permian Basin as well as Russia’s vast and leaky pipeline network — were a key focus of the climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland. More than 110 countries have signed up for the Global Methane Pledge, vowing to reduce their emissions by 30 percent by 2030. Russia did not join the coalition even though it has the world’s highest levels of methane emissions, according to the International Energy Agency.

Anisimov, who noted that the meeting was focused on “scientific matters, not political” expressed admiration for the Ukrainian delegation’s commitment to participating in the negotiations despite the war in their home country, the first participant recalled.

The report that will be released on Monday discusses the millions of people who will be displaced by climate disasters and conflict linked to food and water shortages, the Ukrainian delegate said. Perhaps in the future, she said, the hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians currently fleeing their country will also be seen as climate migrants.

Krakovska woke up in a different world on Thursday, she told fellow negotiators on Sunday. The Ukrainian delegation was briefly absent from the virtual meeting, one witness recalled, but returned to participate in the final sessions.

She declared that she and her colleagues would keep working on the report as long as they had Internet and no bombs were falling on their heads.

“We will not surrender in Ukraine,” she told other delegates. “And we hope the world will not surrender in building a climate-resilient future.”

Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.

As the day began, Russia’s currency lost as much as a quarter of its value within hours. Scrambling to stem the decline, the Russian Central Bank more than doubled its key interest rate, banned foreigners from selling Russian securities and ordered exporters to convert into rubles most of their foreign-currency revenues. It closed the Moscow stock exchange for the day because of the “developing situation.”

“The economic reality has, of course, changed,” the Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told reporters, announcing that Mr. Putin had called an emergency meeting with his top finance officials.

Even as Russian and Ukrainian delegations met for talks at the Belarus border, Moscow’s military offensive showed no sign of letting up, and the hectic moves offered the first signs that the sanctions imposed on Russia by the West over the weekend were shaking the foundations of Russia’s economy. The decisions by the United States, Britain and the European Union restricting the Russian Central Bank’s access to much of its $643 billion in foreign currency reserves have undone much of the Kremlin’s careful efforts to soften the impact of potential sanctions.

And with dozens of countries closing their airspace to Russian planes, major foreign investors pulling out and the West placing debilitating restrictions on Russia’s biggest banks, it was becoming clear that Mr. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine was ushering in a period of international isolation for Russia unseen since the Cold War.

“So, has Russia become Venezuela or is it still Iran?” the morning-show host on the liberal-leaning Echo of Moscow radio station asked an economist on Monday.

“We’ll go through the Iran phase,” Yevgeny S. Gontmakher of Moscow’s Higher School of Economics responded, referring to sanctions placed on Iran because of its plans for uranium enrichment, “but what happens after that is hard to say.”

Elvira Nabiullina, the widely respected governor of the Russian Central Bank, was expected to speak to the public at 4 p.m. Moscow time.

On Sunday, Mr. Putin called the West’s sanctions “illegitimate” in a televised meeting with his defense minister and top military commander. Mr. Putin then told them to place Russia’s nuclear arsenal on high alert; some analysts fear that Russia’s economic instability could lead Mr. Putin to escalate his conflict with the West using new military threats or other means, such as cyberattacks.

But there was also extreme uncertainty inside Russia as the value of people’s savings evaporated and the interconnections with the Western world that Russians had come to take for granted in the last three decades rapidly broke away. It was not immediately clear whether most Russians would blame Mr. Putin for the crisis — or whether they would take cues from Kremlin propaganda and blame the West.

“Times change, much has happened, but one thing has not changed,” a reporter on the state-run news channel Rossiya 24 said on Sunday. “When a united Europe tried to destroy Russia, this always ended up bringing about the opposite result.”

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine violates Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, a central tenet of the charter that requires UN member states to refrain from the “use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.”

The suggestion by President Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials that Russia’s use of force is justified under Article 51 of the UN Charter has no support in fact or law. Article 51 provides that “nothing in the present charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a member of the United Nations.” However, Ukraine did not commit or threaten to commit an armed attack against Russia or any other UN member state. Even if Russia could show that Ukraine had committed or planned to commit attacks on Russians in the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, Article 51 would not permit an action in collective self-defense, because Donetsk and Luhansk are not UN member states. Indeed, they do not even qualify as states under international law, despite their purported secession from Ukraine and Russia’s recognition of them as independent.

Putin’s statements that Ukraine was committing “genocide” against Russians in Donetsk and Luhansk, although a thinly veiled effort to justify Russia’s use of force in the language of international law, are also not supported by the facts and would not, in any case, give Russia a right to launch an invasion of Ukraine. The Genocide Convention defines genocide as certain, specified actions intended to destroy in whole or in part a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group. There is no evidence that Ukraine engaged in any of the defined actions and certainly no evidence of an intent to destroy in whole or in part any group in eastern Ukraine. Even if the Ukrainian government had committed human rights abuses against Russians in eastern Ukraine, neither the Genocide Convention nor the UN Charter authorizes convention parties or UN member states to use force to remedy acts of genocide or serious human rights abuses.

Russia’s recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states last week was inconsistent with international law governing state sovereignty and secession. In general, international law requires respect for the territorial integrity of states and does not permit regions of states to declare independence and secede. Some international law experts believe that so-called remedial secession is permissible as a last resort when a people have suffered grave human rights abuses at the hands of the state government and have been unable to exercise internal self-determination , but this is a minority view and few (if any) lawyers are likely to argue that secession by Donetsk and Luhansk was justified in this case.

Russia’s Playbook

Russia’s actions appear to be a replay of its moves in Crimea in 2014, when it annexed Crimea after the region declared itself independent from Ukraine in a referendum. The United States and most European countries do not accept Russia’s annexation of Crimea and consider Russia to be unlawfully occupying part of Ukraine. Russia has not yet annexed Donetsk and Luhansk but could do so in the future. Even if Russia does not annex the regions, very few other UN members are likely to recognize them as independent states. If Russia does annex them, the United States and most European countries will likely consider the regions to be unlawfully occupied by Russia.



Russia previously recognized two regions of Georgia as independent states—South Ossetia and Abkhazia—after they declared their independence in 2008. Only four other UN member states—Nauru, Nicaragua, Syria, and Venezuela—recognize the regions as independent. In contrast, Russia rejected Kosovo’s 2008 declaration of independence from Serbia, claiming that Kosovars were not a distinct people and did not qualify for remedial secession. Ninety-seven UN member states have since recognized Kosovo as an independent state. The United States and many European countries support Kosovo’s independence but argue that its situation is unique and that it did not set a precedent for any other territorial secessions.

International Institutions Respond to Russia’s Actions

In addition to financial sanctions imposed bilaterally by the United States and numerous other countries, Russia is likely to face widespread condemnation and isolation in international bodies. Very few governments and law experts will believe that Russia’s actions are permissible under international law. On Friday, the Council of Europe suspended Russia’s participation in its Committee of Ministers and its Parliamentary Assembly. Meanwhile, the UN Security Council voted on a binding resolution condemning the invasion and requiring Russia to cease its military actions and withdraw from Ukraine. But Russia, as a permanent member of the Security Council, vetoed the resolution.

On Sunday, the Security Council voted 11-1 (with Russia opposed and three members abstaining) on a nonbinding resolution calling on the UN General Assembly to hold an emergency special session to consider Russia’s actions. This Security Council resolution comports with UN General Assembly Resolution 377(V) of 1950 (the so-called Uniting for Peace resolution), which resolved that in the case of a deadlock in the Security Council, the General Assembly shall “consider the matter immediately with a view to making recommendations to members for collective measures.” The General Assembly is likely to overwhelmingly adopt a resolution opposing Russia’s actions as a threat to Ukraine’s territorial integrity, sovereignty, and political independence, as it did in 2014 after Russia annexed Crimea. The General Assembly could also mandate a UN investigation of Russia’s actions, urge member states to impose sanctions on Russia, or recommend that Russia be expelled or suspended from certain UN bodies.

In addition, Ukraine also filed another claim against Russia in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Sunday, alleging that Russia misinterpreted the Genocide Convention to justify the invasion of Ukraine. The ICJ is already hearing two claims Ukraine filed in 2017 relating to Russia’s actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. Putin and other Russian officials could face an investigation by the ICJ for war crimes committed during the invasion. Although Russia is not a party to the Rome Statute, which established the International Criminal Court (ICC), Ukraine has accepted the ICC’s jurisdiction for offenses that have occurred on its territory since 2013 (other than the crime of aggression, for which the ICC does not have jurisdiction for nonparties).",https://www.cfr.org/article/how-russias-invasion-ukraine-violates-international-law
