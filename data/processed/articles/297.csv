0,77a205fe-ef17-4063-a03d-715dce156c3b,['Veronica Stracqualursi'],2022-03-09,"Washington (CNN) The Pentagon said Wednesday that it is bluntly opposed to a Polish plan to provide fighter jets to Ukraine.

US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin told the Polish minister of defense that the US does not support the transfer of MiG-29 fighter jets to the Ukrainian air force ""at this time,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said, either by Poland transferring them to Ukraine with the US backfilling Poland's fleet or by Poland transferring the MiG-29s to the US to then give to Ukraine.

Austin ""stressed that we do not support the transfer of additional fighter aircraft to the Ukrainian air force at this time, and therefore have no desire to see them in our custody either,"" Kirby said.

His comments come a day after the US rejected a proposal from Poland to send Soviet-era fighter jets to Ukraine by way of a US-NATO air base in Germany.

The US and NATO want to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian troops invading the country, but also avoid being drawn into an outright conflict with Russia.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been asking the West for MiG-29 fighter jets, which were used during the Cold War and that Ukrainian pilots were trained to use, to maintain control of the skies in his country as it remains under attack by Russia.

Zelensky's other request for help establishing a no-fly zone over Ukraine has been rejected by the US and the alliance, who view it as a move that would pit them directly against Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin has also warned that he would consider countries imposing a no-fly zone ""as participants in a military conflict.""

With a no-fly zone off the table, the US has weighed the option of providing support to the Ukrainian military by helping facilitate the delivery of Polish fighter jets to Ukraine. But it has proven to be a thorny political issue and logistically complicated objective.

Over the weekend, the US said it was in discussions with Poland about a potential deal in which Poland would supply Ukraine with MiG-29 fighter jets that Ukraine has requested, and the US would then provide Poland with American F-16s.

Poland, however, on Tuesday took the US by surprise and offered to deploy all its MiG-29 fighter jets to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia -- but by first sending the jets to US Ramstein Air Base in Germany, also a NATO nation.

The US Defense Department rejected the proposal as not ""tenable"" and deemed it too risky.

""The prospect of fighter jets 'at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America' departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,"" Kirby had said in a statement Tuesday.

US officials described the issue to CNN as twofold: a logistics problem of getting the jets to Ukraine, and a political problem of avoiding escalation with Russia. US officials described the Polish plan as failing to adequately address both.

NATO members have expressed concerns that providing fighter jets to Ukraine -- even if done bilaterally -- could be perceived by Russia as the alliance becoming directly involved in the war, NATO diplomats told CNN.

Poland, a NATO member and neighbor of Ukraine, has also been worried about the risks of sharing the fighter jets with Ukraine, as they don't want to become a party to the conflict and escalate the situation along their border, Polish officials told CNN.

Polish Ambassador to the US Marek Magierowski said Wednesday evening that Poland was ""acutely aware"" of the consequences involved with its proposal.

""We were under immense pressure on the part of our allies, and public opinion also here in the United States. And we were acutely aware of all technical, legal and diplomatic consequences of such a move, which was risky, of course,"" Magierowski told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room.""

""That is why we came up with a logical, conscionable solution. Our American partners rejected this proposal, because they have come to the conclusion that it was too escalatory. Well, we understand this, and I believe that we can continue coordinating our joint efforts with our American partners and with other NATO members in order to help the Ukrainians defend themselves as effectively as possible.""

If a Russian attack extends into one of the bordering NATO countries, it could trigger Article 5 of NATO's founding treaty, which is the principle that an attack on one member of the alliance is an attack on all members.

If Article 5 is invoked, the US and other NATO members would then be obligated to provide resources to protect a fellow NATO member and could find themselves directly involved in the Ukraine-Russia conflict.

Discussions continuing

Prior to Kirby stating the Pentagon is strongly opposed to Poland's proposal on Wednesday afternoon, senior administration officials told CNN the US is continuing to consult with Poland and other NATO allies about the possibility of providing fighter jets to Ukraine.

American and Polish officials have held a ""number of conversations"" since the White House was caught off guard by Warsaw's statement, a US administration official told CNN, adding that the relationship between the two countries remains strong despite the disagreement.

US Vice President Kamala Harris is also traveling to Poland this week and is expected to discuss the issue.

US officials also told CNN that they do not believe the episode precludes reaching some type of agreement that would allow the jets to get to Ukraine.

As of now, though, there are no immediate apparent solutions for the US to facilitate the delivery of jets to Ukraine since rejecting Poland's offer.

""I think what we're seeing is that Poland's proposal shows that there are some complexities that the issue presents when it comes to providing security systems. We have to make sure that we're doing it the right way,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters Wednesday at the State Department headquarters.

Logistical challenges

The US has made clear that sending jets to Ukraine is a ""sovereign decision"" for Poland to make, but has been willing to help sort through the challenges.

Besides the political quagmire, there are logistical challenges with sending fighter jets to Ukraine for the US and NATO allies to still work out.

""Secretary Austin, Chairman Milley and members of our Defense Department are in touch with Ukrainian counterparts, NATO counterparts, discussing what are clearly logistical challenges here,"" White House press secretary Psaki said on Wednesday.

Psaki cited some of the logistical and operational challenges: getting planes into Ukraine in a way that is not escalatory, potentially having to take the planes apart and putting them back together, and ensuring the planes' safe movement amid a war.

She later called it a ""serious logistical bottleneck,"" saying that discussions on the matter are ongoing.

Open-ended questions include how the aircraft would actually be moved from Poland to Ukraine and the number of Ukrainian pilots available, US Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Monday.

One idea floated initially was that Ukrainians would travel to Poland to retrieve the fighter jets and fly them back into Ukraine's dangerous air space, which US officials say remains contested.

Ukraine late last month made a request for MiG-29s to Poland, Slovakia and Bulgaria, and Zelensky on Saturday in a call with US lawmakers pleaded for US help in getting the fighter aircraft to his country.

Some of the countries appeared to have a willingness to consider this move before Poland offered to send their MiG-19s. As of Wednesday, US officials are not ruling out talks with those three other European nations as they seek a way to get the fighter jets to Ukraine.

Ukrainian cities are under siege, and Ukraine is pleading with the West to send it fighter jets. But as a recent tiff between the U.S. and Poland over providing jets to Ukraine underscores, there are limits to what the United States and NATO are willing to do to help, as world leaders scramble to ensure that the war does not spill beyond Ukraine’s borders or escalate into a direct confrontation between powers armed with nuclear weapons.

Here’s what happened between the United States and Poland, and what it says about the war in Ukraine.

Why does Ukraine want fighter jets?

Ukraine has pilots ready to fly and fight Russians, but it can’t compete with Russia’s air power. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told U.S. lawmakers that fighter jets are his country’s top priority, even over antiaircraft missiles that Ukraine has been getting from its allies.

“If you can’t do [a no-fly zone], at least get me planes,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told members of Congress in a call this weekend, Republican senators said.

No one has given Ukraine fighter jets since Russia’s invasion, said Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.

What did Poland offer?

In an unusual move, Poland on Tuesday offered to send a number of Russian-made MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine via an American air base in Germany, blindsiding U.S. officials, who said they had not been consulted, The Washington Post reported. In exchange, Poland requested that the United States send it replacement planes, presumably newer, U.S.-manufactured F-16s, which would constitute a major upgrade.

The United States and Poland had been in preliminary talks about some kind of plane swap to help Ukraine get more fighter jets. But Poland proposed Tuesday that the United States step in to move the planes to Ukraine, which was not part of Washington’s plan.

Poland is “ready to deploy — immediately and free of charge — all their MiG-29 jets to the Ramstein Air Base and place them at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America,” which would in turn “provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities,” read a statement posted to the website of the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The offer would be a win-win for Poland: It would help Ukraine in its fight with Russia, which Poland also sees as a threat, and bolster the Polish air force.

And it wouldn’t have to take direct responsibility for getting the planes to Ukraine.

Poland is worried both about the war next door in Ukraine and about Putin finding a pretext to invade other parts of Eastern Europe. The United States is also worried about the war spreading to Ukraine’s neighbors, some of whom are also NATO members. The United States announced Tuesday that it would send to Poland two Patriot missile batteries, a defensive measure that can detect and fire rockets at incoming missiles. Poland has been requesting new F-16s from Washington for a while. But production for the warplanes is backlogged and the United States has promised Taiwan, under increasing threat from China and spooked by Russia’s attempt to annex Ukraine, that it would receive the next batch. Poland presumably asked for “used” planes to bypass this issue.

Why MiG-29 jets?

Because that’s what Ukrainians are trained to fly.

The MiG-29 was the Soviet Union’s prized fighter jet. The warplane was designed in the late 1970s in part to counter the fast and versatile U.S.-manufactured F-16s. When U.S. intelligence first learned the Soviets were making fighter jets, they were worried to see the Soviet Union catching up with U.S. aircraft technologies, Smithsonian magazine reported.

Countries across the then-former Soviet Union flew the warplanes, as have others such as Iraq, Cuba, Iran and North Korea.

Over time, Washington also learned more about the jets and developed its own technologies to better counter them. The planes have by now largely fallen out of use, but they remain predominant in former Soviet states.

Why the U.S. basically rejected this plan

It would shift the responsibility for delivering the fighter jets — and the risk of confrontation with Russia — on to Washington in a very public way.

“We do not believe Poland’s proposal is a tenable one,” John Kirby, press secretary for the Pentagon, said in a statement.

Poland’s offer would require the United States and NATO to play a lead role in getting the planes to Ukraine. Even in the context of broad Western effort to arm Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin could easily construe jets taking off from a NATO base in Germany to eventually fight Russians as NATO fighting Russians. That, Kirby said, “raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance.”

Left unsaid is that if Washington does find a way to get fighter jets into Ukraine, it wants to do it as quietly as possible. “They are trying to find a low-visibility way to send planes to Ukraine,” Cancian said, “as opposed to holding a news conference to announce they’re trying to do it.”

The United States and Europe were totally caught off guard by Poland’s offer, given Poland had just rejected a U.S. offer to send planes from Poland. “Sideswiped” is how one European official described the reaction,, The Post reported.

On a visit to Poland days after this, Vice President Harris tried to smooth over the diplomatic relationship between the two countries: “I want to be very clear,” Harris told reporters. “The United States and Poland are united in what we have done, and are prepared to do, to help Ukraine and the people of Ukraine, full stop.”

What does NATO fear?

Western officials and their allies are very worried about how this war could quickly escalate — into NATO countries, into Western Europe and even into a nuclear war.

Putin is feeding those fears. He’s talked about his country’s nuclear weapons and warned that he would view any nation that declared a no-fly zone — a threat to shoot down Russian planes over Ukraine — “as participants of the military conflict.”

Plus, the line between proxy war between the United States and Russia and real war is getting fuzzier. The United States has been supplying Ukraine weapons for years — billions of dollars worth, my colleagues report — and they’ve ramped that up as the Russian invasion loomed. They’ve sent them missiles, antitank weapons, ammunition and systems that let Ukrainians shoot down Russian aircraft.

But some U.S. officials have fretted that the United States’ definition of direct combat with Russia is not Putin’s, the New York Times reports. “Some U.S. national security officials say they have a foreboding that [direct] conflict is increasingly likely,” the Times writes.

Could the U.S. still send planes to Ukraine?

Possibly. In fact, Cancian thinks it’s likely that Washington could find a way to transfer these Soviet-era planes to Ukraine when no one’s looking. “They’ll find a secret airfield somewhere,” he said

Republican members of Congress are putting pressure on the Biden administration to get these jets. Republican senators held a news conference Thursday saying they think Putin already knows American weapons are killing Russians, and demanding that the Biden administration get Ukraine jets. “I have talked to numerous colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and they too agree with the need to get these jets to Ukrainians,” asserted Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) on Thursday.

For now, though, the United States and NATO publicly launching planes into Ukraine could be a step too far for officials.

The United States, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday, is trying to “end this war in Ukraine, not start a larger one.”

Though they haven’t ruled out getting the jets to Ukraine, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the military is studying options that would avoid raising Russia’s ire to a tipping point: “How do you get planes into Ukraine in a way that is not escalatory, and what are the logistics and operational details of that?” she asked. “Carting them down the street is not as easy as you may think it is.”

Cancian says it’s a matter of time before planes make it to Ukraine, with the help of the United States.

Poland can send its warplanes to Ukraine without the Biden administration’s approval. No, really, it can — right now, actually. But the issue is Warsaw doesn’t want to, not that President JOE BIDEN unilaterally blocked the handover to Kyiv.

This straightforward point — that Poland is in charge of its MiG-29s, not America — has gotten lost in the brouhaha over the botched U.S.-Poland deal.

After a broader secret arrangement was errantly made public by the European Union’s top diplomat, Washington worked for weeks with Warsaw to salvage the warplane transfer to Ukraine. Ultimately it fell through because Poland wanted the U.S. to act as the middleman instead of directly giving the keys to Ukrainian pilots. The reason? Fear, from all sides.

“They are worried about Russia responding with military strikes against Polish bases, including nuclear strikes,” someone familiar with the Polish government’s thinking told NatSec Daily. In effect, Poland passed the buck to the U.S., hoping America would take the heat while guaranteeing F-16s as a backfill.

Biden and his team didn’t think that was a good idea. Not only did the U.S. fear an open handover of warplanes would ratchet up tensions, but officials in the Pentagon and intelligence community made clear the costs would outweigh the benefits. The president agreed with them, leading the administration to express its opposition to the deal, even though they repeatedly said Poland maintains the sovereign right to give Ukraine its fighter jets.

“The transfer of MiG-29 aircraft will not appreciably increase the effectiveness of the Ukrainian Air Force. The Ukrainian Air Force currently possesses numerous mission capable aircraft that are flying daily. Adding aircraft to the Ukrainian inventory is unlikely to change the effectiveness of the Ukrainian Air Force relative to Russian capabilities. Therefore, we assess that the overall gain is low,” Gen. TOD WOLTERS, the U.S. European Command chief, said in a Thursday statement.

A senior U.S. defense official added Friday that the Ukrainians “are not using their fixed-wing fighter aircraft very much. They have about 56 fighter aircraft remaining on the ground, and that is the majority of their fleet.” Kyiv is only flying about five to 10 sorties a day compared to Russia’s roughly 200, the official continued. The Ukrainians “haven't proven that they need to do more than what they're doing. They've been very effective with the other tools that they have used, very creatively, and those are having a good effect on Russian airpower.”

(NatSec Daily can’t help but note that Ukrainians figured out how to drop Molotov cocktails from drones.)

Instead of fighter jets, the U.S. and its allies may soon provide what they deem are more effective weapons to counter Russian President VLADIMIR PUTIN’s forces.

“The surface-to-air systems under consideration are more sophisticated than the shoulder-launched, heat-seeking missiles NATO members and others have already provided Ukraine. They include what NATO refers to as the SA-8 and SA-10, which can target planes at much higher altitudes, as well as what Russia calls the S-300, which was a state-of-the-art system until a few years ago,” The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. “The S-300 is an air-defense system, first produced by the Soviet Union and later Russia, that is capable of shooting down aircraft and cruise missiles. The S-300 was designed to be highly mobile, allowing air-defense forces to fire their weapons and quickly relocate to avoid being hit in a retaliatory strike.”

It’s still unclear where the S-300s would come from, but three NATO countries — Bulgaria, Greece and Slovakia — have them.

And yet, all the administration’s critics can talk about is the lack of MiGs, which, again, is Poland’s decision, not America’s.

“[W]e strongly disagree with your decision to delay and deny Poland the option to transfer fighter jets to Ukraine,” 42 Republican senators, led by Sen. JONI ERNST (R-Iowa) and including Senate Minority Leader MITCH McCONNELL, wrote to Biden in a Thursday letter.

“At this point, why are we picking and choosing what we think would constitute a bridge too far with Putin? He has said in the past he thinks sanctions are an act of war. We’ve been sending in military equipment already that is being used against Russian soldiers and likely killing Russian soldiers. We don’t understand why the administration thinks these planes will somehow become the straw that broke the camel’s back,” said a senior House GOP aide.

Democrats are pushing back. “Bottom line is Congress and the admin have poured an unprecedented amount of defensive and lethal aid to Ukraine to meet their most urgent needs. If Ukraine needs planes, we’ll find a way,” a senior Democratic staffer texted NatSec Daily. “But right now, it’s clear that’s not at the top of the list of what they need. But yet again, Republicans seem to be looking for ways to use Ukraine to score political points at home.”

U.S. ENDS NORMAL TRADE TIES WITH RUSSIA: Biden announced that he wants to work with Congress to impose Cold War-era trade restrictions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, our own DOUG PALMER reported.

Removing “permanent normal trade relations,” or PNTR, with Russia “is going to make it harder for Russia to do business with the United States and doing it in unison with other nations that make up half of the global economy will be another crushing blow to the Russian economy. It’s already suffering very badly from our sanctions,” Biden said at a White House event to announce coordinated action with Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom as well as the European Union.

Biden also announced he was banning imports of Russian seafood, vodka and diamonds, which White House officials said collectively totaled more than $1 billion.

The Commerce Department also moved Friday to cut off Russia’s access to luxury goods, imposing restrictions on the export and reexport of American-made booze, jewelry, vehicles and clothing to all consumers in both Russia and neighboring Belarus.

Congress could vote on repealing PNTR as early as next week. “Vladimir Putin doesn’t get to tear down the international order, brutalize the Ukrainian people with his unjust war and then benefit from normal trade relations,” Senate Finance Chair RON WYDEN (D-Ore.) said.

RUSSIAN DRONES ARRIVE: Two weeks into the war, and Russian drones are finally starting to show up on the battlefield. Social media posts by Ukraine watchers have identified Russian Orlan and Forpost surveillance drones on the ground, suggesting that the lack of evidence of Russian unmanned operations doesn’t mean their absence.

The fact that small Russian units have been so regularly ambushed in the early days of the war indicates they weren’t using small drones for surveillance and reconnaissance, in effect ignoring their own doctrine and training, said SAMUEL BENDETT, an adviser with CNA’s Russia Studies Program and adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security.

“They were supposed to have [intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance] ISR assets overhead,” Bendett said. While the Russian ground forces are still making “strange mistakes and errors, we are starting to see evidence of Russian UAVs as ISR assets” helping them out over the past several days.

The Russian defense ministry — possibly trying to match the epic videos of Ukrainian Bayraktar drones wiping out Russian armor — has released two videos of their Orion mid-range combat drone firing missiles at Ukrainian targets. “They're doing sort of a piecemeal PR by showing that an Orion drone is capable of striking targets,” Bendett said. But it’s still not clear how many drones Russia is flying, or why they don’t seem to be feeding useful intel back to the forces on the ground who continue to be surprised, and attacked, by the Ukrainians.

UKRAINE ON THE BRAIN: Instead of our normal Friday “Drinks with NatSec Daily” feature, for the next few weeks we’ll ask members of our community to send us their favorite things about Ukraine.

Today, we’re featuring the memories of Puck News’ JULIA IOFFE, who has been a must-read source on all things Ukraine these past few weeks. Here’s what she sent in:

“My favorite fact about Ukraine is that it gave us both the Beylis trial and [Ukrainian President] VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY. It is a country that had fought and worked to break away from its past, from its Soviet past, its nationalist, anti-Semitic past. It wasn't always perfect, but it was doing it, forging its way into a better, more tolerant, more democratic future. It is awful to see it being punished for exactly that, for having a future that is unlike its past,” she wrote.

“Favorite memory is sitting with my grandmother one evening on the patio of a traditional Odessa courtyard where we were staying with her cousin Volodya and his Greek-Ukrainian wife Galya. My grandmother's father and Volodya's father were brothers, born in Odessa to a poor, alcoholic Jewish cobbler. There were something like 11 siblings and they all scattered across the Soviet Union. Now we were sitting under the stars in their fathers' home city, drinking beer, and telling old Odessa jokes because Odessa is the wellspring of Jewish humor,” she continued.

Please send us your favorite memories of Ukraine and we’ll try to feature them in an upcoming Friday edition of NatSec Daily.

Flashpoints

EU DOESN’T FAST TRACK UKRAINE MEMBERSHIP: The European Union firmly sided with Ukraine during a summit in Versailles Friday, but stopped short of promising to admit the country into the bloc any time soon.

“The European Council acknowledged the European aspirations and the European choice of Ukraine,” the EU said in a statement, adding that it’s moving “swiftly” to get the European Commission’s “opinion” on the matter. As our own DAVID HERSZENHORN and JACOPO BARIGAZZI reported, all this means is Ukraine is at the “the initial stage of a long process toward being declared a candidate country and beginning membership talks.”

“While the statement was unequivocal in voicing the EU’s intention to help Ukraine, including with political and financial assistance and temporary protection for refugees, it did not offer the guarantee of membership that Zelenskyy had requested,” they continued. “A number of EU countries, led by the Netherlands, had insisted that there was no way to shortcut the lengthy accession process, even for Ukraine, which is under active military attack by Russia.”

Still, the EU will contribute around $550 million in assistance to Ukraine and further pledged to rebuild the country after the war — “presuming the country still exists and has not been occupied by” Russian forces, Herszenhorn and Barigazzi wrote.

DID DRONE FROM UKRAINE WAR LAND IN CROATIA? The War Zone’s TYLER ROGOWAY has a wild story about a drone from the Ukraine-Russia war possibly crash landing in Croatia — a NATO country.

“After close examination of the visual evidence, The War Zone strongly believes this was actually a Tu-141 ‘Strizh’ reconnaissance drone that must have severely malfunctioned and crossed over the entirety of Hungary or parts of neighboring countries and into Croatia from Ukraine. Flying direct from Ukraine's border to Zagreb is nearly a 350-mile journey. It has been reported that Ukraine has been putting the high-speed, Soviet-era drones to work in recent days following Russia's invasion of the country. Ukraine is the only known current operator of the Tu-141,” Rogoway wrote.

Croatian President ZORAN MILANOVIĆ said the drone crash was a “serious incident” but “was not directed at Croatia.”

“The drone flew over Hungary for over 40 minutes, it was less than seven minutes in the Croatian air space, and crashed in the Jarun neighbourhood, fortunately with no casualties,” he said in a Friday statement. “[C]ertain procedural things must be examined, we must ascertain how it has come to this, and how come a drone the size of an airplane was not struck down on its path from evidently Ukraine to Zagreb.”



Keystrokes

YOUTUBE BLOCKS RUSSIAN STATE MEDIA WORLDWIDE: YouTube announced on Friday that it’s banning Russian-state funded media channels on its video platform globally, setting up potential pushback and blockage by Moscow.

Google's video platform announcement has larger implications for how Russia spreads its state-run propaganda through its RT (formerly Russia Today) and Sputnik channels on YouTube, which will no longer be accessible in Russia or the rest of the world. This is an expansion from YouTube's ban of these channels in Europe on March 1, due to the spread of disinformation justifying Russia's invasion into Ukraine.

YouTube's actions — the furthest the platform has taken since Russia's invasion in Ukraine — puts the company square in the target of Russia's communications regulator, Roskomnadzor. The regulator has blocked Facebook and restricted access to Instagram due to their parent company's efforts to clamp down on Russian disinformation and the prevalence of Ukrainians calling for violence against Russian soldiers, our own REBECCA KERN wrote (for Pros!).



WH BRIEFED TIKTOKERS ON UKRAINE: I guess we can now add TikTok stars as extended members of the White House press corps.

Per The Washington Post’s TAYLOR LORENZ, White House press secretary JEN PSAKI and her team briefed 30 influential TikTokers about the administration’s Ukraine policy and strategic goals. The aim — other than promoting viral dances or one-person bits — is to better inform those with large followings so they can spread that message to the larger public.

“This week, the administration began working with Gen Z For Change, a nonprofit advocacy group, to help identify top content creators on the platform to orchestrate a briefing aimed at answering questions about the conflict and the United States’ role in it. VICTORIA HAMMETT, deputy executive director of Gen Z For Change, contacted dozens with invitations via email and gathered potential questions for the Biden administration,” Lorenz wrote.

“The invitations to the event were distributed Tuesday and Wednesday. KAHLIL GREENE, 21, a creator with more than 534,000 followers on TikTok, said he wasn’t surprised when an invitation arrived in his email inbox. ‘People in my generation get all our information from TikTok,’ he said. ‘It’s the first place we’re searching up new topics and learning about things.’ So, he figured, it made sense that the Biden administration would engage people like him on the platform,” Greene told Lorenz.

You can listen to the 50-minute recording of the call, led by special adviser for communications MATT MILLER.



The Complex

HERMEUS PAYDAY: Our friends at Morning Defense (for Pros!) reported that hypersonic aircraft company Hermeus raised $100 million — bringing its total to $176 million to make a new (very) fast plane.

Backers include In-Q-Tel, a nonprofit tech investor for U.S. intelligence agencies, and Founders Fund, the VC outfit that has invested in other start-ups such as Anduril, Palantir and SpaceX.

The Air Force has invested up to $30 million in the Atlanta-based company to expand the hypersonic propulsion industrial base. Hermeus was the only start-up present at the Pentagon’s unclassified meeting in February on hypersonic weapons development.

The new funding will be used to complete the development of the hypersonic aircraft Quarterhorse — which is slated to make its first flight next year — and accelerate the uncrewed Darkhorse. Both projects are expected to assist in development of Halcyon, a hypersonic commercial passenger aircraft.



On the Hill

$1.5B McCONNELL-SCHUMER CALL: McConnell and Senate Majority Leader CHUCK SCHUMER’s call this week led to the doubling of a $1.5 billion fund to assist Ukraine’s troops.

“While Ukraine came under attack, Congress scrambled to boost lethal and humanitarian aid for the European ally. So as leaders finalized a $1.5 trillion government spending bill that included emergency assistance for Ukraine, the Senate GOP leader phoned his Democratic counterpart this week with a simple but significant request: Double the size of a critical $1.5 billion fund for Ukraine to help its military fight Russian invaders,” our own BURGESS EVERETT and ANDREW DESIDERIO wrote.

“To Chuck’s credit, he said, ‘OK,’” McConnell recalled in an interview Thursday in his Capitol office. “It wasn’t a hard sell.”

All told, the bill Biden will soon sign will more than double his initial request of $6.4 billion for Ukraine to roughly $14 billion. Senators in both parties negotiating the aid deal described a pot of money that ballooned each day as Russia’s assault on Ukraine escalated, killing civilians and sending millions of refugees across Europe.

“I do think that they’ve taken every step they’ve needed to take, but not soon enough to have had a real impact,” McConnell said of the Biden administration. Nonetheless, he described his approach to Biden this way: “What I’m trying to do is, in a respectful way, get him to change. I’m not trying to take political advantage of the situation. I’m trying to influence him.”

FUNDING FIGHT FINISHED: A $1.5 trillion government spending package is ready for Biden's signature after it passed the Senate Thursday night in a 68-31 vote.

The deal provides a major funding hike to the Pentagon. National defense programs — including the Pentagon, nuclear programs and other security initiatives — get $782 billion for the full year, roughly $29 billion more than Biden sought. The package also includes nearly $14 billion in emergency military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine.

The package ultimately won strong backing from Democrats, despite progressives' push to hold the line on defense spending. Democrats ultimately agreed to back a big Pentagon increase to lock in a major boost for spending on their domestic priorities.

No Democratic senators opposed the spending package. When the defense portion of omnibus came up for a vote Wednesday in the House, just 15 Democrats voted against it.

Our colleagues SARAH FERRIS and CONNOR O'BRIEN previewed the progressive defense dilemma earlier this week.

EGYPT DEAL SEALED: The Senate on Thursday also rejected in a whopping 19-80 vote a resolution from Sen. RAND PAUL (R-Ky.) to cancel a $2.2 billion sale of a dozen C-130J cargo planes to Egypt over the country's human rights record.

The Biden administration has walked a fine line with Egypt, notifying lawmakers about the sale in January within days of withholding $130 million in military aid due to human rights concerns. But most senators were fine allowing the sale of non-lethal equipment to go forward. Connor has the details.

Broadsides

RUBIO BASHES NSC STAFFER: Sen. MARCO RUBIO wishes there were a dislike button on Instagram so he could smash it for a pic by a top NSC staffer.

Rubio tweeted out an IG picture of JUAN GONZALEZ, the NSC’s Western Hemisphere lead. He recently traveled to Venezuela for a meeting with officials in Caracas, namely to secure the release of Americans hostages and convince Caracas to export oil to the U.S. But the Florida lawmaker — a longtime Venezuela hawk — didn’t appreciate the photo Gonzalez posted on his personal account.

“This is Biden’s NSC staffer for Western Hemisphere posting on instagram like he is a celebrity as he flies in the luxury of a government jet to #Caracas to meet with a narco-dictator responsible for 6 million refugees who have had to flee #Venezuela,” Rubio tweeted.

It’s unclear precisely why this bothered Rubio so much. Perhaps if Gonzalez were on his way somewhere other than Venezuela it wouldn’t have irked him. Still, this social media squabble underscores the intense resistance the White House is facing for thawing relations with Venezuela, including from some Democrats.

Gonzalez did return home having secured the release of two unlawfully detained Americans, however.

3,77a205fe-ef17-4063-a03d-715dce156c3b,[],2022-03-09,"WASHINGTON — The Pentagon on Wednesday slammed the door on a Polish proposal for providing Ukraine with MiG fighter jets, saying allied efforts against the Russian invasion should be focused on more useful weaponry and the MiG transfer with a U.S. and NATO connection would run a “high risk” of escalating the war.

By rebuffing the proposal involving the the Polish jets, the Pentagon appeared anxious to move beyond what had become an awkward disconnect with a NATO ally at a time when President Joe Biden has stressed the need for a unified and coordinated response to Russia's war.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has pleaded repeatedly for the U.S. to provide his military with more aircraft — presented as an apparent alternative to establishing a “no-fly zone” over Ukraine to suppress Russian air power. The “no-fly” idea was rejected earlier by Washington and NATO as an unnecessary risk of escalation.

Last week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken had said Washington was looking at a proposal under which Poland would supply Kyiv with the Soviet-era fighters, which Ukrainian pilots are trained to fly, and in turn receive American F-16s to make up for the loss.

But Poland wanted no part of that, concerned about involving itself too directly in conflict with Russia. Poland then said it was prepared to hand over all 28 of its MiG-29 planes — but to NATO by flying them to the U.S. air base in Ramstein, Germany, from where they would somehow be flown to Ukraine.

That was the arrangement the Pentagon turned aside.

Marek Magierowski, Poland’s ambassador to the United States, indicated the Polish government had gotten the message.

“Our American partners rejected this proposal, because they have come to the conclusion that it was too escalatory,” Magierowski told CNN. He said Poland understands and ""this is what we need now to emphasize again -- the unity and cohesion of NATO. So, let’s move on.”

U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that in a phone call, Zelenskyy on Wednesday again asked urgently for the United States to provide warplanes, anti-aircraft missiles and other weaponry.

However, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin discussed the MiG transfer proposal with his Polish counterpart and explained why Washington found it untenable.

Kirby said the Biden administration is talking with other countries about “alternative options” for supporting Ukraine's most pressing defense needs two weeks into its war, especially more ground-based weapons to counter Russian tanks and aircraft in what has been largely a ground war. Kirby said those could include surface-to-air missile batteries and shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles.

“Secretary Austin thanked the minister for Poland's willingness to continue to look for ways to assist Ukraine,"" Kirby said. “He stressed that we do not support the transfer of additional fighter aircraft to the Ukrainian air force at this time and therefore have no desire to see them in our custody, either.”

U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris arrived in Warsaw Wednesday night for consultations, but the White House said she was not directly involved with the matter of the planes.

Kirby cited three main reasons Austin rejected the Polish offer, starting with the U.S. view that it would be wiser to provide Ukraine with weaponry that would more directly strengthen its defenses, including anti-armor and air defense systems. Kirby said the Russian air force, while much larger than Ukraine's, has not played a lead role in the Russian offensive and has been of limited effectiveness due to Ukraine's use of ground-based air defenses, which include Stinger missiles.

Kirby said Ukraine still has a significant number of its own aircraft, and the U.S. believes that adding aircraft from other nations “is not likely to significantly change the effectiveness of the Ukrainian air force relative to Russian capabilities.”

Also, the U.S. intelligence community has assessed that transferring MiG fighters to Ukraine “may be mistaken as escalatory and could result in significant Russian reaction that might increase the prospects of a military escalation with NATO,"" Kirby said. Ukraine is not a NATO member, but some of its neighbors are, and the alliance is trying to avoid a spillover of the war.

While Kirby's statement appeared to bring an end to the Polish proposal, the appearance of a public disagreement among allies could have more lasting impact. Last week, the U.S. government threw Poland a hot potato with the request to send the Soviet-made fighter jets.

That plan took the U.S. off guard. By late Tuesday, the Pentagon called it “untenable.” On Wednesday, Secretary of State Blinken said that ultimately each country would have to decide for itself how to help Ukraine.

Poland is a crucial ally in the Ukraine crisis. It is hosting thousands of American troops and is taking in more people fleeing the war in Ukraine than any other nation in the midst of the largest European refugee crisis in decades.

It has suffered invasions and occupations by Russia for centuries and still fears Russia despite being a member of NATO. It already had to contend with the Russian territory of Kaliningrad on its northeastern border and is uncomfortably aware of Russian troops across another border, with Belarus.

In a visit Wednesday to Vienna, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki insisted that Poland is not a party to the Ukraine war and that any decision on whether to send the fighter jets could not be one for Warsaw alone.

It carries the risk of “very dramatic scenarios, even worse than those we are dealing with today,"" Morawiecki argued.

Michal Baranowski, director of the Warsaw office of the German Marshall Fund think tank, told The Associated Press the Warsaw government “was blindsided and surprised” by Blinken's public statement last week. “This was seen as pressure from the U.S. on Warsaw. And therefore the reaction was to put the ball back in the U.S. government’s court,"" Baranowski said.

It all “should have been dealt with behind the scenes,” he said.

WARSAW, Poland -- The Pentagon on Wednesday slammed the door on any plans to provide MiG fighter jets to Ukraine, even through a second country, calling it a “high-risk” venture that would not significantly change the effectiveness of the Ukrainian Air Force.

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Polish counterpart on Wednesday and told him the U.S. assessment. He said the U.S. is pursuing other options that would provide more critical military needs to Ukraine such as air defense and anti-armor weapons systems.

Poland had said it was prepared to hand over MiG-29 planes to NATO that could then be delivered to Ukraine, but Kirby said U.S. intelligence concluded that it could be considered escalatory and trigger a “significant” Russian reaction.

Kirby’s remarks went beyond his comments in a statement Tuesday, rejecting Poland's offer to give fighter jets to the United States for transfer to Ukraine.

He said individual NATO nations can make up their own minds on what assistance to give Ukraine, but it’s questionable whether any would provide fighters without U.S. support.

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.

WARSAW, Poland (AP) — An awkward dispute between the United States and NATO ally Poland is casting doubt on Ukraine’s hopes to obtain the MiG fighter jets it says it needs to defend against Russia’s invasion.

No one wants to stand out alone behind the action, which could invite Russian retaliation.

The U.S. government threw Poland a hot potato with a request to send Soviet-made fighter jets — which Ukrainian pilots are trained to fly — to Ukraine. Poland threw it right back, saying it was prepared to hand over all 28 of its MiG-29 planes — but to NATO by flying them to the U.S. base in Ramstein, Germany.

That plan took the U.S. off guard. By late Tuesday, the Pentagon rejected it as “untenable.” On Wednesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that ultimately each country would have to decide for itself. In diplospeak: “Poland’s proposal shows there are complexities that the issue presents when it comes to providing security assistance.""

Will Ukraine get the planes? Vice President Kamala Harris was arriving in Warsaw late Wednesday, though the White House said she would not be negotiating the planes issue. Blinken said the U.S. was consulting with Poland and other NATO allies. Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley were also consulting with their Polish counterparts, the White House said.

In the scenario Poland proposed, it would be up to the entire NATO alliance, which makes its decisions unanimously, to decide.

Poland is already taking in more people fleeing the war in Ukraine than any other nation in the midst of the largest refugee crisis in decades.

It has suffered invasions and occupations by Russia for centuries, and still fears Russia despite being a member of NATO. It already had to contend with the Russian territory of Kaliningrad on its northeastern border and is uncomfortably aware of Russian troops across another border, with Belarus.

In a visit Wednesday to Vienna, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki insisted that Poland is a not a party to the Ukraine war and that any decision on whether to send the fighter jets could not be one for Warsaw alone.

It carries the risk of “very dramatic scenarios, even worse than those we are dealing with today,"" Morawiecki argued.

Though big and strong, NATO, too, is deeply concerned about any act that might drag its 30 member countries into a wider war with a nuclear armed Russia. Under NATO’s collective security guarantee, an attack on one member must be considered an attack on all. It’s the main reason that Ukraine’s appeals for a no-fly zone have gone unanswered. Ukraine is not a NATO member.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Wednesday again praised the bravery of the Ukrainian people and armed forces in the face of an assault by a much bigger adversary but underlined that the world’s largest security organization must stand by its “painful decision” not to police the skies over the country.

Days earlier U.S. Secretary Blinken said Washington had given a “green light” to the idea of supplying Ukraine with fighter jets and was looking at a proposal under which Poland would supply Kyiv with the Soviet-era fighters and in turn receive American F-16s to make up for the loss.

Michal Baranowski, director of the Warsaw office of the German Marshall Fund think tank, told The Associated Press the Warsaw government “was blindsided and surprised” by Blinken's public request.

“This was seen as pressure from the U.S. on Warsaw. And therefore the reaction was to put the ball back in the U.S. government’s court,"" Baranowski said in an interview.

The shipments include anti-armor and anti-aircraft missiles which could be used against Russian tanks and helicopters .

The weapons are being used by Ukrainian fighters to push back Russian forces.

As fighting in Ukraine enters its third week, reports this week revealed heavily-laden military cargo jets are pouring into an airfield across the border, stacked with weapons and military equipment to help Ukraine's forces hold back the advance of Russian troops.

Throughout the buildup to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, NATO countries, including the US, insisted they would not send troops to the region amid concern that the presence of their personnel on the ground would lead to a dangerous escalation of the conflict.

That stance has continued since Moscow ordered its troops into Ukraine on the morning of February 24. Instead, NATO nations and other countries are supplying Ukraine's defence forces - vastly outgunned and outnumbered by Russia's military - with weapons and equipment that Kyiv hopes will be able to help staunch Russia's advance.

Around 17,000 anti-armor weapons have been sent to Ukraine in the last number of weeks and are being pressed into use against Russian tanks and other hardware. As of March 8, Ukrainian fighters had destroyed over 1,000 armored personnel carriers, 303 tanks, 120 artillery systems and 80 helicopters, The Kyiv Independent claimed.

LVIV, Ukraine, March 11 (Reuters) - Ukraine said Belarus could be planning to invade its territory on Friday and accused Russia of trying to drag its ally into the war by staging air attacks on Belarus from Ukrainian air space.

Belarus has served as a staging post for Russian troops, missiles and aircraft, both before and after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, but it has not deployed its own forces in active battle.

Ukraine's military accused Russian aircraft of firing at Belarusian border villages from Ukrainian air space on Friday to provide an excuse for an offensive.

""This is a PROVOCATION! The goal is to involve the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus in the war with Ukraine!"" Ukraine's Air Force Command said in an online statement.

The Kremlin did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Air Force Command's statement.

The alleged attacks took place as Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko was meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, according to Ukraine's State Centre for Strategic Communications.

The result of this meeting could be an attack by Belarus across Ukraine's northern border, the centre said in statement.

""According to preliminary data, Belarusian troops may be drawn into an invasion on March 11 at 21:00 (1900 GMT),"" it said.

Last week, Lukashenko, a close Kremlin ally, said Belarusian armed forces were not taking part and would not take part in what Russia calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. read more

Ukrainian senior officials said Russia was doing everything possible to draw Belarus into the conflict, after failing in what Western countries say was an initial plan for a lightning assault on the capital. read more

""We also understand that the Belarusian government has been doing everything possible to avoid joining this war,"" Ukrainian deputy interior minister Yevheniy Yenin said on national television on Friday.

There was no immediate comment on the allegations from Belarus.

Ukraine's top security official Oleksiy Danilov said Ukraine had so far shown restraint towards Belarus, despite Russia using it as a launchpad for attacks on Ukraine. But he warned on Friday if ""one fighter crosses our border, we will fight back.""

Meanwhile Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy struck a more conciliatory note in a speech to the government of neighbouring Poland, which also shares a border with Belarus.

""I really want these words to be heard by our common neighbors - Belarusians. Peace between relatives, peace between neighbors, peace between brothers, we must achieve this with them too. And we definitely will,"" Zelenskiy said.
