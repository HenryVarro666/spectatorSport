The suspect, whom the SBU did not identify, was accused of being on ""thousands"" of phone calls to Russian officials, including senior military officers and of sending text messages to Ukrainian officials suggesting that they surrender. The equipment seized was used to route Ukrainian mobile phone traffic to Russian networks, according to Victor Zhora, a senior cybersecurity official in the Ukrainian government.

It's the latest development in the ongoing battle for communications networks in Ukraine as the Russian military continues to shell the capital of Kyiv. From Moscow to the front lines of the war in Ukraine, the ability to communicate to troops and citizens alike has been contested by suspected Russian and pro-Ukrainian hackers.

Hackers last week caused outages at a Ukrainian internet service provider Triolan, which has customers in major cities. Triolan blamed ""the enemy,"" a reference to Russia, but did not provide evidence supporting that claim.

Carmine Cicalese, former chief of cyberspace and information operations at US Army headquarters, said functional mobile phone networks are of particular importance to non-military personnel in Ukraine who are taking up arms against Russia and who do not have access to tactical communications equipment.

Ukraine's top law-enforcement agency said on Tuesday that it has detained a suspected ""hacker"" who was allegedly aiding Russian troops technologically in the eastern European country and helping Russia send text messages to Ukrainian forces urging them to surrender.

The accused hacker, who was not identified, also allegedly helped the Russian military send ""commands and instructions"" through mobile phone networks ""to advanced groups of Russian invaders"" in Ukraine amid Russia's more than two week war with the country, the Security Service of Ukraine said in a Facebook post.

Through the alleged hacker, Russian forces ""made anonymous phone calls from Russia to the mobile phones of the invaders in Ukraine"" and ""sent SMS to Ukrainian security officers and civil servants with proposals to surrender and side with the occupiers,"" the government agency said.

According to the Security Service of Ukraine, ""up to a thousand calls"" were made through the suspected hacker in one day, with many of the calls from the ""top leadership"" of the Russian army.

""The collaborator has been detained so far, all his equipment has been confiscated,"" the Ukrainian security service said. ""The perpetrator was declared a suspect.""

The law enforcement agency explained that the man ""will be held accountable with all the severity of the law.""

""The blood of tens or even hundreds of killed Ukrainians is on his hands,"" the security service said, adding, ""We continue to work! Glory to Ukraine!""

The Russian army has been targeting Ukraine's communication systems during its invasion as Ukrainian forces put up fierce resistance to Russian invaders.

Meanwhile, Cathal McDaid, the chief technology officer at the cybersecurity firm AdaptiveMobile, told Motherboard that Ukraine's disclosure about the alleged hacker ""adds a bit of depth to the question as to why the Ukrainian mobile networks are still up — they still have some utility to Russian forces.""

Russian President Vladimir Putin launched Russia's war against Ukraine on February 24, attacking several cities with military strikes.

The SBU shared the details in a Tweeter and a Telegram message posted around 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. ET), including footage purporting to show the hacker and his communications system, though the information has not been independently confirmed.

According to the SBU’s Telegram message, the hacker was helping route calls from inside Russia to the cellphones of Russian troops in Ukraine, and was also texting Ukrainian security guards and officials offering to surrender.

Images shared by the SBU claim to show the hardware and software used for these activities and appear to be compatible with a relay system for voice and SMS communications.

In one tweet thread, Cathal Mc Daid, CTO at Adaptive Mobile Security, explained the devices used and their importance. Mc Daid said the system consisted of a SIM box server that could switch between 128 different SIM cards, coupled with GSM gateways to connect voice calls and SMS messages to a local mobile network, and unknown software to manage messaging and call forwarding.

Mc Daid also said these systems were unreliable and should not be used for military communications.

The use of civilian-grade insecure communications systems now seems normal for Russian troops operating in Ukraine. Since the start of the invasion, there have been numerous reports of Ukrainian security forces intercepting messages sent between Russian military units, a feat made possible by the lack of encryption of Russian communications.

At the start of the invasion, Russian troops reportedly reduced their own ability to use encrypted telephone handsets by destroying local 3G and 4G masts, removing the mobile data networks the phones rely on. With the Russian military relying on unencrypted communications, Ukrainian intelligence services were able to intercept sensitive communications and, in some cases, broadcast them around the world, as happened with reports of the Death of Russian General Vitaly Gerasimov.

Footage of the conflict shared on social media also suggests that in some cases Russian troops were using unencrypted portable radios for battlefield communications. The Russian Ministry of Defense has previously hinted that it has distributed encrypted tactical radios to the majority of the Russian armed forces, but as analysts from the Royal United Services Institute (a UK defense and security think tank) observe that there are indications that the delivery of the radios was hampered by corruption.

The outdated and poorly maintained nature of Russian communications devices also appears to be reflected in the condition of much of the heavy equipment used by the Russian military, even as troops embark on crucial military operations like the assault on the capital kyiv. Reports from the battlefield indicate that some of the Russian tank units use Soviet-era T-72 vehicles, a model first produced more than 50 years ago.

However, despite numerous technical and logistical problems, the Russian forces vastly outnumbered the Ukrainian army and showed no signs of slowing down their assault as the war entered a dangerous new phase.",https://goodwordnews.com/a-phone-relay-capture-could-be-the-latest-of-russias-communication-problems-in-ukraine/

Sanger']",2022-03-16 00:00:00,"ODESSA, Ukraine — Ukrainian forces carried out counter-offensives against Russian positions on Wednesday, seeking to inflict what one official called “maximum losses,” even as the invading Russian military stepped up its lethal attacks on cities.

In Mariupol, an airstrike destroyed a theater where about 1,000 people had taken shelter, according to city and regional administrators, and photos and videos posted online showed the burning wreckage of the building.

Officials in Mariupol, the besieged southern city that has suffered the most intense bombardment, said they could not yet estimate the number of casualties among civilians, who might have been in a bomb shelter beneath the theater. The strike came as 11,000 residents evacuated the city on Wednesday, according to its City Council.

In a video address to Ukrainians early Thursday morning, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine called for more sanctions against Russia and said it was a “terrorist state.”

“Our hearts are broken by what Russia is doing to our people,” he said, “to our Mariupol.”

After falling back under a relentless pounding over the war’s first weeks, Ukrainian troops tried to gain some momentum with counterattacks on Russian positions outside of Kyiv and in the Russian-occupied city of Kherson, in Ukraine’s south, a senior Ukrainian military official said.

Rather than seek to regain lost territory, Ukrainian forces tried to cause as much destruction and death as possible, attacking Russian troops and equipment with tanks, fighter jets and artillery, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military information.

“In the task of inflicting maximum losses, we’ve done excellently,” the official said.

American intelligence officials said their conservative estimate of Russian troop deaths was at least 7,000, a staggering number that carries implications for both combat effectiveness and morale. Western defense and intelligence agencies estimate that Ukraine also has suffered thousands of combatants killed.

Mr. Zelensky addressed Congress via video link on Wednesday, asking for more aid, and President Biden promised more weaponry. The administration plans to provide Ukraine with high-tech defensive weapons that are easily portable and require little training or logistical support to use, according to U.S. and European officials.

Meanwhile, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia falsely accused Ukraine of seeking weapons of mass destruction and asserted that what he called an “economic blitzkrieg” by the West, aimed at destroying Russia, had failed.

Mr. Putin also sneered at Russians who oppose the war, saying the Russian people could distinguish “true patriots from the scum and the traitors, and just to spit them out like a midge that accidentally flew into their mouths.”

In a televised videoconference with top officials, he once again falsely described the government in Kyiv, led by a Jewish president and prime minister, as being “pro-Nazi” and on its way to acquiring nuclear weapons. “Their aim, of course, would have been Russia,” he said.

And then he went deeper into unreality, accusing the government in Kyiv of disregard for the suffering of the Ukrainian people that his own forces were bombing every day.

“The fact that people are dying, that hundreds of thousands, millions have become refugees, that there is a real humanitarian catastrophe in cities held by neo-Nazis and armed criminals,” he said. “They’re indifferent.”

Ukrainian and Russian negotiators held a third consecutive day of talks on a possible settlement to the conflict, and in typical fashion, the Kremlin left a muddy picture of its intentions. Mr. Putin’s bellicose, often false statements, larded with World War II references, clashed with more conciliatory comments from his underlings.

But little appeared to have changed on the battlefield. The war in Ukraine, about to enter its fourth week, has become a grinding daily slog with little evidence of significant gains for either side.

Details of the Ukrainian offensive could not be fully established independently, though several top Ukrainian officials, including key aides to Mr. Zelensky, confirmed that the counterattacks were underway.

In Kyiv, missile strikes and heavy artillery sounded overnight and in the early morning on Wednesday in exchanges in the outlying suburbs that were notably heavier and louder than in previous days. Two people were wounded and a residential building was damaged in a strike that landed near the city zoo, the second time in two days that shells have landed close to the city center.

Satellite pictures from Tuesday showed heavy black smoke above the Kherson airport, where the senior military official said Ukrainian forces had targeted parked Russian military aircraft.

Kherson was the first (and so far, only) major city to be fully taken over by Russian forces, which have turned it into a forward military base from which they have launched attacks on surrounding cities and villages, according to Ukrainian officials. On Tuesday, the Russian Defense Ministry announced that it had taken control of the entire Kherson region, giving Russian forces a significant foothold in southern Ukraine that Ukraine’s military will have difficulty dislodging.

Even so, neither side can be said to have made much progress militarily. The Institute for the Study of War, which has been tracking developments closely, noted in a Tuesday evening assessment that, for nearly two weeks, Russian forces have not been conducting extensive simultaneous attacks that would allow them to seize control of multiple areas at once in Ukraine. And they are unlikely to do so in the next week, it said.

In the absence of significant military gains, Russian forces on Wednesday continued a campaign of terror against Ukrainian civilians.

At least 10 people were killed when a Russian strike hit a bread line in Chernihiv, a city north of Kyiv that has been subject to intense shelling by Russian troops seeking to move on the capital. Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office said in a statement that the attack occurred at about 10 a.m. as people were lined up at a grocery store. Photos released by the prosecutor’s office showed several bodies scattered around a dirt yard.

Using heavy artillery, cruise missiles and fighter jets, Russian forces have systematically targeted civilian areas with no military presence, striking apartment buildings, schools and hospitals in cities and villages all over a broad front in the north, east and south of Ukraine. The attacks may have killed thousands of civilians, though reaching a precise count of the dead has been impossible.

Saying it was “profoundly concerned” by Russia’s use of force, the International Court of Justice ordered Russia on Wednesday to suspend its military operations immediately, pending its full review of a case submitted by Ukraine last month. However, the order was not expected to lead to any immediate cessation in the onslaught.

According to the United Nations, at least 726 civilians have been killed, including 64 children, since the invasion began on Feb. 24, though its figures do not include areas where fighting has been heaviest, like Kharkiv and Mariupol. In Mariupol alone, which has been turned into a hellscape of burning and decimated buildings, local authorities say at least 2,400 have been killed, and probably far more.

In Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, the municipal emergency services agency first reported on Wednesday that 500 civilians had been killed since the war began, but then revised that number to 100 later in the day. In any case, the agency said in a statement on Facebook, the true number of deaths could be much higher, noting that emergency workers were continuing to scour the rubble of residential neighborhoods for more bodies, often under fire.

Mr. Zelensky’s appeal to Congress on Wednesday was in part a desperate effort to obtain the weaponry and defenses capable of fending off such attacks. Central to this appeal was a call for a no-fly zone to be imposed over Ukraine, aimed at preventing Russian fighter jets, which cause severe destruction, from operating over Ukrainian territory. “Close the sky” has become a rallying cry for Ukrainian officials and regular citizens.

“Russia has turned the Ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people,” Mr. Zelensky said.

Knowing that the request had little chance of being approved, given that it would thrust American pilots into direct confrontation with the Russians, Mr. Zelensky quickly pivoted to something to which Republicans and Democrats have been far more receptive: asking for more weapons to enable his people to keep up the fight themselves.

Mr. Biden announced $800 million in new military aid to Ukraine, including antiaircraft and antitank missiles, body armor, vehicles, drones and small arms, bringing to $2 billion the amount delivered or pledged since early last year. But as expected, he did not offer to deliver warplanes or enforce a no-fly zone.

The United States and its allies have relied primarily on financial sanctions that are already devastating the Russian economy.

Russian officials close to the talks said Wednesday there had been signs of progress, though even there, the picture was unclear. They said the idea of a neutral Ukraine, with a status like that of Sweden or Austria, was on the table, which their Ukrainian counterparts disputed.

Sergey V. Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, told a Russian television network that the status of the Russian language and Russian news outlets in Ukraine were under discussion, and that “there are concrete formulas that are close to being agreed on.”
