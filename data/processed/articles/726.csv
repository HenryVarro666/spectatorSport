Demonstrators have been seen waving Ukrainian flags at what appear to be peaceful rallies in Kherson, Energodar, and Berdyansk.

Hundreds of protesters have been seen standing in a square in the port city of Kherson in the south of Ukraine, which is home to more than 280,000 people, and one of the first locations to fall under Russian control.

One video, which has not been verified by i , shows crowds waving Ukrainian flags in Kherson, chanting “Kherson is Ukraine!”.

In Berdyansk, a small Ukrainian port city in the south east of the country, 200 to 250 people gathered for a rally, according to Belarusian outlet Nexta.

There have also been unconfirmed reports of people being detained and beaten at the Berdyansk protest.

One video of the protest in Berdyansk, which has not been verified, shows men in military uniforms beating protesters as they lay on the ground.

Hromadske International reported at least 1,500 residents went to a peaceful rally in south eastern city of Energodar and demanded the release of its deputy mayor Ivan Samoilyuk, who Ukrainian officials claim has been kidnapped by Russian forces.

In another unverified clip recorded in Energodar, a crowd of people are seen crowding around a jeep as a Russian soldier holding an assault rifle stands outside the driver’s door.

He then fires his weapon into the air in a apparent attempt to disperse the crowd – but they continue to swarm the vehicle. The soldier then gets in his vehicle before speeding away.

In recent weeks, there has been similar acts of defiance against Russian occupation in the cities and others in Ukrainian which have been taken over by Russian troops.

The Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security published the relevant photos and videos on its Telegram channel, Ukrinform reports.

“Despite the fact that the invaders impose a strict administrative and police regime in the temporarily occupied territories, Ukrainians are not afraid of holding mass protests. It is impossible to stop Ukrainians. They are really citizens of their country,"" the statement reads.

In particular, residents of Kherson once again took to the streets with blue and yellow symbols on March 20. The occupiers, who had been waiting for a warm welcome here, did not expect such resistance.

A mass march took place in Kakhovka under the slogans ""One, united, free Ukraine!""

The occupiers came to a traditional peaceful rally in Berdyansk. They fired several shots into the air and detained about 10 people.

The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine stated on March 19 that even Russian intelligence had come to the conclusion that it would be impossible to establish pro-Russian authorities in the territories temporarily controlled by the occupiers due to strong opposition from Ukrainians.

On February 24, Russian president Putin announced the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine. Russian troops shell and destroy key infrastructure, massively fire on residential areas of Ukrainian cities, towns, and villages using artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, and ballistic missiles.

Martial law was imposed in Ukraine and general mobilization was announced.

Oleh Baturin, journalist from the town of Kakhovka of Kherson region, who was held captive by the Russians for eight days, was released on March 20.

Source: Baturin on his sister's Facebook

Quote of Baturin: ""On March 12, at 5 p.m., I was caught at the Kakhovka bus station. They beat me. They humiliated me. They threatened me. They said they would kill me.

Almost eight days. 187 hours of captivity. Virtually no food. Some days almost without water. No soap, no change of clothes. Not understanding where I am. But they clearly knew for what. They wanted to break, trample. Show what will happen to every journalist: you will be deprived. You will be killed.

For almost 8 days I sat with my head tilted or covered. They were afraid I could see their faces. ""

In a statement, President Biden said his administration was reiterating previous warnings ""based on evolving intelligence that the Russian Government is exploring options for potential cyberattacks"".

The White House said it was a ""critical"" moment to boost defences.

This is the latest in a series of warnings about possible fall-out in cyberspace from the conflict.

In particular, there have been concerns that Russia might retaliate for sanctions by hitting back at the US and Western economies through cyber-attacks.

So far these attacks have not materialised.

But this latest warning does suggest US intelligence has seen some indications of Russian activity on computer networks that could be the prelude for some kind of attack – however, they acknowledge that this does not mean that such an attack will definitely take place.

The public warning may be designed to act as a deterrent.

US and UK cyber officials have both been briefing executives of major organisations over a period of months, especially those within critical infrastructure, to warn them of the risks and encourage them to ensure they have the best possible defences in place.",https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-60802572?ns_mchannel=social&ns_source=twitter&ns_campaign=bbc_live&ns_linkname=623754da980bea49f4b7d7aa&Russia%20confirms%20senior%20naval%20officer%20killed%20in%20Mariupol&2022-03-20T17:12:34.995Z&ns_fee=0&pinned_post_locator=urn%3Aasset%3Acf3aecdb-2f00-44c4-ad14-9126d4fe86e2&pinned_post_asset_id=623754da980bea49f4b7d7aa&pinned_post_type=share
