Seven people were killed and 22 injured on Tuesday when a Russian missile struck a Ukrainian administration building in Mykolaiv.

On Telegram, Mykolaiv's Governor Vitaliy Kim posted striking video of the Russian cruise missile seconds before it blasted a hole into the building in the largest attack on the city since the start of the war.

In a video posted on Telegram, Kim said Russia is choosing to destroy the city because they know they cannot capture it. The Mykolaiv Regional State Administration building houses Kim's office.

A woman living across the street from the administration building told BBC News that Kim's office was targeted because ""he gives confidence and strength"" to his people and ""infuriates Putin and his followers the fact that he doesn't give up and doesn't let them go further to Odessa.""

In his Telegram video, Kim said he believes the Russians waited until people had arrived for work on Tuesday morning and he was lucky to have overslept.

Mykolaiv is in the southern part of Ukraine near the Black Sea and northwest of Crimea — the area seized by Russia in 2014. Since the start of the war, Ukrainian forces have been blocking the Russian's attempts to seize the city and advance along the Black Sea coast.

In a video address to the Danish Parliament, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attack saying ""there were no military targets in Mykolaiv, the people of Mykolaiv posed no threat to Russia.""

On Telegram, Ukrainian emergency services said the blast destroyed nine floors of the building and search and rescue missions are still ongoing.",https://www.businessinsider.com/video-captures-russian-missile-seconds-before-hitting-government-building-2022-3

Putin began a full-scale invasion last month, according to U.S. officials.

Russia has also asked China for additional economic assistance, to help counteract the battering its economy has taken from broad sanctions imposed by the United States and European and Asian nations, according to an official.

American officials, determined to keep secret their means of collecting the intelligence on Russia’s requests, declined to describe further the kind of military weapons or aid that Moscow is seeking. The officials also declined to discuss any reaction by China to the requests.

President Xi Jinping of China has strengthened a partnership with Mr. Putin and has stood by him as Russia has stepped up its military campaign in Ukraine, destroying cities and killing hundreds or thousands of civilians. American officials are watching China closely to see whether it will act on any requests of aid from Russia. Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, met on Monday in Rome with Yang Jiechi, a member of the Chinese Communist Party’s elite Politburo and director of the party’s Central Foreign Affairs Commission.

Mr. Sullivan intended to warn Mr. Yang about any future Chinese efforts to bolster Russia in its war or undercut Ukraine, the United States and their partners. The meeting came one day after U.S. officials told The New York Times about Russia’s request for military and economic aid from China. It had been scheduled before the war in Ukraine began and was planned as a follow-up discussion to a video summit meeting between President Biden and Mr. Xi in November.

“We are communicating directly, privately to Beijing that there will absolutely be consequences for large-scale sanctions evasion efforts or support to Russia to backfill them,” Mr. Sullivan said on CNN on Sunday.

“We will not allow that to go forward and allow there to be a lifeline to Russia from these economic sanctions from any country, anywhere in the world,” he said.

Mr. Sullivan did not make any explicit mention of potential military support from China, but other U.S. officials spoke about the request from Russia on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of diplomatic and intelligence matters.

Liu Pengyu, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said he had never heard of the request from Russia. “The current situation in Ukraine is indeed disconcerting,” he said, adding that Beijing wants to see a peaceful settlement. “The high priority now is to prevent the tense situation from escalating or even getting out of control.”

The Biden administration is seeking to lay out for China the consequences of its alignment with Russia and penalties it will incur if it continues or increases its support. Some U.S. officials argue it might be possible to dissuade Beijing from ramping up its assistance to Moscow. Chinese leaders may be content to offer rhetorical support for Moscow and may not want to further enmesh themselves with Mr. Putin by providing military support for the war, those U.S. officials say.

Mr. Sullivan said China “was aware before the invasion took place that Vladimir Putin was planning something,” but added that the Chinese might not have known the full extent of the Russian leader’s plans. “It’s very possible that Putin lied to them, the same way he lied to Europeans and others,” he said.

Mr. Xi has met with Mr. Putin 38 times as national leaders, more than with any other head of state, and the two share a drive to weaken American power.

Traditionally, China has bought military equipment from Russia rather than the other way around. Russia has increased its sales of weaponry to China in recent years. But China has advanced missile and drone capabilities that Russia could use in its Ukraine campaign.

Although Russia on Sunday launched a missile barrage on a military training ground in western Ukraine that killed at least 35 people, there has been some evidence that Russian missile supplies have been running low, according to independent analysts.

Last week, the White House criticized China for helping spread Kremlin disinformation about the United States and Ukraine. In recent days, Chinese diplomats, state media organizations and government agencies have used a range of platforms and official social media accounts to amplify a conspiracy theory that says the Pentagon has been financing biological and chemical weapons labs in Ukraine. Right-wing political figures in the United States have also promoted the theory.

On Friday, Russia called a United Nations Security Council meeting to present its claims about the labs, and the Chinese ambassador to the U.N., Zhang Jun, supported his Russian counterpart.

“Now that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them,” Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, wrote on Twitter last Wednesday.

China is also involved in the Iran nuclear negotiations, which have stalled because of new demands from Russia on relief from the sanctions imposed by Western nations in response to the Ukraine war.

American officials are trying to determine to what degree China would support Russia’s position in those talks. Before Russia raised the requests, officials from the nations involved had been close to clinching a return to a version of the Obama-era nuclear limits agreement from which President Donald J. Trump withdrew. Mr. Sullivan might bring up Iran with Mr. Yang on Monday.

Current and former U.S. officials say the Rome meeting is important, given the lives at stake in the Ukraine war and the possibility of Russia and China presenting a geopolitical united front against the United States and its allies in the years ahead.

“This meeting is critical and possibly a defining moment in the relationship,” said Evan Medeiros, a Georgetown University professor who was a senior Asia director on the National Security Council during the Obama administration.

“I think what the U.S. is probably going to do is lay out the costs and consequences of China’s complicity and possible enabling of Russia’s invasion,” he said. “I don’t think anyone in the administration has illusions that the U.S. can pull China away from Russia.”

Some U.S. officials are looking for ways to compel Mr. Xi to distance himself from Mr. Putin on the war. Others see Mr. Xi as a lost cause and prefer to treat China and Russia as committed partners, hoping that might galvanize policies and coordination among Asian and European allies to contain them both.

Chinese officials have consistently voiced sympathy for Russia during the Ukraine war by reiterating Mr. Putin’s criticism of NATO and blaming the United States for starting the conflict. They have refrained from any mention of a Russian “war” or “invasion,” even as they express general concern for the humanitarian crisis.

They mention support for “sovereignty and territorial integrity,” a common catchphrase in Chinese diplomacy, but do not say explicitly which nation’s sovereignty they support — meaning the phrase could be interpreted as backing for Ukraine or an endorsement of Mr. Putin’s claims to restoring the territory of imperial Russia.

China and Russia issued a 5,000-word statement on Feb. 4 saying their partnership had “no limits” when Mr. Putin met with Mr. Xi before the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics in Beijing. Around that time, senior Chinese officials asked senior Russian officials not to invade Ukraine before the end of the Games, according to U.S. and European officials who cite a Western intelligence report.

Starting last November, American officials quietly held talks with Chinese officials, including the ambassador in Washington and the foreign minister, to discuss intelligence showing Mr. Putin’s troop buildup to persuade the Chinese to tell the Russians not to launch a war, U.S. officials said. The Chinese officials rebuffed the Americans at every meeting and expressed skepticism that Mr. Putin intended to invade Ukraine, the U.S. officials said.

William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director, said on Thursday in a Senate hearing that he believed Mr. Xi was “unsettled” by the Ukraine war.

Last Tuesday, Mr. Xi repeated China’s standard talking points on the war in a video call with the leaders of France and Germany. He also said that all nations should show “maximum restraint” and that China was “deeply grieved by the outbreak of war again on the European continent,” according to a Chinese readout. He did not say Russia had started the fighting.

U.S. and European officials say large Chinese companies will most likely refrain from openly violating sanctions on Russia for fear of jeopardizing their global commerce. On Thursday, some Russian news articles and commentary questioned China’s commitment to Russia after news agencies reported that China was refusing to send aircraft parts to the country.

Russia, as U.S. officials often remind the public, has relatively few friends or allies. And officials have said Russia’s outreach to its partners is a sign of the difficulties it is encountering in trying to subdue Ukraine.

As the United States and Europe have increased pressure and sanctions, Moscow has sought more aid.

In the buildup to war, Russia got assistance from Belarus, using its territory to launch part of the invasion. Minsk has also tried to help Moscow evade sanctions. Those actions prompted the European Union to impose sanctions on Belarus. The penalties limit money flowing into Belarus from Europe and block some Belarusian banks from using the SWIFT financial messaging system.

Michael Carpenter, the U.S. ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, accused Belarus of being a “co-aggressor” and having “stabbed your neighbor in the back,” referring to Ukraine.

President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus has said his military will not join in the war. But Russia has launched missiles from Belarus and evacuated some injured Russian soldiers to hospitals in that country.

President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, who owes his government’s survival to Russian intervention in the Syrian civil war, also declared support for Moscow’s invasion. Russia has tried to recruit Syrian fighters to join the Ukraine war, according to the Pentagon.

While there are no details of how many recruits Moscow has enlisted or if they have arrived in Ukraine, American officials said Russia’s efforts were an indicator of the strategic and tactical problems that have plagued its commanders.

Before the start of the war, European officials said, Russian military contractors with experience fighting in Syria and Libya secretly entered eastern Ukraine to help lay the groundwork for the invasion.",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/03/13/world/ukraine-russia-war

The remaining Ukrainian forces in the southern port city of Mariupol are still fighting, Ukrainian prime minister Denys Shmyhal said today.

Mr Shmyhal told ABC's ""This Week"" programme that troops were defying Russia's demand to lay down their arms and surrender and still had control of some parts of the city.

""The city still has not fallen,"" Mr Shmyhal said.

Earlier today, Russia's defence ministry ordered Ukrainian forces in Mariupol to stop fighting, with Moscow claiming its forces had almost completely seized the port city.

However several hours after the morning deadline, there was no sign of surrender by Ukrainian fighters holed up in the Azovstal iron and steelworks - one of Europe's biggest metallurgical plants.

Mr Shmyhal also said that he and Ukrainian finance officials would seek more financial assistance this week during International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings in Washington.

""We need more money for executing our humanitarian and social obligations,"" Mr Shmyhal added.

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

“There is what Russia says and there is what Russia does, and we’re focused on the latter,” Blinken said during a visit to Morocco. “And what Russia is doing is the continued brutalisation of Ukraine.”

He added that Russian officials were “profoundly fooling themselves… if they somehow believe that an effort to subjugate only the eastern part of Ukraine or the southern part of Ukraine… can succeed”.

Can Russia return to the world stage?

The war in Ukraine has turned Russian President Vladimir Putin into a pariah – at least in the West.

But at the same time, Russia remains a member of the United Nations Security Council, while powerful countries on the global stage, such as China and India, have not moved to condemn Moscow.

And analysts say that while Putin may be viewed as reprehensible now amid Ukraine’s war, casting Russia aside long-term looks unlikely because of the country’s strategic power.

UK detains Russian-owned superyacht in ‘warning’ to Putin

The United Kingdom’s government says it has detained a 38 million pounds ($49.6m) superyacht owned by a Russian businessman which was docked in London’s Canary Wharf financial district.

The 58.5-metre (192 feet) Dutch-built yacht, named Phi, was detained under the government’s sweeping sanctions on Russia, which include measures against scores of individuals and entities. It marked the first time the regulations have been used to detain a ship.

The government said Phi is owned by a Russian businessman but that ownership was “deliberately well hidden”, with the company the ship is registered to based in St Kitts and Nevis, and the ship carrying Maltese flags.

“Today we’ve detained a 38 million pound superyacht and turned an icon of Russia’s power and wealth into a clear and stark warning to Putin and his cronies,” Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said in a statement.

Russia to ‘cut back operations’ near Kyiv, Chernihiv to boost ‘trust’ in talks

Russia’s military claims it will “fundamentally cut back” operations near Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and the northern city of Chernihiv in order to boost talks between the two sides.

Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin said the move was meant “to increase trust” in the discussions aimed at ending the conflict and “create conditions for further negotiations”.

Ukraine’s military said it had noted withdrawals around Kyiv and Chernihiv.

Earlier on Tuesday, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said the main goal of Moscow’s offensive, which it describes as a “special military operation”, was to “liberate” eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region.

Kremlin says rules for gas payments in roubles being readied

The Kremlin has said Russia will work out practical arrangements by Thursday for foreign companies to pay for its gas in roubles. It added they needed to understand that Western “economic warfare” against Moscow had created a new set of market conditions.

“No one will supply gas for free, it is simply impossible, and you can pay for it only in roubles,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.

“All modalities are being developed so that this system is simple, understandable and feasible for respected European and international buyers,” he added.

Putin’s order last week to charge countries deemed “unfriendly” by Moscow in roubles for Russian gas has boosted the currency after it fell to all-time lows following Western powers’ rollout of sweeping sanctions over the attack on Ukraine.

The move drew strong criticism from European countries, which pay for Russian gas mostly in euros and say Russia is not entitled to redraw contracts.

Kremlin says Russia, US will need security dialogue ‘sooner or later’

The Kremlin has said Russia and the US will need to have a dialogue on security “sooner or later”, but warned the pair’s relations will inevitably be affected by remarks from Biden directed at Putin.

“Personal insults cannot but leave their mark on relations between heads of state,” Kremlin spokesman Peskov told reporters.

However, he added that “one way or another, sooner or later, we will have to speak about questions of strategic stability and security and so on”.

Biden has called Putin a “war criminal” and over the weekend said his Russian counterpart “cannot remain in power”.

‘Tension and panic’ in Mykolaiv: AJE correspondent

Al Jazeera’s Stefanie Dekker, reporting from Mykolaiv, says the city remains “very tense” after the alleged Russian attack on an administration building there.

“You can see a lot of the windows of the apartments here and in the surrounding area have been blown out,” Dekker said, reporting from the scene.

“We arrived here about an hour after that strike. There was another air raid siren and people were panicking. We saw rescue workers running away from the site, and then we all went into a shelter,” she added.

“We spoke to one lady who burst into tears, saying, ‘I cannot deal with this any more, it’s constant.’”

Mykolaiv is strategically located near Odesa, Ukraine’s largest port hub.

“It has held off a ground offensive for weeks but of course, Russia controls the skies and if it’s shelling, from the sea, from the ground, [and carrying out] air strikes … that does put ground troops at a disadvantage,” Dekker said.

UN nuclear watchdog chief in Ukraine to offer safety assistance

The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is in Ukraine for talks with senior government officials about ensuring the safety and security of its nuclear facilities, the UN’s nuclear watchdog has said.

Director General Rafael Grossi visit one of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants during his visit and is expected to hold a news conference when he returns to Vienna, where the IAEA has its headquarters, later this week.

“This conflict is already causing unimaginable human suffering and destruction,” he said in a statement. “The IAEA’s expertise and capabilities are needed to prevent it from also leading to a nuclear accident.”

Ukraine has 15 nuclear reactors at four active power plants, and is also home to the defunct Chernobyl facility, the site of a major nuclear disaster in 1986. Russian forces have taken control of Chernobyl and the Zaporizhzhia power plant, the largest in Europe.

ICRC calls for agreement on safe evacuations

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has called on Ukraine and Russia to reach a clear agreement for the safe evacuation of civilians from Mariupol and other places as vital supplies dwindle.

“Our concern is that the very intensity of the fighting is putting civilians in harm’s way,” Robert Mardini, the aid agency’s director general, told the Reuters news agency.

“The fact [is] that in places like Mariupol, civilians are not able to leave in safe conditions, there were no concrete agreements by parties to the conflict for [the] safe evacuation of civilians, nor has there been a green light to get humanitarian aid in,” he added, citing the besieged port city in southeastern Ukraine.

Mardini also said there was a “disinformation campaign” against the ICRC on social media as the aid agency moved to reject allegations it had taken part in the “forced evacuations of civilians to Russia” in a series of posts on Twitter.

False information is continuing to circulate about us online. This doesn’t just harm us as an organisation. It harms our people and everyone we seek to help, everyday, around the world. Check what you share. Here are the facts 👇 — ICRC (@ICRC) March 29, 2022

Ukraine says three killed in attack on Mykolaiv administration building

At least three people have been killed and 22 others wounded in a Russian attack on a regional administration building in Mykolaiv, according to the country’s State Emergency Service.

The service said in a post on Facebook that search and rescue work was continuing at the scene. Al Jazeera was unable to independently verify the figures provided.

Regional Governor Vitaliy Kim said in a post on Telegram that a Russian rocket had “destroyed half of the building”.

Russian forces have attacked Ukraine’s southern ports, including Kherson, Odesa, Mykolaiv and Mariupol, as part of an apparent attempt to cut Ukraine’s access to the Black Sea and establish a land corridor from Russia to Crimea, the peninsula Moscow seized in 2014.

Abramovich attends Istanbul talks

Photos posted on Telegram by Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency appear to show Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich in attendance at the talks in Istanbul.

It was not immediately clear what role he was playing at the meeting, though the Chelsea Football Club owner is believed to be operating as a broker between Kyiv and Moscow.

Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, was quoted by RIA Novosti as saying that Abramovich’s participation in the talks on Tuesday had been approved by Moscow and Kyiv.

A spokesman for the 55-year-old, who has been sanctioned by the UK over his alleged close ties with Putin, has previously said his influence in negotiations to date between the two sides had been “limited”.

Ukraine’s Kuleba warns negotiators not to ‘eat or drink’ at talks after poisoning reports

Ukraine’s foreign minister has advised members of the Ukrainian delegation “not to eat or drink anything, and preferably avoid touching any surface” during their negotiations with Russian officials in Istanbul.

Dmytro Kuleba’s comments, given during an interview with Ukrainian news channel Ukrayina 24, came after reports on Monday suggested Abramovich and Ukrainian negotiators had suffered symptoms of suspected poisoning earlier this month.

But there is some scepticism over the incident. Shortly after the reports emerged, an unnamed US official was quoted by Reuters as saying that intelligence suggested the trio’s symptoms were due to “environmental” factors, not poisoning.

Asia complying with Russia export controls: US

A senior US official says Washington has not seen any indications of non-compliance in Asia with export controls on Russia.

“We certainly haven’t seen any indication that there’s non-compliance, in fact, we’ve seen the reverse,” said Matthew Borman, a deputy assistant secretary at the commerce department. “I think there’s also a fair amount of additional self-sanctioning, if you will, by multinational companies operating in Russia,” he added.

Major players know there is a significant risk to their business if they don’t comply, Borman said.

“We know that Russia is quite dependent upon foreign supplies for some key inputs like semiconductors so I think it will be relatively readily apparent if there is non-compliance and the task will be to trace that back to its origin.”

Prospects for a ceasefire in Ukraine remain slim: Analyst

William Courtney, a former US ambassador to Georgia, says he sees no sign of Russian willingness to negotiate a ceasefire in Ukraine.

“Russia is worried that there’s not a perception of sufficient Russian bargaining strength. The international media are portraying Ukraine as holding off Russian forces. Some say Russia has begun to lose the war,” he told Al Jazeera.

“So Russia seems to now want to concentrate its forces in eastern Ukraine, where it has greater relative advantage and probably to try to get a victory somewhere to strengthen its hand in the negotiations. We’ve seen no sign on the battlefield that Russia is beginning to pull out troops, which might signify that it is willing to negotiate an agreement.

“For example, on this issue, Russia is still trying to pursue victory in all of Ukraine. It hasn’t given up on seizing Kyiv, and that had been its main aim up to now.”

“Now there are many hints and warnings that supposedly tougher sanctions, such as an embargo on Russian oil supplies to Europe, will be put in place if Russia uses chemical weapons,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address.

“Doesn’t everything the Russian military has done to date warrant an oil embargo? Don’t phosphorus bombs warrant it? A shelled chemical production facility or a shelled nuclear power plant doesn’t warrant it?

“If the sanctions packages are weak or do not work strongly enough, if they can be circumvented, it creates a dangerous illusion for the Russian leadership, as if they will be permitted to continue doing what they are doing now,” he said.

“Russia could try to block an understanding that brings the US and Iran back into compliance,” said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association.

5,99a2f7c3-1c08-4231-b480-3ca9819bcbb0,"['Nebi Qena', 'Associated Press', 'Yuras Karmanau']",2022-03-28 13:05:29-04:00,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — With its aspirations for a quick victory dashed by a stiff Ukrainian resistance, Russia has increasingly focused on grinding down Ukraine’s military in the east in the hope of forcing Kyiv into surrendering part of the country’s territory to possibly end the war.

The bulk of the Ukrainian army is concentrated in eastern Ukraine, where it has been locked up in fighting with Moscow-backed separatists in a nearly eight-year conflict. If Russia succeeds in encircling and destroying the Ukrainian forces in the country’s industrial heartland, called Donbas, it could try to dictate its terms to Kyiv and potentially attempt to split the country in two.

The Russian military declared Friday that the “first stage of the operation” had been largely accomplished, allowing Russian troops to concentrate on their “top goal — the liberation of Donbas.”

Many observers say the shift in strategy could reflect President Vladimir Putin’s acknowledgment that his plan for a blitz in Ukraine has failed, forcing him to narrow his goals and change tactics amid a disastrous war that has turned Russia into a pariah and decimated its economy.

In some sectors, Ukrainian troops have recently pushed the Russians back.

In the city of Makariv, near a strategic highway west of the capital, Kyiv, Associated Press reporters saw the carcass of a Russian rocket launcher, a burned Russian truck, the body of a Russian soldier and a destroyed Ukrainian tank after fighting there a few days ago. In the nearby village of Yasnohorodka, the AP witnessed positions abandoned by Ukrainian soldiers who had moved farther west, but no sign of Russian troops’ presence.

U.S. and British officials have noted that Moscow has increasingly focused on fighting the Ukrainian forces in the east while digging in around Kyiv and other big cities and pummeling them with rockets and artillery.

The chief of Ukrainian military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, said Sunday the change of focus could reflect Putin’s hope to break Ukraine in two, like North and South Korea, and enforce “a line of separation between the occupied and unoccupied regions.”

“He can’t swallow the entire country,” Budanov said, adding that Russia appears to be trying “to pull the occupied territories into a single quasi-state structure and pit it against independent Ukraine.”

Putin and his generals haven’t revealed specific military goals or a planned timeline, but the Kremlin clearly expected a quick victory when Russian troops rolled into Ukraine from the north, east and south on Feb. 24.

But the Russian attempts to swiftly capture Kyiv, the country’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, and other big cities in the northeast have been thwarted by well-organized Ukrainian defenses and logistical challenges that stalled the Russian offensive.

Russian forces have pounded the outskirts of Kyiv with artillery and air raids from a distance while putting their ground offensive on hold, tactics they also have used in attacking Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Sumy in the northeast.

Mykola Sunhurovskyi, a military analyst at the Kyiv-based Razumkov Center think tank, said Russia has abandoned attempts to storm Kyiv and other big Ukrainian cities for now and is laying siege to them to try to weaken Ukraine and win time.

“Russia has shifted tactics … to redistribute its forces and prepare for the next active stage of the war,” Sunhurovskyi said.

The Russian forces encircled the key strategic port of Mariupol and besieged it for weeks, hammering it with rockets and artillery in a carnage that killed thousands of civilians. The fall of Mariupol would free up Russian forces there and allow them to engage in a potential pincer movement together with another group of troops moving from Kharkiv in the northeast to try to encircle the Ukrainian military in the east.

“Russian forces appear to be concentrating their effort to attempt the encirclement of Ukrainian forces directly facing the separatist regions in the east of the country, advancing from the direction of Kharkiv in the north and Mariupol in the south,” the British Ministry of Defense said Sunday.

A senior U.S. defense official, noting the latest Russian focus on Donbas, said Putin may now hope to take full control of the east while keeping other Ukrainian forces occupied with the defense of Kyiv and other areas, then try to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to formally surrender Donbas and recognize Russia’s ownership of Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014.

An analysis published Saturday by the Institute for the Study of War in Washington said the degree to which the Russians can push an accelerated move to cut off Donbas will depend in part on how soon their forces can gain full control of Mariupol and how badly damaged they emerge from that fight. It also noted that a halt in the Russian offensive on Kyiv could reflect “the incapacity of Russian forces rather than any shift in Russian objectives or efforts at this time.”

While the Russian military has focused increasingly on bleeding the Ukrainian troops in the east, it has continued to use its arsenal of air- and sea-launched cruise missiles to methodically target fuel depots, military arsenals and weapons plants across the country.

Philips P. O’Brien, a professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews, described Saturday’s cruise missile strikes on Lviv, near the border with Poland, as part of the Russian strategy to cut off supplies to the Ukrainian forces fighting in the east.

“They will still want to disrupt as much as possible the flow of goods and supplies from west to east, much of which starts their journey around Lviv,” O’Brien said.

On the Black Sea coast, the Russians quickly took the port of Kherson and advanced to the outskirts of the key shipbuilding center of Mykolaiv where their offensive stalled.

If the Russian forces succeed in encircling Mykolaiv, Odesa and several other Black Sea ports, it will have completely cut Ukraine’s access to its coast in a devastating blow to its economy. The seizure of Odesa will also allow Moscow to establish a link to the separatist Trans-Dniester region of Moldova that hosts a Russian military base.

Despite Ukrainian and Western fears, the Russian army so far hasn’t pursued efforts to bypass Mykolaiv and march on Odesa. Ukrainian authorities have noted that Russia’s failure to press its offensive along the coast could be explained by the fact that most of its troops in the south have remained locked in the battle for Mariupol where they have suffered heavy losses.

On Friday, the Russian military reported it had lost 1,351 soldiers killed and 3,825 wounded since the start of the campaign, but NATO estimates 7,000 to 15,000 have been killed — potentially as many as the Soviet Union lost in the entire 10-year war in Afghanistan.

The big losses and slow pace of the Russian offensive could be a factor that forced Putin to lower his ambitions and take a more realistic approach.

Volodymyr Fesenko, the head of the independent Kyiv-based Penta Center, said Russia’s declared shift to the east could be an attempt to put a good face on its failed blitz and regroup before the next stage of fighting.

“Both sides need a break now for various reasons, and the Kremlin is using it to regroup its forces and search for new tactics without changing its strategic goal of subduing Ukraine,” Fesenko told the AP.

“Tactics could change from a blitz to laying siege to cities, destroying the economy and the infrastructure with bombardment, blockading ports and doing other things. Putin has a broad arsenal of means of pressure.”

“The stiff Ukrainian resistance could turn the war into a protracted conflict, and then the issue of financial and military resources, including warplanes and tanks Zelensky is urging the West to provide will be of primary importance,” he said.

It's been nearly five weeks since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Following negotiations yesterday Russia announced it was going to drastically reduce military combat operations in the areas around the capital Kyiv and northern city of Chernihiv.

But this was met with scepticism by the Ukrainians as well as the US and UK, who said it should be treated with caution.

Military assessment

The UK's military intelligence says Russia is focusing on eastern regions because of its military struggles, with some units which have suffered heavy losses returning to Russia and Belarus (to Ukraine's north) to resupply and re-organise.

The Institute for the Study of War says Russian forces have given up on seizing Kyiv but that they continue to fight to hold their current position near the city. Russia is also directing some reserves in an effort to gain ground that will link Kharkiv with its front line in Luhansk. And it says Mariupol is likely to fall within days.

On the ground

The Ukrainian governor in Donetsk says there has been Russian shelling along all the cities and towns on the front line that separates the two sides. Shelling is also reported in the Luhansk region.

Despite Russia's pledge yesterday, Chernihiv regional governor VIacheslav Chaus claims Russian forces carried out strikes on the city ""all night long"" while the sound of artillery could be heard on the edge of Kyiv city centre.

What next?

Russia says it wants to focus on ""liberating"" the eastern Donbas region (home to Donetsk and Luhansk) and it appears this is where its forces will now focus.

Russian troops are likely to want to create a land corridor along the south coast, linking Crimea with the Russian border. Mariupol, which sits along that route, is strategically important, which is why Russia has been bombing it so heavily, killing large numbers of civilians and creating a humanitarian crisis.",https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-60923158/page/8
7,99a2f7c3-1c08-4231-b480-3ca9819bcbb0,"['Nebi Qena', 'Yuras Karmanau']",,"KYIV, Ukraine — With its aspirations for a quick victory dashed by a stiff Ukrainian resistance, Russia has increasingly focused on grinding down Ukraine’s military in the east in the hope of forcing Kyiv into surrendering part of the country’s territory to possibly end the war.

The bulk of the Ukrainian army is concentrated in eastern Ukraine, where it has been locked up in fighting with Moscow-backed separatists in a nearly eight-year conflict. If Russia succeeds in encircling and destroying the Ukrainian forces in the country’s industrial heartland called Donbas, it could try to dictate its terms to Kyiv and, possibly, attempt to split the country in two.

The Russian military declared Friday that the “first stage of the operation” had been largely accomplished, allowing Russian troops to concentrate on their “top goal — the liberation of Donbas.”

Many observers say the shift in strategy could reflect President Vladimir Putin’s acknowledgment that his plan for a blitz in Ukraine has failed, forcing him to narrow his goals and change tactics amid a disastrous war that has turned Russia into a pariah and decimated its economy.
