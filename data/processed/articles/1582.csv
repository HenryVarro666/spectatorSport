The Pentagon believes Russia is flying about 200 sorties every day, although many never enter Ukrainian air space.

The Russians can fire cruise missles from planes on the Russia side of the border without risking a strike by Ukraine's air defenses.

Ukraine still has about 56 operational jets flying five to 10 hours every day, according senior US defense official.

The Pentagon says some Russian jets are avoiding Ukrainian airspace, apparently to avoid being shot down by Ukraine's air defense systems.

During a background briefing with reporters, a senior US defense official said the Pentagon assesses that Russia is flying about 200 sorties every day but some never enter Ukraine's air space. Instead, the Russians are able to fire aerial-mounted cruise missiles at Ukraine from planes on the Russian side of the border.

It was widely assumed by defense analysts that Russia would quickly gain air superiority during its invasion of Ukraine, but Russia's Aerospace Forces have played little role as the ground forces have struggled to take major cities in the face of stalwart Ukraine fighters.

Many observers were expecting Russian bombers to knock out Ukraine's radar installations and surface-to-air missile batteries, leaving air superiority fighters like the Su-35 to attack Ukraine's aircraft as it moved its own SAM systems into Ukraine. But Russia failed to do so and Ukraine's smaller air force and its missiles have downed Russian planes.

Similarly, Russia's fleet of combat helicopters has largely gone unusued, another signal that Russian commanders are aware of the risks posed by air defenses and increasingly shoulder-fired missiles like the Stingers the US is sending.

In the first days of the war in Ukraine, researchers at Oryx — a blog that tracks military equipment losses through open-source data — found that Russia lost a number of combat jets to Ukraine's defense systems.

The skirting of Ukrainian air space suggests Russia warplanes are aware of these still considerable dangers.

Story continues

In an interview on Wednesday, an expert on the Russian military said he's seeing signs that its air force is ""risk averse"" and said there's still debate as to why.

""Maybe they're saving their aircraft in case this conflict goes wider,"" said Jeffrey Edmonds, an expert on the Russian military with the Arlington, Va.-based research organization CNA.

The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist.

Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters on Friday:

Russia flying 20 times as many sorties as Ukraine

Russian military planes are flying an average of 200 sorties per day, compared to only about 10 per day flown by Ukraine, according to the official.

Much of the airspace above Ukraine is heavily guarded by both Ukrainian and Russian surface-to-air missiles, making air operations risky for both sides.

But Russian aircraft don't have to enter Ukrainian airspace to do damage.

""You can launch cruise missiles from aircraft from a great distance away. And if your target is relatively close, you don't need to enter the airspace,"" the official said.

For the first time, the official gave details on the total number of functioning Ukrainian fighter jets and how much they're being used.

""They have 56 available to them now, fully operational, and they're only flying them five to 10 hours a day,"" the official said.

Ukraine needs drones, not jets: Official

Noting Russia's vast umbrella of anti-aircraft capability over Ukraine and its larger air force, the official repeated some of the arguments we heard from the Pentagon earlier this week about the relative ineffectiveness of sending more aircraft to Ukraine.

""It makes little sense to us that additional fixed-wing aircraft is going to have somehow solve all these problems. What they need are surface-to-air missile systems, they need MANPADS, they need anti-armor, and they need small arms and ammunition, and they need these drones, because that's what they're using with great effect. And so, that's what we're focused on,"" the official said.

Ukrainian forces are making ""terrific"" use of drones, especially against Russian ground movements, according to the official. The drones can be also used both for reconnaissance and surveillance.

""They're trained on how to use them, they can fly below radar coverage by the Russians,"" the official said.

They are also much cheaper than fighter aircraft, and being unmanned, don't risk pilots being killed or captured.

Chemical weapons and false flags

The official said that despite claims from China and Russia, the U.S. is not helping Ukraine create or use any chemical or biological weapons.

""This is bio research with regard to two things: One, helping Ukraine over the years decrease the pathogen inventory that they had under Soviet years, and then to develop strategies to defeat pathogens going forward,"" the official said. ""It's scientific research, it's not bio-weapons capabilities.""

The official said the U.S. has nothing to hide, and that information on its role in scientific work in Ukraine was already publicly available.

""The only reason why we elevated the discussion is because the Russians and the Chinese decided to lie about it -- just flat out lie,"" the official said.

The official would not offer any U.S. intelligence assessment of the likelihood of Russian President Vladimir Putin deploying chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine.

""We know that the Russians have had -- and we assess that they still have -- a sophisticated chemical and biological weapons program. I'm not going to talk about intelligence assessments about what they may do with that program or what, if any, designs they might have on Ukraine in that regard,"" the official said.

The official said Russia's ""ridiculous narrative"" could possibly ""be building a pretext for some sort of false flag event.""

State of the invasion

The push to Kyiv: Russians have not moved any closer to Kyiv from the northwest since yesterday, still approximately 9 miles from city center. But the U.S. has seen rear elements move up closer to those advance troops. Russians advancing on the capital from northeast now 12-19 miles out.

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters Friday that the Russians coming from the east, while further from Kyiv, are gaining more ground than those to the northwest near the Hostomel Airport.

""We do assess that the Russians are beginning to make more momentum on the ground towards Kyiv, particularly from the east, not quite so much from the north,"" Kirby said.

Kharkiv: Russians are ""closing in,"" but the city is well defended and hasn't been taken yet.

Mariupol: The port city is under increasing pressure today. It is surrounded from northeast and southwest, under heavy bombardment, but Ukrainians are fighting back there.

Kherson: The city remains under Russian control: ""We continue to assess that they have Kherson,"" the official said.

Mykolayiv: Russian forces remain to the northeast of the city, though it is under increasing pressure. ""We've observed the Ukrainians are continuing to defend the city, and the Russians are just outside the city,"" the official said.

Lutsk and Ivano-Frankovsk: The Russians struck airfields in each city Friday.

""Obviously, they wanted to eliminate the Ukrainians' ability to use these airfields,"" the official said.

The official did not know how much the Ukrainians were using these two airfields or how extensive the damage was.

""What's unusual about it is that [the Russians] haven't been striking in western Ukraine,"" the official said of the strikes.

Russian missile strikes

The Russians have now launched nearly 810 missiles against Ukraine -- almost half have been fired from within Ukraine using mobile platforms. The rest have been fired from Russia, Belarus, and a small number from the Black Sea. This is up from an estimate of 775 missiles offered by the official Thursday.

Majority of combat power intact

Russia still has roughly 90% of its invading combat power still viable, with Ukraine falling just under 90%, the official said.",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ukraine-drones-great-effect-russian-forces-pentagon-updates/story?id=83391603

The disinformation battle remains active with the continuing claims about chemical/biological threats. Russia’s military reports read in a more perfunctory way the materiel captured with the differences in numbers notable. “They've got roughly 200,000 troops now, to occupy a country which is as large as France… They don’t have the forces.” It begins to resemble the 2003 Iraq war, complete with WMD claims and counter-claims. These are message diversions not unlike the MiG-29 transfers, while the reality is that Ukraine’s air defense is being augmented from NATO including S-300 surface-to-air missile systems.

Ukrainian resistance continues to be ""stiff and determined,"" a senior defense official said today at a Pentagon press briefing.

x A Friday background briefing at the Pentagon about the war on Ukraine has concluded.



Some notable details ahead: — Dan Lamothe (@DanLamothe) March 11, 2022



The first explores the scenario under which Americans are going to join the Ukrainian war effort:

washingtonpost.com/national-secur… First, going to flag two stories I'm involved in that we published this morning.The first explores the scenario under which Americans are going to join the Ukrainian war effort:



washingtonpost.com/national-secur… The second details Russian military losses to the extent we can, and what it all means:

On to the briefing. No major changes on battlefield. Mariupol and other major cities are getting pummeled. Fierce ground fighting in several areas, too.

On Thursday, the Pentagon indicated the long-stalled Russian ground convoy north of Kyiv had moved from about 12 miles outside the city center to nine miles away.

No change to that Friday, though there is some movement within the column.

New nugget from Pentagon: A senior U.S. defense official says today that some vehicles in the stalled Russian convoy north of Kyiv have been pulled off the road and into tree lines, an effort to disguise them and hide them from attack.

In light of questions around chemical-biological issues in Ukraine, senior U.S. defense official says the Pentagon has not sent protective gear for that to the Ukrainians. Also not aware of a request for it.

The senior U.S. defense official said Ukraine still has 56 operational jets in its arsenal and has been flying them just five to 10 hours per day. Points to that as one reason the Polish proposal to send Polish MiG-29 jets to Ukraine by way of the U.S. government was scuttled.

The Russian military, by comparison, has been flying about 200 sorties per day, senior U.S. defense official says. Some do not cross into Ukraine, he added, noting the Russians can fire aerial-mounted cruise missiles from planes at Ukraine from the Russian side of the border.

As of Friday, the Pentagon assesses that Russia has launched “nearly 810” missiles at Ukraine since invasion day. “The majority, nearly 400 of these missile strikes,” have been launched from Russian launchers in Ukraine.

Russia still has about 90 percent of the combat power it had arrayed at the Ukrainian border prior to invasion available to them for use, senior U.S. defense official says, indicating thousands of soldiers are dead, wounded or captured.

Ukraine has “a tad more” than 90 percent of its combat forces available, same U.S. defense official says. Important note: Its military is significantly smaller.

Pentagon is aware of Russian rhetoric that they want to recruit 16K foreign fighters from the Middle East to fight in Ukraine. Some efforts are being made in Syria, but it’s unclear if recruiting goes beyond Syria or if they are having success, senior U.S. defense official says.

No additional weapons systems to announce going to Ukraine. Arms deliveries to the Ukrainians continue, defense official says.

@PentagonPresSec is expected to brief on the record shortly. It'll be streamed here. I'm not threading it. Need to write now and it's more widely available than the backgrounder.

British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace told Parliament on Wednesday that Russia had nearly twice the number of battalion tactical groups at its disposal than did Ukraine when the war began, and that air superiority tilted the balance even further toward an “overwhelming” Russian advantage. But Wallace said nearly all of Moscow’s objectives in Ukraine have remained unfulfilled.

The past two weeks have shown that just because Russia has the tools of war, that does not mean commanders know how to effectively use them.

François Heisbourg, a French political analyst who used to advise President Emmanuel Macron on national security, said the Russian advances have been strikingly limited.

“They’ve only taken one regional capital out of the 26 which were free of Russian influence before Feb. 25,” Heisbourg said.

And with a fight looming against dug-in Ukrainian troops in each of the cities that remain, it is unclear whether Russia has the capacity — or the will — to succeed.

“The logistics are pathetic. The soldiers are definitely not motivated,” he said. “It’s not what you would call a steady advance. There is actually very little terrain occupied.”

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

President Biden strongly condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine during his annual State of the Union address on Tuesday. Here are some excerpts from his prepared remarks, as released by the White House.

PRESIDENT BIDEN: Six days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world, thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated.

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined.

He met the Ukrainian people.

From President Zelensky to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world.

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

In this struggle as President Zelensky said in his speech to the European Parliament, “Light will win over darkness.” The Ukrainian ambassador to the United States is here tonight.

Let each of us here tonight in this chamber send an unmistakable signal to Ukraine and to the world.

Please rise if you are able and show that, yes, we the United States of America stand with the Ukrainian people.

Throughout our history we’ve learned this lesson when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression they cause more chaos.

They keep moving.

And the costs and the threats to America and the world keep rising.

That’s why the NATO Alliance was created to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War II.

The United States is a member along with 29 other nations.

It matters. American diplomacy matters. American resolve matters.

Putin’s latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and unprovoked.

He rejected repeated efforts at diplomacy.

He thought the West and NATO wouldn’t respond. And he thought he could divide us at home. Putin was wrong. We were ready. Here is what we did.

We prepared extensively and carefully.

We spent months building a coalition of other freedom-loving nations from Europe and the Americas to Asia and Africa to confront Putin.

I spent countless hours unifying our European allies. We shared with the world in advance what we knew Putin was planning and precisely how he would try to falsely justify his aggression.

We countered Russia’s lies with truth.

And now that he has acted, the free world is holding him accountable.

Along with 27 members of the European Union, including France, Germany, Italy, as well as countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and many others, even Switzerland.

We are inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine. Putin is now isolated from the world more than ever.

Together with our allies — we are right now enforcing powerful economic sanctions.

We are cutting off Russia’s largest banks from the international financial system. Preventing Russia’s central bank from defending the Russian ruble, making Putin’s $630 Billion “war fund” worthless.

We are choking off Russia’s access to technology that will sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come.

Tonight, I say to the Russian oligarchs and corrupt leaders who have bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime, “No more.”

The U.S. Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs.

We are joining with our European allies to find and seize their yachts their luxury apartments their private jets. We are coming for your ill-begotten gains.

And tonight I am announcing that we will join our allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights, further isolating Russia and adding an additional squeeze on their economy. He has no idea what’s coming.

The Ruble has lost 30 percent of its value.

The Russian stock market has lost 40 percent of its value, and trading remains suspended. The Russian economy is reeling, and Putin alone is to blame.

Together with our allies, we are providing support to the Ukrainians in their fight for freedom. Military assistance. Economic assistance. Humanitarian assistance.

We are giving more than $1 billion in direct assistance to Ukraine, and will continue to aid the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and help ease their suffering.

But let me be clear: Our forces are not engaged and will not engage in conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine.

Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO Allies — in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west.

For that purpose we’ve mobilized American ground forces, air squadrons, and ship deployments to protect NATO countries including Poland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia.

As I have made crystal clear: The United States and our allies will defend every inch of territory of NATO countries with the full force of our collective power. Every single inch.

And we remain cleareyed. The Ukrainians are fighting back with pure courage. But the next few days, weeks and months will be hard on them.

Putin has unleashed violence and chaos. But while he may make gains on the battlefield, he will pay a continuing high price over the long run.

And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backward.

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I always promised I would be. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world.

And I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers.

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming.

But I want you to know that we are going to be OK.

When the history of this era is written, Putin’s war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.

While it shouldn’t have taken something so terrible for people around the world to see what’s at stake, now everyone sees it clearly.

We see the unity among leaders of nations, a more unified Europe a more unified West. And we see unity among the people who are gathering in cities in large crowds around the world even in Russia to demonstrate their support for the people of Ukraine.

In the battle between democracy and autocracy, democracies are rising to the moment, and the world is clearly choosing the side of peace and security.

This is a real test. It’s going to take time. So let us continue to draw inspiration from the iron will of the Ukrainian people.

To our fellow Ukrainian Americans who forge a deep bond that connects our two nations we stand with you.

Putin may circle Kyiv with tanks, but he will never gain the hearts and souls of the Ukrainian people.

He will never extinguish their love of freedom. He will never weaken the resolve of the free world.",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/03/01/world/ukraine-russia-war
