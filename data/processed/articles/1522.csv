Kyrylenko said 109 people were wounded in the attack, which Ukraine has blamed on Russia.

Around 800 people descended on the German city of Frankfurt on Sunday amid a sea of Russian flags to protest against the “hatred and harassment” they say they have suffered since the start of the war in Ukraine.

Germany is home to 1.2 million people of Russian origin and 325,000 from Ukraine. Authorities fear the conflict could be imported into Germany and the protests used to promote Moscow’s war narrative.

Police have so far recorded 383 anti-Russian offences and 181 anti-Ukrainian offences since the Kremlin’s invasion started on February 24.

6:50pm: Chernobyl situation far from normal, IAEA says

Ukraine has informed the International Atomic Energy Agency that the staff at its decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant has been rotated for the first time in three weeks after Russian troops left the area.

It said the situation remains far from normal, however, and that the staff had to be transported to and from the site by water, with the Pripyat River being the only way for people living in the city of Slavutych to currently reach the plant.

The IAEA said it had been informed that analytical laboratories for radiation monitoring at the site were destroyed, with analytical instruments “stolen, broken or otherwise disabled"". The automated transmission of radiation monitoring data has been disabled.

Biden will use the talks to continue “close consultations on the consequences of Russia’s brutal war against Ukraine and mitigating its destabilising impact on global food supply and commodity markets"", his spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, said in a statement Sunday.

India has so far refused to join the votes condemning Moscow at the United Nations General Assembly, while saying it was deeply disturbed by the alleged killings of civilians by Russian troops in the town of Bucha in Ukraine.

According to experts, Russia is India’s biggest supplier of major arms and India is Russia’s largest customer.

Ukraine’s prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova on Sunday told Britain’s Sky News that “we have actually now, only for this morning, 1,222 dead people only in Kyiv region”.

Russian forces fired rockets into Ukraine’s Luhansk and Dnipro regions on Sunday, Ukrainian officials said, completely destroying an airport and potentially leaving casualties.

Washington commits to providing weapons to Ukraine

World Bank forecasts 45% drop in Ukraine GDP output

KYIV/BUZOVA, Ukraine, April 10 (Reuters) - Russian forces pounded targets in eastern Ukraine with missiles and artillery on Sunday as Austria's leader planned to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Washington pledged to give Ukraine ""the weapons it needs"" to defend itself against a new Russian offensive.

Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said he would meet with Putin on Monday in Moscow for the Russian leader's first face-to-face meeting with a European Union counterpart since Russia's invasion began on Feb. 24. read more

""We are militarily neutral, but (have) a clear position on the Russian war of aggression against #Ukraine,"" Nehammer wrote of Austria on Twitter. ""It must stop! It needs humanitarian corridors, ceasefire & full investigation of war crimes.""

Nehammer met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv on Saturday - the same day as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who promised to give Ukraine 120 armoured vehicles and anti-ship missile systems.

Russia has failed to take any major cities, but Ukraine says it has been gathering its forces in the east for a major assault and has urged people to flee.

Russian forces fired rockets into Ukraine's Luhansk and Dnipropetrovsk regions on Sunday, officials said. Missiles completely destroyed the airport in the city of Dnipro, said Valentyn Reznichenko, governor of the central Dnipropetrovsk region.

Russia's defence ministry said high-precision missiles had destroyed the headquarters of Ukraine's Dnipro battalion in the town of Zvonetsky. read more

Reuters could not immediately confirm the reports.

WEAPONS APPEALS

Since Russia invaded, Zelenskiy has appealed to Western powers to provide more defence help, and to punish Moscow with tougher sanctions, including embargoes on Russian energy exports.

U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan told ABC News: ""We're going to get Ukraine the weapons it needs to beat back the Russians to stop them from taking more cities and towns."" read more

In an interview aired on CBS's ""60 Minutes,"" Zelenskiy said he had confidence in his own armed forces but ""unfortunately I don't have the confidence that we will be receiving everything we need"" from the United States.

""They have to supply weapons to Ukraine as if they were defending themselves and their own people,"" Zelenskiy added. ""They need to understand this. If they don’t speed up, it will be very hard for us to hold on against this pressure.""

Zelenskiy said earlier on Twitter he had spoken on the phone with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz about additional sanctions, as well as more defence and financial support for his country. Zelenskiy also discussed with Ukrainian officials Kyiv's proposals for a new package of EU sanctions, his office said.

The EU on Friday banned Russian coal imports among other products, but has yet to touch oil and gas imports from Russia. read more

NEW SANCTIONS

Mounting civilian casualties have triggered widespread international condemnation and new sanctions.

A grave with at least two civilian bodies has been found in Buzova village near Kyiv, said Taras Didych, head of the Dmytrivka community that includes Buzova, the latest such reported discovery since Russian forces withdrew from areas north of the capital.

Sullivan said on Sunday he expected Russia's newly appointed general overseeing Ukraine, Aleksandr Dvornikov, to authorise more brutality against the Ukrainian civilian population. He did not cite any evidence. read more

Moscow has rejected accusations of war crimes by Ukraine and Western countries.

Moscow has repeatedly denied targeting civilians in what it calls a ""special operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" its southern neighbour. Ukraine and Western nations have dismissed this as a baseless pretext for war.

Russia's invasion has forced about a quarter of Ukraine's 44 million people from their homes, turned cities into rubble and killed or injured thousands.

The World Bank on Sunday forecast the war would cause Ukraine's economic output to collapse by a staggering 45% this year, with half of its businesses shuttered, grain exports mostly cut off by Russia's naval blockade and destruction rendering economic activity impossible in many areas. read more

The bank forecast Russia's GDP would contract by 11.2% this year due to punishing Western sanctions.

HEAVY SHELLING

Some cities in Ukraine's east were under heavy shelling, with tens of thousands of people unable to evacuate.

Calls by Ukrainian officials for civilians to flee gained more urgency after a missile strike hit a train station on Friday in the city of Kramatorsk, in the Donetsk region, that was full of people trying to leave.

Ukrainian officials said on Sunday the death toll from the strike rose to 57, while 109 were wounded. Russia has denied responsibility, saying the missiles used in the attack were only used by Ukraine's military.

Reuters was unable to verify the details of the attack.

Ramzan Kadyrov, the powerful head of Russia's Chechnya region, said in a video message that Russia would unleash an offensive on the besieged port of Mariupol, but also Luhansk, and Donetsk and then target Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities. read more

Ukraine's deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said 2,824 people were evacuated on Sunday through humanitarian corridors, including 213 from Mariupol, which has been under siege for weeks.

Russia launched Kalibr cruise missiles on Sunday against four S-300 launchers which were concealed in a hangar on the outskirts of the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, the defence ministry said.

Russia said 25 Ukrainian troops were hit in the attack.

""High-precision sea-launched Kalibr missiles destroyed the equipment of a S-300 anti-aircraft missile division which had been delivered to the Kyiv regime by a European country,"" the ministry said.

Russia did not say which European country had supplied the S-300 systems.

NATO member Slovakia, which had donated such a missile system to Ukraine, said the one it supplied had not been hit.

""Our S-300 was not destroyed,"" Slovak government spokesperson Lubica Janikova said.

Russian forces also shot down two Ukrainian Su-25 aircraft near the city of Izium and destroyed two ammunition depots, one of which was near the southern city of Mykolaiv, the Russian defence ministry said.

The Ukrainian military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Editor’s note: This post contains descriptions that may be upsetting.

Cleaning crews have arrived at the railway station in Kramatorsk, eastern Ukraine, where dozens of Ukrainians were killed by a Russian missile strike on Friday while waiting to flee fighting.

CNN saw workers wearing plastic gloves gather scattered human remains. Others looked through papers and documents that were strewn across the station. Plastic bags filled with food lay on the ground, alongside shredded hats, gloves and shoes.

Several points of impact from the strike were visible, including what appeared to have been a direct hit on a car. Pools of blood and a deceased dog, partially covered by white sheeting, lay by the tracks.

At least 50 people, including five children, were killed in the attack, Ukrainian officials said Friday, with dozens more taken to local hospitals.

The remains of the missile were picked up and transported by specialists.

On the station concourse, a pile of abandoned luggage sat unattended. Meanwhile, the streets of Kramatorsk -- a city of more than 150,000 inhabitants -- appeared deserted on Sunday.

At the city's bus station, dozens of people were waiting to get out of the city. Buses are running to Sloviansk, towards the north, where trains are still operating.

A volunteer, Nikolai, said he had been helping with evacuations since the war began. “I was happy when I heard Russians were leaving the area around Kyiv, but then I saw they are coming to Donbas. I’m very worried,” he said.

Residents of Sloviansk have been leaving the city in recent days after local officials warned of a Russian offensive approaching from Izium.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the strike in Kramatorsk a war crime in a message on Friday, and said it would be investigated in detail.

“This is another war crime of Russia, for which everyone involved will be held accountable,” he said, adding that Russian state propaganda had tried to blame Ukrainian armed forces for the attack.

“We expect a firm, global response to this war crime,” Zelensky said. “Like the massacres in Bucha, as well as many other Russian war crimes, the missile strike on Kramatorsk must be one of the charges at the tribunal, which is bound to happen.""

Some context: Russia's military and senior officials have issued blanket denials of attacks against civilians, including claiming -- without evidence -- that the massacre of civilians in Bucha was staged. The killing of civilians during the Russian occupation of the town has been extensively documented.",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-04-10-22/h_34ba773ae6d7b68ac994adec66a4c072
