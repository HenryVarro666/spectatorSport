This night, Russian troops shelled Kharkiv and fired rockets at the city of Lozova in the Kharkiv region, attacked settlements in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, fired artillery at the Kherson region, which needs humanitarian aid and evacuation.

Source: data of regional heads as of 8 am on 7 April

Details:

Kharkiv: at night Russian invaders fired again on residential areas of the city. Missile strikes were conducted on the city of Lozova, no one was injured. The ‚Äã‚Äãevacuation of civilians is ongoing from Lozova and the town of Barvinkovo.

Luhansk region: Russian troops did not succeed in entering the settlement of Novotoshkivske. They are firing at the town of Hirske with all kinds of weapons.

The roof of the Severodonetsk hospital and residential buildings in the city of Lysychansk caught fire. Some houses in Lysychansk, as well as farm buildings in Lysychansk, Severodonetsk, Novodruzhesk and Toshkivka have been destroyed.

At night, firefighters headed off a catastrophe by putting out a fire on the roof of a hospital in Severodonetsk. The fire spread to at least 10 high-rise buildings, engulfing them in flames, and many other high-rise buildings had windows broken and roofs damaged.

Donetsk region: the town of Maryinka and the village of Novomykhailivka came under attack from Russian artillery and aircraft.

The city of Avdiivka, Ocheretyne district and Toretsk district were shelled. The extent of the destruction and the number of people affected by the Russian attacks is being established.

No changes in Mariupol. It is under blockade. Resistance continues.

In the last 24 hours in the Kherson region there were many explosions, Russian occupiers have used ""Grad"" multiple rocket launchers. There are reports of destroyed houses and schools, and also of casualties (detailed information is being clarified).

According to the authorities, people are trying to leave the occupied villages by their own means.

""The region needs humanitarian aid and evacuation of civilians, in particular, Beryslav district and villages on the border with Mykolayiv region,"" the Kherson Military State Administration emphasises.

Prior to the Russian retreat from the Kyiv area, on March 23, I posted this image from NASA‚Äôs FIRMS satellite service, normally used to track forest fires but also great for tracking a war‚Äôs front lines.

At the time, it was well-known that there was heavy fighting immediately west and northwest of Kyiv‚ÄîIrpin, Bucha, and Hostomel at the front line. But I marveled at that entire line of fire all the way up to the Belarus border. There was zero information on fighting in that area, yet FIRMS imagery was very clear that something was going on, so I confidently stated that ‚ÄúRussia‚Äôs entire NW army is under severe assault.‚Äù

As Russia withdrew, the world saw Russia‚Äôs brutality exposed. But in addition to the war crimes, we also saw hundreds of destroyed Russian vehicles, all the way up that front. For a battle that had been fought mostly in that Bucha-Irpin front, that seemed odd. Now, it‚Äôs not so odd, seeing this Ukrainian artillery assault that took place before the Russian retreat:

The target has been geolocated to here:

If you compare it to the FIRMS map above, you‚Äôll see that this attack was firmly along that band of fire, the first evidence we have that Ukraine was pushing hard against that entire Russian front from the west. Remember, depending on the artillery system, we‚Äôre talking ranges of 9 to 20 miles. So, well outside the range of any artillery Ukraine had in Kyiv and its environs. That artillery had to be much closer to the point of attack, and Ukraine wouldn‚Äôt be deploying artillery without proper defenses, as a typical artillery battery lacks defensive capabilities and would be easily overrun in a direct assault. That means that artillery was in support of an entire army pushing along Russia‚Äôs western flank. The FIRMS map really did tell us something that Ukraine‚Äôs general staff didn‚Äôt want to openly discuss.

No wonder Russia pulled their forces out. It had nothing to do with the stalemate near Kyiv. Those Russian forces were in real danger of being fully wiped out via a poorly protected western flank. Russia lost that entire axis on the battlefield.

So what does FIRMS tells us today? A lot, actually.

There‚Äôs a red dot at Kramatorsk, which is Russia‚Äôs latest war crime. The Donbas front is on fire, as it has been from Day One. Kharkiv is getting shelled, but not the city proper‚Äînorth, east, and northeast of it. We know Ukraine has been pushing Russian forces back along that entire line, and even threatening Russian supply lines to Izyum to the east of Kharkiv. So it‚Äôs either Russian shelling the counter-attacking Ukrainians, Ukrainian strikes on Russian forces, or, most likely, both.

Then there‚Äôs Mariupol. Oh, Mariupol, which should have fallen on the first day of the war but continues to hold out. I‚Äôm going to save the story of Mariupol for the next update‚Äîit‚Äôs quite simply unbelievable.

Interestingly, Kherson looks quiet on FIRMS, but we know that‚Äôs not the case. It just means that the fighting, in small towns over barren, open, desert-like terrain isn‚Äôt leaving burning vehicles and structures behind for the FIRMS satellite to capture. Also, it‚Äôs raining, which presumably snuffs out any such fires. As of now, there are now reports of Ukrainian forces within 5 km west of Kherson.

Let me introduce you guys to the latest and greatest open-source intelligence project‚ÄîUAWarData, which tracks the movement of individual Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs). You can even toggle the time slider to get a sense of their movement over time. Note that it‚Äôs open-source, based on enthusiasts poring over Ukrainian general staff reports and geolocated photos, so it‚Äôs more of an educated guess than precision data. Also, there‚Äôs really no way to tell how degraded a particular BTG might be from battlefield attrition.

All those caveats aside, what‚Äôs striking about the Russian presence around Kherson is that there only appear to be around six BTGs available, each with approximately 600 to 1,000 troops. Russia has no reinforcements to send, as all spare bodies are being thrown into the Donbas. Kherson was held by ‚Äúelite‚Äù Russian Airborne Forces (VDV) troops, Spetsnaz special operations forces, and elements of the 20th Guards Motorized Rifle Division (GMRD) and a smattering of other units. At full strength, that would be around 6,000 soldiers. But these are the units that tried to go up to Mykolaiv and eventually got spanked at Voznesenks, officially turning the tide of this war. These units are nowhere near full strength. In fact, Ukraine general staff claims the 20th GMRD was degraded 40% and was recently withdrawn back to Russia.

Presumably, that means that all that‚Äôs left inside Kherson are a few thousand airborne and special forces types‚Äîlight infantry with some artillery support, but little in the way of armor. They could try and hold the city, but with an angry and restless populace, they‚Äôd have few places to hide, and hostiles inside and outside the city to deal with. While Russian offensives outside of Kherson suggest they‚Äôre not giving the city up without a fight, the lack of heavy forces (read: armor) inside the city means they‚Äôre ready for a quick and nimble retreat if necessary, blowing that famous Kherson bridge to cover their retreat south.

Given the failure to move on Odesa, there is little strategic value to Kherson left. The source of Crimea‚Äôs water supply, the North Crimean Canal and a legitimate strategic concern, is further east, and on the south side of the Dnipro river‚Äîeasy to defend by blowing all bridges.

In fact, if Russia blows all the bridges, Ukraine has no way to cross the Dnipro River south of Kherson without building entirely new massive bridges (which would be immediately destroyed by Russia). The river is too wide for all but the most complex military pontoon bridges, even if Ukraine had them, which they don‚Äôt. (You can see how wide it is here, during one of the early battles for the bridge.)

Unable to cross the Dnipro, Ukrainian forces around Kherson can‚Äôt get to Melitopol. Russian control of all that territory south and easy of the river is protected. So why waste men and material trying to defend Kherson?",https://www.dailykos.com/story/2022/4/8/2090834/-Ukraine-update-The-Battle-of-Kyiv-was-bigger-than-originally-reported-and-what-about-Kherson

Moscow's forces have pulled back from dozens of Ukraine's besieged settlements in recent days, leaving behind a trail of devastation and alleged war crimes, most notably in Bucha, near Kyiv.

The Russians' withdrawal, believed to be an attempt to revamp their offensive with a concerted effort to capture the eastern Donbas region, has sparked a glimmer of hope for the future of Kherson.

The southern city, home to almost 290,000 before Putin's invasion in February, has been occupied by Russian forces for more than a month now.

Despite capturing the city, Moscow's troops were immediately met with waves of peaceful resistance from locals, who assembled in town squares armed with Ukrainian flags to defy their new occupiers.

As Ukraine's heroic fightback against the invading forces continues, the country's armed forces are hopeful that Kyiv will sanction an attack on Russian-occupied Kherson.

BUCHA: Evidence of alleged war crimes was uncovered after Russian forces withdrew from Bucha, near Kyiv, on April 4

Putin was last week forced into a withering face-saving climbdown over the failed march on the capital - that his forces, which have been devastated with more than 20 battalions wiped out since the start of the war, would focus on 'liberating' the eastern Donbas region instead of trying to take the capital.

Russian forces have also withdrawn from Chernihiv, Konotop, Chernobyl, Sloboda and Lukashivka in recent days after facing staunch resistance from Kyiv's troops and volunteers.

Their forces completely withdrew from the northern suburbs of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on April 4, leaving behind evidence of war crimes in Bucha. Pictures show the charred bodies of dead civilians who were shot at close range, many of them powerless to resist with their hands tied behind their backs.

Russian airstrikes hit Odessa early, sending up at least three columns of black smoke with flames visible apparently in an industrial area but there were no reported casualties. Rocket strikes also hit Mykolaiv and were blamed on Moscow's men by the city's mayor.

Heavy fighting was reported in Mariupol in southern Ukraine as Moscow's troops keep trying to take the besieged port city where thousands of civilians have been trapped since the early days of Putin's war.

Moscow's men are thought to be regrouping on Ukraine's eastern border ahead of a heavy onslaught on the Donbas region and residents in Donetsk and Luhansk have been told to evacuate now ahead of the impending manoeuvre.

The besieged southern port city Mariupol, where residents have been trapped without food, water, electricity or heat for more than a month, has continued to hold firm against Moscow's attacks despite facing continued Russian bombardment and heavy street-to-street fighting.

The city's mayor Vadym Boichenko said more than 5,000 civilians have been killed, including 210 children. British defence officials estimate that 160,000 people remain trapped in the city, which had a prewar population of 430,000.

Putin's inner circle has asserted Mariupol is part of the 'Luhansk people's republic' which Russia recognises as a separate state and claim troops were there 'to assist those people who were suffering for eight years from heavy shelling from Ukraine'.

Mykolaiv, Severodonetsk and Kharkiv have continued to come under Russian shelling though Moscow has failed to take control of any of the three cities. Meanwhile Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said today that 'those who choose war always lose'.

His comments come after drone footage emerged showing an obliterated Russian convoy lying along a highway west of Kyiv following an ambush by Zelensky's troops - a tactic Ukraine has employed to great success across the country to repel Putin's vast numbers of slow-moving military hardware.

The UK's aid sent to Ukraine is being ramped up as Foreign Secretary Liz Truss warned ‚Äòa more concentrated Russian offensive‚Äô could be seen in the days and weeks ahead as she met Nato foreign ministers in Brussels.

Putin's fresh offensive is expected to involve tens of thousands of Russian troops taking on Ukraine forces in the east of the country in an attempt to proclaim a fa√ßade of triumph on Russia's Victory Day on May 9.

Heavily damaged buildings and apartment blocks are seen in a satellite image of Mariupol, where more than 100,000 people are still said to be stranded in conditions likened to a 'hell-scape'

It comes as Vladimir Putin's spokesman has admitted Russia has suffered 'significant troop losses' in its invasion of Ukraine but dismissed claims of war crimes in Bucha and Mariupol as 'fake'.

Speaking on Sky News, Dmitry Peskov failed to reveal exactly how many Russian soldiers had died but said: 'We have significant losses of troops. And it's a huge tragedy for us.'

Russia in late March said it had lost 1,351 soldiers with another 3,825 wounded. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said two days later that at least 10,000 Russian soldiers had probably been killed.

Ukrainian officials are gathering evidence of Russian atrocities in Bucha and other cities, amid signs Moscow's troops killed people indiscriminately before retreating.

The bodies of least 410 civilians have been found in towns around Kyiv - victims of what President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said was a Russian campaign of murder, rape, dismemberment and torture.

Since Bucha, a chorus has resounded at the highest levels of Western political power calling for accountability, prosecution and punishment for war crimes in Ukraine.

On Monday, Zelensky denounced the killings as 'genocide' and 'war crimes,' and U.S. President Joe Biden said Putin was 'a war criminal' who should be brought to trial.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10698187/Ukrainian-soldiers-hope-retake-city-Kherson-DAYS-Russian-forces-continue-withdrawal.html
