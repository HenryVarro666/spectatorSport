Large crowds gathered in the southern port of Melitopol on Saturday to protest the alleged abduction of the city’s mayor, Ivan Fedorov, by Russian troops, an act that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described as “a crime against democracy.” Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight Kirill Timoshenko, the deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential office, posted a video to his Telegram account of what he said was a group of Russian soldiers taking Fedorov away on Friday through a town square, with what appears to be a hood over his head. Footage captured by closed-circuit television spread on social media Friday. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, corroborated Timoshenko’s claim, saying Fedorov refused to cooperate with the Russian forces occupying the city and was taken away by 10 soldiers.

“During the abduction, they put a plastic bag over his head,” Gerashchenko told Interfax Ukraine. “The enemy detained him in the city crisis center, where he dealt with the life support of the Ukrainian city.”

Russia has accused Fedorov of “terrorist activities,” according to the Associated Press. The prosecutor’s office of the Luhansk People’s Republic, a Moscow-backed rebel region in eastern Ukraine, has claimed without presenting evidence that Fedorov was financing the nationalist militia Right Sector to “commit terrorist crimes against Donbas civilians.”

Zelensky confirmed that Russian forces had captured Fedorov and demanded that Russia “release him from captivity immediately.”

“The detention of the mayor of Melitopol is a crime against democracy,” he said at a news conference Saturday in Kyiv, adding that Russia should be ashamed of its actions.

The Ukrainian president said the alleged abduction of Fedorov, which he called “simple terrorism,” is the latest of a number of actions against mayors across the country who do not cooperate with the Russian forces occupying their cities and towns. Melitopol, with a population of about 150,000, has been under Russian control for two weeks. Despite the Russian occupation of the city, Fedorov, who is ethnic Russian, had encouraged recent demonstrations in Melitopol against Russia.

“They are not ashamed of that video,” Zelensky said of the Russians allegedly abducting Fedorov, asserting that the invading forces were “moving to a new stage of terror.”

Zelensky said he raised the fate of Fedorov in calls to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron, urging the leaders to “get in touch” with Russian President Vladimir Putin “to free the mayor.”

The mayor’s alleged abduction prompted roughly 2,000 people on Saturday to protest outside the city hall building occupied by Russian forces, Zelensky said. Bundled-up against the cold, protesters in Melitopol chanted for Fedorov’s release.

“Bring back the mayor! Bring back the mayor!” they chanted. “Freedom to the mayor! Freedom to the mayor!”

The demonstration took place against a backdrop of an intensifying Russian assault on Ukraine. Russian troops advanced Saturday into the eastern outskirts of Mariupol, a strategic port on Ukraine’s southern coast, and several cities across the country, from Kyiv, the capital, to Mykolaiv, another key city on the Black Sea, continued to face withering bombardments. Ukrainian officials are accusing Russia of striking a hospital in Mykolaiv and a mosque in Mariupol.

Meanwhile, the humanitarian disaster is mounting, with nearly 2.6 million Ukrainians fleeing the country since the start of the invasion, according to the United Nations. After local officials in Poland, to which 1.5 million refugees from Ukraine have fled, warned that they were struggling to cope with the arrivals, Germany said Saturday that other countries must “step up” to help with the massive influx of Ukrainian refugees.

Zelensky said Saturday that any peace negotiations with Russia and Putin can begin only with a cease-fire agreement. Speaking to reporters in Kyiv, Zelensky said that he is open to negotiations with Putin and that he has discussed the possibility of negotiations being held in Jerusalem with Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett as facilitator. But Zelensky emphasized that real negotiations for peace could not begin until the two sides agree to a cease-fire.

“Our diplomats are working, and they have talked over some items of a possible agenda between us and the Russian Federation,” Zelensky told reporters. “I want this to materialize and the process of ending the war, the process of peace, 100 percent should begin with cease-fire.”

About 1,300 Ukrainian troops have been killed by Russian forces since the start of the invasion last month, Zelensky said. The Ukrainian president added that between 500 and 600 Russian troops surrendered Friday. The Washington Post has not verified either of these figures.

Melitopol, a city where Russian is commonly spoken, is about 145 miles northeast of the Crimean Peninsula, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. While the city came under assault at the start of the invasion and was quickly taken over, Fedorov had remained defiant, saying, “We are not cooperating with the Russians in any way.”

As residents took to the streets of Melitopol last weekend to wave the blue and gold colors of Ukraine, Fedorov encouraged the demonstrations, even amid the Russian occupation.

“Together we will overcome anything!” he wrote in a Facebook post that has since been made private.

Now, Ukrainian officials are trying to find where he is being held. Ukrainian diplomat Olexander Scherba wrote Saturday on Twitter that Fedorov was still alive.

“They torture him to force [him] to collaborate,” Scherba said of the Russians.

Even as Russian forces aimed to shut down Saturday’s protest, Zelensky reiterated to reporters that he was “grateful to every Melitopol resident for this resistance” by demonstrating in response to the alleged abduction of Fedorov. He also suggested to Putin that the war is unpopular among Russians.

“Do you hear it, Moscow?” he asked. “If 2,000 people are protesting against the occupation in Melitopol, how many people should be in Moscow against the war?”

Elected Melitopol Mayor Ivan Fedorov was seen on video Friday with a hood over his head, being led away from a government building by armed men. The Russian-backed Luhansk regional prosecutor claimed that Fedorov had committed terrorism offenses and was under investigation.

Newly installed unelected mayor Galina Danilchenko said in her televised statement that her “main task is to take all necessary steps to get the city back to normal,” CNN reported.

“I ask you to keep your wits about you and not to give in to these provocations,” she added.

Danilchenko also ironically suggested organizing a “People’s Choice Committee” to “solve all the critical issues for ... the Melitopol region.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday lashed the kidnapping of Melitopol’s legitimate mayor, comparing it to the actions of “ISIS terrorists.” He called it a “crime against democracy.”

Russia has “transitioned into a new stage of terror, in which they try to physically liquidate representatives of Ukraine’s lawful local authorities,” Zelenskyy said in a video address. He called it “simple terrorism.”

Federov’s disappearance sparked a protest Saturday by some 2,000 city residents outside its city hall occupied by Russian forces, The Washington Post reported.

Galina Danilchenko, a former member of the city council, was proclaimed the acting mayor on local TV Saturday, CNN reported.

Mayor Ivan Fedorov was taken from Melitopol’s crisis center Friday with a plastic bag over his head after he “refused to cooperate with the enemy,” Ukraine’s parliament said.

More than 2,000 residents of the Russian-occupied city in the Kremlin-backed rebel region of Luhansk staged a rally to support Fedorov Saturday, while Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky demanded his immediate release.

But in a televised statement, Danilchenko said she aimed to get the city “back to normal” and warned against those who would “provoke a reaction of bad behavior.”

Chilling CCTV footage showed the moment Ivan Fedorov, the mayor of the besieged city, had a plastic bag placed over his head as he was escorted out of a building and across a square by Russian forces.

Later, huge crowds ignored Vladimir Putin's occupiers demands to stay away as they gathered outside the building where the city chief was last seen being dragged away by Moscow's troops.

Other protestors were pictured enthusiastically waving placards calling for the mayor's release.

Ukraine's premier heaped praise on the citizens of Melitopol who 'did not surrender to the invaders'.

He added that Fedorov's capture was an 'attempt to bring the city to its knees' and called for the immediate release of the besieged settlement's mayor.

Zelensky also called on Russian forces to heed the calls of residents in the occupied city of Melitopol who protested to demand that Ivan Fedorov be freed.

At a press conference, Zelensky said: 'The demand is simple - to release [Fedorov] from captivity immediately'.

Ukrainian officials and Zelensky claimed on Friday that 10 Russian soldiers had kidnapped Ivan Fedorov from the city's crisis centre while he had a bag over his head.

CCTV footage, posted on Telegram by the deputy head of Ukraine's presidential office, appears to show a group of men escorting Mr Fedorov out of a building and across a square.

Zelensky, who spoke earlier Saturday with the leaders of Germany and France, described the alleged detention of Fedorov as an attempt 'to bring the city to its knees'.

He also said Ukraine expects 'the leaders of the world to show how they can influence the liberation (of) a man who personifies Ukrainians who do not give up'.

Following the alleged kidnapping, Ukrainian officials said 2,000 people took to the streets of Melitopol to protest.

Video footage, shared by officials, appeared to show crowds of defiant residents carrying Ukrainian flags as they gathered near an occupied administration building.

Ukraine's parliament claimed Mr Fedorov was kidnapped by 10 armed men, who placed a plastic bag over his head. Russia has not commented on the fate of Mr Fedorov.

The clip, which has been shared widely by Ukrainian media, is believed to have been filmed in Melitopol's Victory Square in southeastern Ukraine.

President Zelensky on Friday described Mr Fedorov's alleged abduction as a 'crime' against 'democracy' as he said the acts of Russian invaders would be treated as 'terrorism'.

'The capture of the mayor of Melitopol is therefore a crime, not only against a particular person, against a particular community, and not only against Ukraine. It is a crime against democracy itself... The acts of the Russian invaders will be regarded like those of Islamic State terrorists,' he said.

Ukrainian officials claimed that Melitopol's mayor had been kidnapped after he 'refused to co-operate with the enemy'.

Zelensky also accused Vladimir Putin's troops of 'moving to a new stage of terror' due to a lack of support for the invasion in Ukraine.

'This is obviously a sign of weakness of the invaders... They have moved to a new stage of terror in which they are trying to physically eliminate representatives of legitimate local Ukrainian authorities,' he added.

Zelensky hailed Mr Fedorov as a mayor who 'bravely defends Ukraine' and his community as he said the resistance of Ukrainians would not be changed by 'putting pressure on mayors or kidnapping mayors'.

The prosecutor's office of the Luhansk People's Republic, a Moscow-backed rebel region in eastern Ukraine, said on its website there was a criminal case against Mr Fedorov.

The office accused him of 'terrorist activities' and of financing the nationalist militia Right Sector to 'commit terrorist crimes against Donbass civilians'.

Ukraine's ministry of foreign affairs described the alleged abduction as a war crime, adding: 'We call on the international community to respond immediately to the abduction of Ivan Fedorov and other civilians, and to increase pressure on Russia to end its barbaric war against the Ukrainian people.'

Russian forces captured Melitopol, which has a population of 150,000, on February 26.

Elsewhere in Ukraine, Zelensky accused Russia of refusing to allow evacuees to escape the city of Mariupol, which has been cut off from food, water and electricity, and defiantly insisted vital supplies would be delivered there tomorrow despite it being surrounded by Russian troops.

The Kremlin-owned Tass news agency painted a damning picture for those stuck in the city after quoting Russian Colonel Mikhail Mizintsev as saying all bridge into the city were destroyed and roads had been laid with mines.

'Russian troops have not let our aid into the city and continue to torture our people... tomorrow [Saturday] we will try again, try again to send food, water and medicine' Zelensky said.

Elsewhere in Ukraine, the crisis in Mariupol deepened yet further last night as the death toll passed 1,500. Pictured: The aftermath of Russian artillery shelling on a residential area in Mariupol where a rocket hit a house

Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, tweeted: 'Besieged Mariupol is now the worst humanitarian catastrophe on the planet. 1,582 dead civilians in 12 days, even buried in mass graves. Unable to defeat the Ukrainian army, Putin bombs the unarmed, blocks humanitarian aid. We need planes to stop Russian war crimes!'

A total of 7,144 people escaped four Ukrainian cities on Friday using humanitarian corridors, President Zelensky said in a televised address, a sharply lower number than managed to leave in each of the two previous days.

It comes as Putin struck areas in central and western Ukraine, some hundreds of miles from the capital Kyiv and huge explosions illuminated the night sky in Dnipro and Lutsk as residents experienced Russian artillery attacks for the first time.

In Ivano-Frankivsk, a triple strike hit at first light, said to be targeting an airfield on the edge of the city. Indiscriminate shelling at 4am UK time yesterday left tower blocks and a factory ablaze in Dnipro, killing a security guard.

Meanwhile, the 40-mile convoy of tanks, troops and artillery that had been bearing down on Kyiv in recent days is understood to have moved into strategic firing positions ahead of an all-out assault on the capital.

Fears have been mounting that Moscow could attempt a repeat at the barbaric bombing used on besieged cities such as Mariupol, with Russian troops now just nine miles from the city.

Satellite images showed howitzer weaponry and suspected rocket launchers being readied, prompting remaining Kyiv residents to take up arms and erect barricades. Mayor Vitali Klitschko warned Russia the city was a fortress.

It comes as military experts say they are baffled by the ineptitude of the tactics displayed by Russia's armies after drone footage yesterday showed a column of tanks getting picked off one-by-one in an ambush carried out by Ukraine's forces.

Analysts have said Russian tank commanders allowed the Ukrainians to ambush their unit by driving down the middle of a main road leading into Kyiv - and straight into a death trap. By multiple counts, President Vladimir Putin's forces have lost more tanks than are operational in the entire German army.

The failure to establish control of Kyiv could force Putin to negotiate a settlement sooner than expected.

Yesterday, he said there had been 'positive changes' from the talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials as he welcomed Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko to Moscow.

Some Russian units are now just nine miles from Kyiv.

There are fears they will attempt to repeat the barbaric tactics used on other cities including Mariupol, which is surrounded – with those inside suffering starvation and dehydration.
