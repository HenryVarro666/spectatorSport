Putin’s efforts to reconstitute empire and “protect” Russian speakers beyond national borders tap into currents of history running deep underneath our collective experience. And in many ways, the tolls of the war—cities reduced to rubble, civilians caught amid armies, refugees moving en masse across European borders, threats of nuclear annihilation—recall the circumstances that shocked world powers into creating an international system to prevent another world war. Perhaps it is no coincidence that at precisely the time when living memory of World War II is fading away, humanity has failed to heed the lessons of our worst history.

Yet despite its historical echoes, the war also feels like the product of the peculiar circumstances of our post–Cold War era. The backlash to globalization, consumerism, and cultural homogeneity sent strongmen in search of an updated brand of identity politics. The corruption that enriched kleptocrats isolated them from accountability, engendering cynicism and apathy within societies. The creation of national-security states veiled the machinations of governments while providing endless justifications for defensive aggression. New technologies facilitated the dissemination of propaganda and disinformation on a mass scale, so that it’s hard to tell where Putin’s invented pretexts end and his own motivations begin.

This post is excerpted from Rhodes’s recent book.

These forces are not unique to Russia; they are all around us, and have left us in an unsustainable situation. How could this many nationalist autocrats emerge in so many different places, working from such a similar playbook? How much more strain could a creaky international system bear before it broke? How could problems be solved, wars avoided, and democracy defended when truth and objective reality were becoming so flexible, with people locked in different closets of information? How much longer could the pressures build before an explosion?

Putin has long been a source of these pressures, simultaneously dragging us back into the darker recesses of history while capitalizing on the vulnerabilities of our present moment. He was at the vanguard of autocrats who claimed power through democracy only to dismantle it. He enriched his circle by selling commodities to the West while lambasting its immorality. He disrupted the international system by taking advantage of the obstruction it afforded him. He suppressed dissent while flooding social media with disinformation that radicalized not only Russians but communities around the world. Vladimir Putin is both a figure of the past and a man of his time.

Over the course of 2019 and 2020, I spoke with prominent Russian critics of Putin—including Alexey Navalny, his most effective and relentless domestic opponent—for a book about the rise of authoritarianism around the world. Those conversations about the authoritarian machinery that Putin had built were laced with foreboding about the future. Ironically, given what has been unleashed in their name, Russians feel the weight of history and how it can go wrong more acutely than most. The immensity of Putin’s corruption and the triumphalism of his nationalist aggression bespoke an excess that made overreach seem inevitable. No, this was not sustainable.

Ukraine has the tragic misfortune of being the venue for this overreach. Its very existence places it at the center of the overlapping circles of Putin’s grievances. The last frontier of NATO expansion. The largest foothold for democracy along Russia’s borders. The litmus test for whether Putin could reconstitute not the Soviet Union—he’s not seeking to annex Kyrgyzstan or return to communism—but rather the Russian empire. But Ukraine also encompasses the contradictions of our recent era. Its openness rendered it vulnerable to corruption, which could be leveraged for influence. Its hardening commitment to national sovereignty was linked to a determination to join supranational clubs such as the European Union and NATO. Tragically, Ukrainians’ determination to survive made them a bigger target for Putin’s aggression.

In 2004, Putin summed up Russia’s post-Soviet history and his own worldview succinctly: “We demonstrated weakness, and the weak are beaten.” Clearly, he calculated that Ukrainians—and the wider democratic world—had weakened enough to be beaten. Thus far, it is Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, who is upending Putin’s logic. By standing up to a bully, Zelensky has stripped him of his capacity to intimidate. A younger man—communicating through selfie videos and Zoom, wearing a T-shirt instead of a suit, often surrounded by people instead of sitting at the end of a large table—Zelensky has come to encompass a populism not of cynicism and grievance but of idealism and community. In his fearlessness he resembles Navalny, who has taunted Putin from his prison cell and predicted that the war will be Putin’s downfall.

Out of this kind of righteous rage—shaking democracies from complacency, forcing citizens to discard the luxury of cynicism, rejecting the inevitability of autocracy—perhaps a new world can be born. We have reached a hinge of history. At issue is not just the future of Ukraine but that of the world that will emerge on the other side of this war. If we heed the lessons of this moment, we can rebuild from the rubble a renewed international order that once again places democratic values over the more transitory impulses of profit and immediate gratification. If we don’t, things could get much worse.

Speaking with me nearly two years ago, Navalny distinguished his own nationalism from Putin’s, while anticipating the inevitability of Putin’s overreach. He, and the other Russians I spoke with, foresaw the dangerous moment that we have now reached. What neither they nor I can predict, of course, is how it will end.

Alexey Navalny has been a difficult adversary for Putin in part because he’s not the kind of Russian oppositionist who tells Americans what they want to hear. When we spoke in the spring of 2020, this became obvious as soon as I broached the subject of Ukraine, the country that—in some way—had precipitated everything from Russia’s offensive against American democracy to Donald Trump’s first impeachment. “You cannot just give Crimea back,” he told me.

Navalny reminded me that his father was Ukrainian and his mother Russian, so he grew up spending time in both countries. He described childhood visits to his Ukrainian family after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when these visits were now to an independent country. “All through the ’90s, we have a family argument. Every dinner, every family gathering, we have this discussion: What is better, to preserve the Soviet Union or to be divided?”

From the Ukrainian perspective, the answer was clear. “We were feeding you,” he recalled his Ukrainian family telling him, since Ukraine had been the breadbasket of the Soviet Union. “‘Now we’re independent and we’re going to live much, much better.’ And this was kind of a central idea.” Central to the forces that drove Ukrainians into the streets in the Orange Revolution in 2005 and onto the Maidan in 2013. Central to Ukraine’s desire to draw closer to Europe, to join the European Union and NATO. To be more prosperous, and free of Russian domination—that was the Ukrainian desire.

From the Russian perspective, he said, the answer was also clear.

“My mother, who is Russian, and I would say, ‘Give us Crimea and get the hell out of here,’” he recalled. Crimea is separated from mainland Ukraine and Russia, a peninsula that sticks out into the Black Sea. Its population is majority ethnic Russian, but the territory was shifted to Ukraine in the middle of the 20th century, part of the opaque Kremlin maneuvering of people and places designed to shore up the Soviet empire. “It was something deep inside every Russian—this understanding that the people in Crimea are Russian people. And without any real reason, they were given to Ukraine by Khrushchev.”

Navalny clearly saw himself as someone who could become the president of his country. And this, in his view, meant not succumbing to the American position on Crimea. “If I’m president,” he said, “I want to have something fair. A real, fair referendum under independent observers.” This he contrasted with the rushed Potemkin referendum on Crimea’s future that took place under the watch of Russian occupiers in 2014. “Everyone will understand the results of this referendum,” Navalny told me, anticipating—of course—that the result would be the same: Crimea would remain a part of Russia.

Instead of criticizing the outcome of Putin’s annexation of Crimea, Navalny focused on his motivation: Putin’s fixation on the United States and an encroaching West, the constant warnings that Crimea would become a base for NATO ships or nuclear weapons. “He’s playing with something real,” he said of Putin’s Ukraine policy and broader political project—that sense of making amends for the humiliations of the past. “But he’s twisting it, he’s perverting it, he’s using the huge apparatus of propaganda and media to connect it to anti-American and anti-Western propaganda.”

To Navalny, approaching the issue of Crimea as a kind of geopolitical chess move diminished the very legitimacy that should buttress the union of Crimea with Russia, the fact that it was—to him—the right thing on the merits. It also bespoke a dangerous and self-destructive habit of Russian leaders to seek legitimacy at home through the pursuit of conquest or power abroad. “These delusions about empire,” he said, “this is the most dangerous stuff for Russia. Because it is why we were poor all the time. We were poor back in the Russian empire with the czars because they spent everything on empire. The same in the Soviet Union. Back in the U.S.S.R., we paid for Cuba, we paid for half of Africa, we paid for half of Asia. So we were poor. People don’t have a color-TV set in their apartment, they don’t have any cars even in the ’80s, but we spent billions of dollars around the world.”

This imperial pursuit also allowed leaders to obscure their own corruption, distracting people from their own lot in life by offering a connection to some glory-seeking project. In the absence of a program, Putin’s campaign slogan had been simply, Putin’s Plan Is the Victory of Russia. Barack Obama used to tell me: In the long game, a politician’s strength can always become his weakness. This could become true for Putin and his total identification with the effort of once again projecting Russian strength abroad. “Can’t we spend our energy and the money of our country for ourselves?” Navalny asked incredulously. “Syria,” he said, referring to Putin’s intervention on behalf of Bashar al-Assad, which was viewed as a strategic masterstroke by many Western analysts, “it doesn’t work at all. They wanted to repeat this trick from Crimea and the Ukraine war. But people are so annoyed. Syria?” he repeated, as if the absurdity were self-evident.

“Why should we fight with these kinds of guys? We’re restoring Aleppo. Repair some roads here!”

As usual, the thing that grated most on Navalny about Putin’s rhetorical broadsides against the West was how they elided the extent to which everything Putin did was in service of power and profit. “What is the best response to Putin?” Navalny asked, clearly prepared to answer his own question. “Look, if the West is so mean and bad and ugly, and there are gays everywhere and the gay marriages, and morality is dying—which they are talking about all the time—my response is: I’m showing that these guys who are blaming the West have a palace somewhere in France. Showing people they are using their families, and their nostalgia to live in a great country—‘Make Russia great again’—they’re using it for their own personal good and personal profit.” Navalny paused for effect. “We can have a great country, who can be a leader of Europe and one of the best countries in the world, without that stuff.”

Navalny still believed that Putin’s house of cards was going to collapse at some point, the same way the czars’ did, the same way the Soviets’ did, perhaps the same way the United States’ did under Trump. Putinism may have started from something pure, something visceral, that humiliation of the post-Soviet years, but it had been corrupted, twisted, and rendered devoid of meaning—particularly as it spread beyond Russia’s borders. Perhaps Putin was marching himself over the precipice.

What sustained Navalny was anger at the state of things around him. He was, he told me, determined to “preserve and keep my level of rage to stay in politics.”

What sustained the rage? I asked him.

“It was lying,” he said. “The Soviet Union was an empire based on a lie. And Putin’s Russia is a country based on a lie.” He had seen it firsthand, confronting corruption schemes in Moscow courts and finding that the legal apparatus that was supposed to enforce fairness was on the take. “You are facing these people in the courts and they are lying to you.”

On August 20, 2020, Alexey Navalny was poisoned and nearly killed.

Like Boris Nemtsov’s death or the foreign intervention in the 2016 American presidential election, the details of the story were murky and would change over time, but the gist of it was again clear: Putin was behind this. Watching this, thinking of all the various reasons that Putin may have had for doing it—the messages he intended to send to Navalny, other oppositionists, or the wider world—I knew that his motivations boiled down to one thing: He did it because he could.

Do we want to live in a world where innocent people are poisoned with impunity? What kind of people would do that, and what dynamics enable them to get away with it? Sometimes people like Navalny are able to actually win power, to see things change. But perhaps even more powerfully, in their darkest moments they show us the true nature of those they oppose.

In early 2016, I met with a group of Russian writers in a small room in the West Wing. It was one of those meetings that broke up the monotony of my days, that peculiar opportunity you have, when serving at high levels of government, to choose to meet with a group of interesting people. In this case, it was a handful of writers sponsored by PEN, the organization that supports journalists and authors facing oppression around the world. I remember the familiar feeling of meeting with a group of people whom I could not possibly seem to help. Throughout the meeting, I was distracted by the fact that one of the women looked uncannily like my mother, which led my mind to wander and wonder just how far east my family’s journey had begun before the pogroms drove them across Poland and then to America. I asked the writers if they had any concerns about being affiliated with an American organization like PEN, or about meeting with people like me. No, they answered. It was their choice. What they wanted was not so much help as the simple opportunity to share their experience and perspective, which is, after all, a starting point for writing itself.

One of the writers in that 2016 meeting was Maria Stepanova. Maria had come of age in the ’90s and had established herself as one of Russia’s leading poets, in addition to being a novelist, a journalist, and the publisher of a crowdfunded website on news and culture. In the spring of 2020, I noticed an interview in which Maria spoke about the dark humor of being Russian, the realization that everyone has two identities: the one put forward in public and political spaces, and the private life lived behind closed doors. I thought she could help me make sense of the ways in which politics and identity in our two countries had blended in such a disorienting way.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Maria told me, “Russia had become a country that has forgotten what it means to have a history, a country that has fallen out of history.” It had become a country with a history filled with ghosts—the enormous suffering of the Soviet years, along with the sense of loss that accompanied the collapse of the Soviet Union. And it was ripe for something to fill that vacuum.

When Putin retook the presidency in 2012, Maria sensed a shift in him. From my perspective, this reflected the political calculation of a man who could no longer count on high oil prices to lubricate his corruption and consolidation of power, a man in need of legitimacy who turned to a convenient nationalism. But to Maria, Putin’s shift also reflected a man who felt politically and personally wounded at home when his return to office was met by huge demonstrations led by the likes of Alexey Navalny. “These were beneficiaries of his reign,” Maria said, referring to the middle-class Muscovites who protested in the streets, “people that he was identifying himself with in a way.” Perhaps Putin was like Russia—a man who felt himself falling out of history. Perhaps the cold, corrupt logic of power was not his sole source of motivation—to a man like Putin, falling out of history can engender its own rage.

After his reelection, Putin gave a speech to an enormous crowd in Moscow in which he quoted the great Russian poet Mikhail Lermontov. In one of Lermontov’s most famous poems, he wrote about the Napoleonic Wars, the first of two crises when Russians put aside their differences to repel an enemy at the gates. “We shall die before Moscow, as died our brothers. To die we swore, and our oath of fealty kept on the field of Borodino.” When Putin read these lines, Maria recalled, he had tears in his eyes. Putin saw the collapse of the Soviet Union and the ensuing tide of globalization as another advance on Moscow, embodied in those 2011 protests led by Western-oriented Muscovites.

With his attacks on Ukraine in 2014, Putin rejoined history—the history that has dominated most of humanity’s time on the planet, when nations fought wars over territory and reconquered places that had been taken away. Blood and soil. Of course, Putin framed that conquest as necessary to stop another enemy at the gates of Moscow. Like everyone else I talked with, Maria noticed the omnipresence of a virulent patriotism inseparable from the person of Putin. But she also noticed a broader effort to reshape the consciousness of the nation. “I noticed the difference in the amount of violence around you,” she said, “on television, social networks, etcetera. It is violence you feel in the air. But the level of actual violence was quite low.”

Compared with the battles of Russia’s past, the actual fighting in eastern Ukraine was a small endeavor affecting mainly the people there and the few thousand Russians sent furtively across Ukraine’s borders. But there was something brutal and infectious about the propaganda that went along with it. I noticed it at the time. In memes that anticipated American conspiracy theories such as QAnon, Russia’s enemies were cast as pedophiles, sexual deviants, and diabolical criminals. This ability to manipulate and mobilize the national psyche while keeping the stakes relatively low represented a breakthrough for Putin, making easy use of America’s unregulated and sensationalizing social-media networks. “People are happy to be violent in the social networks,” Maria said. “In that space, there has been rhetorical violence in Russia for the last 10 years, through the discourse of hate on social networks.”

Maria observed that the discourse was now “tracking something in the unconscious from the dystopia of the 20th century.” For Russia, that included everything from Stalin’s purges to its war in Afghanistan to the collapse of the Soviet Union. Even the violence of Chechnya, the terrorism of the early 2000s, the murdered children of Beslan, still lingered. Whether it was out of conviction, for political convenience, or—more likely—some mix of both, Putin knew how to make Russians feel that they were reentering history. The assassination of Boris Nemtsov and the poisoning of Alexey Navalny can be seen as an extension of that trauma, actions that keep history alive.

Maria volunteered that if she had the opportunity to vote for Navalny for mayor of Moscow again, she would do so. But while his single-minded focus on corruption represented a needed change, she did not think it was sufficient. Instead, she said, a more radical shift had to take place. To her, this was the other side of the coin from Navalny’s interest in upending a corrupt cabal: the simple notion that politics and government had to be rooted in truth. “People are yearning for a sense of truth, for a certain sense of reality that is always being distorted. People are asking for something that is based on an ethical frame.”

The danger of the other path is catastrophe. The history that Putin had reentered was the older kind, which inevitably leads nations down rivers to the heart of darkness, borne on the currents that gave rise to fascism and communism, Hitler and Stalin, two men who caused the deaths of tens of millions of Russians. When history appeared to come to an end at the conclusion of the Cold War, the specter of another world war was lifted, and with it some of the sense of drama that Putin had tapped into. And while wars fought online were not often tied to actual violence, a dizzying array of narratives recirculated those old 20th-century forces in new packaging—in particular, a creeping and sometimes casual fascism that suited Putin.

As a Russian, Maria knew how this kind of history could hurt people, in ways that Americans, too often, do not. Every Russian had been touched by World War II. Every Russian family had suffered in some way through the Soviet times. This was the main thing she had to tell us Americans, I realized—this warning. She felt the return of history. “I am afraid of some catastrophe that is going to happen,” she said to me in 2020, referring to her state of mind the past few years. “I feel it in my bones. I am sharing this with my compatriots: There is going to be a new war, World War III, or the gulags, or the trials.”",https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/03/ben-rhodes-alexey-navalny-maria-stepanova/627049/

This article is brought to you in association with the European Parliament.

On Thursday, the European Parliament adopted three resolutions on the respective human rights situations in Myanmar, Mexico and Nagorno-Karabakh.

Myanmar, one year after the coup

More than a year after the coup d’état in Myanmar on 1 February 2021, Parliament reiterates that it strongly condemns the military junta’s violent seizure of power and the ensuing heinous atrocities carried out against the country’s population, including mass killings and other widespread human rights violations.

MEPs call on the military, under the leadership of Commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing, to fully respect the outcome of the democratic elections held in November 2020, to release detained former State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and all other political prisoners, reinstate the civilian government and to take steps to establish a dialogue and reconciliation with all parties concerned.

In the resolution, Members also underline how appalled they are over the Tatmadaw’s (Burmese military) crimes against ethnic and religious groups in the country, including the Rohingya population and Christians. They welcome the EU’s decision to introduce and expand sanctions on Myanmar as a result of the coup and subsequent repression but call for further tougher measures – central banks reserves could be targeted, for example.

The text was adopted by 646 votes in favour, 1 against and 20 abstentions. For further details, the full version of the report will be available here. (10.03.2022)

The situation of journalists and human rights defenders in Mexico

MEPs condemn the alarming rate at which journalists and human rights defenders in Mexico, including environmental defenders and indigenous people, are being threatened, harassed and killed.

The resolution notes that Mexico has long been the most dangerous and deadliest place for journalists outside an official war zone, as reported by different non-governmental organisations. It states that, according to official sources, at least 47 journalists have been assassinated in the country since the last presidential elections in July 2018.

In addition to the threats posed by drug cartels and other criminal networks, Parliament also notes with concern the “systematic and tough critiques” used by the highest authorities of the Mexican Government against journalists and their work, while condemning the frequent attacks on media freedom and media workers. MEPs call on the authorities to refrain from stigmatising journalists and human rights defenders and to ensure their protection.

The text states explicitly that Mexico’s President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has often used press briefings to denigrate and intimidate independent journalists. MEPs say this rhetoric of abuse generates an atmosphere of relentless unrest towards independent media.

The text was adopted by 607 votes in favour, 2 against and 73 abstentions. It will be available in full here. (10.03.2022)



The destruction of cultural heritage in Nagorno-Karabakh

Parliament strongly condemns Azerbaijan’s continued policy of erasing and denying the Armenian cultural heritage in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, in violation of international law and the recent Order of the International Court of Justice stating that Azerbaijan must prevent and punish any acts of vandalism and desecration.

The text acknowledges that the erasure of Armenian cultural heritage in the region is part of a wider pattern of a systematic, state-level policy of “Armenophobia”, historical revisionism and hatred towards Armenians promoted by the Azerbaijani authorities.

It also underlines that cultural heritage has a universal dimension as a testimony of history inseparable from peoples’ identity, which the international community has to protect and preserve for future generations.

The latest armed conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan ended with an agreement on a complete ceasefire that entered into force on 10 November 2020.

The resolution was adopted by 635 votes in favour, 2 against and 42 abstentions. For further details, the full version will be available here. (16.12.2021)",https://europeansting.com/2022/03/11/human-rights-breaches-in-myanmar-mexico-and-nagorno-karabakh/

4,490def92-cafd-4201-b361-3302c097cf68,"['Sam Brodey', 'Congressional Reporter']",2022-03-11 09:56:40.173000+00:00,"In his last job, Jeff Flake went to work every day with the risk of provoking the wrath of the world’s most powerful person: then-President Donald Trump.

Three years after he retired as a Republican U.S. senator from Arizona rather than hold his tongue about the president, Flake has found himself a new job. And somehow, it might make his old one look like a breeze by comparison.

With the world on edge over Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, Flake is stationed halfway across the world, serving as U.S. ambassador to a complicated ally with a unique ability to push for peace: Turkey.

When President Joe Biden nominated Flake to the post last year, the move was seen as a way for Biden to signal his commitment to bipartisanship—and, perhaps, a reward for Flake, who campaigned for Biden in 2020.

But in some corners, the ex-senator’s selection raised eyebrows. It had been 40 years since a non-career diplomat was selected for this high-profile and sensitive job. Flake not only had no special expertise in the politics of the region; he had never so much as set foot in Turkey.

In his September 2021 confirmation hearing, Flake’s former Senate colleagues warned he had his work cut out for him in the Turkish capital of Ankara. But that was months before Russian President Vladimir Putin decided to invade Ukraine, immediately making Flake’s already complicated job even more difficult.

Nearly every close observer of the Muslim-majority country of 84 million, split between Europe and Asia, agrees that Russia’s attempt to occupy and control Ukraine has put Turkey in a messy bind.

As one of 30 European and North American members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance, Turkey is inseparable from the West’s effort to stop the war. And if Russia were to attack any NATO member—a prospect that the Ukraine invasion has made gravely real—Turkey would be required to respond with force.

That decades-old obligation has kept Turkey close to the interests of the U.S. and Europe. But in recent years, the country’s increasingly autocratic leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has warmed to Putin, despite their historic rivalry in the region.

The two countries now have extensive ties, including in defense. In 2017, Turkey purchased $2.5 billion worth of missile defense systems from Russia, a move that prompted alarm in Washington and tough U.S. sanctions on Turkey.

Now, some experts believe the West’s ability to stymie Russia’s bloody war could hinge on Turkey’s willingness to help.

“It is hard to imagine success for NATO in this crisis without at least diplomatic support from Turkey,” said James F. Jeffrey, who served as U.S. ambassador to Turkey in the Barack Obama administration.

The view on Turkey’s moves, so far, is mixed. Some argue Erdogan has taken a tougher-than-expected line toward Moscow, while others feel that his government is unhelpfully playing both sides.

Turkey will be at center stage no matter what. On Thursday, the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers met in the resort city of Antalya for their first face-to-face talks since the war began.

Later on Thursday, Biden and Erdogan spoke directly by phone. An official readout from the White House said that the two leaders “discussed their shared concern about Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine.” Biden also “expressed appreciation for Turkey’s efforts to support a diplomatic resolution to the conflict.”

Flake now has a core responsibility in ensuring the Turkish cooperation that U.S. observers say is critical to turning the tide in Ukraine. And according to Jeffrey, he is hardly a figurehead in Ankara—the U.S ambassador is a central player in the protocol-focused Turkish government’s diplomatic operations, giving the diplomat unparalleled space to shape high-level discussions between the countries.

In a statement provided to The Daily Beast, Flake said “my Embassy team and I engage every day with the Turkish government, as well as the Ukrainian Embassy here, to discuss ways in which we can help Ukraine.”

The ambassador had plenty of praise for Turkey’s response to Russia’s invasion, saying that “Turkey has been steadfast in its support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty,” noting in particular the country’s welcoming of Ukrainian refugees.

But Flake also struck the careful note he did in his confirmation hearing, noting Turkey’s “democratic backsliding” and attacks on press freedom, while also referencing the alarm sparked by its acquisition of Russian-made defense systems.

“Members of Congress of both parties share these concerns, and I will keep these issues on the agenda with Turkey, as will Washington,” Flake said. “But we also have tremendous opportunities, to expand our trade and investment ties, to increase people-to-people exchanges, and to work together to resolve regional conflicts.”

To Flake’s admirers, he is more than capable of pulling off the delicate balancing act his job requires. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who embraced Trump when Flake didn’t, told The Daily Beast that his former colleague is “uniquely situated” to navigate the “currents” presented by Turkey’s unique status as a “problematic but valuable NATO ally.”

“He’s the right guy in the right place at the right time,” Graham said.

It’s an unexpected turn for Flake—something he openly acknowledges. “I did not take a traditional path to becoming an ambassador, though I’ve always had a great respect for and interest in diplomacy,” he said in his statement.

The conservative Republican, who served five terms in the U.S. House and one in the Senate, did bring considerable international expertise to the job, just not in Turkey’s neighborhood.

A devout Mormon, Flake completed his missionary service in South Africa and Zimbabwe, and later lived in Namibia. He speaks Afrikaans, the Dutch-based language widely spoken in southern Africa. In the Senate, he chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee’s sub-panel focusing on Africa.

When Biden nominated Flake, Namik Tan, a former Turkish ambassador to Washington, plainly wrote in an op-ed that he “does not have enough experience regarding Turkey and the region.”

“On the other hand,” Tan added, “Flake’s limited experience about Turkey and its neighborhood could help him [make] moves without any prejudices regarding Turkey.”

Defne Arslan, senior director of the Turkey program at the Atlantic Council, a foreign policy think tank, noted that Biden’s appointment of a non-career diplomat came after Erdogan sent a close political ally to Washington.

Speaking from Turkey, she told The Daily Beast that Flake’s selection was “an interesting choice, but… a good choice, I think.”

“It told me that there is a big intention on the U.S. side to put things on track,” Arslan said. “As a political appointee, with a direct line to President Biden, and also with ties to Congress, I think there could be a big role that Ambassador Flake can play.”

In his class of ambassadors, Flake quickly impressed peers with his acumen, despite never having been to Turkey before his appointment. One diplomat specifically cited Flake’s experience as one of the lone Republicans to stand athwart Trump’s populist takeover of the Republican Party as a predicting factor in his future success as an ambassador to a country with its own strongman.

“Any Republican who was willing to stand up to Trump, basically alone, that’s a mark of personal fortitude,” the diplomat said.

Another diplomat pointed to Flake’s membership in the Church of Latter-Day Saints—a community that prides itself in honesty, integrity and service—as having been readily apparent during pre-confirmation training.

“He took it very seriously—he understood the stakes of the work, and the stakes of mistakes if he were to fall short,” they said.

Flake faced light questioning at his hearing, and he was confirmed in the Senate in October by voice vote, a sign of how uncontroversial his appointment was. Russia invaded Ukraine barely a month after Flake arrived in Ankara in January to present his credentials to Erdogan, confronting the newly minted ambassador with an immediate trial by fire.

Western experts consider Erdogan to be personally fond of Putin, despite their proxy standoffs in the region—most notably in Syria, where they have backed opposite sides in that country’s brutal civil war. In 2021, Erdogan publicly defended Putin after Biden called him a “killer,” saying the remark was “not fitting of a U.S. president.”

But Erdogan has nevertheless publicly condemned Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. And Erdogan’s spokesperson said that in a private call on Sunday, the Turkish president planned to tell Putin to put an end to the war.

Beyond that, Turkey invoked its power under a nearly century-old treaty to block Russian warships from traveling through its straits connecting the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea during times of “war,” limiting Putin’s ability to leverage the power of Russia’s naval forces in Ukraine. Turkey has enjoyed its own warm relations with Ukraine, and Kyiv’s military has already put Turkish-made drones to use in strikes against Russian targets.

Asked what success looks like for the West in bringing Turkey’s influence to bear on Russia, Jeffrey, the former U.S. ambassador, said it’s “what you’re seeing.”

“The Turks are seeing that Putin looks weak, and the West looks kick-ass,” he said. “Everyone wants to go with a winner.”

Others are less sure. Aykan Erdemir, a former Turkish member of parliament now with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank, argued Turkey is trying to have it both ways—tailoring its Russia-critical moves to the West while emphasizing its disengagement to Moscow.

Turkey cannot afford to alienate Russia too much, Erdemir explained, because of how heavily the country’s ailing economy depends on Russia. Turkey imports more goods from Russia than from any other country, needs the money brought by Russian tourists, and relies on Russia for energy.

That all helps explain why Erdogan has broken with the U.S. and most other Western countries in refusing to impose sanctions on Russia after it launched the invasion. On top of that, Turkey is the only NATO country left that is open to Russian aircraft, and is now Russia’s most essential air travel link to the rest of the world.

The Biden administration and Flake are offering “generous praise” and “positive messaging toward Ankara,” Erdemir said, calling it “an attempt to encourage Ankara to take the Ukraine war as an opportunity to recalibrate its foreign policy.”

“It sounds like an exciting plan, but it’s easier said than done,” Erdemir said.

In his statement, Flake made clear he is not giving up on bringing Turkey along, saying, “We need to play the long game.” And he indicated he hoped his former colleagues, some of whom are harshly critical of Ankara, might do the same.

It will not be an easy task. That is perhaps fitting for the person who attempted a lonely, doomed campaign to weaken Trump’s hold on the GOP.

“When the Biden Administration approached me about becoming an Ambassador, I said I would be honored, but I wanted to serve somewhere consequential,” Flake said. “Turkey is surely consequential.”

Two years after the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic on 11 March 2022, the developed world’s long-time fixation on the SARS-CoV2 virus, which has killed 6 million people, has suddenly shifted away from health to the war in Ukraine and sharply rising geopolitical tensions.

Meanwhile high-income countries have dropped restrictions as their citizens clamour for a return to normalcy. Low-income countries, including many in Africa, are still encountering resistance to COVID vaccine campaigns.

While African Union countries have been eager to see more technology transfer to the continent to increase medicines and vaccine production– some countries may also be quietly questioning if COVID vaccination should be prioritized over the fight against other deadly disease threats – from cholera to Lassa fever.

And at the same time, as global health leaders point out, the pandemic is not over…. yet.

Some countries in WHO´s Western Pacific region, notably South Korea and Malaysia, are facing a surge in cases.

And a new “recombinant” virus variant, including features both of the deadly Delta variant and the infectious Omicron, has been identified in France. More virus variants could emerge in regions where vaccination rates remain significantly lower than the global average, WHO and other experts have continuously warned.

“This pandemic is not taking a break, despite the fact that we have this war, despite the fact that many countries are facing challenges… Unfortunately, this virus will take opportunities to continue to spread,” said Dr Maria van Kerkhove, WHO’s COVID-19 lead, during Wednesday’s WHO briefing.

Ukraine conflict ‘perfect storm’ for COVID surge

The conflict in Ukraine is likely to lead to another surge in COVID, which will be nearly impossible to track as surveillance systems fall apart, others warn.

The “low levels of vaccination and very low levels of getting booster doses and the social disruption is just a perfect storm for seeing the surge in cases,” said Dr Wafaa El-Sadr, professor of epidemiology and medicine at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, speaking to USA Today.

“It will all be lost in the noise,” said Dr Eric Toner, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security at the Bloomberg School of Public Health. “Assuming that the hospitals are able to even track admission data, there’s going to be a much bigger influx of people with war injuries than there would be COVID patients.”

A surge in deadly tuberculosis could be another element of fallout from the war in Ukraine, WHO and others have warned, given the large wave of migration and the breakdown in routine surveillance and treatment systems. Ukraine, like neighboring Russia, has a high TB burden although it has made significant inroads in the past few years in combating the disease.

Low testing rates also create opportunities for new variants to spread

Speaking in a press briefing on Wednesday two days ahead of the pandemic anniversary date, WHO’s Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus noted that although reported cases and deaths are declining globally, “countries in Asia and the Pacific are facing surges of cases as the virus continues to evolve.

Just as significantly, he noted that ¨we continue to face major obstacles in distributing vaccines, tests and treatments everywhere they are needed.”

He expressed concern that countries were reducing testing, and said that the WHO was recommending that self-testing for COVID 19 should be offered in addition to professionally-administered testing services.

“This recommendation is based on evidence that shows users can reliably and accurately self-test and that self-testing may reduce inequalities in testing access,” said Tedros.

Overall, reduced testing also reduces the ability to track virus trends, including the emergence of new variants.

In Africa, WHO, Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance and the African Union have been working to build stronger COVID vaccine uptake in countries lacking strong health systems, with some success.

However, sources have also have told Health Policy Watch, that some countries are becoming reluctant to aggressively push ahead with COVID vaccination campaigns when they face so many other challenges.

Meanwhile, it remains a question if wealthy donor nations, many of them European, will respond quite as positively to the new GAVI Ask for some $16.8 billion for 2022 to fund vaccine distribution and health system uptake in low-income countries, primarily Africa, now that the Russian attacks on Ukraine have evolved into such a major humanitarian crisis that will also demand billions from donors to address.

Ultimately, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, more so than COVID fatigue, could sabotage the ¨pandemic dividend¨ that WHO and other health agencies might have hoped to have obtained in terms of convincing policymakers to focus more on health investments and in building stronger health systems.

That, despite the fact that as Howard Catton, the head of the International Council of Nurses points out in an op-ed, “health, peace, and prosperity are inseparable.” (see related Health Policy Watch story).

Attempts to return to normalcy amidst rising cases in some regions

Meanwhile, despite rising case rates in Asia as well as in Europe, countries continued to relax their COVID-19 restrictions, with most European countries having dropped “COVID certificate” requirements for entering domestic venues such as restaurants, while states in the United States are dropping mask requirements and other restrictions .

Ireland and Hungary -this week joined Iceland, Norway, and Slovenia in lifting all of their COVID-19 restrictions.

“From March 6, 2022, travelers to Ireland are not required to show proof of vaccination, proof of recovery, or a negative PCR test result upon arrival. There are no post-arrival testing or quarantine requirements for travelers to Ireland,” the statement of the Irish authorities reads.

Similar to Ireland, the Hungarian authorities revealed that all incoming travelers, including those not vaccinated or recovered from the virus, are now permitted entry without testing rules.

“It is possible to enter the territory of Hungary by public road, railway, water, and air traffic – regardless of citizenship and protection against the coronavirus,” the Hungarian authorities stated.

This followed a major relaxation of restrictions in most other countries of the European Union as well as the United States and the United Kingdom several weeks ago.

“Today is not the day we can declare victory over COVID because this virus is not going away,” UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on 21 February, when he announced an end to England’s remaining legal curbs and most free testing.

The UK announcement came after Johnson said the nation had passed the peak of Omicron, and could now complete the “transition back to normality” – although since then cases in the UK have begun to rise again.

Many states in the US also have decided to lift mask requirements and other restrictions, with California becoming the first state to shift to an “endemic” approach to the coronavirus.

However, US President Biden vowed, in his State of the Union address, to never give up the fight against COVID-10.

“I know some are talking about living with COVID-19,” the president said. “But tonight, I say that we never will just accept living with COVID-19.”

Further to the east, South Korea, which has recently been reporting more than 100,000 new cases a day, has started to ask people who test positive for COVID to look after themselves at home, so the country can redirect resources to the most vulnerable. As of 10 March, the country has reported 327,549 new cases.

Pandemic restrictions – which include a six-person cap on private gatherings, a seven-day quarantine for international arrivals, mask mandates in public spaces, and vaccine passes for a range of businesses – will remain in place until at least 13 March.

Japan has, however, announced that it is easing border restrictions to allow more international students and visa holders in the country beginning in March, while cases decline.

One of the most COVID-restrictive countries, Australia opened up its borders to international visitors for the first time in nearly two years. Travelers must still show proof of full vaccination to enter Australia without having to quarantine in a hotel, and they must provide a negative coronavirus test that was taken within 24 hours of departure.

. COVID-19 Delta-Omicron ‘recombinant’ in Europe

Meanwhile, Dr Maria van Kerkhove said that a COVID-19 “recombinant” made up of “Delta AY.4 and Omicron VA.1” had been identified in France, the Netherlands and Denmark.

“The recombinant is something that is expected given the intense amount of circulation that we saw with both Omicron and Delta”, and that both were circulating at high levels in Europe at the same time, said van Kerkhove.

“There’s very good surveillance in many countries right now. And given the sheer number of changes and mutations within Omicron, it was much easier for researchers, scientists, public health professionals, people who are studying the genome to be able to detect these recombinants.

“We have not seen any change in the epidemiology with this recombinant. We haven’t seen any change in severity. But there are many studies that are underway.

The evidence for the Delta-Omicron recombinant virus had been shared by the France-based NGO Institut Pasteur via the research consortium Global Initiative for Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID). Additional investigation and analysis is needed to determine if the recombinant originates from a single common ancestor, or multiple similar recombination events.

Said WHO Chief Scientist Soumya Swaminathan, in a tweet: “We have known that recombinant events can occur, in humans or animals, with multiple circulating variations of SARS-CoV-2. Need to wait for experiments to determine the properties of this virus. Importance of sequencing, analytics, and rapid data sharing as we deal with this pandemic.”

7,490def92-cafd-4201-b361-3302c097cf68,[],,"Earlier declarations of friendship towards Putin could endanger Viktor Orbán’s prospects in the election. However, no one should underestimate him.

Hungarian government under Prime Minister Orbán has expressed itself clearly against any arms shipments to Ukraine through the country. These actions fit into the picture of the inseparable friendship that connects Orbán to Putin for a long time now, and that has lead the Western intelligence to consider him as a certain security risk within NATO.

But on April 3, the Hungarian parliamentary elections will take place with the opposition being united in an alliance for the first time, thus having a good chance of winning the elections. And right here, Orbán's carefully cultivated Russophilia represents a possible risk for him. For Hungarians are by no means as anti-Western as it might seem keeping in mind Orbán's permanent rule. In a poll taken at the end of last year, 80% of Hungarians supported the country's NATO membership. Even 78% expressed themselves in favour of the EU membership. That is even one percent more than among the otherwise EU-friendly Estonians. And just as much as in Austria.

Until now, Orbán's friendship with Putin and his frequent anti-European rhetoric has never hurt him in terms of the electoral results, since this issue was not so much relevant for most Hungarians. However, since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, this is definitely no longer the case. On the contrary, Orbán's proximity to Putin could become a problem for him.

Cult of Victimhood over Trianon This is a question of strategy. How does Orbán counter all of this? He decided for a time-tested strategy. The refusal to allow Hungary to be a transit country for arms shipments is not linked to any declaration of loyalty to Putin and Russia. His government even supports the negotiations regarding the Ukrainian entry into the European Union.

The focus is placed on the protection of Hungary. For years, Orbán has seen himself as the protector of all Hungarians outside the Hungarian territory as well. There are many of them, indeed. Orbán has always pursued a historical perspective in his politics, which emphasized the division of Hungary after the war with Romania and Czechoslovakia in 1919, which resulted in the 1920 Peace of Trianon, when the former 21 million country shrank into a country of just under 8 million inhabitants – the rest living in other countries. The shame from the past is still present and Orbán uses it to celebrate a patriotic cult of victimhood, thus legitimizing his political actions.

This is where Orbán adapts his current politics. In the Transcarpathian area in Ukraine, there lives a significant Hungarian minority of around 156,000 people, who make up 12.1% of the population there. Orbán has always played a role of an administrator for this minority and has often entered into conflict with the Ukrainian government, for example because of the Hungarian language teaching in Ukraine in 2018. Always with a clear intention: for in 2010 Orbán gave Hungarians living abroad the right to participate in the elections in Hungary itself. It paid off: in 2014, around 95% of them voted for Orbán's Fidesz party. In 2018, around 380,000 Hungarian voters living in Ukraine, Slovakia, Romania and other countries had participated in the election after all: they mainly voted for Orbán as well.

Harmed, But Not to Be Underestimated Now, when Orbán publicly opposes the transit of weapons through his country by arguing that all of this is in order to protect the Transcarpathian Hungarians from the threat of war, the votes for him are secured there. Yet, it is likely that most voters in Hungary will see Orbán's argumentation as a distraction from his close political ties to Putin and a distraction from the close interconnection of Orbán's oligarchic environment to Putin's oligarchic environment. However, it is still a clever move, because the protection of Hungarians living abroad is actually mostly seen as a legitimate concern. Another important gain in the election could also represent the announcement of the Hungarian provision of humanitarian aid to Ukraine on an unprecedented scale of 600 million forints (approx. 1.54 million euros), which is mostly focused on the Transcarpathian area (with many Hungarians to protect). Of course, the probability that Orbán's stance on Ukraine and especially Russia will have a negative impact in this election still stands. Although his distraction manoeuvre fits into Orbán's successful (historical) narrative, it originated out of necessity. People do not forget past declarations of friendship towards Putin that quickly. Nevertheless, the example also shows that the opposition, whose chances are better than ever since 2010, cannot become careless. Orbán's strategic and political skills should not be underestimated.
