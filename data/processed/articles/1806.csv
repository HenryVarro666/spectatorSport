According to Russian media, four personnel were injured as a consequence of one explosion.

It then retracted its report.

Twitter user @JimmySecUK, who covers security, tweeted an article from Russia’s state-owned TASS news agency that described the explosion’s impact.

“Four personnel were wounded when a shell hit a military base in the Belgorod area,” he translated.

Around 10 minutes later, he posted: “TASS have deleted the tweet above, presumably because admitting to a successful strike on Russian territory is slightly embarrassing.”",https://www.bolnews.com/international/2022/04/a-massive-explosion-shocks-russia-as-sparks-fly-across-the-border-with-ukraine-injuring-troops-3/

The situation in the city is tense, but people are called for calm

Panic in Belgorod due to “pop” in the sky / Photo: Collage: Today

In Russian Belgorod, located near the border with Ukraine, locals observed an explosion in the sky. Under Belgorod began to dig trenches and trenches. Local authorities are calling it “earthworks” and urging people to remain calm. In addition, all schools in the city received information about mining.

On April 6, the Trukha Telegram channel published a photo of an explosion in the sky over Belgorod.

“In Belgorod, the Russian Federation, they report another “pop” in the sky. Also today, all schools in the city were “mined,” the message says.

The mayor of Belgorod Anton Ivanov said that on Wednesday morning a message was received about the mining of all schools in the city and region.

“Special services are checking buildings, students and staff are being transferred to a safe place. I ask you all to remain calm. We understand that this is part of the information pressure on the region. At the request of parents, children can be sent home today,” Ivanov was quoted as saying by the Zhest Belgorod Telegram channel. “.

In addition, in the Shebekinsky urban district near Belgorod, the digging of trenches and trenches began. ⠀

The head of the district, Vladimir Zhdanov, said that they were doing this at his request:

“I understand that earthworks on the territory of our municipality are of concern. Believe me, this is at our request. As a military man, I always play it safe. And today, I assure you, nothing threatens the security of our territory, as before “.

The situation in Belgorod

On April 1, Russian media reported that a projectile allegedly “fired from Ukraine” fell in the Belgorod region. As a result of the explosion, a fire broke out at the oil depot, which destroyed several oil tanks.

The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine denied the statement of the Russian Federation and stated that our defenders had nothing to do with the emergency in Belgorod. Also, high-ranking officials named two probable reasons for undermining the tank farm.

“We suspect that the explosion of an oil depot in Russian Belgorod occurred due to the carelessness of the occupiers or in order to hide someone’s corruption,” the Defense Ministry said.

According to our military, they have no information that units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were involved in the explosion.",https://globalhappenings.com/top-global-news/145000.html
5,3199a756-2799-4bc3-9a10-61b3b4f455e4,[],,"It happened at around six o'clock on Sunday morning. At least ten explosions shook the windows of houses, waking up half the city. Some of these detonations were the result of Ukrainian anti-aircraft artillery, which managed to shoot down Kalibr-type missiles launched from Russian ships stationed in the Black Sea. But the shells that did manage to hit the fuel depots and the Odessa refinery.

The roar of the explosions was followed by a fire that could not be extinguished all day, and a huge column of smoke that dyed the sky black.

Vladimir Putin justified the attack on the grounds that the Ukrainian army was being supplied by the refinery. But the truth is that a few days earlier a video had gone viral showing two MI-24 helicopters - allegedly Ukrainian - bombing eight fuel depots in the Russian city of Belgorod, located some 40 kilometres from the border with the Donbas.

The Ukrainian government denied responsibility for the attack on Russian soil. But it was not enough to prevent a black Sunday in Odessa.

Second bombardment of the Pearl of the Black Sea

This port city had been largely unscathed by Russian offensives since the war began in Ukraine. It had received only one attack to date. That was on 21 March, when another naval attack blew up several houses in a quiet residential neighbourhood on the city's southern beachfront.

María Senovilla - Anatoli was one of those injured in the first shelling in Odessa, in a residential area in the south of the city.

It was a demonstrative, short-range, low-firepower artillery attack. Most of the salvos launched by Putin's navy fell into the water, four rockets hit, and there was only material damage. But it was enough to overwhelm a city that until recently was a favourite holiday resort for Russians (those who can afford to go to spas, of course).

The Russian-speaking southeast of Ukraine, whose cities were founded by Catalina the Great, still does not understand why its neighbours are preying on a civilian population with whom they shared so much culturally.

""Where are the military targets?""

Like the attack on the refinery, the first shelling of Odessa also took place at the stroke of six in the morning. This time there was no justification from the Kremlin, even though the rockets hit a tourist area known as Battery 411.

There, the more modest houses, with their uralite roofs covering their peaceful terraces, mingled with larger, more luxurious ones. All facing the sea. All inhabited by civilians, some of whom asked us, the international press who came to the site a few hours after the bombing, ""Where were the military targets? Do you see any among our houses?""

There were no fatalities, but several neighbours were injured with cuts caused by window panes that were blown out by the explosion. ""They had to pull them out of my stomach with tweezers,"" said Anatoli, also showing the wounds on his hand. His house was one of the worst affected. It was practically reduced to rubble.

María Senovilla - Anatoli's house was practically reduced to rubble by the naval attack on a residential area in the district known as Battery 411 in the south of the city.

""It all happened in a second,"" said Anatoli's wife Elena. She was still in shock, sitting on a green deck chair in the rubble, smoking one cigarette after another.

The couple had lived in the house for 15 years, where they were happy looking out to sea in retirement. It is very difficult to imagine what they felt at that moment, with their home in pieces. But Anatoli assured us before saying goodbye that, when everything is over, he will rebuild it with his own hands. He is 81 years old.

Putin's new strategy on the southern front

Just when the shelling of the beach houses seemed to be forgotten, along comes this new blow. The Odessa refinery becomes a fireball, and the Odessa people's confidence in diplomatic negotiations burns along with the oil that was stored in these fuel depots.

A week earlier, Putin had announced at the negotiating table that he was going to withdraw his troops in order to concentrate the war in the Donbas region in the east of the country. However, that same day he intensified shelling in southern cities such as Mikolaiv, the closest front line to Odessa, and where the Ukrainian armed forces are holding back the Russian advance on the ground.

María Senovilla - Civilian buildings in Mikolaiv, next to the city's bus station, after one of the almost daily bombardments of the city since the start of the war in Ukraine.

Mikolaiv has been shelled almost daily since 24 February. The Russian army uses MSLR-type multiple rocket launchers and cluster bombs, which have been banned since 2010 by an international treaty ratified by almost all countries except Russia, the United States and China, among others.

Speaking to Atalayar, the mayor of Mikolaiv, Alexander Senkevich, said that ""35% of the civilian population has fled the city"". He also acknowledges that they are suffering major problems with the electricity supply because of the constant shelling. ""More than a thousand workers are working every day to rebuild the damaged infrastructure, but there are still 50,000 people without electricity in the area closest to Kherson"".

""When we don't come under fire during the day, it falls at night,"" continues the mayor of Mikolaiv, ""and the Russians have tried to cross the Bug River several times, without success,"" he adds, explaining how the siege of this southern Ukrainian frontline town is going despite Putin's promises to withdraw to the Donbas.

Six weeks of war with no end in sight

The day after the attack on the refinery, the city of Odessa dawned again with the sound of anti-aircraft alarms echoing throughout the neighbourhoods. But for the moment, this soundtrack is not enough to deter the inhabitants, who have once again raised the shutters of their shops and gone about their business. They are not prepared to stop resisting.

On the other hand, 130 kilometres away in the town of Mikolaiv, the black Sunday was followed by a bloody Monday. One of the bloodiest bombings to date took place there, killing 10 people, including a child, and wounding more than 60. All of them civilians who were in the street or shopping in supermarkets and shops. Among the buildings affected were the Regional Clinical Hospital, the Centre for Disease Prevention and even an orphanage.

Criminal proceedings have already been initiated at the Regional Prosecutor's Office for ""violating the laws and customs of war"" (Part 1 of Article 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). But actions on paper do not seem to be enough to make progress towards ending the war.",https://atalayar.com/en/content/black-sunday-odessa
