Air India is sending two flights at 2 am on Saturday to airlift the Indian citizens from Ukraine via Bucharest.

The Indian evacuation teams have reached the Romanian borders, which is roughly 12 hours drive from Ukrainian capital Kyiv. With the airspace closed for civilian flights, the Indian nationals will be boarding flights at Bucharest to return home safely.



Russia-Ukraine crisis LIVE coverage

Meanwhile, several Indian nationals have taken refuge in the Indian embassy in Kyiv. There were reports of shelling around the embassy premises, but no damage has been done.

Ever since Vladimir Putin's forces invaded Ukraine, the Indian government has been on its toes. The Ministry of External Affairs set up a 24x7 control room in the national capital to monitor the entire evacuation process.

The Indian embassy in Kyiv has been issuing advisories to the citizens, mostly comprising students to stay calm wherever they were, assuring them of working on an evacuation arrangement via alternative route.

Add to this, the embassy had also advised the Indian nationals to take shelter in the nearest bomb shelter or bunkers in case of shelling in the vicinity.

The external affairs ministry has also shared contact details of officials who can be approached by Indian citizens after cross the Ukrainian border with respective countries. . As flights have been suspended, entering these countries through land route by crossing the border remains the best option for Indians who want to leave Ukraine now.

On Thursday, MoS external affairs V Muraleedharan had assured families of stranded Indians that efforts were on a war-footing to bring their near and dear ones from the conflict-hit eastern European nation.

""The MEA is taking steps to bring back about 18,000 Indians including students from Ukraine. As the air space in Ukraine is closed, alternative arrangements are being made for the evacuation of Indian nationals. The central government will ensure the safety of all Indians,"" the minister had said.

Remember, the Indian embassy in Kyiv in its advisory issued on February 15 had urged all Indians to leave Ukraine as soon as possible.

""All Indian students should leave Ukraine in view of the escalating military tension with Russia. In view of the uncertainties of the current situation in Ukraine, Indian nationals in Ukraine, particularly students whose stay is not essential may consider leaving temporarily,"" the embassy had said.

Govt. has asked all airlines to help in evacuation efforts

Air India will start evacuation flights to countries bordering Ukraine from Saturday even as the government has requested other airlines to join the ""operation"" to bring back Indians trying to flee the war-torn country.

Air India will operate a flight each to Bucharest and Budapest as special government charter flights, the airline tweeted late on Friday evening.

The Ministry of Civil Aviation has also written to all airlines requesting them to consider starting flights to countries with a land border with Ukraine, an official said.

Embassy advisory

The Indian Embassy in Ukraine issued an advisory informing Indian nationals that it was working to establish evacuation routes from Romania and Hungary. Later, in an update through its Twitter handle, the embassy said more than 470 students were ready to exit Ukraine and enter Romania.

Air India had earlier this week operated a flight to Ukraine and brought back 242 Indians. On Thursday, its second repatriation flight to Kyiv was forced to turn back mid-way after Ukraine closed its airspace for civilian flights following Russia's ""military operation"".

Officials of the Ministry of Civil Aviation said Air India's flights were based on a ""request, and not a directive"" since it was now a private carrier owned by Tata Sons. Last week, the Ministry wrote to all airlines asking them to start flights to Ukraine, and ""only Air India and SpiceJet gave a commitment,"" a Ministry official said. Though Air India had already announced its plan to operate three flights to Kyiv, and SpiceJet was also ready to start flights in the days to come, the shutting down of Ukrainian airspace put paid to those plans.

According to sources, MEA Camp Offices are now operational in Lviv and Chernivtsi towns in western Ukraine. Additional Russian speaking officials are being sent to these Camp Offices.

Key considerations

Officials said Air India's wide-body planes such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner that flew to Kyiv on Tuesday as well as pilots experienced in flying to conflict zones were also important considerations. The airline most recently evacuated Indians from Wuhan in March 2020 due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and has also rescued Indians during the conflict in Libya in 2014, and from Egypt in 2011. Its biggest evacuation was from Kuwait, which was attacked by Iraq in 1990, when nearly 488 flights were operated to rescue 1,70,00 Indians over a period of two months. This is also known as the world's largest air evacuation.

Asked whether Air India would be paid for the evacuation flights, an official said there was “no clarity” on the issue. The Ministry of External Affairs has said the cost of such flights will be completely borne by the Government of India. A senior official of the Ministry of Civil Aviation also contended that airfares for flights from Kyiv were exorbitant and said, “Business class fare was ₹1.1 lakh and economy class fare was at ₹56,000”. Air India’s Kyiv flight was a commercial flight.

A Ministry of Civil Aviation official said that while the Aircraft Act, 1934 empowers the government to order airlines to start flights in an emergency situation, it was meant for use within a ""domestic framework"", i.e. for domestic flights. However, this provision ""has never been invoked"".

To a question whether there should be bidding among different airlines for such evacuation flights since Air India is now a private carrier, an official said this was not a situation where different airlines were vying to fly but one where the government was making a request.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/russia-ukraine-crisis-air-india-planning-to-operate-two-flights-to-bucharest-to-evacuate-indians-stranded-in-ukraine/article65084103.ece

Sumy, located near the Russian border and around 350 km east of Ukrainian capital Kyiv, has seen heavy fighting since the invasion. Today, at least nine people, including two children, died in an air strike in the city.

The students have been waiting for evacuation for days. On Saturday, unable to cope any longer with the bitter cold, depleting food and water supplies, the students shared videos saying they have decided to begin the risky journey to the Russian border 50 km away.

But they were dissuaded by the government, which contacted them and asked that they ""avoid unnecessary risks"".

A plan to evacuate them yesterday fell through as Ukraine rejected a Russian plan for a humanitarian corridor to Russia and Belarus.

More than 600 Indian students are currently stranded in a university located in Sumy, a city in north-eastern Ukraine, hoping that they will soon be evacuated as ""continuous firing and bombing"" by the Russian forces has left them completely terrified, one of the students said.

Not a single Indian student from Sumy State University, located close to the Russian border has been evacuated so far, Viraj Walde, who hails from Nagpur in Maharashtra and who is currently studying in the fourth year medical course in that university, told PTI over phone on Wednesday.

""More than 600 Indian students are stuck here in Sumy university. The embassy has neither evacuated us nor given any assurance to that effect. Since the last five days, there has been continuous firing, shelling and bombing in the city,"" he said. Their final exams were about to start from March 15, he said. ""Before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, temporary advisories were given to the students and the university informed us that those having exams can wait. Hence, we waited for the exams to start,"" Mr Walde added.

""But now, the students are terrified and their mental state is deteriorating. Food and drinking water supplies are depleting. Even the banks and ATMs are running out of cash,"" he said.

The embassy has sent advisories to students, telling them to use only the western border of Ukraine and reach the neighbouring countries of Poland, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Moldova. But since Sumy city is located in the north-eastern part of Ukraine, it is impossible for them to travel all the way to the western part in the prevailing situation, he said.

""The border in Ukraine's western part is located almost 1,500 kms away from Sumy, whereas the Russian border is just 50 kms away. The railway station in Sumy has also been closed due to bombing, and traveling via road is like committing suicide since Russian and Ukrainian forces are fighting against each other at such places,"" he added.

But on Thursday, the US aviation regulator Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said radio altimeters fitted in certain types of aircraft, including B777, will not be affected by 5G services.

However, a number of jurisdictions and nations like Hong Kong and Germany have suspended flights with India over Covid-19 cases and schedules respectively. Special international flights have been operating under the Vande Bharat Mission since May and under bilateral air bubble pacts signed with various countries since July.

What is an air bubble/travel bubble?

Aimed at restarting commercial passenger services, air bubbles are temporary reciprocal arrangements between two countries that allow international passenger flights to fly passengers either way without any restrictions. This helps in averting a host of quarantine and Covid-19 testing rules in arrival destinations. This type of arrangement is established between two countries that perceive each other to be safe.

It is different from repatriation flights, which are only one way and the passengers have to register themselves with the embassy to board such flights.

Which countries does India have air bubble arrangements with?

Currently, India has air bubble arrangements with 18 countries. These are the US, the UK, Germany, France, the UAE, Maldives, Canada, Japan, Bahrain, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Qatar, Iraq, Oman, Bhutan, Kenya, Bangladesh and Ukraine.

Bangladesh is set to resume flights to India from October 28. Under the air bubble arrangement, three Bangladeshi carriers – Biman Bangladeshi Airlines, US-Bangla Airlines and Novo Air – would initially operate 28 flights a week, while five Indian airlines — Air India, IndiGo, SpiceJet, Vistara and GoAir — would operate 28 flights a week between the two countries, The Daily Star reported. Initially, around 5,000 passengers from both the countries would be able to fly each week.

As per the arrangement with the United States, Air India has added thrice-a-week flights between Delhi and Newark. The airline is also operating flights between London and Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Kochi and Goa.

Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri has also said India was negotiating with 13 other countries to establish air bubble arrangements. These countries include Italy, New Zealand, Australia, Israel, Kenya, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand.

In addition to this, Indian carriers are also operating a few flights under Vande Bharat Mission that are carrying stranded people from other nations to India. Till October 16, 6,987 repatriation flights were operated by the Air India Group under the Vande Bharat Mission, ferrying over 9.10 lakh passengers, according to the Civil Aviation Ministry.

Which countries have suspended/restricted flights from India?

Hong Kong has banned Air India and Vistara flights from October 17 to 30 after a few passengers on their flights tested positive for Covid-19 upon arrival. This is the third time that Air India flights from India have been banned by Hong Kong. Previous bans were during September 20-October 3 and August 18-August 31.

India and Germany recently had a fallout over the number of flights being allowed, leading to suspension of the air bubble arrangement between the two countries. However, services are set to resume from October 26, with Air India set to operate flights till March 28, 2021, the carrier said in a tweet.

On October 2, Air India announced cancellation of its flights to Frankfurt till October 14 after Germany withdrew its approval granted to the airline to operate under the air bubble arrangement. This was preceded by the Indian side asking Lufthansa to curtail its schedule, which led to the German airline cancelling its flights to India till October 20.

Dubai had also banned Air India flights after the airline carried Covid-19 positive passengers on two different occasions. Even though Dubai has now allowed flights to resume from India, it has named four Indian labs whose Covid-19 test results won’t be considered valid. The authorities have asked Air India Express to reject negative RT-PCR test reports of these labs — Suryam Lab, Jaipur; Microhealth lab, Kerala; Dr P Bhasin Pathlabs (P) Ltd in Delhi and Noble Diagnostic Centre, also in Delhi.

Last month, Saudi Arabia had banned flights to and from India amid a surge in coronavirus cases but later allowed outbound passenger flights to India under the Vande Bharat mission.

What is the situation on the domestic front?

With India in the peak festival season, Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri last week said airlines might be permitted to operate flights up to 75 per cent of their pre-Covid schedule if the passenger numbers continue to remain healthy. This comes after the government on September 2 allowed domestic airlines to operate up to 60 per cent of their pre-Covid services.

Domestic passenger services resumed from May 25 following a gap of two months due to a stringent Covid-19 lockdown.

Air India will operate more flights on Saturday to Bucharest and Hungarian capital Budapest to evacuate Indians stranded in Ukraine.

The Ukrainian airspace has been closed for civil aircraft operations since February 24 morning and therefore, the evacuation flights are operating out of Bucharest and Budapest.

Around 20,000 Indians, mainly students, are currently stranded in Ukraine, the officials said.

Prior to the closure of the Ukrainian airspace, Air India had operated a flight to Ukraine's capital Kyiv on February 22 that brought 240 people back to India.

It had planned to operate two more flights on February 24 and February 26 but could not as the Russian offensive began on February 24 and the Ukrainian airspace was consequently shut down.

Air India said on Twitter on Friday night that it will be operating flights on B787 aircraft from Delhi and Mumbai to Bucharest and Budapest on Saturday as special government charter flights to fly back stranded Indian citizens.

The Indian embassy in Ukraine on Friday said it is working to establish evacuation routes from Romania and Hungary.

At present, teams are getting in place at the following check points: Chop-Zahony Hungarian border near Uzhhorod, Porubne-Siret Romanian border near Chernivtsi, it said.

Indian nationals, especially students, living closest to these border checkpoints are advised to depart in an organised manner in coordination with teams from the Ministry of External Affairs to actualise this option, the embassy said.

Once the above-mentioned routes are operational, the Indian nationals travelling on their own would be advised to proceed to the border checkpoints, it noted.

The embassy advised Indian travellers to carry their passports, cash (preferably in US dollars), other essential items and COVID-19 vaccination certificates to the border checkpoints.

Print out Indian flag and paste prominently on vehicles and buses while travelling, it said.

The distance between Kyiv and the Romanian border checkpoint is approximately 600 kilometres and it takes anywhere between eight-and-a-half hours to 11 hours to cover it by road.

Bucharest is located approximately 500 kilometres from the Romanian border checkpoint and it takes anywhere between seven to nine hours by road.

The distance between Kyiv and the Hungarian border checkpoint is around 820 kilometres and it takes 12-13 hours by road

'Indians in Ukraine should stay calm'

Indian nationals stuck in Ukraine should stay calm and remain wherever they are residing, Russian diplomatic sources said on Friday.

The sources said President Vladimir Putin conveyed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday night that the Russian military operation in Ukraine does not represent any threat to the civilian population.

""The Indian nationals should stay calm and not panic. They should stay wherever they are residing,"" said a Russian diplomatic source.

In his telephonic conversation with Putin, the prime minister ""sensitised"" him about concerns over the safety of the Indian citizens in Ukraine and conveyed that India attaches the highest priority to their safe exit and return home, according to an official statement.

A Russian readout said the President of Russia said that ""necessary instructions would be given"".

The sources said Russia will definitely extend assistance to India for the evacuation of its citizens from Ukraine if it receives any specific request.

India was looking at evacuating its nationals through Ukraine's land borders with Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Romania as the Ukrainian government closed the country's airspace following the Russian military offensive.
