The latest: The weeks-long resistance in besieged Mariupol appeared to be cracking as Russian forces moved closer to capturing the seaside port city in southeastern Ukraine, with a Russian-imposed deadline for Ukrainian forces in the city to surrender passing early Sunday local time. Meanwhile, officials in the capital Kyiv and the western city of Lviv reported explosions Saturday. Moscow has withdrawn its forces from those regions to focus on eastern Ukraine, but airstrikes have continued.

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

How you can help: Here are ways those in the U.S. can help support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.

In the wake of nuclear threats from North Korea and Russia, NPR's Ayesha Rascoe talks about the future of deterrence with Ankit Panda of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has shaken assumptions that have guided international relations for the last three decades. Nonproliferation, the movement to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, became the name of the game in the post-Cold War era. But this month, we've seen Russian President Vladimir Putin threaten nuclear warfare and North Korea test a new intercontinental missile last week. That's leaving many countries wondering if it's really a good idea to give up having nuclear weapons. So does disarmament have a chance moving forward? Joining us now is Ankit Panda. He's the Stanton Senior Fellow in the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Good morning.

ANKIT PANDA: Thank you so much for having me.

RASCOE: I want to start with, like, how does the world continue to push for nonproliferation at a time where you have international actors who seem to be benefiting or, at the very least, surviving thanks to having nuclear weapons?

PANDA: I think, you know, that's the question that the nonproliferation policy community has been wrangling with since the Cold War. And I'd actually, you know, question that assumption that, you know, is Vladimir Putin thriving? Is Kim Jong Un thriving despite the nuclear threats?

RASCOE: Well, surviving. Oh yeah, surviving. Not - maybe not thriving but surviving.

PANDA: But so I think a lot of national leaders have greater aspirations than just survival. And so, you know, for the United States, our nonproliferation policy has gone down many folds, right? So the Non-Proliferation Treaty is one of the most successful treaties we have in the international system. President Kennedy worried in the '60s that we'd be entering a world by the end of the 20th century with 20, 30 countries with nuclear weapons. Fortunately, we just have nine, and the NPT is a really big part of that. But we also have alliances. One of the best tools in our nonproliferation toolkit is the fact that we tell our friends in Europe and East Asia, Japan, Korea, Australia - that, you know, their leaders should rest easy at night because American nuclear weapons are there as the ultimate backstop for their national defense.

RASCOE: You mentioned the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Like, why was it so successful in the past?

PANDA: Yeah, so, you know, two things on why the NPT was so successful - I think the really big one is that during the Cold War, even as the United States and the Soviet Union were pointing thousands of nuclear weapons at each other, they agreed that it would be really bad for other countries to get nuclear weapons. And then the Soviet Union collapsed. And in the 1990s, when the Russian Federation's power was really diminished, the so-called nuclear weapon states - the United States, Russia, China, France and the United Kingdom - were able to extend the NPT indefinitely. You know, the world is changing today, but the conditions under which the NPT was built and the conditions under which it was extended indefinitely I think were particularly unique.

RASCOE: You mentioned other countries without nuclear weapons. Do you think that some countries at this moment may be looking at the situation in Ukraine and say, do we need to make some changes if we want to avoid Ukraine's fate? Or do you think that they may be making different calculations?

PANDA: Even if a world leader were to decide, hey, these things are actually great - maybe if we had nuclear weapons, you know, nobody can invade us, there would be a lot of costs associated with that, not just the financial costs of building the bomb but operating the bomb, not suffering economic sanctions, not becoming a pariah state. All of these things, I think, are very difficult for national leaders to overlook in the decision to build nuclear weapons. I mean, even Ukraine - I mean, now everybody knows that the Ukrainians returned the Soviet weapons that were on their territory to the Russian Federation. But the Ukrainians never controlled those weapons, right? They could have physically cracked those weapons open and taken the uranium and the plutonium out and build their own weapons. But that would have been a disastrous decision for a country that was newly independent after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The Ukrainians decided that they were going to take security guarantees instead and become a member of the global community in good standing. And lo and behold, here we are now in 2022 with those security guarantees really torn up, I mean, really just based on the decision of one man - Vladimir Putin.

RASCOE: So taking a step back, like, how do you see the future of nonproliferation after the invasion of Ukraine? Like, is this a turning point?

PANDA: You know, I think that's, again, very much a question that's looming on the minds of many of us who work in this field. The biggest short-term concern is Iran. The Iran deal is on the cusp of being restored, although we've seen a lot of last-minute doldrums there. And if that deal doesn't get restored, I think the chances of Iran potentially pursuing a nuclear weapon are quite likely. And then you look to Saudi Arabia, where the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has basically - he said this in public interviews - that if Iran acquires a nuclear weapon, Saudi Arabia will look to do the same. The other thing that I'm concerned about is, you know, the return of an America First foreign policy here in the United States. You know, for 70 years, we had American presidents that agreed that our allies were worth supporting and that American-extended deterrence was a force for good in the world. That changed in 2016. And I think the Trump presidency really got many of our partners who relied on the American nuclear deterrent as the ultimate backstop in their own national defense strategies just becoming a lot more concerned.

RASCOE: That's Ankit Panda of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Thanks for being with us today.

PANDA: Thanks a lot, Ayesha. Great to talk to you.

2,2a6ed4c2-ee5b-49db-90f5-10bff60160d3,[],2022-03-27 22:58:43+05:30,"The Russian invasion on Ukraine entered its 32nd day on Sunday, even as negotiation talks between the two sides so far have not yielded fruitful results. The delegations have now decided to meet for the next in-person talks between March 28 and 30 in Turkey, a Ukraine negotiator and politician David Arakhamia informed on Facebook earlier in the day.

Russia's lead negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, confirmed Turkey as the location for the next peace talks. However, he said the negotiation would start on Tuesday (March 29) and end Wednesday (March 30).

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has said that an understanding on four of six negotiating points have been reached between the two former Soviet neighbours - Ukraine not pursuing North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) membership, use of Russian language in Ukraine, disarmament and security guarantees. However, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said that there was “no consensus” on key points with Russia.

This development comes as Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused the West of cowardice and not having enough courage to face Russia. In a video address earlier in the day, the comedian-turned-president said, ""If only those who have been thinking for 31 days on how to hand over dozens of jets and tanks had 1% of their courage.” Zelenskyy has been consistently urging the West to provide Ukraine with fighter jets and tanks.

Referring to the besieged city of Mariupol that has borne the brunt of Russian missiles, with repeated attempts for humanitarian corridor for the city failing due to trading blames between the two countries, Zelenskyy said the “determination, heroism and firmness” of the “defenders” are “astonishing”.

“I've talked to the defenders of Mariupol today. I'm in constant contact with them,” the Ukrainian president added.

Two humanitarian corridors were agreed between Russia and Ukraine earlier in the day, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in a video statement.

Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden's fiery verbal attack on his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin has triggered a barrage of reactions. On Saturday, during his visit to Polish capital Warsaw, Biden called Putin a “butcher” after he met Ukrainian refugees there. Later, he called for the removal of the Russian president from power. “For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power,” Biden said during his speech.

French President Emmanuel Macron distanced himself from Biden's remarks - though he termed the US as a vital ally, saying the focus should be on putting an end to the war and not “escalating” the situation “either in words or action”.

The separatist Luhansk People's Republic in eastern Ukraine, partly backed by Russia, said earlier in the day that it could hold a referendum soon to join the country, local leader Leonid Pasechnik said as per Reuters.

This comes after the Russian military on Friday said its focus now is on “complete liberation” of the Donbas region. The move could be seen following Russian troops failing to make adequate territorial gains in Ukraine due to the latter's stiff resistance.

3,2a6ed4c2-ee5b-49db-90f5-10bff60160d3,[],2022-03-28 20:09:49+00:00,"President Volodymyr Zelensky’s willingness to drop the pursuit of Ukraine’s Nato membership removes one of the “purported grounds for war”, ahead of key peace talks in Turkey on Tuesday, an expert says.

Marc Weller, former UN mediation expert, said renouncing Nato membership is “not really a very substantive concession” but is symbolic and could make it more difficult for Moscow to resist calls for a ceasefire in the ongoing conflict.

“The offer is hedged. Instead of Nato membership, Ukraine is demanding more effective security guarantees than those offered in the ill-faded Budapest Memorandum of 1994. Russia had pledged never to use force against Ukraine in that document,” said Mr Weller, who is also professor of international law at the University of Cambridge and.

“Also, the Kremlin justified its war in part with reference to the supposed encirclement of Russia by Nato. In removing the Nato issue from the equation, Ukraine is also removing one of the purported grounds for war, making it more difficult to resist the calls for a ceasefire.

“And President Zelensky’s first priority must be to end the violence, given the immense suffering of the population.”

Ukrainian officials have sought to downplay the significance of the peace talks, which are due to take place in Istanbul. The location was agreed after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke to Vladimir Putin on Sunday.

Over the weekend, Mr Zelensky said he was willing to discuss neutrality and offer security guarantees to Moscow to secure peace “without delay”.

Speaking to independent Russian journalists the Ukrainian President signalled that his country would be prepare to abandon its bid to join Nato, in an apparent concession to the Kremlin’s demands.

Moscow has long demanded that Ukraine drop any hope of joining Nato, claiming such a move would be a threat to Russian security.

Mr Zelensky also mentioned some form of “compromise” involving the eastern Ukrainian territories known as the Donbas, although he did not suggest this might involve ceding land.

This terrority includes parts of Luhansk and Donetsk regions which are currently self-declared “republics” run by Russian-backed separatists.

He also insisted that the issue of neutrality would be put to Ukrainian voters in a referendum after Russian troops withdraw. In overnight comments, he added that “territorial integrity” remained Kyiv’s priority at the talks.

Other issues expected to be discussed at the peace talks include Russia’s demands for Ukrainian disarmament, “de-nazification” of Ukraine’s government, and additional language rights for Russian speakers.

Professor Weller said: “De-nazification and disarmament are not real issues. Additional language rights for Russian speakers in Ukraine, as demanded by President Putin, are no major obstacle either.

“What is left is the demand to recognise Crimea as part of Russia, and to give in to the supposed independence of Luhansk and Donetsk, with the prospect of subsequent annexation by Moscow looming.

“This unmasks what remains of the Russian campaign as one aiming for the acquisition of territory by force.”

Officials began making their way to Istanbul on Monday. Mykhailo Podolyak, head of the Ukrainian delegation, said the start time depended on when all parties to the peace talks could get there.

“While we cannot and will not speak about progress at the talks, the fact that they continue to take place in person is important, of course,” said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov.

It will be the first time in two weeks such talks will take place, after Sergei Lavrov and Dmytro Kuleba, the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers, met for discussions in the Turkish resort town of Antalya on 10 March, overseen by Turkish foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu. That meeting did not yield concrete results, although discussions have been taking place in the background.

So far the negotiations have failed to make progress on ending the war that has killed thousands and driven more than 10 million Ukrainians from their homes – with almost four million fleeing abroad.

Since then, both sides have met via video link, rather than face to face, and have publicly discussed progress on a diplomatic solution. However, neither has budged over Russia’s territorial demands, including Crimea, which Moscow seized and annexed in 2014, and the Donbas region, which Moscow says Kyiv cede to Russian-backed separatists.

“I don’t think there will be any breakthrough on the main issues,” Ukrainian interior ministry adviser Vadym Denysenko said on Monday.

However, Ihor Zhovkva, deputy head of Mr Zelensky’s office, relayed optimism that Turkey could offer Ukraine security guarantees as part of any deal with Russia to end the war. “Turkey is among those countries that could become guarantors of our security in the future,” he said.

Mr Lavrov said on Monday that Mr Putin and Mr Zelensky could meet – something the Ukrainian president has been demanding repeatedly for weeks – but only after the two sides are closer to agreeing on key issues, saying a meeting now would be “counterproductive”.

“The meeting is necessary once we have clarity regarding solutions on all key issues,” Mr Lavrov said in an interview with Serbian media.

On the forthcoming talks in Turkey, he said he would like negotiations “to be fruitful”.",https://inews.co.uk/news/world/russia-ukraine-peace-talks-nato-concessions-kremlin-ceasefire-turkey-summit-1543346

Chief Ukrainian negotiator David Arakhamia further confirmed that the peace talks will be held on March 28-30.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday held a telephonic conversation with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin and agreed for Istanbul to host the talks between Russia and Ukraine.

The two leaders ""agreed that the next meeting of the negotiation teams of Russia and Ukraine will be held in Istanbul"", the statement said.

According to media reports, during the conversation, Erdogan told Putin that a ceasefire and peace between Russia and Ukraine must be achieved as soon as possible and the humanitarian situation in the region should be improved.

Reportedly, Erdogan said that an agreement has been reached on four of the six negotiating points between Russia and Ukraine which include: Ukraine not pursuing North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) membership, use of the Russian language in Ukraine, disarmament and security guarantees.

Furthermore, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in a statement on Monday that no major progress had been made in the talks themselves, or on the idea of a potential meeting between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

""Our priorities in the negotiations are known: sovereignty, territorial integrity of Ukraine are beyond doubt,"" Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address. ""Effective guarantees of security are a must. Obviously, our goal is peace and return to normal life in our country as soon as possible.""

The new talks – starting in Turkey on either Monday or Tuesday, according to conflicting reports – come after the Russian military said it would begin focusing on eastern Ukraine in a move some saw as a scaling back of Moscow's ambitions.

""Today, during another round of video negotiations, it was decided to hold the next in-person round of the two delegations in Turkey on March 28-30,"" Davyd Arakhamia, a Ukraine negotiator and politician wrote on Facebook.

""I don't think there will be any breakthrough on the main issues,"" interior ministry adviser Vadym Denysenko said on Monday.

Russia and Ukraine failed to make a breakthrough on March 10 in Antalya in their first top-level talks since Moscow launched its invasion in late February.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba met for talks in the Turkish resort town of Antalya, which Çavuşoğlu also attended. The talks were largely inconclusive, but Ankara considers the fact that they took place at all a success.

Neither intense diplomacy nor steadily mounting sanctions have persuaded Putin to halt the war.

President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said last week that Russia and Ukraine appeared to have reached an understanding on four out of six negotiating points; Ukraine staying out of NATO, the use of Russian language in Ukraine, disarmament and security guarantees.

Kuleba said Friday however that there was ""no consensus"" on key points with Russia.

Turkey has been one of the countries leading efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has impacted millions of civilians. Turkey says it can facilitate peace talks between Ukraine and Russia, but says that a cease-fire and humanitarian corridors are needed first.

NATO ally Turkey borders Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea and has good ties with both. Since the beginning of the conflict, Ankara has offered to mediate between the two sides and host peace talks, underlining its support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty. Having recently called Russia’s invasion an unacceptable violation of international law, Turkey has carefully formulated its rhetoric not to offend Moscow, with which it has close energy, defense and tourism ties.

While forging close ties with Russia on energy, defense and trade, and relying heavily on Russian tourists, Turkey has sold drones to Ukraine, which angered Moscow. Turkey also opposes Russian policies in Syria and Libya, as well as Moscow’s annexation of Crimea.

Erdoğan has repeatedly said Turkey will not abandon its relations with Russia or Ukraine, underlining that Ankara’s ability to speak to both sides is an asset.

Neutrality demand

A key demand from Putin, even before his troops rolled into Ukraine on Feb. 24, was that it renounce its stated intention of eventually joining NATO.

The Kremlin earlier this month said Sweden and Austria offered models of neutrality that Ukraine could adopt.

NATO's 1949 treaty gives any European nation the right to apply for membership, and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said in January that ""we will not slam the door shut on NATO's open-door policy.""

But NATO members have said Ukraine membership is a distant option at best. Were Kyiv to join the 30-member Western alliance, NATO would be committed to help defend it against any future attack.

The new round of talks come as Russia has de facto control over the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk republics in the country's eastern Donbass region.

Negotiating teams have arrived in Istanbul for the first face-to-face talks in more than a fortnight between Kyiv and Moscow, although expectations remain low of any significant breakthrough.

Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky said his side was prepared to offer guarantees to Russia and was looking for peace “without delay”.

“Security guarantees and neutrality, the non-nuclear status of our state – we’re ready to do that. That’s the most important point... they started the war because of it,” he said in an interview with Russian journalists.

The Ukrainian leader has suggested as much before, but rarely so forcefully, and the latest remarks could provide fresh momentum for Tuesday’s talks.

Ukraine’s priorities would be, he said, “sovereignty and territorial integrity”.

Zelensky said one possible compromise could see Russia pull back its troops to areas where they had been before the invasion started on 24 February.

“I realise that it’s impossible to force Russia to fully leave the territory. It could lead to World War Three. I understand completely. I’m fully aware of it,” he said. “That is why I’m saying, yes, this is a compromise: Go back to where it all started and then we’ll try to resolve the issue of Donbas, the complex issue of Donbas.”

He added: “That’s why I’m saying this is a compromise. Go back to where this all started and then we’ll try to solve the difficult Donbas issue.”

“So we meet, we make a deal, and that’s enough – we sign a deal, stamp it, or sign it in blood. That’s enough to start the troop withdrawal process. The troops must be withdrawn, everyone signs the guarantees, and that’s it,” he said.

President Zelensky also called on Vladimir Putin to be directly involved in the talks and meet him face-to-face.

“We must come to an agreement with the president of the Russian Federation, and in order to reach an agreement, he needs to get out of there on his own feet.. and come to meet me.”

His advisor, Alexander Rodnyansky, told the BBC that Ukraine was, however, unwilling to give up territory.

“If you ask the people who live in these areas, they wouldn’t want to live in Russia,” said Mr Rodnyansky. “How can we leave them? Let alone the whole idea of slicing up our country.”

Russia’s foreign minister said that the talks could only begin after the key elements of a potential deal are negotiated. Sergei Lavrov said that “the meeting is necessary once we have clarity regarding solutions on all key issues”.

Speaking in an interview with Serbian media, Lavrov alleged that Ukraine only want to “imitate talks” while Russia needs specific results that would be secured by the countries’ leaders.

The war is well into its fifth week and has so far caused the deaths of thousands and forced some 10 million people from their homes, many fleeing Ukraine altogether.

On the ground on Monday, the situation continued to deteriorate in the besieged city of Mariupol.

Officials said up to 200,000 people were still trapped in the city which has been obliterated after weeks of shooting and shelling by Russian forces.

Supplies were increasingly scarce, said one resident who had fled. Alina Beskrovna, who made it across the border to Poland, said desperate people were melting snow for water and cooking on open fires “under shelling and bombs just because if you don’t, you will have nothing to eat”.

“There is no medicine. A lot of people are just, I think, starving to death in their apartments right now with no help,” she said. “It’s a mass murder that’s happening at the hands of the Russians.”

Ukraine estimated on Monday that the war had cost the country more than £430bn in terms of destroyed infrastructure.

On the ground, Ukrainian forces claimed to have retaken the town of Irpin, close to Kyiv, though there was no independent confirmation. Kyiv also said it would investigate claims that Russian troops had been tortured after videos on social media apparently being shot.

On the diplomatic front, the foreign secretary Liz Truss said Putin “must fail in Ukraine” and said Russia was using “abhorrent tactics” by abducting Ukrainian politicians, activists and journalists.

Germany’s energy minister Robert Habeck said the G7 had rejected a Russian demand that some countries pay rubles for its natural gas exports. Economists said that demand appeared designed to try to support the Russian currency, which is under pressure from Western sanctions imposed in the wake of the invasion.

In Moscow, Russia’s top independent newspaper suspended its online and print operations after a warning from the country’s authorities.

Novaya Gazeta announced the decision on Monday, saying it would resume its investigative work after the war in Ukraine ends.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erodgan said last week that Russia and Ukraine appeared to have reached an understanding on four out of six negotiating points: Ukraine staying out of North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, the use of the Russian language in Ukraine, disarmament and security guarantees.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said last Friday, however, that there was ""no consensus"" on key points with Russia.",https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/new-ukraine-russia-talks-next-week
