Moscow, Mar 19: Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday accused Kyiv of ""war crimes"" in a call with his French counterpart, saying that Moscow was doing ""everything possible"" to avoid civilian deaths in Ukraine.





""Attention was drawn to the numerous war crimes committed daily by the Ukrainian security forces,"" the Kremlin said of the call between Putin and Emmanuel Macron.

""In particular massive rocket and artillery attacks on the cities of Donbas,"" the Kremlin added, referring to Ukraine's Russian-speaking east, part of which is controlled by pro-Moscow separatists. Putin told Macron the Russian army was ""doing everything possible to safeguard the lives of peaceful civilians, including by organising humanitarian corridors for their safe evacuation"", the Kremlin said. Both leaders also discussed ongoing negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv to end the conflict in Ukraine in the call, which was a ""French initiative"", it said.

Macron has played a leading role in trying to defuse the crisis through a diplomatic push that has seen him speak with Putin in person or by phone around a dozen times since the conflict began. During the latest call, which lasted one hour 10 minutes, Macron expressed his ""extreme concern"" over the fate of Mariupol, the southern coastal city that has been hit by intense bombardments in recent days. Macron's office said he urged ""a lifting of the siege and humanitarian access"" to the city, with ""concrete and verifiable measures"" to ensure residents' safety. The French president also ""again demanded the immediate respect of a cease-fire"" in Ukraine, the Elysee Palace said.",https://www.newsbharati.com/Encyc/2022/3/19/Putin-claims-Ukrainian-Azov-battalion-indulging-in-war-crimes.html

Russia now pursuing 'strategy of attrition,' U.K. defense ministry says The British defense ministry believes the Kremlin has ""been surprised"" by the resistance of Ukrainian forces to its attack and invasion of the country, and is now pursuing a strategy likely to increase harm to civilians. The United Kingdom in an intelligence update Saturday said that Russia ""is now pursuing a strategy of attrition."" ""This is likely to involve the indiscriminate use of firepower resulting in increased civilian casualties, destruction of Ukrainian infrastructure, and intensify the humanitarian crisis,"" the U.K. defense ministry said. Cities in Ukraine have been bombarded since Russia invaded the country in what Western countries have condemned as an unprovoked and unjustified attack. The United Nations has recorded 2,149 civilian casualties in Ukraine since Russia attacked Feb. 24, including 816 killed — 59 of which were children.The U.N. human rights office says the actual number of civilian casualties is ""much higher."" Russia has denied targeting civilians. More than 3 million refugees have fled the country, according to the U.N. Share this -







Celebrated Ukrainian actor Oksana Shvets is killed in Kyiv Celebrated Ukrainian actor Oksana Shvets was killed in Kyiv when a residential building was hit by Russian shelling, her theater company announced Thursday. She was 67. The Molodyi Theater, where Shvets had been a troupe member for decades, said in a Facebook post that there was “unrepairable grief in the family of Molodyi Theater,"" according to an NBC News translation. “There is no forgiveness for the enemy that has come to our land,” the post said. Shvets, who studied at the Ivan Franko Drama Theater and the Institute of Theater Arts, appeared in dozens of roles at the Young Theater, including a recent production of the play “Enchanted.” She was awarded the Merited Artist of Ukraine, an honorary title for outstanding achievement in performing arts. Shvets was killed as Russian forces advanced on Ukraine’s capital and appeared to target civilians. Kyiv's city council said Friday that since the invasion began, Russian attacks have damaged 36 residential buildings, five homes and 11 schools, including four kindergartens, according to an NBC News translation. The officials said that 222 people, including four children, have been killed. NBC News has not been able to independently verify those claims. Russia has denied targeting civilians.

Russian cosmonauts arrive at International Space Station in flight suits in colors of Ukraine flag Three Russian cosmonauts have arrived at the International Space Station wearing flight suits in yellow and blue colors that match the Ukrainian flag. The men were the first new arrivals on the space station since the start of the Russian war in Ukraine last month. Video of one of the cosmonauts taken as the capsule prepared to dock with the space station showed him wearing a blue flight suit. It was unclear what, if any, message the yellow uniforms they changed into were intended to send. Oleg Artemyev was asked about the yellow flight suits when the newly arrived cosmonauts were able to talk to family back on Earth. He said every crew chooses its own flight suits, so that they are not all the same. “It became our turn to pick a color. But in fact, we had accumulated a lot of yellow material so we needed to use it. So that’s why we had to wear yellow,” he said. Artemyev, Denis Matveyev and Sergey Korsakov blasted off successfully from the Russia-leased Baikonur launch facility in Kazakhstan in their Soyuz MS-21 spacecraft at 8:55 p.m. Friday. They smoothly docked at the station just over three hours later, joining two Russians, four Americans and a German on the orbiting outpost. Share this -







Ukraine says it’ll take years to defuse mines KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine’s interior minister said Friday that it will take years to defuse unexploded ordnances after the Russian invasion. Denys Monastyrsky said that the country will need Western assistance to cope with the massive task once the war is over. “A huge number of shells and mines have been fired at Ukraine and a large part haven’t exploded, they remain under the rubble and pose a real threat,” Monastyrsky said. “It will take years, not months, to defuse them.” In addition to the unexploded Russian ordnances, the Ukrainian troops also have planted land mines at bridges, airports and other key infrastructure to prevent Russians from using them. “We won’t be able to remove the mines from all that territory, so I asked our international partners and colleagues from the European Union and the United States to prepare groups of experts to demine the areas of combat and facilities that came under shelling,” Monastyrsky said. He noted that another top challenge is dealing with fires caused by the relentless Russian barrages. He said there’s a desperate shortage of personnel and equipment to deal with the fires amid the constant shelling. Share this -







Macron, Scholz press for cease-fire in calls with Putin PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday asked Russian President Vladimir Putin to lift the siege of Mariupol, allow humanitarian access and order an immediate cease-fire, Macron’s office said. Macron spoke with the Russian leader on the phone for 70 minutes. Earlier in the day, Putin had a conversation with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who also pressed for an immediate cease-fire. Macron, who has spoken numerous times with Putin, revisited complaints over repeated attacks on civilians and Russia’s failure to respect human rights in Ukraine, the presidential Elysee Palace said. It said that Putin, in turn, laid the blame for the war on Ukraine. Macron, who is campaigning to renew his mandate in April elections, said during a town hall-style meeting shortly before the call that he talks to Putin because he believes there is a way toward peace, between the Ukrainian resistance, tough Western sanctions and diplomatic pressure. “We must do everything to find it,” he said.

Over 9,100 Ukrainians evacuated through humanitarian corridors More than 9,100 Ukrainians were evacuated from the war-torn country on Friday through humanitarian corridors, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in a video posted to Telegram. At least 500 people were transported by bus, while others fled by car. Ten evacuation buses will be available Saturday from the port city of Berdyansk, Vereshchuk said. The evacuees, the majority from the northeastern region of Sumy, used seven of nine previously established humanitarian corridors.

Ukrainian engineers repairing power lines at nuclear plant Engineers repairing one of three damaged power lines linking Europe's largest nuclear power plant to Ukraine's electricity grid expect work to be completed by early next week, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. Russian forces took control of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant on March 4, damaging two high-voltage external power lines. A third lost connection last week but is expected to be reconnected Tuesday. All safety systems at the plant remain fully functional, and there are no safety concerns, IAEA said. In Kharkiv, a nuclear research facility previously damaged by shelling continues to have no external power supply. Personnel remain at the facility, which is used for research, development and radioisotope production for medical and industrial applications. Overall, eight of Ukraine's 15 reactors are operational, the agency said, and radiation levels are in the normal range. Share this -

In a video conference, Biden ""described the implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia,"" the White House said. The two leaders also discussed Taiwan.

Xi tells Biden that China committed to international norms, ministry says Biden holds call with Chinese President Xi Jinping March 18, 2022 03:29 In a Friday morning video call, Chinese President Xi Jinping told President Joe Biden that China is committed to international norms regarding Ukraine, the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement. It said the two leaders spoke about the situation in Ukraine, on which China has taken a neutral position. The U.S. has been concerned that China is considering supplying Russia with military equipment to bolster its invasion. ""China stands for peace and opposes war. This is embedded in China’s history and culture. China makes a conclusion independently based on the merits of each matter. China advocates upholding international law and universally recognized norms governing international relations. China adheres to the UN Charter and promotes the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security,"" the ministry said. Xi told Biden the U.S. and NATO should have a dialogue with Russia about what precipitated Russia's invasion into Ukraine, the ministry said, and Xi also expressed concerns about sanctions. ""Sweeping and indiscriminate sanctions would only make the people suffer,"" he said, in part, according to the ministry. If further escalated, they could trigger serious crises in global economy and trade, finance, energy, food, and industrial and supply chains, crippling the already languishing world economy and causing irrevocable losses.""

Ukrainian negotiator tells experts to 'take a break,' says, 'We have everything in order' Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian presidential adviser and negotiator in the peace talks with Russia, told experts on Friday to ""take a break"" from commenting on how to wage war against and negotiate with Russia, suggesting that doing so implies Ukraine's leaders are unclear about what actions to take. ""Please, stop the 'experts' blabbering about how to wage a war or negotiate properly while hiding in an unknown place,"" he tweeted. ""We know what we’re doing & we‘ll correct all their mistakes."" ""We have everything in order,"" Podolyak said in a video posted with the tweet. ""We are absolutely defending our freedom."" ""If we continue what we have been doing for many years, when we split our country, we can get a very insignificant result, and we only need a winning result,"" he added. Podolyak said the war has united Ukraine and shows the country's strength. ""Look, we all know, we understand very well what values are in Ukraine now, what a powerful country Ukraine is, and we will definitely not give up any interest, especially for our children who are sitting in basements under Russian fire and for our heroes who die in the battles,"" he said.

Some big name firms are balking at shunning Russia, despite Ukraine invasion While hundreds of well-known companies like McDonald's and Coca-Cola are shutting down or suspending their operations in Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine, a Kansas-based oil, gas and manufacturing giant is sitting tight for now. Koch Industries, whose subsidiary Guardian Industries operates two glass-manufacturing plants in Russia that employ 600 people, said closing up shop now would put its workers there “at greater risk and do more harm than good.” “The horrific and abhorrent aggression against Ukraine is an affront to humanity,” Koch Industries President Dave Robertson said in a statement, adding that the company is “complying with all applicable sanctions, laws and regulations governing our relationships and transactions within all countries where we operate.” But Koch Industries, which has contributed millions of dollars to the Republican Party and has a couple of other operations in Moscow that employs a dozen more people, is hardly the only well-known firm bucking the tide of iconic companies exiting Russia, according to a list compiled by Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a senior professor at the Yale University School of Management. As of Friday, there were 26 other companies that Sonnenfeld has categorized as “digging in” and defying international calls to get out of Russia. Read the full story. Share this -







Russian cosmonauts set to launch to space station against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine Three Russian cosmonauts are set to launch to the International Space Station on Friday, a normally routine mission to the orbiting outpost that is now taking place against the backdrop of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Scrutiny over the planned liftoff has grown as the conflict in Ukraine has strained relations between Russia and its space station partners, including NASA, and has called into question the future of the iconic orbiting lab. Cosmonauts Oleg Artemyev, Denis Matveev and Sergey Korsakov are scheduled to launch aboard a Soyuz rocket and capsule at 11:55 a.m. ET from Russia's spaceport, the Baikonur Cosmodrome, in southern Kazakhstan.

U.S. ambassador: Moscow's bioweapons allegations 'malarky,' like a 'chain email from some dark corner of the internet' The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, denounced Russia on Friday for what she called false allegations that Ukraine performs biological weapons research and has U.S. support for the effort. At a U.N. Security Council meeting, she said the Russian representative to the United Nations went on a ""tirade of bizarre conspiracy theories"" last week and this week ""we're hearing a whole lot more where that came from — things that sound like they were forwarded to him on a chain email from some dark corner of the internet."" ""President Biden has a word for this kind of talk: malarkey,"" she said. Thomas-Greenfield reiterated that despite Russia's claims, Ukraine does not have a biological weapons program. ""There are no Ukrainian biological weapons laboratories — not near Russia's border, not anywhere. There are only public health facilities, proudly — and I say proudly — supported and recognized by the U.S. government, the World Health Organization, and other governments and international institutions,"" she said. ""In fact, it is Russia that has long maintained a biological weapons program in violation of international law. It is Russia that has a well-documented history of using chemical weapons. It is Russia who is the aggressor here."" The ambassador said the U.S. has deep concerns that Russia's decision to call Friday's meeting over the allegations ""is a potential false flag effort in action."" ""Russia has repeatedly — repeatedly — accused other countries of the very violations it plans to perpetrate. We continue to believe it is possible that Russia may be planning to use chemical or biological agents against the Ukrainian people,"" she said. Share this -

At least 816 civilians killed in Ukraine since invasion, U.N. Rights Office says At least 816 civilians have died since Russia invaded Ukraine last month, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a statement Friday. Seven girls and 16 boys were among the dead, the statement said, although it added that it believed the actual figures were ""considerably higher,"" because many reports were still pending corroboration and others had been delayed. A further 1,333 civilians had been injured in the conflict, it said. NBC News has not independently confirms these numbers.

Burger King partner in Russia refuses to close 800 locations Burger King is moving to divest its 15 percent stake in its Russian business, but the burger chain said it can’t legally suspend operations in the market right away. The Restaurant Brands International chain announced last week it was suspending all corporate support for its 800-plus franchised locations in Russia in response to the Kremlin’s ongoing attacks on Ukraine. The suspension includes refusing approvals for further investment or expansion and pausing operations, marketing and its supply chain. But the company’s International President David Shear laid out in an open letter to employees on Thursday that the structure of the company’s Russian business hampers its ability to shutter restaurants in the market like some of its competitors. “Would we like to suspend all Burger King operations immediately in Russia? Yes. Are we able to enforce a suspension of operations today? No,” Shear said. Burger King entered Russia through a joint venture with businessperson Alexander Kolobov, Investment Capital Ukraine and VTB Capital, which has been hit by U.S. sanctions as an affiliate of a major Russian bank.

Facing resistance in Ukraine, Putin turns to a familiar playbook: Bombing civilians It was a desperate plea from a city under siege: ""CHILDREN"" in huge bold letters. Satellite images from Maxar Technologies, a U.S. Defense contractor, this week showed the word clearly written in front of and behind a theater that Ukraine says was sheltering women and children in the port city of Mariupol. But on Wednesday, the building was blown up with hundreds of civilians inside, according to the Mariupol City Council. ""Russians could not have not known this was a civilian shelter,"" Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said. The number of casualties is not yet known — and the Kremlin denies targeting civilians — but experts say the incident is an indication that Russian President Vladimir Putin has turned to a familiar and pitiless playbook. With his troops bogged down in the mud, running out of food and fuel and hemorrhaging casualties, many analysts believe that Putin's battle plan is in the mire — and in desperation he has pivoted to the brutal tactics used in the Russian republic of Chechnya in 1999 and in Syria in 2015.

Ukrainians take a page from Tolkien in nickname for Russian troops Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko on Friday referred to Russian forces as ""orcs."" Ukrainian resistance fighters and protesters are using the term, too. The nickname appears to be a reference to the brutish monsters of the same name from J.R.R. Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" fantasy series. In the books (and their film adaptations), the Dark Lord Sauron dispatches the orcs to do his bidding on the battlefield. In the decades since Tolkien's novels were published, orcs have taken root in the popular consciousness — but the author's conception of the malevolent goblins has also drawn accusations of racism.

Democrats link Ukraine’s democracy struggle to one closer to home WASHINGTON — Top Democrats are drawing parallels between the existential fight for democracy in Ukraine and the struggle to protect American democracy, citing the war to reaffirm their desire for new guardrails around institutions like free and fair elections. “I’m hoping that seeing the Ukrainians come under attack because they’re a democracy and defend their country so bravely because they believe in democracy increases faith in ours here at home,” Rep. Colin Allred, D-Texas, said in an interview. “I feel very strongly that we’ve had, really, an unprecedented period of questioning our own small-d democratic values and, culminating in January 6, an attempt to overthrow a presidential election here. “The best thing we can do for the world is to present an example of a functioning democracy at a time when, around the world, autocracies are on the rise and are literally attacking democracies like in Ukraine,” Allred said, suggesting that the death and destruction inflicted by Russian leader Vladimir Putin will give pause to Americans who may want to ""put our faith in a strongman.""

Biden and Xi to hold call as U.S. steps up pressure on China U.S. President Joe Biden will hold a phone call with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, on Friday as Washington raises concerns over China’s growing ties with Russia. The direct talks, which are the first between the two leaders since November, will be held at 9 a.m. ET. On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Biden “will make clear that China will bear responsibility for any actions it takes to support Russia’s aggression, and we will not hesitate to impose costs.” Beijing has so far avoided direct condemnation of the Russian invasion and has criticized the wide-ranging sanctions imposed on Moscow by the West. Some U.S. lawmakers have raised the idea of sanctioning China as well if it is found to be supporting Russia’s war effort. “China opposes all forms of unilateral sanctions and ‘long-arm jurisdiction’ by the U.S.,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a news briefing on Wednesday. “We will resolutely defend the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies and individuals.” “If the U.S. insists on having its own way, China will definitely take strong countermeasures,” he added.

India reportedly bought 3 million barrels of oil from Russia India has reportedly bought 3 million barrels of crude oil from Russia, according to The Associated Press. Eighty-five percent of oil in India is imported, and the country is under strain to meet demand domestically. Russia reportedly offered India a discounted price of 20 percent below global benchmark prices, according to the AP. “India imports most of its oil requirements.

“Attention was drawn to the numerous war crimes committed daily by the Ukrainian security forces,” the Kremlin said of the call between Putin and Emmanuel Macron.

“In particular massive rocket and artillery attacks on the cities of Donbas,” the Kremlin added, referring to Ukraine’s Russian-speaking east, part of which is controlled by pro-Moscow separatists.

Putin told Macron the Russian army was “doing everything possible to safeguard the lives of peaceful civilians, including by organising humanitarian corridors for their safe evacuation”, the Kremlin said.

Both leaders also discussed ongoing negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv to end the conflict in Ukraine in the call, which was a “French initiative”, it said.

Macron has played a leading role in trying to defuse the crisis through a diplomatic push that has seen him speak with Putin in person or by phone around a dozen times since the conflict began.

During the latest call, which lasted one hour 10 minutes, Macron expressed his “extreme concern” over the fate of Mariupol, the southern coastal city that has been hit by intense bombardments in recent days.

Macron’s office said he urged “a lifting of the siege and humanitarian access” to the city, with “concrete and verifiable measures” to ensure residents’ safety.

Here’s what we’ve seen so far:

Turkey has been testing its ties with Moscow by sending armed drones to Kyiv and invoking a 1936 treaty to limit Russian warships’ access to the Black Sea. But Ankara is also competing for the role of mediator, having hosted the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers in Antalya last week.

The US has barred imports of Russian oil and natural gas after failing to convince Saudi Arabia to increase oil production to offset global price increases that benefit Moscow.

Egypt and the United Arab Emirates have tread cautiously to avoid harming their ties with Moscow, while Israel has led with humanitarian aid and offered to mediate the conflict directly.

The attack began Feb. 24, when Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a ""special military operation.""

Russian forces moving from neighboring Belarus toward Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, have advanced closer to the city center in recent days despite the resistance. Heavy shelling and missile attacks, many on civilian buildings, continue in Kyiv, as well as major cities like Kharkiv and Mariupol. Russia also bombed western cities for the first time this week, targeting Lviv and a military base near the Poland border.

Russia has been met by sanctions from the United States, Canada and countries throughout Europe, targeting the Russian economy as well as Putin himself.

Ukraine accuses Russia of forcibly deporting some civilians to Russia

Local authorities in the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol have accused Russian forces of forcibly deporting residents to Russia.

Mariupol’s city council said in a statement it received information Sunday morning that Russian troops were forcing residents of Azovstalkaya Street and from part of the Levoberezhny area to go to Russia. The statement said Russian forces were confiscating the Ukrainian passports of those being deported and issuing them a piece of paper.

ABC News has not independently confirmed the reports of people being forced to leave by Russian troops.

The Russian state news agency TASS reported on Saturday that 13 buses carrying 350 people were moving to Russia. About 50 of those people were to be sent by railway to the Yaroslavl region and the rest to temporary processing centers in Taganrog, a city in Russia’s southeastern Rostov region near Ukraine.

Ukraine has been trying to evacuate thousands of residents from Mariupol, with tens of thousands managing to escape in the past few days -- mostly in private cars heading towards the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhzhia. Around 300,000 people are trapped in Mariupol, according to Ukrainian officials.

In some parts of Ukraine, Russia has opened ""humanitarian corridors"" to Russia. Some people in some cities have chosen to go to Russia to escape the fighting, though the vast majority are seeking to move to safety in other parts of Ukraine.

The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Ukraine has recorded 2,361 civilian casualties in the country, including 902 dead and 1,459 injured.

In Ukraine's Zhytomyr region, more than 100 Ukrainian troops and foreign mercenaries were killed by a missile strike, the Russian Ministry of Defense claimed on Sunday.

""A strike using high-precision air-to-surface missiles has been carried out on a special operations forces training center of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, where foreign mercenaries in Ukraine were based near the populated locality of Ovruch in the Zhytomyr region,"" Russian Defense Ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov said in a press conference.

Russian journalist who protested on live television: 'It’s Putin's war'

Marina Ovsyannikova, the Russian state TV editor who protested the invasion of Ukraine on live television, continued her campaign against the war in an interview with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos on Sunday.

""The Russian people are really against the war,"" Ovsyannikova said. ""It’s Putin’s war and not the Russian people’s war.""

Ovsyannikova ran onto the set of the main Russian state news live broadcast earlier this month with an anti-war sign to protest Russia's invasion of Ukraine, standing behind a Channel One anchor as they were speaking.

The sign read, ""NO WAR"" and ""Don't believe the propaganda. They're lying to you here,"" in English and Russian, respectively.

Ovsyannikova said it was a ""spontaneous decision"" for her to go onto the set, but ""the dissatisfaction with the current situation has been accumulating for years, because the propaganda on our state channels has become more and more distorted.""

""What we showed on our programs was very different than the reality,"" she said.

Ovsyannikova hoped her demonstration would attract attention to the propaganda and ""inspire more people to speak up.""

Ovsyannikova was fined 30,000 rubles (about $280) after being charged with an ""administrative offense"" stemming from an earlier video she recorded calling on Russians to take part in demonstrations against the war.

Zelenskyy accuses Russia of 'war crimes,' blocking aid to besieged Mariupol

Russia’s attacks on Mariupol will ""go down in history"" as a series of ""war crimes,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video address early on Sunday.

""The terror the occupiers did to the peaceful city will be remembered for centuries to come,"" Zelenskyy said, according to an official translation.

More than 9,000 people were evacuated from the besieged city on Friday, followed by an additional 4,000 people on Saturday, according to Ukrainian officials.

But Russian forces blocked aid to those still trapped in the city, Zelenksyy said.

""This is a totally deliberate tactic,"" Zelenskyy said in an earlier video address, posted just after midnight on Saturday morning. ""They have a clear order to do absolutely everything to make the humanitarian catastrophe in Ukrainian cities an 'argument' for Ukrainians to cooperate with the occupiers.""

Blocking aid amounts to a ""war crime,"" Zelenskyy said, adding that every Russian soldier should be held ""100%"" accountable with a ""compulsory one-way ticket to The Hague,"" where the International Criminal Court is located.

Russia increases 'indiscriminate shelling' on eastern cities, UK military says

Russian forces attempted to push into cities in eastern Ukraine have made ""limited progress"" in the last week, so they’ve turned instead to “indiscriminate shelling,” the UK Ministry of Defense said on Sunday.

The shelling of urban areas has caused ""widespread destruction and large numbers of civilian casualties,"" the Ministry said in an update.

""It is likely Russia will continue to use its heavy firepower to support assaults on urban areas as it looks to limit its own already considerable losses, at the cost of further civilian casualties,"" the update said.

UNICEF calls for strengthened measures to protect children fleeing Ukraine from human trafficking, exploitation

The United Nations Children's fund warned Saturday that children fleeing the war in Ukraine are at an increased risk of human trafficking and exploitation.

""Traffickers often seek to exploit the chaos of large scale population movements, and with more than 1.5 million children having fled Ukraine as refugees since [Feb.24], and countless others displaced by violence inside the country, the threat facing children is real and growing,"" UNICEF said.

According to an analysis conducted by UNICEF and the Inter-Agency Coordination Group against Trafficking, 28% of identified victims of trafficking globally are children.

""In the context of Ukraine, UNICEF child protection experts believe that children would likely account for an even higher proportion of potential trafficking victims given that children and women represent nearly all of the refugees who have fled the country so far,"" UNICEF said.

According to UNICEF, more than 500 unaccompanied children were identified crossing the Ukrainian border into Romania between Feb. 24 and March 17. It also estimates that the true number of separated children who have fled Ukraine is likely much higher.

""Displaced children are extremely vulnerable to being separated from their families, exploited, and trafficked. They need governments in the region to step up and put measures in place to keep them safe,"" said Afshan Khan, UNICEF’s regional director for Europe and Central Asia.

Khan said children need to be screened for their vulnerability as they cross the border into another country.

""UNICEF is calling on governments to improve cross-border collaboration and knowledge exchange between and among border control, law enforcement and child protection authorities and to quickly identify separated children, implement family tracing and reunification procedures for children deprived of parental care,"" UNICEF said.

UNICEF also said additional screening for protection risks should be implemented in shelters, large urban train stations and other locations where refugees gather or pass through.

Lavrov calls West 'unreliable' as an economic partner

The West has proven to be unreliable as an economic partner and a place for keeping foreign exchange reserves, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Saturday.

""Even disregarding the situation with Ukraine and the sanctions, conduct of the West proves that it is unreliable both as a part of the world where major reserve currencies are generated, as an economic partner, and as a country where forex reserves could be kept. They might easily be stolen,"" Lavrov told finalists of the international stage of the Leaders of Russia competition.

This is why Russia is strengthening cooperation with other countries, including China, he said.

Lavrov also commented on the reinstatement of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which would allow Iranian oil supply on the global market.

""We never betray our friends in politics. Venezuela is our friend, and Iran is a state that is very close to us. Secondly, we do not pursue selfish interests, unlike the Americans,"" Lavrov said in response to a question whether the JCPOA reinstatement was advantageous to Russia.

""You can see what they [the Americans] are actually doing, trying to spite Russia and teach it a lesson,"" he said.

""So, the Americans have been contacting Saudi Arabia, the Emirates and Qatar regarding oil and gas. All of those countries, just like Venezuela and Iran, clearly said: when we discuss issues pertaining to the appearance of new actors in the oil market, all of us are committed to the OPEC+ format, where quotas for every actor are discussed and agreed upon by consensus,"" he said.

""For now, I see no reason to believe that this mechanism may somehow be dismantled. No one is interested in that,"" Lavrov said.

Zelenskyy responds to massive Moscow rally

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reacted to the massive concert that occurred Friday in Moscow in support of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and on the eight-year anniversary of Russia’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.

""A big rally took place. And I want to pay attention to one detail. It is reported that a total of about 200,000 people were involved in the rally in the Russian capital -- 100,000 on the streets, about 95,000 at the stadium. Approximately the same number of Russian troops were involved in the invasion of Ukraine,"" Zelenskyy said in his latest national address Friday night.

""Just imagine 14,000 corpses and tens of thousands of wounded and maimed people at that stadium in Moscow,"" he continued. ""There are already so many Russian losses as a result of this invasion. This is the price of war. In a little more than three weeks. The war must end.""

Zelenskyy noted progress in evacuating more than 180,000 Ukrainians through humanitarian corridors, though charged that Russian invaders are blocking the supply of humanitarian aid to some besieged cities.

""This is a totally deliberate tactic. They have a clear order to do absolutely everything to make the humanitarian catastrophe in Ukrainian cities an 'argument' for Ukrainians to cooperate with the occupiers,"" he said. ""This is a war crime. They will be held accountable for this. 100%.""

Biden, Xi hold 1st call in months

President Joe Biden held a video call with Chinese President Xi Jinping for one hour and 50 minutes on Friday, marking the first time the two leaders spoke since November.

The White House readout of the call doesn't say whether the conversation was constructive or not, but the White House said Biden made clear the ""implications and consequences"" if China aligns with Russia and provides them ""material support.""

China's readout of the call said China supports negotiations but passes the buck to the U.S. and NATO to ""conduct dialogue with Russia to solve the crux of the Ukraine crisis and resolve the security concerns of both Russia and Ukraine.""

The call was “direct,” “substantive” and “detailed,” according to a senior administration official.

The official said Biden “really wasn't making specific requests of China” on the call and instead was “laying out his assessment of the situation, what he thinks makes sense, and the implications of certain actions.”

The official said that the call was “less about coming away with a particular view out of conversation today and more about making sure, again, that they were able to really have that direct candidate and detailed and very substantive conversation at the leader level.”

US ambassador calls Russia's biolab allegations 'potential false flag effort in action'

During the meeting Russia convened to air its allegations of dangerous biolabs in Ukraine, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield told her fellow Security Council members that they may be witnessing one of Moscow’s battle tactics unfolding before their eyes.

“I will reiterate the United States’ deep and serious concern that Russia's calling for this meeting is -- is --a potential false flag effort in action. Russia has repeatedly -- repeatedly--accused other countries of the very violations it plans to perpetrate,” she stated. “We continue to believe it is possible that Russia may be planning to use chemical or biological agents against the Ukrainian people.”

“Last week we heard from the Russian representative a tirade of bizarre conspiracy theories. This week, we're hearing a whole lot more where that came from -- things that sound like they were forwarded to him on a chain email from some dark corner of the internet,"" she said.

""President Joe Biden has a word for this kind of talk: malarkey,” Thomas-Greenfield continued, again flatly denying claims that Ukraine has a biological weapons program.

Thomas-Greenfield reminded the room that it is Russia that maintains such a program in violation of international law and has a documented history of using nerve agents against enemies of the Kremlin as well as supporting the use of chemical warfare in Syria.

“We aren't going to dignify Russia's disinformation or conspiracy theories. But we will continue to sound the alarm and tell the world where we think Russia is heading,” she added. “And we will remind the world that Russia has repeatedly -- repeatedly -- lied to this council over recent weeks.""

Russian negotiator says Russia, Ukraine have made progress on issue of neutral status, sticking point is 'security guarantees'

Russian presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, Russia’s lead negotiator in talks with Ukraine, said the two sides have made the most progress on the question of Ukraine’s “neutral status” during the negotiations, but that “nuances” remain around issues of security guarantees for Ukraine if it gives up joining NATO.

The “nuances are connected with what kind of security guarantees Ukraine gets in addition to ones it already has, in the case of renouncing joining the NATO bloc,” Medinsky told Russian media.

Medinsky said the two sides were “somewhere halfway” to meeting each other over the issue of Ukraine’s “demilitarization.""

“As for demilitarisation, I would say it’s 50-50. The issues is I am now authorised to divulge any details of the negotiations and I will not do that, nor concrete figures, nor arguments of the sides, but in this part we are somewhere halfway,” he said.

White House 'focused' on ways to help growing Ukrainian refugee crisis

The Biden administration is ""focused"" on ways to help Ukrainian refugees, as the number of people displaced by the war continues to grow, according to U.S. officials.

More than 3 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia's invasion began, according to the United Nations' refugee agency, in Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II.

""As the numbers increase, as the burden increases for European partners, we will certainly do everything we can to help,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters Thursday, adding it was ""something we're very focused on right now.""

Without offering specifics, Blinken confirmed the administration is ""looking at things that we can do ourselves and do directly -- for example, looking at steps we may be able to take on family reunification and other things.""

One limited option is fast-tracking the process to admit refugees to the U.S. itself, which is defined by law and requires a referral from the U.N.'s refugee agency and thorough vetting. A senior administration official told ABC News that the refugee program ""is not an emergency response program, so our goal would be to provide humanitarian assistance to keep people safe where they are for now.""

As Blinken told reporters, the referral process to be granted refugee status ""takes time."" Refugee resettlement is a yearslong process, and there are already 7,000 Ukrainian refugees in the pipeline, according to resettlement agency Church World Service.

The senior administration official also said U.S. embassies and consulates in the region are processing emergency visa applications, but that they are overwhelmed. ""We are not able to process the volume of the people who are thinking about that as an option,"" the official said.

Refugee resettlement agencies say the administration is considering using the Lautenberg program, which allows religious minorities -- including Ukrainian Greek Catholics and Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Christians -- to bring family members to the U.S. with a potentially expedited refugee status. One agency told ABC News there are thousands of Ukrainian applicants who the U.S. could swiftly admit.

The administration has already approved temporary protected status for any Ukrainians in the U.S. before March 1 -- allowing them to stay and work in the U.S. for at least the next 18 months.
