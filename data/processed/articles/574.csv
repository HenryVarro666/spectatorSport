According to the information spread on social media russian troops allegedly “without resistance” and “without a fight” entered the Ukrainian city of Melitopol in the Zaporizhia region. Some posts refer to russia’s ministry of defense.

This is russian misinformation. On the morning of Feb. 25, russian troops entered the city, then their attack was repelled by the Ukrainian servicemen. Melitopol was surrounded, fighting around the city lasted several days.

Feb. 25

On the morning of Feb. 25, russian troops fired on the SBU building, and a military convoy arrived from the north of the city. The first illogical thing in the fake: if russian troops expected to enter the city without resistance, why did they start with shelling office buildings?

The information that on Feb. 25 the battle was taking place in Melitopol, was reported by the General Staff and the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The chairman of the Melitopol district council Igor Sudakov on Facebook urged citizens not to publish information about the movement of the Armed Forces or Territorial Defense in Melitopol. Another confirmation was that the Ukrainian servicemen were in the city at the time and resisted.

The outskirts of Melitopol were occupied by russian soldiers who came from Crimea. But the other part was held by the Ukrainian servicemen that held the line to prevent the russian advance on Mariupol. Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to the President’s Office, spoke about this at a briefing on Feb. 25.

During the day in Melitopol, urban combats for strategic objects continued. As of 10 p.m., Melitopol was surrounded, there were battles near the city, said the head of the Zaporizhia Military Administration Oleksandr Starukh.

Feb. 26

Battle for the city between the russian occupiers and Ukrainian servicemen continued. “The most difficult situation is in Melitopol. Heavy machinery in the city. The combat continues. The column of heavy machinery passed towards Primorsk. From 8 p.m last day until 8 a.m, we have 14 wounded of our servicemen,” Oleksandr Starukh said on the morning of Feb. 26. Mykhailo Podoliak, an adviser to the head of the Office of the President, confirmed that heavy fighting was continuing in Melitopol.

Propaganda resources began writing at midnight on Feb. 25 that “russian units, without meeting resistance, entered Melitopol.” Then, in fact, the combatting for the city continued.

At noon on March 26, Melitopol Mayor Ivan Fedorov said local officials had lost control of the buildings.

March 1

On March 1, head of the Zaporizhia Military Administration Oleksandr Starukh said Ukrainian governance was in Melitopol, but “the situation is difficult.” “Some institutions are not under the control of the Ukrainian authorities. They have also located units of the national guard of the russian federation that perform tasks of seizing power and making management decisions within Melitopol,” the statement reads.

March 2-4

Civilians also opposed the russian occupiers. On March 2 and 3, citizens with Ukrainian flags and slogans “Orcs, go away” went to peaceful rallies. The occupiers opened fire and wounded civilians. This did not stop the citizens, and on March 4 they again went to rallies with the slogans “Melitopol is Ukraine!”, “Melitopol – get up!”.

2,010666cd-3079-4770-8801-7ecafaa29d81,[],,"Amid heavy shelling in several parts of Ukraine, Melitopol Mayor Ivan Fedorov announced that the Russian troops have taken control of Television and radio towers on Monday. According to a report by the National News Agency of Ukraine or Ukrinform, the announcement from Fedorov came on Facebook where he confirmed about Putin's forces taking control of the city's most popular TV tower and radio towers. ""The city TV tower, same as radio towers, are controlled by the occupiers, those who are controlling the perimeter of the city today, armed Russian troops,"" Ukrinform translates as Fedorov was saying during a Facebook live on Monday.

According to him more than 90 residential buildings were destroyed as a result of the fighting. — NEXTA (@nexta_tv) March 7, 2022

Further, he clarified that neither the city authority nor any other government agencies will be responsible for any announcement or any content broadcasted on both TV and Radio. ""Neither city authorities nor other government authorities can monitor the content,"" he added. Meanwhile, the Belarusian media outlet, Nexta claimed that the Russian forces have destroyed at least 90 residential buildings. It also claimed that the city's cell phone transmitters are now controlled by Moscow. This comes nearly two days after Russia's forces had captured Mariupol, the tenth-largest city in Ukraine and the second-largest in Donetsk Oblast with a population of 4,31,859. Since then, the city has been cut off from all basic necessities. According to Mariupol city mayor, Vadym Boychenko, the residents are now left out without food and water.

In a televised address, he narrated the horrific situation of the city wherein he said that the area of more than 400,000 residents has now been left out without electricity, water, food, medicine and other basic necessities. He appealed to the European Union, the West and international communities for military assistance in order to create a humanitarian corridor for the safe evacuation of more than 4 lakh residents. Boychenko said that the Russian shellings are now targetting hospitals and added that he did not see any signs of stabilisation in the near future. ""The city lost heating, water, and electricity after five days of non-stop missile attacks by Russian troops. People are running out of food and medicine. About 300 wounded are in hospitals, which are also under attack. We don’t see any signs of stabilisation in the city,"" Kyiv Independent quoted Mayor Boychenko as saying.

A little progress had been made on the matter of safe corridors, says Zelenskyy's advisor

Amid this grim situation, Moscow allowed limited cease-fire and the establishment of safe corridors in order to let civilians flee some besieged Ukrainian cities. However, the news agency Associated Press citing Ukrainian officials reported that the evacuation routes were mostly led to Russia and its ally Belarus, drawing withering criticism from Ukraine and others. Notably, the two sides held the third round of talks on Monday, with an advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reporting that a little progress had been made on the matter of safe corridors. Mykhailo Podolyay said without elaboration that “there were some small positive shifts regarding logistics of humanitarian corridors.”

3,010666cd-3079-4770-8801-7ecafaa29d81,['Yuras Karmanau'],2022-03-11 00:00:00,"LVIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia’s airplanes and artillery widened their assault on Ukraine on Friday, striking airfields in the west and a major industrial hub in the east, as Moscow’s forces tried to regroup from recent losses and their onslaught fast reduced crowded cities to rubble.

American defense officials offered an assessment of the Russian air campaign, estimating that invading pilots are averaging 200 sorties a day, compared with five to 10 for Ukrainian forces, which are focusing more on surface-to-air missiles, rocket-propelled grenades and drones to take out Russian aircraft.

New commercial satellite images appeared to capture artillery firing on residential areas between Russian forces and the capital. The images from Maxar Technologies showed muzzle flashes and smoke from the big guns, as well as impact craters and burning homes in the town of Moschun, outside Kyiv, the company said.

In a devastated village east of the capital, villagers climbed over toppled walls and flapping metal strips in the remnants of a pool hall, restaurant and theater freshly blown apart by Russian bombs.

Russian President Vladimir Putin “created this mess, thinking he will be in charge here,” 62-year-old Ivan Merzyk said. In temperatures sinking below freezing, villagers quickly spread plastic wrap or nailed plywood over blown out windows of their homes.

“We are not going away from here,” Merzyk said.

On the economic and political front, the U.S. and its allies moved to further isolate and sanction the Kremlin. President Joe Biden announced that the U.S. will dramatically downgrade its trade status with Russia and also ban imports of Russian seafood, alcohol and diamonds.

The move to revoke Russia’s “most favored nation” status was taken in coordination with the European Union and Group of Seven countries.

“The free world is coming together to confront Putin,” Biden said.

On the ground, Russia’s forces appeared to be trying to regroup and regain momentum after encountering heavier losses and stiffer resistance than anticipated over the past two weeks. Britain’s Ministry of Defense said Russia is trying to “re-set and re-posture” its troops, gearing up for operations against Kyiv.

GRAPHIC WARNING: Video included in this story may contain disturbing images.

“It’s ugly already, but it’s going to get worse,” said Nick Reynolds, a warfare analyst at Royal United Services Institute, a British think tank.

With the invasion in its 16th day, Putin said there had been “certain positive developments” in Russia-Ukraine talks, but gave no details.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed Ukrainian forces had “reached a strategic turning point,” though he did not elaborate.

“It’s impossible to say how many days we will still need to free our land, but it is possible to say that we will do it,” he said via video from Kyiv.

Zelenskyy said authorities were working on establishing 12 humanitarian corridors and trying to ensure food, medicine and other basics get to people across the country. Thousands of soldiers on both sides are believed to have been killed in the invasion, along with Ukrainian civilians.

He accused Russia of kidnapping the mayor of one city, Melitopol, calling the abduction “a new stage of terror.” The Biden administration, citing American intelligence but no evidence, warned before the invasion of Russian plans to detain and kill targeted people in Ukraine. Zelenskyy himself would be a likely top target.

So far, the Russians have made the biggest advances on cities in the east and south while struggling in the north and around Kyiv.

Russia said it used high-precision long-range weapons to put military airfields in Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk in the west “out of action.” The attack on Lutsk killed four Ukrainian servicemen, the mayor said.

Russian airstrikes also targeted for the first time Dnipro, a major industrial hub in the east and Ukraine’s fourth-largest city, with about 1 million people. One person was killed, Ukrainian officials said.

In images of the aftermath released by Ukraine’s emergency agency, firefighters doused a flaming building, and ash fell on bloodied rubble. Smoke billowed over shattered concrete where buildings once stood.

The bombardment continued in Mariupol, where a deadly strike on a maternity hospital this week sparked international outrage and war-crime allegations.

Unrelenting attacks have thwarted repeated attempts to send in food and medicine and evacuate civilians from Mariupol, a city of 430,000. In a statement, the Mariupol mayor’s office said Friday that the toll of people killed during the now 12-day siege had risen to 1,582.

In the face of the unrelenting bombing, “the dead aren’t even being buried,” the mayor’s office said.

Elsewhere, temperatures were forecast to hit -13 degrees Celsius (8 Fahrenheit) in the eastern city of Kharkiv, which has come under heavy bombardment.

About 400 apartment buildings in Kharkiv lost heat, and Mayor Ihor Terekhov appealed to remaining residents to descend into the subway or other underground shelters where blankets and hot food were being distributed.

The latest assaults came a day after satellite photos appeared to show that the huge armored column that was stalled for over a week outside Kyiv had spread out near the capital.

Military analysts were divided over whether the maneuvering by the Russian convoy signaled the imminent start of a siege of Kyiv or was just an effort to disperse some vehicles to more protected positions. The photos showed howitzers newly set up in firing position, and armored units staged near the Antonov Airport north of the city, according to Maxar.

Americans point instead to other forces that are moving toward Kyiv from the northeast and are now about 20 to 30 kilometers (about 10 to 20 miles) east of the city center.

Hundreds of miles to the south of Kyiv, at Mykolaiv, shelling damaged a cancer hospital, according to the head doctor, Maksim Beznosenko. No one was killed.

The United Nations says it has verified 26 attacks on medical centers, medical workers or ambulances since the invasion began, with 12 people killed.

The U.N. political chief said Friday that the international organization had received credible reports that Russian forces were using cluster bombs in populated areas. The bombs scatter smaller explosives over a wide area and are prohibited in cities and towns under international law.

Russians and Ukrainians have held multiple rounds of talks near the Belarus border, and the two countries’ foreign ministers met again Thursday with no apparent progress. Various third countries have also made attempts to broker a stop to the fighting.

Some 2.5 million people have fled Ukraine since the invasion began, according to the United Nations.

5,010666cd-3079-4770-8801-7ecafaa29d81,"['Abc News', 'Luis Martinez', 'March']",,"The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist.

Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Friday on Day 30:

In apparent shift, Russian offensive toward Kyiv stopped, troops now in defensive positions

The official described how Russian forces around Kyiv appear to have stopped offensive operations toward the capital city and are moving into defensive positions as they seem to be prioritizing offensive operations in the Donbas, the eastern part of the country.

""It appears that the Russians are at the moment not pursuing a ground offense or ground offensive towards Kiev,"" said the official. They are digging in. They are establishing defensive positions."" However, the official said that the bombardment of the city using long-range weapons is continuing.

""They don't show any signs of being willing to move on Kyiv from the ground,"" said the official. ""And that is in keeping with our assessment of a couple of days ago that they are going to prioritize the eastern part of the country with in terms of ground offense. And that is exactly what we're seeing.""

Earlier on Friday, a top Russian general told reporters that Russia's initial military operations had been completed and that operations would now focus ""on the most important thing, the complete liberation of Donbas.""

""They have stopped trying to move forward and what they have started to do is try to defend what they have,"" said the senior U.S. defense official. ""We're seeing the Ukrainians really go now on the offense on them around Kyiv and that includes to the west of it."" The official described heavy fighting in the towns of Bucha and Irpin northwest of Kyiv where he said the Ukrainians are 'trying hard to dislodge the Russians.'""

Russian military now prioritizing operations in Donbas in eastern Ukraine

""They are putting their priorities and their effort in the east of Ukraine and that's where still there remains a lot of heavy fighting,"" said the official. ""We think they are trying to not only secure some sort of more, more substantial gains there as a potential negotiating tactic at the table, but also to cut off Ukrainian forces in the eastern part of the country.""

""They are more focused on the Donbas,"" said the official, describing the easternmost area of the country where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting against Ukraine's military for the past eight years.

""The defensive crouch that they're now taking in Kyiv, we think is consistent with their desire now to be more on the offense and to be more aggressive in the east and Donbas."" And that includes increased air bombardment in the region including in the port city of Mariupol that continues to see what the official described as ""vicious vicious fighting.""

Russian forces lose full control of strategic southern city of Kherson

In a significant setback, Russian forces have lost full control of the strategic southern city of Kherson according to the official. If the Ukrainians were to retake the city, it would mark the first time that Russian troops will have been pushed out of a major city seized by Russia.

""It doesn't appear to be as solidly in Russian control as it was before,"" said the official. ""The Ukrainians are trying to take Kherson, but we would argue that Kherson is actually contested territory again.""

If Ukrainian forces were to retake the port city, it ""would be a significant development, no question about that in terms of the southern part of the war,"" the official said. If that happened Russian troops would be ""sandwiched"" between Ukrainian forces in Mykolaiv to the west and Kherson, the official said.

""That would put them smack in the middle and that would make it very, very difficult for them to make any kind of ground movement on Odessa. If in fact, that was their plan,"" the official said.

Russian reinforcements headed to Ukraine from Georgia

""We've seen our first indications that they are trying to send in some reinforcements from Georgia,"" said the official. ""We have seen the movement of some number of troops from Georgia.

In recent days, U.S. officials have said that it appeared that Russia was seeking reinforcements for its military operations in Ukraine, but interestingly from outside of Russia.

""We don't have an exact number,"" said the official. ""I couldn't tell you whether it's a whole BTG (battalion tactical group) or how many troops.""

Russian troops have been in breakaway Russian areas of Georgia since 2008.

Russian missile failure rates between 20% and 60%

The senior U.S. defense official did not dispute press reports that Russian missiles are failing to launch between 20% and 60% of the time.

""It's hard for us to assess that perfectly in terms of numbers, but we have seen some failures,"" said the official.

""The ranges I've seen in the press from anywhere from 20 to 60%. I would not push back on that assessment,"" said the official.

""But again, it's a range, and it's very nearly from day to day, but we have seen times ... when our assessment is they have they have experienced a significant amount of failure in their missiles,"" the official added.

While the airspace over Ukraine remains contested, the official said that Russian planes are now flying about 300 sorties a day and are continuing to fire a lot of missiles that are causing their supplies to dwindle.

""They still have more than 50% but that's the air launch cruise missiles in particular the thing that they're running the lowest on,"" said the official.

Since the start of the war, Russia has fired more than 1,250 missiles into Ukraine.",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/apparent-shift-strategy-russians-troops-stop-offensive-kyiv/story?id=83676507
6,010666cd-3079-4770-8801-7ecafaa29d81,[],2022-03-09 09:30:55+05:30,"After 13 days of the Russia-Ukraine war, several cities and regions in Ukraine have fallen to Putin's invasion. Melitopol, Kherson, Berdyansk, Starobilsk, Novopskov are among the cities and regions that are currently under the control of Russian forces. But the residents continue to resist the “occupiers”.

In the southern Ukrainian city of Melitopol, the internet connection has all but disappeared, making it nearly impossible to reach people by WhatsApp or Telegram call, or stay connected for more than a few minutes.

Melitopol mayor Ivan Federov said that ordinary phones are no longer an option for them.

“We cannot use (phone lines), too easy for the Russians to listen in,” Federov was quoted as saying by BBC.

The Melitopol mayor claimed that the Russian forces occupying the city have taken control of the city’s communication network and warned that they need to be wary of what they hear on TV and radio.

Ivan Federov and his team have been exiled to another location following the Russian occupation of the city a week ago.

""We are not co-operating with the Russians in any way,"" Federov said emphatically. ""They have not tried to help us, they cannot help us, and we do not want their help.""

Non-stop protests in Russian-occupied Ukrainian cities

When Russian President Vladimir Putin declared war on Ukraine, he claimed that Moscow does not plan to occupy Ukraine. He claimed that the “military action” announced by him will seek to ""demilitarize"" Ukraine and came in response to threats from Ukraine.

""We decided to launch a special military action aimed at demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine,"" Putin had said in a televised address.

But in Melitopol and a string of other mainly Russian-speaking Ukrainian cities, Putin’s forces have found themselves treated as occupiers.

""There are protests in Melitopol every day,"" said 33-year-old Yuliya Kovaliova, who before the invasion helped run her family business of electronics stores.

""At some point, the Russian army started shooting at us and one man got shot, but we have not stopped protesting,"" Kovaliova said. ""We are not afraid to protest because we are together. We are afraid to walk alone at night, but we are not afraid to protest.""

Videos have surfaced showing protests in Kherson, Berdyansk, Starobilsk, Novopskov.

""I don't know how to count the number of people protesting, I thought it was 2,000 at least,"" said Yunona, a 29-year-old IT worker in the southern city of Kherson.

""One of our friends was beaten and taken by the Russian soldiers and people got so angry they chased the occupiers down the street and took him back,"" Yunona added.

Residents also claimed that the Russian forces looked young, uncertain, and afraid.

Olha, a 63-year-old English teacher, said, ""We go to the protests every day and they are close to us but they look afraid.""

""We are all just waiting for the Ukrainian army to kick them out,"" she added.

The mayors of the occupied cities are facing a dilemma- whether to encourage their citizens to take to streets, or warm them against going near Russian forces.

""Our people need to protest but they also need to save their lives,"" said Federov, the Melitopol mayor. ""I have asked them - please do not go near the Russian soldiers, go around them.""

Speaking to BBC, Vadym Gaev, the mayor of Novopskov, said that there had been daily protests but they had stopped three days ago when Russian soldiers shot three protestors - non-fatally - and beat another. Gaev said the Russian troops told an intermediary they had authorisation to shoot protesters, so there should be no more protests.

In Starobilsk, mayor Yana Litvinova was also working remotely.

""A new 'administration' has been appointed. The only thing we know is that it is going around government buildings and asking people to co-operate, and they are refusing,"" Litvinova said.

The mayors, who have left the city to keep the administration running are also facing increased criticism from the residents. Some accused them of betrayal while others said they were grateful hat the administration was still able to work.

Two residents of Kherson claimed that they thought the mayor there had betrayed the city by co-operating with Russian forces - an accusation circulating in Telegram chat groups.

""If I had betrayed the city would I still be here? I am in the office every day, working with my team to keep things running,"" Kherson mayor Igor Kolykhayev said.

The priority was to restart food production and get people back to work,

Kolykhayev emphasised that the priority in the current situation was to restart production and get people back to work.

""We are running out of food and there is no aid coming in, it's just not happening,"" he said. ""So we are telling everyone in the city: make any food you can make, manufacture anything you can manufacture.""

Residents in the Russian occupied cities have flagged the food scarcity, with shops fast running out.

""Shops are almost empty. You can buy the things that are left but very few things are left,"" said Yuliya Kovaliova, the electronics shop owner from Melitopol. ""Pharmacies are empty and my mother can't buy her heart medicine.""

Distrust of Russian ‘humanitarian convoy’

City residents in Melitopol, Kherson, and other places have described Russian “humanitarian convoys” that are attempting to hand out food, but filming the act for alleged propaganda.

ALSO READ: 13 days on, Ukraine still puts up resistance against Russia. Here's how

Kovaliova said that two Russian trucks with humanitarian markings came into Melitopol last week and attempted to hand out food, but they also brought a film crew.

Nearly everyone refused, she said.

""Later we saw on it on TV. Russia has taken over the TV towers here so we only have one Russian channel being shown now and it was showing people taking the food and saying how thankful they are to the Russian humanitarian convoy,"" Kovaliova said.

Maxim, a 22-year-old piano teacher in the city, also described the supposed humanitarian convoy.

""They were filming and people said actors arrived to take the food,"" he said.

Yunona, the IT worker in Kherson, said she saw the same thing there, and Ukrainian media reported on the phenomenon in Berdyansk.

Melitopol mayor Ivan Federov said he had heard about these 'humanitarian convoys' too. But there were ""no real Russian trucks and no real Russian food,"" he said.

""They could open humanitarian corridors at any time to allow food and medicine in, but they do not want to. We know, we have tried,"" Federov lamented.
