MYKOLAIV, Ukraine — Sergey was at the morgue to pick up the body of his baby brother. Then he walked into a room with corpses organized in rows on the floor. Most were dressed in military fatigues and mangled. Some were missing limbs. He wondered if he knew some of them, he said, but it’s hard to keep track of who is alive and who is dead these days.

“There must have been 200 in there,” said Sergey, a Ukrainian soldier. Like others in this report, The Washington Post is only identifying him by first name for security reasons and in keeping with military rules.

Ukraine’s southern front-line city of Mykolaiv is considered a success story for how its military has defended against Russia’s invasion. This is where Ukrainian forces have held their ground, delaying any Russian offensive on the strategically critical Black Sea port of Odessa. This is where they’ve even launched counterattacks to push back Russian troops. And this is where bodies continue to pile up.

While Ukrainian forces have inflicted punishing losses on the Russians, interviews this week at Mykolaiv’s front lines, funeral homes, morgues, cemeteries and residential neighborhoods illustrated the terrible price Ukraine has paid in lives lost.

Ukraine’s military has not released any casualty figures. But in Mykolaiv just this past week, Russian missiles struck a Ukrainian barracks, killing dozens. Blue-and-yellow flags around the city were lowered to half-staff. At the morgue, one van after another arrived with a “200” sign in the front windshield — an old Soviet marker for a vehicle transporting a corpse. Some bodies were delivered wrapped in checkered picnic blankets.

“Their methods of warfare are incomprehensible to a normal person — and a not normal person,” said Andriy, a Ukrainian sergeant who’s posted at one of the front-line positions in Mykolaiv. “They’re bombing peaceful cities. They’re bombing barracks with new recruits sleeping inside. But they won’t come storm our actual military positions.”

Meanwhile, Mykolaiv Gov. Vitaliy Kim has urged residents to notify local authorities when they come across “the many” Russian cadavers left strewn around the city’s outskirts. He said people could also just place the corpses in bags, which will eventually be shipped back to Russian mothers because “we’re not animals.”

“The problem is they don’t always take their bodies,” Kim said in a video message on Telegram on Saturday. “The dogs won’t eat that much. Same with the wolves.”

Dmitry Smirnov, who owns a funeral home in Mykolaiv, said the city of 500,000 typically sees about 20 deaths per day. At the height of the coronavirus pandemic, that jumped to 50 per day, he estimated. Now, Smirnov said, the city is dealing with more than 100 deaths per day — not counting the Russians.

His funeral home and others will soon reach a breaking point. He only has enough caskets to last until the end of this week. The wood to make them was typically sourced from forests in the Kherson region, which is now largely occupied by Russian forces. Some bodies might soon have to be buried in sealed bags.

At the cemetery, gravedigger Yuri Malashuk starts his days surveying the grounds for new artillery shells. At least one had landed there nearly every night since the start of the war, he said. Some have disturbed graves. Several fell on a nearby landfill, setting fire to the trash and causing pungent smoke to waft over the cemetery.

“Even the sacred places aren’t safe,” Malashuk said.

The near-constant booming thuds in the distance have scared some people away from coming to the graveyard, sacrificing saying goodbye for safety. In the past month, Malashuk has dug graves for whole families who had to be buried by their neighbors. He’s also dug solitary plots for men — left behind after their family members evacuated. Ukraine is requiring men between 18 and 60 to remain in the country to fight.

“I’m sorry for our guys. We are burying them every day,” he said.

Analysts at the Institute for the Study of War think tank have predicted that “if the war in Ukraine settles into a stalemate condition, Russian forces will continue to bomb and bombard Ukrainian cities, devastating them and killing civilians, even as Ukrainian forces impose losses on Russian attackers and conduct counterattacks of their own.”

With much of their artillery now out of range of Mykolaiv’s downtown, the Russian military on Monday dropped a bomb on a hotel, the first strike in the city center. No one was seriously injured in the blast — the hotel had been empty — but several apartment buildings behind it were damaged. Less than an hour after the explosion, residents were on the streets outside, working together to sweep up debris from their homes’ walls and windows.

Across the street from the hotel was another barracks for local law enforcement. When the bomb dropped, shattered glass flew onto their cots. Three officers sustained minor injuries. The unit’s commander, Oleksi, sat in the lobby with gauze wrapped around his hand and his knee. He considered himself more lucky than wounded.

“Russians are trying to intimidate the population,” he said. “It’s all psychological pressure to create panic.”

At the trenched front line the next day, soldiers sat around jars of borscht and cured lard that volunteers had brought them. They were waiting for the orders to move their trench positions forward, in the direction of the Russian military in Ukraine’s southeast.

A different unit, just one kilometer ahead, was hit with artillery shells overnight.

“They are more or less okay,” said Maksim, a soldier. “The losses aren’t big.”

“The enemy has suffered quite significant casualties, both the injured and the killed,” he added. “Well, this is what war is about.”

At the morgue, Sergey spoke of the toll of a month of war on his family and friends. He said his brother Danil was 17 when he died during a shootout with Russian troops. He had wanted to defend his country like his older brothers, so he joined the local Territorial Defense Forces. He was two days short of his 18th birthday when he died.

Sergey carpooled to the morgue with two other families from his neighborhood to pick up their dead together.

“How do I bring our mother her dead son right now?” he asked. “I just have no idea.”

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

The southern city is a key obstacle for Russian forces trying to move west from Crimea to take Odessa, Ukraine's major port on the Black Sea, and it has taken a battering in the more than three weeks since Russian troops invaded. However, citizens are determined to stay and defend it despite incessant bombardment.

Almost a month ago, Russia sent troops over the border on what it calls a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its neighbor's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists. The United Nations human rights office said on Tuesday it had recorded 953 civilian deaths, however, the Kremlin denies targeting civilians. Russian forces tried to storm Mykolaiv on March 4 but met with fierce resistance.

In the eastern Inhulskyi district of the city, an unexploded artillery rocket can be seen sticking up from the pavement, a traffic cone planted alongside it to warn motorists.

A bit further, in the city's vast cemetery, another unexploded rocket has burrowed into the ground nearly up to its fins. Smoke from burning garbage hangs in the air.

It's there that a dozen family and friends have gathered to bury Igor Dundukov, 46. He was killed along with dozens of other soldiers last Friday, when the military barracks came under fire. His elder brother, Sergei, weeps as he kisses Dundukov's swollen, blood-stained face.

Sergei's wife, Galina, slips a crucifix into a pocket of Dundukov's fatigues before the coffin is sealed and lowered into the ground. Igor enlisted at the start of the invasion, Sergei told Agence France-Presse (AFP).

""We supported his commitment to defending our homeland,"" he added, dismissing any idea of leaving the city despite the boom of artillery fire in the distance.

""This is our land. We live here. And where would we run to? Where would we run to? We grew up here.""

Galina agreed. ""We were born here and grew up here. And we don't have anywhere else to go. No relatives abroad. No-one.""

If a good part of the city's 500,000 prewar residents have fled – mostly towards Odessa, some 130 kilometers (80 miles) to the southwest – those that remain are determined to hold out.

In the afternoon, an airstrike gutted a building. Witnesses say it was a hotel with a bank branch on the ground floor. Several hundred meters away, Anatoly Yakunin, 79, calmly picked up debris and sweeps broken glass.

""Leave? But to do what?"" he asked. ""I have four grandchildren here, one who is fighting. How could I leave them?""

In the Kulbakino district, which includes several blocks of residential buildings, the population has fallen from 12,000 to fewer than 1,000, according to Alexander Zadera. The 56-year-old had to pull his octogenarian mother from her apartment after the building was struck on March 7.

""We've got used to eating with that sort of background noise,"" he said of the fighting at the nearby front. ""Now even my mother recognizes the sounds of different types of artillery and missile fire,"" the former air force colonel added wryly.

The building's residents have set themselves up in the basement for the duration. At the back, between two mattresses, a game of backgammon has been left waiting while the residents share tea in the candle-lit main room.

""We pass our evenings here praying for our soldiers, our homeland,"" said schoolteacher Inna Kouriy. ""Every time there is a raid or a strike, we come down here. And when things calm down we go back up, and so on,"" she adds.

Kouriy tries to organize remote classes for her students who have left the city or the country. ""There were quite a few of us here at the beginning but many left the city because they had children or family. But we're staying until the end,"" she says. ""We Ukrainians are patient people but we won't give our country up to anyone.""

Every little bit helps

The courtyard of the psychiatric hospital in Mykolaiv reverberates with the sound of broken glass being swept up by staff and volunteers. Every day, residents clean up the debris from the latest bombardment by the Russian army and prepare for the next.

Using whatever resources they can lay their hands on, they are just some of those trying to do their bit to support the Ukrainian forces who have so far frustrated the Russian push towards Odessa.

Nurse Svetlana Muraska, her eyes red from crying, weeps anew as she sees the crater that has appeared in front of the women's detoxification center at the hospital. The center's facade has also been blown away in the blast.

But despite the damage, the strike caused no casualties, Oleg Kondratenko, a manager at the facility, told AFP. ""The patients of the psychiatric hospital are in other buildings that were not hit,"" he said.

In the main courtyard, staff and a handful of young volunteers were working to clear away the most visible traces of the bombardment, sweeping and picking up the shattered glass.

""Faced with the Russian aggression, we have to participate in some way,"" said one young volunteer in a black beanie and down jacket. ""I want to join the territorial defense corps, but they don't have enough weapons for everyone, so for now I'm helping out like this,"" he added. ""We have to clean everything because they can bomb again and if there is still broken glass lying around it will be even more dangerous.""

""Yesterday we cleaned a warehouse and protected the windows with tape,"" he added. ""I'm a handyman, I need to do something and I'm more useful here,"" he said, before the hospital manager interrupted him and prevents him from giving his name or saying more for security reasons.

Oleg Yarshenko, a road maintenance worker in peacetime, and his wife Lilia drove around the area in a brown van, asking those manning security checkpoints what they need and, if possible, supplying it.

He can offer them ""firewood, cigarettes and food,"" but also medicines and sleeping bags, said the 54-year-old, sporting a straggly beard and walking with a cane.

The company he works for also has lorries ferrying supplies to surrounding villages whose access roads have been destroyed, said Yarshenko, whose children fled to Bulgaria a few days ago.

""You have to be totally mentally deranged to start a war in the 21st century,"" he said of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

In the car park of a supermarket, one of the city's remaining businesses, Nikolai Oskchik, a 69-year-old widower, was also making his modest contribution to the war effort.

With the help of a deaf-mute friend, he spread out a jumble of bric-a-brac – hoover parts, kitchen accessories and other utensils – on the bonnet of his blue Moskvitch car, a 37-year-old Soviet antique. He said he gives his wares to the military, or sells them to troops ""at half price"" to buy himself medicine.

""I'm too old to fight,"" sighed Oskchik, the father of a military nurse. ""But at least I can do this for them.""

Stress prompts baby boom

Just minutes old, baby Katya lies on her mother Tamara Kravchuk's chest, unaware of the joy and solace she has brought. It is a moment of bliss and gratitude, despite the war raging close by.

""I'm so happy. No matter what happens now – I'm the happiest person ... my daughter is healthy. God willing there will be peace,"" 37-year-old Kravchuk, lying in a hospital bed in Mykolaiv, told Reuters.

Staring at her new daughter's face and tiny hands, she talks of the future. The desperation and anxiety that dominated her thoughts before Katya's birth are gone – for now.

""I think the war will end and we will live as it was before, our life will be calm again,"" said Kravchuk. ""I hope our children won't see all these crazy things and everything will be good.""

The head of the maternity ward, Valentin Podaranchuk, was all smiles after delivering Katya. ""A new life is born, despite all the horrors happening around,"" said the 39-year-old. ""That's why we still have hope. Today a new little girl came to our world.""

The Russian invasion brought a wave of new births in Mykolaiv, as women went into labor through stress, said Podaranchuk. Katya is baby 49 since the war began on Feb. 24.

""During the first 10 days we had a baby boom – a lot of births. I think this is because of a lot of stress ... It was very unusual.""

Now the birth rate is back to normal for the hospital, but many people have fled the city.

Before having Katya, Kravchuk had been fearful, especially when there were explosions 500 meters (yards) from the hospital, she said.

Speaking on condition of anonymity, the senior NATO military official, who spoke with the Wall Street Journal, also claimed that between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian troops have been killed since the start of Russia’s attack on Ukraine.

Task & Purpose has verified that NATO and the United States have different assessments of how many casualties the Russians have taken. Separately, a senior defense official told reporters during a Pentagon press briefing on Wednesday that he had not seen any estimates for Russian casualties that were so high.

“We continue to have low confidence in those estimates, because we’re not on the ground, we can’t see, you know, what’s really going on, on a day-to-day basis,” the senior defense official said.

History has shown us that estimates of combat losses, known as body counts, are often far from reliable because they are vulnerable to all sorts of distortions caused by the fog of war, wishful thinking, outright lying, and other factors. Retired Army Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, who led U.S. and allied troops during the Persian Gulf War, told Life Magazine in 1992 that the U.S. military’s use of body counts during the Vietnam War was “a big lie” that he was forced to participate in.

“Many times people would call me up on the radio after a battle and say, ‘What was your body count,’” Schwarzkopf said in the interview. “I’d say, ‘I don’t know what the body count was.’ They’d say, ‘Well, make one up. We have to report a body count.’”

Yet the NATO official’s estimate is relatively close to the casualty figures recently published by a pro-Kremlin Russian tabloid. Komsomolskaya Pravda reported on March 20 that 9,861 Russian troops had been killed in Ukraine and another 16,153 were wounded. The figures were attributed to Russia’s defense ministry. But those figures were later removed from the story and the newspaper claimed it had been hacked.

Going back to the days of the Soviet Union, Russia has traditionally been extremely secretive about combat losses. During the Soviet-Afghan War from 1979 to 1989, the bodies of killed Soviet soldiers were delivered to their families inside sealed zinc coffins in the middle of the night. Their headstones would read that they had been killed while fulfilling their internationalist duty — with no mention of Afghanistan.

While the Soviet Union officially estimated that 15,000 of its troops had been killed in Afghanistan, the Russian general staff subsequently assessed that more than 26,000 Soviet soldiers had died during the 10-year conflict, according to “The Soviet-Afghan War,” translated by Lester Grau and Michael Gress.

So, it should come as no surprise that the Russian defense ministry’s only public comment about combat losses in Ukraine put the number of Russian troops killed at 498, much lower than NATO’s estimate and Ukraine’s claim that 15,600 Russian troops have died. Neither claims could be independently verified.

It is worth treating both Russian and Ukrainian statements about the number of Russian troops killed with a degree of skepticism because both countries are waging an information war in addition to the ones being conducted on the ground and in the air. Ukraine has every incentive to inflate the number of Russia casualties and the Russians are similarly motivated to claim their losses have been negligible.

Meanwhile, Russia’s foreign ministry announced on Thursday that the war in Ukraine “is going according to plan” — even though a senior defense official said the day before that the Ukrainians had pushed the Russians roughly 25 kilometers back from the east of Kyiv.

To Joseph Chase, a Marine veteran fighting with the Ukrainians in Mykolaiv, the Russian invasion does not seem to be going according to plan at all. “The Russians are taking heavy losses,” he told Task & Purpose. “They seem to be at a ground war stalemate. They have not yet pushed my position. They tried a bit ago and got fucked — and no attempt since.”

Local authorities say 80% of the city’s infrastructure has been destroyed, some of it beyond repair. The city has been without water, electricity and heating, and it is impossible to count the number of deaths. This week Ukraine rejected Russia’s ultimatum to surrender Mariupol.

The fall of Mariupol would be an economic blow to Ukraine and a symbolic victory for Russia.

“Mariupol has a practical and symbolic significance for Russia,” Andrii Ianitskyi, the head of the centre for excellence in economic journalism at Kyiv School of Economics, told the Guardian.

“It is a large port city and a base for Ukrainian armed forces. So if Russians want to have a land corridor [from the Donbas] to Crimea, they need to control the city.”

Since 2014, less than 30km has separated Mariupol from the Russian-controlled separatist territories in the Donbas.

Economic strangulation

Mariupol is a metallurgical centre for iron and steelworks, heavy machinery manufacturing, and ship repairs. Ukraine’s largest steel plants owned by the country’s leading metallurgical group, Metinvest, are located in Mariupol. One of them, Azovstal, was badly damaged by Russian shelling this week.

Ianitskyi said the Russian army had been targeting not only civilian infrastructure but also the economic infrastructure, with the aim of incurring as much damage as possible.

Mariupol is also home to the largest trading port in the Azov Sea from which Ukraine exports grain, iron and steel, and heavy machinery. In 2021, the main destinations for Ukrainian exports from Mariupol port were European and Middle Eastern countries such as Italy, Lebanon, and Turkey.

The port had suffered after the start of the Donbas war, having lost transit cargo traffic from former markets, including Russia. After the annexation of Crimea, Russia built a bridge connecting the peninsula to its mainland and unilaterally imposed restrictions for ships passing the Kerch Strait.

Symbolism and propaganda

There was also a symbolic significance, Ianitskyi said. In 2014, Mariupol, the second-largest city in the Donetsk region, withstood brief occupation by pro-Russian forces. After Ukraine lost control over the regional capital of Donetsk, Mariupol hosted the largest number of internally displaced people from the occupied parts of the Donbas, more than 96,000 people as of 2019.

Not only does Mariupol lie in the territory that is claimed by the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic, an area recognised by Russia before the full-scale invasion, but it is also part of Vladimir Putin’s vision of “Novorossiya” – a territory stretching across eastern and southern Ukraine along the Black Sea coastline that is viewed by Putin as “historically Russian lands”.

Capturing Mariupol would also be a huge win for Kremlin propaganda, which portrays Ukraine as governed by Nazis and the war as “de-Nazification”. The city has been a base of the Azov battalion, a former paramilitary unit with roots in far-right and neo-Nazi groups. Although they form the tiniest fraction of Ukraine’s national guard, Russian propaganda has claimed Azov fighters were responsible for killings of civilians and destruction in Mariupol.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/22/mariupol-important-russian-forces-moscow-port-city

Western sources said it was still possible that Russian forces could regroup to make new assaults despite what appears to be a string of military setbacks.

Here is a summary of the situation on the ground, based on statements from both sides, Western defence and intelligence sources, and international organisations.

The east

There was little movement around the mostly encircled city of Kharkiv which Russia has bombed heavily after attempts to capture it were thwarted.

That city would be a key link in the chain if Russia aims -- as many analysts believe -- to encircle Ukrainian forces in the country's east.

The city of Sumy further to the north and close to the Russian border is also encircled.

Kyiv and the north

Russians have been reinforcing their positions around the capital, which has not yet been fully surrounded and has been subjected to heavy bombardment on occasion.

There were also reports of Ukrainian forces launching counterattacks against Russian forces on the outskirts of the city.

The British defence ministry said the battlefield across northern Ukraine is ""largely static"" with Russian forces ""likely conducting a period of reorganisation before resuming large-scale offensive operations.""

Chernihiv to the east of the capital is meanwhile encircled by Russian troops.

The south

Russia continued its siege of the port city of Mariupol, a key Russian target to link up the annexed Crimea and separatist-controlled Donbas regions.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said the city still has nearly 100,000 people living in inhumane conditions.

A US defense official said Russian troops had been seen inside Mariupol but the ""Ukrainians are fighting very hard to keep Mariupol from falling"".

Russian forces earlier in the campaign took the city of Kherson just north of Crimea, the only major city they have captured so far.

Although Russian troops are trying to push west along Ukraine's Black Sea coast towards Odessa, they have so far failed to encircle the city of Mykolayiv that stands in the way.

There is Russian naval activity in the Black Sea off Odessa but this does not mean that an amphibious assault on the city is imminent, according to the US Defense Department.

The west and centre

After deadly airstrikes in Ukraine's west last week, there have been no reports of significant military action in the region or around Dnipro.

The west of Ukraine, including the region's main city of Lviv, is still far from the ground offensive but has been the target of air strikes.

Casualties

According to the office for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, at least 953 civilians have been confirmed killed in Ukraine, including 78 children. It warns this is likely an underestimate.

Moscow has given no toll for casualties among its armed forces since announcing on March 2 that 498 troops had been killed.

Ukraine says around 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed. Western sources generally give a lower figure but still numbering several thousand.

Kyiv has also not given an update on the number of Ukrainian soldiers killed since Zelensky announced a week ago that around 1,300 were dead.

Refugees

The war has sparked Europe's worst refugee crisis since World War II, according to the UN refugee agency.

More than 3.6 million refugees have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion, with more than two million of them heading to neighbouring Poland, according to the UN.

A total of 10 million are believed to have fled their homes, according to the world body, representing over a quarter of the population in regions under government control.
