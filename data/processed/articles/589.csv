President Biden on Tuesday announced a ban on U.S. imports of Russian oil and gas — the latest move to try to punish Moscow for invading Ukraine.

""The United States is targeting the main artery of Russia's economy,"" Biden said. ""That means Russian oil will no longer be acceptable at U.S. ports, and the American people will deal another powerful blow to Putin's war machine.""

The ban also applies to U.S. imports of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG), products made from oil, and coal. New purchases are to be ceased immediately, but U.S. buyers with existing contracts for Russian energy have 45 days to wind down deliveries.

Biden called the prohibition a critical step to punishing Russian President Vladimir Putin but said as a result, Americans should be prepared to face further price hikes at the pump.

Already, the cost to fuel up has spiked since the early days of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, leading to historic gas prices across the country.

""Defending freedom is going to cost. It's going to cost us as well in the United States,"" Biden said.

Biden pledged to do ""everything I can to minimize Putin's price hike here at home"" and said that lifting environmental regulations would not boost domestic energy production.

Instead, he said that oil and gas companies have leased millions of acres of U.S. land and received permits to drill but have decided not to use them for production.

""They can be drilling right now, yesterday, last week, last year,"" he said.

After Biden's address, a senior White House official said the Biden administration plans to continue working with major energy consumers to consider releasing more emergency reserves — and will continue urging oil producers with spare capacity to produce more oil.

But the move to cut off Russian oil reserves has redoubled the administration's push to wind down Western dependence on fossil fuels altogether.

The official said the United States and allies need to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and transition to more renewable sources of energy to avoid this kind of situation in the future, despite the short-term push to pump more oil.

The ban marks a divergence in U.S. sanctions from those of its allies and partners

Until now, Washington had worked in lockstep with European allies to carve out exceptions to its banking sanctions for energy transactions, recognizing the potential for disruptions to hike prices for consumers.

Biden said he made the decision after communication with U.S. allies, particularly those in Europe, and he realized many of Russia's buyers did not have the energy resources to cut off oil from Moscow.

""We will not be part of subsidizing Putin's war,"" Biden said. ""We can take this step when others cannot.""

Europe imports six times more oil from Russia than the United States does.

The White House had initially resisted the move, saying it was trying to avoid actions that would reduce global energy supplies or push up prices for Western consumers even more. ""We don't have a strategic interest in reducing the global supply of energy,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters last week.

A senior U.S. administration official on Tuesday told reporters that the United States had not asked its allies to adopt a similar ban, but the official declined to say whether allies asked the White House to not take this step.

The cut-off extends to the financial sector as well. Americans are now banned from investing in Russia's energy sector, including through foreign consortiums that may invest in the country.

There was a bipartisan push from Congress for the ban

Even though the United States counts on Russian oil for less than 10% of its imports, those sales were too much for many Democrats and Republicans in Congress, who pushed for the ban — which was among the requests for assistance from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a video call with U.S. lawmakers over the weekend.

""We are going to continue to consult with, continue to convey where our plans, where our discussions are here internally with the Europeans,"" Psaki said on Monday ahead of the announcement. ""But I would look at it through a different prism than past coordinated efforts.""

Oil and gas prices have soared

Oil prices hit a 14-year high on Monday ahead of the announcement, and U.S. gasoline prices have now hit a record. The AAA puts the national average at $4.17 per gallon, topping the previous high of $4.11 in 2008.

Even before Russia invaded Ukraine, inflation — at its highest level in decades — had become the top issue on the minds of voters ahead of elections this November that will determine whether Democrats hold on to their narrow majority in Congress.

""The decision today is not without cost here at home. Putin's war is already hurting American families at the gas pump,"" Biden said Tuesday.

Biden had strong words for oil and gas companies, as well as the financial firms backing them, saying that while energy prices will rise with the ban, it is ""no excuse to exercise excessive price increases or padding profits.""

About the current state of the invasion, Biden said, ""This much is already clear: Ukraine will never be a victory for Putin.""

U.S. officials have talked to Saudi Arabia and Venezuela about energy

American officials have been working behind the scenes to try to boost global energy supplies, starting during the weeks leading up to the invasion. The United States and other major energy consumers also jointly released emergency stocks of oil to try to take the edge off markets.

U.S. officials visited Saudi Arabia to try to urge the kingdom to pump more oil. And talks aimed at reviving the Iran nuclear deal have led to optimism that it could also lead to a resumption in trade for barrels of Iranian oil kept off the market by sanctions.

Over the weekend, U.S. officials took the extraordinary step of visiting Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro — a heavily sanctioned authoritarian leader whom Washington does not even recognize as the country's legitimate president — to talk about energy security. The United States has sanctions blocking dealings with the country's oil company and central banks. Most of Venezuela's remaining oil exports are going to India and China, with help from Russia.",https://www.npr.org/2022/03/08/1085089048/biden-ban-imports-russia-oil

""That means Russian oil will no longer be acceptable at U.S. ports and the American people will deal another powerful blow to Putin's war machine.""

The move came as Western-allied nations work to sever Russia from the global economy to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for his unprovoked aggression.

President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced the U.S. will ban imports of Russian oil, a major escalation in the international response to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine .

The United Kingdom announced its own restrictions on buying Russian oil imports just before Biden spoke, saying it will phase out the country's imports by the end of the year. The European Union earlier Tuesday morning unveiled a plan to wean itself off of Russian fossil fuels.

""We simply cannot rely on a supplier who explicitly threatens us,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a press release announcing the plan.

The White House said in a fact sheet that Biden will sign an executive order banning Russian oil, liquefied natural gas and coal imports to the U.S.

The ban on new Russian oil contracts ""is immediate,"" a senior Biden administration official told reporters later Tuesday.

No new contracts will be allowed, and existing contracts for Russian oil must be phased out within 45 days, the official said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy applauded Biden's move on Twitter later Tuesday.

""Thankful for US and @POTUS personal leadership in striking in the heart of Putin's war machine and banning oil, gas and coal from US market,"" he said in a post. ""Encourage other countries and leaders to follow.""

The U.S. imported about 672,000 barrels a day from Russia in 2021, according to figures from the Energy Information Administration. That amount makes up roughly 8% of the total U.S. imports of oil and refined products.

Most of the country's crude oil and petroleum imports come from Canada, Mexico and Saudi Arabia, making the U.S. far less dependent on Russian oil than many of its European partners.

The news of the ban, confirmed to CNBC by two people familiar with the matter before Biden's speech, sent oil prices soaring Tuesday morning.

The price on West Texas Intermediate crude futures, contracts for April oil deliveries, hit $129.44 a barrel. That level is just below a recent high of $130.50 a barrel hit on Monday, which at the time was the highest price on oil futures since 2008.

Putin's actions have provoked an unprecedented international reaction, as dozens of countries slap crippling sanctions on the Kremlin, its ultra-rich oligarchs and even Putin himself.

3,e9ca1580-fab6-4326-a36e-c44841f22614,"['Social Links For Steven Nelson', 'Social Links For Samuel Chamberlain']",2022-03-08 00:00:00,"President Biden announced a ban on Russian energy imports Tuesday after a bipartisan coalition in Congress threatened to force his hand to punish Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

“Today I’m announcing the United States is targeting the main artery of Russia’s economy. We’re banning all imports of Russian oil and gas and energy,” Biden said in remarks from the White House Roosevelt Room.

“Russian oil will no longer be acceptable at US ports and the American people will deal another powerful blow to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s war machine.”

“This is a step that we’re taking to inflict further pain on Putin, but there will be costs as well here in the United States,” Biden warned as US gas prices hit an all-time high of $4.17 per gallon on average.

The president, speaking before a trip to Fort Worth, Texas to discuss veteran healthcare, also defended his own energy policies, which Republicans say contributed to rising fuel costs.

“It’s simply not true that my administration or policies are holding back domestic energy production, that’s simply not true,” said Biden, who canceled construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline last year and attempted to halt new drilling permits on public land.

“We’re approaching record levels of oil and gas production in the United States and we’re on track to set a record for production next year … The oil and gas industry has millions of acres leased. They have 9,000 permits to drill now. They could be drilling right now, yesterday, last week, last year.”

Biden then admonished oil companies, saying there was “no excuse to exercise excessive price increases or padding profits or any kind of effort to exploit the situation.”

The president’s insistence that his own policies were not “holding back domestic energy production” drew swift GOP pushback.

Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.) tweeted, “@POTUS this you?” with a link to Biden’s 2021 executive order that sought to curtail new oil exploration.

Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt tweeted, “Joe Biden is lying — although I won’t hold my breath for ‘fact checkers’ to correct him.” Schmitt urged Biden to take a variety of steps to boost domestic production, including allowing pipeline construction and new drilling.

In his speech, Biden also called for further development of electric vehicles — echoing Monday remarks from Vice President Kamala Harris that were panned by Republicans for being “tone deaf.”

“Transforming our economy to run on electric vehicles powered by clean energy — with tax credits to help American families winterize their homes and use less energy — that will help and if we can and we do what we can, it will mean that no one has to worry about price of gas pump in the future,” Biden said.

“That will mean tyrants like Putin won’t be able to use fossil fuels as weapons against other nations and it will make America a world leader in manufacturing and exporting clean energy technologies of the future, to countries all around the world.”

Biden took no questions from reporters and did not address reports that his administration is seeking to cozy up to the despotic leaders of Iran and Venezuela to alleviate potential global fuel shortages.

Billionaire John Catsimatidis, who owns about 400 gas stations in the New York City area as well as an oil refinery in western Pennsylvania, slammed Biden administration overtures to Venezuela.

“If we are going to buy from Venezuela instead of Russia, this is basically only a subsidiary of Russia,” Catsimatidis told The Post. “If Russia is calling the shots on Venezuela, and Russia and Saudi Arabia are working in concert, we are still making foreign countries rich and American people poorer. We must have an alliance between Mexico, Canada, and the United States as the North American Energy Alliance.”

The White House announced the speech shortly after reporting emerged that Biden frantically called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) Monday night to plead with her to table legislation to force an import ban.

An administration staffer called Pelosi’s office at around 6:30 p.m. Monday and urged her to stop the House Ways and Means Committee from advancing a bill to ban Russian oil, Jacqui Heinrich of Fox News reported.

Pelosi was “not moved by their arguments,” a source told Heinrich, and “told the WH staff they would be pushing ahead – so around 9:30 last night President Biden himself called Pelosi and asked her not to do it,” but again failed to sway her.

Spokespeople for Pelosi and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the speaker’s reported snub of Biden.

It’s the third time that Biden resisted a major set of sanctions in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion — only to adopt them in response to bipartisan pressure.

As recently as Monday afternoon, White House press secretary Jen Psaki was telling White House reporters that “no decision has been made at this point by the president” about an import ban.

Biden initially announced limited sanctions against state-owned Russian banks and certain Russian businessmen when tanks rolled across Ukraine’s borders on Feb, 24. After criticism, Biden sanctioned Putin’s vast personal wealth and reached an agreement with US allies to partially unplug Russia from the SWIFT international banking system.

Pelosi last week endorsed an oil import ban bill pushed by Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) — all but ensuring it had enough support to sail through Congress.

Rep. Tom Suozzi (D-NY), who helped lead the House push to ban Russian oil, told The Post it was “the right thing to do” and that “we all have to pull together to stop this madman,” referring to Putin.

Meanwhile, the top Democrats and Republicans on House and Senate committees that oversee trade announced legislation Monday that would both bar Russian energy imports and suspend normal trade with Moscow and its close ally Belarus.

In what could serve as a face-saving measure for Biden and a potential cudgel against Republicans, the House is expected to vote Tuesday afternoon on a bill that would effectively endorse Biden’s executive order, which also forbids the importation of coal and natural gas from Russia and bans US investment in Russia’s energy sector.

Biden acted after some Democrats expressed outrage that restrictions weren’t put in place earlier as Russia’s military moved to encircle Ukraine’s capital and largest city, Kyiv, amid reports of significant civilian casualties in the battle for the country’s second-largest city, Kharkiv.

Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) told reporters Monday that the Senate should pass legislation this month to ban Russian imports.

“The sooner, the better,” Durbin said, adding in reference to the White House: “I hope they come around to support the legislation.”

“It is so obviously apparent that we need to cut it off,” Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) told NBC News last week. “I wonder if there’s a reason we haven’t [and] what the hell the reason is.”

High gas prices generally are bad news politically for leaders in power and Republicans say Biden bears some of the blame because of his actions to scrap pipeline projects and seek to curtail new drilling.

“Unleash AMERICAN energy,” Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) tweeted Tuesday.

But Psaki repeatedly attempted to lay the blame on oil companies for not drilling more domestically and said Monday that the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada into the US would not help alleviate pain at the pump.

“The Keystone was not an oil field, it’s a pipeline. Also the oil is continuing to flow in, just through other means, so it actually would have nothing to do with the current supply imbalance,” she said.

The US imported about 209,000 barrels of oil from Russia per day in 2021, about 3 percent of its total intake, according to the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers. The US imported 500,000 barrels per day of other petroleum products from Russia, the association said.

NATO allies in Europe did not announce their own bans Tuesday on Russian oil and natural gas, which comprise a larger share of their domestic energy consumption. Much of Europe’s fuel supply traverses Ukrainian pipelines.

On Monday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz acknowledged that “Europe’s supply of energy for heat generation, mobility, power supply and industry cannot be secured in any other way” except with Russian fuel.

But British ambassador to the US Karen Pierce said Tuesday morning that her country may join the oil ban.

“The UK is in a different position because so little of our supplies actually come from Russia,” Pierce said in a Fox News interview. “So we’re looking to see what we can do. The Germans have of course canceled [the] Nord Stream [2 natural gas pipeline from Russia] but for the reasons the chancellor has set out, they have a very different picture at home.”

The White House previously resisted cutting off Russian energy by noting that it could cause the price of US gasoline to increase, in turn exacerbating already soaring inflation, which is at a 40-year high.",https://nypost.com/2022/03/08/biden-set-to-ban-russian-energy-imports-after-bipartisan-pressure/

The major trade action, responding to the pleas of Ukraine’s embattled leader, thrust the U.S. out front as Western nations seek to halt Putin’s invasion.

Americans will feel pain, too — at the gas pump — Biden acknowledged, declaring, “Defending freedom is going to cost.”

The imports have been a glaring omission in the massive sanctions put in place on Russia over the invasion. Energy exports have kept a steady stream of cash flowing to Russia despite otherwise severe restrictions on its financial sector.

“We will not be part of subsidizing Putin’s war,” Biden said, calling the new action a “powerful blow” against Russia's ability to fund the ongoing offensive.

Biden said the U.S. was acting in close consultation with European allies, who are more dependent on Russian energy supplies and who he acknowledged may not be able to join in immediately. The announcement marked the latest Biden attempt at cutting off Russia from much of the global economy and ensuring that the Ukraine invasion is a strategic loss for Putin, even if he manages to seize territory.

“Ukraine will never be a victory for Putin,” Biden said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a tweet praised Biden's action: ""Thankful for US and @POTUS personal leadership in striking in the heart of Putin’s war machine and banning oil, gas and coal from US market. Encourage other countries and leaders to follow.”

The European Union this week will commit to phasing out its reliance on Russia for energy needs as soon as possible, but filling the void without crippling EU economies will likely take some time. The U.K., which is no longer part of the EU, announced Tuesday that oil and oil products from Russia will be phased out by the end of the year.

Unlike the U.S., which is a major oil and gas producer, Europe relies on imports for 90% of its gas and 97% of its oil products. Russia supplies 40% of Europe’s gas and a quarter of its oil. The U.S. does not import Russian natural gas.

The issue of oil sanctions has created a conflict for the president between political interests at home and efforts to impose costs on Russia. Though Russian oil makes up only a small part of U.S. imports, Biden has said he was reluctant to ban it, cutting into supplies here and pushing gasoline prices higher.

Inflation is at a 40-year peak, fueled in large part by gas prices, and that could hurt Biden heading into the November midterm elections.

“Putin’s war is already hurting American families at the gas pump,” Biden said, adding, “I’m going to do everything I can to minimize Putin’s price hike here at home.”

Gas prices have been rising for weeks due to the conflict and in anticipation of potential sanctions on the Russian energy sector. The average price for a gallon of gasoline in the U.S. hit a record $4.17 Tuesday, rising by 10 cents in one day, and up 55 cents since last week, according to auto club AAA.

Biden said it was understandable that prices were rising, but cautioned the U.S. energy industry against “excessive price increases” and exploiting consumers.

Even before the U.S. ban many Western energy companies including ExxonMobil and BP moved to cut ties with the Russia and limit imports. Shell, which purchased a shipment of Russian oil this weekend, apologized for the move on Tuesday amid international criticism and pledged to halt further purchases of Russian energy supplies. Preliminary data from the U.S. Energy Department shows imports of Russian crude dropped to zero in the last week in February.

In 2021, the U.S. imported roughly 245 million barrels of crude oil and petroleum products from Russia — a one-year increase of 24%, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

“It’s an important step to show Russia that energy is on the table,” said Max Bergmann, a former State Department official who is now a senior fellow at the Democratic-leaning Center for American Progress.

Bergmann said it wasn’t surprising that the U.S. was able to take this step before European nations, which are more dependent on Russian energy.

“All of this is being done in coordination, even if the steps are not symmetrical,” he said. “We are talking to them constantly.”

The White House said the ban on new purchases was effective immediately but the administration was allowing a 45-day “wind down” for continued delivery under existing contracts.

The news of Biden's decision Tuesday was first reported by Bloomberg.

""Fossil fuels make us all vulnerable...to these geopolitical crises and shocks,"" says Selwin Hart, the Special Adviser to the U.N. Secretary-General focusing on climate. With the Russian invasion of Ukraine causing a stir in the energy market, it's time to transition more rapidly into renewable energy, Hart says. He talked more about the world's energy future and the U.N. IPCC report on climate change, which warns of worsening natural disasters caused by emissions.

The White House announcement comes amid bipartisan pressure on Capitol Hill to ban Russian energy and impose other economic costs.

Last week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gave a big boost when she declared, “Ban it.""

On Monday, Democrats on the powerful Ways & Means Committee posted, then removed, an announcement on a bipartisan bill to ban Russian oil imports and slap further trade sanctions on the country, according to an aide, because of pushback from the White House against acting before Biden had made his decision.

“President Biden is finally doing what members of Congress have been pushing for all along,” Sen John Barrasso, R-Wyo., and a member of party leadership, said Tuesday. “His decision to ban Russian oil is a much-needed step to kill Putin’s cash cow.""

Said Jason Furman, a Harvard professor and former economic adviser to President Barack Obama: “The United States economy can fully handle any of the challenges associated with higher oil prices. But it will bring some challenges. We’re going to have higher prices at the pump, and there’s no way around that.”

Pelosi said the House would go forward with a vote Tuesday on legislation to ban the Russian oil imports, impose trade costs on Russia and expand sanctions authority against Russians for attacks on civilians in Ukraine.

But late Tuesday, the House pushed back a vote on the bill amid disagreements among lawmakers over details. The House was expected to vote on the bill Wednesday, according to an aide granted anonymity to discuss the situation.

Before the invasion, Russian oil and gas made up more than a third of government revenues. Global energy prices have surged after the invasion and have continued to rise despite coordinated releases of strategic reserves, making Russian exports even more lucrative.

As a consequence of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. and international partners have sanctioned Russia’s largest banks, its central bank and finance ministry, and moved to block certain financial institutions from the SWIFT messaging system for international payments.

But the rules issued by the Treasury Department allow Russian energy transactions to keep going through non-sanctioned banks that are not based in the U.S. in an effort to minimize any disruptions to the global energy markets.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said he opposes a European ban on Russian energy imports and that there’s no other way to meet the European Union’s needs for motor fuel, heat and electricity, and industrial use. Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck said Tuesday that when he visited Washington last week, U.S. officials acknowledged Europe was in a different situation.

“They told me in the talks that they will neither demand nor ask that Germany do the same. But I would extrapolate from that for us, and for me, that we need as soon as possible to create the possibility to take similar measures.”

While Russian oil makes up a small amount of overall U.S. energy imports, the U.S. could replace Russian crude with imports from other oil-rich nations, but that could prove politically problematic.

Key U.S. senators are warning the Biden administration from seeking any oil import deal from the Nicolas Maduro regime in Venezuela.

“The Biden administration’s efforts to unify the entire world against a murderous tyrant in Moscow should not be undercut by propping up a dictator under investigation for crimes against humanity in Caracas,” said Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, in a statement late Monday. “The democratic aspirations of the Venezuelan people, much like the resolve and courage of the people of Ukraine, are worth much more than a few thousand barrels of oil.”

“Today, I’m announcing the U.S. is targeting the main artery of Russia’s economy,” Biden said. “We’re banning all imports of Russian oil, gas and energy.

“The American people will deal another powerful blow to Putin’s war machine.”

Biden said international economic sanctions in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are pummeling the Russian economy and have helped drive the value of the country’s currency, the ruble, down by 50%.

But Russian energy exports have not, until now, been targeted as a part of sanctions, thanks in large part to Europe’s heavy dependence on Russian energy imports. Biden noted the ban is, for the time being, a unilateral move by the U.S.

“We’re moving forward with this ban understanding that many of our European allies and partners may not be in a position to join us,” Biden said. “This is a step that we’re taking to inflict further pain on Putin, but there will be costs as well here in the U.S.”

Biden said he believes the ban has bipartisan support in Congress and among the American people.

Some members of Utah’s congressional delegation applauded the Biden ban but noted more needs to be done on development of domestic energy resources, including in Utah.

The decision is likely to drive further U.S. price increases at the consumer level. On Tuesday, AAA reported the average price of gas in the U.S. reached an all-time high of $4.17, surpassing the previous high of $4.11 set in 2008. The average price per gallon of gas in Utah was $4.01 on Tuesday, according to AAA.

Biden’s move follows pleas by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to U.S. and Western officials to cut off the imports, which had been a glaring omission in the massive sanctions put in place on Russia over the invasion. Energy exports have kept a steady stream of cash flowing to Russia despite otherwise severe restrictions on its financial sector.

The U.S. will be acting alone, but in close consultation with European allies, who are more dependent on Russian energy supplies. The European Union this week will commit to phasing out its reliance on Russia for energy needs as soon as possible, but filling the void without crippling EU economies will likely take some time. Natural gas from Russia accounts for one-third of Europe’s consumption of the fossil fuel. The U.S. does not import Russian natural gas.

Biden also issued a warning to private sector industries that the current circumstances should not be used as an excuse for “excessive price increases” and said as Russia’s aggression is already “costing us all ... it’s not the time for profiteering or price gouging.”

The issue of oil sanctions has created a conflict for the president between political interests at home and efforts to impose costs on Russia. Though Russian oil makes up only a small part of U.S. imports, Biden has said he was reluctant to ban it, cutting into supplies here and pushing gasoline prices higher.

In a Tweet before Biden spoke Tuesday morning, Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee said Biden needed to follow up the Russian import ban by expanding access to U.S. domestic energy resources.

“Now that @POTUS has finally consented to halting Russian oil imports, he must follow through with the logical second step and open the tap on America’s clean, abundant energy resources,” Lee tweeted.

Rep. John Curtis, R-Utah, called the ban of Russian oil a positive step but said the U.S. “must go even further.”

“It is time to choke Russia’s entire oil and gas industry and take steps to wean Europe off of its reliance on Russia,” he tweeted.

Banning Russian oil and #natgas from the U.S. is a positive step but we must go even further.

Even before the U.S. ban many Western energy companies including ExxonMobil and BP moved to cut ties with Russia and limit imports. Shell, which purchased a shipment of Russian oil this weekend, apologized for the move on Tuesday amid international criticism and pledged to halt further purchases of Russian energy supplies. Preliminary data from the U.S. Energy Department shows imports of Russian crude dropped to zero in the last week in February.

Inflation is at a 40-year peak, fueled in large part by gas prices, and that could hurt Biden heading into the November midterm elections. He said two weeks ago that he wanted “to limit the pain the American people are feeling at the gas pump.”

U.S. consumers have been feeling plenty of cost-related pain of late and the national average prices for a broad range of goods and services have been on the rise for a month.

Apartment rental costs rose 0.5% in January, the fastest pace in 20 years. Electricity prices surged 4.2% in January alone, the sharpest rise in 15 years, and are up 10.7% from a year earlier. Last month, household furniture and supplies rose 1.6%, the largest one-month increase on record dating to 1967.

Food costs, driven by pricier eggs, cereal and dairy products, increased 0.9% in January. Air fares rose 2.3%. New car prices, which have jumped during the pandemic because of a shortage of computer chips, were unchanged last month but are up 12.2% from a year ago. The surge in new car prices has, in turn, accelerated used car prices; they rose 1.5% in January and are up a dizzying 41% from a year ago.

The U.S. imported 245 million barrels of oil from Russia last year — about 8% of all U.S. oil imports — up from 198 million barrels in 2020. That’s less than the U.S. gets from Canada or Mexico but more than it imported last year from Saudi Arabia.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Striking harder at Russia’s economy, President Joe Biden on Tuesday ordered a ban on Russian oil imports in retaliation for Vladimir Putin’s onslaught in Ukraine. The major trade action, responding to the pleas of Ukraine’s embattled leader, thrust the U.S. out front as Western nations seek to halt Putin’s invasion.

Americans will feel pain, too — at the gas pump — Biden acknowledged, declaring, “Defending freedom is going to cost.”

The imports have been a glaring omission in the massive sanctions put in place on Russia over the invasion. Energy exports have kept a steady stream of cash flowing to Russia despite otherwise severe restrictions on its financial sector.

“We will not be part of subsidizing Putin’s war,” Biden said, calling the new action a “powerful blow” against Russia's ability to fund the ongoing offensive.

Biden said the U.S. was acting in close consultation with European allies, who are more dependent on Russian energy supplies and who he acknowledged may not be able to join in immediately. The announcement marked the latest Biden attempt at cutting off Russia from much of the global economy and ensuring that the Ukraine invasion is a strategic loss for Putin, even if he manages to seize territory.

“Ukraine will never be a victory for Putin,” Biden said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a tweet praised Biden's action: ""Thankful for US and @POTUS personal leadership in striking in the heart of Putin’s war machine and banning oil, gas and coal from US market. Encourage other countries and leaders to follow.”

The European Union this week will commit to phasing out its reliance on Russia for energy needs as soon as possible, but filling the void without crippling EU economies will likely take some time. The U.K., which is no longer part of the EU, announced Tuesday that oil and oil products from Russia will be phased out by the end of the year.

Unlike the U.S., which is a major oil and gas producer, Europe relies on imports for 90% of its gas and 97% of its oil products. Russia supplies 40% of Europe’s gas and a quarter of its oil. The U.S. does not import Russian natural gas.

The issue of oil sanctions has created a conflict for the president between political interests at home and efforts to impose costs on Russia. Though Russian oil makes up only a small part of U.S. imports, Biden has said he was reluctant to ban it, cutting into supplies here and pushing gasoline prices higher.

Inflation is at a 40-year peak, fueled in large part by gas prices, and that could hurt Biden heading into the November midterm elections.

“Putin’s war is already hurting American families at the gas pump,” Biden said, adding, “I’m going to do everything I can to minimize Putin’s price hike here at home.”

Gas prices have been rising for weeks due to the conflict and in anticipation of potential sanctions on the Russian energy sector. The average price for a gallon of gasoline in the U.S. hit a record $4.17 Tuesday, rising by 10 cents in one day, and up 55 cents since last week, according to auto club AAA.

Biden said it was understandable that prices were rising, but cautioned the U.S. energy industry against “excessive price increases” and exploiting consumers.

Even before the U.S. ban many Western energy companies including ExxonMobil and BP moved to cut ties with the Russia and limit imports. Shell, which purchased a shipment of Russian oil this weekend, apologized for the move on Tuesday amid international criticism and pledged to halt further purchases of Russian energy supplies. Preliminary data from the U.S. Energy Department shows imports of Russian crude dropped to zero in the last week in February.

In 2021, the U.S. imported roughly 245 million barrels of crude oil and petroleum products from Russia — a one-year increase of 24%, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

“It’s an important step to show Russia that energy is on the table,” said Max Bergmann, a former State Department official who is now a senior fellow at the Democratic-leaning Center for American Progress.

Bergmann said it wasn’t surprising that the U.S. was able to take this step before European nations, which are more dependent on Russian energy.

“All of this is being done in coordination, even if the steps are not symmetrical,” he said. “We are talking to them constantly.”

The White House said the ban on new purchases was effective immediately but the administration was allowing a 45-day “wind down” for continued delivery under existing contracts.

The news of Biden's decision Tuesday was first reported by Bloomberg.

The White House announcement comes amid bipartisan pressure on Capitol Hill to ban Russian energy and impose other economic costs.

Last week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gave a big boost when she declared, “Ban it.""

On Monday, Democrats on the powerful Ways & Means Committee posted, then removed, an announcement on a bipartisan bill to ban Russian oil imports and slap further trade sanctions on the country, according to an aide, because of pushback from the White House against acting before Biden had made his decision.

“President Biden is finally doing what members of Congress have been pushing for all along,” Sen John Barrasso, R-Wyo., and a member of party leadership, said Tuesday. “His decision to ban Russian oil is a much-needed step to kill Putin’s cash cow.""

Said Jason Furman, a Harvard professor and former economic adviser to President Barack Obama: “The United States economy can fully handle any of the challenges associated with higher oil prices. But it will bring some challenges. We’re going to have higher prices at the pump, and there’s no way around that.”

Pelosi said the House would go forward with a vote Tuesday on legislation to ban the Russian oil imports, impose trade costs on Russia and expand sanctions authority against Russians for attacks on civilians in Ukraine.

But late Tuesday, the House pushed back a vote on the bill amid disagreements among lawmakers over details. The House was expected to vote on the bill Wednesday, according to an aide granted anonymity to discuss the situation.

Before the invasion, Russian oil and gas made up more than a third of government revenues. Global energy prices have surged after the invasion and have continued to rise despite coordinated releases of strategic reserves, making Russian exports even more lucrative.

As a consequence of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. and international partners have sanctioned Russia’s largest banks, its central bank and finance ministry, and moved to block certain financial institutions from the SWIFT messaging system for international payments.

But the rules issued by the Treasury Department allow Russian energy transactions to keep going through non-sanctioned banks that are not based in the U.S. in an effort to minimize any disruptions to the global energy markets.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said he opposes a European ban on Russian energy imports and that there’s no other way to meet the European Union’s needs for motor fuel, heat and electricity, and industrial use. Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck said Tuesday that when he visited Washington last week, U.S. officials acknowledged Europe was in a different situation.

“They told me in the talks that they will neither demand nor ask that Germany do the same. But I would extrapolate from that for us, and for me, that we need as soon as possible to create the possibility to take similar measures.”

While Russian oil makes up a small amount of overall U.S. energy imports, the U.S. could replace Russian crude with imports from other oil-rich nations, but that could prove politically problematic.

Key U.S. senators are warning the Biden administration from seeking any oil import deal from the Nicolas Maduro regime in Venezuela.

“The Biden administration’s efforts to unify the entire world against a murderous tyrant in Moscow should not be undercut by propping up a dictator under investigation for crimes against humanity in Caracas,” said Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, in a statement late Monday. “The democratic aspirations of the Venezuelan people, much like the resolve and courage of the people of Ukraine, are worth much more than a few thousand barrels of oil.”
