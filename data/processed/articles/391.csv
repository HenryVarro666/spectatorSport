Zaporizhzhia (Ukraine) (AFP) – Dozens of buses tightly packed with exhausted evacuees from Mariupol and other Russian-occupied cities in southeast Ukraine arrived in Zaporizhzhia Friday to the relief of waiting relatives, according to an AFP reporter on the scene.

The passengers included people who managed to flee besieged Mariupol, as well as residents of Berdiansk and nearby Melitopol.

As the coaches pulled into a shopping centre on the outskirts of Zaporizhzhia more than 200 kilometres (120 miles) northwest, some evacuees wept with relief to be back in Ukrainian-controlled territory.

""We were crying when we reached this area. We were crying when we saw soldiers at the checkpoint with Ukrainian crests on their arms,"" said Olena, who carried her young daughter in her arms.

""My house was destroyed. I saw it in photos. Our city doesn't exist anymore.""

Mariupol has suffered near-total destruction since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, leaving residents without food, water and heat as they endured heavy bombardment.

On Friday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said its rescue convoy had been forced to turn back after it became ""impossible to proceed"". It said it would try another evacuation attempt Saturday.

An estimated 160,000 people are believed to still be trapped in the southeastern port city after several evacuation attempts collapsed, though some have made the dangerous dash to freedom alone.

In a video address posted on Telegram, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk confirmed Friday that 42 buses from Berdiansk had successfully brought people to safety, including Mariupol residents. Another 771 Mariupol residents had found their own transportation to Zaporizhzhia, she added.

""Know and believe: we are with you,"" Vereshchuk said.

Later, President Volodymyr Zelensky said they had ""managed to rescue 6,266 people, including 3,071 people from Mariupol"", though it was not immediately clear if he was talking about the people on the buses.

Tears of joy

Several evacuees from Mariupol told AFP they had to walk 15 kilometres or more to escape the city, before locating private vehicles to continue their journey.

Once they reached Russian-occupied Berdiansk, some were stranded for a further two weeks after several unsuccessful attempts to leave.

Their journey ended with a 12-hour bus ride that snaked its way through a series of checkpoints before arriving in Zaporizhzhia, a trip that would have taken just three hours before the war.

With no bathrooms onboard, some people had wet themselves, while other passengers were in desperate need of medication, such as insulin.

After the convoy arrived, an elderly woman from Mariupol grasped at the sky as she was transferred to a stretcher and rushed to hospital. Doctors said she had suffered a stroke.

Waiting outside during the post-curfew blackout, Ludmilla wept tears of joy when she spotted her mother's face through the window of one of the first buses to arrive.

""Three days ago my mother walked out of Mariupol and then found a car to take her to Berdiansk. I can't tell you how I feel to see her here,"" said Ludmilla, who left Mariupol on March 12 with husband Nikita.

Olga also anxiously waited to find family members on the buses.

""There are no words for how happy I am to see she is safe.""

""Her mother's family are still in Mariupol and we don't know if they are alive,"" she added.

Convoy of evacuee buses reaches Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine confirms

A column of buses carrying displaced people, including residents of the besieged port city of Mariupol, in southeastern Ukraine, arrived in Ukrainian-controlled Zaporizhzhia on Friday evening, AFP reports.

The buses were carrying residents of Mariupol who had managed to reach the city of Berdyansk, occupied by Russian forces, where they had been picked up by the convoy, those who arrived told AFP and officials.

The information was confirmed by Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk, in a video on Telegram.

""As of today, as we are recording this video, the buses are already on their way, bringing residents of Mariupol, 42 buses, to safety,"" she said.

AFP was able to observe about 30 buses.

“We know how much you hope to be saved. Every day we will try and try again to get through until you have a chance to leave the city, and most importantly, to live peacefully,” Vereshchouk added.

She said on Thursday that the Ukrainian government was sending 45 buses to evacuate civilians from Mariupol after Moscow announced a truce to allow them to leave.

The ICRC, which was to take part in the evacuation, announced on Friday that its team sent to Mariupol had to turn back, as the planned evacuation of thousands of civilians from the port city besieged by Russian forces was ""impossible"" on Friday.

The 42-strong convoy of buses organised by the Ukrainian government and escorted by the Red Cross headed from the nearby Russian-occupied city of Berdiansk to the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhzhia on Friday afternoon, according to the Mariupol city council’s channel on the messaging app Telegram.

Russian forces allowed the vehicles to pass, in what represented a small breakthrough after the failure of several previous evacuation attempts. Those onboard the buses had made it out of Mariupol to Berdiansk on their own, after which they were allowed to leave Russian-controlled territory. A further 631 people managed to flee Mariupol in private cars on Thursday night, the Ukrainian government said.

Up to 170,000 residents remain hemmed in by Russian ground forces in the strategically important coastal city, which before war broke out last month was home to about 430,000 people.

The Kyiv authorities reiterated on Friday that no aid or evacuation convoys had been allowed to reach Mariupol itself, despite reassurances from Russia on a limited ceasefire in the area, and it remained dangerous for the city’s residents to try to leave without assistance. Russian forces also seized 14 tons of food and medical supplies headed for Mariupol, the deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said.

“We don’t see a real desire from the Russians … to provide an opportunity for Mariupol residents to evacuate to territory controlled by Ukraine,” Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the mayor of the city, wrote on Telegram.

Mariupol has borne some of the worst violence of the conflict so far. Incessant airstrikes and shelling have hit civilian infrastructure, including a maternity hospital, aid warehouse and arts centre sheltering displaced people.

At least 5,000 people had died in the brutal assault, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Thursday, while electricity, water, food, fuel and medicine are running out. Ukraine has also accused Russian forces of shelling supposedly safe routes out of fighting hotspots, which Moscow denies. Mariupol city council said on Friday that Russia’s actions in the bombed-out city amounted to genocide.

On Thursday, Kyiv and Moscow agreed a humanitarian corridor along the route from Mariupol to Berdiansk and then Zaporizhzhia for several hours at 10am (8am BST) on Friday, but other than the the successful evacuation of the 2,000 people who had already made it to Berdiansk, by late afternoon little progress had been made.

A bus convoy had not been able to approach the dividing line into Mariupol, the International Committee for the Red Cross spokesperson Ewan Watson told reporters in Geneva, with complex logistics and instructions still being worked out and conveyed to military units on both sides. It was not immediately clear whether the convoy to which he was referring was the same one that transported people from Berdiansk.

Earlier in the week, the Kremlin said its goals in its “special operation” in Ukraine had shifted to gaining complete control of the Donbas, where Mariupol is located and where Moscow-backed separatists declared two independent republics in 2014.

Russian air and ground-launched missile attacks on Chernihiv, in northern Ukraine, and suburbs of the capital, Kyiv, have continued despite Moscow’s announced drawdown. Ukrainian forces said they had retaken the villages of Sloboda and Lukashivka, south of Chernihiv, on the main supply route to Kyiv, as well as carrying out limited counterattacks to the east and north-east of the capital.

Peace talks aimed at ending the five-week-old war, which has killed thousands and forced 4 million Ukrainians to flee the country, resumed by video link on Friday. Significant progress did not seem likely, however, following the stalled Mariupol evacuation attempt and Russian accusations of a Ukrainian helicopter attack earlier in the day. The alleged gunship assault on an an oil depot on the Russian side of the border, in Belgorod, is the first such reported incursion of its airspace by Ukrainian forces.

“Certainly, this is not something that can be perceived as creating comfortable conditions for the continuation of the talks,” the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said.

The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said he could “neither confirm nor reject the claim that Ukraine was involved in this, simply because I do not possess all the military information”.

Negotiations in Turkey earlier this week centred on Ukraine’s willingness to abandon its bid to join Nato.

5,b684222f-cf91-4a16-a50a-59bbb8a7a213,[],,"Ukraine on Saturday said Russian forces were making a “rapid retreat” from northern areas around the capital Kyiv and the city of Chernihiv as the Red Cross prepared for a fresh evacuation effort from the besieged southern port of Mariupol.

Ukraine said Russian forces were concentrating in the east and south, a day after thousands of people from Mariupol and surrounding Russian-held areas escaped in a convoy of buses and private cars.

“Russia is prioritizing a different tactic: falling back on the east and south,” Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak said on social media.

He said that while Russian forces appeared to be pulling back from Kyiv and Chernihiv, their aim was to “control a vast stretch of occupied territory and set up there in a powerful way.”

Podolyak said Russian forces would “dig in there, set up air defense, drastically reduce losses and dictate terms.

Moscow’s aim was to “drastically reduce losses & dictate terms,” he said on Twitter on Saturday.

“Without heavy weapons we won’t be able to drive (Russia) out.”

‘Our city doesn’t exist anymore’

Mariupol has been an important Ukrainian hold-out, suffering weeks of Russian shelling, with at least 5,000 residents killed, local officials said.

The estimated 160,000 who remain face shortages of food, water and electricity.

“We have managed to rescue 6,266 people, including 3,071 people from Mariupol,” Zelensky said in a video address earlier on Saturday.

Dozens of buses carrying Mariupol residents who had escaped the devastated city arrived Friday in Zaporizhzhia, 200 kilometers (120 miles) to the northwest, according to an AFP reporter on the scene.

The buses carried people who had been able to flee Mariupol to Russian-occupied Berdiansk.

“We were crying when we reached this area. We were crying when we saw soldiers at the checkpoint with Ukrainian crests on their arms,” said Olena, who carried her young daughter in her arms.

“My house was destroyed. I saw it in photos. Our city doesn’t exist anymore.”

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said its team headed to Mariupol to try and conduct an evacuation was forced to turn back Friday after “arrangements and conditions made it impossible to proceed.”

The ICRC said it would try again on Saturday.

Mykolaiv toll rises

At least 33 people were killed and 34 injured in a Russian rocket strike on the regional government building in the southern Ukrainian port city of Mykolaiv. Ukrainian officials gave the latest death toll in a statement Saturday, updating the numbers of the deadly strike that hit Mykolaiv on Tuesday.

Rescuers sent by the State Emergency Service have been searching the wreckage for survivors since Russian forces struck the building, which housed the office of regional governor Vitaliy Kim. The governor, who was not on the premises at the time of the attack, later posted social media images showing a gaping hole in the nine-story structure.

The confirmed death toll has risen steadily as the search and rescue operation continues.

Mykolaiv, a strategically important city en route to Ukraine’s largest port of Odesa, has withstood weeks of shelling by the Russian forces.

Brovary recaptured

Ukrainian officials said their forces have recaptured the city of Brovary, 20 kilometers (12 miles) east of the capital Kyiv.

Brovary’s mayor said during a televised address on Friday evening that “Russian occupants have now left practically all of the Brovary district.” He added that the Ukrainian forces would begin working to clear the region of remaining Russian soldiers there as well as “military hardware, and possibly from mines.”

The mayor said that many Brovary residents had already returned to the city, and that shops and businesses were reopening.

Earlier on Friday, Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said that satellite towns northwest of Kyiv were being targeted after Ukrainian fighters pushed back Russian troops, and that fighting had also taken place in Brovary.

New US aid

Peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow resumed via video on Friday, but the Kremlin warned that what it described as a helicopter attack on a fuel depot inside Russia would hamper negotiations.

“This is not something that can be perceived as creating comfortable conditions for the continuation of negotiations,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.

The airstrike hit energy giant Rosneft’s fuel storage facility in Belgorod, 40 kilometers from the Ukraine border.

But Kyiv would not be drawn on whether it was behind the attack, with Zelensky telling US network Fox News: “I’m sorry, I do not discuss any of my orders as commander in chief.”

He said Russia was consolidating and preparing “powerful strikes” in the east and south, joining Western assessments that Moscow’s troops were regrouping, not withdrawing.

Ukraine also warned that Russian forces who left the Chernobyl nuclear plant — site of the world’s worst nuclear accident, in 1986 — after weeks of occupation may have been exposed to radiation.

“Russia behaved irresponsibly in Chernobyl” by digging trenches in contaminated areas and keeping plant personnel from performing their duties, said Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba.

Zelensky meanwhile repeated his plea for the West to provide greater military support.

“Just give us missiles. Give us airplanes,” he told Fox. “You cannot give us F-18 or F-19 or whatever you have? Give us the old Soviet planes. That’s all… Give me something to defend my country with.”

The Pentagon later said it was allotting $300 million in “security assistance” to bolster Ukraine’s defense capabilities, adding to the $1.6 billion Washington has committed since Russia invaded in late February.

‘Where roses used to bloom’

A ferocious Ukrainian fightback and Russia’s logistics and tactical problems have hampered Russian efforts and there is growing concern inside the country as military losses mount.

Russia on Friday launched its annual military draft but vowed that conscripts would not be sent to fight in Ukraine.

Referring to the draft, Zelensky urged Russian families not to send their children to war.

“Don’t let them join the army. It’s not their war. We don’t need any more deaths,” he said.

Civilians have trickled out of devastated areas after arduous and daring escapes.

Three-year-old Karolina Tkachenko and her family walked an hour through a field strewn with burnt-out Russian armored vehicles to flee their village outside Kyiv.

“The shops are closed, there’s no delivery of supplies. The bridge is also blown up, we can’t go for groceries through there,” said Karolina’s mother Karina Tkachenko.

In Mariupol, Viktoria Dubovytskaya, who had sheltered in the theatre where 300 people are feared to have been killed in Russian bombardments, said she only grasped the extent of the destruction as she fled.

Bodies lay in the rubble and small wooden crosses were planted in the ground, she told AFP.

“When people find their loved ones, they just bury them wherever they can. Sometimes where roses used to bloom,” she said.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/red-cross-tries-to-reach-besieged-mariupol-as-russia-retreats-from-northern-ukraine/

Russian troops are “slowly but noticeably” moving out of the north of Ukraine, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address on Friday.

“The occupiers are withdrawing forces in the north of our country. The withdrawal is slow but noticeable. Somewhere they are expelled with battles. Somewhere they leave positions on their own,” Zelensky said.

Zelensky also urged Ukrainians to remain cautious in the north as troops withdraw.

“We are moving forward. Moving carefully. And everyone who returns to this area must also be very careful. It is still impossible to return to normal life as it was. Even in the areas we return after the fighting. You will have to wait. Wait for our land to be cleared. Wait until you can be assured that new shelling is impossible,” he said.

In eastern Ukraine, Zelensky said preparations are underway for more Russian strikes in the Donbas region and the country's second-largest city, Kharkiv.

“In the east of our country, the situation remains extremely difficult. The Russian militaries are being accumulated in Donbas, in the Kharkiv direction. They are preparing for new powerful blows. We are preparing for even more active defense,” Zelensky said.

""Humanitarian catastrophe"": Zelensky added that 6,266 people were rescued through evacuation corridors in Donetsk, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia on Friday.
