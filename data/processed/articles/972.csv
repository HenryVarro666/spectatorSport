0,cb097662-f327-442e-b4a1-8a1aa5799394,[],,"A Russian newspaper has accused hackers of planting fake news on its website after a report briefly appeared there saying nearly 10,000 Russian soldiers had been killed in Ukraine.

The incident marked the second apparent breach within a week of the tightly controlled war narrative that the Kremlin promotes through loyal Russian media.

An online article on the site of mass-market paper Komsomolskaya Pravda, still accessible via a web archive tool, quotes the Russian defense ministry as saying 9,861 Russian servicemen have been killed and 16,153 wounded in what Moscow calls its special military operation in Ukraine.

Those figures had been removed from a version of the same article visible on the website on Tuesday. Instead, an advisory said: ""On March 21, access to the administrator interface was hacked on the Komsomolskaya Pravda website and a fake insert was made in this publication about the situation around the special operation in Ukraine. The inaccurate information was immediately removed.

""Russia has not officially updated its casualty figures since stating on March 2 that 498 servicemen had been killed and 1,597 wounded. Since then its offensive has run into further heavy resistance from Ukraine's army and volunteer defense forces.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call on Tuesday that he could not comment on the incident with Komsomolskaya Pravda, saying it was a question for the newspaper.

He said he had no information on casualty figures. Alexander Gamov, a Kremlin correspondent for the paper, said on the same call that its website had been hacked and fake information had appeared there for several minutes. Earlier, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak drew attention to the two online versions of the newspaper article and the alleged figure of 9,861 Russian deaths.

""This is only the beginning of the realization of their national catastrophe. Because in the real world there are almost twice as many as Russians killed,"" Podolyak wrote on Telegram.

It was not possible to independently verify any of the purported casualty claims.Komsomsolskya Pravda is among Russian media which have loyally followed President Vladimir Putin's line that Moscow is pursuing a special operation in Ukraine to demilitarize and ""denazify"" the country—an argument rejected by Ukraine and the West as a false pretext to invade a democratic country.",https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/.premium.LIVE-russia-targeting-critical-infrastucture-ukraine-says-as-biden-takes-harsher-tone-1.10689703

05:49 am: Vietnam Airlines to suspend regular flights to Russia from March 25

02:25 am: Leading Belarus opposition figure calls for tougher sanctions against Lukashenko

Leading exiled Belarusian opposition figure Pavel Latushko on Wednesday urged the West to strengthen sanctions against President Alexander Lukashenko and his regime for supporting Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Lukashenko has backed President Vladimir Putin’s war, allowing him to launch attacks from Belarusian territory and prompting critics to brand him a “partner-in-crime” and “co-aggressor”.

Although he has faced tightening sanctions since violently cracking down on mass protests in Belarus following elections in 2020 widely condemned as rigged, critics argue Western nations could and should go further.

“Lukashenko deserves far more global opprobrium than has come his way,” Latushko wrote in The New European newspaper. “He may be Putin’s pawn. But he is also a major player in this horror show, and it is time the West realised it, and acted accordingly. Both of these monsters need to be held to account.”

01:53 am: Signs of Ukrainian forces going on offensive, reclaiming territory, Pentagon says

Ukrainian forces have reversed the battlefield momentum against invading Russians in some areas to reclaim ground in recent days, the Pentagon said Tuesday.

The Ukrainians are “in places and at times going on an offensive"", particularly in the south of the country, US Defense Department spokesman John Kirby told CNN.

“They are going after Russians and pushing them out of places where the Russians have been in the past,” he said, particularly in Mykolaiv. “We have seen this now increase over the last few days.”

Kirby said he could not confirm reports from Ukrainian officials that they had retaken at least one town and expect to take more in coming days. But it would be “consistent with the kind of fighting and the kinds of capabilities we have seen the Ukrainians use”, he said.

As for the Russians, he echoed Western analysts who have said the invading forces have become bogged down.

“They are running out of fuel. They’re running out of food. They are not integrating their operations in a joint manner the way you would think a modern military would,” Kirby said.

The office is located in the city’s Metro shopping centre, the council said in a Telegram post.

Switzerland adopts more EU sanctions against Russia

Switzerland’s government says it has adopted more EU sanctions against Russia after pledging to act in step with the bloc as it moves to financially punish Moscow.

“This means that all measures contained in the EU’s fourth package of sanctions have been implemented,” the country’s cabinet said in a statement.

However, the cabinet said it had decided not to implement the EU measure of March 1 suspending the broadcasting of Russian media outlets Sputnik and Russia Today.

“Despite the fact that these outlets are used to spread targeted propaganda and disinformation by the Russian Federation, the Federal Council is of the opinion that it is more effective to counter untrue and harmful statements with facts instead of preventing them from being broadcast,” it added.

Dozens of Ukrainian officials, journalists detained, disappeared: UN

Dozens of Ukrainian officials, journalists and activists have been detained or forcibly disappeared by invading Russian forces, the UN has warned, saying that some cases resembled “hostage-taking”.

The UN’s human rights office (OHCHR) said it had documented the arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance of 22 local Ukrainian officials, 13 of whom had subsequently been released, since Moscow launched its attack.

At least 15 journalists and civil society activists “who vocally opposed the invasion” in several regions had also been taken, Matilda Bogner, OHCHR’s representative in Ukraine, said in a statement.

“This does seem to be a pattern that is occurring in areas that are occupied by the Russian Federation,” she said.

“Forces of the Russian Federation are going specifically to detain, and do not inform relatives and others where they are taking people … That does in some cases appear to be a form of hostage-taking.”

Moscow updates troop death toll, says 1,351 killed

Russia’s army has updated its troop death toll, saying 1,351 soldiers have been killed and 3,825 others wounded since the start of its offensive in Ukraine.

The new toll, announced at a Moscow briefing delivered by senior military officials, came several weeks after Moscow gave its first assessment of losses in the conflict on March 2.

At the time, Russia put the number of its forces killed at 498.

Kyiv says more than 16,000 Russian troops have been killed, while NATO officials have told Al Jazeera they believe the death toll on the Russian side amounts to between 7,000-15,000 personnel.

Russia says first phase of Ukraine ‘operation’ mostly complete

Russia has said the first phase of its “military operation” in Ukraine is mostly complete and that it will now focus on completely “liberating” eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region.

The Russian defence ministry said Russian-backed separatists now controlled 93 percent of Ukraine’s Luhansk region and 54 percent of the Donetsk region – the two areas that jointly make up the Donbas.

“The combat potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has been considerably reduced, which … makes it possible to focus our core efforts on achieving the main goal, the liberation of Donbas,” Sergei Rudskoi, head of the Russian General Staff’s Main Operational Directorate, said.

The defence ministry added that it did not rule out storming Ukrainian cities that had been blockaded and said that Russia would react immediately to any attempt to close the airspace over Ukraine – something Kyiv has asked NATO to do, but NATO has resisted.

It said that Moscow’s offensive would continue until Russian forces had completed the tasks that had been set by Russian President Vladimir Putin, without saying what those tasks were.

Russia’s military had considered two options for its operation in Ukraine, one confined to the Donbas and the other on the whole territory of Ukraine, before opting for the latter, according to Rudskoi.

EU pens new deal with US aimed at reducing reliance on Russian gas

The US and EU have announced a new deal on liquefied natural gas (LNG) aimed at reducing Europe’s reliance on Russian energy imports.

The agreement, unveiled by Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at a news conference in Brussels, will see the US supply the bloc with at least 15 billion additional cubic metres of the fuel this year.

“This will replace the LNG supply we currently receive from Russia,” von der Leyen said.

She added the EU will work with member states to also ensure they can receive at least 50 bcm of additional LNG until 2030.

About 10 percent of the EU’s gas needs are met by production within the bloc. Russia typically supplies about 41 percent of the rest of the LNG used by its member states.

“Others were either shot down by air defence forces, or hit wrong targets – mountains, forests, rivers,” it added. “They have imprecise missiles and crooked hands.”

Ukraine forces striking ‘high value’ Russian targets: UK

The UK’s defence ministry says Ukrainian forces have launched raids against “high-value targets in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, including a landing ship and ammunition storage depots at Berdyansk”.

In its latest intelligence update, the ministry said such attacks will force the Russian military to “prioritise the defence of their supply chain and deprive them of much-needed resupply for forces”.

“This will reduce Russia’s ability to conduct offensive operations and further damage already dwindling morale,” it added.

Ukraine says Moscow forcibly taking civilians to Russia

Ukraine says Moscow has forcibly taken 402,000 civilians from shattered Ukrainian cities to Russia, where some may be used as “hostages” to pressure Kyiv to give up.

Lyudmyla Denisova, Ukraine’s ombudsperson, said the figure included 84,000 children.

She said they were being held in primitive conditions with little food and water.

The Kremlin gave nearly identical numbers for those who have been relocated but said they wanted to go to Russia.

Ukraine’s rebel-controlled eastern regions are predominantly Russian-speaking, and many people there have supported close ties to Moscow.

US Senate delays vote to revoke ‘most-favoured-nation’ trade status for Russia

Legislation removing “most-favoured-nation” trade status for Russia has been delayed in the US Senate at least until next week, after some Republicans raised concerns that its human rights provisions might be too broad.

The bill was blocked despite legislators’ insistence that they wanted to show a united front in supporting the government in Kyiv, a month after Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine.

It is expected to pass next week, although the delay stymied efforts by Biden’s fellow Democrats to pass it in time for his meetings on Thursday with allies in Europe.

7,cb097662-f327-442e-b4a1-8a1aa5799394,[],,"Since launching his unprovoked and unjust war of choice, Russian President Vladimir Putin has unleashed unrelenting violence that has caused death and destruction across Ukraine. We’ve seen numerous credible reports of indiscriminate attacks and attacks deliberately targeting civilians, as well as other atrocities. Russia’s forces have destroyed apartment buildings, schools, hospitals, critical infrastructure, civilian vehicles, shopping centers, and ambulances, leaving thousands of innocent civilians killed or wounded. Many of the sites Russia’s forces have hit have been clearly identifiable as in-use by civilians. This includes the Mariupol maternity hospital, as the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights expressly noted in a March 11 report. It also includes a strike that hit a Mariupol theater, clearly marked with the word “дети” — Russian for “children” — in huge letters visible from the sky. Putin’s forces used these same tactics in Grozny, Chechnya, and Aleppo, Syria, where they intensified their bombardment of cities to break the will of the people. Their attempt to do so in Ukraine has again shocked the world and, as President Zelenskyy has soberly attested, “bathed the people of Ukraine in blood and tears.”

Every day that Russia’s forces continue their brutal attacks, the number of innocent civilians killed and wounded, including women and children, climbs. As of March 22, officials in besieged Mariupol said that more than 2,400 civilians had been killed in that city alone. Not including the Mariupol devastation, the United Nations has officially confirmed more than 2,500 civilian casualties, including dead and wounded, and emphasizes the actual toll is likely higher.

Last week, I echoed President Biden’s statement, based on the countless accounts and images of destruction and suffering we have all seen, that war crimes had been committed by Putin’s forces in Ukraine. I noted then that the deliberate targeting of civilians is a war crime. I emphasized that Department of State and other U.S. government experts were documenting and assessing potential war crimes in Ukraine.

Today, I can announce that, based on information currently available, the U.S. government assesses that members of Russia’s forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine.

Our assessment is based on a careful review of available information from public and intelligence sources. As with any alleged crime, a court of law with jurisdiction over the crime is ultimately responsible for determining criminal guilt in specific cases. The U.S. government will continue to track reports of war crimes and will share information we gather with allies, partners, and international institutions and organizations, as appropriate. We are committed to pursuing accountability using every tool available, including criminal prosecutions.",https://www.state.gov/war-crimes-by-russias-forces-in-ukraine/
8,cb097662-f327-442e-b4a1-8a1aa5799394,[],2022-03-23,"Editor's note: This page recaps the news from Ukraine on Wednesday, March 23. Follow here for the latest updates and news from Thursday, March 24, as Russia's invasion continues.

As many as 15,000 Russian troops have been killed since the invasion of Ukraine began four weeks ago, according to NATO's first estimate.

Russia has suffered 30,000 to 40,000 battlefield casualties, including 7,000 to 15,000 killed, a senior NATO military officer said in a briefing Wednesday from the alliance’s military headquarters in Belgium.

Also Wednesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. has determined Russian military forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine.

The senior military officer, speaking on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by NATO, said the estimated deaths are based on information from the Ukrainian government, indications from Russia and open-source information. The officer said the number of fatalities came from a calculation of three wounded soldiers for every soldier killed. Casualties include killed, wounded or missing in action as well as those taken prisoner.

Earlier this week, a senior Pentagon official estimated the Russian military had lost more than 10% of the combat force in Ukraine.

Russia is beginning to dig into defensive positions outside Kyiv in the face of fierce Ukrainian opposition, a senior Defense official said. The Russian advance from the north remains stalled about 10 miles from the city center, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence assessments. To the east of Kyiv, the Ukrainians have pushed back the front line about 15 miles to 30 miles outside the city.

The Russians appear to be attacking more aggressively in eastern Ukraine, the official said. Fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists has been ongoing in the region since 2014.

The Ukraine Defense Ministry claims its forces have driven occupying Russian troops out of Makariv – a small Kyiv suburb that's crucial because it provides control of a highway to the west. The effort also blocked Russian troops from surrounding Kyiv from the northwest and provided the Ukrainian military with a much-needed success story.

Blinken: US has determined Russia committed war crimes

Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday the United States has determined Russian forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine.

“Today, I can announce that, based on information currently available, the U.S. government assesses that members of Russia's forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine,” Blinken said in a statement.

He said the assessment is based on “a careful review of available information from public and intelligence sources.”

Blinken said Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion has unleashed “unrelenting violence that has caused death and destruction across Ukraine.” He cited reports of indiscriminate attacks, including those deliberately targeting civilians, among other atrocities.

“Russia’s forces have destroyed apartment buildings, schools, hospitals, critical infrastructure, civilian vehicles, shopping centers and ambulances, leaving thousands of innocent civilians killed or wounded,” Blinken said, pointing to the attack on a maternity hospital in Mariupol, among other incidents.

“As with any alleged crime, a court of law with jurisdiction over the crime is ultimately responsible for determining criminal guilt in specific cases,” Blinken said. “The U.S. government will continue to track reports of war crimes and will share information we gather with allies, partners and international institutions and organizations, as appropriate.

Russia to expel more American diplomats, State Department says

Russia has begun the process to expel several American diplomats from the U.S. embassy in Moscow, the State Department said Wednesday.

The department said it received a list of diplomats on who have been declared “persona non grata” by the Russian foreign ministry. It didn’t say how many diplomats were affected by the order, which generally results in the expulsion of those targeted within 72 hours.

Abramovich escapes US sanctions because of possible role as peacemaker, WSJ reports

Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, owner of the Chelsea soccer club in the British Premier League, has been sanctioned by the U.K. and the European Union because of his close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

But so far Abramovich has avoided penalties from the United States, and the reason stems from a request made by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who sees Abramovich as a potential key figure in negotiating a peace deal, the Wall Street Journal reported.

The newspaper said Zelenskyy made the request to President Joe Biden shortly before the U.S. was about to impose sanctions on Abramovich, a former oil tycoon.

A spokesperson for Abramovich declined to offer details but said in a statement to the WSJ that, ""Based on requests, including from Jewish organizations in Ukraine, he has been doing all he can to support efforts aimed at restoring peace as soon as possible.''

NATO leaders to call out China for not condemning Russia’s invasion

NATO leaders will pressure China to condemn Russia’s invasion and not provide military support to its ally, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Wednesday.

“I expect leaders will call on China to live up to its responsibilities as a member of the U.N. Security Council,” Stoltenberg said at a news conference previewing Thursday’s emergency NATO meeting on Ukraine in Brussels, which President Joe Biden will attend.

Stoltenberg said Beijing has joined Moscow in questioning the right of independent nations to choose their own path. And he charged China with providing political support to Russia by “spreading blatant lies and disinformation” about the war.

“China has not been able to condemn the invasion,” he said.

Stoltenberg said China should do so now and “engage in diplomatic efforts to find a peaceful way to end this war as soon as possible.”

Treasury, legislators look into freezing Russia's gold

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and U.S. lawmakers are discussing the possibility of freezing Russia's gold reserves, estimated at a value of $130 billion, after legislators introduced a bill targeting Russia’s ability to sell its gold to avoid the impact of sanctions.

President Vladimir Putin has for years built Russia's stockpile of gold, which is not subject to the sanctions imposed by the West since the early stages of the Ukraine invasion.

“We cannot allow Putin to take advantage of a loophole that could help finance his unconscionable attack on Ukraine,” said Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire.

'People are being killed day and night,' refugee from Kharkiv says

The Russian assault on Kharkiv has left the northeastern city with Ukraine's second-largest population in a ""terrible'' situation. That's the assessment of Natalia Savchenko, 37, a Ukrainian who left the city and sought refuge in Medyka, Poland.

“People are being killed day and night,'' Savchenko said. ""They are shooting with everything they have. There is almost no one left in Kharkiv. There is no electricity, water. The city is almost empty. They do not supply children with medicine and food. They are just killing people.”

Savchenko said the military helped her escape by train.

“It is horrible, so horrible,” she said. “We left, but in the district where we lived, my grandmother stayed, my mom and my husband. Today our district was bombed, Shevchenkivsky district. We are running away.”

NATO to add 4 battlegroups

President Joe Biden and other NATO leaders meeting Thursday in Brussels will likely agree to strengthen the alliance's position on land, at sea and in the air, NATO's Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Wednesday.

Added to existing forces in the Baltics and Poland, NATO will have eight multinational NATO battlegroups along the eastern flank from the Baltic to the Black Sea, he said.

""We face a new reality for our security,"" Stoltenberg said. ""So we must reset our deterrence and defense for the longer term.""

Growing number of Ukrainian refugees returning home: 'Everything we have is there'

Amid the more than 3.5 million refugees who have left their homes in Ukraine for the safety of other countries because of the Russian invasion, a small but growing number are heading back.

Many plan to stay only briefly, to check on their homes or to collect clothing more suited for the coming spring weather. Others say they're tired of living in fear and are confident the Ukrainian military will ultimately prevail, thanks in part to the weapons, supplies and intelligence being provided by the United States and its allies.

International aid workers said the number of eastbound returnees to Ukraine is increasing daily, most of them women and children because men of fighting age had to stay behind to defend the country.

“Everything we have is there,"" said Karina Hoderan, an engineer who was heading home to Odesa with her family to pick up clothes and wasn't sure whether they would go back to Moldova for refuge. ""And we are too tired to be nervous.""

Ukraine says Russia seized relief workers in Mariupol convoy

Ukrainian leaders accused Russia of seizing 15 rescue workers and drivers from a humanitarian convoy of 11 buses that had been expected to evacuate residents.

“Employees of the state emergency service and bus drivers have been taken captive,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. “We are trying to organize stable humanitarian corridors for Mariupol residents, but almost all of our attempts, unfortunately, are foiled by the Russian occupiers, by shelling or deliberate terror.''

He estimated 100,000 civilians remained in Mariupol, once home to more than 400,000 people, after weeks of shelling that have battered the city.

“They bombed us for the past 20 days,” said Viktoria Totsen, 39, who fled into Poland. “During the last five days, the planes were flying over us every five seconds and dropped bombs everywhere – on residential buildings, kindergartens, art schools, everywhere.”

Ukrainian agency: Russian forces destroyed laboratory at Chernobyl

A laboratory at the Chernobyl nuclear plant that works to improve the management of radioactive waste was destroyed, according to the Ukrainian agency in charge of the area surrounding the plant.

The laboratory contained “highly active samples and samples of radionuclides that are now in the hands of the enemy, which we hope will harm itself and not the civilized world,” the agency said in its statement.

Ukraine’s nuclear regulatory agency also said Monday that radiation monitors around the plant had stopped working.

Russia seized control of the Chernobyl plant early in its invasion of Ukraine, along with the Zaporizhzhia plant. Chernobyl is the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986 when a reactor exploded. The exclusion zone is the contaminated area around the plant.

Putin won't rule out using nuclear weapons, spokesperson says

Russian President Vladimir Putin has not ruled out the possibility of using nuclear weapons in the nearly four-week-long war with Ukraine, his longtime spokesman said Tuesday in a CNN interview.

Asked by CNN’s chief international anchor, Christiane Amanpour, whether he's convinced Putin won't take that drastic step, press secretary Dmitry Peskov declined to dismiss that option.

""Well, we have a concept of domestic security, and, well, it's public,'' Peskov responded. ""You can read all the reasons for nuclear arms to be used. So, if it is an existential threat for our country, then it can be used, in accordance with our concept.''

It's not the first time a high-ranking Russian official has dangled a nuclear threat, likely to sow fear among adversaries. Three days after launching the Ukraine invasion Feb. 24, Putin ordered Russian nuclear forces put on high alert in response to tough sanctions from the West.
