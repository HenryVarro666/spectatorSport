06:14 am: Trump asks Putin to help dish dirt on Hunter Biden

Donald Trump has called on Russian President Vladimir Putin, who launched an invasion of Ukraine last month, to reveal any compromising information he might have on US President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter.

The former Republican president returned to accusations he had repeated many times during his unsuccessful campaign against Biden in the 2020 presidential election.

In an interview excerpt broadcast Tuesday by Real America’s Voice “Just the News” show, Trump claimed that the wife of the mayor of Moscow gave $3.5 million to Hunter Biden.

“That’s a lot of money,” he said. “She gave him $3.5 million so now I would think Putin would know the answer to that. I think he should release it.”

Trump has long claimed, without providing evidence, that the younger Biden received the funds from Elena Baturina, wife of the late Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov, in a bid to curry favor with Joe Biden.

04:55 am: US State Department warns that Moscow may ‘detain’ Americans in Russia

The US State Department issued a travel advisory on Tuesday warning that Moscow “may single out and detain US citizens in Russia” and repeating earlier warnings for Americans not to travel to the country.

The warning was “due to the unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine by Russian military forces” as well as the potential for harassment of US citizens by Russian authorities, the travel advisory said, repeating calls for Americans travelling or living in Russia to leave “immediately”.

03:57 am: Death toll in Mykolaiv strike rises to 12

At least 12 people were killed and 33 wounded on Tuesday when a Russian missile hit a regional government building in the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv, emergency officials said.

“The bodies of 12 people have been recovered from the site of the destruction and 33 people have been injured,” Ukraine’s emergencies agency said in a statement on Telegram.

Photos posted by the agency showed rescue workers clearing the rubble and a female medical worker in a red suit helping an injured man lying on a stretcher, his face bloodied.

Earlier in the day officials spoke of nine people being killed and 28 injured in the strike, which hit the nine-storey building shortly before 9 am local time, destroying the entire central part of the structure.

After a lull in the fighting that lasted several days, the attack on Tuesday morning surprised this city, which is home to half a million people in peacetime. Mykolaiv stands on the road to Odesa, Ukraine’s largest port in the south.

The front line in the region has recently shifted southeast to Mykolaiv, which is located near Kherson, the only major Ukrainian city that Russia claims to have taken under full control since the war started over a month ago.

03:06 am: With Ukraine farmers on frontlines, UN food chief warns of ‘devastation’

The UN food chief warned on Tuesday that the war in Ukraine was threatening to devastate the World Food Programme’s efforts to feed some 125 million people globally because Ukraine had gone “from the breadbasket of the world to breadlines.”

“It’s not just decimating dynamically Ukraine and the region, but it will have global context impact beyond anything we’ve seen since World War Two,” WFP Executive Director David Beasley told the 15-member United Nations Security Council.

Beasley said 50 percent of the grain bought by the WFP, the food-assistance branch of the United Nations, comes from Ukraine, “so you can only assume the devastation that this is going to have on our operations alone.”

“The farmers are on the frontlines,” he said.

Beasley added that the crisis was compounded by a lack of fertilizer products coming from Belarus and Russia.

“If you don’t put fertilizer on the crops, your yield will be at least 50% diminished. So we’re looking at what could be a catastrophe on top of a catastrophe in the months ahead,” he told the council.

02:48 am: Ukrainian military remains wary of Russian promises

The general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said Tuesday evening that Russia’s promise to curtail military operations in some areas was “probably a rotation of individual units and aims to mislead.”

01:14 am: Thousands of civilians may have died in Mariupol in past month, UN says

Thousands of civilians may have died in the besieged port city of Mariupol in southern Ukraine since bombing began four weeks ago, the head of the UN human rights mission told Reuters on Tuesday, providing its first estimate.

Nearly 5,000 people, including about 210 children, have been killed in Mariupol since Russian forces laid siege to it a month ago, a spokesperson for Mayor Vadym Boichenko said on Monday.

His office said 90% of Mariupol’s buildings had been damaged and 40% destroyed, including hospitals, schools, kindergartens and factories.

“We do think that there could be thousands of deaths, of civilian casualties, in Mariupol,” Matilda Bogner, head of the UN human rights mission in Ukraine which deploys some 60 monitors, said in a virtual interview.

She said the mission did not have a precise estimate but was working to gather more information.

Local officials, citing witness accounts, last week estimated that 300 people were killed in the March 16 bombing of a Mariupol theatre where people were sheltering.

As of Tuesday, the UN human rights office had confirmed 1,179 civilians killed and 1,860 injured across Ukraine in the five-week old conflict, amid reporting delays due to the hostilities, a statement said.

March 30, 00:36 am: Western diplomats accuse Russia of fuelling global food crisis

Western diplomats accused Russia before the UN Security Council on Tuesday of having caused a “global food crisis” and putting people at risk of “famine” by starting the war in Ukraine, which serves as a breadbasket for Europe.

Russian President Vladimir Putin “started this war. Vladimir Putin created this global food crisis. And he is the one who can stop it,” US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said during a Security Council meeting devoted to the humanitarian situation in Ukraine.

France’s ambassador to the UN, Nicolas de Riviere, furthered that “Russia’s aggression against Ukraine is increasing the risk of famine around the world” and that populations in developing countries would be the first to be affected.

“Russia will no doubt try to make us believe that it is the sanctions adopted against it that are creating an imbalance in the world security situation for food,” de Riviere added.

Moscow’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia indeed countered that potential turbulence in the global food market was in fact caused by “the unbridled sanctions hysteria that the West has unleashed against Russia.”

Sherman and the director of the World Food Program (WFP), David Beasley, reported that Ukraine and Russia, which are both major cereal producers, represent 30 percent of world wheat exports, 20 percent for corn and 75 percent for sunflower oil.

10:06 pm: Ukraine's Zelensky calls Russia talks 'positive' but wants to see results

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said there were ""positive"" signals from peace talks with Russia on Tuesday but that there could be no talk of lifting sanctions until the war ends.

Zelensky also expressed skepticism about Moscow's stated plan of a military de-escalation, saying: ""We will not decrease our defense efforts"". He added that there could be no talk of lifting Russia sanctions until the war ends.

9:25 pm: Russia 'repositioning' forces near Kyiv, not withdrawing, says Pentagon

Russia is ""repositioning"" a small number of its forces near Kyiv but is not withdrawing and the Ukrainian capital remains under threat, the Pentagon said Tuesday.

""We're seeing a small number now that appears to be moving away from Kyiv, this on the same day that the Russians say they're withdrawing,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said.

""But we're not prepared to call this a retreat or even a withdrawal,"" he said. ""We think that what they probably have in mind is a repositioning to prioritize elsewhere.""

""We all should be prepared to watch for a major offensive against other areas of Ukraine,"" Kirby said. ""It does not mean that the threat to Kyiv is over.

""Russia has failed in its objective of capturing Kiev,"" the Pentagon spokesman said, but ""they can still inflict massive brutality on the country including on Kyiv"".

The leaders of the United States, UK, France, Germany and Italy on Tuesday urged the West not to drop its guard against Russia after Moscow signalled it would scale down fighting around two Ukrainian cities.

The reduction in military activity would take place around the capital, Kyiv, and the city of Chernigiv, the Kremlin said.

US President Joe Biden on Tuesday said it remains to be seen whether Russia follows through with any actions to scale down its military operations in Ukraine, saying Washington and its allies will continue with strong sanctions and aid for Ukraine.

""We'll see if they follow through with what they're suggesting"" as Moscow-Kyiv negotiations continue, he told reporters at the White House following his meeting with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore.

""We're going to continue to keep a close eye on what's going on.""

No one should mistake that for Russia ending the conflict.”

5:12 pm: Russia has repeatedly fired hypersonic missiles at Ukraine targets, says US general

4:50 pm: Ukraine's negotiation positions

Ukraine made a series of proposals at talks held Tuesday in Turkey with Russia on resolving the month-long conflict.

Here is a summary of the major proposals:

1) Security guarantees

Ukraine wants legally binding security guarantees from Western countries, which it says will be equivalent to or better than NATO's collective security guarantee.

""We want an international mechanism of security guarantees where guarantor countries will act in a similar way to NATO's article number five -- and even more firmly,"" David Arakhamia, a Ukrainian negotiator, told reporters after talks with the Russian delegation.

2) Neutrality not NATO

With such security guarantees Ukraine could become neutral, which in effect means it would drop its aspirations to join NATO.

""Ukraine would accept neutral status if the security guarantees work,"" said Arakhamia.

3) No foreign military bases

With foreign security guarantees in place, Ukraine ""won't host on its territory any foreign military base"", said Okesandr Chaly, another Ukrainian negotiator at the talks.

4) EU membership

Kyiv insisted that the international accord on the country's security not block Ukraine's possible membership in the EU.

5) Territorial integrity

Ukraine proposes to sidestep the question of Crimea and the breakaway territories in the eastern Donbas region.

In order for the security guarantees to quickly come into force the accord would ""temporarily exclude"" these areas, said Arakhamia.

“Today Ukraine is facing horrible humanitarian catastrophe. I feel sorry for Minister Shaked, who forgot that the Jewish people have been refugees for all of their lives. Unfortunately the lessons of history already forgotten. Let me remind you [of] the case of the St.Louis - a vessel boarded with Jews who were trying to escape the horrors of war in Europe and failed to find a safe harbor,” Yevgen Korniychuk said at the opening of a photography exhibition about the war.

The MS St. Louis was a passenger ship carrying hundreds of Jewish refugees which was turned back by various western countries, including Cuba and the United States, before returning its passengers to Europe in 1939.

“Today Ukrainians is facing artificial obstacles to enter Israel and escape horrors of war,” Korniychuk said, stating that he believed most Israelis agreed with him and calling on “the Israeli government to wake up and accompany the spirit of the Jewish people in their actions.”

Korniychuk’s comments came a day after the state informed Israel's High Court that it will continue to restrict the entry of Ukrainian refugees who are not eligible for immigration to Israel under the Law of Return and have no relatives in the country, despite the existence of a visa-free travel agreement between Jerusalem and Kyiv.

Israel's quota for Ukrainian refugees who are ineligible for Israeli citizenship and have no relatives in Israel is 5,000 – though the state said it would allow 20 additional refugees in this category to enter per day, even if the quota is exceeded.",https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/LIVE-ukraine-says-it-reseized-towns-near-kyiv-ahead-of-peace-talks-in-turkey-1.10705208

The resulting dialogue and expansion of bilateral relations––despite differences between Turkey and Russia in Syria, Libya, Nagorno-Karabakh, and apparently Ukraine––sowed further mistrust between Ankara and its Western partners.

Was it still a part of the West? Was it moving East? Was Turkey making a bid for leadership in the Middle East? The Eastern Mediterranean? The Muslim world? The answer to all of these questions is yes.

Erdogan has always been as lucky as he is shrewd. He has been blessed with an incompetent opposition and an American ally that has been willing to look past his domestic excesses for flimsy geostrategic reasons (three decades after the Cold War) and sentimentality for the era when Americans and Turks stood shoulder to shoulder against the Soviets. The Ukrainian maelstrom may be another one of Erdogan’s fortunes, giving him an opportunity to reprieve Turkey’s role as a regional troubleshooter and, in the process, advance the idea that Turkey is a global leader, ranking with players like Germany, France, and the United Kingdom.

Just a few months ago, Turkey was isolated internationally. Ankara’s relations with Europe were fraught after spending the better part of two years menacing Cyprus and Greece, threatening to unleash refugees on Europeans, and clashing with the French over Libya. In the Middle East, Ankara had difficult—even hostile—relations with every major country in the region. Turkey’s ties with the Saudis, Emiratis, Egyptians, and Israelis had deteriorated so much that those countries were linking up to oppose Ankara around the region and beyond. U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration mostly ignored Turkey and Erdogan, save the occasional criticism from the State Department podium. By late 2021, with Turkey isolated and experiencing an acute currency crisis, Ankara sought to repair the damage it had brought upon itself. There was an air of desperation to it all, however.

Then Russia invaded Ukraine. Almost immediately, two opposing accounts of Turkey’s response to the war developed. One claimed that Erdogan’s support for Ukraine’s independence, Ankara’s willingness to supply lethal drones to Kyiv, and the closure of the Bosphorus Strait was proof positive of the argument they had been making all along: Turkey was and remains a critical component of Western security. The other argued that there was less to Turkey’s alleged pro-Ukraine position than Ankara’s cheerleaders suggested. Critics highlighted the fact that the Turkish government had not sanctioned Russia, that Turkey’s airspace remained open to Russian planes, and that the superyachts of Russian oligarchs were showing up in Bodrum and Marmaris with the apparent approval of the Turkish government. This may have less to do with a pro-Russia policy in Ankara than the links between Russian and Turkish oligarchs, and the latter’s rumored connection to Erdogan, however.

Setting aside the information warfare between pro- and anti-Erdogan groups, the very fact that Turkey can neither be entirely pro-Ukraine nor entirely anti-Putin provides an opportunity for Erdogan to resume a role he played in the mid-2000s, while reinforcing the idea of Turkish power and independence in a way that is not just trolling the West. Few remember it, given the needlessly aggressive nature of Turkish foreign policy in recent years, but between roughly 2005 and 2011, the Turkish government sought to play a constructive role in the Middle East: overseeing indirect negotiations between Syrians and Israelis, deploying peacekeepers to Lebanon, seeking to outmaneuver Iran in Syria, and leveraging its economic weight to drive good relations between Ankara and a variety of countries in the region.

It seems there is an opportunity in Ukraine to reprieve this role. Critics have pooh-poohed Turkish mediation as merely an effort to match or one-up other would-be mediators (especially the Israelis) or as cover for Ankara’s pro-Russian position. There is a compelling logic to both critiques. Erdogan does not like to be overshadowed, especially by the Israeli prime minister, and Turkey has needed Russian forbearance so it could conduct military operation in Syria. Yet critics overlook what Erdogan brings to bear at the negotiating table––notably, his relationship with Putin. Few leaders with perhaps the exception of former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have spent more time with the Russian leader than Erdogan.

Of course, Putin is not known to accept the counsel of others, but Erdogan is better positioned than others to play this role. He is charismatic, a fellow strongman, and someone with whom cooperation—even in the face of profound policy differences—seems possible. The two men have done business before. And Erdogan is the leader of an important NATO country and thus a conduit to Washington and Brussels.

Would this bring the Russian war on Ukraine to an end? Putin is in too deep to declare victory and go home, but Erdogan can be helpful in efforts to establish humanitarian corridors and to deliver essential relief to Ukrainians in need. These are, of course, things that are easier said than done, but there does not seem to be a country better positioned than Turkey to try. The round of talks that ended in Istanbul on Tuesday hold out the hope of a cease-fire, providing much-needed relief for Ukrainians under siege.

Whether that cease-fire materializes or not, the good news for Erdogan is that he does not need to succeed to reclaim and reinforce the idea that Turkey can be a constructive actor in Europe, the Middle East, and the Eastern Mediterranean. It would also advance Ankara’s narrative that it is a leader in these regions. Odd as it is, but it may very well be that Turkey’s decision to purchase the S-400s and what that has meant for relations between Ankara and Moscow could—if Erdogan plays it right—be a critical factor in a return of Turkey’s power and prestige. It is sometimes better to be lucky than smart.",https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/03/29/ukraine-war-erdogan-peace-negotiation-ceasefire/

(Emrah Yorulmaz/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)

Senior members of the Ukrainian delegation who spoke with Russian officials today said there was progress after a day of talks in Turkey — and provided more detail on what security guarantees Ukraine would expect after a ceasefire.

Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, referred to talks about the status of Crimea, which annexed by Russia in 2014.

""I want to emphasize as regards the territories of Crimea and Sevastopol, it was agreed in bilateral format to take a pause for 15 years and conduct bilateral talks on the status of these territories,"" he said.

Ukraine and the West have refused to recognize the Russian annexation of the peninsula, and the pause could be a formula for taking the issue off the table for now.

""Separately, we discussed that during 15 years while the bilateral talks take place, there will be no military hostilities,"" Podolyak added.

He also referred to one of the toughest elements in the talks: security guarantees for Ukraine if and when a ceasefire and peace settlement are agreed upon.

""Undoubtedly, this treaty on security guarantees may only be signed after a ceasefire and the complete withdrawal of Russian troops to their positions on the 23rd of February 2022,"" he said.

""We are simply bringing our proposals as negotiators to Russia about the system of security guarantees of Ukraine,"" he continued.

Podolyak said the Russian negotiators have ""taken the treaty that outlines ways to end the war"" and will work out their counter-proposals.

He added that both sides are still ""discussing a humanitarian ceasefire,"" stressing there are ""many places where humanitarian corridors are needed.""

Another member of the Ukrainian team, David Arakhamia, also spoke about security guarantees. ""We insist that this be an international treaty, signing all the guarantors of security, which will be ratified.""

He said this would be comparable to NATO's Article 5, which enshrines the principle of collective defense. The arrangement, he said, would be similar to Article 5, ""but even with a stricter activation mechanism.""

""We say that consultations should take place within three days. They need to find out if this is war, aggression, a military operation. ... After that, the guarantor countries are obliged to help us. And military aid, and the armed forces, and weapons, and the closed sky — all that we need so much now, and we cannot get it. This is our proposal,"" he said.

Arakhamia named the guarantors as ""the [permanent] countries of the UN Security Council"" as well as Turkey, Germany, Canada, Italy, Poland and Israel.

""We have stipulated in this agreement that the guarantor countries must not only not deny Ukraine's accession to the EU, but also help with it,"" he said.

Arakhamia added: ""Of course, we have unresolved issues with the occupied parts of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, with Crimea and Sevastopol. And international security guarantees will not work temporarily in these territories.""

A third member of the Ukrainian delegation, Oleksandr Chalyi, also stressed the three-day deadline for consultations in the event of ""any aggression, military attack or military operation.""

""And if these consultations do not lead to a diplomatic solution to the problem, the guarantor countries must provide us with military assistance, weapons, and even we include such a situation as closed airspace over Ukraine,"" Chalyi said.

Speaking to Ukrainian television, he said: ""Doing everything possible to restore Ukraine's security is a key requirement. If we manage to consolidate these key provisions, which is the most fundamental requirement for us, Ukraine will in fact be in a position to fix its current status as a non-aligned and non-nuclear state in the form of permanent neutrality.""

""Accordingly, these guarantees, which are in fact in line with NATO Article 5, as required by our country's Constitution. [We] will not deploy foreign military bases or military contingents on our territory, and we will not enter into military-political alliances. Military trainings in our country will be conducted with the consent of our guarantor countries,"" Chalyi said.

""However, it is fundamental for us that nothing in these provisions will deny our accession to the EU. The guarantor countries are also committed to facilitating these processes,"" he added.",https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-29-22/h_c21a9cca46648c692e2f65ddf47d41c7

The Turkish capital has hosted the fifth round of talks since Russia decided more than a month ago to attack the Ukrainian country through a military invasion. Thus, a Ukrainian and a Russian delegation have met again in order to pave the way for a possible ceasefire at a time when Russian attacks on Ukraine have not ceased, but they have changed their strategy after declaring that they would only dedicate themselves to ""liberating the Donbas area"".

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has argued that a ceasefire agreement would pave the way for a face-to-face meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymir Zelenski and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, something that has not been ruled out but which, in the words of Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, must be ""well prepared"".

Before the meeting began, the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dymtro Kuleba, warned and advised his colleagues to avoid drinking and eating during the negotiations in order to avoid possible poisoning. In recent days we have learned that members of the Ukrainian delegation have suffered signs of poisoning, as well as the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, who has tried to mediate in the conflict.

On the sidelines of the meeting at the Dolmabahce Palace, Erdogan said that Turkey ""has witnessed a lot of suffering in the region"" and that they have worked ""to try to avoid a similar scenario in the northern Black Sea. We believe there will be no losers in a just peace. Prolonging the conflict is in nobody's interest,"" he said in a televised speech.

Similarly, the Turkish president was optimistic that ""there will be no losers in a just peace. Prolonging the conflict is not in anyone's interest"", which is why Erdogan advocates a ceasefire. So much so that he has stated that he ""hopes that these meetings will be beneficial for both countries and for the region"", in order to put an end to a conflict that ""worries"" the Turkish country. For the Turkish leader, the time has come for the ceasefire to cease ""as soon as possible. The whole world is waiting for good news from you"", he stressed.

This is the second time that Turkey has hosted the Russian-Ukrainian talks. The city of Antalya was the first Turkish city to stage the face-to-face meeting between Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers Sergei Lavrov and Dymtro Kuleba. So far, these meetings have been characterised by a slow pace and little progress, something Erdogan hopes will change in order to ""stop this tragedy"".

Turkey was precisely the country in which Russia rejected a ceasefire, as well as the creation of a humanitarian corridor in the city of Mariupol, one of the enclaves that is suffering the most from this conflict and where the civilian population is experiencing one of the most extreme situations due to the scarcity of food, as a result of being under siege.

Along with Turkey, Belarus has been one of the other countries that has been the scene of these peace negotiations, a country where Ukraine initially refused to go because of its direct aid to Moscow in its invasion strategy.

However, unlike Belarus, Turkey has openly stated that it would not be mediating directly in the negotiations, but it does facilitate understanding between the two, offering its country for the development of these negotiations and good understanding.

Erdogan made it clear that Turkey would not mediate directly after announcing that he was leaving for a trip to Uzbekistan, but leaving Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavasoglu in the country. ""We do not intend to mediate in the negotiations, but we will mediate"", he concluded.

These negotiations will last three days, according to one of the members of the Ukrainian delegation, David Arahamiya. After Zelenski learned of the duration of this new meeting, he expressed his willingness to talk about the status of neutrality of the Turkish state in the Russian-Ukrainian conflict.

However, the Ukrainian leader made it clear that it will only be possible to reach an agreement with Russia as long as the latter commits to the total withdrawal of its troops. He also refused to put on the table the concepts of ""denazification"" and ""demilitarisation"" of which Russia accuses them.

Alongside this, Zelensky stressed his desire to reach a compromise on the Donbas area. ""Let's go back to before this started and try to resolve the complex issue of Donbas,"" he said.

The Donbas issue is not the only party with which Zelensky has been more open to a possible dialogue. The Ukrainian leader has stated that ""it is impossible"" to force Moscow to completely leave the country, as this could lead to a Third World War.

All this comes at a time when Ukrainian intelligence has claimed that Russia is trying to split the country in two in order to create a sort of ""North Korea"", and after Russia has continued to attack with missiles infrastructures in the city of Lviv, a city located 80 kilometres from the border with Poland, while US President Joe Biden was in Warsaw.",https://atalayar.com/en/content/erdogan-defiende-un-alto-el-fuego-y-cree-que-las-negociaciones-facilitaran-un-cara-cara

Delegations from Russia and Ukraine are attending a fresh round of peace talks in Istanbul as Russia-Ukraine conflict drags on.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba says the Ukrainian side will not negotiate on people, land and sovereignty. (AA)

Ukraine has said it will be demanding a ceasefire and a sustainable agreement for it during peace talks with Russia in Istanbul, Türkiye.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told a local television channel that according to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s instructions, the Ukrainian side will not negotiate on people, land and sovereignty.

Delegations from Russia and Ukraine will hold the fresh round of peace talks on Tuesday as Russia’s onslaught on Ukraine has continued for over a month.

Kuleba said that during the talks, the minimum demand will be to resolve humanitarian issues and the maximum demand would be a ceasefire.

Security guarantees, he said, would have to be followed by a referendum in Ukraine.

Kuleba noted that the issue of holding a referendum will not be discussed in the negotiations beginning on Tuesday in Türkiye and that this is an internal matter of Ukraine.

The two days of talks, to be held at the Dolmabahce Presidential Office, are set to start at 0730GMT on Tuesday.

The talks will be closed to the press, according to the Turkish Foreign Ministry.

Civilian casualties

The Russia-Ukraine conflict, which started on February 24, has been met with international outrage, with the European Union, US and UK among others implementing tough financial sanctions on Moscow.

At least 1,151 civilians have been killed in Ukraine and 1,824 injured, according to estimates by the UN, which cautioned that the true figure is likely far higher.

More than 3.87 million Ukrainians have also fled to several European countries, with millions more displaced inside the country, according to the UN refugee agency.

ISTANBUL

Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu has said that the most meaningful progress in Russia-Ukraine negotiations was achieved in Istanbul since the teams of the two countries have launched peace talks.

“Today, we are pleased to see that the rapprochement between the parties has increased at every stage. Consensus and common understanding were reached on some issues,” Çavuşoğlu told reporters after the Russian-Ukrainian delegations met in Istanbul on March 29.

More difficult issues will be shaped by the foreign ministers of the two countries, he said. “We see more difficult issues will be tackled at higher levels. In the next period, it is foreseen that the foreign ministers of both countries will come together and give the final shape to the common understanding. Then, the meeting of the presidents of both countries is on the agenda,” the minister stated.

“Today’s talks are an indicator of trust to us. We are aware of the trust placed in us and our responsibility,” Çavuşoğlu stated.

The minister noted that the Turkish side also held separate meetings with the Ukrainian and Russian delegations and discussed the issues of humanitarian aid and humanitarian corridors.

“We have evacuated more than 16,500 of our citizens from Ukraine. We continue to work in coordination with parties and international organizations for the evacuation of both our citizens and third-country nationals,” he said, adding that they have also discussed the issues of exit and navigational safety of Turkish ships stranded in the region.

Erdoğan urges Russian, Ukrainian negotiators to end tragedy

President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan urged the Ukrainian and Russian negotiation teams for a peace agreement to “put an end to the tragedy” sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as the delegations held face-to-face talks in Istanbul on March 29.

“Ensuring a ceasefire and peace as soon as possible would benefit all parties. We think we have entered a period when concrete results should be achieved at the talks. Given the current progress, you as members of delegations have undertaken a historic responsibility,” Erdoğan said in his speech at the opening of the meeting of the delegations at the Presidential Dolmabahçe office.

“The entire world is awaiting beneficial and good news from you. You are laying the foundation for peace in line with the directives of your leaders. We stand ready for all kinds of contributions that will facilitate your work,” he added.

It will be in everyone’s interest to achieve a ceasefire and peace as soon as possible, Erdoğan said, expressing his optimism to obtain concrete results from the negotiations.

Expressing that Turkey does not have a mediating role in the negotiations, the president said, “However, as long as you request, we will continue to provide facilitating opportunities as long as you need.”

The progress they will make in the negotiations will also enable the next stage, the contact at the leaders’ level, he said, expressing readiness to host such a meeting.

The negotiation process raised hopes for peace and excited the whole world, and Turkey wholeheartedly supports the talks in this context, the president noted. Ankara has made sincere efforts at all levels to prevent escalation from the first day of the crisis and tried to fulfill the requirements of the neighborhood, friendship and proximity between societies of the countries, the president said.

“Personally, I carried out intense diplomatic work with many of my colleagues, especially your esteemed heads of state. At all international platforms, where we have a say, we have displayed a fair approach that protects, watches over the rights, laws and sensitivities of both parties,” Erdoğan stated. As a country that has witnessed many sufferings in its region, Turkey has worked to prevent a similar picture in the north of the Black Sea, Erdoğan added.

Emphasizing that Turkey has never shied away from assuming responsibility for peace and stability in the region and beyond, Erdoğan said, “We believe that there will be no losers in a just peace. Prolonging the conflict is not in anyone’s interest.”",https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/new-round-of-talks-in-istanbul-aims-to-stop-the-fighting-in-ukraine-172565

There appeared to be tangible progress, with Russia declaring that it would ""drastically reduce"" its offensive around Kyiv and another city ""to increase mutual trust"" and enable the talks to continue.

Ukrainian officials have been pushing for a ceasefire agreement to enable thousands of civilians to evacuate from besieged towns and cities that are still being bombed by Russian forces.

Russia's lead negotiator Vladimir Medinsky emerged from Tuesday's talks to say his country had received ""a clearly formulated position from Ukraine,"" and that ""the possibility of making peace will become closer"" as the two sides continue to work quickly to reach compromises.

Ukrainian negotiators also indicated some progress as the two sides seek to hammer out mutual ""security guarantees.""

David Arahamia, one of the Ukrainian negotiators, declared a ""first victory"" merely by having the venue for the negotiations moved from Belarus, a Russian ally on Ukraine's northern border, to Turkey. ""We see Turkey as one of our guarantor countries for Ukrainian safety.""

But the most significant declaration after Tuesday's talks came from Moscow, where the ministry of defense issued a statement saying it would ""reduce military activity"" in order to ""create the necessary conditions for further negotiations.""

Ukraine's leaders have made it clear since last week that they're willing to accept a formal neutral status for the country, ruling out NATO membership and accepting some constraints on its military, in exchange for an end to the war.

""Due to the fact that negotiations on the preparation of the treaty on the neutrality and non-nuclear status of Ukraine, as well as on the provision of security guarantees to Ukraine, are moving into practice, taking into account the principles discussed during today's meeting, by the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation — in order to increase mutual trust and create the necessary conditions for further negotiations and achievement of the ultimate goal… a decision was made to radically, at times, reduce military activity in the Kyiv and Chernihiv directions,"" Russia's Deputy Minister of Defense Alexander Fomin said.

It wasn't clear to what extent Russia's military would reduce its artillery barrage against Kyiv's suburbs and the decimated city of Chernihiv, close to the Russian border, but it was the first time Moscow had given any indication that it would reduce the intensity of its ""special military operation"" since it began on February 24.

Russia's defense ministry has said it will now focus its efforts on eastern Ukraine to ensure the ""independence"" of two breakaway regions held by Moscow-backed separatist fighters.

Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the round of Russia-Ukraine talks in his country had brought ""the most meaningful progress"" to date toward ending the war, but his American counterpart, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, was more cautious.

""I would leave it to our Ukrainian partners to characterize whether there is any genuine progress and whether Russia is engaging meaningfully,"" Blinken told reporters on Tuesday. ""What I can say is this: There is what Russia says, and there is what Russia does. We're focused on the latter. And what Russia is doing is the continued brutalization of Ukraine and its people. And that continues as we speak.""

While Russia's defense ministry pinned the change in tactics to the peace talks, a former Ukrainian ambassador told BBC News that, in his view, it was down to Russia being forced to accept realities on the ground.

""Maybe they realize that they are not winning this war, and they will never win,"" Ukraine's former ambassador to Austria, Dr. Olexander Scherba told the BBC after Tuesday's negotiations. ""We know what we are fighting for, Russians don't.""

CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams reports that Putin's ground forces have been stalled for weeks in their approach to Kyiv and other towns, and they're taking heavy losses. As many as 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in just over a month of fighting, according to an estimate by a NATO official.

Unable to advance due to logistical failures and stiff Ukrainian resistance, Russia has resorted to a war of attrition, pummeling cities from afar with missiles and artillery.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video address Monday evening that Russia's ""ruthless war against our nation"" had killed at least 143 children.

He lauded Ukraine's defense forces for refusing to let Russian troops take Kyiv, and said they were even pushing Putin's military out of some towns it had seized near the capital.

""Our defenders are advancing in the Kyiv region, returning control over Ukrainian territory,"" Zelenskyy said. ""The occupiers are getting pushed away from Irpin, from Kyiv. However, it is still too early to talk about security in this part of the region. The fighting continues.""

Williams and her team saw first-hand this week that advances by Ukraine's troops do not guarantee safety for the people living in towns that are reclaimed from Russia.

Williams was with Ukrainian forces as they traveled by road on Monday toward the town of Makariv, about 40 miles west of Kyiv. Ukraine said its troops recaptured Makariv last week, but as they approached, the Ukrainian forces spotted Russian drones flying overhead.

It was a tense situation. Twice the convoy left their vehicles by the side of the road and scattered for cover. The booms of shells landing could be heard nearby.

Williams said it was clear that Ukraine's fight for freedom could be long and dangerous.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-war-news-peace-talks-turkey-putin-reduce-military-activity/
