Dear Mr. President, my friend Andrzej!

Dear Mrs. Marshal of the Sejm! Dear Mr. Marshal of the Senate!

Ladies and gentlemen deputies and senators!

Dear Sirs!

Polish brothers and sisters!

When I became President in 2019, it felt like we had a long way to go with Poland.

Because our relationship was pretty cold, our attitude towards each other wasn’t too warm.

This was the situation. But I wanted to go this way fast. The path to warmth.

Because we are such nations. I knew that we were akin by nature - Ukrainians, Poles.

I remember my first meetings with Andrzej Duda. From meeting to meeting everything changed. The coolness disappeared. We understood each other. As a Ukrainian and a Pole. As Europeans. As friends. As parents who love their families and realize that our children must live in a world of equal good values. Our shared values. They must live in a world where nations are independent, where freedom reigns, where the family matters, and where no one ever has the right to war, to invasion.

It is believed that the number seven brings happiness. That is how many neighbors God has given to Ukraine. Does it bring us happiness? The whole world knows the answer today.

And 78 Ukrainian children who died from rockets and shelling of the Russian Federation know it better than others. A neighbor who brought trouble and war to our land. A neighbor who obviously acts without God.

When there is someone who beats like a savage, it is very important to have someone who will lend a hand. And when the foot of the enemy enters your house, he will lend you a helping hand.

On the morning of February 24, I had no doubt who it would be. Who will say to me: ""Brother, your people will not be left alone with the enemy.""

And so it happened. And I'm grateful for that. Polish brothers and sisters are with us. And this is natural.

Just in one day, on the first day of the war, it became clear to me and to all Ukrainians, and, I am sure, to all Poles that there are no more borders between us, between our nations. No physical ones. No historical ones. No personal ones.

During the 16 days of this war, Ukrainian pride and Polish honor, Ukrainian courage in battles and Polish sincerity in helping us allow me to say very important words now. Words that there is real peace between our nations. Peace between relatives. Peace between brothers. And now I really want these words to be heard by our common Belarusian neighbors.

Peace between relatives, peace between neighbors, peace between brothers. We have to come to this with them as well! We will definitely come!

Dear Sirs! Polish brothers and sisters!

For a long time, various ""stakeholders"" tried to create an impression that Ukrainians and Poles live differently. And separately. Why did they do all this?

I will recall the words of President of the Republic of Poland Lech Kaczyński said in Tbilisi in 2008: ""We know very well: today - Georgia, tomorrow - Ukraine, the day after tomorrow - the Baltic countries and then, perhaps, the time will come for my country - Poland”.

On February 24, this terrible ""tomorrow"" for Ukraine came, which President Kaczyński spoke about.

And today we are fighting for such a bad time for Poland and the Baltic States to never come. We fight together. We have strength.

Remember, there are 90 million of us together! We can do everything together. And this is the historical mission, the historical mission of Poland, the historical mission of Ukraine to be leaders who together will pull Europe out of this abyss, save it from this threat, stop the transformation of Europe into a victim.

Dear Sirs! We can do it.

We saw yesterday what the countries of the European Union talked about and in what manner. We saw who was the real leader and fought for a strong Europe. For common European security. And who tried to stop us, tried to stop you.

We understand why it is so important for Poles to fight with us. Together with all those who are for freedom. For us and for you, for Europe.

We remember the terrible tragedy of 2010 near Smolensk. We remember all the facts of the investigation into the circumstances of this catastrophe. We feel what this means for you. And what does the silence of those who also know all this mean to you, but... But they still feast their eyes on Russia.

Polish brothers and sisters!

I feel that we have already formed an extremely strong alliance. Even though it is informal. But this is an alliance that grew out of reality, not words on paper. Of the warmth in our hearts, not of the speeches of politicians at summits. Of the way you treated our people. Ukrainians who fled to your country to escape from the evil that came to our land.

More than one and a half million citizens of Ukraine! The vast majority are women and children. They do not feel like they are in a strange land. You met our people in your families. With Polish delicacy. With fraternal kindness.

Although we did not ask for it. And you did not ask anything for it. It's just the way it is between relatives.

That's why I address so simply: friend Andrzej, dear Agata!

That's why I claim that we have already united. We united to constantly gain and create freedom, as a great Pole, a close friend of Ukraine John Paul II said.

Today, I cannot be sure of all the leaders of all European nations, but I am sure that we will definitely be with you in defending freedom. As much as needed.

I am grateful for all the help we have already received from your state, from your people. I am grateful for your efforts so that we can secure the Ukrainian sky. I believe that we will be able to achieve the result in this, the result that we all desperately need.

If God allows and we win this war, we will share the victory with our brothers and sisters.

This is our greatness. And your greatness.

This is a struggle for our freedom, this is a struggle for your freedom.

This is the common history of great nations!

May God help us win!

Ukraine, in its battle against Russia, is not only fighting for its own freedom but also for Poland’s, Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, told a special assembly of both houses of the Polish parliament.

Before addressing the National Assembly, called to mark 23 years of Poland's membership in Nato, Zelensky received a standing ovation.

The Ukrainian president thanked Poland for its aid to Ukraine in its war with Russia, and said Ukraine's staunch opposition to Russia also served to secure Poland's freedom.

""The struggle against Russian aggression is a battle for our freedom, but also for yours. This is the common history of great nations,"" Zelensky said.

Zelensky especially thanked Poland for its recent efforts to secure a no-fly ruling over Ukraine.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the current war between the two countries burdened Ukraine and Poland with a ""historical mission"" to protect Europe from the threats the conflict embodied, he said.

""Poland and Ukraine have the historical mission to lead Europe away from the brink of disaster,"" Zelensky said. He added that Ukrainians and Poles together numbered 90 million and ""could do anything.""

The president also called Poland ""a true leader in the struggle for a united Europe and our common security.""",https://www.thefirstnews.com/article/ukraine-fighting-for-its-freedom-and-polands-zelensky-tells-polish-parliament-28676

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

How you can help: Here are ways those in the U.S. can help support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.

“When you are hurt, it is very important to have someone to lean on. And when the enemy sets foot in your house, someone reaches out to you. On the morning of February 24, I had no doubts who would say to me, ‘Brother, you will not find yourself alone against the enemy’,” the Ukrainian president said in his message to President Andrzej Duda, to Parliament and to the Polish people.

“And that’s exactly what happened. And I’m grateful for that. Our Polish brothers and sisters are with us”, he stressed, recalling that Poland currently hosts “more than one and a half million Ukrainian citizens, the absolute majority of whom are women and children”.

These refugees “do not feel like visitors. You welcomed them into your families with tenderness, fraternal kindness”, he underlines, recalling that bilateral relations were conversely “fresh” before his accession to the Ukrainian presidency in 2019.

A “peace between brothers” unites the two countries, he stressed, saying “wish these words would be heard by our neighbors, the people of Belarus”, an ally of Russia.

“Together we are 90 million inhabitants […] It is a historic mission for Poland and Ukraine to be the leaders who tomorrow will lift Europe out of this abyss, save it from this threat, prevent Europe from becoming a victim,” he added. he concluded.

President Biden strongly condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine during his annual State of the Union address on Tuesday. Here are some excerpts from his prepared remarks, as released by the White House.

PRESIDENT BIDEN: Six days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world, thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated.

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined.

He met the Ukrainian people.

From President Zelensky to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world.

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

In this struggle as President Zelensky said in his speech to the European Parliament, “Light will win over darkness.” The Ukrainian ambassador to the United States is here tonight.

Let each of us here tonight in this chamber send an unmistakable signal to Ukraine and to the world.

Please rise if you are able and show that, yes, we the United States of America stand with the Ukrainian people.

Throughout our history we’ve learned this lesson when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression they cause more chaos.

They keep moving.

And the costs and the threats to America and the world keep rising.

That’s why the NATO Alliance was created to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War II.

The United States is a member along with 29 other nations.

It matters. American diplomacy matters. American resolve matters.

Putin’s latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and unprovoked.

He rejected repeated efforts at diplomacy.

He thought the West and NATO wouldn’t respond. And he thought he could divide us at home. Putin was wrong. We were ready. Here is what we did.

We prepared extensively and carefully.

We spent months building a coalition of other freedom-loving nations from Europe and the Americas to Asia and Africa to confront Putin.

I spent countless hours unifying our European allies. We shared with the world in advance what we knew Putin was planning and precisely how he would try to falsely justify his aggression.

We countered Russia’s lies with truth.

And now that he has acted, the free world is holding him accountable.

Along with 27 members of the European Union, including France, Germany, Italy, as well as countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and many others, even Switzerland.

We are inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine. Putin is now isolated from the world more than ever.

Together with our allies — we are right now enforcing powerful economic sanctions.

We are cutting off Russia’s largest banks from the international financial system. Preventing Russia’s central bank from defending the Russian ruble, making Putin’s $630 Billion “war fund” worthless.

We are choking off Russia’s access to technology that will sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come.

Tonight, I say to the Russian oligarchs and corrupt leaders who have bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime, “No more.”

The U.S. Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs.

We are joining with our European allies to find and seize their yachts their luxury apartments their private jets. We are coming for your ill-begotten gains.

And tonight I am announcing that we will join our allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights, further isolating Russia and adding an additional squeeze on their economy. He has no idea what’s coming.

The Ruble has lost 30 percent of its value.

The Russian stock market has lost 40 percent of its value, and trading remains suspended. The Russian economy is reeling, and Putin alone is to blame.

Together with our allies, we are providing support to the Ukrainians in their fight for freedom. Military assistance. Economic assistance. Humanitarian assistance.

We are giving more than $1 billion in direct assistance to Ukraine, and will continue to aid the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and help ease their suffering.

But let me be clear: Our forces are not engaged and will not engage in conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine.

Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO Allies — in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west.

For that purpose we’ve mobilized American ground forces, air squadrons, and ship deployments to protect NATO countries including Poland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia.

As I have made crystal clear: The United States and our allies will defend every inch of territory of NATO countries with the full force of our collective power. Every single inch.

And we remain cleareyed. The Ukrainians are fighting back with pure courage. But the next few days, weeks and months will be hard on them.

Putin has unleashed violence and chaos. But while he may make gains on the battlefield, he will pay a continuing high price over the long run.

And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backward.

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I always promised I would be. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world.

And I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers.

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming.

But I want you to know that we are going to be OK.

When the history of this era is written, Putin’s war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.

While it shouldn’t have taken something so terrible for people around the world to see what’s at stake, now everyone sees it clearly.

We see the unity among leaders of nations, a more unified Europe a more unified West. And we see unity among the people who are gathering in cities in large crowds around the world even in Russia to demonstrate their support for the people of Ukraine.

In the battle between democracy and autocracy, democracies are rising to the moment, and the world is clearly choosing the side of peace and security.

This is a real test. It’s going to take time. So let us continue to draw inspiration from the iron will of the Ukrainian people.

To our fellow Ukrainian Americans who forge a deep bond that connects our two nations we stand with you.

Putin may circle Kyiv with tanks, but he will never gain the hearts and souls of the Ukrainian people.

He will never extinguish their love of freedom. He will never weaken the resolve of the free world.",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/03/01/world/ukraine-russia-war
