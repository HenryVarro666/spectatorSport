They didn’t make it.

A shell fired into the Kyiv suburb of Irpin by Vladimir Putin’s forces killed the family instantly. Video of the attack would travel around the world, as a shocking encapsulation of the cruelty of the Kremlin’s murderous invasion.

Minutes after the blast, emergency responders covered the body of Tatyana Perebeynos as well as her daughter Alise, 9, and son Nikita, 18. Their roll-on bag was the only thing left standing.

Kyiv: In its fourth week of the Russia-Ukraine war, new satellite images from Maxar Technologies shows damage from Moscow military strikes across Irpin, northwest of Kyiv in Ukraine.

Two distinct fires are seen in central Irpin near a complex of city government and apartment buildings. The images show fires from military strikes and growing flooding from the Irpin River, CNN reported.

Explosions and bursts of gunfire shook Kyiv, and black smoke rose from a spot in the north. Intensified artillery fire could be heard from the northwest, where Russia has sought to encircle and capture several suburban areas of the capital, a crucial target.

Russian forces also continued their siege of Mariupol after the southern port city’s defenders refused demands to surrender, with fleeing civilians describing relentless bombardments and corpses lying in the streets. But the Kremlin’s ground offensive in other parts of the country advanced slowly or not at all, knocked back by lethal hit-and-run attacks by the Ukrainians.

Early Tuesday, Ukrainian troops drove Russian forces out of the Kyiv suburb of Makariv after a fierce battle, Ukraine's Defense Ministry said. The regained territory allowed Ukrainian forces to retake control of a key highway and block Russian troops from surrounding Kyiv from the northwest.

Still, the Defense Ministry said Russian forces were able to partially take other northwest suburbs, Bucha, Hostomel and Irpin, some of which had been under attack almost since Russia's military invaded almost a month ago.

Russia's invasion has driven more than 10 million people from their homes, almost a quarter of Ukraine's pre-war population, according to the United Nations. The U.N. has confirmed 953 civilian deaths while saying the real toll is probably much higher.

Estimates of Russian military casualties in the grinding war have been hard to come by and vary, but even conservative figures by Western officials are in the low thousands. Russia has not given an update since it said March 2 that 498 soldiers had been killed in action in Ukraine. Russia’s pro-Kremlin Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper, citing the Defense Ministry, briefly reported Monday that almost 10,000 Russian soldiers had been killed. The report was quickly removed, and newspaper blamed hackers. The Kremlin refused to comment on Tuesday.

Beyond the terrible human toll, the war has shaken the post-Cold War global security consensus, imperiled the global supply of key crops including wheat, and repeatedly raised worries it could set off a nuclear accident. Ukraine's natural resources minister said wildfires near the Chernobyl nuclear power plant have been extinguished and radiation levels in the area are within norms. Fires are not uncommon in the area, but raise concern about the potential release of radiation from fallout from the 1986 explosion and fire at the plant.

Concerns have been expressed for safety at the decommissioned plant since it was seized by Russian forces last month. The power supply was temporarily cut amid fighting earlier this month, and Ukraine’s nuclear regulatory agency said Monday that radiation monitors around the plant had stopped working.

Facing unexpectedly stiff resistance, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces are increasingly concentrating their air power and artillery on Ukraine’s cities and the civilians living there. A senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the military’s assessment, said Russia had increased its air sorties, carrying out as many as 300 over a 24-hour period.

U.S. and British officials say Kyiv remains Russia's primary objective. The bulk of Moscow’s forces remain miles from the center, but missiles and artillery have destroyed apartment buildings and a large shopping mall, which was left a smoking ruin after being hit late Sunday by strikes that killed eight people, according to emergency officials.

U.S. President Joe Biden, who is heading to Europe later in the week to meet with allies, suggested Monday evening that worse may be still to come.

“Putin’s back is against the wall,” Biden said. “He wasn’t anticipating the extent or the strength of our unity. And the more his back is against the wall, the greater the severity of the tactics he may employ.""

THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor

Biden reiterated accusations that Putin is considering resorting to using chemical or biological weapons, though Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Tuesday that the United States has seen no evidence to suggest that use of such weapons was ""imminent.""

Talks to end the fighting have continued by video but failed to bridge the chasm between the two sides. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told Ukrainian television late Monday that he would be prepared to consider waiving any bid by Ukraine to join NATO — a key Russian demand — in exchange for a cease-fire, the withdrawal of Russian troops and a guarantee of Ukraine’s security.

Zelenskyy also suggested Kyiv would be open to future discussions on the status of Crimea, which Russia seized in 2014, and areas of the eastern Donbas region held by Russian-backed separatists. But he said that was a topic for another time.

As part of a series of addresses to foreign legislatures to drum up support for Ukraine, Zelenskyy spoke to Italian lawmakers on Tuesday, telling them that the besieged port of Mariupol had been utterly destroyed in the Russian onslaught. He also spoke to Pope Francis.

“Imagine a Genoa completely burned down,” he said to rapt lawmakers, citing an Italian port city of a similar size. Mariupol officials said on March 15 that at least 2,300 people had died in the siege, and they have not given an update since. Zelenskyy said 117 children had been killed in the war so far.

Some people managed to flee Mariupol, where weeks of Russian bombardment has cut off electricity, water and food supplies and severed communication with the outside world. The city council said Tuesday that more than 1,100 people who had escaped the besieged city were on their way in a convoy of buses to another city to Mariupol's northwest.

But the Red Cross said a humanitarian aid convoy trying to reach the embattled city with desperately needed supplies still had not been able to enter.

Perched on the Sea of Azov, Mariupol is a crucial port for Ukraine and lies along a stretch of territory between Russia and Crimea. The siege of Mariupol has cut the city off from the sea and allowed Russia to establish a land corridor to Crimea.

But it's not clear how much of the city it holds, with fleeing residents saying fighting continues street by street. Ukraine's Defense Ministry said Tuesday that their forces were still defending the city and had destroyed a Russian patrol boat and electronic warfare complex. Britain's Defense Ministry said its intelligence showed that “Ukrainian forces continue to repulse Russian attempts to occupy” the city.

Those who have made it out of Mariupol told of a devastated city.

“Mariupol is almost 99% destroyed,” said 39-year-old Viktoria Totsen, who managed to escape the city and cross into Poland. “They bombed us for the past 20 days. During the last five days the planes were flying over us every five seconds and dropped bombs everywhere — on residential buildings, kindergartens, art schools, everywhere.”

In all, more than 8,000 people escaped to safer areas Monday through humanitarian corridors, including about 3,000 from Mariupol, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said.

Overall, more than 3.5 million people have fled Ukraine, while another 6.5 million have been displaced inside the country.

Matthew Saltmarsh, a spokesperson for the U.N. refugee agency, called the speed and scale of people fleeing danger in Ukraine ""unprecedented in recent memory.”

More than 100 kilometers on foot with cows. When the evacuation began in Irpen, one of the residents did not leave because there was no room for his bull and cow on the bus. The man did not agree to all the persuasions to leave the animals and decided to get relatives in the Zhytomyr region on his own. Both day and night he walked, ignored the shelling and still got home.

This is stated in TSN.

“Cows came from Irpen, that’s what the Russians did. Poor animals have nowhere to go, ”say Kyivans stunned by cows on the streets of the capital.

“It simply came to my notice then. If I looked in the mirror, in the eyes, how I would look at people, “said 44-year-old Andriy Mikhailov, who went all the way with the animals.

Andrew says he would not forgive himself if he left them under the bullets. After all, at first he sat with the cow Martha and the bull Troika under fire in his native Irpen, then hid with them in the local swamp. So, when the evacuation was announced, he decided to flee to Zhytomyr Region together with the animals.

“Kyiv was the first night, then Belogorodka, Hnativka, then I went to Byshev, and then there was Korostyshev,” the man recalls.

15 villages passed in a week. All this time, after seeing the video, volunteers were looking for a man with Troika and Mane. They tried to warn that the Zhytomyr highway, which is full of Russians, is deadly. The post was reposted by more than 2,000 people, but in vain. Those who stood at the checkpoints on social networks did not see and perceived Andriy as a saboteur.

They also stopped in Byshev, say the Armed Forces of Ukraine, put the barrels on their knees, and almost shot their own. What’s in the bags? I showed. They say he is really a refugee. Looked, ask is there water? I say no, they gave me some chocolates or something, ”says Andriy.

People in the villages also helped as much as they could, the man says. They offered both housing and food, but Andrew chose to spend the night in the open air. “They treated me, asked what I needed, roughly speaking, I took what I needed. If you want, help the cattle with water, ”says the cattle rescuer.

So Andrew, Mania and Troika walked more than 100 kilometers. The last 15 – to the grandfather’s house, when the animals were very tired, they were taken by truck. Aunt Tatiana, with whom he had not spoken for almost 1.5 years, was already waiting for her husband at home.

“I was very worried because we had a difficult relationship, there were misunderstandings. And as they say, my aunt’s heart changed and she said well done, “says Andriy.

“When I saw Andryusha walking with cows, I threw myself on his neck, hugged and kissed him warmly, hugged him, I say, how smart you are,” adds Aunt Tatiana.

Troika should rejoice the most in escaping the shelling, laughs his master, because he is now the only bull in two villages.

But everyone in the village is also very happy for Andriy, because they followed his search through the Internet and were very worried. But Andrew himself does not see anything extraordinary in his actions. “It’s just, as they say, it’s my job, my responsibility,” says Andriy.
