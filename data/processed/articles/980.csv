The southern city is a key obstacle for Russian forces trying to move west from Crimea to take Odessa, Ukraine's major port on the Black Sea, and it has taken a battering in the more than three weeks since Russian troops invaded. However, citizens are determined to stay and defend it despite incessant bombardment.

Almost a month ago, Russia sent troops over the border on what it calls a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its neighbor's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists. The United Nations human rights office said on Tuesday it had recorded 953 civilian deaths, however, the Kremlin denies targeting civilians. Russian forces tried to storm Mykolaiv on March 4 but met with fierce resistance.

In the eastern Inhulskyi district of the city, an unexploded artillery rocket can be seen sticking up from the pavement, a traffic cone planted alongside it to warn motorists.

A bit further, in the city's vast cemetery, another unexploded rocket has burrowed into the ground nearly up to its fins. Smoke from burning garbage hangs in the air.

It's there that a dozen family and friends have gathered to bury Igor Dundukov, 46. He was killed along with dozens of other soldiers last Friday, when the military barracks came under fire. His elder brother, Sergei, weeps as he kisses Dundukov's swollen, blood-stained face.

Sergei's wife, Galina, slips a crucifix into a pocket of Dundukov's fatigues before the coffin is sealed and lowered into the ground. Igor enlisted at the start of the invasion, Sergei told Agence France-Presse (AFP).

""We supported his commitment to defending our homeland,"" he added, dismissing any idea of leaving the city despite the boom of artillery fire in the distance.

""This is our land. We live here. And where would we run to? Where would we run to? We grew up here.""

Galina agreed. ""We were born here and grew up here. And we don't have anywhere else to go. No relatives abroad. No-one.""

If a good part of the city's 500,000 prewar residents have fled – mostly towards Odessa, some 130 kilometers (80 miles) to the southwest – those that remain are determined to hold out.

In the afternoon, an airstrike gutted a building. Witnesses say it was a hotel with a bank branch on the ground floor. Several hundred meters away, Anatoly Yakunin, 79, calmly picked up debris and sweeps broken glass.

""Leave? But to do what?"" he asked. ""I have four grandchildren here, one who is fighting. How could I leave them?""

In the Kulbakino district, which includes several blocks of residential buildings, the population has fallen from 12,000 to fewer than 1,000, according to Alexander Zadera. The 56-year-old had to pull his octogenarian mother from her apartment after the building was struck on March 7.

""We've got used to eating with that sort of background noise,"" he said of the fighting at the nearby front. ""Now even my mother recognizes the sounds of different types of artillery and missile fire,"" the former air force colonel added wryly.

The building's residents have set themselves up in the basement for the duration. At the back, between two mattresses, a game of backgammon has been left waiting while the residents share tea in the candle-lit main room.

""We pass our evenings here praying for our soldiers, our homeland,"" said schoolteacher Inna Kouriy. ""Every time there is a raid or a strike, we come down here. And when things calm down we go back up, and so on,"" she adds.

Kouriy tries to organize remote classes for her students who have left the city or the country. ""There were quite a few of us here at the beginning but many left the city because they had children or family. But we're staying until the end,"" she says. ""We Ukrainians are patient people but we won't give our country up to anyone.""

Every little bit helps

The courtyard of the psychiatric hospital in Mykolaiv reverberates with the sound of broken glass being swept up by staff and volunteers. Every day, residents clean up the debris from the latest bombardment by the Russian army and prepare for the next.

Using whatever resources they can lay their hands on, they are just some of those trying to do their bit to support the Ukrainian forces who have so far frustrated the Russian push towards Odessa.

Nurse Svetlana Muraska, her eyes red from crying, weeps anew as she sees the crater that has appeared in front of the women's detoxification center at the hospital. The center's facade has also been blown away in the blast.

But despite the damage, the strike caused no casualties, Oleg Kondratenko, a manager at the facility, told AFP. ""The patients of the psychiatric hospital are in other buildings that were not hit,"" he said.

In the main courtyard, staff and a handful of young volunteers were working to clear away the most visible traces of the bombardment, sweeping and picking up the shattered glass.

""Faced with the Russian aggression, we have to participate in some way,"" said one young volunteer in a black beanie and down jacket. ""I want to join the territorial defense corps, but they don't have enough weapons for everyone, so for now I'm helping out like this,"" he added. ""We have to clean everything because they can bomb again and if there is still broken glass lying around it will be even more dangerous.""

""Yesterday we cleaned a warehouse and protected the windows with tape,"" he added. ""I'm a handyman, I need to do something and I'm more useful here,"" he said, before the hospital manager interrupted him and prevents him from giving his name or saying more for security reasons.

Oleg Yarshenko, a road maintenance worker in peacetime, and his wife Lilia drove around the area in a brown van, asking those manning security checkpoints what they need and, if possible, supplying it.

He can offer them ""firewood, cigarettes and food,"" but also medicines and sleeping bags, said the 54-year-old, sporting a straggly beard and walking with a cane.

The company he works for also has lorries ferrying supplies to surrounding villages whose access roads have been destroyed, said Yarshenko, whose children fled to Bulgaria a few days ago.

""You have to be totally mentally deranged to start a war in the 21st century,"" he said of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

In the car park of a supermarket, one of the city's remaining businesses, Nikolai Oskchik, a 69-year-old widower, was also making his modest contribution to the war effort.

With the help of a deaf-mute friend, he spread out a jumble of bric-a-brac – hoover parts, kitchen accessories and other utensils – on the bonnet of his blue Moskvitch car, a 37-year-old Soviet antique. He said he gives his wares to the military, or sells them to troops ""at half price"" to buy himself medicine.

""I'm too old to fight,"" sighed Oskchik, the father of a military nurse. ""But at least I can do this for them.""

Stress prompts baby boom

Just minutes old, baby Katya lies on her mother Tamara Kravchuk's chest, unaware of the joy and solace she has brought. It is a moment of bliss and gratitude, despite the war raging close by.

""I'm so happy. No matter what happens now – I'm the happiest person ... my daughter is healthy. God willing there will be peace,"" 37-year-old Kravchuk, lying in a hospital bed in Mykolaiv, told Reuters.

Staring at her new daughter's face and tiny hands, she talks of the future. The desperation and anxiety that dominated her thoughts before Katya's birth are gone – for now.

""I think the war will end and we will live as it was before, our life will be calm again,"" said Kravchuk. ""I hope our children won't see all these crazy things and everything will be good.""

The head of the maternity ward, Valentin Podaranchuk, was all smiles after delivering Katya. ""A new life is born, despite all the horrors happening around,"" said the 39-year-old. ""That's why we still have hope. Today a new little girl came to our world.""

The Russian invasion brought a wave of new births in Mykolaiv, as women went into labor through stress, said Podaranchuk. Katya is baby 49 since the war began on Feb. 24.

""During the first 10 days we had a baby boom – a lot of births. I think this is because of a lot of stress ... It was very unusual.""

Now the birth rate is back to normal for the hospital, but many people have fled the city.

Before having Katya, Kravchuk had been fearful, especially when there were explosions 500 meters (yards) from the hospital, she said.

""I'm really scared of what's going to happen next, how it's going to end.""",https://www.dailysabah.com/world/europe/ukrainians-vow-to-stay-in-mykolaiv-key-city-holding-off-russians

Since then Kyiv, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Mariupol and many other cities have been under constant attack.

Some of the most shocking images of the conflict are emerging from the besieged southern port city of Mariupol, which has been almost entirely destroyed with thousands of people dead, according to local authorities.

Civilians across the country have been targeted in their homes, hospitals, schools or on the streets as they tried to flee the fighting. Those who stayed -- by choice, or by necessity -- have sheltered in underground bunkers, their cellars and basements, or metro stations.

Conventional wisdom says the Ukrainian military should have been overwhelmed in a matter of days by Russian forces, however the resistance and leadership of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy became a symbol of bravery and resilience for the whole nation.

The images emerging from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are reminders of what wars often prove: cities are both key strategic targets and the places that bear the greatest costs of conflict.

Towns and villages in the path of the Russian advance have also been devastated. But it is the cities, which were home to about two-thirds of Ukraine’s 44 million people before the invasion, that are the focus of the Russian assault.

Now, from Kharkiv and Kyiv in the north to Mariupol in the south, many women and children have fled, and urban neighborhoods are becoming battlegrounds.

“We ask that the alliance declare that it will fully assist Ukraine to win this war, clear our territory of the invaders and restore peace in Ukraine,” he says during his nightly video address to the nation.

Zelenskyy will speak to the NATO summit by video, the president’s office says.

He appeals to Western countries to stay united in the face what he says are Russia’s efforts to “lobby its interests” with “some partners” to bring them over to its side.

“We will see who is a friend, who is a partner and who has sold out and betrayed us,” he says in an emotional speech. “Together we should not allow Russia to break anyone in NATO, the EU or G-7, to break them and drag them to the side of war.”

Zelenskyy notes that Ukrainian skies are still not closed to Russian aircraft and missiles and that Ukraine hasn’t received the fighter jets or modern air-defense systems it requested. He says Ukraine also needs tanks and anti-ship systems.

“It has been a month of defending ourselves from attempts to destroy us, wipe us off the face of the earth,” he said. “We have lasted six times longer than the enemy had planned … but the Russian troops are destroying our cities, killing civilians indiscriminately, raping women, kidnapping children, shooting refugees, capturing aid columns and looting.”

Switching to Russian, Zelenskyy appealed to Russians “to leave Russia so as not to give your tax money to the war.” Tens of thousands of Russians already have fled Russia since the war began, fearing the intensifying crackdown at home.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-march-23-2022/

MYKOLAIV, Ukraine — Sergey was at the morgue to pick up the body of his baby brother. Then he walked into a room with corpses organized in rows on the floor. Most were dressed in military fatigues and mangled. Some were missing limbs. He wondered if he knew some of them, he said, but it’s hard to keep track of who is alive and who is dead these days.

“There must have been 200 in there,” said Sergey, a Ukrainian soldier. Like others in this report, The Washington Post is only identifying him by first name for security reasons and in keeping with military rules.

Ukraine’s southern front-line city of Mykolaiv is considered a success story for how its military has defended against Russia’s invasion. This is where Ukrainian forces have held their ground, delaying any Russian offensive on the strategically critical Black Sea port of Odessa. This is where they’ve even launched counterattacks to push back Russian troops. And this is where bodies continue to pile up.

While Ukrainian forces have inflicted punishing losses on the Russians, interviews this week at Mykolaiv’s front lines, funeral homes, morgues, cemeteries and residential neighborhoods illustrated the terrible price Ukraine has paid in lives lost.

Ukraine’s military has not released any casualty figures. But in Mykolaiv just this past week, Russian missiles struck a Ukrainian barracks, killing dozens. Blue-and-yellow flags around the city were lowered to half-staff. At the morgue, one van after another arrived with a “200” sign in the front windshield — an old Soviet marker for a vehicle transporting a corpse. Some bodies were delivered wrapped in checkered picnic blankets.

“Their methods of warfare are incomprehensible to a normal person — and a not normal person,” said Andriy, a Ukrainian sergeant who’s posted at one of the front-line positions in Mykolaiv. “They’re bombing peaceful cities. They’re bombing barracks with new recruits sleeping inside. But they won’t come storm our actual military positions.”

Meanwhile, Mykolaiv Gov. Vitaliy Kim has urged residents to notify local authorities when they come across “the many” Russian cadavers left strewn around the city’s outskirts. He said people could also just place the corpses in bags, which will eventually be shipped back to Russian mothers because “we’re not animals.”

“The problem is they don’t always take their bodies,” Kim said in a video message on Telegram on Saturday. “The dogs won’t eat that much. Same with the wolves.”

Dmitry Smirnov, who owns a funeral home in Mykolaiv, said the city of 500,000 typically sees about 20 deaths per day. At the height of the coronavirus pandemic, that jumped to 50 per day, he estimated. Now, Smirnov said, the city is dealing with more than 100 deaths per day — not counting the Russians.

His funeral home and others will soon reach a breaking point. He only has enough caskets to last until the end of this week. The wood to make them was typically sourced from forests in the Kherson region, which is now largely occupied by Russian forces. Some bodies might soon have to be buried in sealed bags.

At the cemetery, gravedigger Yuri Malashuk starts his days surveying the grounds for new artillery shells. At least one had landed there nearly every night since the start of the war, he said. Some have disturbed graves. Several fell on a nearby landfill, setting fire to the trash and causing pungent smoke to waft over the cemetery.

“Even the sacred places aren’t safe,” Malashuk said.

The near-constant booming thuds in the distance have scared some people away from coming to the graveyard, sacrificing saying goodbye for safety. In the past month, Malashuk has dug graves for whole families who had to be buried by their neighbors. He’s also dug solitary plots for men — left behind after their family members evacuated. Ukraine is requiring men between 18 and 60 to remain in the country to fight.

“I’m sorry for our guys. We are burying them every day,” he said.

Analysts at the Institute for the Study of War think tank have predicted that “if the war in Ukraine settles into a stalemate condition, Russian forces will continue to bomb and bombard Ukrainian cities, devastating them and killing civilians, even as Ukrainian forces impose losses on Russian attackers and conduct counterattacks of their own.”

With much of their artillery now out of range of Mykolaiv’s downtown, the Russian military on Monday dropped a bomb on a hotel, the first strike in the city center. No one was seriously injured in the blast — the hotel had been empty — but several apartment buildings behind it were damaged. Less than an hour after the explosion, residents were on the streets outside, working together to sweep up debris from their homes’ walls and windows.

Across the street from the hotel was another barracks for local law enforcement. When the bomb dropped, shattered glass flew onto their cots. Three officers sustained minor injuries. The unit’s commander, Oleksi, sat in the lobby with gauze wrapped around his hand and his knee. He considered himself more lucky than wounded.

“Russians are trying to intimidate the population,” he said. “It’s all psychological pressure to create panic.”

At the trenched front line the next day, soldiers sat around jars of borscht and cured lard that volunteers had brought them. They were waiting for the orders to move their trench positions forward, in the direction of the Russian military in Ukraine’s southeast.

A different unit, just one kilometer ahead, was hit with artillery shells overnight.

“They are more or less okay,” said Maksim, a soldier. “The losses aren’t big.”

“The enemy has suffered quite significant casualties, both the injured and the killed,” he added. “Well, this is what war is about.”

At the morgue, Sergey spoke of the toll of a month of war on his family and friends. He said his brother Danil was 17 when he died during a shootout with Russian troops. He had wanted to defend his country like his older brothers, so he joined the local Territorial Defense Forces. He was two days short of his 18th birthday when he died.

Sergey carpooled to the morgue with two other families from his neighborhood to pick up their dead together.

“How do I bring our mother her dead son right now?” he asked. “I just have no idea.”

“I mean, talk about what happened to Tiananmen Square. This is Tiananmen Square squared,” he said.

“These posts are unacceptable. We made that clear today to the Russian Ambassador,” France’s foreign ministry said in a statement sent to the Reuters news agency.

“We are trying to maintain a demanding channel of dialogue with Russia and these actions are completely inappropriate.”

Switzerland’s government says it has adopted more EU sanctions against Russia after pledging to act in step with the bloc as it moves to financially punish Moscow.

“This means that all measures contained in the EU’s fourth package of sanctions have been implemented,” the country’s cabinet said in a statement.

However, the cabinet said it had decided not to implement the EU measure of March 1 suspending the broadcasting of Russian media outlets Sputnik and Russia Today.

“Despite the fact that these outlets are used to spread targeted propaganda and disinformation by the Russian Federation, the Federal Council is of the opinion that it is more effective to counter untrue and harmful statements with facts instead of preventing them from being broadcast,” it added.

Dozens of Ukrainian officials, journalists detained, disappeared: UN

Dozens of Ukrainian officials, journalists and activists have been detained or forcibly disappeared by invading Russian forces, the UN has warned, saying that some cases resembled “hostage-taking”.

The UN’s human rights office (OHCHR) said it had documented the arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance of 22 local Ukrainian officials, 13 of whom had subsequently been released, since Moscow launched its attack.

At least 15 journalists and civil society activists “who vocally opposed the invasion” in several regions had also been taken, Matilda Bogner, OHCHR’s representative in Ukraine, said in a statement.

“This does seem to be a pattern that is occurring in areas that are occupied by the Russian Federation,” she said.

“Forces of the Russian Federation are going specifically to detain, and do not inform relatives and others where they are taking people … That does in some cases appear to be a form of hostage-taking.”

Moscow updates troop death toll, says 1,351 killed

Russia’s army has updated its troop death toll, saying 1,351 soldiers have been killed and 3,825 others wounded since the start of its offensive in Ukraine.

The new toll, announced at a Moscow briefing delivered by senior military officials, came several weeks after Moscow gave its first assessment of losses in the conflict on March 2.

At the time, Russia put the number of its forces killed at 498.

Kyiv says more than 16,000 Russian troops have been killed, while NATO officials have told Al Jazeera they believe the death toll on the Russian side amounts to between 7,000-15,000 personnel.

Russia says first phase of Ukraine ‘operation’ mostly complete

Russia has said the first phase of its “military operation” in Ukraine is mostly complete and that it will now focus on completely “liberating” eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region.

The Russian defence ministry said Russian-backed separatists now controlled 93 percent of Ukraine’s Luhansk region and 54 percent of the Donetsk region – the two areas that jointly make up the Donbas.

“The combat potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has been considerably reduced, which … makes it possible to focus our core efforts on achieving the main goal, the liberation of Donbas,” Sergei Rudskoi, head of the Russian General Staff’s Main Operational Directorate, said.

The defence ministry added that it did not rule out storming Ukrainian cities that had been blockaded and said that Russia would react immediately to any attempt to close the airspace over Ukraine – something Kyiv has asked NATO to do, but NATO has resisted.

It said that Moscow’s offensive would continue until Russian forces had completed the tasks that had been set by Russian President Vladimir Putin, without saying what those tasks were.

Russia’s military had considered two options for its operation in Ukraine, one confined to the Donbas and the other on the whole territory of Ukraine, before opting for the latter, according to Rudskoi.

Local officials say 300 killed in Mariupol theatre bombing

Mariupol’s local government, citing witnesses, has said about 300 people were killed last week when Russian forces struck a theatre in the besieged city that was being used as a makeshift bomb shelter.

The southeastern port city’s authorities provided the toll in a Telegram post. Al Jazeera was unable to independently verify the figures provided.

When the theatre was struck on March 16, an enormous inscription reading “CHILDREN” was posted outside in Russian, intended to be visible from the skies above.

Soon after the bombing, Ludmyla Denisova, the Ukrainian Parliament’s human rights commissioner, said more than 1,300 people had been sheltering in the building. Russia has denied attacking the theatre and targeting civilians amid its offensive.

“We will do everything in our power so that buses filled with Mariupol residents reach Zaporizhzhia today,” she added.

Mariupol, which is normally home to about 400,000 people, has been under heavy bombardment from Russian forces for weeks. Those trapped there have been sheltering in basements with little food, power or running water.

EU pens new deal with US aimed at reducing reliance on Russian gas

The US and EU have announced a new deal on liquefied natural gas (LNG) aimed at reducing Europe’s reliance on Russian energy imports.

The agreement, unveiled by Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at a news conference in Brussels, will see the US supply the bloc with at least 15 billion additional cubic metres of the fuel this year.

“This will replace the LNG supply we currently receive from Russia,” von der Leyen said.

She added the EU will work with member states to also ensure they can receive at least 50 bcm of additional LNG until 2030.

About 10 percent of the EU’s gas needs are met by production within the bloc. Russia typically supplies about 41 percent of the rest of the LNG used by its member states.

59 percent of Russian missiles malfunctioned, downed or missed: Ukraine

Russia has launched some 1,200 cruise missiles since its invasion began, but 59 percent of them did not explode, were shot down or missed, Ukraine’s General Staff of the Armed Forces has said.

“Russia shot about 1,200 missiles, less than a half hit the target,” it said on Telegram.

“Others were either shot down by air defence forces, or hit wrong targets – mountains, forests, rivers,” it added. “They have imprecise missiles and crooked hands.”

Legislation removing “most-favoured-nation” trade status for Russia has been delayed in the US Senate at least until next week, after some Republicans raised concerns that its human rights provisions might be too broad.

It is expected to pass next week, although the delay stymied efforts by Biden’s fellow Democrats to pass it in time for his meetings on Thursday with allies in Europe.

Russia’s Daniil Medvedev shrugs off Wimbledon ban threat

Tennis star Daniil Medvedev has shrugged off the possibility of being barred from this year’s Wimbledon after the status of Russian players at the tournament was called into question by the UK government.

British Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston told a parliamentary hearing last week the government could require Medvedev to provide assurances he did not support Putin before being allowed to compete at Wimbledon.

“Don’t have any response to Wimbledon,” Medvedev said. “I will need to see what happens next. I try to take it tournament by tournament. I mean, there are always different rules, regulations in order to play or not to play.”

G7 backs ICC probe into war crimes in Ukraine

The G7 countries – Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US – have backed the International Criminal Court’s probe into possible war crimes in Ukraine, saying they are “appalled” by Russian attacks on Ukrainian towns and cities.

“We will work together to support the gathering of evidence of war crimes,” the G7 said in a joint statement.

“The siege of Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities, and the denial of humanitarian access by Russian military forces are unacceptable. Russian forces must immediately provide for safe pathways to other parts of Ukraine, as well as humanitarian aid to be delivered to Mariupol and other besieged cities.”

Biden renews warnings to China against aiding Russia in Ukraine

Biden has reiterated his warnings to China against coming to Russia’s aid in Ukraine, saying he made clear “the consequences” of such assistance to Chinese President Xi Jinping during a phone call last week.

The US president said Xi understand that China’s economic interests are with the West, not Russia, he said.

“I made no threats, but I pointed out the number of American and foreign corporations who left Russia as a consequence of their barbaric behaviour,” Biden told reporters of his conversation with Xi.

European Union leaders are considering whether to impose an oil embargo on Russia over its invasion in Ukraine.

MOSCOW - European Union (EU) leaders are considering whether to impose an oil embargo on Russia over its invasion in Ukraine.

The discussions come ahead of a visit on Thursday by US President Joe Biden to European shores.

Ukrainian President Vladymir Zelensky is pushing for the embargo despite warnings that it could lead to an increase in global fuel prices.

Already, the United Nations has expressed concern over an international food crisis following the war in Ukraine.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has flagged a famine risk in Africa and the Middle East as the Ukraine war hits supplies.

“If you think we’ve got hell on Earth now, you just get ready,” warned UN food chief David Beasley.

He said northern Africa and the Middle East would be worst hit.

Economic conditions in those parts of the world are worse now than they were in the run-up to the Arab Spring more than a decade ago.

Greece also sounded the alarm that it and the EU should brace for a shortage in grain that would significantly increase prices and lead to unrest.

It comes as the US and European countries get ready to impose a fifth round of sanctions on Russia.",https://ewn.co.za/2022/03/23/eu-consider-oil-embargo-on-russia-over-invasion-in-ukraine
