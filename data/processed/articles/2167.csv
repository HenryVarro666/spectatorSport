Its pilots and air defenses have prevented Russian fighter jets from conquering the skies. And a band of savvy Ukrainian cyberwarriors are so far beating Moscow in an information war, inspiring support at home and abroad.

To the surprise of many military analysts, Ukrainian troops are mounting a stiffer-than-expected resistance to Russian forces up and down battle lines across a country the size of Texas, fighting with a resourcefulness and creativity that U.S. analysts said could trip up Russian troops for weeks or months to come.

The Ukrainians are also exploiting a bungled beginning to Russia’s all-out assault. Armed with shoulder-fired anti-tank weapons, they have attacked a mileslong Russian armored convoy bearing down on Kyiv, the capital, helping stall an advance plagued by fuel and food shortages, and stretching a march that was expected to take a handful of days into possibly weeks.

To be sure, Russia’s invasion is only a week old. The strategic southern city of Kherson fell on Wednesday; the Kremlin’s army has intensified its bombardment of Kyiv and other cities; and, despite a flow of fresh arms pouring in from the West, Ukrainian leaders say they desperately need more weapons to destroy Russian tanks and down Russian warplanes.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/03/us/politics/russia-ukraine-military.html

“Allies utterly condemned the horrific murders of civilians we have seen in Bucha and other places recently liberated from Russian control,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said following the meeting. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba thanked NATO Allies for their substantial support. “Allies have been doing a lot, and are determined to do more, now, and for the medium and longer term to help the brave Ukrainians defend their homes and their country, and push back the invading forces,” Mr Stoltenberg said.

Ministers also agreed to step up practical support to other partners at threat of Russian aggression, including Georgia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, to help strengthen their resilience. Allied Foreign Ministers were joined by their counterparts from Ukraine, Georgia, Finland, Sweden, and the European Union, and by NATO’s Asia-Pacific partners, Australia, Japan, New Zealand and the Republic of Korea. NATO will increase its cooperation with Asia-Pacific partners in areas like cyber, new technologies, disinformation, maritime security, climate change, and resilience, “because global challenges demand global solutions,” Mr Stoltenberg added.

Ministers agreed that NATO’s next Strategic Concept, which will be finalised at the Madrid Summit in June, must take account of NATO’s future relations with Russia, and China’s growing influence on Allied security. Ministers also approved the Charter for a new Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA), including a network of innovation hubs, accelerator sites and tests centres across Europe and North America.",https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_194319.htm

Khan was ending his two-day visit to Moscow hours after Russia began a military operation in Ukraine.nPakistani government officials have offered few details on the substance of Khan's visit, which was planned more than a month ago and was expected to focus on Pakistan's energy needs. It was the first visit to Moscow by a Pakistani leader in more than 20 years. Khan was to have met with Putin following his arrival on Wednesday, though the foreign ministry has not spoken of it.nKhan’s decision to still go ahead with the visit despite growing fears of a Russian invasion of Ukraine surprised some analysts. In recent years Pakistan has grown closer to Russia, which has traditional ties with Islamabad’s long-time foe and neighbour India. Russia and Pakistan have shared military exercises and grown closer as peace was sought to the relentless conflict in Afghanistan.n""},{""@type"":""BlogPosting"",""headline"":""France's Macron to address the nation over Russia attack on Ukraine: Presidency"",""url"":""https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-news-live-updates-civilians-soldiers-killed-eu-canada-us-uk-sansactions-putin-russia-ukraine-war-indians-in-ukraine-25th-february-2022-761440#blogDiv64083"",""datePublished"":""2022-02-24T17:25:13+05:30"",""mainEntityofPage"":""https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-news-live-updates-civilians-soldiers-killed-eu-canada-us-uk-sansactions-putin-russia-ukraine-war-indians-in-ukraine-25th-february-2022-761440"",""image"":{""@type"":""ImageObject"",""contentUrl"":""https://resize1.indiatvnews.com/en/centered/newbucket/1200_675/2022/02/ap22055772887633-1645752123.jpg"",""width"":1200,""height"":675,""url"":""https://resize1.indiatvnews.com/en/centered/newbucket/1200_675/2022/02/ap22055772887633-1645752123.jpg""},""publisher"":{""@type"":""Organization"",""name"":""India TV"",""logo"":{""@type"":""ImageObject"",""url"":""https://static.indiatvnews.com/ins-web/images/sitelogo.png"",""width"":600,""height"":60}},""author"":{""@type"":""Organization"",""sameAs"":""https://www.indiatvnews.com/"",""name"":""India TV News Desk""},""dateModified"":""2022-02-24T17:25:13+05:30"",""articleBody"":""France's Macron to address the nation over Russia attack on Ukraine, says presidency.
