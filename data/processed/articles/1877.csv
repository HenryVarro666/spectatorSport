RIGA, Latvia — Russia accused Ukraine on Friday of escalating their war by carrying out a helicopter attack against a fuel depot in the Russian city of Belgorod, in what appeared to be Ukraine’s first airstrike on Russian soil since the invasion began. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said President Vladimir Putin had been informed about the incident. He said it was “certainly” an escalation, adding, “This is not something that can be perceived as creating conditions comfortable for the continuation of negotiations.”

Ukrainian officials would not confirm or deny the attack, suggesting that it could be a Russian error or even linked to Russian helicopter pilots who had refused to fly into Ukraine. These officials suggested that Moscow should sort out what was happening on its own territory.

Despite this apparent trolling, many military and intelligence analysts said it had been a Ukrainian attack carried out by two Mi-24 helicopters that swept in low; fired rockets at the fuel depot, causing a massive explosion and igniting fuel tank fires; and then departed, still flying at a very low altitude. No casualties were reported.

If the attack is confirmed, it would mark an audacious and risky move by Ukraine, with its forces shifting from a largely defensive posture to a direct airstrike on Russia at a time when the Russian military appears weakened.

Videos of the attack taken from several angles swiftly surfaced on Russian social media, and local governor Vyacheslav Gladkov immediately blamed Ukraine for the strike.

Russian defense ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said the attack happened at about 5 a.m. He said the fuel depot, not far from the border with Ukraine, was a facility that provided fuel for civilian transportation and was not used for military vehicles involved in the war.

“Ukrainian helicopters delivered a missile strike upon a civilian oil storage terminal located on the outskirts of Belgorod,” he told a briefing. “A number of tanks were damaged and caught fire after being hit by missiles.” He added, “The oil terminal has no relation to the Russian armed forces.”

But the British Defense Ministry said in its daily intelligence briefing that the fires at the fuel depot, coupled with explosions earlier in the week at an ammunition depot near Belgorod, could affect the Russian war effort and “will likely add additional short-term strain to Russia’s already stretched logistics chains.” The ministry said that Russian forces encircling Ukraine’s second-largest city Kharkiv, about 40 miles from Belgorod, “may be particularly affected.”

The incident, which occurred as Russian troops are pulling back from several areas of Ukraine, is deeply embarrassing for Russian forces after their poor performance in the war. The Russian campaign was expected to take days but has dragged on, with huge losses of troops and material. Russian military officials have frequently asserted that Ukraine’s air force is almost destroyed.

While acknowledging an attack, Peskov asserted that Russia’s control over its own airspace was not in doubt. “Air superiority in the operation is an absolute fact, it really is. As for what happened, it is up to our law enforcement agencies, not us, to make assessments.”

Hard-line Russian state television anchor Vladimir Solovyov appeared furious about the attack. “Who is responsible for the air defense in the Belgorod direction?” he demanded on his Telegram channel. “Are the locations of the strike helicopters destroyed? When will the security zone for the Belgorod region be established?”

The attack came after Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Tuesday that Ukraine’s air force and air defense network had been “practically destroyed,” adding that “air superiority has been achieved.” He said Russia had accomplished its main goals, including degrading Ukraine’s military.

Rob Lee, of King’s College London’s war studies department, said the attack, most likely carried out by Ukraine, dealt Russia a propaganda blow.

“Shoigu said the war is going well. And days later they do this helicopter attack in Russia proper, this brazen, bold attack, and it’s embarrassing,” Lee said. “It helps break the propaganda being pushed in Russia.”

By striking across the border, Ukrainian forces would be putting the lie to Russian news coverage that says the campaign is going according to plan, Lee said. “But here’s very clear and undeniable proof that the war is not going to plan, that the Ukrainian military is not destroyed, and the Ukrainian air force can still do operations in Russia more than a month into the war.”

When Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba was asked about the allegations of Ukrainian involvement, he said he could not confirm or deny the claim because he did not have all the relevant military information.

Ukraine military spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk said Ukraine did not bear responsibility for catastrophes and mistakes in Russia. He declined to confirm or deny Ukrainian involvement but said it was not the first time Russia had made such accusations.

Ukraine’s operation is defensive, “to resist Russia’s military aggression in the territory of Ukraine,” Motuzyanyk added.

After Russia invaded on Feb. 24, Ukrainian forces initially mounted a defense focused on Kyiv and other major cities, and in recent days have been retaking settlements near the capital and along the front lines.

Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych also insisted that Ukraine was focused on defending itself.

“Maybe someone smoked in the wrong place” and caused the Belgorod fire, he said. “Maybe it was an act by some soldiers who don’t want to fight in Ukraine. Everything that happens on Russian territory is the responsibility of the Russian leadership. All questions to them.”

Lee said this was probably not Ukraine’s first attack on Russian soil. Ukraine has probably fired Tochka-U missiles into Russian territory on several occasions during the war. He dismissed speculation that the helicopter attack may have been a Russian false flag, arguing that Moscow no longer needs to create a pretext for war.

After the Belgorod ammunition depot was rocked by explosions earlier this week, Russian media initially said the blasts appeared to have been caused by firing from the Ukrainian side, but officials later blamed the explosions on a fire on the premises. Lee said it may have been caused by a missile from Ukraine.

The latest incident risks undermining progress in talks between the two sides aimed at reaching a peace deal — now at a delicate stage — after Ukraine offered concessions to Russia on Tuesday in return for a military withdrawal.

Russian negotiators announced Tuesday that Moscow’s forces would de-escalate their combat operations near Kyiv and Chernihiv to “build trust,” focusing their fight on eastern Ukraine. The announcement caused outrage among prominent hard-line state television presenters and pundits, and on social media.

But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he did not trust Russia’s announcement of a de-escalation, telling Ukrainians in one of his regular addresses Thursday, “We don’t believe anyone, not a single beautiful phrase.” U.S. officials have also been skeptical of Moscow’s announcement, seeing it as a sign that Russia is probably taking time to regroup and reorganize its attack.

Investigative journalists from the Conflict Intelligence Team, a Russian independent investigative media outlet, say that the missile that was allegedly launched from the territory of Ukraine and which landed near Belgorod, was launched from the northeast – meaning that it was launched from the territory of the Russian Federation.

Source: Conflict Intelligence Team

According to CIT: ""We have managed to geolocate the location from which the missile strike was recorded. It turned out that the camera was pointing to the southeast, and the missile appears to be travelling from left to right, meaning from the east or the northeast and, therefore, from the territory of Russia.

The size of the funnel suggests that it was created by a cruise or ballistic missile. We do not know of instances of use of cruise missiles by the Ukrainian side in this conflict. Moreover, a Ukrainian ballistic missile would have arrived from the Ukrainian positions, that is, from the west or southwest.

In addition, according to Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov of Belgorod, a similar incident took place at the same time near [the village of] Yasnye Zori in the Belgorod region. Given that the village would be along the missile’s trajectory if it was launched from Nikolskoye, it is possible that this incident is related to the Belgorod strike.

We cannot unequivocally say whether the incident was caused by something that derailed the rocket from its trajectory, or an aiming error. Given that this event has barely been covered in the Russian state media, this launch of a missile from Russian territory is unlikely to have been a deliberate Russian provocation done in order to accuse Ukraine.

One way or another, unlike the attack on the fuel depot (and possibly some other facilities), we are ready to rule out Ukraine’s involvement in this incident.""

Ukraine neither confirms nor denies reports of Ukrainian implication in the fuel storage facility fire, Ukrainian Defense Ministry spokesman Olexandr Motuzyanyk said.

Motuzyanyk said Ukraine has been conducting a defensive operation to roll back the Russian military operation in Ukraine, launched in late February. In this respect, he said that ""this does not mean that Ukraine should be responsible for all miscalculations, all catastrophes, and all the events taking place in Russia.""

Moscow, for its part, claimed that such an attack was detrimental to the future of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the alleged Ukrainian helicopter attack on the oil facility located in Russian territory would not be helpful for future peace negotiations with Kiev.

The governor of the Belgorod region said that the fire at the oil depot resulted from an air raid conducted by two helicopters of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which entered Russian airspace at a low altitude.

2-Ukrainian MI-24 attack helicopters reportedly slipped across the border and fired on an oil depot in the city of Belgorod, injuring 2-people.

It’s the first airstrike that Russia has reported on its territory since the start of the war.

The governor said that there was no danger to civilians and that all emergency services were on the scene. He also said that two oil depot workers had been injured in the fire, but the injuries were not life-threatening, Gladkov added.

The Russian Defense Ministry has not made any public comment on the incident. Likewise, the Ukrainian General Staff did not make any comment on the accusations, denying either to confirm or refuse such claims.

Conflict Intelligence Team, an open source investigative journalism blog based in Ukraine, says that local media in Belgorod, Russia, has been reporting that craters in the area were caused by Ukrainian missiles.

The photos of the craters were geolocated by the group and verified to be near the west Russian city and had come from the north-east, which indicates it came from Russian territory.

Conflict Intelligence Team claim that the craters of that size were more likely caused by misfiring Russian cruise missiles fired from the north-east of Belgorod - which is Russian territory

The photos of the craters were geolocated by the group and verified to be near the west Russian city and had come from the north-east, which indicates it came from Russian territory

The collective identified the crater as more likely to have come from a Russian 9M728 cruise missile from a Russian Iskander-M launcher

The size of the crater implied that the damage to the terrain had come from cruise missiles - a weapon which Ukraine has not used in the conflict thus far.

The collective identified the crater as more likely to have come from a Russian 9M728 cruise missile from a Russian Iskander-M launcher.

However, this is unconfirmed with Russia unlikely to have fired a nuclear capable ballistic missile on its own soil.

The group concluded that the most likely scenario was the crater was caused by the latest military equipment failure from Russian forces which was then opportunistically used to blame Ukraine.

The latest claims come after the first reported attack by Ukraine on Russian soil as two helicopters were filmed attacking the Roseneft fuel depot, also in Belgorod.

Regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said two of Ukraine's military helicopters flew 25 miles undetected past the Russian border at low altitude to Belgorod yesterday where they fired S-8 rockets at a Roseneft depot, causing a huge fireball to break out.

Two people were injured in the Belgorod facility blaze, the Russian governor said, but they were expected to survive

The oil facility is only 25 miles from the border with Ukraine, and was ablaze on Friday morning

Firefighters try to tackle the huge blaze at the oil depot this morning as plumes of black smoke billow from the site

But some have theorised that this could be a false-flag attack in order to justify escalation of the conflict or a Russian withdrawal from peace talks.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: 'Of course, this is not something that can be perceived as creating comfortable conditions for the continuation of negotiations.'

Ukraine foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said: 'I can neither confirm nor reject the claim that Ukraine was involved in this simply because I do not possess all the military information.'

Gladkov, who was appointed by Vladimir Putin in 2020. said the air strike, which would be the first on Russian soil since WWII, injured two workers and parts of the city have been evacuated.

Photos on social media appeared to show the oil facility in Belgorod ablaze in the early hours of Friday

Video shared on social media appeared to show the attack happening at 5.43am local time, followed by helicopters flying away from the blaze, although analysts have noted Russia uses the same time of helicopters as Ukraine.

Ukraine's government is yet to confirm the incident but if true, it would be the second time Ukraine has ventured past the border since the invasion following the alleged long-range missile attack on Millerovo airbase last month, in the latest humiliation for Putin in his flailing campaign.

But last week, an exiled Russian politician claimed the Kremlin is plotting a wave of attacks on its own cities in a false flag operation led by the FSB that it will blame on Ukraine to justify a general mobilisation of troops.

There was no independent confirmation of details about the incident.

Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said two Ukrainian Mi-24 helicopters had entered Russian airspace “at an extremely low altitude” and attacked the civilian oil storage facility on the outskirts of the city of Belgorod.

He said the facility was supplying petroleum “to civilian transport only. The oil base has nothing to do with Russian armed forces.”

Regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said two workers at the depot were injured, he said. But Russian media cited a statement from state oil company Rosneft that denied anyone was hurt.

More than 300 firefighters battled the blaze, using a helicopter and a special firefighting train, the Belgorod mayor’s office said. Gladkov said he met with residents who were moved from their homes to a nearby sports facility. He also posted photos of craters and metal fragments in a rural area where he said explosions had damaged a power line and broken a window.

It would not be the first attack reported inside Russia since the war began Feb. 24, although there has been nothing as dramatic.

Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s national security council, denied Ukraine was responsible.

“For some reason, they say that we did it, but in fact this does not correspond with reality,” he said on Ukrainian television.

Earlier, presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovich said: “We are carrying out defensive operations on our territory. Russian authorities bear responsibility for everything that happens at Russian territory.”

Russian authorities “must figure out what’s going on in Belgorod,” he said. “Maybe someone smoked in the wrong place. Maybe there was something else. Maybe Russian troops are sabotaging orders and don’t want to enter Ukrainian territory by available means.”

Any airborne attack inside Russia would likely require skillful flying to avoid its air defenses.

The explosion drew a muted response from the Kremlin, with spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying it was not helpful for talks with Ukraine.

On Russian social media, some users expressed surprise that Ukraine was still capable of mounting such an attack or getting past Russian air defenses. Russia’s daily video briefings from the Defense Ministry often stress the number of Ukrainian planes and helicopters shot down or destroyed.

Belgorod is about 25 kilometers (16 miles) from the border and is roughly opposite Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city that which has been under Russian bombardment since the early stages of the war.

Earlier incidents in the Belgorod region had caused alarm locally but had little wider resonance in the context of the war, which Russia portrays as a “special military operation” with little effect on the lives of ordinary citizens.

On the first day of the war, three people were reported injured from shelling in Belgorod, although there was no independent confirmation. A statement from Russia’s state Investigative Committee said two adults and one child were injured, and an attempted murder probe was launched.

Another criminal investigation by the committee was opened March 1 after a report that two Ukrainian missiles from an Uragan launcher had landed in a rural area. That report also was not independently confirmed.

Gladkov said last week that a shell fired from Ukraine had exploded in a village in the Belgorod region in an incident in which the Russian Orthodox Church said had killed a military chaplain. A similar incident was reported to have damaged houses. There was no independent confirmation of those reports.

Other explosions March 29 were due to what Gladkov said he had heard was a fire at a munitions store in the border village of Krasny Oktyabr, citing “unverified information.” Ukraine was not blamed for the incident and Gladkov said he was awaiting official comment from the Defense Ministry, although none followed and the cause of the fire remained unclear.

The alleged airstrike occurred in Belgorod, Russia, just 25 miles from the Ukrainian border. Videos on social media reportedly of the attack show helicopters firing missiles toward the ground followed by an explosion. Eight of the 16 fuel tanks at the facility, owned by Russian oil company Rosneft, are on fire, according to Russian media. The alleged attack comes two days after a Ukrainian official told the Washington Examiner that his country has the right to attack targets inside Russian territory.

Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of the Belgorod region, said that two Ukrainian armed forces helicopters entered Russian territory at low altitude on Friday to conduct the airstrike, according to Russian media reports.

Several alleged videos of the attack posted on social media show missiles striking a target on the ground and two helicopters flying near the blast.

City officials are evacuating residents in the vicinity of the fire.
