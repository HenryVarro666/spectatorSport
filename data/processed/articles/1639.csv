US to move troops and aircraft to Eastern Europe

US armed forces are moving aircraft and soldiers to Eastern Europe, Defense Department spokesperson John Kirby said on Tuesday.

This includes a unit of around 200 marines which has been moved to Lithuania from Norway, Kirby said.

Ten F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets and a few C-130 Hercules transport planes, as well as some 200 associated soldiers, will be brought to Eastern Europe from the US. Kirby said that they would be moved shortly but that their precise destination remained unclear.

US says some Russian troops leaving Kyiv region

Following the announcement earlier on Tuesday that Russia would cut back on its military actions around Kyiv and Chernihiv, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said that the US believed some Russian troops had already left.

""Has there been some movement by some Russian units away from Kyiv in the last day or so? Yes, we think so. Small numbers,"" Kirby told reporters.

""But we believe that this is a repositioning, not a real withdrawal, and that we all should be prepared to watch for a major offensive against other areas of Ukraine. It does not mean that the threat to Kyiv is over,"" he added.

Biden voices skepticism over Russia's pledge to cut activities

US President Joe Biden said he wasn't convinced that Russia's promise to cut back military operations around Kyiv will lead to a significant change in the conflict.

""We'll see if they follow through,"" he told reporters after holding a phone call with the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Italy.

""There seems to be a consensus that let's just see what they have to offer.""

Russian negotiators pledged to scale back hostilities near Kyiv and the city of Chernihiv during talks with Ukraine in Turkey on Tuesday.

France says no Mariupol humanitarian mission possible 'at this stage'

The conditions for carrying out a humanitarian operation sought by France to help civilians in the besieged port city of Mariupol have not been met ""at this stage,"" French President Emmanuel Macron's office said.

The French leader spoke to his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in a phone call on Tuesday.

Macron had outlined the mission sought alongside Turkey and Greece to Putin, who said ""he was going to think about it"" before responding, an Elysee Palace official said.

Mariupol has been one of the worst struck cities since the start of the Ukraine war with the local mayor saying it is now ""on the brink of humanitarian catastrophe.""

Watch video 01:44 Mariupol on 'brink of humanitarian catastrophe'

The Russian president also told Macron that Ukrainian ""nationalists"" in besieged Mariupol must lay down their arms.

""It was stressed that in order to resolve the difficult humanitarian situation in this city (Mariupol), Ukrainian nationalist militants must stop resisting and lay down their arms,"" the Kremlin said in a statement about the call.

The two presidents also discussed Russia's decision to request payments in rubles for Russian gas supplies to the EU, the statement added.

Russia-backed Donetsk considers joining Russia

The head of the so-called Donetsk People's Republic — a part of Ukraine controlled by Russian-backed separatists since 2014 — has said the region will consider joining Russia, according to the Donetsk News Agency.

""As for joining the Russian Federation, as for this wish and drive, they have been obvious since 2014 — the wish to be in Russia,"" Denis Pushilin said.

Moscow recognized the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics on February 24, just days before Russian troops invaded Ukraine.

Pushilin's comments come two days after Russian-backed rebels in Luhansk said they may hold a referendum on joining Russia. Kyiv said such a move would not have legal basis and warned of an international response.

Snake Island soldier receives medal

The Ukrainian soldier, whose comments to a Russian warship went viral, has returned home.

Roman Hrybov was taken prisoner by Russian forces while he was serving on the so-called Snake Island (Zmiinyi Island in Ukrainian), a small island in the Black Sea.

A recording of Hrybov telling a Russian warship to ""go f*** yourself"" went viral.

The Ukrainian troops stationed on the island were at first presumed to have been killed in an attack. It later turned out they had been taken captive and were exchanged for Russian prisoners.

The Ukrainian military shared a picture of the soldier receiving a medal on social media. They said he has returned to ""his native Cherkasy region.""

Russia files two cases against Google over banned content

Russia has filed two legal cases against Alphabet Inc, which owns Google, for failure to remove banned information from its YouTube video-sharing platform, the country's communication regulator said on Tuesday.

Roskomnadzor accused the tech giant of blatantly promoting false content about Russia's invasion, which the Kremlin calls a ""special military operation.""

It said YouTube had become one of the key platforms in the ""information war"" against Moscow.

The regulator added that Google could be fined up to 8 million rubles ($91,533; €82,500), or as much as 20% of the company's annual revenue in Russia for repeat offenses.

Russia has blocked Google News and restricted access to Twitter, Facebook and Instagram

US skeptical of Russian gestures

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken questioned the seriousness of Russia's claims of progress at the Ukraine-Russia talks in Turkey on Tuesday.

""I've not seen anything to suggest that this is moving forward in an effective way because we have not seen signs of real seriousness"" from Russia, Blinken said during an official visit to Morocco.

""There is what Russia says and there is what Russia does. We're focussed on the latter,"" he added.

""If they somehow believe that an effort to subjugate ""only,"" in quotation marks, the eastern part of Ukraine and the southern part of Ukraine can succeed, then once again they are profoundly fooling themselves,"" CNN quoted Blinken as saying.

He once again called on Russia to end the fighting and said the Ukrainians were engaged in negotiations ""with a gun literally to their heads.""

'De-escalation is not a cease-fire'

Following the announcement that Russia would decrease its military activities around Kyiv and Chernihiv, Russian lead negotiator Vladimir Medinsky clarified that this did not amount to a cease-fire.

""This is not a cease-fire but this is our aspiration, gradually to reach a de-escalation of the conflict at least on these fronts,"" Medinsky told TASS news agency.

He went on to say that talks between the two sides ""still have a long way to go.""

UK calls for 'complete withdrawal' of Russian troops from Ukraine

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a full withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine, his spokesperson said.

Asked about Russia's promise to scale back their armed forces around the cities of Kyiv and Chernihiv, the spokesman said: ""We will judge [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and his regime by his actions, not by his words.""

""There has been some reduction in Russian bombardment around Kyiv, largely because Ukrainian forces have been successfully pushing back the Russian offensives in the northwest of the city,"" he told reporters.

""But fighting continues. There's heavy bombardment in Mariupol and other areas. So we don't want to see anything less than a complete withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukrainian territory.""

Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland expel dozens of Russian diplomats

Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra said the Netherlands has expelled 17 Russian ""intelligence officers"" who were ""undercover as diplomats.""

""These intelligence officers are a threat to the security of [the Netherlands],"" Hoekstra wrote on Twitter.

""Experience shows that Russia does not leave such measures unanswered. We cannot speculate on that, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is prepared for various scenarios that may occur in the near future,"" he said in a statement.

Shortly after the Dutch announcement, Belgian Foreign Minister Sophie Wilmes said Belgium was also expelling 21 Russian diplomats for actions related to espionage or unlawful influence peddling.

Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney later said Ireland was expelling four Russian diplomats whose activities have not been ""in accordance with international standards of diplomatic behavior.""

Poland approves law to ban Russian coal imports

Polish government spokesman Piotr Muller said the Cabinet has adopted draft legislation that will allow a ban on imports of Russian coal.

""We don't want these imports to be possible any longer, although we realize that there's a risk related to the fact that the European Union has not approved such actions to date,"" Muller told reporters in Warsaw.

Generally, the whole EU has to agree on sanctions imposed in the bloc, and Brussels could potentially punish members states acting unilaterally.

Russian representatives not welcome at Buchenwald commemoration

German officials have told Russian and Belarusian diplomatic representatives that they are not welcome at the commemoration for the 77th anniversary of the liberation of the Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora Nazi concentration camps.

""We have informed the consular representations in writing that they are not welcome at the events,"" director of the Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora Memorials Foundation, Jens-Christian Wagner, said on Tuesday.

One reason for the move was the death of the 96-year-old Buchenwald camp survivor Boris Romanchenko.

Romanchenko, who had previously served as vice-president for the international committee of survivors for the two camps, was killed by Russian bombardments in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv in mid-March.

The Nazi camps were liberated by US troops on April 11, 1945, shortly before the end of the Second World War.

UK detains Russian-owned superyacht

Britain has detained a Russian-owned superyacht in what it called a ""warning"" to Moscow of the consequences of invading Ukraine.

Phi is a 58.5-meter (192-foot) vessel worth $50 million (€45 million), boasting a fresh-water swimming pool. It was docked at Canary Wharf in London.

The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) said the ship is registered to a company based in the Caribbean country of St Kitts and Nevis and sails under a Maltese flag.

""The ownership of the yacht was deliberately well-hidden,"" the agency said in a statement, adding that it had ultimately uncovered that its owner was a Russian businessman.

Amnesty International accuses Russia of war crimes in Ukraine

Agnes Callamard, secretary-general of the human rights organization, told DW that Amnesty has been ""documenting an escalation of human rights and humanitarian law violations, including the indiscriminate or deliberate targeting of civilians.""

""Russia's crackdown on freedom of speech started before the aggression against Ukraine,"" Callamard said. She pointed to ""the shrinking space for independent media and dissenting voices,"" which she said goes back to at least 2021.

She added that disinformation and propaganda are part of the war, making it difficult to keep track of what is actually going on.

Watch video 06:52 Human rights in 2021: Amnesty's Callamard speaks with DW

Callamard also insisted that ""the standards that are applied to … Ukrainian refugees are applied across the board to others.""

""As we speak right now, there are refugees stuck between Belarus and Poland who are denied entry into Poland,"" she added, saying that the failure to support those refugees mean that the west was ""losing a war of values.""

She added that as an outcome of the war, many countries will experience food shortages and skyrocketing prices, exacerbated by the failures of governments to ""build back better"" after the coronavirus pandemic. ""That is the betrayal of 2021,"" she told DW.

UNHCR: More than 3.9 people fled Ukraine

The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said 3,901,713 people have fled the war in Ukraine — an increase of 38,916 from Monday's figure.

UNHCR spokesman Matthew Saltmarsh told reporters that the number of refugees was ""unprecedented since World War II in Europe, certainly in terms of the speed and scale of the displacement.""

Francesco Rocca, the president of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), said refugees were arriving exhausted and feeling ""hopeless.""

""We are seeing millions of people arriving at borders, their coping capacities stretched by what they have experienced and witnessed,"" he said.

""People are understandably tired and stressed, physically, mentally and emotionally.""

Russia expels 10 diplomats from the Baltic states

Russia's Foreign Ministry said Moscow has expelled 10 diplomats from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in a tit-for-tat response to the Baltic states' recent expulsion of 10 Russian diplomats.

The Baltic states had said they expelled Russian diplomats as they had been carrying out activities that were ""incompatible with their diplomatic status."" They said the move was also in solidarity with Ukraine.

Russia-Ukraine talks conclude in Istanbul

Ukrainian and Russian negotiators concluded face-to-face peace talks in Istanbul on Tuesday, with the Ukrainian side saying that there have been enough developments to have a meeting between the presidents of the two countries.

Russia said the talks were ""constructive,"" raising hopes that there could be progress toward ending the war.

However, Russian top negotiator Medinsky said a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy is possible only if a deal has been approved by the foreign ministries of both countries.

Following the talks, Ukrainian negotiators told reporters that Kyiv would agree to a neutral status if a security guarantee system is put in place. They said, under the new system, Israel, Poland, Canada and Turkey could be among Ukraine’s security guarantors.

The neutral status would include not hosting any foreign military bases on Ukrainian territory.

There needs to be full peace across Ukraine for any final agreement with Russia to come into force, the Ukrainian side stressed, adding that a referendum would be needed in Ukraine on the terms of any final deal.

They also proposed holding consultations with Russia on the status of Crimea.

The talks on Tuesday lasted around four hours with occasional breaks. It is unclear if the discussions will continue for a second day.

Russia says rules for gas payments in rubles will be ready in days

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was working out practical arrangements for foreign companies and governments to pay for Russian gas in rubles.

Peskov said the plan would be ready by Thursday, in line with Russian President Vladimir Putin's set deadline.

""No one will supply gas for free, it is simply impossible, and you can pay for it only in rubles,"" Peskov told reporters on Tuesday.

He added that ""all modalities are being developed so that this system is simple, understandable and feasible for respected European and international buyers.""

Peskov's remarks came a day after Germany said the G7 nations rejected Putin's demand to pay for Russian gas in rubles. Berlin said the demand was a breach of the pre-agreed terms and conditions.

Russia says the military's main task is now to 'liberate' Donbas

Russia's defense minister Sergei Shoigu said on Tuesday that Ukraine's military capacity had been seriously degraded, the Interfax news agency reported. ""The combat potential of the Ukrainian armed forces has been significantly reduced, which makes it possible to focus the main attention and main efforts on achieving the main goal — the liberation of Donbas.""

Shoigu's assertion came despite Ukraine's unexpectedly strong resistance since the war began last month, which has seen Russia fail to take any major cities, and stall in advancing along multiple fronts.

However, Shoigu reiterated statements made last week by officials that the Russian military had completed the main objective of the first phase of its invasion.

The minister also stressed the change in Russia's war aims, underlining that the main task of the Russian military is now to ""liberate"" Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, part of which has been under the control of Russian proxies since 2014.

Furthermore, he warned the West that Moscow will respond appropriately if NATO supplies fighter aircraft and air defense systems to Ukraine.

US to deploy fighter jets to Germany to boost NATO posture

The United States is deploying six Navy EA-18G Growler aircraft to the Spangdahlem airbase in Germany to bolster NATO's defense posture, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said.

This is ""to bolster readiness and NATO's collective defense posture and further increase air integration capabilities with our Allied and partner nations,"" he said during a conference call.

Kirby stressed that the aircraft were not intended to be used against the Russian military in Ukraine, but were intended to strengthen NATO's eastern flank and serve as a deterrent against Russia.

Kirby added that some 240 Navy personnel, consisting of pilots and maintenance crew, will also be stationed to maintain the aircraft.

The aircraft, developed by the US firm Boeing, are used in electronic warfare to counter adversaries by offering tactical jamming capabilities besides offering land and naval defense.

""The restrictions have been in place for roughly a month, a little bit over a month, and we certainly haven't seen any indication that there's non-compliance, in fact, we've seen the reverse,"" he said.

""I think there's also a fair amount of additional self-sanctioning, if you will, by multinational companies operating in Russia,"" the official added.

March 29 (Reuters) - Russia said on Tuesday it would sharply scale back military activity around Ukraine's capital Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv, in the most tangible sign yet of progress towards a peace deal.

Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin gave the undertaking after talks between delegations from the two countries in Istanbul.

""In order to increase mutual trust and create the necessary conditions for further negotiations and achieving the ultimate goal of agreeing and signing (an) agreement, a decision was made to radically, by a large margin, reduce military activity in the Kyiv and Chernihiv directions,"" Fomin told reporters.

He did not refer to the eastern and southern parts of Ukraine where Russian forces are also conducting major offensives but have struggled to make headway.

Russia's chief negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, said this was one of two steps Moscow was taking to de-escalate the 34-day-old conflict.

He said the other was that Russia would agree to a meeting between presidents Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy to take place simultaneously if and when a peace treaty was initialled by their foreign ministers.

Previously, Moscow had said that a presidential meeting could only take place at a later point.

Ukrainian negotiators said they had proposed at the latest round of talks with Russia that Ukraine adopt neutral status in exchange for security guarantees, meaning Kyiv would not join military alliances or host military bases. read more

Medinsky said: ""These proposals will be considered in the near future, reported to the president (Putin), and our response will be given.""

Fomin said Russia had also called on Ukraine to eliminate what he called torture of captured Russian prisoners.

There appeared to be tangible progress, with Russia declaring that it would ""drastically reduce"" its offensive around Kyiv and another city ""to increase mutual trust"" and enable the talks to continue.

Ukrainian officials have been pushing for a ceasefire agreement to enable thousands of civilians to evacuate from besieged towns and cities that are still being bombed by Russian forces.

Russia's lead negotiator Vladimir Medinsky emerged from Tuesday's talks to say his country had received ""a clearly formulated position from Ukraine,"" and that ""the possibility of making peace will become closer"" as the two sides continue to work quickly to reach compromises.

Ukrainian negotiators also indicated some progress as the two sides seek to hammer out mutual ""security guarantees.""

David Arahamia, one of the Ukrainian negotiators, declared a ""first victory"" merely by having the venue for the negotiations moved from Belarus, a Russian ally on Ukraine's northern border, to Turkey. ""We see Turkey as one of our guarantor countries for Ukrainian safety.""

But the most significant declaration after Tuesday's talks came from Moscow, where the ministry of defense issued a statement saying it would ""reduce military activity"" in order to ""create the necessary conditions for further negotiations.""

Ukraine's leaders have made it clear since last week that they're willing to accept a formal neutral status for the country, ruling out NATO membership and accepting some constraints on its military, in exchange for an end to the war.

""Due to the fact that negotiations on the preparation of the treaty on the neutrality and non-nuclear status of Ukraine, as well as on the provision of security guarantees to Ukraine, are moving into practice, taking into account the principles discussed during today's meeting, by the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation — in order to increase mutual trust and create the necessary conditions for further negotiations and achievement of the ultimate goal… a decision was made to radically, at times, reduce military activity in the Kyiv and Chernihiv directions,"" Russia's Deputy Minister of Defense Alexander Fomin said.

It wasn't clear to what extent Russia's military would reduce its artillery barrage against Kyiv's suburbs and the decimated city of Chernihiv, close to the Russian border, but it was the first time Moscow had given any indication that it would reduce the intensity of its ""special military operation"" since it began on February 24.

Russia's defense ministry has said it will now focus its efforts on eastern Ukraine to ensure the ""independence"" of two breakaway regions held by Moscow-backed separatist fighters.

Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the round of Russia-Ukraine talks in his country had brought ""the most meaningful progress"" to date toward ending the war, but his American counterpart, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, was more cautious.

""I would leave it to our Ukrainian partners to characterize whether there is any genuine progress and whether Russia is engaging meaningfully,"" Blinken told reporters on Tuesday. ""What I can say is this: There is what Russia says, and there is what Russia does. We're focused on the latter. And what Russia is doing is the continued brutalization of Ukraine and its people. And that continues as we speak.""

While Russia's defense ministry pinned the change in tactics to the peace talks, a former Ukrainian ambassador told BBC News that, in his view, it was down to Russia being forced to accept realities on the ground.

""Maybe they realize that they are not winning this war, and they will never win,"" Ukraine's former ambassador to Austria, Dr. Olexander Scherba told the BBC after Tuesday's negotiations. ""We know what we are fighting for, Russians don't.""

CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams reports that Putin's ground forces have been stalled for weeks in their approach to Kyiv and other towns, and they're taking heavy losses. As many as 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in just over a month of fighting, according to an estimate by a NATO official.

Unable to advance due to logistical failures and stiff Ukrainian resistance, Russia has resorted to a war of attrition, pummeling cities from afar with missiles and artillery.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video address Monday evening that Russia's ""ruthless war against our nation"" had killed at least 143 children.

He lauded Ukraine's defense forces for refusing to let Russian troops take Kyiv, and said they were even pushing Putin's military out of some towns it had seized near the capital.

""Our defenders are advancing in the Kyiv region, returning control over Ukrainian territory,"" Zelenskyy said. ""The occupiers are getting pushed away from Irpin, from Kyiv. However, it is still too early to talk about security in this part of the region. The fighting continues.""

Williams and her team saw first-hand this week that advances by Ukraine's troops do not guarantee safety for the people living in towns that are reclaimed from Russia.

Williams was with Ukrainian forces as they traveled by road on Monday toward the town of Makariv, about 40 miles west of Kyiv. Ukraine said its troops recaptured Makariv last week, but as they approached, the Ukrainian forces spotted Russian drones flying overhead.

It was a tense situation. Twice the convoy left their vehicles by the side of the road and scattered for cover. The booms of shells landing could be heard nearby.

Williams said it was clear that Ukraine's fight for freedom could be long and dangerous.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-war-news-peace-talks-turkey-putin-reduce-military-activity/

UK: Some Russian forces have been forced to return to reorganize Some Russian forces that have suffered heavy losses in Ukraine have been forced to return to their own country or Belarus, but setbacks on the ground mean more mass artillery and missile strikes, the United Kingdom's defense ministry said Wednesday. The U.K. in an intelligence update said that Russia's claimed focus on eastern Ukraine is an acknowledgment that its forces are struggling. ""Russia will likely continue to compensate for its reduced ground maneuver capability through mass artillery and missile strikes,"" the U.K. defense ministry said. The United Nations human rights office has said that most of the civilian casualties it has recorded in Ukraine have been from explosive weapons that affect large areas, like heavy artillery, rockets, missiles and airstrikes. The U.N. has recorded 1,179 civilians killed, including 104 children, since Russia attacked on Feb. 24. It says the real number of civilian casualties is higher than what has been able to be reported and corroborated so far.

Video shows damage in Ukrainian city of Irpin, said to be liberated Recaptured Ukrainian city of Irpin left with destruction from Russian invasion March 30, 2022 01:05 Video from the city of Irpin on Tuesday showed the devastation in the western Kyiv suburb a day after Ukraine's president and others said the city was back under their control. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday that Ukrainian forces had freed Irpin from Russian control, more than a month after Russia attacked and invaded Ukraine in an assault that has been widely condemned as an unprovoked and unjustified attack. Ukrainian and U.S. officials were dubious Tuesday of Russia's claims that it would ""drastically"" reduce military operations around Kyiv. Defense Department press secretary John Kirby said Tuesday it is clear that Russia considered Kyiv an objective. ""We ought not be fooling, and nobody should be fooling ourselves, by the Kremlin's now-recent claim that it will now just suddenly reduce military attacks near Kyiv,"" Kirby said. Kirby said only small numbers of units have been seen moving away from the Kyiv over the last day. ""But we believe this is a repositioning, not a real withdrawal — and that we all should be prepared to watch for a major offensive against other areas of Ukraine,"" he said. ""It does not mean that the threat to Kyiv is over."" Share this -







Satellite images show apparent devastation, hunger in Mariupol Satellite images published Tuesday by a U.S. defense contractor appeared to show widespread destruction in residential areas of Mariupol, Ukraine, and the grim reality faced by thousands of hungry civilians who remained there. The images, from Colorado-based Maxar Technologies, captured what appeared to be a once-leafy neighborhood that had largely been leveled by Russian artillery shelling and airstrikes.

A Maxar satellite image shows people in line waiting outside a grocery store amid reports of extreme food and water shortages in Mariupol, Ukraine, on March 20. Satellite image (C)2022 Maxar Technologies Ukrainian officials have said for days that food and water supplies for the tens of thousands of residents who stayed behind in the strategically important city have dwindled amid relentless Russian bombardment. The officials have accused Russian forces of blocking supplies and shelling and capturing those trying to flee. NBC News has not been able to independently confirm the accounts. Russian officials have said the country’s armed forces don’t target civilians. A Kremlin readout said that In a phone call Tuesday between Russian President Vladimir Putin and French President Emmanuel Macron — who has tried to broker an evacuation from the city — Putin discussed his military’s efforts to “provide urgent humanitarian assistance” and to “ensure the safe evacuation of civilians.” “It was stressed that in order to resolve the grave humanitarian situation in this city, Ukrainian nationalist militants must stop resisting and lay down their arms,” the readout said.

Ukraine lawmakers push for more help during visit to U.S. Congress WASHINGTON — Members of the Ukrainian parliament visiting the U.S. Congress are urging their American allies to send more military supplies — air support, tanks and other equipment — to push the Russians out of their country. As the Ukrainian legislators spoke Tuesday at a Capitol Hill news conference, one of their cellphones blared with the sound of an air raid siren going off in the country back home.

U.S. troops training Ukrainian troops to use equipment in Poland U.S. officials are trying to clarify what Biden meant when he said Monday that American troops are training Ukrainian troops. White House officials denied there was formal training going on but confirmed that U.S. troops in Poland are having regular ""interactions"" with Ukrainian troops there to teach them how to use U.S. and foreign military equipment. The equipment is transiting through Poland to to Ukrainian government and the training involves mostly basic military assistance, such as communications equipment, as opposed to larger systems, officials said. U.S. troops are also helping their Ukrainian counterparts learn how to use even larger equipment, which is what Biden was referencing in his remarks, according to the officials. At a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing Tuesday, Gen. Tod Wolters, Commander of U.S. European Command and Supreme Allied Commander of Europe, said there are ""liaisons that are there that are being given advice,"" which echoed what Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said in a news conference.

25 senators demand expedited delivery of lethal aid to Ukraine In a letter to White House national security advisor Jake Sullivan, a bipartisan group of 25 senators led by Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., urged the Biden administration to rush lethal aid to Ukraine amid Russia’s ongoing war. “America’s commitments to Ukraine and to our NATO allies demand we expedite the delivery of weapons and capabilities to our allies and partners; Ukraine can win this fight if we help them win this fight,” they wrote. The senators, including members of a recent bipartisan congressional delegation to Poland and Germany, requested information that included a list of lethal and nonlethal aid provided to Ukraine along with its delivery status in addition to an inventory and assessment of equipment that could be provided to Ukraine from various sources. “The U.S. mission in Ukraine must go beyond ensuring the country merely has the means to defend itself against Russia aggression,"" they wrote. ""The strategy must deliver Ukraine necessary weapons to defend itself, counter the Russia forces’ advance, and give the Ukrainian people a chance to win this war.” Share this -







Pentagon calls Russia's Kyiv claims a 'repositioning,' not a 'retreat' A small number of Russian troops have moved, mostly northward, away from Kyiv, Defense Department spokesperson John Kirby said, but he reiterated that the U.S. views it as a ""repositioning."" “We are not prepared to call this a retreat or even a withdrawal,” Kirby said at a news conference. He said the small number of troops the Pentagon has seen moving are “not a significant chunk of the multiple battalion tactical groups Russia has around Kyiv"" and warned that the threat to the Ukrainian capital was far from over. Pentagon officials believe the movement is “likely more a repositioning to be used elsewhere in Ukraine,"" Kirby said, warning that Russia could launch a ""major offensive against other areas of Ukraine.""

We're going to continue to provide the Ukrainian military with their capacity to defend themselves, and we're going to keep a close eye on what's going on,"" he said. Share this -

Agency Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi's visit confirmed that eight of Ukraine's 15 operational nuclear reactors across four sites were operational, including some in Russian-controlled areas. Others were offline for maintenance.

Wolters, who also serves as commander of U.S. European Command, did not specify the exact number of hypersonic missiles launched.

Russian troops seen moving away from Ukraine's capital As Ukrainian troops continue to claw back territory from Russia around Kyiv, Russian soldiers appear to be adjusting their activity and shifting away from the besieged country's capital. ""We're seeing some movement of troops away from Kyiv, which could be an indication of Putin having to adjust his original plan,"" a White House official said Tuesday. ""But no one should read too much into an adjustment — should momentum build, Russia could change its plans again at any moment, or this could just be a regroup."" On Monday, a senior U.S. defense official said Russia was not making any progress, advances or effort toward Kyiv, while last week, U.S. officials said Russia's assault on the capital failed to gain traction as Ukrainian forces were able to roll back Russian troops to the east and stymie them northwest of the city.

Ukraine pushes for international agreement for security guarantees Ukrainian negotiators involved in peace talks with Russia in Istanbul on Tuesday said they want to see an international agreement under which other nations would act as guarantors of Ukraine's security. David Arahamiya, a member of Ukraine's delegation, said the Ukrainian side wanted international security guarantees that would see guarantor countries act in a similar way to NATO's Article 5, which holds that an attack against one member country should be seen as an attack against all members. He said guarantor countries could include United Nations Security Council member states, including the United States, United Kingdom, China, Russia and France, as well as other countries such as Turkey, Canada, Germany, Italy, Poland and Israel. If other countries wanted to join, they would have the opportunity, he said. Arahamiya said there would also be a clause in the agreement stating that all guarantor countries will not only refrain from denying Ukraine's accession to the European Union, but would also assist in the effort. He said the agreement would first have to be approved in a referendum by Ukrainians and then ratified by the Parliament of Ukraine and approved by guarantor countries. Share this -

ICRC calls for clear agreement for safe evacuation of residents in Mariupol, other cities The International Committee of the Red Cross called on Ukraine and Russia on Tuesday to reach a clear agreement for the safe evacuation of civilians from the besieged southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol and other places as vital supplies run out.

""Our concern is that the very intensity of the fighting is putting civilians in harm's way, the fact that in places like Mariupol civilians are not able to leave in safe conditions, there were no concrete agreements by parties to the conflict for safe evacuation of civilians, nor has there been a green light to get humanitarian aid in,"" Mardini said. Ukraine and Russia must allow the ICRC to visit captured prisoners of war, in line with the Geneva Conventions, and return the remains of people killed in the conflict, he said in an interview at ICRC headquarters in Geneva.

Ukraine calls on countries to criminalize the use of Pro-Russia 'Z' symbol Ukraine's foreign minister has called on states to criminalize the use of the ""Z"" symbol, which has been used as a way to publicly show support for Russia's invasion. “’Z’ means Russian war crimes, bombed out cities, thousands of murdered Ukrainians. Public support of this barbarism must be forbidden,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a tweet Tuesday. The original meaning of the “Z” symbol has remained something of a mystery since it was first spotted on Russian tanks.

CNN —

Russia said it would “drastically reduce” its military assault on the Ukrainian cities of Kyiv and Chernihiv after talks took place between representatives of the two nations on Tuesday that appeared to show signs of progress towards an off ramp to the conflict.

The Russian defense ministry has decided to “radically, at times, reduce military activity” in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv, deputy defense minister Alexander Fomin said, state media RIA reported. The ministry’s Telegram channel also said that Moscow would “drastically reduce military activity” in the cities.

The announcement comes after Ukrainian and Western intelligence assessments suggested in recent days that Russia’s advance on Kyiv was stalling.

Talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations in Istanbul, Turkey on Tuesday covered an array of important issues, including the future of the eastern Donbas region, the fate of Crimea, a broad alliance of security guarantors and a potential meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Fomin told reporters that the ongoing discussions regarding the “neutrality and non-nuclear status of Ukraine” had contributed to the decision. More details on the steps to reduce hostilities will follow after the Russian delegation returns from Istanbul, Fomin said in remarks carried by Russian state news agency TASS.

Despite the announcement, intense fighting continued around the suburbs of Kyiv on Tuesday afternoon, especially in the northwest and northeast of the city.

Ukraine echoed the announcement regarding the reduction in military action, saying some Russian troops were pulling back from Kyiv and Chernihiv.

“The Russian enemy did not meet the goal of its offensive operation,” the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said in an official Facebook update Tuesday, adding that “certain units” of Russia’s military were withdrawing from battlefronts in the cities.

However it warned of a “high risk” of Russian troops attacking military and civilian infrastructure. The Russian military, it claimed, was struggling to reinforce and rotate in new soldiers, due to the “refusal of personnel to participate in the so-called special operation,” and are “not able to staff even one battalion-tactical group.”

Brig. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Agency, said Russia’s operations around Kyiv had failed and it was now impossible for the Russian army to overthrow the Ukrainian government. Putin’s war is now focused on the south and the east of the country, he said.

“There is reason to believe that he is considering a ‘Korean’ scenario for Ukraine,” said Budanov. “That is, [Russian forces] will try to impose a dividing line between the unoccupied and occupied regions of our country. In fact, it is an attempt to create North and South Korea in Ukraine.”

Still, enough progress was made during Tuesday’s talks between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations to allow Putin and Zelensky to meet, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said.

Speaking in Istanbul after the talks between the two sides ended, Podolyak said there was now a “likelihood” that the two presidents may meet. “We have documents prepared now which allow the presidents to meet on a bilateral basis,” he said.

Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti, citing the Russian delegation, also reported the possibility of a meeting between Putin and Zelensky. The head of the Russian delegation, presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, called the negotiations “constructive,” RIA reported.

Podolyak also said that talks between the two parties will “continue online 24/7,” adding that Ukraine needs “clear legal wording.”

He referred to talks about the status of Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014.

“It was agreed in bilateral format to take a pause for 15 years and conduct bilateral talks on the status of these territories (Crimea and Sevastopol),” he said.

Ukraine and the West have refused to recognize the Russian annexation of the Crimean peninsula, and the pause could be a formula for taking the issue off the table for now.

Podolyak added that they had separately discussed that “no military hostilities” take place over those 15 years.

The issue of security guarantees was also discussed. Another member of the Ukrainian team, Davyd Arakhamia said, “We insist that this be an international treaty, signing all the guarantors of security, which will be ratified.” This would be comparable to NATO’s Article 5, which enshrines the principle of collective defense, he said.

Podolyak also said that both sides are still “discussing a humanitarian ceasefire,” stressing there are “many places where humanitarian corridors are needed.”

Over 3.9 million refugees have fled Ukraine since the start of the war, according to UNHCR.

Chernihiv, which lies about halfway between Kyiv and the Russian border, has endured intense shelling in recent weeks. Videos geolocated by CNN show heavy damage in civilian areas.

On Saturday, Chernihiv Mayor Vladyslav Atroshenko announced the city was surrounded by Russian forces, leaving no safe pathways in or out.

He told CNN on Tuesday that between 300 and 400 people, mostly civilians, had been killed in the last three weeks.

“We don’t have the exact figure because we can only count those who died in a hospital, but if people die from an explosion, we cannot always identify them,” Atroshenko said.

Shifting strategies

The United States also believes Russia is executing a major strategy shift and withdrawing some forces from the area around Kyiv, two senior US officials told CNN on Tuesday.

The Russian forces are now pulling back in some areas of the north to focus on gains in the south and east, the US believes. The US has already observed these movements underway, including Russian Battalion Tactical Groups (BTGs) leaving the surrounding areas around Kyiv, according to the US intelligence.

In the US view, this is not a short-term adjustment to regroup, but a longer-term move as Russia comes to grips with failure to advance in the north.

The US assesses Russia will cover their retreat with air and artillery bombardment of the capital, one of the officials said. US officials caution that Russia could always reverse again if the battle conditions allow.

Russia’s suggestion of a reduction in its military action was met with cynicism in the West.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he had not seen signs the talks between the two sides were “moving forward in an effective way.”

“There is what Russia says, and there is what Russia does. We’re focused on the latter,” Blinken said.

The UK agreed with those sentiments, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman saying on Tuesday that Britain will judge Russia by its actions rather than words and that they do not want to see anything less than a “complete withdrawal” of Russian forces from Ukrainian territory.

Meanwhile, Turkey’s Foreign Minister Mevlüt Cavusoglu said “consensus and common understanding” was reached between the opposing delegations on some issues, hailing progress made in particular on the “top priority of achieving a ceasefire as soon as possible to pave the way for a permanent political solution.”

The “trickier” issues are now to be discussed at higher levels, with a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian Foreign Ministers to “make final adjustments to the common approach,” he said.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/29/europe/russia-reduce-assault-kyiv-plan-intl/index.html
5,b1440545-323d-457c-862b-98049c339335,"['Jon Henley', 'Pjotr Sauer', 'Shaun Walker']",2022-03-29 00:00:00,"Volodymyr Zelenskiy has dismissed Russia’s pledge to drastically cut back its military activity in northern Ukraine, saying “Ukrainians are not naive people” and vowing to continue defensive military efforts.

Zelenskiy said in a video address early on Wednesday: “Ukrainians have already learned during these 34 days of invasion and over the past eight years of the war in Donbas that only a concrete result can be trusted.”

Russia’s deputy defence minister Alexander Fomin said after talks in Istanbul on Tuesday that Moscow wanted to “increase mutual trust, create the right conditions for future negotiations and reach the final aim of signing a peace deal with Ukraine”, and that the Kremlin would “radically reduce military activity in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv”.

Ukraine’s president said that while there had been “positive” signals from the latest talks, “they do not drown out the explosions of Russian shells”. “The enemy is still in our territory,” he said. “The shelling of our cities continues. Mariupol is blocked. Missile and airstrikes do not stop. This is the reality. These are the facts.”

Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces said in its latest intelligence report on Tuesday night that Russian troops continued to withdraw from the territory of Kyiv and Chernihiv but the movement is merely “a rotation of individual units” and aims to “mislead the military leadership” of Ukraine.

The scepticism echoes that of experts and western diplomats and leaders, who expressed doubts that the move was more than a ploy to dress up setbacks on the ground.

An unconvinced Joe Biden said: “We’ll see. I don’t read anything into it until I see what their actions are.”

While Moscow presented its move as a goodwill gesture, it came as Russia’s advance appeared to have stalled on several fronts, with the Kremlin’s forces thwarted by stiff Ukrainian resistance, heavy losses and logistical and tactical failings.

Having failed to seize the Ukrainian capital and force an early capitulation, Moscow said last week it was shifting its focus to expanding the territory held by pro-Russia separatists in the eastern Donbas region. The defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said hours before the talks the “main goal” was now the “liberation” of Donbas.

The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said he had not seen anything indicating that talks were progressing in a “constructive way” and suggested Russian indications of a pullback could be an attempt by Moscow to “deceive people and deflect attention”.

Speaking on a visit to Morocco, Blinken said that there was “what Russia says, and what Russia does, and we’re focused on the latter. What Russia is doing is the continued brutalisation of Ukraine.”

A spokesperson for Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, said the UK had seen signs of “some reduction” in Russian bombardment around Kyiv, but added: “We will judge Putin and his regime by his actions, not by his words … We don’t want to see anything less than a complete withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukrainian territory.”

The UK’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) said in its latest updated that “it is almost certain that the Russian offensive has failed in its objective to encircle Kyiv”. The UK defence attaché Mick Smeath in a statement: “Russian statements regarding a reduction in activity around Kyiv, and reporting indicating the withdrawal of some Russian units from these areas, may indicate Russia’s acceptance that it has now lost the initiative in the region.” He added: “It is highly likely that Russia will seek to divert combat power from the north to their offensive in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the east.”

Western officials were “very wary” about the promises, saying the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, could be temporising. “Certainly in terms of the negotiations, nothing that we have seen so far has demonstrated to us that Putin and his colleagues are particularly serious,” one said. “It’s more of a tactical exercise in playing for time.”

John Kirby, press secretary at the Pentagon, warned against “fooling ourselves” over the Kremlin’s claims. “Has there been some movement by some Russian units away from Kyiv in the last day or so? Yeah, we think so, small numbers,” he said. “But we believe that this is a repositioning, not a real withdrawal, and that we all should be prepared to watch for a major offensive against other areas of Ukraine.”

Ukraine presented Russian negotiators in Istanbul with a framework for peace under which it would remain neutral with its security guaranteed by third-party countries including the US, the UK, France, Turkey, China and Poland, in an arrangement similar to Nato’s article 5, which commits members to defend one another.

It also said it would be willing to agree to a 15-year consultation period on the status of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, with both countries agreeing not to use their militaries to resolve the issue in the meantime, and called for Russia to drop its objection to Ukrainian membership of the EU.

The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, said “both sides are getting closer at every stage”, adding that the Istanbul talks could lead in the first instance to a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers.

However, analysts warned that the demands were unlikely to be readily accepted by the Kremlin. “I would be very careful about getting too optimistic. We have only heard the Ukrainian proposals. We need to wait for Russia’s responses,” said Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Centre.

Gabuev said Kyiv’s proposals “would look like a loss to Putin, who in his mind already settled the Crimean question a long time ago”. Russia’s military pullback “could just be a temporary strategic move”, he added.

The senior Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak described Kyiv’s proposal on guaranteed neutrality as “an effective tool for protecting our territory and sovereignty”, with “the leading armies of the world becoming guarantors and assuming specific legal obligations” to intervene in the event of aggression.

The proposal on Crimea was also “revolutionary”, Podolyak said, not only because it meant “the return of the topic of Crimea to the negotiating agenda” but because it would “allow us to preserve the current legal interpretations of Crimea, since Crimea is, of course, a part of Ukraine for us”.

Even as the peace negotiators began their work, however, Zelenskiy, said in a speech to the Danish parliament that at least seven people had been killed and 22 injured in a Russian strike on a regional government building in the southern port of Mykolaiv. “People are still going through the rubble,” he said.

Zelenskiy also called the Russian bombardment and siege of the port city of Mariupol, where local officials have said at least 5,000 people have died, a “crime against humanity … happening in front of the eyes of the whole planet, in real time”.

Russia’s foreign ministry said in a Telegram post on Tuesday night that Putin had told Emmanuel Macron in a phone call that “Ukrainian nationalist militants” in Mariupol must lay down their weapons in order to resolve the humanitarian crisis there.

Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, which began on 24 February, has killed an estimated 20,000 people, forced more than 10 million from their homes – including more than 3.8 million who have fled the country – and triggered an unprecedented range of western economic sanctions against Russia.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/29/ukraine-russia-peace-talks-istanbul-war-kyiv

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.
