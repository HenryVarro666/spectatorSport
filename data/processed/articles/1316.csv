Follow our live news updates on the Russia-Ukraine war.

BRUSSELS — President Biden and leaders of more than 30 nations convened Thursday to demonstrate united opposition to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, announcing new economic sanctions, aid for refugees, deployment of additional forces to Eastern Europe and grim preparations in case Russia uses chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.

But the historic gathering of world leaders in a series of three summits on Thursday underscored how the United States and its allies have in some ways reached their self-imposed limits in crafting a united global response to the largest European conflict in more than a half-century. While they are sharpening the tools they are using against Russia, they appear to have few new ones to reach for.

Mr. Biden and the allies have moved with unexpected speed and authority over the past four weeks, rallying much of the world against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.

And yet, the sense of stalemate on the battlefield is now also felt in the halls of diplomacy, where taking dramatic new steps to counter Mr. Putin’s aggression is proving difficult. Europeans have said they are not willing to bear the consequences of new limits on the Russian energy that they depend on. And Mr. Biden has said he is not willing to commit troops to Ukraine and risk going to war against Russia.

As the allied leaders met in Brussels, the Ukrainian military, entering the second week of a counteroffensive, claimed on Thursday to have destroyed a Russian military landing ship in the southern port of Berdyansk. In the embattled towns around the capital, Kyiv, intense fighting had set so many fires on Thursday that the city was shrouded in a ghostly haze of white smoke.

Mr. Biden said the United States would accept 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, and he and his counterparts announced a new round of weapons shipments for Ukraine, but not the fighter jets that President Volodymyr Zelensky has pleaded for.

They expressed in one voice their “resolve to counter Russia’s attempts to destroy the foundations of international security and stability.” But they again declined to enforce a no-fly zone in the skies over Ukraine, which would mean readiness to shoot down Russian planes.

They vowed to tighten sanctions on Russia, but the Europeans stopped short of blocking imports of Russian oil and gas, as the United States has done. Europe is hugely dependent on Russian energy, paying Mr. Putin the vast revenues needed to support his military — and giving him the power to wreak havoc on Europe by disrupting supplies.

“I think we’re seeing a coordinated divergence between the European Union and the United States,” said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at Eurasia Group. “There’s no rupture or even a split. Rather, there is an agreement that the U.S. will go more aggressively than the E.U. because they can afford to do so.”

Speaking to reporters Thursday evening, Mr. Biden said that he had requested the emergency meetings — with leaders of NATO, the European Union and the Group of 7 industrialized nations — to show Mr. Putin that the allies will not “crack” in their determination to keep economic pressure on Russia over days, weeks, months and more.

“We have to stay fully, totally, thoroughly united,” he said, adding that he favors ejecting Russia from the Group of 20 industrialized and developing nations.

For Mr. Zelensky, though, none of it was enough. He has become more pointed in his criticism of Western restraint on military aid as Russian forces have savaged Ukrainian cities and towns, especially in the south.

Speaking by video to NATO leaders behind closed doors, Mr. Zelensky thanked them for their support but chided them for not doing more. He described his battered country, which is not a NATO member, as trapped “in the ‘gray zone’ between the West and Russia,” according to a transcript released by the Ukrainian government.

“On Feb. 24, I addressed you with a perfectly clear, logical request to help close our skies,” he said of his request for a no-fly zone over Ukraine to keep Russian planes away. “In any format. Protect our people from Russian bombs and missiles. We did not hear a clear answer.”

“And you see the consequences today,” he added a moment later. “How many people were killed, how many peaceful cities were destroyed?”

He repeated his appeal for warplanes, though the White House and the Pentagon have said that supplying them could give Russia a pretext for drawing NATO into a direct conflict. “You have thousands of fighter jets! But we haven’t been given any yet,” Mr. Zelensky said. “To save people and our cities, Ukraine needs military assistance — without restrictions.”

For NATO leaders, the high stakes of their meeting were evident in the joint statement issued at its conclusion. The 72-year-old alliance warned Russia against deploying “chemical, biological and nuclear weapons” in Ukraine, signaling a growing concern that Mr. Putin is willing to use them to advance his aggression or to falsely implicate Ukraine’s government.

Mr. Biden was cautious Thursday in his response to questions about the warning. He declined to say whether the United States or NATO would respond militarily if Russia used chemical weapons, which are banned by international treaty.

“We would respond if he uses it,” Mr. Biden said. “The nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use.”

But in warning about the threat from weapons of mass destruction, NATO’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said the organization was “enhancing allies’ preparedness and readiness for chemical, biological and nuclear threats.” It will provide detection equipment, protection and medical support to Ukraine, he said, along with training for decontamination and crisis management to deal with the impact of any use of weapons of mass destruction.

The alliance’s top military commander, Gen. Tod D. Wolters, “has activated NATO’s chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defense elements,” Mr. Stoltenberg added, placing on increased alert NATO teams that specialize in detecting and responding to contamination after a chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear attack. Member nations are taking similar steps.

Mr. Stoltenberg noted that the use of such weapons inside Ukraine could contaminate neighboring NATO countries.

“Many people fear that Russia will use such weapons and accuse Ukraine of doing it, so it is important to precisely determine who, where and when did it so there’s no ambiguity,” said Gustav Gressel, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.

The United States hit Russia with a new round of sanctions on Thursday, targeting more than 300 members of its Parliament and dozens of defense companies, while moving to restrict Russia’s ability to use gold reserves to prop up its currency. It also imposed sanctions on Herman Gref, a Putin ally and the president and chairman of Sberbank, one of Russia’s largest banks; the bank itself was sanctioned last month.

The economic actions, which came in conjunction with new sanctions from Western allies, were the latest attempt to inflict economic pain on Mr. Putin. The United States also moved to curtail Russia’s ability to evade existing restrictions on its central bank and major financial institutions, responding to concerns that Russia was finding ways to stabilize the ruble and rebuild its foreign currency reserves.

The Treasury Department is taking aim at alternative assets that Russia could use to support its economy. It issued new guidance on Thursday to make clear that transactions involving Russia’s $130 billion of gold reserves were also subject to U.S. sanctions. Russia built up its gold war chest in recent years to help blunt the impact of earlier sanctions by using the precious metal to buy currency or secure loans.

The U.S. is working to close that loophole by threatening penalties for anyone who facilitates such transactions.

Mr. Biden and European Union leaders are expected to announce an agreement to provide significant amounts of American liquefied natural gas to Europe this year, according to two European diplomats. They said the shipments could limit Europe’s reliance on Russian energy in the near term, and boost confidence in its ability to become less dependent over time.

“The question of course isn’t whether Europe has enough oil and gas for right now, but what happens next winter,” said Jacob F. Kirkegaard, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.

In addition to accepting 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, Mr. Biden announced that the United States would donate $1 billion to help European countries deal with the surge of people fleeing Russia’s invasion, White House officials said on Thursday.

A senior administration official said special efforts were being made to welcome Ukrainians who have family members in the United States.

An estimated four million Ukrainians have poured into Poland and other countries as Mr. Putin’s forces have bombarded civilian areas across Ukraine. Mr. Biden’s commitment would significantly increase the United States’ role in dealing with the unfolding humanitarian crisis.

On the battlefields, Ukrainian fighters have had some success this week in pushing Moscow’s much larger forces farther away from Kyiv and other cities, according to Western intelligence agencies, even as the bloody siege gripping the port of Mariupol has tightened. But many Ukrainian claims of gains have been impossible to verify, and brutal street fighting still echoes through some towns that Ukrainian forces claim to have recaptured.

Russia did not immediately comment on Ukraine’s claim to have destroyed a warship in Berdyansk, whose port Moscow has used to funnel reinforcements to Mariupol and across Ukraine’s eastern front. But British and U.S. officials confirmed that it was a strike by Ukrainian forces, and videos and photos reviewed by The New York Times confirmed that a Russian ship was ablaze in the port, and showed smoke rising from others.

“The destroyed ship in Berdyansk could carry up to 20 tanks, 45 armored personnel carriers and 400 paratroopers,” the Ukrainian deputy defense minister, Anna Malyar, said in a statement on Thursday. “This is a huge target that was hit by our military.”

The United Nations says that the war has forced more than 10 million Ukrainians, about one-fourth of the population, from their homes, including the “internally displaced” who have fled to safer parts of the country — Europe’s largest refugee crisis since World War II. The U.N. children’s agency reported on Thursday that they include 4.3 million children, more than half the children in Ukraine.

On Friday, Mr. Biden is expected to travel to Poland, in part to witness the surge of people taking refuge there. In his remarks to reporters, Mr. Biden hinted that he might travel to the border with Ukraine — something that officials have been unwilling to confirm.

“I’m not supposed to say, but anyway,” he said. “I hope I get to see a lot of people.”

WARSAW — President Biden delivered a forceful denunciation of Vladimir V. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine on Saturday, declaring “for God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power,” as he cast the war as the latest front in a decades-long battle between the forces of democracy and oppression.

Ending a three-day diplomatic trip to Europe with a fiery speech outside a centuries-old castle in Warsaw, Mr. Biden described the Russian invasion of Ukraine as the “test of all time” in a post-World War II struggle between democracy and autocracy, “between liberty and repression, between a rules-based order and one governed by brute force.”

“In this battle, we need to be cleareyed,” Mr. Biden said in front of a crowd waving Polish, Ukrainian and American flags. “This battle will not be won in days or months, either. We need to steel ourselves for the long fight ahead.”

Mr. Biden used the speech to bolster a key NATO ally on Ukraine’s western border that has served as a conduit for Western arms and has absorbed more than 2 million refugees fleeing the violence, more than any other country in Europe. And he sought to prepare the public, at home and abroad, for a grinding conflict that could drag on for weeks, months or longer.

Just hours before the event, missiles struck the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, about 50 miles from the Polish border, extending Russia’s monthlong assault on major cities and civilian populations — and undercutting Russian statements a day earlier suggesting Moscow might be scaling back its goals in the war.

While declaring that “the Russian people are not our enemy,” Mr. Biden unleashed an angry tirade against Mr. Putin’s claim that the invasion of Ukraine was intended to “de-Nazify” the country. Mr. Biden called that justification “a lie,” noting that President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine is Jewish and that his father’s family was killed in the Holocaust.

“It’s just cynical,” Mr. Biden said. “He knows that. And it’s also obscene.”

It was not immediately clear whether Mr. Biden’s apparent call for the ouster of Mr. Putin was one of the off-the-cuff remarks for which he is known or a calculated jab, one of many in the speech. But it risks confirming Russia’s central propaganda claim that the West, and particularly the United States, is determined to destroy Russia.

The White House immediately sought to play down the remark. “The president’s point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region,” a White House official told reporters. “He was not discussing Putin’s power in Russia, or regime change.”

Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said Mr. Putin’s fate was not in the hands of the American president. “It’s not for Biden to decide,” Mr. Peskov told reporters. “The president of Russia is elected by the Russians.”

Experts were divided on whether Mr. Biden’s remark was intended to signal he believed Mr. Putin should be ousted, a political escalation that could have consequences on the battlefield.

Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said on Twitter that the White House’s attempt to walk back the president’s comment was “unlikely to wash.”

“Putin will see it as confirmation of what he’s believed all along,” he wrote. “Bad lapse in discipline that runs risk of extending the scope and duration of the war.”

Mr. Biden’s statement that Mr. Putin could no longer remain in power could be perceived “as a call for regime change,” said Michal Baranowski, a senior fellow and director of the Warsaw office of the German Marshall Fund, a nonpartisan policy organization. But he said he did not read it that way, and that Mr. Putin was unlikely to, either. “I think just what President Biden was saying is, how can such a terrible person be ruling Russia?” said Mr. Baranowski. “In that context, I don’t think it will lead to any escalation with Russia.”

Earlier in the day, Mr. Biden stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, and assured him that the United States considered its support for NATO to be a “sacred obligation.”

“America’s ability to meet its role in other parts of the world rests upon a united Europe,” Mr. Biden said.

While Poland’s right-wing, populist government has been embraced by Washington and Brussels as a linchpin of Western security, it has provoked quarrels with both in the past. Mr. Duda, however, thanked Mr. Biden for his support, saying that Poland stood ready as a “serious partner, a credible partner.”

At a stadium in Warsaw, Mr. Biden met with Ukrainian refugees in his first personal encounter with some of the civilians ensnared in a catastrophic humanitarian crisis caused by weeks of indiscriminate Russian shelling of Ukrainian cities and towns.

After speaking with the refugees, including several from the city of Mariupol, which has been flattened by Russian shelling, Mr. Biden called Mr. Putin “a butcher.”

That comment also prompted a retort from Mr. Peskov, who told TASS, the Russian state-owned news agency, that “such personal insults narrow the window of opportunity” for bilateral relations with the Biden administration.

Mr. Biden also met with Ukrainian ministers in his first in-person meeting with the country’s top leaders since the Russian invasion began on Feb. 24, part of what American officials hoped would be a powerful display of the United States’ commitment to Ukrainian sovereignty.

“We did receive additional promises from the United States on how our defense cooperation will evolve,” Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, told reporters, the Reuters news agency reported.

But Mr. Biden gave no indication that the United States was willing to budge from its previous rejection of Ukrainian requests to establish a no-fly zone over the country or to provide it with the MIG-29 warplanes that Poland offered some weeks ago.

As Mr. Biden visited Poland, two missiles struck Lviv, rattling residents who ran into underground shelters as smoke rose into the sky. Lviv’s mayor said a fuel storage facility was on fire, and a regional administrator said five people had been injured.

Although Russian missiles hit a warplane repair factory near Lviv on March 18, the city, which had 700,000 residents before many of them fled the war, has otherwise been spared the airstrikes and missile attacks that have hammered other Ukrainian population centers.

Mr. Biden ended his trip one day after a senior Russian general suggested that the Kremlin might be redefining its goals in the war by focusing less on seizing major cities and instead targeting the eastern Donbas region, where Russia-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces for eight years.

Mr. Biden’s administration was quietly exploring the implications of the statement by the Russian general, Sergei Rudskoi, which indicated that Mr. Putin might be looking for a way out of the brutal invasion he launched with confidence and bravado a month ago.

Western intelligence agencies have in recent weeks picked up chatter among senior Russian commanders about giving up the effort to take Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, and other key areas in the north and west of the country, according to two people with access to the intelligence. Instead, the commanders have talked more narrowly of securing the Donbas region.

Military analysts have cautioned that General Rudskoi’s statement could be intended as misdirection while Russian forces regroup for a new offensive.

Only weeks ago, Mr. Putin threatened to fully absorb Ukraine, warning that, “The current leadership needs to understand that if they continue doing what they are doing, they risk the future of Ukrainian statehood.”

In the latest instance of nuclear saber-rattling, Dmitri A. Medvedev, the vice chairman of Russia’s Security Council, restated Moscow’s willingness to use nuclear weapons against the United States and Europe if its existence was threatened.

“No one wants war, especially given that nuclear war would be a threat to the existence of human civilization,” Mr. Medvedev told Russia’s state-run RIA Novosti news agency in excerpts from an interview published on Saturday.

Hoping to rally his country and encourage negotiations with Moscow, Mr. Zelensky said that the success of a Ukrainian counteroffensive that began two weeks ago was “leading the Russian leadership to a simple and logical idea: Talk is necessary.”

For the moment, large portions of Ukraine remain a battleground in what has increasingly come to resemble a bloody stalemate between the smaller Ukrainian army and Russian troops that have struggled with logistical problems.

On Saturday, Russian forces entered the small northern city of Slavutych, near the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, where they seized the hospital and briefly detained the mayor, a regional military official said.

In response, dozens of residents unfurled the Ukrainian flag in front of city hall and chanted, “glory to Ukraine,” prompting Russian troops to fire into the air and throw stun grenades, according to videos and the official, Oleksandr Pavliuk.

He exited his presidential motorcade Thursday morning, ignoring shouted questions about the security situation in Ukraine.

Biden's first step was a 'family photo' with members of the treaty alliance, where a grinning Biden was greeted by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emanuel Macron.

After shaking hands with Johnson, Biden went to shake hands with Turkish President Recep Erdogan, whose nation has been providing armed drones to the the Ukrainian military as it counters Russia's invasion.

He then walked alongside Macron into the first session of the day for NATO, which is announcing it is expanding battle groups and beefing up its troop presence along Russia's flank.

Biden also spoke briefly with Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, whose country is among the smaller NATO allies bordering Russia who have watched the invasion with particular concern.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg kicked off the first meeting of the day with a short speech denouncing Russia's unprovoked attack on its neighbor.

'We are united in condemning the Kremlin’s unprovoked aggressions,' he said.

'We are determined to continue to impose costs on Russia to bring about the end of this brutal war,' he continued, and lauded those in Russia 'who are bravely speaking out against the war. We hear the voices. They matter,' he said.

He also paid tribute to the great courage of the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian armed forces fighting for their freedom and their rights.'

Europe is aiming to strike a deal with Biden to secure additional U.S. liquefied natural gas supplies for the next two winters and wean the continent off it its dangerous addiction to Russian energy.

Compounding the tension was a new development in Asia, as North Korea fired the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) off its east coast, according to South Korea and Japan.

'The United States strongly condemns the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) for its test of a long-range ballistic missile,' White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement.

The meeting came as Johnson urged NATO to act 'harder' against Russia to end the war 'faster' as he unveiled a wave of new sanctions.

Among the targets are the Wagner Group, a mercenary force known as 'Putin's private army.' The measures were announced as the PM arrived in Brussels for talks.

There are claims the notorious mercenaries have been tasked with assassinating Volodymyr Zelensky and other senior Ukrainian politicians.

'We've got to step up. We've got to increase our support,' Johnson said as he arrived.

Zelensky addressed the NATO summit by video link, where he begged the 30-nation alliance for more military assistance.

'To save people and our cities, Ukraine needs military assistance - without restrictions,' he said in remarks released by his government.

'Ukraine asked for your planes. So that we do not lose so many people. And you have thousands of fighter jets! But we haven't been given any yet. We asked for tanks,' he said.

'You have at least 20,000 tanks! Ukraine asked for a percent, one percent of all your tanks to be given or sold to us! But we do not have a clear answer yet... The worst thing during the war is not having clear answers to requests for help,' he noted.

He asked NATO to do more.

'NATO has yet to show what the Alliance can do to save people. To show that this is truly the most powerful defense union in the world. And the world is waiting. And Ukraine is very much waiting. Waiting for real actions,' he said.

Meanwhile, in an effort to get Europe to crack down even further financially on Russia, a major new deal to boost US gas shipments to Europe will be announced during the summit, three US officials familiar with the plan told the Washington Post.

Russia supplies 40 percent of the EU's collective natural gas needs, 27 percent of its oil imports and 46 percent of coal imports.

Biden will also huddle with key allies in Brussels and Warsaw this week to talk through plans for imposing punishing new sanctions on Russia and dealing with an extraordinary humanitarian crisis.

The allies are also expected to develop a consensus on how they would respond if Russia were to launch a cyber, chemical or even nuclear attack.

President Biden thanked the Prime Minister for Belgium's robust support in the EU for sanctions against Russia and for ongoing coordination in providing security assistance to Ukraine, the White House said

Biden wants western allies to levy heavier financial sanctions on Russia for its invasion of the Ukraine but some of those nations, which are dependent on the Kremlin for their energy needs, have show reluctance to go as far as the United States wishes.

A new deal to boost US gas shipments to Europe could clear the path for allies to sign on to tougher sanctions.

'A substantial topic of conversation - a major priority for both the President and his European allies - is to reduce the dependence of Europe on Russian gas, full stop' National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Wednesday in a briefing with reporters on the flight to Europe.

He declined to offer specifics and said Biden will discuss it during his meetings with the European Union members.

He called it a 'subject of intense back and forth' over the past days and weeks. He said the U.S. would look for new ways to 'surge' liquid natural gas supplies to Europe.

U.S. exporters have already shipped record volumes of LNG to Europe for three consecutive months, as prices have jumped to more than 10 times higher than a year ago.

Leaders may also discuss a new demand from Moscow that countries pay in rubles for their Russian gas, a move some EU diplomats said could undermine existing EU sanctions by effectively unfreezing Russian assets.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Russia will seek payment in roubles for gas sales to 'unfriendly' countries, a move that sent European gas prices soaring on concerns it would exacerbate the region's energy crunch.

Countries remain divided, however, on whether to sanction Russian oil and gas directly, a move already taken by the United States. An EU embargo would require unanimous approval from all 27 member states.

In a draft of their summit conclusions seen by Reuters, the leaders will agree to 'work together on the joint purchase of gas, LNG and hydrogen' ahead of next winter, and coordinate measures to fill gas storage.

The European Commission said on Wednesday it was ready to lead negotiations pooling demand and seeking gas ahead of next winter, following a similar model to how the bloc bought COVID-19 vaccines.

Leaders will discuss that plan - as well as a proposed law for countries to fill gas storage ahead of winter - on Friday.

Biden arrived on a day when NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg talked up increased military deployments on its eastern flank along the Russian border, and warned that any use of chemical weapons by Russia would be a game changer.

He said any use of chemical weapons would 'totally change the nature of the conflict.'

Stoltenberg also criticized Russia Wednesday for 'continuing nuclear saber rattling' that contradicts its own statements at the United Nations.

'Russia should stop this dangerous irresponsible nuclear rhetoric,' he told reporters a day before Biden is set to meet with NATO allies. 'But let there be no doubt about our readiness to protect and defend allies against any threat anytime.'

'I think I think that's the most important message to convey that any use of chemical weapons is is absolutely unacceptable and will have far reaching consequences.'

And Stoltenberg added: 'Russia must understand that it can never win a nuclear war.'

Members of the 30-nation strong alliance have deployed four new battle groups, Stoltenberg said. They are deployed in Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia, and Hungary.

Russia's invasion 'will have long-term consequences for our security,' Stoltenberg said. He said there were now 40,000 forces under NATO command at a high level of readiness alert, along with 100,000 U.S. troops in Europe.

Biden enters his day of meetings with NATO, the European Union and the G7 with a packed agenda.

Ahead of his departure, Biden acknowledged it was a 'real threat' that Vladimir Putin might use chemical weapons in the Ukraine, a topic of concern for world leaders ahead of their NATO summit.

'I think it's a real threat,' Biden told reporters ahead of his departure for Brussels.

Officials have been concerned that Putin will use more aggressive tactics and disruptive weapons as his invasion of the Ukraine reaches a stalemate.

The situation in the Ukraine is the main topic at Thursday's NATO meeting, where Biden will rally western allies and announce a new round of financial sanctions against Putin's government.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will take part of the special summit, which was pulled together in a week, via video link as the Russian invasion of his country enters its fourth week.

Biden has called for the United States to lead a 'new world order.'

'We're going to — there's going to be a new world order out there, and we've got to lead it,' Biden said on Monday. 'And we've got to unite the rest of the free world in doing it.'

On the trip, Biden intends to shore up the NATO alliance as the war in the Ukraine threatens to settle in for the long haul. He'll put pressure on the allies to continue financial sanctions, announce additional humanitarian assistance and could reveal a plan to increase U.S. boots on the ground in Eastern Europe.

'Our goal is to weaken Russia's hand, tactically, and strategically, and to strengthen Ukraine's hand on the battlefield and at the negotiating table. We know this conflict has to be resolved diplomatically if we're going to save lives,' State Department spokesman Ned Price told CNN Wednesday morning of the trip.

He will also travel to Poland to meet with U.S. troops stationed there, review the situation with Ukraine refugees and meet with Polish President Andrzej Duda.

The trip will be heavy on symbolism, with the pictures showing a united front among the allies and a compassionate Biden meeting the displaced as Vladimir Putin continues to pound away at the Ukraine.

'There will be hard days ahead in Ukraine — hardest for the Ukrainian troops on the frontlines and the civilians under Russian bombardment. This war will not end easily or rapidly,' National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on Monday in previewing the trip.

'For the past few months, the West has been united. The President is traveling to Europe to ensure we stay united, to cement our collective resolve, to send a powerful message that we are prepared and committed to this for as long as it takes,' he added.

Biden's trip comes as the allies are pushing the boundries of what they can do to stop Putin.

Europe, which still needs Russian oil, is reaching the limits of the financial sanctions it can implement. And the West has also committed as much military assistance as it can - short of putting boots on the ground in the Ukraine.

Biden will start his trip Thursday in Brussels, where he attend emergency summit meetings of NATO, the European Union and the G7.

And Russia is warning the 30-nation alliance to take care what it decides at its meeting, saying a peace keeping mission to Ukraine could trigger 'direct clashes' between Russia and NATO.

Poland said last week that it would formally submit a proposal for the peacekeeping mission in Ukraine at the Thursday summit.

'I hope they understand what they are talking about,' Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told staff and students at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations on Wednesday.

'This will be the direct clash between the Russian and NATO armed forces that everyone has not only tried to avoid but said should not take place in principle.'

The Biden administration has appeared to rule that Poland's proposal, saying they are committed to not putting U.S. troops on the ground in the Ukraine.

At a summit where the administration is promising 'deliverables,' not just talk, the first arms deliveries out of an $800 million package Biden announced earlier this month have begun to arrive.

It includes 800 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, and 100 armed drones, CNN reported.

The administration has also delivered most of the separate $200 million package Biden announced March 12. Officials are touting new announcements of material to support Ukraine at the summit.

Meanwhile, a slew of new economic sanctions will be aimed at trying to deter Putin.

'It cannot be business as usual for Russia,' Sullivan said on Monday.

The president will announce the U.S. will target 400 people, officials told the Wall Street Journal, including 328 Russian lawmakers in the Duma and other elites.

The United States has already announced a slew of sanctions against Putin himself, his inner circle, the Russian oligarchs and Russian businesses.

And though the Russian currency, the ruble, dropped down to being worth next to nothing and the nation was last week at risk of defaulting on its debt, sanctions have done little to change the Russian leader's posture.

This week, the ruble stabilized and Russia was able to make interest payments on $117 million due on two bonds denominated in U.S. dollars. And while about half of Russia's $640 billion in foreign reserves is frozen, it has been able to offset that by continued fuel sales to Europe amid a price spike in the cost of oil and gas.

Biden also announced earlier this month the U.S. would ban imports of Russian oil, natural gas and coal, though America doesn't use much of those products.

The E.U. unveiled a plan to cut Russian gas imports by approximately two-thirds this year, but it's unclear how quickly member nations will be able to accomplish that given their heavy dependence on Russian oil.

Sullivan said the U.S. would make new announcements about efforts to help European countries wean themselves off Russian energy.

Biden also may announce more U.S. troops wil be deployed to NATO countries in Eastern Europe to help ease worries among those nations that Putin's invasion could spread, NBC News reported.

Sullivan previewed the announcement on Monday when he said Biden would announce the 'next phase' of military assistance to Ukraine during his trip.

'He will work with Allies on longer-term adjustments to NATO force posture on the eastern flank,' Sullivan said.

The fighting in the Ukraine is entering its fourth week - above a marke in Kharkiv that was destroyed by Russian missiles

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has warned sending a peace keeping mission to Ukraine could trigger 'direct clashes' between Russia and NATO

Russia's offensive has now stalled on all fronts amid reports that Ukraine has started launching counter-attacks to push Putin's forces back

Biden recently reviewed options for permanent increases in the number of U.S. troops in Eastern Europe, and Poland is among the possible locations, NBC News noted.

'At the summit,' the an administration official said, 'we expect NATO leaders to review the alliance's current deterrent and defensive force posture, especially in light of the deteriorated security environment caused by Russia's unprovoked and unjustified further invasion of Ukraine.'

One fear among leaders to be addressed is Putin's next move in the Ukraine.

With the invasion at a stalement, there is concern the Russian president will step up his game, possibly using chemical or even a small nuclear weapon. The Biden administration is also warning that cyber attacks could come.

'Now Putin's back is against the wall. He wasn't anticipating the extent or the strength of our unity. And the more his back is against the wall, the greater the severity of the tactics he may employ,' Biden told business leaders in Washington on Monday.

NATO leaders could announce the addition of a new chemical and biological weapons unit to the NATO Response Force to counter Russia.

American officials have expressed concern that Putin could use chemical weapons after the Russian Defense Ministry said Ukraine could make such a move, in what U.S. officials say could be a false flag operation to justify any moves by Moscow.

Russia has wielded chemical weapons in the past.

Moscow used the deadly Novichok poison in 2018 an attempt to assassinate a defector living in Salisbury, England. And it is suspected of using a similar poison against opposition leader Alexei Navalny in 2020.

Russia also offered diplomatic cover to Syrian use of chemical agents. It accused the West of being behind the 2017 attack on Khan Shaykhun with Sarin or similar nerve agent.

The invasion has not gone well for Russia.

Ukrainian forces remain in control of all major cities across the country except for the regional capital of Kherson, where counter-attacks are now underway in an effort to recapture it.

Counter-attacks are also underway to the west of the capital Kyiv, in Voznesensk in the south, and around Izyum in the north-east.

Ukraine's generals believe Russian forces only have enough supplies to last three more days in the field, while Western experts have said Putin's men will soon need to switch on to the defensive as their stockpiles run low.

The Kremlin has refused to rule out using nuclear weapons.

Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesman, was asked three times on CNN whether he could definitively rule out the possibility of the Russian leader pushing the button - and three times refused to give a straight answer.

Instead, Peskov said only that Russian doctrine allows Putin to use nukes see off 'existential threats' - raising fears he could justify using the weapons over Ukraine, having previously said the country poses a direct threat to the security of Russia.

John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, slammed Peskov's rhetoric as 'dangerous' saying it is 'not the way a responsible nuclear power should act'.

Kirby added that the US is keeping Russia's nuclear arsenal - believed to be the world's largest at 6,500 warheads - under constant surveillance and has not yet seen any indication that it is preparing to use the weapons.

Biden will also talk to E.U. leaders about China's relationship with Russia. Biden spoke to Chinese leader Xi Jinping last week amid concerns Beijing could back the invasion.

E.U. leaders have a summit with Xi on April 1.

'This will be an opportunity — Thursday — for the United States and our European partners to coordinate closely on what our message is,' Sullivan said.

Thursday's meetings will also reveal what Biden and the allies won't do.

The U.S. has already ruled out Zelensky's request for a no-fly zone over the Ukraine, arguing it could escalate the conflict into World War III.

People wait at Przemysl train station before continuing their journey back into war-torn Ukraine in Przemysl, Poland. Nearly two-thirds of the more than 3 million people to have fled Ukraine since Russia's invasion last month have come to Poland, which shares a 310-mile border with its eastern neighbor

Leaders may also discuss whether or not to push Russia out of the G20. Putin is expected to attend November's gathering of the world leaders and there are some countries in the 20-nation alliance that would likely opposing removing Russia.

On Friday, Biden heads to Poland, where he will discuss the situation with Ukrainian refugees. Poland has taken in nearly 2 million of them.

'He will announce further American contributions to a coordinated humanitarian response to ease the suffering of civilians inside Ukraine and to respond to the growing flow of refugees,' Sullivan said.

While in Poland, he will hold an event related to refugees, which could include meeting with some of the Ukrainians who had fled their country but the details are still being worked out, The Washington Post reported.

Biden will also visit with American troops stationed in Poland as part of NATO forces and meet with President Duda.

What's not on the table during this trip is a Biden stop in the Ukraine.

'Any president of the United States traveling into a war zone requires not only security considerations but also an enormous amount of resources on the ground, which is always a factor for us as we make considerations,' press secretary Jen Psaki said this week. 'It was a decision made about what would be most effective on the trip.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10645343/Biden-lands-Brussels-NATO-summit.html

STORYLINE:

On April 23rd 2014 commanding officer Jan-Kjetil Folland gives the order for ""battle stations"" on board the Norwegian NATO flagship the Valkyrien.

An alarm sounds and gunfire from a .50 calibre machine gun echoes over the waters of the Baltic Sea.

April 23rd's simulated ""battle stations"" exercises are part of a ""show of strength"" deployment for eastern members of the alliance.

Five battleships took part in the exercises, and crew members fired weapons off the deck of the Valkyrien - the flagship of the Standing NATO Mine Counter-Measures Group ONE.

Lieutenant Commander Dave Benham, NATO's chief public affairs officer, said that the group's deployment is ""one of those measures designed to assure our allies in the Baltic of NATO's resolve and solidarity and preparedness to meet any challenge"".

The exercises come amid the West's ongoing dispute with Russia over Ukraine.

***

Ukraine's ousted president, Viktor Yanukovych, said on April 2nd that he was ""wrong"" to invite Russian troops into Crimea, and vowed to try to persuade Russia to return the Black Sea peninsula.

In his first interview since fleeing to Russia in February 2014, Yanukovych told The Associated Press and Russia's state NTV television that he still hopes to negotiate with Russian President Vladimir Putin to get back the coveted region.

Russia annexed Crimea in March following a hastily called referendum held after Russian troops took control of the region.

Ukraine and the West have rejected the move as illegal.

""Crimea is a tragedy. It is a great tragedy,"" Yanukovych told The AP, insisting that Russia's takeover of Crimea wouldn't have happened if he had stayed in power.

He fled Ukraine after three months of anti-government protests against his rule.

The 63-year-old said he has personally met with Putin since he arrived and hopes to have more meetings with the Russian leader to negotiate Crimea's return.

***

On April 7th Pro-Russian protesters set tyres and plastic barriers on fire in front of the regional assembly building in Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine.

The building was seized by separatists after demonstrations on Sunday but the Ukrainian police have since regained control.

Earlier on April 7th pro-Russia and pro-Ukraine demonstrators clashed in front of the regional assembly building and police struggled to keep the two groups apart as sticks and stones were thrown by protesters on both sides.

Eastern Ukraine was the heartland of support for President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Russia after months of protests.

About half of the region's residents are ethnic Russians, many of whom say Ukraine's acting authorities are nationalists who will oppress Russians.

***

On April 16th tension was high in the eastern Ukrainian city of Slovyansk as pro-Russia armed militia patrolled the streets.

One man was seen being punched and kicked by unidentified assailants. He was later led away by members of the pro-Russia militia.

Dozens of masked gunmen, backed with at least six armoured vehicles waving Russian flags, surrounded the main administrative building in Slovyansk.

The troops were enthusiastically greeted in the largely pro-Russian city.

""We've managed to defeat fascism back in 1945 and they wanted us to forget about this triumph. But we don't want to forgive or forget,"" said one man.

He said they came from Crimea to help the people of Donbas region, where Slovyansk is located.

Armed men in Slovyansk have seized the local police headquarters and the administration building, demanding broader autonomy for their eastern Ukraine region and closer ties with Russia.

Their actions have been repeated in at least eight other cities in eastern Ukraine.

Eastern Ukraine was the support base for ousted President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Russia after months of protests over his decision to back away from closer relations with the European Union and turn toward Russia.

Opponents of the government that replaced him allege the new authorities will repress eastern Ukraine's large Russian-speaking population.

***

On April 17th the Prime Minister of Ukraine accused Russia of orchestrating unrest in eastern Ukraine.

Arseniy Yatsenyuk was addressing journalists following a meeting between Ukrainian ministers and business representatives in Kiev.

""There is only one person in the world who believes that Russian troops are not present in the east of Ukraine. This person is Vladimir Putin,"" Yatsenyuk said.

He added that despite admitting that Russian troops had been involved in a military intervention in Crimea, Putin was denying that ""saboteurs"" who had ""created a terrorist network on Ukraine territory"" were following his orders.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on April 17th rejected claims that Russian special forces are fomenting unrest in eastern Ukraine, but recognised for the first time that the troops in unmarked uniforms who overtook Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula before its annexation by Moscow were Russian soldiers.

The well-armed, Moscow-backed insurgency sowing chaos in eastern Ukraine scored a new victory on Wednesday, seizing armoured vehicles and weapons from underequipped government forces, then rolling through two cities to a hero's welcome.

Meanwhile, officials from the US, Russia, Ukraine and the European Union were meeting in Geneva on Thursday for negotiations aimed at persuading Russia to back off in Ukraine following its annexation of Crimea.

Yatsenyuk said he did not have ""exaggerated expectations"" of the Geneva talks.

***

On May 2nd pro-Russians clashed with Ukrainian government supporters in the Black Sea port city of Odessa.

Supporters of the government in Kiev armed themselves with rocks and other projectiles.

Police tried to separate both sets of demonstrators.

Police said one person died from gunshot fire and another was wounded.

Odessa is some 550 kilometres (330 miles) from the turmoil in Ukraine's east.

It has remained largely untroubled by unrest since the February toppling of pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych, which ignited tensions in the east.

***

On May 11th almost 90 percent of voters in a key industrial region in eastern Ukraine voted in favour of sovereignty, according to pro-Russian separatists as they announced preliminary results of a twin referendum that is certain to deepen the turmoil in the country.

Roman Lyagin, election chief of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, said around 75 percent of the Donetsk region's 3 million or so voters cast ballots, and the vast majority backed sovereignty.

With no international election monitors in place, it was all but impossible to verify the claims.

Lyagin said they understood the outcome would fall on deaf ears, but that the people of Donetsk have spoken.

""European organisations and international governments will not recognise it, but through this referendum we want everyone to listen to us and the power of the people.""

The preliminary vote count was announced just two hours after the polls closed in an election conducted via paper ballots.

A second referendum that was also organised by pro-Russian separatists was held in eastern Ukraine's industrial Luhansk region, but no immediate results were released.

Ukraine's central government and the West had condemned the balloting as a sham and a violation of international law.

They have accused Moscow of orchestrating the unrest in a possible attempt to grab another piece of the country weeks after the annexation of Crimea.

The results of the two referendums could hasten the break-up of the country and worsen what is already the gravest crisis between the West and Russia since the end of the Cold War.

***

On May 22nd at least eleven Ukrainian troops were killed and about 30 others were wounded when pro-Russian insurgents attacked a military checkpoint, the deadliest raid in weeks of fighting in eastern Ukraine.

AP journalists saw 11 bodies scattered around the checkpoint on the edge of the village of Blahodatne, about 30 kilometres (20 miles) south of the city of Donetsk.

Witnesses said that more than 30 Ukrainian troops were wounded when the insurgents attacked the checkpoint, and some of them were in grave condition.

""Three of my friends have fallen, and I cannot even collect their bodies. Their combat unit has been lying there in the field for over 30 minutes already,"" said one Ukrainian soldier standing just metres away from the scene.

The attack came three days before the country's presidential vote.

Three charred Ukrainian armoured infantry vehicles, their turrets blown away by powerful explosions, and several burned trucks stood at the site of the combat area. A military helicopter landed on the site, carrying officials who inspected the scene.

The Ukrainian Defence Ministry confirmed the attack, but wouldn't comment on casualties. There was no report of casualties on the insurgent side.

""At first the vehicles came and cleared (destroyed) the scene. After that, the helicopters cleaned what was left of the place"", said a paramedic, standing outside the local Volnovakha hospital.

The Volnovakha hospital was closed to the media, as Ukrainian soldiers rushed in and out, and guarded the entrances.

In the town of Horlivka, a rebel commander claimed responsibility for the raid and produced an array of weapons they said they had seized.

Scores have been killed in fighting between pro-Russian insurgents, who have seized government buildings and engaged in clashes with government troops in eastern Ukraine.

May 22nd's carnage cast a shadow over Ukraine's presidential vote on May 25th, which insurgents in the east have pledged to derail.

***

US President Barack Obama said on June 4th that the Ukrainian people had made a ""wise selection"" in electing their new leader.

Obama was speaking during a meeting with Ukraine's President-elect Petro Poroshenko in Warsaw, Poland.

He said he had been ""deeply impressed"" with Poroshenko's vision, and called on the international community to support Poroshenko in his efforts.

Obama described recent events in Ukraine as an ""incredible outpouring of democracy in the face of actions by Russia, as well as armed militias in certain portions of the East"" and said the US was committed to standing behind Ukraine.

In tandem with June 4th's meeting, the US announced it would send Kiev an additional 5 million US dollars in equipment, as Ukraine's military continues to suffer casualties in its confrontation with pro-Russian insurgents, especially in the country's east.

More significant than the dollar amount was the nature of the new aid, with the White House saying for the first time that the assistance would include body armour and night vision goggles: tools that could directly help Ukraine's troops as they battle separatists.

Until now, the US has only provided other nonlethal forms of aid such as clothes, food and radios.

***

On June 7th Ukraine's new president attended a ceremony in central Kiev after taking the oath of office at Ukraine's parliament in the morning.

Petro Poroshenko was greeted by an honour guard at St Sophia Square in the capital as crowds waved national flags and cheered for their new leader.

The 48-year-old Poroshenko replaces an interim leader who had been in office since Russia-friendly president Viktor Yanukovych fled the country in February.

Poroshenko assumed power a day after meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin at D-Day commemoration ceremonies in France.

***

On June 13th Ukrainian government troops, reinforced by volunteers from a paramilitary battalion, fought pro-Russia separatists in the southern port of Mariupol, Ukraine's interior minister said.

Arsen Avakov said that four government troops were wounded as forces retook buildings occupied by the rebels in the centre of the city and that troops destroyed a light armoured vehicle used by the separatists.

About a hundred members of the Azov Battalion militia forces, controlled by Kiev were seen at the scene of clashes, singing the national anthem, cheering and shouting ""Azov, Azov"", as they were leaving the scene in military trucks.

Remnants of a destroyed and burned out military truck and APC were seen at the spot where the heaviest fight took place.

The APC had DNR sprayed on it, which is the abbreviation for the Donetsk People's Republic in Russian.

The renewed fighting came as rebel leaders confirmed they have three tanks.

Ukrainian officials have said the tanks crossed from the Russian side of the porous border and were attacked by Ukrainian troops, but there has been no independent confirmation the tanks came from Russia.

***

As a shaky cease-fire in the east entered its final hours on June 26th, thousands of Ukrainians in cars stuffed with their belongings lined up at the border to cross into Russia, some vowing never to return.

Many of them queued at the Izvaryne crossing, their cars laden with household items, including refrigerators.

One local commander at a rebel-controlled border post outside the city of Luhansk said 5,000 people had left by evening, joining a stream that has continued unabated during the weeklong truce that has failed to end the gunfire and shelling.

""It's scary. We are afraid for the kid,"" said a young woman called Anastasia, who had come to the border with her husband and small child.

Russia says tens of thousands of Ukrainians have arrived in the two and a half months since Ukraine's government began fighting separatists in the east, a heavily industrial region with a large population of ethnic Russians, many of whom feel strong ties to Moscow.

Air strikes and artillery attacks by the Ukrainian military have killed more than 400 people since mid-April, according to a United Nations estimate.

The fleeing Ukrainians who talked to the Associated Press did not indicate whether or not they supported the armed separatists, who have seized government buildings, declared independence and asked Russia to annex the region.

""We don't have any relatives in Russia, only friends. We are going to claim refugee status and then it depends on how the Russian Federation treats us,"" said Dimitriy, who was waiting in his car to cross into Russia.

Russia's migration service said last week that it had registered the arrival of 90,000 Ukrainians, but few asked for refugee status, which would oblige them to stay in Russia at least six months.",http://www.aparchive.com/clipbin/AB29CD4CB135B1343137B3AC4903320D8D4D0CCD8C01

(Daniel Becerril/Reuters)

Texas governor Greg Abbott reversed his recent policy to require Texas state law enforcement to inspect trucks again after they had already been inspected by U.S. and Mexican border and customs agents when crossing the southern border. It’s a relief that he realized his mistake and corrected it because it was causing miles-long delays in sweltering heat and hurting the economies of both Texas and Mexico. Supply chains don’t need any more stress than they already have right now, and it’s very uncommon for illegal immigrants to use commercial trucks to cross the border.

Cross-border trucking between the U.S. and Mexico is always more of a mess than between the U.S. and Canada. That’s partly because Mexico is not as well governed as Canada, so things don’t run as smoothly. But it’s also because of protectionist policies by the U.S.

Some background: Congress banned Mexican truckers from entering the U.S. in 1982. NAFTA, which came into effect in 1994, committed the U.S. to removing that restriction by 2000. The U.S. left the restriction in place anyway, and was found to be in violation of the agreement in 2001, right as George W. Bush was beginning his presidency. The Bush administration said it would remove the restriction.

But organized labor and environmental groups wouldn’t have it. They sued to keep the restriction in place. The environmentalists claimed that Mexican trucks did not meet American safety and environmental regulations. The Teamsters and other unions had an obvious motive: keeping out the competition. Mexican truckers are willing to work for less than the union pay rate, and no company would hire a Teamsters member if a Mexican driver were available on the same route.

In 2004, overturning a ruling from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court ruled against the environmentalists and unions and said that the Bush administration could remove the restriction and bring the U.S. in line with its obligations under NAFTA. Clarence Thomas wrote for the unanimous court.

The U.S. continued to drag its feet on approving Mexican carriers, however. At this point, Mexico would have been within its rights to impose retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. for failing to meet its NAFTA obligations, but it held off. The Bush administration created a pilot program in 2007 that waived the requirements for a select number of Mexican carriers. The program included safety examinations for every truck and required the Mexican drivers to read and speak English.

Congress defunded the pilot program in 2009. At this point, Mexico did retaliate, imposing tariffs on American products. The Obama administration started a new pilot program in 2011. This program addressed Congress’s purported concerns about safety and regulatory compliance by requiring a more comprehensive inspection of Mexican trucks and requiring GPS and electronic recording devices on every truck to enforce hours-of-service limits and location rules.

The Teamsters and a trade group for U.S. independent truckers sued to block the new pilot program. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2013 ruled against them again, with then-Judge Brett Kavanaugh writing the opinion that rejected every argument the petitioners made.

The three-year program ended in 2014. Over the length of the program, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) performed 5,545 inspections and Mexican trucks crossed the border 28,225 times. They traveled 1,263,630 miles in border states and 255,392 miles in non-border states.

The FMCSA used that huge sample size and reported back to Congress. It found that “Mexico-domiciled motor carriers operating beyond the commercial zones had safety records that were equal to or better than the national average for U.S. and Canadian motor carriers operating in the United States.” Participants in the pilot program actually had lower rates of infractions in numerous categories than American or Canadian drivers.

The FMCSA began allowing a select number of Mexican carriers to run cross-border routes in 2015. The Teamsters and other trucking organizations sued again, claiming, in part, that the FMCSA did not have enough data. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the case in 2017, writing that “the parties do not raise any arguments the merits of which we may review.”

The USMCA, NAFTA’s replacement, keeps just about everything the same for cross-border trucking. As things currently stand, a capped number of Mexican carriers may operate long-haul routes across the border, but no Mexican carrier may haul freight between two points within the U.S., which is called “cabotage.”

That means when Mexican trucks make a delivery in the U.S., they can only pick up freight headed back to Mexico. Given that inflexibility, it’s advantageous to have U.S. carriers transport freight in the U.S.

That means that in practice, Mexican drivers often don’t drive long-haul routes. It’s more common for freight forwarders to book shipments in multiple stages. (For a quick video that demonstrates the process, click here.) There are many drayage trucking companies near the border that drive freight back and forth between transloading facilities all day. An example might be a Mexican driver picking up a shipment from Monterrey and dropping it off in Nuevo Laredo. A drayage carrier either unloads that trailer and combines it with other shipments or just hooks up the same trailer to its truck to drive it through customs for both countries and drop it off in Laredo. Then, a U.S. carrier picks up the shipment in Laredo and drives on to its final destination in Houston.

Aside from the cabotage restrictions, using drayage carriers can often make sense because the customs process is so time-consuming. There are always lines of trucks waiting to cross the World Trade Bridge between Laredo and Nuevo Laredo. The U.S. and Mexico have made efforts to speed up the process in the past few years, but delays can still drag on for hours at peak times, and the entire border-crossing process can take two days. Having long-haul trucks tied up in that traffic jam when they could be making other deliveries is not a good use of resources.

The multi-stage border-crossing process wastes fuel and time, and it requires more truck drivers than if drivers were simply allowed to drive the same shipment the whole way and pick up whatever freight made sense economically wherever it’s located. Given that shippers near the southern border complain of driver shortages on both sides, and we know Mexican trucks are fully capable of meeting American safety standards, the federal government should rethink its regulatory approach again.

Contrary to what free-trade opponents might expect, this particular case of trade between two countries at different levels of economic development actually resulted in the less developed country raising its standards to meet the demands of the more developed country. Mexico went above and beyond what was required of it in NAFTA and spent large sums of money to bring its trucking up to American standards.

The European Union allows cabotage between its member states with some restrictions. Drivers there are allowed to perform up to three cabotage operations over a seven-day period so long as the journey began with a cross-border transport. Applying that principle to the southern border might mean a Mexican driver picks up freight in Monterrey and drives it all the way to Houston, makes a delivery from Houston to Austin, then picks up Monterrey-bound freight in Austin and San Antonio and drives it back across the border.

Allowing such movements would be much more efficient and require fewer drivers than the status quo. As we saw over the last few days, the highway connections between the U.S. and Mexico are vital to the economies of both countries. By speeding up the customs process and standing up to the Teamsters by allowing cabotage, the federal government can remove impediments to the efficient functioning of supply chains between Mexico and the U.S.",https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/

Mr. Bergeron is signalling me that he has something to say.

It is a pleasure to give you the floor for your opening address. You have five minutes.

Thank you for everything you are doing during these difficult times, Minister, for your service and your leadership and for appearing today.

From the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development, we have Marta Morgan, deputy minister of foreign affairs. Welcome.

Now, I would like to welcome the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ms. Joly, and the team of senior officials who are with us today.

Colleagues, as usual, I will do my best to signal you with this yellow piece of paper when there are 30 seconds in your questioning or testimony time. I'll do it both virtually and in person. It's worked quite well. I encourage you to keep an eye on this card.

I would also like to remind everyone that all comments and questions by members and witnesses must be addressed to the chair.

Before speaking, please wait until I recognize you by name. When speaking, please speak slowly and clearly. When you're not speaking, your mike should be on mute.

Please also note that screenshots and taking photos of your screen are not allowed.

Members participating in person, keep in mind the Board of Internal Economy's guidelines for mask use and health protocols.

As always, interpretation is available for this meeting. You can access it by clicking on the globe icon at the bottom of your screen.

Pursuant to the motion adopted on February 5, the committee is meeting on its study of the mandate letters of the Minister of Foreign Affairs.

As the French maxim says, time flies when you are in good company. Because we have asked the Minister to be with us for two hours, and she could unfortunately only give us one hour, time is going to fly very fast. Since the main discussion with her will take place during that hour and we will then hold our discussions with the senior officials, I am wondering whether we can consider the hours of this meeting as forming two meetings that are separate from each other. That would mean that we could do the speaking rounds in more of the spirit of collaboration that prevailed in the previous Parliament, which allows more room for the smaller parties, the Bloc Québécois and the New Democratic Party.

You are essentially proposing to start a new session for the second hour of the meeting with the group of witnesses made up of senior officials. Is that right?

[English]

Let me make sure I have an integrated list of people who wish to intervene. I think all the members are in person.

Are there comments or interventions on this point? Essentially, it is to restart after the minister's time with us with a new panel and a speaking order of six-minute allocations at the beginning of that.

We are moving much further away from that principle if we go to four six-minute rounds and then another four six-minute rounds in the second hour. It means two members of this committee would get disproportionately more time to the detriment of the other nine members of the committee. I don't think that's fair.

It is being suggested that two of the 11 members of this committee get half of the time. That's not fair, because each member on this committee should be given equal time, to the greatest extent possible. That doesn't happen under the routine motions we adopted, but we strive for that to the greatest extent possible.

We're 11 members on this committee. Each of us is primus inter pares . We all have the right to be on this committee and to have equal time.

Mr. Chong spoke out against the proposal. Are there any other interventions, please, colleagues?

It's certainly within the committee's hands to change the routine motions as originally adopted through proposals like Monsieur Bergeron's, but I'd like to hear other views from members, hopefully fairly quickly, in the interest of time.

[Translation]

I am proposing that because I see there is the potential for debate here. Could we come back to this after the Minister leaves?

Mr. Chair, I understand the suggestion made by my colleague, Mr. Bergeron. As he said so well, we have limited time with the Minister. May I propose that we have this discussion after the Minister leaves?

Mr. Bergeron, are you happy for us to resume this discussion after the Minister's appearance?

Minister, thank you again for being here and welcome to the committee. You have the floor.

: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Mr. Chair.

I am pleased to be with you today.

I also want to thank the entire team from Global Affairs Canada. I would like to thank Ms. Morgan, who is accompanying me, and everyone who is online.

[English]

I'm glad to have this opportunity to appear before you to discuss my mandate letter and my priorities as Minister of Foreign Affairs. I would be remiss if I did not start with the impacts of Russia's illegal and unprovoked further invasion of Ukraine.

It's not hyperbole to say that in the past month the world has fundamentally changed. When Vladimir Putin launched his unjustifiable further invasion of Ukraine, he launched the greatest challenge to global security since World War II.

[Translation]

The last few weeks have been a somewhat brutal reminder that democracy is not guaranteed and can never be taken for granted.

Today, the battlefield is in Ukraine, but the threat hangs over the entire world. As President Zelensky said last week in his moving address to Parliament, Ukraine, a sovereign country, is fighting for its life. Ukrainians are defending their freedom and their right to choose a better future for their children.

The Government of Canada has done everything in its power since the start of the crisis to contribute to a diplomatic solution and supply vital support to Ukraine. We do this in the memory of those who have perished since the conflict began and to honour the courage of the Ukrainians who continue to fight fiercely day after day.

[English]

We're in constant communications with Ukraine and our allies. I just had a conversation this morning with Dmytro Kuleba, the foreign affairs minister from Ukraine, and we're holding a common diplomatic front. Canada and the international community must hold those responsible to account.

[Translation]

During this crisis, we have seen an unprecedented mobilization of the global economies to impose severe sanctions on the Russian regime. The economic sanctions we have put in place have a clear, precise goal: to suffocate the Russian regime and the individuals who have financed and allowed this invasion. That includes the people who are fuelling this war with propaganda and disinformation by the bucketload.

To date, Canada has imposed sanctions on over 1,000 Russian and Belarusian individuals and entities for their role in the Ukrainian crisis. We have excluded the Russian banks from the international SWIFT system; we have prohibited imports of crude oil and cancelled all Russian export permits; we are preventing Russian and Belarusian aircraft from entering our airspace; and we are denying access to Russian vessels in our ports.

[English]

We're delivering lethal and non-lethal aid to Ukraine. We have donated nearly $200 million to humanitarian efforts, and we are ready to welcome into Canada Ukrainians fleeing the war.

As you have heard me say many times, all options remain on the table, and we will continue to put maximum pressure on the Russian regime while supporting the people of Ukraine.

[Translation]

We have at all times urged Russia to change course, using all diplomatic means at our disposal. Canada has played a leadership role by putting maximum pressure on the Russians in multilateral forums, including the United Nations, the G7, NATO, the Arctic Council, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Commonwealth, and the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie.

This is also why Canada was one of the first countries to take the issue before the International Criminal Court. It is also why we are supporting Ukraine in the proceedings it has instituted before the International Court of Justice. Canada will continue to do everything in its power to keep the Russian regime's back to the wall.

[English]

We will seek accountability for this atrocity. I want to thank my opposition critics for the unanimity we have been able to show on this critical file. I believe the message that Canadians and our Parliament stand united with the people of Ukraine is a strong one. I also want to thank you for the constructive ideas you have offered.

Before we turn to your questions, I would like to speak to two files that I am working on alongside our government's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The current crisis has underscored the need for a new approach to working with our democratic partners in the Arctic and Indo-Pacific regions. Upholding and strengthening the rules-based international order are core Canadian principles that have also been under long-term strategic pressure in both the Arctic and the Indo-Pacific, so I look forward to pursuing my engagement in both of these regions and to working collaboratively with you and all members of the committee and of this House.
