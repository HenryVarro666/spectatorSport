Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that 130 people had been saved after the bombing of a theatre in the port city of Mariupol under Russian siege, but “hundreds” were still trapped in the rubble.

Ukraine accused Russia of hitting the theatre on Wednesday. It had been feared that up to 1,000 people may have been taking refuge underground at the time of the blast. Russia has denied responsibility for the attack.

“More than 130 people have been saved. But hundreds of Mariupol residents are still beneath the rubble,” Zelenskyy said in a video address on Facebook on Friday.

He promised to continue rescue operations in Mariupol “despite shelling” in the southern city that has suffered vast destruction.

“Despite the shelling, despite all the difficulties, we will continue the rescue work,” Zelenskyy added.

Later on Friday, Mariupol city council said: “According to initial information, there are no dead. But there is information about one person gravely wounded.”

Earlier, Ukraine’s ombudswoman Lyudmyla Denisova said a bomb shelter underneath the Drama Theatre survived the impact and some “adults and children” had emerged alive but added there was still no information on more than 1,000 other people official figures suggest were sheltering there when the bomb fell.

The Ukrainian authorities have not confirmed the number of possible casualties.

Days before the apparent attack, satellite images shared by private company Maxar showed the word “DETI” – “children” in Russian – written on the ground on either side of the building.

Meanwhile, the Russian army on Friday said it was fighting in the city centre of Mariupol.

Zelenskyy said Western deliveries of weapons to Ukraine were arriving too slowly.

“We again remind certain Western leaders that it will be a moral defeat for them … if Ukraine does not receive advanced weapons,” he said.

He repeated calls for European ports to deny entry to all Russian ships and criticised some Western firms for not leaving Russia after it invaded Ukraine on February 24.

""There are still hundreds of Mariupol residents under the rubble. Despite the shelling, despite all the difficulties, we will continue the rescue work,"" Zelenskiy said in an online video address.

The Ukrainian authorities have not confirmed the number of possible casualties.

""Rescuers are working. There is only this information: 130 people are alive and have been taken out. The rest are waiting for help,"" ombudswoman Denisova said on national television.

The latest: Lyudmyla Denisova, Ukraine's top human rights official, said 130 people had been rescued from the destroyed building as of Friday. That would represent only a small fraction of the over 1,000 people, including children, that city officials said were inside shelters beneath the theater at the time of the strike.

The officials also said earlier this week that rescue operations have been complicated by almost-constant attacks on the city from Russian forces.

What they're saying: ""There are still hundreds of Mariupol residents under the rubble. Despite the shelling, despite all the difficulties, we will continue the rescue work,"" Zelensky said during the address, according to a translation from Reuters.

Days before the bombing, Maxar Technologies had captured the Donetsk Regional Drama Theatre in the port city of Mariupol in a satellite image, which showed the word ""children"" written in Russian in large white letters in front of and behind the theater.

The distinct red-roofed theatre is also relatively far away from other buildings in a park.

The big picture: Russian forces have besieged and indiscriminately bombed civilian buildings — including a children's hospital — in Mariupol for several days, leading to shortages of food, water and medicine.

The International Committee of the Red Cross said Sunday that the city, which was once home to around 430,000 people, faces a ""worst-case scenario"" unless humanitarian corridors can be opened.

The 130 survivors were pulled from the rubble, but there are no updates on the roughly 1,000 others who were believed to be sheltering in a bomb shelter beneath the theater, Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights Lyudmyla Denisova said Friday.

""Rescuers are working. There is only this information: 130 people are alive and have been taken out. The rest are waiting for help,"" Denisova said, according to Reuters. ""According to our data, there are still more than 1,300 people there who are in these basements, in that bomb shelter.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed the number of survivors in an online address Friday, noting that shelling by Russian forces prevented evacuation efforts in the southeastern port city in Ukraine.

OFFICIALS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT SURVIVORS AT BOMBED UKRAINE THEATER

A day before, the Mariupol City Council remained optimistic that many of the civilians who were in the building during the bombing were sheltering underground.

Photos shared of the aftermath show portions of the building completely leveled, with smoke billowing into the air.
