During the speech, delivered virtually to members of Congress in an auditorium on Capitol Hill, Zelenskyy drew a comparison between attacks on the United States and on his democracy and called on the U.S. to institute a no-fly zone over Ukraine.

He’s made the request several times before, but so far American leaders have been reluctant to grant it, citing concerns that American or NATO military pilots enforcing such a restriction on Russian warplanes would lead to a direct confrontation, significantly broadening the war.

“Today, the Ukrainian people are defending not only Ukraine, we are fighting for the values of Europe and the world, sacrificing our lives in the name of the future,” he said.

Zelenskyy began the 18-minute speech speaking Ukrainian, with a translator conveying his message in English. But he transitioned to speaking in English toward the end of the address after playing a two-minute video.

The deeply emotional video first showed peaceful scenes of Ukrainians leading their lives ahead of the war. It then transitioned to gruesome scenes of war, including bodies being added to a mass grave, images of people being treated in a hospital and several scenes of children crying as they evacuated. The video ended with the words “close the sky over Ukraine.”

Maine Sen. Angus King told reporters afterward there was a “collective holding of the breath” in the room and “the fact that he concluded his speech in English was a very powerful moment.”

Biden announces more military aid

Several hours after the address, President Joe Biden announced $800 million in additional U.S. military assistance to Ukraine, saying that he listened to Zelenskyy’s “convincing” speech from the White House private residence.

“He speaks for people who have shown remarkable courage and strength in the face of brutal aggression — courage and strength that’s inspired not only Ukrainians, but the entire world,” Biden said.

Despite Democrats and Republicans alike commending Zelenskyy for his speech and his actions in Ukraine, it wasn’t immediately clear if the United States would shift its stance on the no-fly zone.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday that the administration “continues to believe that a no-fly zone would be escalatory, could prompt a war with Russia.”

“I don’t believe there’s a lot of advocates calling for that at this point in time from Capitol Hill, but we certainly understand and recognize that is still a call from President Zelenskyy,” Psaki continued.

Zelenskyy on Wednesday said that if a no-fly zone was “too much to ask for,” the United States should supply Ukraine with the S-300 missile system, airplanes and other weapons to help Ukrainians defend themselves from Russian attacks.

Using the words of the “I Have a Dream” speech by Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Zelenskyy said: “I have a dream. These words are known to each of you. Today, I can say I have a need. I need to protect our sky. I need your decision, your help, which means exactly the same, the same you feel when you hear the words ‘I have a dream.’”

Zelenskyy closed out the speech speaking directly to Biden, even though Biden was not present for the virtual address.

“As the leader of my nation, I’m addressing President Biden. You are the leader of the nation, of your great nation. I wish you to be the leader of the world. Being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace. Thank you. Slava Ukraini.”

The words mean, “Glory to Ukraine.”

Biden said during his speech that “at the request of President Zelenskyy” the U.S. has “identified and are helping Ukraine acquire additional longer-range, anti-aircraft systems and munitions for those systems.”

Biden also announced the U.S. would send the Ukrainian military 9,000 anti-armor systems, including “shoulder mounted missiles that Ukrainian forces have been using with great effect to destroy invading tanks and armored vehicles”; 7,000 small arms, including grenade launchers and machine guns; and 800 anti-aircraft systems “to make sure the Ukrainian military can continue to stop the planes and helicopters that have been attacking their people and to defend their Ukrainian airspace”; and drones, which demonstrates America’s “commitment to sending our most cutting edge systems to Ukraine for its defense.”

The United States and allied democracies, Biden said, would continue to send Ukraine more weapons and assistance in the future.

“I want to be honest with you, this could be a long and difficult battle. But the American people will be steadfast in our support of the people of Ukraine,” Biden said.

Congress reacts

Zelenskyy’s remarks had barely ended by the time lawmakers began reacting on Twitter. Members of both parties said they were moved by Zelenskyy’s speech and the video, and pledged to help Ukraine fight the war.

Many were nonspecific about how the United States should aid Ukraine.

“I was moved by the remarks of President Zelenskyy this morning,” Virginia Democrat and Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner tweeted. “Virginia stands with Ukraine as they navigate the terror of this senseless invasion.”

Others called for more targeted actions, including providing the military tools Zelenskyy requested.

“The Biden administration must respond with more lethal assistance, including the airplanes, anti-air weapons, and tightened sanctions immediately,” Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican who co-chairs the Senate Ukraine Caucus, tweeted. “If they won’t, then Congress must again act in a bipartisan way with more help.”

“We need to do everything possible to #StandWithUkraine,” Arizona’s U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego, a Democrat, said. “We can only avoid using troops if we are willing to arm them to the teeth with every conventional weapon available. We need to again be the Arsenal of Democracy.”

“@ZelenskyyUa is David taking on Goliath, but he needs more than slingshots,” Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., posted, using Zelenskyy’s Twitter handle. “The Biden Administration should move immediately to provide him and the Ukrainian people with the necessary equipment to defend their country.”

His fellow Florida Republican, Michael Waltz, was more succinct.

“Send the damn MiGs,” Waltz wrote, referring to a type of fighter jet.

Another Florida Republican, Sen. Rick Scott, called for sending planes and adding economic deterrents.

“We must give @Ukraine the planes they need to fight, stop Russian trade & implement the most severe sanctions on ALL Russian politicians to cut off these tyrants,” Scott said.

Some members also named Russian President Vladimir Putin as the aggressor.

“This morning, President Zelenskyy addressed Congress to update us on Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked and evil attack on innocent Ukrainians,” Kansas Republican Rep. Jake LaTurner tweeted. “I appreciate his leadership & willingness to stand up and fight for freedom.”

Noting she was moved by Zelenskyy’s courage, Sen. Debbie Stabenow lauded recent efforts to provide humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine, as well as the administration’s sanctions.

“President Biden and Congress must continue to do everything we can to help them defend their people and their democracy,” the Michigan Democrat said. “That includes the billions in essential aid just passed in the recent appropriations bill for military assistance to strengthen Ukraine’s air defense capabilities and critical humanitarian assistance. And it includes continuing to hit Putin and his oligarchs where they feel it most — in their bank accounts.”

Although there was a bipartisan consensus that the U.S. should provide more aid to Ukraine, partisan bickering continued.

Some Republican members blamed Biden for not acting fast enough.

“Russia invading Ukraine shouldn’t surprise the Biden-Harris administration,” Florida Republican Rep. Byron Donalds said. “Anyone who was paying attention saw this coming. Unfortunately, Biden is leading from behind, which has worsened the situation. We need to accelerate more support for Ukraine, starting with MiGs.”

Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, said House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy targeted the wrong world leader in remarks following Zelenskyy’s address.

“Leaving President Zelenskyy’s speech was sickening to hear GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy attacking, not Putin, but” Biden, Van Hollen said on Twitter. “Somebody needs to tell him who the real enemy is & to stop playing politics with the defense of freedom in Ukraine. We’re all in this together.”

McCarthy, of California, told reporters he’d advised Biden to provide weapons to Ukraine and implement economic sanctions earlier.",https://missouriindependent.com/2022/03/16/zelenskyy-reminds-congress-of-pearl-harbor-and-9-11-in-pleading-for-u-s-help-for-ukraine/

""Nobody knows whether it may have already started. And what is the possibility of this war if Ukraine will fall, in case Ukraine will? It's very hard to say,"" Zelenskyy said during an interview with NBC News Wednesday. ""And we've seen this 80 years ago, when the Second World War had started ... nobody would be able to predict when the full-scale war would start.""

The Ukrainian leader's comments come as he has urged the U.S. and other NATO countries to provide more assistance to Ukraine, with some being reluctant to do so in fear that it could spark an escalation with Russia that could lead to world war.

Zelenskyy has called for a no fly-zone over Ukraine, invoking Martin Luther King Jr. to make the case during his address to Congress.

""I have a dream. ... I can say, I have a need, a need to protect our sky,"" he said. ""I need your decision, your help, which means exactly the same, the same you feel when you hear the words 'I have a dream.'""

Russia calls Council of Europe a ‘Russophobic’ tool of the West

Russia’s outspoken foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, has accused the Council of Europe of being a “Russophobic” instrument serving Western interests.

The pan-European rights body expelled Russia on Wednesday after more than a quarter of a century of membership.

“Due to the Westerners’ Russophobic activity”, the Council of Europe is losing its reason for being, Zakharova said in a statement.

“By placing the service of the bloc’s interests above its own statutory objectives, the Council of Europe has been turned into an obedient instrument of the European Union, NATO and their satellites,” she added.

Russia claims progress in talks with Kyiv on a neutral Ukraine

Russia’s top negotiator at talks with Ukraine has said that Moscow and Kyiv had brought their positions “as close as possible” on a proposal for Ukraine to become a neutral state.

The Kremlin on Wednesday said that a neutral Ukraine along the lines of Sweden or Austria was being discussed at talks with Kyiv to end three weeks of a Russian military operation there.

But Ukraine rejected the proposal and said it wanted its security to be guaranteed by international forces.

“The topic of neutral status and Ukraine’s non-accession to NATO is one of the key points of the talks, this is the point on which the parties brought their positions as close as possible,” Russia’s lead negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said on Friday, cited by Russian news agencies.

Putin accuses Ukraine of ‘war crimes’ in Macron call

Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused Kyiv of “war crimes” in a call with his French counterpart, saying that Moscow was doing “everything possible” to avoid civilian deaths in Ukraine.

“Attention was drawn to the numerous war crimes committed daily by the Ukrainian security forces,” the Kremlin said of the call between Putin and Emmanuel Macron.

“In particular massive rocket and artillery attacks on the cities of Donbas,” the Kremlin added, referring to Ukraine’s Russian-speaking east, part of which is controlled by pro-Moscow separatists.

Putin told Macron the Russian army was “doing everything possible to safeguard the lives of peaceful civilians, including by organising humanitarian corridors for their safe evacuation,” the Kremlin said.

Both leaders also discussed the continuing talks between Moscow and Kyiv to end the conflict in Ukraine in the telephone call, which was a “French initiative”, it said.

UN: 6.5 million displaced inside Ukraine due to war

The UN migration agency estimates that nearly 6.5 million people have now been displaced inside Ukraine, on top of the 3.2 million refugees who have already fled the country.

The estimates from the International Organisation for Migration suggests Ukraine is fast on a course in just three weeks towards the levels of displacement from Syria’s devastating war – which has driven about 13 million people from their homes both in the country and abroad.

The findings come in a paper issued by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. It cited the IOM figures as “a good representation of the scale of internal displacement in Ukraine — calculated to stand at 6.48 million internally displaced persons in Ukraine as of March 16”.

Russia is using the UN Security Council to spread disinformation and propaganda about its invasion of Ukraine, six Western members states have said.

They made the allegation at a council meeting called at Russia’s request to discuss its allegations that Ukraine is developing biological weapons.

“Russia is once again attempting to use this council to launder its disinformation, spread its propaganda, and justify its unprovoked and brutal attack on Ukraine,” the six countries with seats on the council said in a statement read out by US ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield.

US targets Abramovich plane, 99 others over Russia export violations

The US Department for Commerce will move to effectively ground 100 aeroplanes that have recently flown to Russia and are believed to violate US export controls, including a plane used by Russian businessman Roman Abramovich, officials have told Reuters.

The list, seen by Reuters, includes 99 Boeing aeroplanes operated by Russian passenger and cargo carriers including Aeroflot, AirBridge Cargo, Utair, Nordwind, Azur Air and Aviastar-TU – as well as Abramovich’s Gulfstream G650 – and could further hinder Russian efforts to continue some international flights.

The Department of Commerce will warn companies and other entities around the world that any refueling, maintenance, repair, or spare parts or services violate US export controls and subject companies to US enforcement actions that could include “substantial jail time, fines, loss of export privileges, or other restrictions”, the department said.

The department said in a statement the action means “international flights from Russia on these aircraft are effectively grounded”.

Pope asserts Ukraine right to defence in blasting Russia war

Roman Catholic Pope Francis has denounced the “perverse abuse of power” on display in Russia’s war in Ukraine and called for aid to Ukrainians who he said had been attacked in their “identity, history and tradition” and were “defending their land.”

Francis’s comments, in a message to a gathering of European Catholic representatives, marked some of his strongest yet in asserting Ukraine’s right to exist as a sovereign state and to defend itself against Russia’s invasion.

It came just days after Francis told the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, that the concept of a “just war” was obsolete since wars are never justifiable and that pastors must preach peace, not politics.

Nothing suggests Putin’s intent has altered over Ukraine

“I’ve seen nothing which suggests that the original intent of Putin has significantly altered,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

“Therefore … the difference between what was planned, what is being executed is at the moment, one of timing and they have failed to achieve their objectives in the time that they set out in their original objectives and their original plan.”

Ukraine war ups pressure for US oil; industry faces hurdles

In the oil fields of northern Montana, industry veteran Mac McDermott has watched crude prices whipsaw from $75 a barrel in January to more than $120 as Russia pressed its war in Ukraine, then down again when coronavirus worries in China raised the spectre of a global slowdown.

McDermott said his family-owned company will modestly increase drilling if oil prices stabilise. But for the next few months, he’s waiting on the sidelines and struggling to get enough workers to watch over roughly 100 oil wells the company operates. That includes some wells idled during the pandemic that he’s been trying to bring online since last year.

President Joe Biden’s move to ban Russian oil imports over its invasion of Ukraine was met with Republican demands to boost US production to address high petrol prices.

“By ignoring RT’s completely clean record of four consecutive years and stating purely political reasons tied directly to the situation in Ukraine and yet completely unassociated to RT’s operations, structure, management or editorial output, Ofcom has falsely judged RT to not be ‘fit and proper’ and in doing so robbed the UK public of access to information.”

Latest Western arms supplies for Ukraine ‘not escalatory’: Analyst

Richard Weitz, a defence and military analyst with Wikistrat in Washington, DC, says the latest weapons supplies pledged for Ukraine by the US and other Western countries do not amount to an escalation.

“The weapons under discussion are the same that Western powers have been providing the Ukrainian armed forces for months, anti-air missiles, anti-tank and armour missiles, other types of light weapons. The S-300 systems that the Slovaks may provide are already in the Ukrainian inventory, and Russia has more advanced S-400 and S-500 systems,” he told Al Jazeera.

“So it seems to me, this is in line with what the alliance has been doing, providing the Ukrainians with the weapons and the munitions they need to replenish the stocks they have lost and take advantage of Russian tactical errors. But it’s not an escalatory move.”

US pushing China to pressure Russia to end war: AJE correspondent

Al Jazeera’s Rosiland Jordan has said the Biden administration is ramping up its public pressure campaign on China, urging the country to exert influence on Putin to end the invasion.

So far, China has taken what it describes as a neutral stance on the war, as it largely shies away from intervening in the affairs of other nations, Jordan reported from Washington.

“They have this ‘don’t meddle’ policy,” she said. “But the US is trying to pressure Beijing into actually taking a stand – not just a legal stand, but a moral stand, as well.”

A spokesperson for the UN’s child agency, UNICEF, has said at least 5,000 children have been born into the conflict raging in Ukraine.

“The children of Ukraine need peace urgently and they need it now,” English added.

Why Security Council will not vote on Russia’s ‘humanitarian’ draft resolution

Al Jazeera’s Kristen Saloomey, reporting from the UN, said Ukraine’s ambassador delivered “an impassioned response” at the Security Council to Russia’s denial that it is the aggressor in the conflict.

Russia had put forward a humanitarian resolution that was expected to come up for a vote on Friday, Saloomey explained, but Moscow said it would no longer bring that measure to a vote.

“It was clear the US was not going to back that without wording in that resolution acknowledging that the reason for the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding there is the Russians’ aggression,” she said.

Friday’s meeting will still take place, she said, but the focus will be on Russia’s allegation of US-backed biological laboratories in Ukraine – a claim the US, Ukraine and other allies have rejected.

The House’s 428-8 vote sends the bill, requested by President Biden, to the Senate for likely approval as soon as next week.

‘War is causing suffering well beyond Ukraine’s borders,’ says UK envoy

British Ambassador to the UN Barbara Woodward has called on Russia to end the war, saying that the conflict is causing suffering worldwide, not just in Ukraine.

“President Putin’s war is causing suffering well beyond Ukraine’s borders,” Woodward told the UN Security Council.

“Thousands of students – many from nations around this table – have been caught up in the violence. The war is spiking food and energy prices, bringing further pain to countries in the developing world already suffering from the impact of COVID and famine and conflict and climate. Millions of refugees have been taken in by countries across Europe.”

Blinken accuses Russia of committing ‘war crimes’

The US Secretary of State has accused Russia of committing war crimes in Ukraine, echoing Biden, who on Wednesday called Putin a “war criminal”.

“Intentionally targeting civilians is a war crime. After all the destruction of the past three weeks I find it difficult to conclude that the Russians are doing otherwise,” Blinken told reporters.

Still, Blinken said US State Department experts are in the process of documenting and evaluating potential war crimes to help international efforts towards accountability.

""He is a war criminal,"" Mr Biden told reporters at the White House.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the President was ""speaking from his heart"" after seeing images on television of ""barbaric actions by a brutal dictator through his invasion of a foreign country"".

The White House had previously been hesitant to declare Putin's actions those of a war criminal, saying it was a legal term that required research.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Mr Biden's comments were ""unacceptable and unforgivable rhetoric"".

The US President also announced $800 million of new assistance for Ukraine including 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems, 100 grenade launchers and an unspecified number of drones.

In a televised address at the Annual Friends of Ireland Luncheon in Washington, Mr Biden said Putin is paying a “big price for his aggression”.

Until Wednesday, the Biden administration had avoided calling Putin a war criminal to preserve the chance of negotiating an end to the war with Moscow.

But in an off-the-cuff remark on Wednesday night, the US president responded to a reporter's question by saying: ""I think he is a war criminal.""

Mr Biden will hold a call on Friday with Chinese leader Xi Jinping as Washington piles pressure on China to not support Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a step that would dramatically widen the gulf between Beijing and Western governments.
