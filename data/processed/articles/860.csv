Incredible video footage has emerged showing the moment a lone Ukrainian tank single-handedly destroyed several Russian armoured vehicles less than 50 miles from Kyiv.

The footage, collected by a drone and published by a Ukrainian volunteer unit on Telegram, shows what appears to be a single well-positioned Ukrainian T-64 tank ambushing a convoy of Russian BTR-82A armoured vehicles on a road in Nova Basan, west of the capital.

Thanks to brilliant positioning, the lion-hearted tank operator was able to fire several rounds at the invaders' convoy, threading the gap between other structures from a concealed location behind a house.

One BTR was quickly set ablaze in the attack, prompting the remaining armoured vehicles to fire back, seemingly aiming at other targets off-camera as yellow flashes of fire were seen streaking across the fields surrounding the road.

But the T-64 appeared unsighted and continued to pound the convoy with shells as it outsmarted the Russian troops until further artillery reinforcements arrived.

The second half of the video cuts to later footage of Ukrainian artillery strikes raining down on the convoy as it attempts to flee, before zooming in on the wreckage of a Russian tank still on fire alongside several corpses.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian soldiers have used one of Moscow's captured thermobaric weapons against Russian troops.

They fired the feared 'blazing sun' TOS-1A rocket launcher near Izyum in eastern Ukraine. The 'vacuum bombs' suck in oxygen from the target area, creating a blast that can destroy internal organs. They are illegal to use against civilians, but are lawful against military targets

Despite the heroics of the Ukrainian army, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg today warned the war in Ukraine could last 'months, even years' as there is no sign Vladimir Putin has lost 'his ambition to control the whole country'.

Ukrainian authorities urged civilians in the country's east to flee 'now' or 'risk death' as Russian forces regroup ahead of what is expected to be a fresh offensive in the Donbas region.



Stoltenberg, speaking ahead of a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels, said the international community should be 'realistic' about Moscow's intentions and 'realise that this may last for a long time' as the war entered its 41st day.

'We need also to be prepared for the long haul, both when it comes to supporting Ukraine, sustaining sanctions and strengthening our defences,' he added.

Victims 'blown up with a grenade', a father shot dead in front of his 14-year-old son and troops who 'executed all men under 50': Horrifying details emerge of Russian atrocities in Bucha By Jack Newman and Chris Pleasance for MailOnline Charred body parts lay scattered over the streets of Bucha for days after a man was killed with a grenade, while men were stripped naked, tied up and summarily executed by Russians, traumatised civilians have revealed as vile stories emerge from the Ukrainian town. Survivors from the month-long occupation of the town in Kyiv oblast have started to describe their gruesome treatment at the hands of Putin's invading troops after area was liberated. Mykola, a 53-year-old resident, spent a month hiding in the cold and dark cellar of his apartment building with his wife after witnessing callous executions on the streets of his hometown. He told ABC that when the Russians arrived, they killed all men aged under 50 and then ordered him to bury his friends within 20 minutes. Two of his friends were shot in front of him and another was hit by a grenade, blowing his body to pieces, which lay untouched for days until Mykola was allowed to quickly gather his parts in a bag and bury them in a shallow grave to ward off the dogs. Vanya Skyba told The Economist how Russians rounded up a group of builders, ordered them to strip naked and lie face down on the floor while their bodies and phones were searched for evidence of military tattoos or anti-Russian sentiment. One of the men was killed as an example to make the group talk, forcing one of the men to admit he had been a member of Ukraine's territorial defence who had served in the Donbas, prompting the Kremlin thugs to execute him too. The others were beaten and tortured until an order to kill was issued by a Russian saying: 'F***ing do them in.' They were led to the side of the building and each shot, and Skyba took a bullet in the side which went through his body. He played dead on the concrete floor until he heard silence when he fled over a fence to a nearby home. He was later found there by Russians from a different unit who believed his cover story he was the owner of the home, but they led him back to the cellar where he had been shot where he sheltered with a dozens woman and children until they were freed. After the savage killings, locals said Putin's army occupied the dead civilians' homes, drinking their alcohol, partying and stealing their belongings. Advertisement

The date of the ambush was not given, but it is thought to have taken place last week, given that the majority of Russian forces retreated from towns and villages around Kyiv late last week and over the weekend.

Geolocation shows the ambush took place along the HO7 highway which runs through Nova Basan, connecting Kyiv with the Western cities of Sumy and Kharkiv.

Meanwhile, images published on April 1 showed Ukrainian soldiers inspecting a series of burnt-out Russian tanks and BTRs in Nova Basan, which may well have been the remnants of the effective ambush.

The Ukrainian tank managed to operate incredibly effectively against the Russian armour, despite the considerable discrepancy in their technology.

The T-64 is a Soviet-era machine, first deployed as early as the 1960s, and Ukraine inherited thousands of the vehicles when the Soviet Union collapsed.

Armoured vehicle technology has since moved on massively - the Russian BTRs that were destroyed in the clip only entered service a decade ago - but Ukraine still relies heavily on the ageing tanks as the bulk of its military might.

Images published in January less than a month prior to the Russian invasion showed scores of T-64 tanks left out in the snow, waiting to be retrofitted with upgraded armour and weapons at a tank repair plant in Kharkiv.

The footage of the daring ambush emerged as Ukrainian authorities claim Russia's death toll in the war is nearing 20,000.

Ukraine's armed forces are continuing to push back invading Kremlin troops and retake 'key terrain' around the capital and other eastern cities, while Putin's forces retreat to refocus their efforts on the Donbas.

In an intelligence update posted yesterday, Britain's MoD said that due to the scale of the damage, many of Russian units 'are likely to require significant re-equipping and refurbishment before being available to redeploy for operations in eastern Ukraine.'

However, Russian forces are continuing to conduct brutal bombing campaigns in cities like Mariupol where the civilian death toll has risen to 5,000.

Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said that even though Ukraine is taking back the capital, he urged civilians not to return for 'at least another week', with explosives left around the city, and described the situation in east of Ukraine as 'critical'.

Elsewhere, Ukraine's general staff said Russia has again used banned cluster munitions in Mykolaiv, targeting civilian buildings including a children hospital in a horrific attack which has killed 11 and wounded 61.

As the Czech Republic became the first bloc member to send tanks and armoured infantry vehicles to Kyiv on Thursday, NATO's foreign ministers met today to discuss sending more arms to Ukraine after it emerged the EU had sent just £1bn in aid to President Zelensky's troops since the invasion began on February 24.

Members of the trans-Atlantic alliance had until today given Ukraine only anti-tank and anti-craft missiles, small arms and protective equipment, but not offered heavy armour or fighter jets.

Today's delivery is understood to be a gift agreed on by NATO allies, raising fears the bloc could be dragged into the Russian war in Ukraine despite remaining on the sidelines for more than a month.

Stoltenberg also confirmed that some members of the alliance had sent heavy weaponry to Ukraine following reports the Czech Republic had supplied Soviet-era tanks to Kyiv.

'Since the invasion allies have stepped up their support. I also expect that ministers when they meet today and tomorrow will discuss how they can further support Ukraine,' he said, declining to give details.

'I can say that the totality of what allies are doing is significant and that includes also some heavier systems combined with lighter systems.'

President Joe Biden has in recent weeks ordered more US troops to NATO's eastern flank to reassure edgy allies and pledged to protect the bloc's territory if Russian forces stray over more borders.

Ukraine's deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk today said in a message on Telegram that residents of the country's eastern regions should evacuate 'now' or 'risk death' due to a feared Russian attack.

'The governors of the Kharkiv, Lugansk and Donetsk regions are calling on the population to leave these territories and are doing everything to ensure that the evacuations take place in an organised manner,' she said.

The call for urgent evacuations comes as Ukraine says Russian forces are regrouping to launch a fresh offensive in the country's east after retreating from the Kyiv region.

Vereshchuk asked residents to cooperate with authorities, saying Kyiv will 'not be able to help' them after an attack.

'It has to be done now because later people will be under fire and face the threat of death. There is nothing they will be able to do about it, nor will we be able to help,' she said.

'It is necessary to evacuate as long as this possibility exists. For now, it still exists,' she added.

Russian forces last week pulled back from positions outside Kyiv and shifted the focus of their assault away from the capital, and Ukraine's general staff said the northeastern city of Kharkiv, the country's second-largest, also remained under attack.

Authorities in the eastern region of Luhansk on Wednesday urged residents to get out 'while it is safe' from an area that Ukraine also expects to be the target of a new offensive.

The Kremlin has declared that Ukraine's Donbas is now a priority for the Russian army. NATO believes Moscow aims to take control of the whole Donbas region in eastern Ukraine with the aim of creating a corridor from Russia to annexed Crimea.

First NATO country sends tanks to Ukraine: Czech Republic provides T-72 tanks and armoured infantry vehicles following Zelensky's plea for help

By Lauren Lewis for MailOnline

The Czech Republic has become the first NATO country to send tanks to Ukraine, providing T-72 and armoured infantry vehicles following President Zelensky's plea for help.

Several BVP-1 infantry fighting vehicles, howitzer artillery pieces and more than a dozen T-72 tanks were yesterday loaded on a train bound for Slovakia where they are expected to head on to Ukraine, footage run by public broadcaster Czech Television showed.

The delivery is understood to be a gift agreed on by NATO allies, raising fears the trans-Atlantic bloc could be dragged into the Russian war in Ukraine despite remaining on the sidelines for more than a month.

NATO leaders have so far given Ukraine anti-tank and anti-craft missiles as well as small arms and protective equipment, but have not offered any heavy armour or fighter jets. Prague's decision to supply tanks to Kyiv will pile pressure on NATO allies to follow suit.

It comes as Russian artillery continued to pound the Ukrainian cities of Mariupol and Kharkiv today as the West prepared more sanctions against Moscow in response to civilian killings that Kyiv and its allies have called war crimes.

NATO is set to discuss the delivery of more weapons to Ukraine at a meeting today and tomorrow, according to Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, but the US is widely expected to reject most demands over fears NATO could be pulled into the war

What is the T-72 battle tank? First made in Russia, the T-72 is staple of eastern European militaries and is owned by the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Bulgaria. Most of these are the T-72M standard model, which are slightly behind Russia's updated T-72B3 versions that have been used in Ukraine. The Czech Republic has ordered 35 tanks upgraded to T-72M4 CZ, giving the tank a comprehensive upgrade in every aspect and costing more than $5million per tank. It is understood the tanks Prague has sent to Ukraine are not the T-72M4 but have undergone some local modifications. Crew: Three people Main gun: 125 mm smoothbore Anti-tank guided missile: 9M119 Svir or 9M119M Refleks Machine guns: 1 x 7.62 mm, 1 x 12.7 mm Weight: 45 tons Length (including gun): 9.53 metres Width: 3.46 metres Height: 2.2 metres Top speed: 37 to 47mph Advertisement

Czech Defence Minister Jana Cernochova told parliament yesterday: 'I will only assure you that the Czech Republic is helping Ukraine as much as it can and will continue to help by [supplying] military equipment, both light and heavy.'

She declined to provide further details on the transfer but it comes after Ukraine's Vlodymyr Zelensky demanded NATO deliver armour, fighter jets and other military equipment during a summit in Brussels on March 24.

Ukraine burns through in a single day the same amount of weaponry it receives in a week, according to a senior Polish official, and Kyiv's eastern neighbours are concerned with keeping up with demand, the Wall Street Journal reported.

The Czech delivery has been funded by Prague as well as private donors who have contributed to a crowdsourced fundraising campaign to supply arms to Kyiv.

Prague, and neighbouring Slovakia which has no tanks to give, are also considering helping repair and refit damaged Ukrainian military equipment. Germany will send several dozen infantry fighting vehicles to Kyiv and the UK has approved the delivery of 20 ambulances.

NATO is set to discuss the delivery of more weapons to Ukraine at a meeting today and tomorrow, according to Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.

But western officials on Monday suggested the Biden administration in Washington would act as a throttle on plans to supply more equipment to Ukraine, over fears that the war machines could breach rules allowing only defensive weapons to be supplied.

One said that the US was 'not minded' to support the supply of T-72 tanks of the type used by Ukraine from sympathetic neighbours, adding: 'They have this offensive dimension, they are not purely defensive. They would not be particularly relevant to the military activities the Ukrainians need to undertake.'

A proposal to transfer 28 MiG jets from Poland to Ukraine via the US last month was scrapped amid NATO concerns about getting drawn into conflict with Russia.

Finland and Sweden would be welcomed into NATO if they applied to join, Secretary-General Stoltenberg says – as Russia warns of retaliation Finland and Sweden would be welcomed into NATO if they applied to join, the head of the alliance has said today, in what would be a major blow for Russia amid Vladimir Putin's faltering invasion of Ukraine. Jens Stoltenberg, NATO general secretary, told a news conference that the 30-member alliance would work to overcome 'security concerns' between the countries applying to join and being ratified - amid fears Russia would retaliate. He spoke after Finland's prime minister Sanna Marin said her country could take a decision on joining the alliance within weeks and polls in Sweden also showed a majority of people support membership. If either country opts to join the alliance, it would mark an historic reconstruction of European security architecture that has held since the end of the Second World War. Finland, which fought a short but bloody conflict with the Soviets in the build-up to World War Two, has been officially neutral since signing a pact in 1948. As part of the pact, Finland agreed never to join a military alliance viewed as hostile to Russia, never to allow its territory to be used for an attack against Russia, and to maintain an armed forces for self-defence purposes only. In return, the country - which shares an 830-mile border with Russia - was given guarantees by Moscow that it would not be attacked. Advertisement

NATO has already supplied fuel, ammunition, helmets, protective gear and medical supplies to Ukraine, Stoltenberg said yesterday. The discussions come despite the bloc's desperate efforts to avoid being dragged into Putin's war in Ukraine.

President Joe Biden has in recent weeks ordered more US troops to NATO's eastern flank to reassure edgy allies and pledged to protect the bloc's territory if Russian forces stray over more borders.

A visibly angry Zelensky on March 26 demanded that Western nations hand over military hardware that was 'gathering dust' in stockpiles, saying Ukraine needed just one per cent of NATO's aircraft and one per cent of its tanks.

Zelensky accused the West of holding back on supplies because of 'intimidation' from Moscow and suggested Russia is in charge of NATO.

And in a late night address on Saturday, Zelensky said: 'We need more ammunition. We've already been waiting 31 days. What is NATO doing?

'Who is in charge of the Euro-Atlantic community? Is it really still Moscow, because of intimidation? We are asking for one per cent of what NATO has, nothing more.'

'If only those who have been thinking for 31 days on how to hand over dozens of jets and tanks had one per cent of their courage,' Zelensky said as he praised his troops' efforts.

Russia's constant artillery barrages and aerial bombing are reducing Ukrainian cities to rubble, killing thousands of people and driving millions to flee their homes.

Russian artillery pounded the Ukrainian cities of Mariupol and Kharkiv today as the West prepared more sanctions against Moscow in response to civilian killings that Kyiv and its allies have called war crimes.

The besieged southern port of Mariupol has been under almost constant bombardment since the early days of the invasion that began on Feb. 24, trapping tens of thousands of residents without food, water or power.

'The humanitarian situation in the city is worsening,' British military intelligence said. 'Most of the 160,000 remaining residents have no light, communication, medicine, heat or water. Russian forces have prevented humanitarian access, likely to pressure defenders to surrender.'

Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said authorities would try to evacuate trapped civilians through 11 humanitarian corridors today, though people trying to leave the besieged city of Mariupol would have to use their own vehicles.

Russian forces last week pulled back from positions outside Kyiv and shifted the focus of their assault away from the capital, and Ukraine's general staff said the northeastern city of Kharkiv, the country's second-largest, also remained under attack.

Authorities in the eastern region of Luhansk on Wednesday urged residents to get out 'while it is safe' from an area that Ukraine also expects to be the target of a new offensive.

Western sanctions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, described as a 'special military operation' by Moscow and the biggest assault on a European nation since World War Two, gained new impetus this week when dead civilians shot at close range were found in the northern town of Bucha after it was retaken from Russian forces.

Moscow denied targeting civilians there and called the evidence presented a forgery staged by the West to discredit it.

Speaking a day after the European Union announced new sanctions, including a ban on Russian coal imports and denying Russian ships access to EU ports, the head of the EU executive, Ursula von der Leyen, said there was more to come.

'These sanctions will not be our last sanctions,' she told European Parliament on Wednesday. 'Now we have to look into oil and revenues Russia gets from fossil fuels.'

Europe gets about a third of its natural gas from Russia and has been wary of the economic impact of the total ban on Russian energy imports advocated by Ukraine, but Von der Leyen's remarks signal the bloc's strengthening resolve to take the step that Kyiv says is vital to securing a deal to end the war.

The White House said it would also unveil new sanctions today, in part in response to Bucha. The new sanctions, coordinated between Washington, the Group of Seven advanced economies and the EU, will target Russian banks and officials and ban new investment in Russia, the White House said.

After an impassioned address to the UN Security Council on Tuesday, Zelensky said new sanctions against Russia 'must be commensurate with the gravity of the occupiers' war crimes,' calling it a 'crucial moment' for Western leaders.

Ukrainian officials say between 150 and 300 bodies might be in a mass grave by a church in Bucha, north of the capital Kyiv. Satellite images taken weeks ago show bodies of civilians on a street in the town, a private US company said.

Reuters reporters saw at least four victims shot through the head in Bucha, one with their hands tied behind their back. Residents have recounted cases of several others slain, some shot through their eyes and one apparently beaten to death and mutilated.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10692495/Incredible-moment-single-Ukrainian-tank-takes-entire-Russian-convoy-near-Kyiv.html

It will be a little while before the picture becomes definitive, but Moscow’s forces are now fast retreating out of the country from the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy districts, Ukrainian regional officials say.

It is impossible to describe this as anything other than a serious reverse. Such is the haste of the exit that some units are being left behind to be mopped up by the Ukrainians. Sumy, a little over 30km from the Russian border, did not fall to the invaders, while the road to Chernihiv, which was at risk of encirclement, is now open to the capital to the south-west.

Kyiv too can breathe again: the month of danger has passed and the full withdrawal means that the capital is no longer in range of artillery fire – although it can still be struck by missiles from Belarus, if the Russians bloodymindedly choose to launch them. And, while it may appear that a re-invasion could happen again at any time, the reality is that unless something dramatic happens elsewhere it cannot succeed.

Russia’s problem is that its forces have taken significant losses from its overoptimistic, poorly planned multi-front attack. The number killed could be anywhere from 7,000 to 15,000, with wounded typically double that, from an invasion force of about 140,000. As Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the US Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote last week, it could be that Russia has lost “about a quarter of its initial combat force”.

Other estimates from western officials have suggested Russian combat effectiveness may be depleted by a fifth or a sixth, not as high perhaps but still operationally significant. The haste of the retreat acknowledges that the invaders are in many respects exhausted and need to concentrate operations, fighting street by street to take Mariupol in the south and a more conventional military campaign in the Donbas region, where Ukraine’s forces are dug in.

What will happen here is less certain. Russia still has the ability and desire to attack, and its forces are pressing south of Izyum, a key strategic point, to try to envelop the Ukrainian army that faces the separatist Donetsk and Luhansk territories to the east. But it appears its forces are having less success advancing north to join up from Velyka Novosilka, 100km north of Mariupol. And after nearly seven weeks of intense fighting, it is not at all certain Russia can keep up the effort.

“If Russia wants to push back Ukraine’s defenders near Donetsk and Luhansk, they will have to force them out of defensive positions Ukraine has had five more years to prepare. It will require heavy artillery support and a use of combined arms – infantry, tanks, artillery, air power – that we have not seen so far,” said Ben Barry, a land warfare specialist from the International Institute for Strategic Studies.

Ukraine says some Russian forces, brought up as reinforcements, are refusing to fight. On Sunday, its general staff said two battalions of Russian forces from South Ossetia, the breakaway region of Georgia, “refused to participate in combat” in Ukraine and would return to base. Although this cannot be verified for certain, there are enough reports of desertions and poor morale to believe Russian combat effectiveness is massively reduced – against an enemy determined to fight for its homeland.

Meanwhile, mercenaries from the Russian Wagner Group – whose number has been estimated at 1,000 – have been photographed in Donetsk. But these are no replacement for well-trained regular forces: Wagner forces have, for example, struggled in countries such as Mozambique, where they briefly tried to battle an insurgency in the Muslim north in 2019.

Ukraine will recognise the nature of the war has changed. Its supply lines, in particular weapons from the west, have become less fraught. But despite limited counter offensives, there is no sign its forces have the capability to push back the Russian forces where they have made gains in the east and the south. Calls for jets and tanks have gone unheeded, although Australia has promised to send Bushmaster armoured personnel carriers, which will help with mobility.

If Russia chooses to dig in, then the military balance – which typically favours the defender on a 3-1 ratio – is reversed. If its forces can complete the bloody recapture of Mariupol, the invaders will control the south between Crimea and the occupied Donbas – and with Odesa blockaded, ensure Ukraine has no access to the sea.

Ukraine has not been defeated, although it faces a fight on its hands in the Donbas. But without a change on the battlefield it may once again be partitioned de facto, against its will.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/04/routing-of-russian-forces-from-kyiv-area-will-be-hard-to-repeat-in-eastern-ukraine
