""Russian forces continue to hold positions to the east and west of Kyiv despite the withdrawal of a limited number of units,"" the U.K. Ministry of Defence said in an intelligence briefing.

Chernihiv is about 90 miles (145 km) north of Kyiv and 40 miles (64 km) south of the Russian border.

A Russian defense official said Wednesday that Moscow would ""drastically"" reduce military activity near Chernihiv and the capital of Kyiv, NBC News reported.

U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken urged caution about believing Moscow's promises. The Russian Defense Ministry's press office was not immediately available to provide comment to CNBC.

The British ministry said heavy fighting ""will likely take place in the suburbs"" of Kyiv in the coming days. Since last week, Ukrainian forces began to report retaking towns close to the capital.

The situation around the capital is fluid, and those Ukrainian claims are difficult or impossible to verify.

""You do see the Ukrainians trying to take advantage of opportunities and roll back the Russians where they can,"" NBC News Global Security Reporter Dan De Luce said.

Heavy fighting continues in Mariupol in the south, but the U.K. Ministry said Ukrainian defenders are still holding the city center. Mariupol has been largely destroyed by Russian artillery and missiles.

The Kharkiv region of northeastern Ukraine has come under heavy shellfire in the past 24 hours, the region's military governor said in a statement Thursday.

The intense bombardment has prevented the opening of evacuation corridors in the region, Oleh Synyehubov, the head of the Kharkiv region military administration, said in a statement on Telegram.

Over the past day, Russian troops have struck 47 times with artillery, mortar, tank, and strikes in the areas of Piatihatky, Oleksiyivka, and the residential area of the Kharkiv Traсtor Plant district,"" Synyehubov said.

""About 380 shellings from Grad and Smerch [rocket artillery] were recorded. In Saltivka, the enemy damaged the gas pipeline, there was a major fire, and rescuers have worked to localize it,"" he added.

Synyehubov said Russian forces had also inflicted heavy fire on Derhachi, northwest of the city of Kharkiv, killing one person and injuring three others, and destroying a city council building.

""The fiercest point [in Kharkiv region] remains Izium, where fighting and constant shelling continue,"" he said. ""We are working every day to open 'green' [evacuation] corridors.

If you are catching up on the latest developments in the Ukraine-Russia conflict, here's what you should know:

From Mariupol: Denis Pushilin, the head of the separatist Donetsk People’s Republic, has ordered the formation of a city administration for the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol, according to a decree published on the DPR head’s website on Thursday, Russian state news agency TASS reported Thursday.

The city is within the boundaries of the Donetsk region of Ukraine. The city was under Ukrainian government control before the war, but the Russian government — which recognized the independence of the DPR in late February — considers the entire region to belong to the separatist republic.

Meanwhile, the evacuation corridor in Mariupol agreed by Ukrainian and Russian officials, announced on Thursday, is “insufficient” to allow the rescue of civilians “in the right conditions,” France said.

Rubles for Russian gas: According to a newly signed decree, gas buyers from ""unfriendly countries"" will need to open and pay from ruble accounts in Russian banks, President Vladimir Putin announced. France, Germany and the UK made statements to say they will not pay for Russian gas in rubles.

Russia withdraws from Chernobyl: The site of the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986 and its surrounding territory fell into the hands of Russian troops in the first week of the war in Ukraine. But in a Telegram post made on Thursday, Energoatom, the state enterprise overseeing Ukraine’s nuclear power plants, said that Russian troops announced their intention to leave and hand over control to Ukrainian personnel. The US is also seeing Russian forces “drawing down” from Chernobyl and from the north and northwest of Kyiv, a senior US defense official told reporters Thursday.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asked the Belgian government to help with “weapons, sanctions, membership of the European Union,"" adding, ""maybe soon the future will pay you back.” By the end of Thursday, Zelensky will have addressed 17 global parliaments in a bid to drum up support during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

NATO secretary-general says Russian troops ""are not withdrawing but repositioning"": Speaking at a news conference in Brussels for the secretary general’s 2021 Annual Report, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that according to intelligence, “Russian units are not withdrawing but repositioning. Russia is trying to regroup, resupply and reinforce its offensive in the Donbas region. At the same time, Russia maintains pressure on Kyiv and other cities ... we can expect additional offensive actions bringing even more suffering,” Stoltenberg said.",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-31-22/h_efc48b8dd85ba4af73e8f402c43e3cf0

Independent military experts point to one possible factor.

They say Russia is firing artillery from tracked vehicles, that can quickly move location once they have fired.

That makes them harder to target.

Ukrainian forces have told us they also are constrained because of the presence of civilians in built-up areas from which Russia is firing.

They don’t want to risk killing their own people while targeting Russian artillery.

This has been an issue in the towns like Bucha, outside Kyiv, where some civilians remained despite the presence of Russian forces.

Around Kyiv, Ukrainian forces have managed to push the Russians back, limiting the scope for them to use artillery.

Because the city centre is out of reach, President Putin’s men have been unable to bombard Kyiv as they have Mariupol, and have resorted to air strikes.

However, Ukrainian air defences have been working well. Several times here in Kyiv we have heard the massive bang when a Russian missile is brought down - sometimes with casualties on the ground.

In general, Ukraine has been pleading for more and better air defence systems to help it curb the Russian threat.

And the constant demand here is for Nato to impose a no-fly zone.

Also, the Chairman of the UN Human Rights Council Federico Villegas announced the establishment of an international independent commission to investigate war crimes in Ukraine. It is due to report on its work in September 2022.

The meeting of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Dmytro Kuleba with the President of Poland Andrzej Duda will take place today.

Humanitarian corridors

The Ukrainian and Russian parties, with the mediation of the International Committee of the Red Cross, agreed on a humanitarian corridor for the evacuation of Mariupol residents. As the Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine Iryna Vereshchuk said this morning, 45 buses will be involved in the evacuation, some of them have already left for Mariupol.

In addition, as of March 31, 2 humanitarian corridors in the Zaporizhzhia region have been agreed upon:

Melitopol – Zaporizhzhia

Enerhodar – Zaporizhzhia

Russia has declared a ceasefire on March 31 starting from 10:00 to evacuate residents from humanitarian corridors. There is no trust in the occupiers, but we hope that today all the announced green corridors will work.

Today, March 31, 2022, there is no evacuation in the Kyiv region. There are no officially agreed-on humanitarian corridors in the region.

Ukraine's talks with Russia

Negotiations between Russia and Ukraine may continue online on April 1. This was announced by Davyd Arakhamia on Ukraine 24 TV channel. According to him, Ukraine expects to develop a draft agreement in a week, which can be discussed by the presidents of the countries.

14:30 – Media reports that Erdogan has announced plans to hold talks with Zelenskyy and Putin. This week, the President of Turkey intends to raise the issue of organizing a quick meeting of the heads of Ukrainian and Russian states.

However, Putin himself believes that the conditions for a ceasefire in Ukraine have not yet been created. At least that's what he told Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi in a telephone conversation. This was announced by Draghi at a press conference on Thursday, the EP reports with reference to Reuters.

Nuclear objects

Russian troops begin to leave the Chornobyl nuclear power plant. This was reported by sources in the Pentagon. So far, only part of the troops has left the station.

The IAEA will send nuclear safety equipment to Ukraine. The IAEA is also organizing several missions to support the Ukrainian side: at the Zaporizhzhya NPP and the Chornobyl NPP, these will be online missions. Other stations will set up emergency teams of experts who will go to the scene in case of threat to ""prevent acts of aggression, as at ZNPP.""

Who's coming to Ukraine?

About financial aid, weapons, and volunteer fighters

The United States has already sent a new batch of weapons to Ukraine. U.S. Department of Defense spokesman John Kirby said on the night of March 31: ""Deliveries are coming to the region every day, including the last 24 hours. We have already shipped the top 50 cargo planes out of about 30 within the $800 million received by the president."" Kirby stressed that the shipments include weapons that Ukrainian forces need most, including anti-tank and anti-aircraft systems.

Norwegian authorities sent 2,000 M72 anti-tank grenade launchers to Ukraine. This decision was made after the speech of the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Norwegian Parliament.

Ukraine will be able to buy weapons from German defense companies. Preliminarily, the purchase of weapons and equipment worth €300 million has already been agreed upon. In total, about 200 items are on the list and some of them will be delivered as soon as possible.

The Spanish government has already sent ten offensive planes to Ukraine. This was stated by Spanish Defense Minister Margarita Robles.

Assistance to refugees

Italy will give Ukrainians who have left their homes a residence permit for one year. In addition, refugees will have access to health care, the labor market, education, and some social benefits. Ukrainians will also be able to receive 300 euros for three months.

News from partners

Lithuania has included Russia and Belarus in the list of hostile countries.

Ambassador of Ukraine to Poland, Andrii Deshchytsia, said that Ukraine was negotiating with Poland on the possibility of completely closing the border with Belarus. According to the ambassador, the diplomatic mission is negotiating with the Polish Ministry of Infrastructure and the Polish government. The primary goal is to close the border with Belarus by 100%. However, even if this decision is not taken at the level of the European Union. Andrii Deshchytsia also stressed that diplomats from Ukraine were discussing similar issues with the Baltic states.

Germany is ready to provide security guarantees to Ukraine, but after the end of hostilities, said German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerboсk.

And this is Denmark playing with the Netherlands. Thank you for your solidarity with the Ukrainian people!

Russian nuclear planes violated Swedish airspace. Sweden believes that this was intimidation.

What's in Russia?

Unrecognized South Ossetia will soon take legal steps to join Russia. Reunification with Russia is the country's strategic goal. This was stated by the President of South Ossetia Bibilov. Prior to that, the leader of the so-called ""LPR"" Leonid Pasichnyk stated the same intentions, but he was told by Russia that ""now is not the time.""

Self-proclaimed Abkhazia abandoned the idea of ​​joining Russia.

Meanwhile, soldiers from South Ossetia refused to ""liberate"" Donbas and returned home. The information was confirmed by the former President of South Ossetia Eduard Kokoity. He said that ""it is not necessary to condemn the military,"" but it is necessary to ""understand the reasons for what happened."" Ossetian blogger Alik Pukhayev also said that 300 servicemen refused to fight voluntarily: ""Today, about 300 servicemen (mostly ethnic Ossetians) from a Russian military base returned to South Ossetia voluntarily because they thought they had been left to die during a 'special operation' in Ukraine,"" he wrote. And rightly so.

13:00 – Georgia reacted to South Ossetia's statement on holding a referendum on joining Russia: ""Talks on a referendum in South Ossetia are unacceptable,"" said the Georgian Foreign Minister.

Putin ""turned on the back"" about paying for gas in rubles. The aggressor country will not require Europeans to pay for gas supplies in rubles. They will be able to pay in euros. This was stated by German government spokesman Steffen Seibert following a telephone conversation between Putin and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

The French Embassy in Russia will start issuing tourist visas in April. From 1 April 2022, it will be possible to apply for all types of visas to France, including tourist visas, without restrictions related to COVID-19. This was reported on the website of the Consulate General of the French Embassy in Russia. It becomes clear why Macron calls Putin every week.

In Russia, there was hysteria over the disqualification of skaters. Russian-titled Russian coach Tatiana Tarasova reacted to the International Skating Union's (ISU) decision to remove Russian figure skaters from competition because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine: ""You should have a conscience. The life of an athlete is very short, and they take it away. Bandits!"" Disrespectful Tarasova, your compatriots, real thugs of the Russian army, are taking the lives of Ukrainians, not figuratively, but literally. But you are unlikely to realize this, so the sanctions will continue to work.

The thief country doesn't return leased aircraft to Europe. AerCap, the world's largest aircraft leasing company, is demanding from insurers about $3.5 billion in compensation for aircraft stuck in Russia, Bloomberg reports. It is noted that the Irish company managed to return only 22 of the 135 aircraft and 3 of the 14 engines installed on Russian aircraft before the ""special operation.""

What about Belarus?

The occupiers are using the airport in Brest, Belarus, to shell Ukraine. The issue of the invasion of Belarusian troops into our country ""went away."" ""The offensive from Belarus is already underway, but not the Belarusian army. Moreover, the Russians have begun to use the Brest airport, from which the shelling of our territories starts,"" said the adviser to the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine Vadym Denisenko.

The second train in three days in Belarus derailed. It was equipped with Russian military equipment. 8 activists were detained.

And in Ukraine, the Ukrainian Armed Forces began to form a Belarusian regiment Pogonia (Chase) of Belarusian volunteers. The regiment was created on the initiative of Belarusian officers with the support of the Armed Forces to protect the independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as to create a base for a new professional Belarusian army.

Russian lies

The Center for Strategic Communications explored the main narratives in Russia's Telegram channels on March 28-29. Russian fascist propagandists talk about ""neo-Nazis,"" the sale of orphans, and discrimination against black people. The occupying country demonizes the Ukrainian army and lies about bullying the Russian military, promotes the topic of ""black transplantology"" and argues that poverty has already begun in Europe because of sanctions against Russia. All these are obvious throwaways and fakes.

The Kremlin's lies are very professional and convincing. According to a Levada Center poll, after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russian support for Putin's actions rose to 83%.

Russian fascist propagandist Simonyan and her fictional flash mob.

The Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security states that Russian propaganda media have begun to disperse new lies about Ukraine. They claim our country allegedly did purposeful work to distort the historical truth and ideological preparation for the military operation against Russia. This conclusion is based on the results of an ""analysis of about 300 Ukrainian textbooks and manuals"" conducted by Russian educators and historians. The aggressor state pretends to be the victim, and the victim is tried to be shown as the aggressor. This is how politics is done in Putin's Russia.

Sanctions on the aggressor!

Australia imposes additional duties of 35% on all goods imported from Russia and Belarus.

Japan has included gold bars in the list of luxury items; now they're prohibited to export to Russia. This is the strengthening of sanctions in response to Russian aggression in Ukraine. In addition to ingots, it is also forbidden to export gold coins and banknotes.

Britain has expanded the list of sanctions against Russia. It includes:

– Chairman of the National Center for Defense Management of Russia Mikhail Mizintsev;

– TV presenter Sergei Brilov;

– General Director of Gazprom-Media Aleksandr Zharov;

– Russia Today media group (works under the Sputnik brand);

– RT channel.

Life considering hostilities

Ukrainian karateka Stanislav Horuna has put up for sale his bronze medal, won at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. He will donate the money to support the army. ""My Olympic medal is the most valuable of the more than 200 medals I have won in my 19 years of career. It symbolizes every victory won on the way to the Olympics. I want to sell it at auction and support my people in this difficult time. There's now nothing more important than Ukraine,"" said the athlete.

In Ukraine, a platform has been launched to seek help in all Ukrainian regions, Palyanytsya.Info. On the site, you can find help with evacuation, housing, food, medicine, including for internally displaced persons, the elderly, children. You can search both in individual cities or villages and throughout Ukraine.

In a couple of days, more than 120,000 entrepreneurs applied for the transition to a new tax system: 2% of turnover. The Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal said this in his video address. He noted that in the last week Ukraine began to return to work. ""Business is starting to recover after the first shock. A set of decisions in the field of tax, regulatory, customs, and credit policy has certainly contributed to this. Immediately, several of the largest plants begin to operate,"" said Shmyhal.

After the war, new buildings in Ukraine will be designed with a bomb shelter and a fortified underground parking lot, says Infrastructure Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov.

Trophies of the Armed Forces

The Armed Forces of Ukraine have converted the captured modern Russian Linza medical armored vehicle into a combat vehicle. A large-caliber machine gun was installed on the trophy equipment, which will mow down the Russian invaders.

Ukrainian defenders eliminated a group of Russian occupiers from units of the 7th Military Base. This was reported by the East Operational and Tactical Command.

According to the defenders, these are soldiers who came to fight against Ukraine from the self-proclaimed republic of Abkhazia. The enemy's armored vehicle was also destroyed.

Kyiv and region

According to British intelligence, the occupiers continue to hold positions east and west of Kyiv, despite the withdrawal of a limited number of units. The British Ministry of Defense predicts fighting on the outskirts of Kyiv in the near future.

Units of the National Guard of Ukraine continue to defend Kyiv and destroy enemy vehicles. In the Kyiv direction, artillery units destroyed two self-propelled artillery units, missile systems of volley fire, and several dozen enemy armored vehicles and vehicles.

15:30 – Russian occupation forces withdraw from Kyiv and head north. This was stated by Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby. At the same time, the capital of Ukraine is still under bombardment, airstrikes, and artillery shelling by the occupiers. According to Kirby, the threat to the city still exists.

At the same time, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels that ""Russia is, in fact, trying to regroup, replenish supplies and step up the offensive in Donbas,"" NATO Secretary-General was quoted.

Today in Kyiv, the head of the military administration signed an order to establish a commandant's office. More details here.

""Explanatory work"" is often brutal. Verkhovna Rada deputy Ihor Molotok spoke about cases of torture by the occupiers of the local population, which does not want to receive their orc's ""humanitarian aid."" After one of the residents in the village of Radensk crushed the invaders on a tractor, the occupiers began to walk around the houses and put nails into people's hands.
