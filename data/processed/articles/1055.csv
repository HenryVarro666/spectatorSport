Scheffer', 'Council On Foreign Relations']",2022-04-06 20:45:15-04:00,"Countries including the United States are ramping up calls for war crimes investigations following an apparent massacre in the Ukrainian city of Bucha. Could Russian leaders be brought to justice under international law?

What war crimes are being committed in Ukraine?

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine constitutes the crime of aggression under international law. The primary charge against senior leaders of Nazi Germany at the Nuremberg trials and Japan at the Tokyo war crimes trials was “crimes against the peace,” meaning the initiation of a war of aggression. These trials resulted in the conviction of three dozen perpetrators for aggression. The 1945 United Nations Charter further embedded the illegality of aggressive war (as opposed to defensive war) in international law.

Because they fall under the overarching crime of aggression, all uses of armed force by Russia on Ukrainian territory can be viewed as illegal. Moreover, the Russian military continues to commit various atrocity crimes, a category which includes war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.

War crimes

The unprecedented media coverage of Russia’s invasion has recorded the commission of war crimes in real time. The Russian military has targeted civilian infrastructure including apartment buildings, hospitals, factories, stores, churches, schools, and cultural sites. Even where a military target exists, using disproportionate force while knowing that the strike will likely cause death or injury to civilians or damage to civilian structures is a war crime.

Siege tactics to starve civilians into surrender or to force them to flee as refugees, which now number more than four million, represent clear war crimes, as would any use of cluster munitions or so-called vacuum bombs on civilian areas. The use of a tactical nuclear weapon, which Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov have implied is a possibility, would constitute a war crime because of the collateral damage to civilian lives and property. The use of chemical and biological weapons against any target—civilian or military—would as well.

The withdrawal of Russian forces from the Kyiv region at the beginning of April yielded insight into the scale of civilian casualties. In Bucha, a small city on the outskirts of the Ukrainian capital, journalists and human rights observers documented what appear to be mass graves and bodies of civilians targeted by Russian troops lining the streets. The brutal discoveries in Bucha, where an estimated three hundred civilians were killed, and other cities recaptured by Ukrainian forces prompted U.S. President Joe Biden to call for a war crimes trial to impose accountability.

Crimes against humanity

Russia’s invasion likely also involves crimes against humanity, which are those committed as part of widespread or systematic attacks directed at a civilian population, with knowledge of those attacks. Such crimes include murder, the forcible transfer of a population, severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law, persecution against identifiable groups of civilians, sexual violence, and inhumane acts of similar character that intentionally cause great suffering or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health.

In April, Ukraine reported that over four hundred civilians had been murdered by Russian troops, with many more individuals still missing, in the liberated Kyiv region.

Genocide

Prosecutors may also investigate claims of genocide, which requires the intentional destruction of all or part of a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group. Genocide includes not only killing, but also causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group (in this case, those of Ukrainian nationality) or deliberately inflicting on the group conditions calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part. Establishing the genocidal intent of senior Russian leaders, however, could prove difficult.

How might investigations proceed?

The International Criminal Court (ICC), which has jurisdiction over Ukraine, recently initiated a major investigation after forty countries formally referred the situation to the prosecutor. In addition, the UN Human Rights Council is setting up an investigative commission, and certain governments, the European Union, and nongovernmental organizations are launching their own investigative efforts. This has resulted in the commitment of an unprecedented level of resources for atrocity crimes investigations in a short period of time.

WATCH: Russian retreat from areas around Kyiv reveals ‘pattern of apparent war crimes’

Whatever category of atrocity crimes is ultimately prosecuted, the clear top-down orchestration of the Russian military campaign will lessen the burden of proof for prosecutors. Additionally, ongoing reporting by the media serves as real-time documentation, thus making it difficult for Russian leaders to plead ignorance about atrocity crimes taking place in Ukraine. Nonetheless, they blatantly broadcast their aggressive intentions and, it appears, are doing nothing to prevent such crimes or to punish those who commit them. As a result, building a case against them could be easier.

What role could the United States play in seeking accountability?

Although the United States is not a party to the ICC, it could have a major role to play, especially in light of Biden’s assertion that Putin is a war criminal. Washington could orchestrate the collection and delivery of information from many sources, including refugees, satellite imagery, and declassified electronic intercepts. In fact, despite long-standing opposition to the ICC from the Republican party, some of its leading senators have introduced a resolution supporting the court’s investigative efforts. The U.S. military could also help by analyzing the “order of battle” of Russian troops, which provides useful information for investigators and prosecutors.

WATCH: U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas Greenfield on the atrocities uncovered in Ukraine

Additionally, Washington could support Ukraine in building war crimes cases against Russian soldiers and officers. The Biden administration could immediately lead an initiative at the UN General Assembly for the United Nations to enter into a treaty with the Ukrainian government to establish a special tribunal. This body would be able to prosecute crimes of aggression committed by Russian leaders, which the ICC lacks the jurisdictional authority to carry out. The UN treaties creating the Special Court for Sierra Leone [PDF] and the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia [PDF] two decades ago serve as models.

What is Russia’s track record on investigating such abuses?

The Soviet Union played a major role during and after World War II to investigate and prosecute Nazi war crimes, including the Nazi occupation of Ukrainian cities such as Kharkiv and Kyiv. Between 1943 and 1952, the Soviets prosecuted an estimated eighty-two thousand people as Nazi criminals or collaborators. Soviet officials were also instrumental in creating the Nuremberg tribunal and its prosecution of crimes of aggression. In the 1990s, Russia supported the UN Security Council’s creation of the International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.

In recent decades, however, the Kremlin has not pressed for domestic enforcement of the laws and customs of war in connection with its foreign military adventures. As a result, it is implausible to expect Moscow to cooperate with the ICC’s investigation of atrocity crimes or with any special tribunal established to prosecute the crime of aggression in the future.

In the event there are indicted fugitives, could sanctions help compel their surrender?

Economic sanctions will primarily provide leverage to compel the withdrawal of Russian forces and the restoration of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. If the sanctions are eventually lifted in stages, it could prove effective to include conditions requiring the surrender of indicted fugitives. This tactic served as a powerful incentive for the surrender of indicted leaders such as Slobodan Milosevic to the tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague. However, Serbia did not possess nuclear weapons, so attempts to use similar leverage with respect to indicted Russian fugitives shielded by a nuclear power would be risky.

Will Russia have to pay reparations?

The enormous destruction of property and other financial losses will highlight Russia’s responsibility to eventually pay for the reconstruction of Ukraine and give compensation to its people. The issue of reparations doubtless will be raised in negotiations to resolve the conflict and as an international condition for resuming any normal relationship with Russia.

NEWS WRAP: U.S. charges Russian media baron over sanctions violations

Western countries will vigorously challenge any expectation by Russia that other nations will bear the entire cost of rehabilitating Ukraine. While the post–World War II Marshall Plan, which was led by the United States, helped to rebuild a devastated Europe, Russia should not expect such outside help this time. It remains a viable economy and society despite the international sanctions, and it bears direct responsibility as the aggressor nation.

Spurred by reports of Russian atrocities outside Ukraine’s capital, and alarmed at signs that Russia’s invasion force is about to escalate assaults in eastern Ukraine, many civilians in that region are fleeing while they can, officials said Wednesday.

“The cities of the Luhansk region are in ruins,” warned one eastern governor. “Thousands of residents have not yet left. Get out of the way!”

The exodus accelerated as Western nations moved to provide more weapons to Ukraine’s military and further ostracize Russia economically with new sanctions, including restrictions on its leading banks and on the assets of President Vladimir V. Putin’s children.

The new sanctions are a response to outrage and revulsion over the atrocities, including executions and torture, that appear to have been carried out by Russian forces before they retreated from areas outside Kyiv in the past few weeks. Russia has denied responsibility, saying the atrocities were fabricated or were committed by the Ukrainians themselves.

The European Union also was weighing a ban on coal from Russia, the leading provider of fossil-fuel energy to Europe, and Russia appeared to move closer to default on its foreign debt because of U.S. currency restrictions.

“Together with our allies and our partners, we’re going to keep raising the economic costs and ratchet up the pain for Putin, and further increase Russia’s economic isolation,” said President Biden, who has described Mr. Putin as a war criminal and suggested he should not remain in power.

More than 11 million Ukrainians — roughly one in four — have fled their homes since the Feb. 24 invasion, according to the United Nations, including more than four million who have fled the country. It is the biggest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.

The Russian military announced last week that it would focus its campaign on eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting for eight years. The redeployment came as the Russians, hampered by botched planning and fierce Ukrainian military resistance, retreated from the Kyiv area and apparently abandoned — at least for now — any effort to capture the capital in their war to subjugate the former Soviet republic.

Western military analysts have said the Russians vastly underestimated the challenges in Ukraine and that their initial invasion force of more than 150,000 has been weakened by losses, exhaustion and low morale. But that does not mean Russia’s military cannot undertake a powerful new assault in eastern Ukraine.

The shift has accelerated civilian displacement in the east. Thousands of people have been leaving, according to Ukrainian officials, and photos and videos posted online. Ukrainian officials say Russian troops have been massing in the Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv regions.

In Kramatorsk, a city in the north of the Donetsk region, photos showed crowds of people huddled at a platform in a central train station.

At least two people were killed and five injured when Russian forces launched a strike on a humanitarian aid site in the town of Vugledar in the Donetsk region, according to Pavlo Kyrylenko, the Donetsk governor.

Russian forces now control 60 percent of the town of Rubizhne, in the Luhansk region, according to the governor there, Serhiy Haidai, who said the attackers had scaled up their offensive this week.

“Evacuations are taking place under the roar of enemy guns,” Mr. Haidai wrote in a Facebook post on Wednesday, saying that approximately 30,000 people had left the region since Russia invaded. He urged remaining residents to flee before Russia scaled up attacks.

Oleg Synegubov, the state administrator for the Kharkiv military region, said Wednesday in a post on Telegram that the army would evacuate two towns in the eastern part of the country because fighting was escalating there.

The towns, Lozova and Barvinkove, are southwest of Izium, a city Russian forces seized as part of an apparent drive toward Sloviansk, which military analysts say is strategically critical to Russia’s plan to gain full control of eastern Ukraine.

Earlier this week, Oleksiy Danilov, the head of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, speaking on national television, said “large groupings of Russian troops” had been massing in the region.

“They are not going to stop,” he said. “They have a great desire to create big problems for our armed forces in this direction, and we also expect that fierce battles will be fought there for our territory in the near future.”

The Pentagon’s assessment of Russian deployments appeared to corroborate what Ukrainian officials were saying. Pentagon officials said Russia had withdrawn all of its troops arrayed against Kyiv and another city in the north, Chernihiv, and sent them back to Russia or to its ally Belarus to rearm, resupply and possibly redeploy in eastern Ukraine.

The Pentagon officials said those forces included as many as 40,000 troops that, in many cases, had departed under fierce attack from the Ukrainian military units that retook the territory.

“We believe they are all out,” one senior Pentagon official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential operational issues.

Russia now has about 30 battalion tactical groups — as many as 30,000 troops — in the east, the senior Pentagon official said. Earlier this week, Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden’s national security adviser, said Russia would most likely send “tens of thousands of soldiers to the front line in Ukraine’s east” in the coming weeks.

Largely in anticipation of this next major phase of the war, the Pentagon announced late Tuesday that it was sending $100 million worth of Javelin anti-tank missiles — roughly several hundred missiles — to Ukraine, where the weapon has been used with high success in destroying Russian tanks and other armored vehicles.

NATO foreign ministers, meeting this week, have been discussing how to further help Ukraine prosecute the war without entangling the alliance in direct combat with Russian forces.

The war, they said, is far from over, noting that however badly Russia’s forces have performed, and their retreat from areas around Kyiv notwithstanding, they are making slow and brutal progress in the east.

“Moscow is not giving up its ambitions in Ukraine,” said Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary general.

Ukrainian officials in a number of areas, including Mykolayiv in the south and the Luhansk and Donetsk regions in the east, have been sharing schedules of planned evacuations or links to online portals for people to sign up to join buses and trains that are transporting residents to safer places.

But in some besieged cities in the south, like Mariupol, it is already nearly impossible to leave, making evacuations sporadic and risky.

Attempts by the Red Cross to enter Mariupol to supervise civilian departures have repeatedly been scrubbed, leaving fearful residents to fend for themselves. On Wednesday, 500 people who had escaped Mariupol to join a Red Cross convoy in the nearby city of Berdyansk arrived in Zaporizhzhia, about 100 miles away.

The climate of fear gripping Mariupol has spread to the region of Kherson, near the Black Sea, where people have lived under occupation by Russian forces since they encircled and entered the city and its suburbs on March 2.

“Anyone who did not leave early is now stuck here,” said Evgeniya Selivantseva, a doctor from Velyka Lepetyka, a village on the Dnipro River, in the Kherson region.

Dr. Selivantseva, 38, described a deepening humanitarian crisis in the village: Gasoline stations have run out of fuel, and food and medical supplies are running low. Food is so scarce that local leaders have started a makeshift flour mill.

“We feel helpless and totally defenseless,” she said. “People are afraid to leave their homes.”

The proposed European Union ban on Russian coal, part of the bloc’s effort to further penalize Russia over atrocities in Ukraine, reflected a choice of an imported energy source that would be the easiest to replace.

Deliberations over the ban and other sanctions were set to continue into Thursday, and European Union officials and diplomats anticipated that the measures would be approved. The process reflected the challenges of reaching agreement among all 27 member nations on the penalties, which would also include banning Russian ships from E.U. ports.

If approved, the sanctions would be the harshest enforced by the bloc since the invasion.

Though the European Union depends on Russian coal, the bloc could find substitute imports more easily than for natural gas and oil.

But banning coal from Russia could send energy prices soaring for European consumers, given the existing shortages in the bloc, according to Rystad Energy, a consulting firm. Carlos Torres Diaz, a senior vice president at Rystad, called the potential sanctions “a double-edged sword.”

4:32 am: Pentagon says Putin has given up on taking Kyiv but ‘significant battle’ still ahead for southeastern Ukraine

US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Thursday that Russian President Vladimir Putin has given up on conquering Kyiv after his forces were soundly beaten back by the Ukrainian military.

“Putin thought that he could very rapidly take over the country of Ukraine, very rapidly capture this capital city. He was wrong,” Austin told a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee in Congress.

“I think Putin has given up on his efforts to capture the capital city and is now focused on the south and east of the country,” said Austin.

But the path of the overall war, six weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine, remains uncertain, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, told the same hearing.

For Ukraine to “win” the fight, it needs to remain a free and independent nation, with its recognised territory intact, he said.

“That’s going to be very difficult. That’s going to be a long slog,” Milley said.

“The first part of it has probably been successfully waged,” he said of the war that began on February 24.

“But there is a significant battle yet ahead down in the southeast, down around the Donbas region where the Russians intend to mass forces and continue their assault,” he said.

“So I think it’s an open question right now, how this ends.”

1:58 am: EU approves Russia coal embargo, proposes more arms to Ukraine

The European Union on Thursday said it had approved an embargo on Russian coal and the closing of the bloc’s ports to Russian vessels over the Ukraine war.

An official from the French presidency of the European Council said the moves spearhead a “very substantial” fifth round of sanctions against Moscow.

That package also includes a 10 billion euro ($10.9 billion) ban on exports to Russia, including high-tech goods, and the freezing of several Russian banks’ assets.

In addition to the sanctions, the EU also backed a proposal to boost its funding of arms supplies to Ukraine by 500 million euros, taking it to a total of 1.5 billion euros.

European Council President Charles Michel said on Twitter the package would be “swiftly approved”.

Thanks and support to @JosepBorrellF for your proposal to top up the #EuropeanPeaceFacility with a further €500M. Once swiftly approved this will bring to 1.5 billion the EU support already provided for military equipment for #Ukraine. @ZelenskyyUa — Charles Michel (@eucopresident) April 7, 2022

The new financial measures were proposed by the European Commission after the bodies of dozens of civilians were found last weekend in Bucha, near Kyiv.

It is the first time the Europeans have targeted the Russian energy sector, on which they are heavily dependent.

The EU nations import 45 percent of their coal from Russia, worth 4 billion euros a year.

The embargo will come into force at the beginning of August, 120 days after the publication of the new package in the EU’s official journal, expected on Friday.

1:28 am: WHO confirms over 100 attacks on health facilities in Ukraine

The World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday said it had confirmed over 100 attacks on health services in Ukraine, as it called for humanitarian access to the besieged city of Mariupol.

“As of now, WHO has verified 103 incidents of attacks on health care, with 73 people killed and 51 injured, including health workers and patients,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press conference, calling it a “grim milestone.”

Of the confirmed attacks, 89 had impacted health facilities and most of the rest hit transport services, including ambulances.

“We are outraged that attacks on health care are continuing,” the WHO chief said, adding they constituted “a violation of international humanitarian law.”

Speaking at an earlier press conference in Lviv, WHO regional director for Europe Hans Kluge lamented that while health assistance had reached many “affected areas”, some were still out of reach.

“It’s true some remain very difficult. I think a priority definitely, I think we all agree, would be Mariupol,” Kluge told reporters.

April 8, 12:10 am: Canada to offer up to C$1 bn in new financing to Ukraine

Canada will offer Ukraine up to C$1 billion ($794 million) in new loan resources via the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and provide an additional C$500 million in military aid, the Liberal government said on Thursday.

The announcements in the federal budget mean Canada has now committed more than C$1.2 billion in direct contributions to Ukraine, as well as offering up to C$1.6 billion in loan supports.

“This support has helped respond to the humanitarian crisis, and ensure that the Ukrainian government can continue to provide essential services,” the budget said.

Canada will offer up to C$1 billion in new loan resources to Kyiv through a new Administered Account for Ukraine at the IMF.

Since 2015, Canadian troops have been training Ukrainian forces in the west of the country. In January, Ottawa said the mission would be expanded.

Canada, which has announced more than C$90 million in lethal and non-lethal weaponry to Ukraine so far, said on Thursday it proposed to provide an additional $500 million in the 2022-23 fiscal year to provide further military aid.

11:25 pm: Biden calls signs of Ukraine atrocities an ‘outrage’ to humanity

“Russia’s lies are no match for the undeniable evidence of what is happening in Ukraine,” Biden said in a statement.

10:20 pm: Russian Nobel-winning editor attacked on train

Russian journalist and Nobel Peace prize laureate Dmitry Muratov was Thursday assaulted on a train by a person who sprayed him with paint, his newspaper Novaya Gazeta reported.

“An unknown assailant attacked the chief editor of Novaya Gazeta and Nobel prize winner in a train coach,” the independent publication said via Telegram.

“He threw oil-based paint mixed with acetone into the compartment. He shouted, ‘Muratov, that’s for our boys’,” the paper quoted Muratov as saying, in apparent allusion to Russian casualties in the Ukraine war.

“My eyes are burning terribly. I am going to try to wash it off,” Muratov was quoted as saying after the attack on a train headed from Moscow to the southeastern city of Samara.

""For every Bucha there are many more towns Russia has occupied and more towns that it is still occupying, places where we must assume Russian soldiers are committing more atrocities right now,"" Blinken told journalists after meeting foreign ministers from NATO and Ukraine in Brussels. He said the US had warned ahead of Russia's invasion that part of the Kremlin's ""campaign plan was to inflict atrocities, was to target individuals, was to commit the kinds of crimes that we're now seeing to terrorise civilian populations"".

""And so this, as we saw it, was part of the game plan all along,"" he said.

German intelligence services have intercepted radio traffic of Russian soldiers discussing the killings of civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, Spiegel reported Thursday, in what would be new evidence linking Moscow troops to the deaths.

Some of the audio material collected appears to relate to victims found dead along a main street in Bucha, the magazine said, citing a closed-door parliamentary briefing given by Germany's foreign intelligence service BND. Among the intercepts was a soldier's description of how he and his platoon mates shot a person on a bicycle.

5:21 pm: Ukraine using landmines effectively against Russia, US general says

Ukraine is effectively using landmines in the conflict with Russia, forcing Russian armored vehicles into engagement areas where they are vulnerable to US-supplied anti-tank weaponry, the top US general told a Senate hearing on Thursday.

""That's one of the reasons why you see column after column of Russian vehicles that are destroyed. So anti-tank or anti-personnel mines are very effective,"" Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee.

4:43 pm: After Kyiv win, Ukraine still faces significant battle in southeast, US general says

Ukrainian forces have successfully managed to counter Russia's attempt to take Kyiv but a significant battle is still ahead in the southeast of the country, the top US general said on Thursday.

""There is a significant battle yet ahead down in the southeast, down around the Donbas, Donetsk region where the Russians intend to mass forces and continue their assault,"" General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told lawmakers during a hearing.

4:42 pm: Conquering Mariupol will 'take time', pro-Russian separatist official says

A pro-Russian separatist official in eastern Ukraine said Thursday it was impossible to say how long it could take Moscow's forces to fully seize the besieged city of Mariupol.

Mariupol, located in the country's southeast between Russia-occupied Crimea and pro-Russian separatist regions in Ukraine's east, has been the scene of some of the fiercest fighting.

Most recently, fighting has centred around the city's Azovstal iron and steel works and port, said Eduard Basurin, a senior official in the self-proclaimed breakaway stronghold of Donetsk. In televised remarks, he described Mariupol's industrial zone as a ""city within a city"".

4:40 pm: India says focus is on stabilising economic ties with Russia

India is focused on stabilising its economic ties with Russia and is working to devise a payment mechanism to settle trade amid Western sanctions against Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine, the foreign ministry said on Thursday.

""We have an etablished economic relation with Russia. Given the current circumstance post development in Ukraine, I think there is an effort by both sides to ensure that this economic relationship remains stable,"" ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a news conference.

3:51 pm: Novaya Gazeta opens outlet in Europe after suspending activities in Russia

Russian journalists from investigative paper Novaya Gazeta said on Thursday they were launching a new media outlet in Europe after their paper suspended its activities over warnings it received from the authorities.

Novaya Gazeta, whose editor-in-chief Dmitry Muratov was co-winner of last year's Nobel Peace Prize, was among the liberal Russian media facing increased pressure in the wake of Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine.

Last month, the paper said it could no longer operate in Russia after receiving warnings from communications watchdog Roskomnadzor for failing to properly identify an organisation deemed a ""foreign agent"" by the authorities in its publications.

3:50 pm: Turkey offers to host future Ukraine-Russia peace talks

Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Thursday he had told his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba that peace talks with Russia can be held in Turkey from now on.

Speaking after a NATO meeting in Brussels, Cavusoglu said there were still around 30 Turkish citizens, including their companions, stuck in Ukraine's southern port city of Mariupol, where thousands of people are believed to have died after a month under Russian siege and relentless bombardment.

""The road to Chuhuiv is deserted; the debris from recent fighting litters the wayside,"" FRANCE 24's Catherine Norris-Trent reports. ""This small town southeast of Kharkiv has been caught in the crossfire for weeks. Hiding from the bombs, thousands here are still living underground. Four hundred people are crammed into this network of bunkers; most have been living here non-stop since the first days of the war nearly six weeks ago. Among them, the elderly and nearly 80 children.""

3:47 pm:Thousands find refuge in Lviv transit centres

""Since the start of this war in Ukraine, some 200,000 people have come to Lviv in the west of the country; most of them have come through transit centres like this one, where they're given initial accomodation, food, security, backup, and of course they have to go through security checks as well,"" FRANCE 24 Chief International Affairs Editor Robert Parsons reported from Lviv. ""After that, they're redistributed around the country – to families, to churches, to anywhere that can take them and provide them with food.""

3:28 pm: Turkey says Bucha killings 'overshadow' Russia-Ukraine talks

Images of bodies found in the Ukrainian town of Bucha and other areas near Kyiv in the wake of a Russian pullback have scuppered the positive atmosphere that followed recent talks between Russia and Ukraine, Turkey said Thursday.

""The images from Bucha, Irpin and other regions are unacceptable. These scenes have overshadowed the negotiations,"" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told journalists after a NATO meeting in Brussels. ""The emerging positive atmosphere, unfortunately, was overshadowed.""

3:23 pm: Ukraine dismisses Russian criticism of Kyiv over peace talks as propaganda

Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak dismissed comments by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday suggesting Kyiv had presented it with a draft peace deal that deviated from proposals both sides had previously agreed on.

Podolyak told Reuters in a written statement that Lavrov was not directly involved in negotiations and his statements were ""of purely propagandistic significance"". Podolyak said Moscow wanted to divert attention from events in the town of Bucha, where Ukraine accuses Russian troops of killing civilians, and added: ""That is how any such statements should be regarded.""

3:21 pm: More than 4.3 million Ukrainians flee war, UN says

More than 4.3 million Ukrainians have now fled their country since the Russian invasion, the United Nations said Thursday.

UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, said 4,319,494 Ukrainians had fled across the border since the war began on February 24 – a figure up 40,705 since Wednesday. The agency says it is Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II. The UN's International Organisation for Migration estimates that 7.1 million internally displaced people had fled their homes but were still in Ukraine.

2:43 pm: Dnipro mayor urges women and children to leave as fighting intensifies

The mayor of Dnipro in central-eastern Ukraine urged women, children and the elderly on Thursday to leave the city because the conflict with Russia is expected to intensify in eastern regions.

The recommendation follows similar warnings by the authorities in the Luhansk region, which is east of Dnipro. The regional governor of Luhansk urged all residents on Wednesday to evacuate while they still could in relative safety.

""All those who have the ability, as I have already said, should leave. This involves women, children, the elderly, those who are not [...] directly integrated into the economy,"" said Dnipro's mayor Borys Filatov in an online video address.

2:37 pm: Cyprus to revoke passports of four sanctioned Russians

Cyprus will revoke the passports of four sanctioned Russians who had received citizenship under an investment scheme discontinued in late 2020, government sources said on Thursday.

The names of the individuals were not disclosed, but they are on a list of more than 800 people sanctioned by the European Union in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and considered to be close to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

2:36 pm: Russia accuses Ukraine of changing demands since Istanbul talks

Russia on Thursday accused Ukrainian negotiators of changing demands since last month's talks in Istanbul, claiming that Kyiv was not interested in ending fighting.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that on Wednesday the Ukrainian side had presented its draft agreement. ""It shows a departure from the most important provisions spelled out at the meeting in Istanbul on March 29,"" he said.

In Turkey, ""the Ukrainians clearly stated that future (international) security guarantees for Ukraine do not apply to Crimea and Sevastopol,"" Lavrov said, referring to territory Moscow annexed in 2014.

2:35 pm: WHO says making contingency plans for possible 'chemical assaults'

The World Health Organisation's European head said on Thursday that the body was preparing for possible ""chemical assaults"" in Ukraine, in a sign it is taking warnings that have emerged from both the West and Moscow seriously.

""Given the uncertainties of the current situation, there are no assurances that the war will not get worse,"" Hans Kluge, WHO regional director for Europe, said during a briefing from Lviv, Ukraine. ""WHO is considering all scenarios and making contingencies for different situations that could afflict the people of Ukraine, from the continued treatment of mass casualties, to chemical assaults,"" he said.

2:03 pm: Hungary breaks ranks with the EU on the issue of arming Ukraine

NATO countries are debating over whether or not they should provide hard weapons to Ukraine. There are worries that hard military equipment like tanks would be vulnerable to Russian attacks while they are within NATO territory. For its part, Hungary has said that not only will it not arm Ukraine, but it will not allow any arms to go through Hungary if they were to come from another country further west in the EU. FRANCE 24's Dave Keating reports from Brussels.

1:44 pm: Ukrainian military says Russia likely to renew attack on Kyiv if it takes Donbas

Russia is likely to renew its attack on Kyiv if its forces succeed in taking full control of the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, the deputy chief of staff of Ukraine's ground forces said on Thursday.

Speaking at an online briefing about efforts to defend the capital, Oleksandr Gruzevich said: ""It is likely the enemy has not given up the goal of a second attack on Kyiv – there is such a threat.""

11:37 am: Ukraine warns of 'last chance' to flee Russian attacks in east

A Ukrainian official in the east of the county warned residents remaining there Thursday that time was running out to flee mounting Russian attacks, saying that all villages in the region were under attack.

""These few days may be the last chance to leave,"" Lugansk regional governor Sergiy Gaiday wrote to residents on Facebook, cautioning that Russian forces were ""trying to cut off all possible ways of taking people out"".

10:30 am: Ukraine's Zelensky to meet EU's von der Leyen on Friday

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will hold talks in Kyiv on Friday with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Ukrainian presidential spokesman Sergii Nykyforov said on national television.

He said other details of the talks would not be announced for security reasons. A European Union spokesman said on Tuesday that the EU's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, would also travel to Kyiv this week.

9:49 am: UK says Russian artillery, air strikes continue along Donbas line of control

Russian artillery and air strikes are continuing along the Donbas line of control, British military intelligence said on Thursday in an update on Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

The UK defence ministry said on Twitter that the main focus of Russian forces was to advance offensive operations in eastern Ukraine.

9:38 am: Ukraine urges Hungary to 'get on the right side of history' over Russia

Ukraine said on Thursday that Hungary's position that it is prepared to pay in roubles for Russian gas was an ""unfriendly"" stance that was destroying the unity of the European Union over Russia's invasion.

""If Hungary really wants to help end the war, here's how to do it: stop destroying unity in the EU, support new anti-Russian sanctions, provide military assistance to Ukraine, and not create additional sources of funding for Russia's military machine. It is never too late to get on the right side of history,"" Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko said.

9:26 am: Turkey says Black Sea countries discussed Ukraine war, floating mines

Defence ministers from Black Sea coastal countries held a video call on Thursday to discuss the war in Ukraine, mines floating in the sea and regional security, the Turkish Defence Ministry said, adding that the ministers had called for an immediate ceasefire.

In a statement, Ankara said the defence ministers of Turkey, Bulgaria, Georgia, Poland, Romania and Ukraine had met via video conference upon the invitation of Turkey, adding they held ""very efficient"" talks.

""Aside from the mines, the importance of cooperation in the Black Sea for peace, calm and stability was emphasised,"" Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said after the meeting, according to his ministry, adding the ministers discussed possible steps to alleviate the humanitarian crisis and get aid to Ukraine.

Turkish military diving teams have so far detonated three separate floating naval mines in the Black Sea, while Romania has also defused a stray mine in its waters since the Ukraine war.

9:22 am: Russia says it destroyed fuel storage facilities in four Ukrainian cities

The Russian defence ministry said on Thursday its missiles had destroyed four fuel storage facilities in the Ukrainian cities of Mykolayiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and Chuhuiv overnight.

The ministry said the facilities were used by Ukraine to supply its troops near the cities of Mykolaiv and Kharkiv and in the Donbas region in the far southeast.

8:25 am: Ukraine seeks 'long-term solutions' to help it win war with Russia

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, who was holding talks with G7 and NATO nations on Thursday, said his country was seeking ""long-term solutions"" to help it win its war with Russia.

""I came here today to discuss three most important things: weapons, weapons, and weapons. Ukraine’s urgent needs, the sustainability of supplies, and long-term solutions which will help Ukraine to prevail,"" Kuleba wrote in a tweet which he said was sent from NATO headquarters in Brussels.

8:07 am: Russian troops withdraw from outskirts of Kyiv, build up forces in the east

The Ukrainian defence ministry confirmed Pentagon reports this morning that Russia had withdrawn its military from the north of Kyiv and is now in the process of moving troops to the east of Ukraine. There has already been a considerable uptick in the fighting in the Donbas region. FRANCE 24's Rob Parsons reports from Lviv.

7:36 am: Ukraine to press West for full energy embargo on Russia

Ukraine will keep up demands on the West for an oil and gas embargo on Russia after its invasion of the country, the Ukrainian foreign minister said on Thursday. Dmytro Kuleba also called for the dispatch of more planes, air defence systems, missiles and military vehicles from NATO allies.

""We will continue to insist on full oil and gas embargo,"" he told reporters at NATO, speaking alongside Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.

7:29 am: US ramps up sanctions on Russia

The Biden administration announced it would expand and increase some of the same types of sanctions that have been seen in the past, with full blocking sanctions on two major Russian banks. These sanctions, like the previous ones, include a carve-out for energy purchases. FRANCE 24's correspondent Kethevane Gorjestani reports from Washington, DC.

""The goal of US sanctions is to continue to isolate Russia"" 01:36

6:05 am: Ukraine girds for renewed Russian offensive on eastern front

Ukraine braced for a climactic battle for control of the besieged country's industrial east, as Russian forces withdrew from the shattered outskirts of Kyiv to regroup and intensify their offensive across the Donbas region, where authorities urged people to evacuate before time runs out.

The mayor of the southern port city of Mariupol said Wednesday that more than 5,000 civilians had been killed there. Meanwhile, in areas north of the capital, Ukrainian officials gathered evidence of Russian atrocities amid telltale signs that Moscow’s troops killed people indiscriminately before retreating over the past several days.

In his nightly address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that the Russian military continued to build up its forces in preparation for a new offensive in the east, where the Kremlin has said its goal is to “liberate” the Donbas, Ukraine’s mostly Russian-speaking industrial heartland. But he said Ukraine, too, was preparing for battle.

“We will fight and we will not retreat,” he said. “We will seek all possible options to defend ourselves until Russia begins to seriously seek peace. This is our land. This is our future. And we won’t give them up.”

5:30 am: US Senate to vote on revoking Russia's trade status, oil ban

The US Senate will take up legislation Thursday to end normal trade relations with Russia and to ban the importation of its oil. Both bills have been bogged down in the Senate, frustrating lawmakers who want to ratchet up the US response to Russia’s war with Ukraine.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Russian President Vladimir Putin needs to be held accountable for what Schumer said were war crimes against Ukraine.

The trade suspension measure paves the way for US President Joe Biden to enact higher tariffs on certain Russian imports. The bill banning Russian oil would codify restrictions Biden has already put in place through executive action.

In Bucha, bodies have been found with hands tied and gunshot wounds to the head. A report published by Human Rights Watch, on Sunday, documented sexual violence and alleged killings by Russian troops in other parts of the country. Earlier this week, President Biden called for the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, to face a trial for war crimes. (Satellite imagery revealed that the dead bodies in Bucha had been present for weeks, casting doubt on Russian claims that they had been placed there after Russian forces departed.) On Tuesday, the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, addressed the United Nations Security Council, and asked, “Are you ready to close the U.N.? Do you think the time of international law is gone? If the answer is no, then you need to act immediately.” (Later in the week, the New York Times posted a still frame from a video that appeared to show Ukrainian troops executing captured Russian combatants.)

To talk through what, if any, consequences the Russian leadership could face for these actions, I recently spoke by phone with Oona Hathaway, a professor at Yale Law School and the director of the school’s Center for Global Legal Challenges and the co-author, with Scott J. Shapiro, of the book “The Internationalists.” She also serves on a committee that offers guidance to the State Department on international law. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed the different mechanisms that could be used to bring members of the Russian military to justice, how American actions have undermined the prospects for international accountability, and how international law might change after the Ukraine conflict.

What does it mean, in practice, for a big and powerful country to commit war crimes in 2022?

Well, it means that the international legal order is really under serious stress. This is, of course, not the first time that a major country has committed war crimes, even in recent years. We’ve seen war crimes taking place, for instance, in Syria, for much of the last several years. But what’s distinctive about this current moment is that we haven’t seen a fight between a major global power (here, Russia) and another state (here, Ukraine) in the last couple of decades, where the rules of the Geneva Conventions, the vast rules of international humanitarian law, are being broken on a massive scale.

We all have an idea of what war crimes are, but what is the underlying legal framework here? Is it just the Geneva Conventions, or something else?

The rules are not limited simply to the Geneva Conventions. It could also include customary international law that supplements the treaty rules in the Geneva Conventions. International humanitarian law creates a kind of foundational framework that we look to when we’re thinking about war crimes, and war crimes are any serious violation of international humanitarian law. So we look to: What does international humanitarian law provide? What does it require? What does it allow states to do? What does it prohibit states from doing? And then is there any significant violation of those rules? And, if there is, that can be a war crime.

And, in terms of enforcement mechanisms, it seems like there is the International Criminal Court, but beyond that?

There are two categories of accountability mechanisms. There are domestic courts, and there are international courts. And, generally speaking, when war crimes are committed it’s often the domestic courts that take the lead in addressing the problem. So you may remember that there were some courts-martial of U.S. soldiers for war crimes, and a few of them were pardoned by President Trump after having been convicted. And actually in Ukraine we see that the prosecutor general of the country has already opened more than two thousand investigations into possible war crimes taking place in Ukraine, and is likely to start prosecuting Russian soldiers—particularly soldiers who are currently being held as prisoners of war and may have participated in some of those war crimes and therefore can be subject to prosecution for violating international humanitarian law.

So it would be prosecutions on the domestic level for violations of international law?

Exactly. Almost every country in the world that is party to the Geneva Conventions has its own domestic statute that allows for the criminal prosecution of war crimes. So the United States has its own War Crimes Act that allows prosecution of war crimes here in the United States. And Ukraine has war crimes as part of its domestic criminal law. But that is done in the shadow of the international law, and the Geneva Conventions in fact require states that are party to the conventions to be able to criminally prosecute violations of the conventions. So every state is actually required to have a mechanism for domestic prosecutions of war crimes.

And what happens if America or Russia just decides not to follow the Geneva Conventions? There is no enforcement mechanism for that, correct?

Yeah, other than all the enforcement mechanisms we’re seeing the world try to use against Russia. So sanctions. And, if any of those who are suspected of crimes were to travel outside Russia, they potentially could be subject to prosecution for war crimes. So there are some possible mechanisms.

Yes, this happened with Pinochet.

Yeah, and that’s an issue that can come up for a number of these folks. And then they’re also subject to prosecution in Ukraine. And Ukraine actually has a system in place for not only indicting people in absentia but potentially even trying them, although I’m not sure that that’s something the international community is going to be enthusiastic about because it’s considered to be not entirely kosher with human-rights norms. But if they were to travel to other states that have war-crimes statutes . . .

Why isn’t it considered kosher?

The idea of trying someone who isn’t present brings up concerns that he or she is not able to properly defend themselves.

Can you talk a little bit about the International Criminal Court, which Russia is not party to? How does it function?

I think the I.C.C. has a lot of potential to be useful here. You are absolutely right that neither Russia nor Ukraine is a party to the Rome Statute, which is the treaty that created the I.C.C. But back in 2014 Ukraine agreed to submit events taking place in Ukraine to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, and then it renewed that and expanded it. And that submission remains in place. And so, even though Ukraine is not party to the International Criminal Court, it has submitted to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, which basically means that if there are crimes committed in Ukraine that are within the scope of the crimes that can be prosecuted in the International Criminal Court, then the I.C.C. can open an investigation and in fact move forward with the prosecution, and that has happened.

So an I.C.C. prosecutor announced that he was opening an investigation. And he also announced that he’s received forty-one state referrals, which essentially indicates that the state strongly supports moving forward with an investigation. Some states have offered additional funding and assistance to the prosecutor in investigating war crimes and crimes against humanity. And now we’re hearing reports potentially of genocidal acts, as well, in Ukraine. So that is the international mechanism that is already at work with doing some of the evidence collection and doing some investigations that would be necessary in order to move forward with prosecution of these war crimes.

America has played a huge role in undermining the I.C.C. The Bush Administration would not coöperate with it. The Trump Administration sanctioned people at the I.C.C. and said that we would never send people there for trial. Beyond the morality of this, what about the practical impact? Is the I.C.C. really going to function without meaningful American support?

So it has been functioning even without strong U.S. support. It’s not perfect, but it has managed to move forward with some significant prosecutions, some of which have been with U.S. support. It’s important to note that the United States supported the referral of the situation in Sudan to the International Criminal Court, for instance. [The U.S. declined to formally support a referral, but didn’t object.]

I was referring to referrals of our own citizens.

Oh, yes, absolutely. The United States has had a very fraught relationship with the International Criminal Court from the beginning of the Bush Administration, which was shortly after the Clinton Administration signed the Rome Statute. Bush came in, and he tried to unsign the Rome Statute and then proceeded to go around the world telling countries that if they didn’t sign an agreement exempting the U.S. from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, for crimes committed on their soil, the U.S. would withdraw foreign aid from them.",https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/the-shadow-of-international-law
5,0f964e7e-b6aa-4901-ae24-c0383527721a,[],,"Photos and reporting emerging following the withdrawal of Russian forces from towns near Kyiv have triggered global revulsion, notably at the apparent summary execution of civilians. This initial evidence strongly suggests that Russian behavior in towns like Bucha and Irpin amounts to the widespread, systematic violence against civilians typical of atrocity crimes. World leaders have condemned the violence as war crimes, urging investigations and accountability. Ensuring eventual accountability for perpetrators and justice for victims means governments and others must quickly support the essential first step: the broadest possible collection of evidence.

While the volume of video footage, photos, satellite imagery and witness testimony seems to overwhelmingly incriminate Russian forces, achieving accountability will require painstaking work to gather and process the evidence. To collect evidence amid armed conflict, investigators must reach crime scenes, victims and witnesses who remain under threat. Especially amid the confusion of war, people may disrupt crime scenes and inadvertently destroy evidence as they clear debris for safety or health reasons — or simply by burying the bodies of their loved ones. Victims and witnesses may flee to safety, making them hard to find during an investigation. Investigators must evaluate documentary evidence — including photos and video or audio recordings — to ensure that it has not been manipulated and is not misinformation. They must analyze the evidence to ensure that the legally defined elements of each crime are met and that liability has been sufficiently established. This is particularly true with allegations of genocide, which requires establishing the “intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.”

To Promote Justice, Use Every Channel

No single court or judicial system can prosecute the myriad types of war-related crimes now emerging in Ukraine. The surest path to enforcing accountability is to simultaneously use international and national-level judicial systems in a web of “mutually reinforcing approaches,” Georgetown University law professor Jane Stromseth urged in a recent USIP forum. This strategy, endorsed by many other experts, must begin with a similarly multi-channel approach to gathering evidence. So for governments, organizations and citizens seeking to advance accountability, it’s worth pausing to note four distinct types of investigative efforts underway, and the particular contributions that each can make.

U.N.-Led Factfinding: A Broad Inquiry. The U.N. Human Rights Council established an Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine to “establish the facts, circumstances and root causes” of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law related to Russia’s invasion. Such U.N.-backed commissions of inquiry typically gather evidence through open-source materials, submissions from interested parties and investigative missions. While the commission will have the power to identify perpetrators and recommend accountability measures, its most significant impact will likely be in establishing a U.N.-recognized historical record that can broadly strengthen the credibility of all accountability efforts and support restitution and reparations for victims.

Criminal Investigations: National and International. Criminal investigations center largely around the work of Ukraine’s Prosecutor General’s Office. These efforts are led by trained criminal investigators, who operate under investigative rules of procedure and of evidence. To date, the Ukrainian Prosecutor General’s Office has documented more than 4,000 alleged war crimes, many based on citizen reports via a public website. Ukraine’s efforts are complemented by a separate joint investigative team supported by the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation. This team includes investigators from Lithuania and Poland, both of which have opened their own criminal investigations into Russia’s conduct in Ukraine. The team also will facilitate cooperation between its members and the International Criminal Court (ICC). The ICC, a permanent criminal court established through a treaty among 123 member states to prosecute atrocity crimes, operates the third investigative team on Ukrainian territory. While the ICC conducts its own investigations, it relies heavily on evidence shared by states, civil society and individual people. In addition, many states that have established universal jurisdiction over atrocity crimes — including Germany, Spain and Sweden — have opened investigations. While these states have not sent teams to Ukraine, they will likely rely on the work of the European Union team and of human rights organizations. Achieving the fullest accountability for crimes will require these disparate investigations to efficiently share information and to collaborate on prosecution strategies for offenders within different venues.

Human Rights Documentation Efforts. Investigations by civil society organizations add data and analysis to support criminal investigations and the U.N. fact-finding effort — and also civil and non-judicial processes of accountability. Alongside the international human rights monitors, such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, many Ukrainian-led documentation efforts formed following Russia’s 2014 aggression in the Donbas region. Civil society and citizen-led efforts are playing an increasingly important role, and new efforts are likely to have begun documenting crimes throughout Ukraine since the February invasion. These efforts typically capture victim and witness testimonies and may include efforts to corroborate those accounts. Such grassroots efforts may serve as an important source of information for criminal investigations, but further investigation is typically required to use the evidence they collect in criminal proceedings. Citizens’ efforts are central to civil and non-judicial efforts to provide victims with justice and recognition of their losses, including restitution and reparations.

Digital Open-Source Investigations. Digital investigators have become critical partners in collecting open-source evidence and providing technical skills and additional capabilities to monitor reports of crimes and to determine the authenticity of digital evidence. Several non-government groups — led by the British-based Center for Information Resilience — maintain a crowd-sourced Russia-Ukraine Monitor Map and archive of military events, including civilian casualties and attacks on civilian infrastructure. Netherlands-based Bellingcat tracks Russian misinformation and the use of cluster munitions against civilians using satellite and drone imagery, and the group authenticates evidence submitted by civilians. Amnesty International’s Crisis Evidence Lab provides similar support for Amnesty International investigations of military attacks on civilians. This authentication process can add sources of reliable evidence to the other types of investigations.

Supporting the Collection of Evidence

Given the need for multiple channels of evidence collection, governments and others interested in accountability should support a range of efforts. This may include:

Remaining firm in supporting United Nations and International Criminal Court inquiries through financial contributions, the sharing of intelligence and other evidence, and public statements affirming support for accountability processes.

Bolstering the capacity of Ukraine’s Prosecutor General’s Office to conduct investigations, develop an investigation strategy and coordinate with other states.

For European states, supporting the efforts of the European Union’s joint investigation team through funding or participation. Membership in the team is open to all European Union member states.

Providing technical and financial support for Ukrainian human rights documentation efforts. This can strengthen their ability to document and store evidence, and to safeguard the security of victims, witnesses and investigators.

Providing technical and financial support to investigating organizations to help them protect the evidence they have gathered against Russian cyberattacks. Russia has shown the capacity and will to conduct attacks that could aim to destroy evidence and undermine investigations.

The disparate investigations and their supporters should work to coordinate their collection of evidence to minimize the hazard of re-traumatizing and exhausting victims and witnesses. To the extent possible, supporters of accountability should help provide victims and witnesses with psychosocial support to facilitate their vital participation in accountability processes and to help them recover from trauma.

Effective accountability for war-related crimes is based on effective investigations. As atrocities unfold in Ukraine, it is incumbent on the international community to establish an investigation infrastructure capable of collecting and evaluating evidence of these crimes and, ultimately, of holding perpetrators accountable.",https://www.usip.org/publications/2022/04/ukraine-justice-war-crimes-must-begin-evidence

Von der Leyen: Russia’s actions appear to be war crimes

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says Russian forces appear to have committed war crimes by targeting civilians in Ukraine, adding that lawyers must investigate the alleged incidents.

“My instinct says: if this is not a war crime, what is a war crime? But I am a medical doctor by training and lawyers have to investigate carefully,” von der Leyen told reporters on board a train leaving Ukraine.

“I saw the photos, [Ukrainian prime minister] Denys Shmyhal showed me: killing people as they are walking by. We could also see with our own eyes, that the destruction in the city is targeted into the civilian lives. Residential buildings are no military target,” she said, referring to Bucha.

The Kremlin said on Tuesday that allegations that Russian forces had executed civilians in Bucha were a “monstrous forgery” aimed at denigrating the Russian army.

Sweden Democrats leader wants party to change on NATO membership if Finland applies to join alliance

The leader of Sweden’s second-biggest opposition party says he will suggest that his party change its stance towards favouring a Swedish membership of NATO, should neighbour Finland apply to join the alliance.

A change of stance by the Sweden Democrats party would mean a swing to a parliamentary majority in favour of long-neutral Sweden joining the alliance.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has prompted the two countries to consider joining, although Sweden is more hesitant than Finland which has a 1,300km (800-mile) border with Russia. The Finnish government has said it would clarify the next steps in the coming weeks regarding a possible decision to seek membership.

“Then [if Finland applies] my ambition is to go to the party council with a request that we change our mind,” Jimmie Akesson told Svenska Dagbladet, a local daily.

“What’s changed now is that Finland is very clearly moving towards a NATO membership and there are many indications this may happen in the near future. That, and the fact Ukraine, which is not a NATO member, is completely alone, has made me turn.”

Ukraine war disruptions send food prices to their highest ever: UN index

World food prices hit an all-time high in March following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – an agricultural powerhouse – a United Nations agency has said.

The disruption in export flows resulting from the invasion and international sanctions against Russia has spurred fears of a global hunger crisis, especially across the Middle East and Africa.

The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said its Food Price Index, which tracks monthly changes in international prices for a basket of commodities, averaged 159.3 points last month, up 12.6 percent from February. As it is, the February index was the highest level since its inception in 1990.

Killings in Mali underscore Russia’s ‘malign activity’ beyond Ukraine, UK ambassador

The UK deputy representative to the UN, James Kariuki, has said reports of the massacre in the Malian town of Moura underline the extent of “Russia’s malign activity around the world, beyond Ukraine”.

“We know that, as of early 2022, around 1,000 Russian mercenary personnel have been stationed across Mali. Just as the presence of Russian mercenaries drove an increase in human rights violations and abuses in the Central African Republic last year, we fear we are now seeing the same in Mali,” Kariuki told the UN’s Security Council.

A Human Rights Watch (HRW) investigation revealed about 300 civilians and suspected members of armed groups were allegedly executed in Moura during an operation by Malian forces and foreign fighters. HRW says several sources identified the foreign fighters as Russians.

Russian mercenaries have reportedly been deployed to Africa as part of the Wagner Group, a paramilitary unit that was also allegedly aiding Russian separatists in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region. Russia has consistently denied the group’s connection to the state.

The coal ban should cost Russia $4.4bn a year, the EU’s executive commission said.

US plans to starve Russia’s ‘war machine’: Official

The US is ramping up sanctions against Russia to deprive its “war machine” of money, US Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo has said, but added that curbing Moscow’s main source of funding – exports – will take time.

“What this means is that Russia will be deprived of the capital it needs to build up its economy, but also to invest in its war machine,” Adeyemo said in an interview with the Reuters news agency.

“Because of our ability to produce energy at home, we were able to ban the Russian import of oil to America rather quickly,” he said. “It’s going to take them more time but what they’re doing is they’re reducing their dependence over time.”

First Bushmaster vehicle is headed to Ukraine CANBERRA, Australia — The first of 20 Bushmaster armored vehicles has left Australia for Ukraine, one week after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy specifically requested the Australian-manufactured four-wheel drives. A Boeing C-17 Globemaster transport jet that can carry four Bushmasters left the east coast city of Brisbane for Europe on Friday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said. The 20 Bushmasters cost 50 million in Australian dollars, which is $37 million in U.S. dollars. The vehicles are in addition to $116 million in Australian dollars ($87 million in U.S. dollars) in military and humanitarian aid previously committed to Ukraine. Zelenskyy requested Bushmasters when he made a video address to the Australian Parliament on March 31. “And as soon as he asked, we said yes,” Morrison said. Share this -







Injured Fox News reporter pays tribute to colleagues killed in attack, details injuries A Fox News journalist who was wounded in an attack outside Kyiv that left two colleagues dead described his injuries for the first time Thursday and paid tribute to colleagues. The journalist, Benjamin Hall, said he had lost half of a leg, a foot and vision in one eye. One of his hands “is being put together,” and he lost much of his hearing, he said. “But all in all I feel pretty damn lucky to be here — and it is the people who got me here who are amazing!” he said in a tweet that included a photo of himself in a hospital bed wearing an eye patch. Hall also paid tribute to colleagues Oleksandra “Sasha” Kuvshynova and Pierre Zakrzewski, who were killed in the attack on their vehicle last month in Horenka. Kuvshynova, 24, was a journalist working as a consultant with the network. Zakrzewski was a longtime war zone photographer whom Hall said he had traveled the world with. “Working was his joy and his joy was infectious,” he said. “RIP.” According to a database maintained by the Committee to Protect Journalists, seven journalists are confirmed to have been killed in Ukraine since Russia invaded on Feb. 24.

WHO verifies more than 100 attacks on Ukraine health care during invasion Calling it a “grim milestone,” the World Health Organization said it has verified more than 100 attacks on health care in Ukraine since Russia invaded in February. “We are outraged that attacks on health care are continuing. Attacks on health care are a violation of international humanitarian law,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Thursday. The 103 attacks — 89 affecting health facilities and 13 affecting transportation, such as ambulances — have killed 71 people, the WHO said in a statement. Another 51 have been injured. Russia attacked and invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. This week there have been new outrage and accusations that Russia has committed war crimes after photos and videos of corpses in civilian clothes found in the Kyiv-area town of Bucha emerged, as well as witness accounts of arbitrary executions of civilians by Russian forces. A maternity hospital in Mariupol was attacked last month; the U.S. has cited that and other reported attacks on civilian targets in saying it has assessed that Russian forces have committed war crimes. Russian has denied targeting civilians, and it has claimed that both the attack on the hospital and the horrific scenes in Bucha were “staged.” Share this -

Kremlin spokesman admits ‘significant’ Russian losses, denies war crimes Russia has suffered “significant losses of troops” in Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday. “It is a huge tragedy for us,” Peskov told British broadcaster Sky News without elaborating on how many of its armed forces Russia had lost since it invaded its neighbor on Feb. 24. (Sky News is owned by Comcast, the parent company of NBC News.) He added that Russia had withdrawn its forces from the areas surrounding Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and the northern city of Chernihiv “as an act of goodwill to lift tension from those regions and to show Russia is ready to create comfortable conditions for the continuation of negotiations.” However, he insisted that the besieged southern city of Mariupol would be “liberated” from what he called “nationalistic” Ukrainian battalions. To justify Russia’s assault on Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin and other Russian leaders have claimed the action was taken to “denazify” the country and its leadership. Confronted with pictures from the town of Bucha, where Ukrainian officials estimate hundreds of civilians have been killed, houses have been destroyed and graves have been dug in backyards, Peskov denied that Russian troops “had something in common with these atrocities and dead bodies.” Calling the photos “fakes,” he said they “were made after Russian troops had withdrawn from the region.” Share this -
