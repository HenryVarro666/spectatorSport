Sanger']",2022-03-16 00:00:00,"ODESSA, Ukraine — Ukrainian forces carried out counter-offensives against Russian positions on Wednesday, seeking to inflict what one official called “maximum losses,” even as the invading Russian military stepped up its lethal attacks on cities.

In Mariupol, an airstrike destroyed a theater where about 1,000 people had taken shelter, according to city and regional administrators, and photos and videos posted online showed the burning wreckage of the building.

Officials in Mariupol, the besieged southern city that has suffered the most intense bombardment, said they could not yet estimate the number of casualties among civilians, who might have been in a bomb shelter beneath the theater. The strike came as 11,000 residents evacuated the city on Wednesday, according to its City Council.

In a video address to Ukrainians early Thursday morning, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine called for more sanctions against Russia and said it was a “terrorist state.”

“Our hearts are broken by what Russia is doing to our people,” he said, “to our Mariupol.”

After falling back under a relentless pounding over the war’s first weeks, Ukrainian troops tried to gain some momentum with counterattacks on Russian positions outside of Kyiv and in the Russian-occupied city of Kherson, in Ukraine’s south, a senior Ukrainian military official said.

Rather than seek to regain lost territory, Ukrainian forces tried to cause as much destruction and death as possible, attacking Russian troops and equipment with tanks, fighter jets and artillery, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military information.

“In the task of inflicting maximum losses, we’ve done excellently,” the official said.

American intelligence officials said their conservative estimate of Russian troop deaths was at least 7,000, a staggering number that carries implications for both combat effectiveness and morale. Western defense and intelligence agencies estimate that Ukraine also has suffered thousands of combatants killed.

Mr. Zelensky addressed Congress via video link on Wednesday, asking for more aid, and President Biden promised more weaponry. The administration plans to provide Ukraine with high-tech defensive weapons that are easily portable and require little training or logistical support to use, according to U.S. and European officials.

Meanwhile, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia falsely accused Ukraine of seeking weapons of mass destruction and asserted that what he called an “economic blitzkrieg” by the West, aimed at destroying Russia, had failed.

Mr. Putin also sneered at Russians who oppose the war, saying the Russian people could distinguish “true patriots from the scum and the traitors, and just to spit them out like a midge that accidentally flew into their mouths.”

In a televised videoconference with top officials, he once again falsely described the government in Kyiv, led by a Jewish president and prime minister, as being “pro-Nazi” and on its way to acquiring nuclear weapons. “Their aim, of course, would have been Russia,” he said.

And then he went deeper into unreality, accusing the government in Kyiv of disregard for the suffering of the Ukrainian people that his own forces were bombing every day.

“The fact that people are dying, that hundreds of thousands, millions have become refugees, that there is a real humanitarian catastrophe in cities held by neo-Nazis and armed criminals,” he said. “They’re indifferent.”

Ukrainian and Russian negotiators held a third consecutive day of talks on a possible settlement to the conflict, and in typical fashion, the Kremlin left a muddy picture of its intentions. Mr. Putin’s bellicose, often false statements, larded with World War II references, clashed with more conciliatory comments from his underlings.

But little appeared to have changed on the battlefield. The war in Ukraine, about to enter its fourth week, has become a grinding daily slog with little evidence of significant gains for either side.

Details of the Ukrainian offensive could not be fully established independently, though several top Ukrainian officials, including key aides to Mr. Zelensky, confirmed that the counterattacks were underway.

In Kyiv, missile strikes and heavy artillery sounded overnight and in the early morning on Wednesday in exchanges in the outlying suburbs that were notably heavier and louder than in previous days. Two people were wounded and a residential building was damaged in a strike that landed near the city zoo, the second time in two days that shells have landed close to the city center.

Satellite pictures from Tuesday showed heavy black smoke above the Kherson airport, where the senior military official said Ukrainian forces had targeted parked Russian military aircraft.

Kherson was the first (and so far, only) major city to be fully taken over by Russian forces, which have turned it into a forward military base from which they have launched attacks on surrounding cities and villages, according to Ukrainian officials. On Tuesday, the Russian Defense Ministry announced that it had taken control of the entire Kherson region, giving Russian forces a significant foothold in southern Ukraine that Ukraine’s military will have difficulty dislodging.

Even so, neither side can be said to have made much progress militarily. The Institute for the Study of War, which has been tracking developments closely, noted in a Tuesday evening assessment that, for nearly two weeks, Russian forces have not been conducting extensive simultaneous attacks that would allow them to seize control of multiple areas at once in Ukraine. And they are unlikely to do so in the next week, it said.

In the absence of significant military gains, Russian forces on Wednesday continued a campaign of terror against Ukrainian civilians.

At least 10 people were killed when a Russian strike hit a bread line in Chernihiv, a city north of Kyiv that has been subject to intense shelling by Russian troops seeking to move on the capital. Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office said in a statement that the attack occurred at about 10 a.m. as people were lined up at a grocery store. Photos released by the prosecutor’s office showed several bodies scattered around a dirt yard.

Using heavy artillery, cruise missiles and fighter jets, Russian forces have systematically targeted civilian areas with no military presence, striking apartment buildings, schools and hospitals in cities and villages all over a broad front in the north, east and south of Ukraine. The attacks may have killed thousands of civilians, though reaching a precise count of the dead has been impossible.

Saying it was “profoundly concerned” by Russia’s use of force, the International Court of Justice ordered Russia on Wednesday to suspend its military operations immediately, pending its full review of a case submitted by Ukraine last month. However, the order was not expected to lead to any immediate cessation in the onslaught.

According to the United Nations, at least 726 civilians have been killed, including 64 children, since the invasion began on Feb. 24, though its figures do not include areas where fighting has been heaviest, like Kharkiv and Mariupol. In Mariupol alone, which has been turned into a hellscape of burning and decimated buildings, local authorities say at least 2,400 have been killed, and probably far more.

In Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, the municipal emergency services agency first reported on Wednesday that 500 civilians had been killed since the war began, but then revised that number to 100 later in the day. In any case, the agency said in a statement on Facebook, the true number of deaths could be much higher, noting that emergency workers were continuing to scour the rubble of residential neighborhoods for more bodies, often under fire.

Mr. Zelensky’s appeal to Congress on Wednesday was in part a desperate effort to obtain the weaponry and defenses capable of fending off such attacks. Central to this appeal was a call for a no-fly zone to be imposed over Ukraine, aimed at preventing Russian fighter jets, which cause severe destruction, from operating over Ukrainian territory. “Close the sky” has become a rallying cry for Ukrainian officials and regular citizens.

“Russia has turned the Ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people,” Mr. Zelensky said.

Knowing that the request had little chance of being approved, given that it would thrust American pilots into direct confrontation with the Russians, Mr. Zelensky quickly pivoted to something to which Republicans and Democrats have been far more receptive: asking for more weapons to enable his people to keep up the fight themselves.

Mr. Biden announced $800 million in new military aid to Ukraine, including antiaircraft and antitank missiles, body armor, vehicles, drones and small arms, bringing to $2 billion the amount delivered or pledged since early last year. But as expected, he did not offer to deliver warplanes or enforce a no-fly zone.

The United States and its allies have relied primarily on financial sanctions that are already devastating the Russian economy.

Russian officials close to the talks said Wednesday there had been signs of progress, though even there, the picture was unclear. They said the idea of a neutral Ukraine, with a status like that of Sweden or Austria, was on the table, which their Ukrainian counterparts disputed.

Sergey V. Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, told a Russian television network that the status of the Russian language and Russian news outlets in Ukraine were under discussion, and that “there are concrete formulas that are close to being agreed on.”

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

Russian forces pressed their assault on Ukrainian cities on Friday, with new missile strikes and shelling on the capital Kyiv and the outskirts of the western city of Lviv, as world leaders pushed for an investigation into the Kremlin's repeated attacks on civilian targets, including schools, hospitals and residential areas.

Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said on the Telegram messaging service that several missiles hit a facility used to repair military aircraft and damaged a bus repair facility. One person was reportedly killed in the Lviv attack. Satellite photos showed the strike destroyed a repair hangar and appeared to damage two other buildings.

The missiles that hit Lviv were launched from the Black Sea, but two of the six that were launched were shot down, the Ukrainian air force's western command said on Facebook.

Not far from the Polish border and well behind the front lines, Lviv and the surrounding area have not been spared Russia's attacks, the worst of which killed nearly three dozen people last weekend at a training facility near the city. Meanwhile, the city's population has swelled by some 200,000 as people from elsewhere in Ukraine have sought shelter there.

Early morning barrages also hit a residential building in the Podil neighbourhood of Kyiv on Friday, killing at least one person, according to emergency services, who said 98 people were evacuated from the building. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said 19 were wounded in the shelling.

""This is a war crime by Putin,"" said Lyudmila Nikolaenko, visiting her son, who lived in one of the apartments hit. ""They say they aren't hitting regular people, they say we are firing at ourselves.""

Two others were killed when strikes hit residential and administrative buildings in the eastern city of Kramatorsk, according to the regional governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko.

Ukrainian officials also said a firefighter was killed when Russian forces shelled an area where firefighters were trying to put out a blaze in the village of Nataevka, in the Zaporizhzhia region.

Maj. Gen. Oleksandr Pavlyuk, who is leading the defence of the region around Ukraine's capital, said his forces are well-positioned to defend the city and vowed to never give up. ""We will fight until the end. To the last breath and to the last bullet.""

Meanwhile on Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin promised tens of thousands of people waving Russian flags at a soccer stadium in Moscow that the ""special operation"" would succeed.

""We know what we need to do, how to do it and at what cost. And we will absolutely accomplish all of our plans,"" Putin said.

Britain says Russia has a dangerous new strategy

British Chief of Defence Intelligence Lt. Gen. Jim Hockenhull warned that after failing to take major Ukrainian cities, Russian forces are shifting to a ""strategy of attrition"" that will entail ""reckless and indiscriminate use of firepower,"" resulting in higher civilian casualties and a worsening humanitarian crisis.

In city after city around Ukraine, hospitals, schools and buildings where people sought safety from the bombardment have been attacked.

Rescue workers continued to search for survivors in the ruins of a theatre that served as a shelter when it was blown apart Wednesday by a Russian airstrike in the besieged southern city of Mariupol. And in Merefa, near the northeast city of Kharkiv, at least 21 people were killed when Russian artillery destroyed a school and a community centre Thursday, a local official said.

Ukraine's state emergency service said a multi-storey teaching building was shelled on Friday morning in Kharkiv, killing one person, wounding 11 and trapping one person in the rubble.

The United Nations migration agency estimated Friday that nearly 6.5 million people have now been displaced inside Ukraine. That's on top of 3.2 million refugees who have already fled the country. The estimates come from the International Organization for Migration.

The UN human rights office (OHCHR) said on Friday that at least 816 civilians had been killed and 1,333 wounded in Ukraine through to Thursday. Most of the casualties were from explosive weapons such as shelling from heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems, as well as missile and airstrikes, OHCHR said.

The real toll is thought to be considerably higher, since OHCHR, which has a large monitoring team in the country, has not yet been able to verify casualty reports from badly hit cities such as Mariupol.

Biden, Xi speak as war rages on

Two key figures in determining the course of a war half a world away, U.S. President Joe Biden and China's Xi Jinping, spoke on Friday as the White House looks to deter Beijing from providing military or economic assistance for Russia's invasion.

Biden warned Xi there would be ""consequences"" if Beijing gave material support to Russia's invasion, the White House said, while both sides stressed the need for a diplomatic solution to the crisis.

In a video call that lasted just under two hours at a time of deepening acrimony between the world's two biggest powers, Biden detailed the efforts of the United States and its allies to respond to the invasion, including by imposing costs on Russia.

China on Friday again sought to highlight its calls for negotiations and donations of humanitarian aid, while accusing the United States of provoking Russia and fuelling the conflict by shipping arms to Ukraine.

""China has called for every effort to avoid civilian casualties all the time,"" Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told reporters at a daily briefing before the call. ""Which do the civilians in Ukraine need more: food and sleeping bags or machine guns and artillery? It's easy to answer.""

What's the latest from the port city of Mariupol?

WATCH | Mariupol, strategic southern city, damaged in hits from Russian forces: Mariupol mostly destroyed by Russian forces, theatre rescue efforts ongoing Duration 2:42 Officials in Mariupol, Ukraine, suggest as much as 90 per cent of the besieged city has been damaged or destroyed by relentless attacks from Russian forces, while reports emerge of survivors at a bombed theatre where hundreds of civilians had taken shelter. 2:42

Ukrainian officials said late Friday that the besieged southern port city of Mariupol lost its access to the Azov Sea, and Russian forces were still trying to storm the city. It was unclear whether they had seized it.



Earlier, Russia's Defence Ministry said it was ""tightening the noose"" around Mariupol and that fighting had reached the centre of the city. The mayor of Mariupol confirmed to the BBC that fighting had reached the city's centre, where some 400,000 people have been trapped for over two weeks, sheltering from bombardment that has cut electricity, heating and water supply.



Regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said around 35,000 people had managed to leave the city in recent days, many on foot or in convoys of private cars, but near-constant shelling was preventing humanitarian aid from getting through.



Nick Osychenko, the CEO of a Mariupol TV station, said that as he fled the city with six members of his family between the ages of four and 61, he saw dead bodies on nearly every block. ""We were careful and didn't want the children to see the bodies, so we tried to shield their eyes,"" he said. ""We were nervous the whole journey. It was frightening, just frightening.""

Hundreds of civilians were said to have taken shelter in a grand, columned theatre Mariupol when it was hit on Wednesday by a Russian airstrike. Satellite imagery on Monday from Maxar Technologies showed huge white letters on the pavement outside the theatre spelling out ""CHILDREN"" in Russian — ""DETI"" — to alert warplanes to the vulnerable people hiding inside.



Ukrainian human rights ombudswoman Lyudmyla Denisova on Friday said 130 people had been rescued so far from the rubble of the theatre. In a televised address, Denisova said rescue work was ongoing at the site. She said information was limited, but there are believed to be ""more than 1,300 people in these basements, in this bomb shelter.""

U.S. to examine potential war crimes

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday that American officials were evaluating potential war crimes and that if the intentional targeting of civilians by Russia is confirmed, there will be ""massive consequences.""

The United Nations political chief, undersecretary general Rosemary DiCarlo, also called for an investigation into civilian casualties, reminding the UN Security Council that international humanitarian law bans direct attacks on civilians.

She said many of the daily attacks battering Ukrainian cities ""are reportedly indiscriminate"" and involve the use of ""explosive weapons with a wide impact area."" DiCarlo said the devastation in Mariupol and Kharkiv ""raises grave fears about the fate of millions of residents of Kyiv and other cities facing intensifying attacks.""

In remarks early Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was thankful to Biden for additional military aid, but he would not get into specifics about the new package, saying he did not want Russia to know what to expect.

Zelensky said when the invasion began on Feb. 24, Russia expected to find Ukraine much as it did in 2014, when Russia seized Crimea without a fight and backed separatists as they took control of the eastern Donbas region. Instead, he said, Ukraine had much stronger defences than expected, and Russia ""didn't know what we had for defence or how we prepared to meet the blow.""

Talks ongoing, but difficult

Kyiv and Moscow reported progress in talks this week toward a political formula that would guarantee Ukraine security protection outside of the NATO alliance. But Ukraine said the need for an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal of Russian troops remained unchanged, and both sides accused each other on Friday of dragging out the talks.

Zelensky on Saturday called for more meaningful peace and security talks with Moscow, saying this was Russia's only chance to limit the damage from its mistakes in the wake of its invasion.

""The time has come for a meeting, it is time to talk,"" he said in a video released in the early hours of Saturday in Ukraine.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/russia-ukraine-missiles-airstrikes-war-1.6389343

The threatened expansion of the war alarmed world officials even as President Biden warned his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, against assisting Russia militarily or economically.

In a telephone call that lasted nearly two hours, Biden told Xi that China would suffer “consequences” if it came to Russia’s aid, the White House said. Beijing said Xi advocated for negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, and between the U.S. and Russia to address Moscow’s security concerns. China has repeatedly refused to condemn the invasion of Ukraine.

More civilians were killed or wounded in the besieged capital of Kyiv on Friday, and painstaking attempts to rescue any survivors from a bombed shelter in the battered port city of Mariupol continued, after more than 100 people came out of the ruins alive but hundreds more remained missing and possibly buried.

In Lviv, about 40 miles from the Polish border, missiles landed before sunrise at the decommissioned repair center outside the city’s airport, which is currently used only for military flights, according to Mayor Andriy Sadovyi, who said at least one person was injured in the attack.

In a Facebook post, Sadovyi said the strikes destroyed the building. He warned residents, who have become accustomed to daily air-raid sirens but often ignore them because their city has been largely spared from shelling, to be more vigilant in looking out for danger.

“Be careful, follow instructions when air-raid sirens alert,” he said.

Hours after the attack, plumes of smoke were still rising from the stricken facility on the western edges of Lviv. Several military vehicles converged on the site.

According to the Ukrainian Air Force, Russian forces launched six missiles from the Black Sea, two of which were intercepted.

Friday’s strikes marked the second time in a week that missiles have struck the Lviv area, which has been largely insulated from the war raging in the vicinity of the capital, Kyiv, and elsewhere in the country. A swarm of Russian cruise missiles early Sunday hit a military training facility northwest of Lviv, killing at last 40 Ukrainian military personnel.

Each of those attacks has raised the specter that Russian firepower, by accident or design, could hit neighboring Poland, whose NATO membership might trigger response by other European countries and the U.S. The United States recently beefed up its deployment of American troops in Poland and other countries on NATO’s eastern flank.

In Kyiv, residents awoke Friday to another airstrike that hit an apartment building. According to Ukraine emergency service officials, one person was killed and 19 were injured in a fire that engulfed the building after the attack on Podilskyi, a district northwest of the city center.

The attack brought to 222 the total death toll in Kyiv since Russia’s invasion of its neighbor began Feb. 24, the Kyiv city administration said.

Ukrainian officials said Friday that they had agreed with Russia on opening nine humanitarian aid and evacuation corridors in areas including the hard-hit southeastern city of Mariupol, where an airstrike injured at least 130 in a crowded bomb shelter this week, and the eastern city of Sumy, from which thousands of people have already escaped.

Some of the evacuation routes have routinely been blocked over the last several days, according to Ukraine. On Thursday, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said more than 2,000 people were bused out of Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia, about 150 miles away. That represents only a tiny fraction of Mariupol residents wishing to flee their blockaded city, where living conditions have grown increasingly desperate.

Negotiations between Ukraine and Russia have taken place every day this week, with no agreement on an end to the fighting. Earlier in the week, representatives for both sides cited progress in the talks, but in a call Friday with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Putin accused the Ukrainians of stalling. A readout of the conversation in TASS, the Russian state-owned news agency, said the Russian leader accused the “Kyiv regime” of trying to delay negotiations by “putting forward more and more unrealistic proposals.”

Putin has insisted that his own demands — including Ukraine’s “de-militarization” and its renunciation of any intention to join NATO or the European Union — be completely fulfilled before any cessation of armed hostilities.

Pursuit of NATO membership is enshrined in Ukraine’s constitution, but President Volodymyr Zelensky shifted on the issue this week, saying he accepts that the country will not join the alliance.

Zelensky tweeted Friday that aspirations to join the EU remain, saying he had a “substantial conversation” with Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm. Zelensky said the commission’s “opinion on [Ukrainian] application for EU membership will be prepared within a few months.”

Putin also claims Russian ownership of Crimea, which it annexed in 2014. The reclusive Russian leader, who has rarely appeared publicly since the invasion, spoke Friday at a Moscow stadium for a celebration of the eighth anniversary of the annexation. Moscow officials said 200,000 people attended the rally, which featured a singer performing the song “Made in the USSR,” whose lyrics open with “Ukraine and Crimea, Belarus and Moldova, it’s all my country.”

Praising Russian troops, Putin paraphrased the Bible and said: “There is no greater love than giving up one’s soul for one’s friends.” He repeated the false claim that the war was necessary to stop the “genocide” of Russian speakers.

Vereshchuk said Ukraine would not recognize the Crimean peninsula as part of Russia — which has been floated as a possible concession by Kyiv to help bring an end to the war.

“Recognition of Crimea as Russian is impossible. Too much blood and sacrifices have already been spilled on our part to keep Ukrainian territory intact and undivided,” Vereshchuk said on Facebook.

She reiterated Kyiv’s demands for a cease-fire, the complete withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory and a new agreement that would ensure Ukraine’s security in the future.

Throughout three weeks of bombardment, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have fled their country’s eastern regions for Lviv, Kyiv and other areas in the west. But local residents say the daily rocket attacks on the capital’s residential neighborhoods have made them feel less safe even as Russian forces are stalled outside the city. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said a kindergarten and a school were damaged, along with at least six other buildings, in Friday’s strike on a residential building.

“It’s a war against civilians. … It’s just apartments,” not a military installation, Klitschko told reporters.

He said he expected Kyiv to come under stronger onslaught: “If you look in Mariupol, if you look in Kharkiv, if you look in other cities — Chernihiv, right now — where ... the city will be destroyed, I expect the Russians [will] do it exactly the same way in Kyiv.”

World & Nation Full coverage of the war in Ukraine Russia’s war in Ukraine is causing a European refugee crisis on a scale not seen since World War II and raising fears of a return to Cold War-era dynamics.

The impact of Friday’s explosion in Kyiv’s Podilskyi district could be seen far beyond the large crater it left in the central courtyard outside a number of apartment buildings. That courtyard was carpeted with glass granules, hunks of masonry and metal. The shock wave ripped through the buildings around it, popping window frames out of the walls, pulverizing glass and turning furniture into jumbles of wood and metal.

A supermarket more than 500 feet away from the crater had its windows blown out, with shelves laden with syrup bottles and gumdrops displaced by the force of the explosion.

Residents packed bags to evacuate. Evgenia Gavrylenko, a bank teller who lived on the fourth floor of one building, had her suitcases laid out on the bed of her guest room, the one area that seemed to have escaped the destruction. She used an expletive to describe Russian President Vladimir Putin as she took a drag of her cigarette and looked around her apartment.

On the floor above, one man was boarding up his residence while Skyping with his wife and daughter to show them the destruction. Outside, others lugged bags and suitcases.

In the port city of Mariupol, officials said the rescues continued after airstrikes this week on a theater where more than 1,000 people were sheltering. The death toll at the theater, which had the word “children” written on the ground outside of it, was still unknown.

Sergiy Taruta, a Ukrainian lawmaker and former regional official, said in a television interview that it was a struggle to rescue individuals because Russian attacks have decimated the city’s resources.

“People are doing everything themselves. My friends went to help, but due to constant shelling it was not safe. People are clearing away the rubble themselves,” Taruta said. “There is no rescue operation, because all the services that are supposed to rescue people, to treat them, to bury them — these services no longer exist.”

The war, now in its 23rd day, has sent more than 3.1 million people fleeing Ukraine.

The United Nations has counted 816 civilians killed — at least 52 of them children — since the invasion started. U.N. officials acknowledge that the real number is likely far higher.

Twenty-one people were killed and 25 wounded Thursday after rockets slammed into the western Ukraine town of Merefa as Russia's bloody, struggling invasion dragged into its fourth week.

Merefa Mayor Veniamin Sitov said the assault destroyed a school and community center. Ten survivors were critically wounded, the local prosecutor’s office reported.

Later Thursday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken became the second high-level U.S. official in two days to accuse Russia of war crimes.

Merefa, a town of 20,000 people, is about 20 miles south of Kharkiv and has been victimized by its proximity to the sprawling regional jewel that Russia's military pounding has failed to vanquish.

Kharkiv has become one of the saddest stories of the war, a city of museums and universities that 1.4 million people call home. Now it is slowly but deliberately being torn apart as Russia's apparently stalled military pounds away at whatever targets its missiles can reach.

Similar storylines were unfolding across much of the country. In the battered southern port city of Mariupol, rescue efforts were underway Thursday following Russian airstrikes that ripped apart a theater. The building, serving as a makeshift shelter for hundreds of women and children, was bombed late Wednesday even though the word ""CHILDREN"" in Russian was laid out in giant letters in front and behind it.

“The building withstood the impact of a high-powered air bomb and protected the lives of people hiding in the bomb shelter,"" Ukraine’s ombudswoman Ludmyla Denisova said Thursday. Ukrainian parliament member Sergiy Taruta added on a social media post that ""people are coming out alive.""

The Kyiv Independent reported at least 130 survivors had been pulled from the wreckage. The rescue efforts were continuing.

“Our hearts are broken by what Russia is doing to our people, to our Mariupol,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.

REDUCED TO RUBBLE:Heartbreaking images explore Ukraine's devastated residential areas

Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for Russia’s Foreign Ministry, denied the bombing and said the military ""does not bomb cities.""

But Vadim Denisenko, an adviser to the Ukraine minister of Internal Affairs, said 90% of Mariupol has been destroyed or damaged and that almost no buildings have been left untouched. Most of the 400,000 residents remain in the city, he said.

""Evacuation and rescue efforts remain extremely difficult due to constant Russian shelling,"" Denisenko said. ""This is beyond a humanitarian disaster.""

►Russia said Thursday it won't ask the U.N. Security Council to vote Friday on its draft resolution on humanitarian relief for Ukraine, which has been criticized for making no mention of Moscow’s invasion. Russia instead will use the council session to again allege the U.S. has biological warfare laboratories in Ukraine, claims Washington says are disinformation and part of a potential “false-flag operation” by Moscow.

►The Ukraine military says it has captured about a thousand Russian servicemen and that an estimated 14,000 more have been killed in battle.

Blinken: 'There will be accountability for any war crimes'

Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday that he agrees with President Joe Biden that war crimes have been committed in Ukraine.

“Intentionally targeting civilians is a war crime,” he said at a White House news briefing. “I find it difficult to conclude that the Russians are doing otherwise.”

Blinken’s comments came a day after Biden called Russian President Vladimir Putin a “war criminal.” On Thursday, Biden called Putin ""a murderous dictator, a pure thug who is waging an immoral war against the people of Ukraine.""

Describing the recent attack on Ukrainians waiting in bread lines and the bombing of a theater where children were sheltered, Blinken said the U.S. is helping document potential war crimes for prosecution.

Asked what should happen to Putin if he’s found guilty, Blinken said he won’t get ahead of the investigation, but he promised there will be consequences.

“I can say with conviction that there will be accountability for any war crimes that are determined to have occurred,” he said.

Blinken pushed the Senate to confirm nominees who can help respond to the events in Ukraine, including a position important for refugees and a coordinator for sanctions policy.

Asked about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Blinken said he sees no signs that Putin is prepared to stop.

American killed in Chernihiv seeking medical care for partner

Secretary of State Antony Blinken reported Thursday the death of an American in the war but did not identify the person. The victim's sister provided details in a Facebook post.

“My brother Jimmy Hill was killed yesterday in Chernihiv, Ukraine. He was waiting in a bread line with several other people when they were gunned down” by Russian military forces, wrote his sister, Cheryl Hill Gordon. “His body was found in the street by the local police.”

Ukrainian officials had previously said 10 people in a bread line were killed Wednesday in Chernihiv, a city of 285,000 people in the northern part of the country. Hill was the second U.S. citizen known to die in the war, after the killing of journalist and filmmaker Brent Renaud last week.

Hill, a Minnesota native believed to be 67, identified himself in a Facebook post as a lecturer at universities in Kyiv and Warsaw, Poland, and said he was in Chernihiv with his partner seeking medical treatment for her.

“Nobody in Chernihiv is safe. Indiscriminate bombing,'' he wrote March 2, less than a week into the war. ""Ukrainian forces hold city but are surrounded. It’s a siege here. Nobody in. Nobody out.”

WHO confirms 43 attacks on health care facilities

Among the most condemned attacks of the Russian invasion was last week's airstrike on a maternity hospital in Mariupol that killed three people and left 17 injured.

The World Health Organization says that's just one of 43 confirmed attacks on hospitals and health care facilities by Russian forces since the war began. Those aggressions have killed 12 and injured 34.

“The life-saving medicine we need right now is peace,” WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the United Nations Security Council in a virtual briefing.

Russian ground advance remains stalled: They 'weren’t ready for pushback'

Russia continues struggling to feed, supply and rearm the troops it sent to invade Ukraine, according to a senior Defense Department official.

Poor planning and stiff resistance from Ukrainians has basically frozen the Russian advance three weeks after their invasion, the official said Thursday on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence assessments.

The official termed the Russian military situation in Ukraine “extraordinary,” noting that commanders are discussing how to resupply and reinforce the more than 150,000 troops that began amassing on Ukraine’s border in the fall.

The stalled invasion indicates the Russians didn’t properly plan for the war, lack good logistics and are facing stiffer resistance than expected, the official said. They “weren’t ready for pushback.”

Anecdotal indications show flagging morale among some Russian troops, the official said, attributing the morale issue to poor leadership, lack of communication with troops and disillusionment from fierce Ukrainian resistance.

Ukrainian fighters have stalled Russia’s advance about 10 miles from Kyiv’s city center, the official said. Russia appears to be moving artillery units closer to that front line, where they are expected to shell the city and try to wear it down, the official said.

Part of the latest military aid package approved by President Joe Biden will aid Ukrainians in attacking Russian forces attempting to besiege Kyiv, the official said. The shipments will include tactical drones.

China should wield its influence on Russia for the better, Blinken says

China has a particular responsibility to use its influence on Russia, Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters the day before President Joe Biden is scheduled to talk with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

But rather than defending the international rules it professes to support, Blinken said, China is instead moving in the opposite direction by refusing to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine while portraying itself as a neutral arbiter.

The U.S. is also concerned that China is considering directly assisting Russia with military equipment, something both China and Russia have denied.

During Friday’s call, Blinken said, Biden will make clear to Xi that China will bear responsibility for any actions it takes to support Russia's aggression.

“And,” he said, “we will not hesitate to impose costs.”

Baltic nations warn they could be next

The three leaders of legislative foreign affairs committees in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania warned U.S. lawmakers Thursday that Russia would remain a worldwide threat for years and could attack their Baltic region after Ukraine. The foreign lawmakers told the Helsinki Commission, made up of U.S. lawmakers and executive branch officials, that the Baltic countries haven’t been attacked yet because they belong to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which the U.S. and Europe have pledged to defend. But the lawmakers urged the U.S. to provide more troops, ground-based anti-aircraft weapons and fighter jets to protect them from neighboring Russia.

“We are not peripheral, we are the frontier where democracy for the entire Western world has to stand or fall,” Latvian lawmaker Rihards Kols said. “This will be a marathon, not a sprint.""

Schwarzenegger posts video urging Putin, Russians to end violence

Arnold Schwarzenegger urged Russia's government, military and citizens to end the war in a nine-minute video shared Thursday to social media. The former governor of California shared his appreciation of the Russian people and aimed to dispel misinformation to Russian citizens and military members by sharing ""the truth"" of why Russia invaded Ukraine.

Schwarzenegger shot down claims from the Russian government that the purpose of their invasion was to ""denazify Ukraine"" and shared heartbreaking images and video of buildings that had been bombed.

""To the soldiers who are listening to this, remember that 11 million Russians have family connections to Ukraine,"" he said. ""So every bullet you shoot, you shoot a brother or a sister. … And to President Putin, I say: You started this war. You are leading this war. You can stop this war.""

DHS chief Mayorkas says Russian cyberattacks on US haven't increased during war

Alejandro Mayorkas, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said Thursday the agency hasn’t detected additional Russian cyberattacks on critical infrastructure in the U.S. after the invasion of Ukraine, but has educated local officials and private businesses about how to protect against potential attacks.

“We have not seen an attack on the homeland that is tied to the Russian invasion of Ukraine,” Mayorkas told reporters during an online news conference, although Russian cyber attacks have been confirmed against Ukraine and other countries. “We continue of course to see cyber activity in the United States, independent of that.”

The department saw a 300% increase in ransomware incidents last year compared with a year earlier, for a combined $300 million in losses.

To educate local officials and private businesses, the department created a web site called Shields Up to distribute information about how to prevent the threat. Some of the advice includes using simple methods such as backing up files, changing passwords often and setting up multi-factor authentication.

Interest is high. The department has held 80 virtual meetings on the subject and one featured 9,000 participants, Mayorkas said.

“We provide tactics and techniques that Russian cyber actors have used in the past, so that people can patch any vulnerabilities, strengthen their defenses and be ready,” Mayorkas said.

The secretary also said DHS has reminded Border Patrol agents that Ukrainian refugees from the war arriving in the U.S. could receive an exception to health restrictions that might otherwise bar their entry into the country.

WNBA star Brittney Griner to remain in Russian custody until May 19

WNBA star Brittney Griner, detained at a Moscow airport last month, will be held until at least May 19, the Russian state news agency Tass reported. Griner was detained after Russian authorities said a search of her luggage revealed vape cartridges. They were identified as containing oil derived from cannabis, which could carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison in Russia.

“The court granted the request of the investigation and extended the period of detention of the U.S. citizen Griner until May 19,” the court said.

The two-time Olympic gold medalist, 31, has played basketball in Russia for the last seven years in the winter, earning over $1 million per season – more than four times her WNBA salary. The WNBA season opens May 6.

Ukrainian men steel for battle as they say goodbye to families

LVIV, Ukraine – As millions of Ukrainian women and children move west to escape Russia's widening war in their country, a largely unspoken frontline – open-ended, full of searing psychological hurt – continues to expand across Ukraine: the men they leave behind.

Many of the women USA TODAY spoke to were too overcome with emotion to address the subject of leaving their husbands behind, but many Ukrainian men showed remarkable stoicism in talking about the pain of family separations that have no foreseeable end. They feel it is their duty to defend their country.

""My family understands that if we don't win this fight, future generations – maybe even the whole world – will not have a good life,"" said Igor Kotz, 37, a property developer turned amateur security chief for a Lviv-based humanitarian aid center that helps supply Ukraine's professional and civilian armed forces. His wife and children fled to Poland while he stayed to fight, and Kotz said, ""I have accepted that I may not ever see my wife and kids again."" Read more here.

6,182e5cee-c294-4327-beb6-4d2cac4e06ff,['Dan Mangan'],2022-03-16 00:00:00,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday invoked the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor and the Sept. 11 terror strikes on America as he pleaded directly with the U.S. Congress to send more aid to his embattled country to fight against Russia's invasion. Zelenskyy, who was greeted with at least three standing ovations from an audience of lawmakers, asked the U.S. to implement a no-fly zone over Ukraine to stem the Russian attacks, which have led to the deaths of thousands of people. ""This is a terror that Europe has not seen, has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for a reply, for an answer to this terror from the whole world,"" said Zelenskyy, who during his speech played a video showing the bombing of Ukraine and wounded and dead civilians. ""Is this a lot to ask for, to create a no-fly zone over Ukraine to save people? Is this too much to ask?"" he said via video link from the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.

Zelenskyy acknowledged that Western leaders have resisted the idea of a no-fly zone, which would require NATO to take over the air and shoot down enemies to protect civilians on the ground. It's been repeatedly rejected out of fears of triggering another world war. ""If this is too much to ask, we offer an alternative,"" he said. That included additional weapons and humanitarian support beyond what has already been granted to Ukraine, as well as even tougher sanctions on Russia and leading Russian supporters of that country's president, Vladimir Putin, he said.

""Constantly, every week, until the Russian military machine stops, restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based,"" Zelenskyy said, referring to additional sanctions. He also urged members of Congress to get companies in their legislative districts to leave the Russian market, ""because it is flooded with our blood."" ""I call on you to do more,"" he said. Referring to President Joe Biden by name, Zelenskyy said he wanted his American counterpart to lead the world, not just the U.S., in the face of Russian aggression. ""Being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace,"" Zelenskyy said. Biden is expected to announce hundreds of millions of dollars in additional aid to Ukraine later Wednesday. Zelenskyy was introduced for his address by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. ""Glory to heroes,"" Pelosi said in Ukrainian before he began speaking. Zelenskyy began by saying, ""I'm proud to greet you from Ukraine from our capital city ... that is under missile and airstrikes from Russian troops every day, but it doesn't give up."" ""And we have not even thought about it for a second. Just like many other cities, and communities in our beautiful country, which found themselves in the worst war since World War II,"" he said. Zelenskyy soon returned to that linkage with World War II after noting what he called America's foundational tenets of ""democracy, independence, freedom and care for everyone."" ""We in Ukraine want the same for our people,"" he said. ""All that is normal part of your own life.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/16/ukraine-president-zelenskyy-makes-speech-to-congress-on-russia-war.html

Gerashchenko said Russia wanted to test Ukraine’s coastal defense system.

He said there was no attempt to land troops. He didn’t say whether any of the shelling hit anything.

HERE’S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING TODAY:

LVIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine said a fourth Russian general has been killed in the fighting.

Maj. Gen. Oleg Mityaev died Tuesday during the storming of Mariupol, said Ukrainian Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko, who published a photo on Telegram of what he said was the dead officer.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported the death of another Russian general in his nighttime address but didn’t name him.

Mityaev, 46, commanded the 150th motorized rifle division and had fought in Syria, Gerashchenko said.

There was no confirmation of the death from Russia.

The employee of Russian state television who was arrested after interrupting a live news program by protesting the war in Ukraine said she was not allowed to sleep in police custody and was interrogated for 14 hours.

“These were very difficult days of my life because I literally went two full days without sleep, the interrogation lasted for more than 14 hours and they didn’t allow me to contact my family and close friends, didn’t provide any legal support,” Marina Ovsyannikova said after she was released.

Ovsyannikova, an employee of Channel 1, walked into the studio during Monday’s evening news show with a poster saying “stop the war, don’t believe the propaganda, they are lying to you here.” In English, it said “no war” at the top of the poster and “Russians against the war” at the bottom.

In a video recorded before her action, she urged Russians to join anti-war protests and said that “Russia is the aggressor country and one person, Vladimir Putin, solely bears responsibility for that aggression.”

She was fined 30,000 rubles (about $270) on charges of organizing unsanctioned actions for her call to take part in demonstrations against the war.

The state news agency Tass said Ovsyannikova was fined for the video, not for her appearance during the news show.

She remains under investigation for that on-air protest, Tass said, citing a law enforcement source. Tass said Ovsyannikova is being investigated under a new law against the dissemination of “deliberately false information” about the use of Russian armed forces, which carries a prison sentence of up to 15 years.

LVIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said early Wednesday that Russia’s demands during negotiations are becoming “more realistic” after nearly three weeks of war. He said more time was needed for the talks, which are being held by video conference.

“Efforts are still needed, patience is needed,” he said in his nighttime video address to the nation. “Any war ends with an agreement.”

Zelenskyy, who is to address the U.S. Congress on Wednesday, thanked President Joe Biden and “all the friends of Ukraine” for $13.6 billion in new support included in a spending measure that Biden signed.

He appealed for more weapons and more sanctions to punish Russia, and repeated his call to “close the skies over Ukraine to Russian missiles and planes.”

He said Russian forces on Tuesday were unable to move deeper into Ukrainian territory and continued their heavy shelling of cities.

Over the past day, 28,893 civilians were able to flee the fighting along nine humanitarian corridors, although the Russians refused to allow aid into Mariupol, he said.

LVIV, Ukraine -- Russian troops seized a hospital in Mariupol and took about 500 people hostage during another assault on the southern port city late Tuesday, regional leader Pavlo Kyrylenko said.

Russians troops drove 400 people from neighboring houses into Regional Intensive Care Hospital, Kyrylenko said on the messaging app Telegram. About 100 doctors and patients also are believed to be inside, he said.

The troops are using those inside the hospital as human shields and are not allowing anyone to leave, he said.

“It’s impossible to leave the hospital, they are shooting hard,” Kyrylenko said.

Kyrylenko said the main building of the hospital has been heavily damaged by shelling, but medical staff are continuing to treat patients in makeshift wards set up in the basement.

He called on the world to respond to these “gross violations of the norms and customs of war, these egregious crimes against humanity.”

The Ukrainian army’s General Staff says Russian troops are trying to block off the city from the western and eastern outskirts of the city. “There are significant losses,” it said in a Facebook post.

WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden will announce on Wednesday that the U.S. is delivering $800 million in new military assistance to Ukraine, according to a White House official.

Biden is expected to detail the assistance during a speech on the situation in Ukraine.

The money will come out of $13.6 billion in additional military and humanitarian aid allocated for Ukraine in a broader $1.5 trillion government spending measure that Biden signed on Tuesday.

With the new round of aid, Biden will have committed $2 billion in assistance to Ukraine since taking office.

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is also scheduled to deliver video remarks to Congress Wednesday morning.

While officials are anticipating that Zelenskyy could once again call on the U.S. and West to send Ukraine fighter jets or help establish a “no-fly” zone, the Biden administration is looking to send Ukraine “more of what’s been working well,” including anti-armor and air defense weapons, according to the official who was not authorized to comment and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

LYIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian forces on Tuesday evening repelled an attack on Kharkiv by Russian troops, who tried to storm the city from their positions in Piatykhatky, a suburb 15 kilometers (9 miles) to the north, the head of the Kharkiv region said.

The Ukrainian army was able “to push the enemy back beyond its previous position,” Oleh Synehubov said on the messaging app Telegram. He called it a “shameful defeat.”

There was no information about casualties on either side.

After dark, Russian forces increased their shelling of the eastern city, Ukraine’s second largest. On Tuesday morning, Synehubov had said Russian troops the previous night had fired more than 60 missiles at the historical center of the city.

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate has unanimously approved a resolution seeking investigations of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his regime for war crimes over the invasion of Ukraine.

Senators late Tuesday passed the resolution, which says the Senate strongly condemns the “violence, war crimes. crimes against humanity” being carried out Russian military forces. The measure does not carry the force of law, but encourages international criminal court investigations of Putin, his security council and military leaders.

“These atrocities deserve to be investigated for war crimes,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.

Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who spoke to Russian negotiators via video link on Monday and Tuesday, described the talks as “very difficult and sticky.”

He said that “there are fundamental contradictions,” but added that “there is certainly room for compromise.”

KYIV, Ukraine — A senior Ukrainian official says about 20,000 people have managed to leave the besieged port city of Mariupol.

Kyrylo Tymoshenko, a deputy head of office of Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the evacuees left Mariupol in private vehicles via a humanitarian corridor on Tuesday.

He said that 570 of some 4,000 vehicles that left the city have reached the city of Zaporizhzhia some 260 kilometers (160 miles) northwest while others will spend the night in various towns along the way.

Mariupol, a strategic port city of 430,000 on the Sea of Azov, has been besieged by Russian troops for more than 10 days, facing heavy shelling that has killed more than 2,300 people and left residents struggling for food, water, heat and medicine.

WASHINGTON — Russian ground troops have made limited progress over the last 24 hours in their effort to seize major cities in Ukraine, a senior defense official said Tuesday.

And as deadly airstrikes continue, the U.S. has seen indications that Russia may believe it needs more troops and supplies than it has on hand in the country, and is considering ways to get resources brought in, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss U.S. military assessments.

The official did not elaborate on the indications, and said that as of Tuesday, however, there has been no actual movement of reinforcement troops currently in Russia going into Ukraine.

According to the official, Russian ground forces are still about 15-20 kilometers (9-12 miles) northwest of Kyiv and 20-30 kilometers (12-19 miles) east of the city, which is being increasingly hit by long-range strikes. The official said Ukrainian troops continue to put up stiff resistance in Kharkiv and other areas.

Russia has launched more than 950 missiles so far in the war, and both Russia and Ukraine still retain about 90% of their combat power, the official said.

MEDYKA, Poland — Refugees continued to pour into Poland on Tuesday at a border crossing connecting Ukraine to the Polish village of Medyka.

Ludmila Deslichenko, 41, traveled from Cherkasy in central Ukraine.

“We would like to go back home as soon as the war ends and when there’s peace,” Deslichenko said. “It was very terrifying. There were bombs during the day, also rockets, everywhere in Ukraine. There were a lot of explosions. As soon as it calms down and the war is over, we will go back.”

Oksana Voloshen, 59, said she crossed the border to buy groceries to bring back to Mostyska in far western Ukraine.

“We have nothing in the shops,” she said.

Nicolas Kusiak, who leads NGOs and volunteers at the Medyka border crossing, said that while they’re seeing mostly refugees entering Poland, some are headed the other way.

“We have a lot of military, ex-military from all over the world, the (United) States, U.K., Germany, Denmark, even Poland, joining the international legion,” Kusiak said.

KYIV, Ukraine — A senior aide to Ukraine’s president says that Russia has softened its stance in the talks over a possible settlement.

Ihor Zhovkva, a deputy chief of staff to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said Tuesday that the talks between Russian and Ukrainian representatives have become “more constructive” and Russia has changed tone and stopped airing demands for Ukraine to surrender — something Russia had insisted upon during earlier stages of talks.

Three rounds of talks in Belarus earlier this month have been followed by video calls between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators, including the one on Tuesday.

Zhovkva said that Ukrainian representatives feel “moderately optimistic” after the talks, adding that it would be necessary for Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet to make major progress.

BRATISLAVA, Slovakia — Slovakia’s Parliament has approved a NATO plan to deploy up to 2,100 troops on Slovak territory following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The plan is part of the NATO initiative to reassure member countries on the alliance’s eastern flank by sending forces to help protect them.

Germany is supposed to contribute the biggest number of soldiers, up to 700, to the multinational battlegroup. The Czech Republic follows with 600 and the U.S. will send up to 400. The Netherlands, Poland and Slovenia will also contribute troops.

Their deployment together with the Patriot air defense system will increase the defensive capabilities of Slovakia’s armed forces.

The alliance stationed troops in the Baltic countries — Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — and Poland after the 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula by Russia. After Russia attacked Ukraine, NATO decided to boost its presence along the entire eastern flank by deploying forces in Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia.

MILAN — Italian museums said Tuesday that they had gotten a reprieve from a Russian request to immediately repatriate artworks on loan from the State Hermitage Museum of St. Petersburg.

The director of the State Hermitage Museum of St. Petersburg said in a message relayed Monday by the Hermitage Italia collection that an agreement had been reached with Russian cultural officials so that “the paintings of Titian and Picasso can continue to remain on the walls of museums,” at Palazzo Reale in Milan and the Fondazione Alda Fendi in Rome. The same goes for works on loan to the Gallerie d’Italia, owned by bank Intesa Sanpaolo, in Milan.

Russian cultural officials had requested the immediate repatriation of the works last week as cultural ties frayed along with the diplomatic tensions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The Hermitage director general, Michail Piotrovsky, expressed regret “that cultural relations between our countries have collapsed into such ‘darkness.’ It can recover only if we conserve an atmosphere of good will and benevolence. We always repeat that the bridges of culture are the last to blow up. It is time to protect them.”

BRUSSELS — NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg says he’s convened a summit for next week of the military organization’s 30 leaders to discuss Russia’s war on Ukraine.

Stoltenberg says the March 24 summit will be led by U.S. President Joe Biden and “will address the consequences of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, our strong support for Ukraine, and further strengthening NATO’s deterrence and defense in response to a new reality for our security.”

White House press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed that Biden will travel to Brussels for the face-to-face talks with European leaders.

The trip follows on Vice President Kamala Harris’ visit to eastern flank NATO countries of Poland and Romania last week to discuss with leaders the growing refugee crisis in eastern Europe sparked by the Russian invasion and to underscore the Biden administration’s support for NATO allies.

Stoltenberg said in a statement Tuesday that “at this critical time, North America and Europe must continue to stand together in NATO.” NATO has been bolstering its eastern flank with troops and equipment to deter Russia from invading any of its members. NATO refuses to deploy troops to Ukraine as it is concerned about sparking a wider war in Europe.

BRUSSELS — The European Union has slapped sanctions on Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich as part of a new package of measures targeting Russia.

The EU included the Russian oligarch in its updated list of individuals facing assets freeze and travel bans over their role in the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The 55-year-old Abramovich had already been punished in Britain by Boris Johnson’s administration last week. The aluminum magnate was among seven wealthy Russians who had their assets frozen under British sanctions in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Abramovich has also been suspended as director of the Premier League club.

The EU said Abramovich “has had privileged access to the president, and has maintained very good relations with him. This connection with the Russian leader helped him to maintain his considerable wealth.”

The Russian Foreign Ministry says Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly, Defense Minister Anita Anand and other Canadian officials have been put on a sanctions list.

The ministry said in Tuesday’s statement that they have been barred from entering Russia in retaliation to Canadian sanctions against the Russian leadership. The Russian sanctions also targeted Canadian lawmakers.

The ministry said the decision was a forced move taken in response to “hostile actions by the current Canadian regime that has long tested our patience.” The decision followed the announcement of Russian sanctions against U.S. President Joe Biden and senior members of his administration.

The Russian Foreign Ministry says Moscow is withdrawing from the Council of Europe.

The ministry said it handed a formal notice about Russia’s decision to leave the continent’s leading human rights organization to the Council of Europe’s Secretary General Marija Pejčinović Burić on Tuesday.

It said the move followed the Council of Europe’s decision to suspend Russia’s membership that was taken on Feb. 25.

The ministry charged that the Council of Europe has become an instrument of exerting pressure on Russia and alleged that it has been heavily influenced by NATO and the European Union. It said in a statement that its withdrawal from the Council of Europe wouldn’t impact human rights and freedoms in the country, which officials said are safeguarded by the Russian constitution.

Russia’s invasion has sparked widespread allegations of war crimes, as hundreds of Ukrainian civilians have been killed and numerous residential areas have been targeted by Russian troops.

The Kremlin says that President Vladimir Putin has discussed the situation in Ukraine with European Council President Charles Michel.

The Kremlin said in a statement that Putin informed Michel about the Russian view of the talks with Ukraine in Tuesday’s call, adding that Ukrainian officials haven’t yet “demonstrated a serious intention to search for mutually acceptable solutions.”

Michel said on Twitter that he told Putin about the “urgent need to stop Russia’s fratricidal war against Ukraine” and emphasized that “indiscriminate shelling by Russian forces of Ukraine civilians must stop.” He added that “Russia must urgently enable humanitarian access and safe passage.

WARSAW — During a news conference with foreign journalists on Monday in Warsaw, Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski said that while solidarity for Ukrainian refugees remains strong, steps must be taken to avoid a backlash.

More than 1.8 million refugees have fled to Poland. Around 390,000 people have traveled to Warsaw, where 300,000 displaced Ukrainians remain. Warsaw has become a major transfer point for Ukrainian refugees fleeing the Russian invasion. Its central train station has become a hub for people awaiting transport further West.

“I need to take care of the normal functioning of the city, because the more problems we have, the more our attention is diverted to other issues for longer, then we will start having problems in schools and hospitals and elsewhere,” he told reporters.

BELGRADE, Serbia — Another flight from Belgrade to Moscow has received a bomb threat that turned out to be false, Serbia’s police said Tuesday.

Unlike two other threats since Friday, this time it came before the plane took off. On Friday and Monday, the aircraft had to turn back shortly after takeoff for inspection.

The police said Tuesday they are investigating the third false claim in five days.

Serbian state media say the threatening emails came from Ukraine.

Besides Turkish carriers, Serbia’s national airline AirSerbia is the only airline in Europe still flying to and from Russia.

Serbia, which formally seeks European Union membership but has maintained close relations with ally Russia, has refused to join an international flight ban against Moscow in response to the war in Ukraine.

UNITED NATIONS — Russia has circulated a proposed U.N. Security Council resolution demanding protection for civilians “in vulnerable situations” in Ukraine and safe passage for humanitarian aid and people seeking to leave the country — but it makes no mention of Russia’s responsibility for the war against its smaller neighbor.

The draft resolution released Tuesday expresses “grave concern” at the deteriorating humanitarian situation and reports of civilian casualties in and around Ukraine. It endorses U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ call for dialogue and negotiations and calls for a negotiated cease-fire to rapidly evacuate “all civilians,” and underscores “the need for the parties concerned to agree on humanitarian pauses to this end.”

The draft, which never identifies “the parties concerned,” could be put to a vote as early as Wednesday, according to a Russian diplomat who was not authorized to speak publicly because discussions have been private.

The Russian measure was circulated a day after France and Mexico announced that a humanitarian resolution on Ukraine they co-sponsored, which had been discussed for two weeks in the Security Council, was being moved to the 193-member General Assembly for discussion and a vote.

That draft resolution called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and deplored the dire humanitarian consequences of the hostilities in Ukraine, provisions which are not in the proposed Russian resolution. The France-Mexico resolution would almost certainly have led to a Russian veto in the Security Council, but there are no vetoes in the General Assembly.

Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told reporters that his country is prepared to support a humanitarian resolution and after Monday’s announcement by the French and Mexican ambassadors Russia thinks “the chances are still there,” so he was putting forward its “roadmap” and will see whether the council adopts it.

TORONTO — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asked Canadians to imagine bombs landing in their communities as he told the Canadian Parliament that his people want to live.

Zelenskyy urged Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Canadian lawmakers to help enact a no-fly zone over the Ukraine and called for greater economic pressure on Russia.

“Justin, can you imagine you and your children hearing all these severe explosions, the bombing of the airport, the bombing of the Ottawa airport,” Zelenskyy said. “Cruise missiles are falling down and your children are asking you, ‘What happened?’”

Speaking by video from Ukraine to a packed Canadian House of Commons chamber, Zelenskyy said the Russian war is designed to annihilate Ukraine and subjugate its people.

Zelenskyy evoked British wartime leader Winston Churchill as he told the U.K. Parliament last week that his country would fight Russia’s invasion to the end. Zelenskyy will also speak Wednesday to members of the U.S. House and Senate, an event that will be livestreamed for the public.

MYKOLAIV, Ukraine — In Mykolaiv, a southern Ukraine city bordering the Black Sea, walls of sandbags with mannequins for decoys are placed at checkpoints. A high sandbag wall protects the front of a building serving as a support center for the military.

Rodyin Lavrushin is a volunteer at the center. He lifted a tarp covering plastic crates filled with Molotov cocktails.

“Here we collect everything from food to clothes and military specifics and help our military because the Russian occupiers came here to our home and we will protect it to the end.” Lavrushin said Monday.

Mykolaiv resident Svetlana Gryshchenko said her son was killed Feb. 26 in the Donetsk region.

“He went there to the military command,” Gryshchenko said. “He was a soldier and he’d just turned 24. He went there to work (with the military), not to fight.”

“What is happening now in Mykolaiv cannot be described through words,” Gryshchenko said. “We are bombed during the day and during the night. We are peaceful citizens, and I cannot put it into words. It is impossible to put into words. It’s a nightmare what Russia is doing on the territory of Ukraine.”

Outside the Mykolaiv city morgue, bodies placed in plastic bags lie on the ground because the building had no room for more of the dead.

NEW YORK — Fox News says one of its video journalists was killed in Ukraine when the vehicle he was traveling in was struck by incoming fire.

The network said Tuesday that videographer Pierre Zakrzewski was killed in an incident that also injured reporter Benjamin Hall, who remains hospitalized. Their injuries occurred Monday in Horenka, outside of Kyiv.

Zakrzewski was a veteran journalists who had covered conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria for Fox. Suzanne Scott, CEO of Fox News Media, said in a memo to staff members on Tuesday that “his passion and talent as a journalist were unmatched.”

He won an internal award at Fox for helping to get freelancers and their families out of Afghanistan after the U.S. withdrawal last year.

He was the second journalist killed in Ukraine in two days, following the death of documentary filmmaker Brent Renaud.",https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-kyiv-business-global-trade-europe-d3fc8e510956c63a8d7b53efb8700c9e

LVIV, Ukraine -- Russian forces pressed their assault on Ukrainian cities Friday, with new missile strikes and shelling on the edges of the capital Kyiv and the western city of Lviv, as world leaders pushed for an investigation of the Kremlin's repeated attacks on civilian targets, including schools, hospitals and residential areas.Outside Lviv, black smoke billowed for hours after the early morning strike by several missiles, which the mayor said hit a facility for repairing military aircraft near the city's international airport, also damaging a bus repair facility. No casualties were immediately reported. The facility had suspended work ahead of the attack, said the mayor, Andriy Sadovyi, on the Telegram messaging app.A soldier standing guard near the site said he heard three blasts in quick succession around 6 a.m. A nearby resident described his building vibrating from the explosions and people panicking.The missiles that hit Lviv were launched from the Black Sea, but two of the six that were launched were shot down, Ukrainian air force's western command said on Facebook.Not far from the Polish border and well behind the front lines, Lviv and the surrounding area have not been spared Russia's attacks. In the worst, nearly three dozen people were killed last weekend in a strike on a training facility near the city. Meanwhile, Lviv's population has swelled by some 200,000 as people from elsewhere in Ukraine have sought shelter there.Early morning barrages also hit on the northern edges of Kyiv. At least one person was killed by shelling on Podil, a neighborhood just north of downtown Kyiv, according to emergency services. It was not immediately known what was hit in the bombardment.In city after city around Ukraine, hospitals, schools and buildings where people sought safety from the bombardment have been attacked. Rescue workers searched for survivors in the ruins of a theater that served as a shelter when it was blown apart by a Russian airstrike in the besieged southern city of Mariupol. And in Merefa, near the northeast city of Kharkiv, at least 21 people were killed when Russian artillery destroyed a school and a community center, a local official said.In the northern city of Chernihiv, dozens of bodies were brought to the morgue in just one day.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday that American officials were evaluating potential war crimes and that if the intentional targeting of civilians by Russia is confirmed, there will be ""massive consequences.""The United Nations political chief, Undersecretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo, also called for an investigation into civilian casualties, reminding the U.N. Security Council that international humanitarian law bans direct attacks on civilians.She said many of the daily attacks battering Ukrainian cities ""are reportedly indiscriminate"" and involve the use of ""explosive weapons with a wide impact area."" DiCarlo said the devastation in Mariupol and Kharkiv ""raises grave fears about the fate of millions of residents of Kyiv and other cities facing intensifying attacks.""In Mariupol, hundreds of civilians were said to have taken shelter in a grand, columned theater in the city's center when it was hit Wednesday by a Russian airstrike. More than a day later, there were no reports of deaths and conflicting reports on whether anyone had emerged from the rubble. Communications are disrupted across the city and movement is difficult because of shelling and other fighting.Satellite imagery on Monday from Maxar Technologies showed huge white letters on the pavement outside the theater spelling out ""CHILDREN"" in Russian - ""DETI"" - to alert warplanes to the vulnerable people hiding inside.""We hope and we think that some people who stayed in the shelter under the theater could survive,"" Petro Andrushchenko, an official with the mayor's office, told The Associated Press. He said the building had a relatively modern basement bomb shelter designed to withstand airstrikes. Other officials said earlier that some people had gotten out.Video and photos provided by the Ukrainian military showed that the at least three-story building had been reduced to a roofless shell, with some exterior walls collapsed.Across the city, snow flurries fell around the skeletons of burned, windowless and shrapnel-scarred apartment buildings as smoke rose above the skyline.""We are trying to survive somehow,"" said one Mariupol resident, who gave only her first name, Elena. ""My child is hungry. I don't know what to give him to eat.""She had been trying to call her mother, who was in a town 50 miles (80 kilometers) away. ""I can't tell her I am alive, you understand. There is no connection, just nothing,"" she said.Cars, some with the ""Z"" symbol of the Russian invasion force in their windows, drove past stacks of ammunition boxes and artillery shells in a neighborhood controlled by Russian-backed separatists.Russia's military denied bombing the theater or anyplace else in Mariupol on Wednesday.In Chernihiv, at least 53 people were brought to morgues over 24 hours, killed amid heavy Russian air attacks and ground fire, the local governor, Viacheslav Chaus, told Ukrainian TV on Thursday.Ukraine's emergency services said a mother, father and three of their children, including 3-year-old twins, were killed when a Chernihiv hostel was shelled. Civilians were hiding in basements and shelters across the embattled city of 280,000.""The city has never known such nightmarish, colossal losses and destruction,"" Chaus said.The World Health Organization said it has verified 43 attacks on hospitals and health facilities, with 12 people killed and 34 injured.In remarks early Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he was thankful to President Joe Biden for additional military aid, but he would not get into specifics about the new package, saying he did not want Russia to know what to expect. He said when the invasion began on Feb. 24, Russia expected to find Ukraine much as it did in 2014, when Russia seized Crimea without a fight and backed separatists as they took control of the eastern Donbas region.Instead, he said, Ukraine had much stronger defenses than expected, and Russia ""didn't know what we had for defense or how we prepared to meet the blow.""In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of the Group of Seven leading economies accused Putin of conducting an ""unprovoked and shameful war,"" and called on Russia to comply with the International Court of Justice's order to stop its attack and withdraw its forces.Both Ukraine and Russia this week reported some progress in negotiations. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that some negotiators were breaking into working groups.Zelenskyy said he would not reveal Ukraine's negotiating tactics.""Working more in silence than on television, radio or on Facebook,"" Zelenskyy said. ""I consider it the right way.""While details of Thursday's talks were unknown, an official in Zelenskyy's office told the AP that on Wednesday, the main subject discussed was whether Russian troops would remain in separatist regions in eastern Ukraine after the war and where the borders would be.The official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive talks, said Ukraine was insisting on the inclusion of one or more Western nuclear powers in the negotiations and on legally binding security guarantees for Ukraine.In exchange, the official said, Ukraine was ready to discuss a neutral military status.Russia has demanded that NATO pledge never to admit Ukraine to the alliance or station forces there.The fighting has led more than 3 million people to flee Ukraine, the U.N. estimates. The death toll remains unknown, though Ukraine has said thousands of civilians have died.___",https://abc7.com/ukraine-news-russia-war-vladimir-putin/11660996/
