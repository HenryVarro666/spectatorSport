Spurred by reports of Russian atrocities outside Ukraine’s capital, and alarmed at signs that Russia’s invasion force is about to escalate assaults in eastern Ukraine, many civilians in that region are fleeing while they can, officials said Wednesday.

“The cities of the Luhansk region are in ruins,” warned one eastern governor. “Thousands of residents have not yet left. Get out of the way!”

The exodus accelerated as Western nations moved to provide more weapons to Ukraine’s military and further ostracize Russia economically with new sanctions, including restrictions on its leading banks and on the assets of President Vladimir V. Putin’s children.

The new sanctions are a response to outrage and revulsion over the atrocities, including executions and torture, that appear to have been carried out by Russian forces before they retreated from areas outside Kyiv in the past few weeks. Russia has denied responsibility, saying the atrocities were fabricated or were committed by the Ukrainians themselves.

The European Union also was weighing a ban on coal from Russia, the leading provider of fossil-fuel energy to Europe, and Russia appeared to move closer to default on its foreign debt because of U.S. currency restrictions.

“Together with our allies and our partners, we’re going to keep raising the economic costs and ratchet up the pain for Putin, and further increase Russia’s economic isolation,” said President Biden, who has described Mr. Putin as a war criminal and suggested he should not remain in power.

More than 11 million Ukrainians — roughly one in four — have fled their homes since the Feb. 24 invasion, according to the United Nations, including more than four million who have fled the country. It is the biggest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.

The Russian military announced last week that it would focus its campaign on eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting for eight years. The redeployment came as the Russians, hampered by botched planning and fierce Ukrainian military resistance, retreated from the Kyiv area and apparently abandoned — at least for now — any effort to capture the capital in their war to subjugate the former Soviet republic.

Western military analysts have said the Russians vastly underestimated the challenges in Ukraine and that their initial invasion force of more than 150,000 has been weakened by losses, exhaustion and low morale. But that does not mean Russia’s military cannot undertake a powerful new assault in eastern Ukraine.

The shift has accelerated civilian displacement in the east. Thousands of people have been leaving, according to Ukrainian officials, and photos and videos posted online. Ukrainian officials say Russian troops have been massing in the Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv regions.

In Kramatorsk, a city in the north of the Donetsk region, photos showed crowds of people huddled at a platform in a central train station.

At least two people were killed and five injured when Russian forces launched a strike on a humanitarian aid site in the town of Vugledar in the Donetsk region, according to Pavlo Kyrylenko, the Donetsk governor.

Russian forces now control 60 percent of the town of Rubizhne, in the Luhansk region, according to the governor there, Serhiy Haidai, who said the attackers had scaled up their offensive this week.

“Evacuations are taking place under the roar of enemy guns,” Mr. Haidai wrote in a Facebook post on Wednesday, saying that approximately 30,000 people had left the region since Russia invaded. He urged remaining residents to flee before Russia scaled up attacks.

Oleg Synegubov, the state administrator for the Kharkiv military region, said Wednesday in a post on Telegram that the army would evacuate two towns in the eastern part of the country because fighting was escalating there.

The towns, Lozova and Barvinkove, are southwest of Izium, a city Russian forces seized as part of an apparent drive toward Sloviansk, which military analysts say is strategically critical to Russia’s plan to gain full control of eastern Ukraine.

Earlier this week, Oleksiy Danilov, the head of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, speaking on national television, said “large groupings of Russian troops” had been massing in the region.

“They are not going to stop,” he said. “They have a great desire to create big problems for our armed forces in this direction, and we also expect that fierce battles will be fought there for our territory in the near future.”

The Pentagon’s assessment of Russian deployments appeared to corroborate what Ukrainian officials were saying. Pentagon officials said Russia had withdrawn all of its troops arrayed against Kyiv and another city in the north, Chernihiv, and sent them back to Russia or to its ally Belarus to rearm, resupply and possibly redeploy in eastern Ukraine.

The Pentagon officials said those forces included as many as 40,000 troops that, in many cases, had departed under fierce attack from the Ukrainian military units that retook the territory.

“We believe they are all out,” one senior Pentagon official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential operational issues.

Russia now has about 30 battalion tactical groups — as many as 30,000 troops — in the east, the senior Pentagon official said. Earlier this week, Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden’s national security adviser, said Russia would most likely send “tens of thousands of soldiers to the front line in Ukraine’s east” in the coming weeks.

Largely in anticipation of this next major phase of the war, the Pentagon announced late Tuesday that it was sending $100 million worth of Javelin anti-tank missiles — roughly several hundred missiles — to Ukraine, where the weapon has been used with high success in destroying Russian tanks and other armored vehicles.

NATO foreign ministers, meeting this week, have been discussing how to further help Ukraine prosecute the war without entangling the alliance in direct combat with Russian forces.

The war, they said, is far from over, noting that however badly Russia’s forces have performed, and their retreat from areas around Kyiv notwithstanding, they are making slow and brutal progress in the east.

“Moscow is not giving up its ambitions in Ukraine,” said Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary general.

Ukrainian officials in a number of areas, including Mykolayiv in the south and the Luhansk and Donetsk regions in the east, have been sharing schedules of planned evacuations or links to online portals for people to sign up to join buses and trains that are transporting residents to safer places.

But in some besieged cities in the south, like Mariupol, it is already nearly impossible to leave, making evacuations sporadic and risky.

Attempts by the Red Cross to enter Mariupol to supervise civilian departures have repeatedly been scrubbed, leaving fearful residents to fend for themselves. On Wednesday, 500 people who had escaped Mariupol to join a Red Cross convoy in the nearby city of Berdyansk arrived in Zaporizhzhia, about 100 miles away.

The climate of fear gripping Mariupol has spread to the region of Kherson, near the Black Sea, where people have lived under occupation by Russian forces since they encircled and entered the city and its suburbs on March 2.

“Anyone who did not leave early is now stuck here,” said Evgeniya Selivantseva, a doctor from Velyka Lepetyka, a village on the Dnipro River, in the Kherson region.

Dr. Selivantseva, 38, described a deepening humanitarian crisis in the village: Gasoline stations have run out of fuel, and food and medical supplies are running low. Food is so scarce that local leaders have started a makeshift flour mill.

“We feel helpless and totally defenseless,” she said. “People are afraid to leave their homes.”

The proposed European Union ban on Russian coal, part of the bloc’s effort to further penalize Russia over atrocities in Ukraine, reflected a choice of an imported energy source that would be the easiest to replace.

Deliberations over the ban and other sanctions were set to continue into Thursday, and European Union officials and diplomats anticipated that the measures would be approved. The process reflected the challenges of reaching agreement among all 27 member nations on the penalties, which would also include banning Russian ships from E.U. ports.

If approved, the sanctions would be the harshest enforced by the bloc since the invasion.

Though the European Union depends on Russian coal, the bloc could find substitute imports more easily than for natural gas and oil.

But banning coal from Russia could send energy prices soaring for European consumers, given the existing shortages in the bloc, according to Rystad Energy, a consulting firm. Carlos Torres Diaz, a senior vice president at Rystad, called the potential sanctions “a double-edged sword.”

Author of the mural Sasha Korban

Today is April 6. Russia's military attack on Ukraine has been going on for six weeks. We're reporting on all the current news.

What about today?

Key points

The Air Force Command notes that the territory of the russian horde has changed the tactics of combat operations in the air; the russians are trying not to enter the zone of the defeat of our air defense and don't come into direct contact with the fighter jets. Instead, the enemy strikes missiles from the air, in particular from the airspace of Belarus.

Given this, our air defense is working non-stop; on Tuesday, April 5, the Air Force shot down eight cruise missiles of the russian occupiers.

Already 18,600 russian occupiers have died on Ukrainian land. The other day the jubilee 150th enemy plane was shot down!

The Security Service of Ukraine has obtained secret maps and lists of russian occupiers who were destroyed by the Ukrainian army in the Donetsk region. ""The maps were registered on February 22 and contain the occupiers' plans to seize the entire territory of Donetsk region,"" the SBU said in a statement. All documents will be included in the materials of criminal proceedings as evidence of the crimes of russians and putin personally for international courts.

""We are aware that the occupiers outnumber us. That they have more equipment. But we have no other choice, the fate of our people is being decided. We know what we are fighting for. And we are doing everything to win,"" Zelenskyy said in a new video message.

The UN confirms 1,500 victims since the start of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine. In fact, there are many more who have been killed and maimed by the occupiers.

The only way to prevent the expansion of the russian war outside Ukraine is to give us the fullest support, said Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. ""Maximum sanctions. All weapons. The policy of 'not provoking putin' has failed in recent years. Help us curb this evil now or risk putin checking Article 5 (NATO article that an attack on one member of the bloc is an attack on the whole bloc) later,"" Kuleba wrote.

Deputy Head of the Office of the President, Oleh Tatarov, allowed viktor medvedchuk, andrii portnov, and portnov's son to escape. This was stated by the Center for Combating Corruption. In addition, according to the CCC, tatarov is trying to unlock the accounts of the company of putin's oligarch Deripaska frozen in Ukraine (Mykolaiv Alumina Plant). How many more traitors will we learn about?

The Verkhovna Rada registered a draft resolution recognizing russia's actions in Ukraine as genocide.

The commander of the Georgian Legion fighting for Ukraine, Mamuk Mamulashvili, has stated that his unit will not take russian soldiers captive.

Humanitarian corridors

Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said she intended to evacuate Mariupol residents by a water corridor on a Turkish ship: ""There's a preliminary agreement between Erdogan and putin about opening a sea corridor for the Turkish ship to enter the Berdiansk port and take away about 100 wounded civilians, women, children, and Turkish citizens. Turkey wants to save its citizens and help us agree on a humanitarian corridor,"" Vereshchuk explained. According to her, negotiations on this corridor continue. She added that all routes and logistics are ready, but russia is pulling back.

As of April 6, 2022, 11 humanitarian corridors have been agreed upon:

From Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia by personal transport.

From Berdyansk to Zaporizhzhia by personal transport and buses.

From Tokmak to Zaporizhzhia by personal transport and buses.

From the city of Energodar to Zaporizhzhia by personal transport.

From the city of Gulyaypole to Zaporizhzhia by personal transport. Buses from the city of Zaporizhzhia with humanitarian aid will also be sent.

From the city of Melitopol to Zaporizhzhia by personal transport. Buses from the city of Zaporizhzhia with humanitarian aid will also be sent.

From Severodonetsk to Bakhmut. Meeting place: 28 Khimikiv Avenue.

From Lysychansk to Bakhmut. Meeting place: RTI, 40 Rokiv Peremohy, 324 Sosiury Street

From Popasna to Bakhmut. Meeting place: 42 Pervomaiska Street.

From the village of Hirske to the town of Bakhmut. Meeting place: 13 Haharina Street.

From Rubizhne to Bakhmut.

Residents of the Luhansk region are asked to evacuate from the region as much as possible. There will be five ""humanitarian corridors"" for evacuation today. Meeting places:

Severodonetsk: 28 Khimikiv Avenue;

Lysychansk: RTI, 40 Rokiv Peremohy, 324 Sosiury Street

Popasna: 42 Pervomaiska Street;

Hirske: 13a Haharina Street;

Nyzhne: 13 Parova Street;

Rubizhne: 11 Chekhova Street.

Authorities are urging people from Donetsk and Luhansk regions to evacuate immediately. After the start of a new offensive by the occupiers, it will be almost impossible to do it later, Minister of Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories, Iryna Vereshchuk, emphasizes.

The Kharkiv region is subject to partial evacuation, the Ministry of Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories clarified. Authorities in Kharkiv are advising residents of Lozova and Barvinkove ​​to evacuate.

The enemy plans to focus on eastern Ukraine, as the withdrawal of occupier troops from Kyiv and Chernihiv regions was by no means a ""gesture of goodwill"" before the next round of talks, as the russian authorities are trying to convey.

23:00 – During the day, almost 5,000 people were evacuated through humanitarian corridors, more than 1,200 of them from the Luhansk region, said Minister Vereshchuk.

Who's coming to Ukraine?

About financial aid, weapons, and volunteer fighters

Estonia handed over to Ukraine a batch of D-30 howitzers, ammunition for small arms, and bulletproof vests.

And the United States will allocate an additional $100 million for the purchase of anti-tank systems for Ukraine. This was announced by Secretary of State Blinken.

Thanks to concerts in different countries around the world, people managed to raise more than 83 million euros in support of Ukraine.

And the National Health Service of Great Britain will provide Ukraine with 20 ambulances. It is noted that the cars are not new, but will be able to replace cars destroyed as a result of hostilities in Ukraine. The first batch of ambulances will arrive in Lviv this week. From there, they will be sent to regions where hostilities continue.

The European Union does not want Ukraine to lose in the war and will therefore continue to arm it. This was stated by the head of the EU diplomatic corps Josep Borrell in a new statement on russia's invasion. At the same time, the representative of European diplomacy says that the European Union should avoid a direct conflict with russia.

In addition, German Chancellor Scholz said that Germany is sending all weapons from the Bundeswehr's reserves to Ukraine, which can be delivered quickly. What exactly this weapon is not yet disclosed.

20:30 – Biden said that today he signed a new package of defense assistance to Ukraine, which includes Javelin missiles.

News from partners

Candles are lit in Stockholm in memory of those killed in Ukraine.

Yesterday, the European Union's executive body launched a new disciplinary procedure against Hungary, which could freeze Prime Minister Viktor Orban's funding for undermining liberal democratic rights. It seems that Orban rubbed the wrong way not only Ukraine with his commitment to the ""russian world.""

The United States will ban Russia from using frozen foreign currency accounts in US banks to repay sovereign debt, as was previously possible, the White House said.

Turkey returns embassy staff to Kyiv after a temporary evacuation.

Pope Francis unfurls a Ukrainian flag sent from Bucha.

In Romania, a car crashed into the gates of the russian embassy. The incident took place in Bucharest. According to local media, after the collision the car caught fire, and the driver died at the scene. It is still unknown whether this is a coincidence or a planned action.

Europe is proposing to discuss asylum for russian soldiers who refuse to fight against Ukraine; European Council President Charles Michel reported on the intention to provide protection to those who do not want to kill.

After winning the election, Hungarian Prime Minister Orban reaffirmed Hungary's intention to pay for russian gas in rubles. ""If Russia asks to pay in rubles, we will pay in rubles,"" Orban said. Apparently, he sincerely believes that putin will never ask Hungary to ""denazify.""

Anonymous said they had gained access to the Kremlin's video surveillance system. ""Now we are inside the Kremlin,"" hackers say.

In Vilnius, the lake near the Russian embassy was painted in the color of blood. This is an artistic performance to draw the world's attention to the war crimes of Russia. The red color symbolizes the blood of murdered Ukrainians. Water-based paint is not harmful to animals and plants.

And the Prime Minister of Slovenia Janez Janša published a picture of how, in his opinion, the symbol of the Russian occupiers Z was born:

russia's war against Ukraine is entering a critical phase, and NATO allies are ready to provide Kyiv with all necessary assistance to counter the possible next invasion of the invaders. This was stated by NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg before the meeting of the North Atlantic Council at the level of foreign ministers.

The United States will not participate in G20 meetings attended by Russia, said US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.

Reaction to the atrocities of the russian army in Ukraine

Israeli Foreign Minister Jair Lapid has accused russians of war crimes. This is the first sharp comment from Israeli officials regarding the genocide in Bucha.

India has condemned the killings in Ukraine's Bucha and backed calls for an independent investigation.

moscow knew and deliberately conducted a campaign of atrocities in Bucha near Kyiv. This was emphasized by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken last night before leaving for a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels. ""What we saw in Bucha is not an accidental act of a criminal unit. This is a deliberate campaign: to kill, torture, rape, commit atrocities,"" Blinken said.

Ukraine already has a list of names of non-humans involved in atrocities in the Kyiv region, said Interior Minister Denys Monastyrskyi. During reconnaissance near one of the settlements of the former Borodianka district, the Ukrainian military found the headquarters of one of the battalion tactical groups (BTG) of the horde. Among the documents found is a book of staff records, a list of personnel, combat and numerical calculation, as well as a table of call signs.

What's in Russia?

russia, through its permanent representative to the UN, Vasily Nebenzyu, has admitted that it is waging a war in Ukraine, not a ""special operation."" Nebenzya used the word ""war"" instead of ""special operation"" at the UN press conference several times and admitted that the russian army was killing civilians.

And zakharova said that russian diplomats expelled from Western countries would be employed. Will everyone be accommodated in Eritrea?

Civilian personnel of the russian army is complaining about inflation, trade unions are threatening to sue. Today, the russian military-industrial complex is beginning to experience social unrest because of a sharp decline in wages and living standards. This is a logical consequence of the astronomical costs of the war and the inability to ensure stable budget revenues because of international sanctions and economic downturns, the Defense Intelligence said.

This morning, someone tried to set fire to Solovyov's villa on Lake Como (Italy) with the help of tires; unfortunately, firefighters arrived on time and managed to extinguish everything without damaging the villa.

Another drifting mine was found in the Black Sea off the island of Kefken off the coast of Turkey.

And some good news: zhirinovsky died again. This time it's final.

In russia, peskov explained the reason for the withdrawal of troops from the Kyiv region: ""The decision to withdraw russian troops from the Kyiv region was taken 'as a sign of goodwill to create favorable conditions for negotiations.'"" They really understood the main principle well: the more territories liberated, the more successful the negotiations.

It turned out that the Mir cards were issued on European chips. National Payment Card System companies no longer sell them to the card provider. There is nothing to replace imports with yet.

russia is threatening Finland with ""retaliatory measures"" if it joins NATO. ""Finland's accession to NATO would make it a target for Russian retaliation,"" said Vladimir Dzabarov, first deputy chairman of the International Committee of the Federation Council. Earlier, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that Finland and Sweden can count on NATO membership under the accelerated procedure.

What about Belarus?

Belarus is losing its human rights: Human Rights Watch has been blocked.

Like belarus, the russian occupiers can use the territory of unrecognized Transnistria to attack Ukraine. The airfield of Tiraspol is already being prepared for the reception of aircraft. In response to such assumptions, Moldovan President Maia Sandu said that the authorities had no information about the alleged preparation of Tiraspol airport for the reception of Russian aircraft, but such a risk can not be ruled out.

In belarus, three residents of Bobruisk were detained who, according to the authorities, were trying to prevent trains with russian equipment from moving towards Ukraine.

Two Belarusian citizens were detained in Poland. They are suspected of espionage for the benefit of the belarusian secret services, according to a statement from the Polish National Prosecutor's Office. Among other things, they collected data on military and civilian facilities that are crucial for Poland's defense.

Russian lies

Belgorod residents have started poisoning pigeons because of a television lie about Ukrainian biolabs. But there's really nothing funny here: it shows the depth of the disease of the society created by television.

The organizer of the russian rally in Berlin complains: ""Well, I did not know that there was such a tragedy, we would not go. My business is now destroyed. I get calls every minute from different countries with threats. My car service page was flooded with photos of corpses…."" Another one ""who knew nothing"" and was on the ""training.""

russian foreign ministry representative zakharova sings the usual verses on zombie television. According to zakharova, foreign media also became accomplices in the crimes in Bucha. In particular, America, which became an accomplice in ""this punitive action"" and ""spreading fakes,"" is to blame again. Nothing new. All around are enemies, as always.

Meanwhile, in the foreign exchange market, the official dollar exchange rate fell below 80 rubles. Moreover, on Aliexpress, it costs 146. The usual practice of a country with an ""iron curtain"" in the anamnesis. In the USSR, the dollar also had its own fictional ""exchange rate"" of 60 kopecks.

Sanctions on the aggressor!

American developer of electrical devices and components for computers Intel suspends all business operations in Russia. Earlier, the company suspended all deliveries to customers in russia and belarus.

The UK will freeze more than 60% of Russia's foreign exchange reserves. This will block Russia's access to $305 billion. This was announced by Foreign Minister Elizabeth Truss. Details of the government's decision are expected to be released this week.

Lithuanian product manufacturer Viciunu grupe will leave the russian market.

Following the Russian warship, Google sent a rosaviatsiya (russia's Federal Air Transport Agency) website.

The russian Finance Ministry said a foreign bank had refused to execute an order to pay coupon yields on russian bonds due on April 4. In fact, Russia now faces default.

According to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, Wopke Hoekstra, the country's customs arrested 14 russian yachts because of sanctions against russia. Twelve of them are only being built at shipyards, and two are under maintenance.

The United States is imposing full blocking sanctions against russia's Sberbank and Alfa-Bank. The United States is also banning new investments in the russian economy. It has been stated that the United States is trying to deprive russia of access to dollars so that it cannot service its foreign debt. The White House has said US sanctions could be tightened or eased depending on the situation.

The United States believes that sanctions will push back the russian economy by 15 years.

The United States is also imposing sanctions on putin's daughters and lavrov's wife and daughter, the White House said. Restrictions will also affect medvedev, mishustin and members of russia's Security Council.

Britain is also imposing new sanctions on russia. Among them is a ban on imports of russian iron and steel goods; a ban on new investments in russia, ban on exports to russia of oil refining equipment. The UK has also said it will stop importing russian coal by the end of 2022.

russian businessmen are trying to circumvent anti-russian sanctions; they are transferring business and capital to Turkey, which has not joined the sanctions against russia. For example, about 1,000 companies with 100% Russian capital have recently been opened in Turkey, said Izzet Ekmekcibashi, head of the Turkish-russian Business Council.

Trophies of the Ukrainian Armed Forces

The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine has allowed the territorial defense to use artillery and missile systems. This is stated in resolution №403. Previously, the Territorial Defense was allowed to use only small arms. Now our defenders will have many more battle trophies.

These days, soldiers of 81 separate airmobile brigades destroyed the electronic warfare unit of the Armed Forces of the russian federation. The EW unit was guarded by servicemen of one of the special-purpose brigades of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the russian Armed Forces.

Life considering hostilities

The Center to Counter Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine once again calls for securing gadgets.

Ukrainians have begun receiving messages to recover accounts from phones stolen by the russian military in an attempt to restore access to looted ""trophies.""

An interactive Map of Cultural Losses has been launched in Ukraine. Anyone can join in filling it out by sending photos or video evidence of the destruction of cultural objects as a result of the war. This was reported on the website of the author of the project, the Ukrainian Cultural Foundation. According to the fund's estimates, more than 150 monuments and sites were either damaged or completely destroyed as a result of the war against Ukraine waged by the occupiers.

The National Police of Ukraine has opened a ""hotline"" for relatives of those killed in the hostilities in russia. Number 0 894 201 867. This line operates around the clock. Operators are ready to provide the necessary advice and clarification on the burial procedure.

Currently, in the settlements liberated from russian troops, police are working around the clock to search for and identify the dead civilians. The bodies of the victims of russia's military aggression are being sent for forensic examination to determine the cause of death. After conducting the necessary research, the bodies of the dead are handed over to relatives for burial.

Paralympic champion Serhii Yemelianov has put up for auction his Gold Medal from Tokyo 2020. The funds raised will go to volunteers to help the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The auction ends tomorrow. You can take part in it at this link.

Kyiv and region

There is still a high probability that the enemy will launch missile strikes on elements of Kyiv's military and civilian infrastructure. The Head of the Kyiv city military administration Mykola Zhyrnov warned about it.

During the 35 days of russian occupation in Hostomel, Kyiv region, more than 400 people went missing.

In Borodianka, the occupiers bombed high-rise buildings and forbade getting people buried alive from under the rubble,"" the mayor said.

The mayor of Bucha, Anatolii Fedoruk, said that he had witnessed the execution of several people by russians. ""I myself saw several episodes. There were three civilian cars trying to evacuate towards Kyiv and they brutally shot them. There was a pregnant woman, her husband crying and begging not to shoot her, but they took and simply brutally shot them,"" the mayor reports.

russian General Vitalii Shkolenko, who ordered the shelling of Bucha and Irpin, turned out to be Ukrainian. He is a native of the Uman district of the Cherkasy region. He used to visit relatives from Bucha and Irpin many times. For such, hell must begin in life.

In Vorzel, the occupiers hung the heads of chickens on clothespins on clotheslines… The civilized world will never understand the purpose of such actions, but only one thing is clear, in the russian hinterland, where people who now destroy all life on our earth come from psychopathy is the norm. The russian army is implementing everything that only a sick human psyche can imagine.

Also Vorzel. These are corgi paws. There is a ladder behind the house. To which russian fascist villains nailed dogs with self-tapping screws and then flayed them here. And then ate! What they didn't eat, they put in a bag to warm the pieces up. What words to describe all the atrocities of the rabid horde?

""After Bucha, Irpin, Hostomel, we thought we were ready for anything. But Borodianka. This is the most horrible thing I've ever seen,"" said Oleksiy Kuleba, head of the Kyiv Regional Office. ""Rescuers from all over Ukraine are going to dismantle the blockages in Borodianka. The occupiers wiped the village from the face of the earth,"" Kuleba said.

Donetsk and Luhansk regions

One person died in Rubizhne last night. Five more were injured. This was announced by the head of the Luhansk Regional State Administration Serhii Haidai.

In addition, 11 residential buildings were destroyed in the region. Such are the consequences of yesterday's shelling by the russian army of the residential districts of Rubizhne, Lysychansk, Popasna, Severodonetsk, and Toshkivka. ""In the old part of Severodonetsk, garages caught fire; in Rubizhne, tanks with nitric acid are burning. Preliminary, without consequences. Three floors of the residential building in Popasna burned down at once. During the russian shelling, one Rubizhne resident died. 5 locals are wounded. Seven were taken out of the rubble alive,"" the statement said.

Heavy fighting and airstrikes by russian aircraft continue in besieged Mariupol. The humanitarian situation in the city is deteriorating. More than 160,000 people have no electricity, communications, access to medicine, heat, or water.

Former mayor of Rubizhne Serhii Hortov did not just side with the russian invaders; he passed on information about people with a pro-Ukrainian position to the occupiers. This was announced by the head of the Luhansk Regional State Administration Serhii Haidai. ""Apart from joining the occupiers, the mayor is also actively cooperating with them in identifying Ukrainian activists. He is simply betraying them. He is such a traitor who betrays people with a pro-Ukrainian position to the occupiers,"" the head of the region said.

At the same time, according to Haidai, Ukraine was able to ""slightly break the plans of the occupiers, who wanted to create a picture of how the mayor hands over the keys to the occupiers, and how they are welcomed."" He submitted a petition, and the president signed a decree establishing a military-civil administration in Rubizhne. This means that ""the mayor is now nobody,"" and even the russian occupiers no longer need this traitor.

Also today, the 503rd Marine Battalion refuted the statements of the russian media about the capture of personnel in Mariupol.

After the widespread international genocide in Bucha, Russia's top leadership ordered the destruction of any evidence of crimes committed by its army in Mariupol. The russians left all the dirty work to the collaborationists. Eyewitnesses report that the russians recruited local and DPR terrorists to special brigades. They collect and burn the bodies of Mariupol residents murdered and killed as a result of the russian invasion. The work of these groups is directly coordinated by the self-proclaimed mayor-collaborator Kostiantyn Ivashchenko.

12:30 – The head of the Donetsk Regional State Administration Pavlo Kyrylenko said that orcs fired at the city of Vuhledar from jet artillery. They hit the place of humanitarian aid. According to preliminary data, two civilians were killed and five were injured.

15:40 – the russian military fired on Severodonetsk, and ten high-rise buildings caught fire. The number of injured is being clarified, said the head of the Luhansk regional military administration Gaidai.

The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

How you can help: Here are ways those in the U.S. can help support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.

Compressed tarballs and incremental patches are also available at <https://www.fsfla.org/selibre/linux-libre/download/releases/5.17-gnu/>. Freesh and RPMFreedom, the .deb and .rpm distributions of GNU Linux-libre maintained by Jason Self, already have binaries of 5.17-gnu. Thanks, Jason! We had hoped for a release during FSF's amazing LibrePlanet conference, but alas, that was not meant to be. Cleaning up scripts have required changes for the final release, compared with -rc8, and that delayed the release quite significantly. This release required updates to cleaning up logic for tegra, bnx2x, mt7915, btmtk, mscc, and new logic for dts files for various new aarch64 SoCs, and for a new driver for x86 android tablets. In other news, Jason Self has started sharing the work of preparing and verifying the multiple upstream stable releases we clean up and put out every week. Please join me in thanking him for adjusting our bus factor in a desirable way! There are likely to be upcoming changes in details about signatures as we streamline this new mode of cooperation.

Be Free! with GNU Linux-libre. What is GNU Linux-libre? ------------------------ GNU Linux-libre is a Free version of the kernel Linux (see below), suitable for use with the GNU Operating System in 100% Free GNU/Linux-libre System Distributions. http://www.gnu.org/distros/ It removes non-Free components from Linux, that are disguised as source code or distributed in separate files. It also disables run-time requests for non-Free components, shipped separately or as part of Linux, and documentation pointing to them, so as to avoid (Free-)baiting users into the trap of non-Free Software. http://www.fsfla.org/anuncio/2010-11-Linux-2.6.36-libre-debait Linux-libre started within the gNewSense GNU/Linux distribution. It was later adopted by Jeff Moe, who coined its name, and in 2008 it became a project maintained by FSF Latin America. In 2012, it became part of the GNU Project. The GNU Linux-libre project takes a minimal-changes approach to cleaning up Linux, making no effort to substitute components that need to be removed with functionally equivalent Free ones. Nevertheless, we encourage and support efforts towards doing so. http://libreplanet.org/wiki/LinuxLibre:Devices_that_require_non-free_firmware Our mascot is Freedo, a light-blue penguin that has just come out of the shower. Although we like penguins, GNU is a much greater contribution to the entire system, so its mascot deserves more promotion. See our web page for their images. http://linux-libre.fsfla.org/ If you are the author of an awesome program and want to join us in writing Free (libre) Software, please consider making it an official GNU program and become a GNU Maintainer. You can find instructions on how to do so at https://www.gnu.org/help/evaluation.
