Several posts on Instagram and Telegram show a video of eight missiles launching from a ship operating off the coast of Crimea that bear the same characteristics of a Kalibr NK SS-N-30 naval guided cruise missile, which launches vertically and then quickly pivots 90 degrees to travel parallel to the ground.

The Department of Defense was unable to confirm reports of the missile firings, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said Tuesday. However, the DoD has seen increased naval activity in the Black Sea. USNI News could not independently verify the launch.

The video lined up with ship spotters who have tracked a modern frigate operating in the Black Sea between Crimea and just off the coast of Odesa. USNI News contributor H I Sutton has tracked an Admiral Grigorovich-class frigate operating between Crimea and Odesa. It is unclear if the eight Kalibr cruise missiles were fired toward Mariupol, but given the range of the weapons, they could hit any target within a thousand miles of the launch site.

At least two videos of the Russian ships firing the Kalibr munitions were posted to Twitter Monday afternoon.

There are also indications that ships in the Sea of Azov have contributed to the Russian bombardment of the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, Kirby said, adding that he was unable to say what specific munitions were used. Moscow has continued to bombard Mariupol, which remains in Ukrainian control. The Pentagon said Monday that Russia aimed to capture the port city to create a land bridge to Crimea, which has been under Russian control since 2014.

Overall, the Russian Navy has been largely operating in a supporting role throughout the 27-day invasion and has not played a direct role in the conflict, aside from an early amphibious assault outside of Mariupol.

A senior defense official noted that the Russian Navy has 21 ships in the Black Sea as of Tuesday. Of the ships, 12 are surface combatants and nine are amphibious landing ships.

While the Russian Navy has landing ships in its fleet, an amphibious assault on Odesa is not imminent, the senior defense official said.

The increased naval activity comes as Pentagon assessments continue to highlight Russian frustration about the lack of progress.

“It is day 27, and they haven’t taken Kyiv,” Kirby said. “They haven’t taken Kharkiv. They haven’t taken Chernihiv. They haven’t been able to isolate the Donbas area. The Ukrainians are fighting back very creatively, very bravely. And that’s not by accident, either.”

The latest: The weeks-long resistance in besieged Mariupol appeared to be cracking as Russian forces moved closer to capturing the seaside port city in southeastern Ukraine, with a Russian-imposed deadline for Ukrainian forces in the city to surrender passing early Sunday local time. Meanwhile, officials in the capital Kyiv and the western city of Lviv reported explosions Saturday. Moscow has withdrawn its forces from those regions to focus on eastern Ukraine, but airstrikes have continued.

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

How you can help: Here are ways those in the U.S. can help support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.

Russia has used hypersonic missiles in its invasion of Ukraine, US President Joe Biden confirmed Monday.

""And if you'll notice, (Russia has) just launched the hypersonic missile, because it's the only thing that they can get through with absolute certainty,"" Biden said. ""It's a consequential weapon ... it's almost impossible to stop it. There's a reason they're using it.""

Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said during a news briefing on Tuesday that Russian forces used hypersonic missiles “at least in one instance,” that the US is aware of. Russian forces used the hypersonic missile “against a fixed building,” at a “relatively close range,” Kirby said.

Despite the Biden's comments, British intelligence and even the US President's own defense secretary have downplayed Russia's use of its air-launched Kinzhal missiles.

""I would not see it as a game changer,"" Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin told CBS' ""Face the Nation.""

And the UK Defense Ministry said the Kinzhal missile is really just an air-launched version of the Iskander short-range ballistic missile (SRBM), which Russia has used repeatedly in its invasion of Ukraine.

Why the fear and hype about hypersonic missiles? First, it's important to understand the term.

Essentially, all missiles are hypersonic — which means they travel at least five times the speed of sound. Almost any warhead released from a rocket miles in the atmosphere will reach this speed heading to its target. It is not a new technology.

What military powers — including Russia, China, the United States and North Korea -- are working on now is a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV). An HGV is a highly maneuverable payload that can theoretically fly at hypersonic speed while adjusting course and altitude to fly under radar detection and around missile defenses.

An HGV is the weapon that's almost impossible to stop. And Russia is thought to have an HGV in its arsenal, the Avangard system, which Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2018 called ""practically invulnerable"" to Western air defenses.

But the Kinzhal, as a variant of the Iskander SRBM, is not an HGV. While it does have limited maneuverability like the Iskander, its main advantage is that it can be launched from MiG-31 fighter jets, giving it a longer range and the ability to attack from multiple directions, according to a report last year from the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

""The MiG-31K can strike from unpredictable directions and could avoid interception attempts altogether. The flying carrier vehicle might also be more survivable than the road-mobile Iskander system,"" the report said.

The same report also noted that the ground-launched Iskander proved vulnerable to missile defense systems during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, during which Azeri forces intercepted an Armenian Iskander.

""This suggests that claims of the Kinzhal's invulnerability to missile defense systems may also be somewhat exaggerated,"" the report said.

But Ukraine's Defense Ministry says Russian forces battling toward Kyiv were able to partially take other northwest suburbs, Bucha, Hostomel and Irpin, some of which had been under attack almost since Feb. 24 when Russia began its invasion.

Russian forces are increasingly concentrating their air power and artillery on Ukraine's cities and targeting civilians, killing many and sending millions fleeing.

9:00 a.m. Russian accusations that Kyiv has biological and chemical weapons are false and illustrate that Russian President Vladimir Putin is considering using them himself in his war against Ukraine, U.S. President Joe Biden says, without citing evidence.

A 12-year-old boy who carved a wooden bowl to raffle for Ukrainians affected by the war has raised more than £200,000 for Save the Children's Ukraine appeal.

Gabriel Clark, from Cumbria, went viral last month after his father Richard issued a plea on social media for people to follow his son's woodwork Instagram account.

Within days, Gabriel's Instagram account, which shared picture's of the schoolboy's handcrafted creations, went from having six followers to 225,000.

The young boy soon decided to create one special bowl for Ukraine in an effort to raise funds for those affected by the ongoing war.

The Bowl For Ukraine appeal has now raised £215,822 and will end today when one winner will be chosen at random to win Gabriel's wooden bowl.

In a message on social media, Gabriel's father Richard wrote: ""How it ends is up to you. It's your story. Certainly we could all pat ourselves on the back for a job well done.

""Save the Children are already enormously grateful for the very real difference this money will make. But what if there was another ending?

""What if we threw caution to the wind and let go of our cynicism and really went for it?

""What if we blew this silly tale of a small boy and his bowl out of the water with a last swing shot around the moon?""",https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-news-latest-war-putin-russia-skynews-live-12541713?postid=3592899

25 Mar 2022 23.48 Sanctions 'a little late', Zelenskiy tells EU council In a video message posted to his official Facebook account, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy shared his appearance at the EU summit where he thanked European Council members for putting sanctions on Russia but said it was “a little late.” Zelenskiy said if the sanctions had been preventative, there was a chance Russia would not have gone to war. He told the council: You blocked Nord Stream 2. We are grateful to you. And rightly so. But it was also a little late. Because if it had been in time, Russia would not have created a gas crisis. At least there was a chance. The Russian military does not see what dignity is. They do not know what conscience is. They do not understand why we value our freedom so much. This is what determines how the country will live.” He said Russia has already destroyed 230 schools, 155 kindergartens and killed 128 children in Ukraine. Whole cities, villages. Just to ashes. Nothing remains. The Russian military killed journalists. Although they saw the inscription ‘Press’ on them. They may not have been taught to read. Only to kill.”

25 Mar 2022 22.03 Russian defence minister resurfaces after vanishing from public for 12 days Andrew Roth For just a few seconds on Thursday, Sergei Shoigu was back on Russians’ television screens, sitting in the corner box of a teleconference with Vladimir Putin. The Russian defence minister, arguably the man most responsible for the floundering war effort in Ukraine, had not been seen in public for 12 days. Nor had the chief of the general staff of Russia’s armed forces, Valery Gerasimov. Rumours were beginning to circulate that they may have been punished over the bungled invasion, which has failed to capture key Ukrainian cities such as Kharkiv or Kyiv and plunged Russia into economic isolation. Russians had already watched Putin browbeat and humiliate the head of the country’s foreign intelligence service, Sergei Naryshkin, during a televised meeting over the fate of the Russian-controlled territories in eastern Ukraine. Journalists have since filed reports on an investigation in the FSB directorate responsible for foreign intelligence, including on Ukraine, and on the arrest of a senior official from Russia’s national guard. It is unclear if any of those events are related to Russia’s war in Ukraine, an effort that is going according to plan, a Russian foreign ministry official said on Thursday. For many Russians, however, it is apparent that the war is not going to plan, and the expectation among Kremlin watchers is that men such as Shoigu could shoulder the blame.

While it was not possible to evacuate anyone from Melitopol, a convoy with humanitarian aid reached the city and will continue to deliver supplies on Friday. In the Kyiv region, 509 people from Velyka Dymerka, Bohdanivka and Bervytsia were evacuated to Brovary, she added. Vereshchuk said officials are continuing to work for the release of Ukrainian citizens, including border guards and civilians from Snake Island, as well as abducted local government employees. “In recent days, we have received many reports from people who managed to escape from the captivity of the occupiers about mass cases of torture of prisoners,” she alleged.

24 Mar 2022 19.17 US volunteers appear in frontline video footage Julian Borger US volunteers have surfaced in video footage from the front lines in the Ukraine, suggesting that the international legion fighting alongside the Ukrainian army is playing an increasingly active role. Two video clips appeared in Twitter on Thursday: one showing an American in combat gear posing in front of the burnt remains of what he said was a Russian tank. Off camera, a Ukrainian shouts “Welcome to America!” and the American repeats the phrase. In the other, narrated by a different soldier with an American accent, shows a detachment of soldiers taking cover by a wall alongside a road, in a village the narrator claims they have recaptured from the Russians. The first video was posted by James Vasquez, a US army veteran and building contractor from Connecticut, who according to his Twitter Feed, arrived in Poland on 15 March, crossed into Ukraine the next day, bringing with him several surveillance drones. He was sent to the front lines from Lviv on 18 March. This village has been Russian occupied for a month, they terrorized the people and took their food. Today we entered, took out 7 tanks and countless Russians thus liberating these people pic.twitter.com/0Fm3qHdepB — James Vasquez (@jmvasquez1974) March 24, 2022 “I kind of feel like I’m on an awesome very dangerous vacation,” he said. And in another tweet: “When I need to amp myself up for battle, I just think about the most punchable face on the planet… Tucker Carlson.” He gives an account of patrolling Ukraine going through numerous checkpoints and showing his passport. “They are ..shocked to see an American passport when I hit checkpoints,” he said. “They let me right through because they think it’s awesome an American soldier is here to fight alongside them.” In his account of Thursday’s battle for a village he does not name, Vasquez said he was tasked to “find a pack of Russians spotted hiding by civilians” and he used a drone to try to spot them. A few hours later, he tweeted: “Just went through six straight hours of combat. I have crazy video I’ll post later. 2 men were shot but will be ok. One fatality.”

Initial accounts of the international legion suggested that the foreign volunteers were a mixed bag, many with no experience. The military news website Task&Purpose reported there was “a swarm of Fantasists for every one candidate with experience in combat”. “Selection apparently follows no discernable process other than separating those that don’t have military experience from those that do. The former are put through a 4-week training course — the latter are given a weapon and sent to the front in ad-hoc units with a Ukrainian officer,” the report from Ukraine said.



24 Mar 2022 18.35 Ukraine uses facial recognition software to identify Russian soldiers killed in combat Johana Bhuiyan and agencies report: Ukraine is using facial recognition software to help identify the bodies of Russian soldiers killed in combat and track down their families to inform them of their deaths, Ukraine’s vice-prime minister told the Reuters news service. Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine’s vice-prime minister who also runs the ministry of digital transformation, told Reuters his country had been using software facial recognition provider Clearview AI to find the social media accounts of dead Russian soldiers. “As a courtesy to the mothers of those soldiers, we are disseminating this information over social media to at least let families know that they’ve lost their sons and to then enable them to come to collect their bodies,” Fedorov said in an interview, speaking via a translator. Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense this month began using technology from Clearview, which scrapes images on the web to match with faces featured in uploaded photos. Reuters first reported Ukraine’s use of Clearview earlier this month, but it was not clear at that time how the technology would be used.

Clearview offered its service free of charge to Ukraine after the Russian invasion and has said its search engine includes more than 2bn images from VKontakte, a popular Russian social media service. VKontakte did not respond to a request for comment. A New York based software company, Clearview AI has sparked criticism over its privacy practices from users and authorities around the world.

24 Mar 2022 17.37 EU leaders wrangle with issue of oil and gas imports from Russia at summit Jennifer Rankin European Union leaders have laid bare their differences over whether to stop buying oil and gas from Russia, following a show of transatlantic unity in a series of summits with Joe Biden and an impassioned appeal by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, for more military aid to defend his country. In the third summit on a hectic day of diplomacy that began with an emergency meeting of Nato leaders, followed by the G7, EU leaders met the US president to discuss Russia’s war against Ukraine. “The single most important thing we had to do in the west is be united,” Biden said, arriving at the EU summit, the first time a US president has attended a European Council meeting. Biden said the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, had been trying to break up Nato “from the beginning” and unity would be crucial in stopping him. “It’s the single most important thing to stop this guy, who in our country we believe has already committed war crimes,” he said. The EU leaders were due to hear a video address from Zelenskiy, four weeks since the war broke out, when he told them in a conference call that they might not see him alive again.

The European Council meeting was heavy with symbolism, but officials dampened talk of further sanctions. Poland and the Baltic states were leading the charge for tougher measures against Russia, including a ban on Russian ships and road vehicles entering the EU. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said the EU needed to “crush” Russia with sanctions over the war, which he said had turned into a “massacre”. Referring to the Soviet Union, he said Russia was trying “to re-establish the ‘empire of evil’”. Latvia’s prime minister, Arturs Krišjānis Kariņš, said energy sanctions were a “serious option” the EU should look at, starting with oil and coal. “Energy sanctions immediately are a way to stop money flowing into Putin’s coffers,” he said. “Every day that we delay sanctioning Russia’s economy, Russia maintains the ability to feed its military machine.” Read more: EU leaders wrangle with issue of oil and gas imports from Russia at summit Read more



24 Mar 2022 16.05 Ukraine says Russia has taken 400,000 civilians hostage Ukraine has accused Moscow of forcibly taking hundreds of thousands of civilians from shattered Ukrainian cities to Russia, where some may be used as “hostages” to pressure Kyiv to give up, Associated Press reports: Lyudmyla Denisova, Ukraine’s ombudsperson, said 402,000 people, including 84,000 children, have been taken against their will. The Kremlin gave nearly identical numbers for those who have been relocated, but it said they wanted to go to Russia. Ukraine’s rebel-controlled eastern regions are predominantly Russian-speaking, and many people there have supported close ties to Moscow. Kyiv and Moscow gave conflicting accounts about the people being relocated to Russia and whether they were being moved willingly or were being coerced or lied to.

Russian Col Gen Mikhail Mizintsev on Thursday said that the roughly 400,000 people evacuated to Russia since the start of the military action were from the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Moscow separatists have been fighting for control for nearly eight years. Russian authorities said they are providing accommodations and dispensing payments to the evacuees. But Donetsk Region Gov Pavlo Kyrylenko said that “people are being forcibly moved into the territory of the aggressor state”. Denisova said those removed by Russian troops included a 92-year-old woman in Mariupol who was forced to go to Taganrog in southern Russia. Ukrainian officials said that the Russians are taking people’s passports and moving them to “filtration camps” in Ukraine’s separatist-controlled east before sending them to various distant, economically depressed areas in Russia. Among those taken, Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry charged, were 6,000 residents of Mariupol, the devastated port city in the country’s east. Moscow’s troops are confiscating identity documents from an additional 15,000 people in a section of Mariupol under Russian control, the ministry said. Some could be sent as far as the Pacific island of Sakhalin, Ukrainian intelligence said, and are being offered jobs on condition they don’t leave for two years. The ministry said the Russians intend to “use them as hostages and put more political pressure on Ukraine”.



24 Mar 2022 14.59 Half of Ukraine’s children displaced by Russia’s war, UN says One month of war in Ukraine has led to the displacement of more than half of the country’s child population, the United Nations children’s agency said. Unicef said 4.3 million of an estimated 7.5 million children in Ukraine have now fled their homes, about 1.8 million of them having fled the country and 2.5 milion being internally displaced within Ukraine. The war has caused “one of the fastest large-scale displacements of children since world war two”, the Unicelf executive director, Catherine Russell, said. This is a grim milestone that could have lasting consequences for generations to come. Children’s safety, wellbeing and access to essential services are all under threat from non-stop horrific violence.

24 Mar 2022 14.42 Russia and Ukraine exchange prisoners, Kyiv says Russia and Ukraine have exchanged prisoners in the first swap of soldiers since Moscow ordered troops into Ukraine one month ago, Ukraine’s vice-prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said.

Reuters reports that in a statement posted on Facebook, Vereshchuk said: Following an order from President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the first fully fledged exchange of prisoners of war has taken place. In exchange for 10 captured occupiers, we rescued 10 of our servicemen. Eleven Russian civilian seamen rescued near the Black Sea city of Odesa were also exchanged for 19 Ukrainian civilian ship crew members held by Moscow, Vereshchuk added. Earlier this week, Russia’s foreign ministry said Moscow had completed two prisoner swaps. Russia’s human rights ombudsman, Tatiana Moskalkov, said nine Russian prisoners were exchanged for the mayor of the south-eastern city of Melitopol. Vereshchuk yesterday confirmed the Melitopol swap but denied any others had taken place.
