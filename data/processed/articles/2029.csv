Over the past few weeks, several video clips have emerged on the internet showing Turkish combat drones Bayraktar TB2 destroying Russian tanks and convoys during Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine.

Ministry of Defence, Ukraine, put up clips of the Bayraktar combat drones wreaking havoc on Russian military units and equipment, including surface-to-air missile systems, fuel convoys and supply trucks.

Ukrainian defence minister Oleksiy Reznikov said on 2 March that combat-ready Bayraktar drones had arrived in the country as part of the international military assistance Ukraine has been receiving since the start of Russia‚Äôs military operations.

According to Deutsche Welle, Ukraine has had TB2 drones since 2019, and has purchased around 50 over the past three years.

Let's take a closer look at the unmanned Bayraktar combat drones:

What is Bayraktar TB2?



The Turkish-made 6.5-metre long Bayraktar TB2 drone is around seven times lighter than its UK counterpart the Reaper drone.

The small and lightweight drones carry four laser-guided missiles, according to Baykar Technologies, the company that produces them.

With a wingspan of 12-metres, the Bayraktar can stay in the air for up to 30 hours and maintain a speed of 200 kmph. It operates at a height of 18,000 to 25,000 feet.

According to a report by Fortune, priced at around $1 million, the unmanned aerial vehicle is more expandable compared to other high-tech armaments. A Bayraktar TB2 drone has a range of about 150 kilometres.

There are about 250 such drones in action, according to the manufacturer.

The drones have seen in action in conflicts near Turkey, Libya, and Syria. Most recently it made headlines when Azerbaijan and Armenia had a face off in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war.

Azerbaijan managed to destroy advancing Armenian tanks and artillery thanks to the TB2s.

Bayraktar: Ukraine‚Äôs advantage over Russia



Advances in drone warfare over the past few years have put conventional forces at a disadvantage. This, as most ground-to-air defence systems are designed to protect against threats like combat jets.

According to a report by Time, Russia‚Äôs advance has been slowed due to Ukraine‚Äôs drone campaign and is revealing weaknesses on the part of the Russian Army.

The surprising failure of Russia to dominate the skies over Ukraine has helped drones to utilise the airspace to their advantage, even though they are still vulnerable to attacks by fighter jets, helicopters and surface-to-air missiles.

Videos of drone strikes shared on social media by Ukrainian forces and ministers are also playing an important role in Ukraine‚Äôs information war. On one hand, the videos, often carrying mocking messages in Russian or English, instil fear in the enemy, they provide a vital boost to the morale of the Ukrainian forces.

The black-and-white video, which was shared to the Ukrainian Armed Forces‚Äô twitter account, is one of many that have surfaced on social media in recent days.

According to a report by Al Jazzera, which quotes Mauro Gilli, senior researcher in military technology and international security at ETH Zurich, to properly utilise drones like the TB2 it‚Äôs best to be employed along with electronic systems that can blind enemy radars.

‚ÄúDrones like the TB2 are vulnerable to anti-air defence systems. To be effective, they need to be employed in a savvy way, in coordination with other electronic warfare systems that ‚Äòblind‚Äô enemy radars and through appropriate tactics,‚Äù Gilli said.

‚ÄúHowever, against capable enemies, these technologies and tactics might not be sufficient. In Libya, Russian forces figured out effective ways to counter Turkish tactics and shoot down their drones. The same [has been] observed in Syria and Nagorno-Karabakh,‚Äù he added.

It is also possible, he added, that the Bayraktar‚Äôs success could also suggest that Russian forces are advancing without air defence, or that Ukraine has acquired advanced electronic warfare systems.

‚ÄúWhether they will have a systematic effect on the outcome of the war, it‚Äôs hard to say, but I tend to be sceptical,‚Äù said Gilli.

Russia has launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In a pre-dawn televised address on 24 February, Russia‚Äôs President Vladimir Putin ordered a ‚Äúspecial military operation‚Äù in the country.

advertisement

Putin claimed during his address that the operation was in response to threats from Ukraine. He claimed that Russia had been made to feel they could not be ‚Äúsafe, develop and exist,‚Äù the BBC reports.

advertisement

In his speech, Putin also issued a stark warning against interfering to other countries. https://twitter.com/ASB_Breaking/status/1496796666728521731? He said that any attempts to interfere on the operation will lead to ‚Äúconsequences they have never seen.‚Äù

Shortly after Putin‚Äôs early morning televised address, explosions were reportedly heard in several of Ukraines major cities such as Kharkiv, Kramatorsk, Mariupol, as well as the capital Kyiv. Airports and military bases are said to have been the first to be hit as troops entered into Ukraine.

advertisement

Following Putin‚Äôs televised address, many Ukrainian citizens prepared to flee and queues began to form at gas stations, pharmacies, banks, and grocery stores. While others made preparations to fight back against the invasion.

advertisement

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky urged citizens to stay at home as martial law was introduced. In a post on Twitter, Zelensky wrote: ‚ÄúRussia treacherously attacked our state in the morning, as Nazi Germany did in #2WW years. As of today, our countries are on different sides of world history. has embarked on a path of evil, but is defending itself & won‚Äôt give up its freedom no matter what Moscow thinks.‚Äù

advertisement

From the start of the invasion, Zelenskyy, who has received praise from around the world, said that he is ‚Äúgoing to defend our nation.‚Äù Zelenskyy has stayed in Ukraine to fight against the invasion despite receiving threats to his life.

advertisement

Many neighboring countries have opened their borders to fleeing Ukrainian citizens. The likes of Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary and Moldova have opened their borders.

advertisement

The BBC reports that the UN said on February 28th that more than 500,000 Ukrainians had entered neighboring countries. It comes as the likes of Poland has opened its borders to fleeing Ukrainian citizens, even to those without valid passports, according to i News.

advertisement

Some of those fleeing the country are said to have had to wait for days to cross at some border points. It is due to extreme queues forming.

Countries around the world, including the U.S, UK, European Union, and Asian nations, have placed sanctions on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. Even Switzerland, a country that has historically remained neutral in global wars, announced its support for Ukraine.

advertisement

According to Bloomberg, the sanction implemented by the US bans transactions with the Russian central bank, the Russian National Wealth Fund, and the Ministry of Finance. While the Prime Minister of the UK, Boris Johnson, announced an asset freeze against all major Russian banks and sanctions on more than 100 individuals, entities and their subsidiaries.

As airstrikes and fighting on the ground remain, tensions have continued to rise. On February 27th, days into the invasion, Putin told Russia‚Äôs military to put its deterrence forces on ‚Äúspecial alert,‚Äù the BBC reports.

advertisement

The deterrence force includes nuclear weapons, however, it does not mean that the country intends to use them. According to the outlet, Putin said the change was because of ‚Äúaggressive statements‚Äù by the West.

advertisement

Not only has Russia placed its deterrence forces on ‚Äúspecial alert,‚Äù it has also been accused of using cluster munitions. According to LADbible, Russia has been accused of using cluster munitions in an attack on a Ukrainian hospital and at a preschool.

advertisement

The outlet reports that cluster munitions are banned in most countries. This is because when they explode, they scatter explosives which often do not detonate on impact and could then act as landmines.

advertisement

Agn√®s Callamard, Amnesty International secretary-general, said in a statement that there was ‚Äúno possible justification for dropping cluster munitions in populated areas, let alone near a school.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis attack bears all the hallmarks of Russia‚Äôs use of this inherently indiscriminate and internationally-banned weapon, and shows flagrant disregard for civilian life.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kind of a parcel mama can you send me,‚Äù he responds. ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about? What happened?‚Äù his mum says.



He answers: ‚ÄúMama, I‚Äôm in Ukraine. There is a real war raging here. I‚Äôm afraid. We are bombing all of the cities together, even targeting civilians.

The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine released a video in which Ukrainian drones hit the Russian electronic warfare system [EW] and self-propelled, medium-range surface-to-air missile systems 9K317 Buk-M2 TELAR. According to the Ukrainian military, the two systems were struck near Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine.

Ukrainian sources confirmed to BulgarianMilitary.com that in recent weeks Bayraktar TB2 drones have targeted and destroyed Russian command posts, armored combat vehicles, Russian infantry vehicles, and various mobile air defense systems.

According to unconfirmed information, since 2019, Ukraine has acquired about 50 strike drones from Bayraktar TB2. BulgariaMilitary.com announced last week that Ukraine and Turkey have agreed on a new supply of efficient drones.

The first registered flight of the Turkish attacking drone was in 2014. Since then, Bayraktar TB2 has gained great popularity around the world after taking an active part in countering Russian weapons systems in Libya, Syria, and the Nagorno-Karabakh war.

During the civil conflict in Libya in 2019-2020, Bayraktar TB2 took an active part in the fighting against the Libyan National Army [LNA] led by Field Marshal Khalifa Belqasim Haftar. One of the most successful airstrikes on Turkish drones was the destruction of two LNA Ilyushin Il-76TD cargo planes on the ground at al-Jufra Airbase.

Following are reports from sources of the destruction of Russia‚Äôs Paintsir-S1 mobile air defense systems, both in Libya and in Syria and Nagorno-Karabakh. According to various reports, more than 73 Syrian military vehicles were destroyed in early 2020, and a total of 19 soldiers were killed by Turkish drones.

During the 2020 war in Nagorno-Karabakh between Azerbaijan and Armenia, Turkish drones destroyed dozens of Armenian infantry positions and military vehicles, including BM-30 Smerch MLRS, T-72s tanks, BMP-1, and BMP-2 IFVs. Bayraktar TB2 has reportedly successfully destroyed nine Osa and Strela-10 air defense systems in the same conflict.

However, Bayraktar TB2 also suffered defeats. During the Libyan civil war alone, various reports indicate that 47 Bayraktar TB2 drones were shot down by LNA forces. The same statement was made by the American correspondent Jeff Jaworski. There are reports of at least two Turkish Bayrakt TB2 drones shot down by Armenian troops in the Nagorno-Karabakh war, and about a dozen Syrian army drones shot down in the skies over Syria.

Bayraktar TB2

Bayraktar TB2 is a medium-altitude long-endurance [MALE] unmanned combat aerial vehicle [UCAV] manufactured by the Turkish Company Baykar. The drone has an autonomous mode of operation and is controlled by operators remotely.

More than 300 Bayraktar TB2 units are currently operating worldwide. The operators of these attacking drones are Turkey, Azerbaijan, Ethiopia, Kyrgyzstan, Libya, Morocco, Pakistan, Poland, Qatar, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine. Reports indicate that Bulgaria, Albania, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Oman, Rwanda, Somalia, and Serbia are interested in Turkish drones. According to the latest information, Iraq and Niger have placed an order for the purchase of a total of 14 Bayraktar TB2 drones [Iraq-8, Niger-6].

The operating range of Bayraktar TB2 is 150 km, which is achieved with a cruise speed of 130 km / h. The maximum speed at which the Turkish drone can fly is 220 km / h. The maximum altitude at which it can fly is 8.2 km, and the recommended working altitude is 5.5 km.

Bayraktar TB2 is powered by a 100 hp [75 kW] internal combustion engine with injection, which burns a maximum of 300 liters [79 US gal] of gasoline. It is 6.5 meters long and 12 meters wide with a full wingspan. It can carry a payload of 150 kg over its own weight.

Bayraktar TB2 has interchangeable EO / IR / LD imaging and targeting sensor systems or Multi-Mode AESA Radar, as Aselsan CATS EO / IR / LD imaging and targeting sensor [current production] and WESCAM MX-15D EO / IR / LD imaging and targeting sensor.

The armament of Bayraktar TB2 consists of four laser-guided smart ammunition. They may be different, but according to official information, the quake drone has a choice of what ammunition to use among L-UMTAS [Long Range Anti-tank Missile System], MAM-C and MAM-L precision-guided ammunition, Roketsan Cirit [70 mm Missile System], TUBITAK-SAGE BOZOK Laser-Guided Rockets, TUBITAK-SAGE TOGAN air-to-surface launched 81 mm mortar ammunition, TUBITAK-SAGE KUZGUN Modular joint ammunition.

A Russian Zala Aero KUB kamikaze drone has been shot down by Ukranian forces in the Podilskyi district of Kyiv, according to Ukranian defence industry news website Mil.in.ua https://mil.in.ua/en/news/ukrainian-army-downed-russian-orlan-10-uav/.

The KYB-UAV is a ‚Äúloitering‚Äù drone which can be equipped with a variety of weapon payloads (ball bearings surrounding an explosive charge in the case of the unit shot down in Kyiv, according to the website). It has an endurance of 30 minutes and a flight speed of up to 120km/hr.

This is the first time this type of Russian strike drone has been reported to be in use in Ukraine and marks a probable escalation in drone use.

According to Belgian defence analyst Tim De Zitter, writing in a Linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/update-russian-drone-operations-we-have-seen-18-days-war-de-zitter/) post :‚ÄúIn the earliest phase of the conflict it seemed as if the Russian advance lacked ISR/combat UAVs that should have been part of their regular CONOPS/TTPs as defined by training, exercises, and military deployments to Syria and Nagorno-Karabakh‚Ä¶.As the Russian military adjusted its operations, tightened supply and logistics, and continued the advance from Crimea, Donbass and south to Kyiv and Kharkiv, more evidence emerged of Russian drones in ISR and target acquisition capacity. On Mar 9 Russia‚Äôs Izvestia released footage from a ZALA-421-16E5G UAV showing Russian artillery strikes on Ukrainian positions in Mariupol. Downed Orlan-10s, captured Eleron-3s and Eniks target UAVs evidence that the Russian military is returning to its concept of operations where UAVs scout the area, report adversary movements and positions, and provide coordinates for artillery, MLRS and airborne assets.‚Äù

The Orlan-10 UAV, with a range of up to 120 km, makes up the largest share of the Russian drone fleet. Mil.in.ua reports that this drone has been in operational use in the Donbass region for some months; Ukranian forces have successfully intercepted a number of Orlan-10s as a result of jamming by Ukrainian Trytel Nota electronic counter measure systems, says the website.

According to Tim de Zitter other UAVs, such as Zastava, Eleron-3, Takhion, Granat, and ZALA, currently in service, provide ISR coverage at the tactical level, with a range between 12 and 100 km, giving Russian forces extended coverage of the battlefield. Meanwhile, Russia also has combat UAVs (CUAVs) in its arsenal ‚Äì most notably the Orion/Forpost-R UCAV, a medium altitude long endurance UAS which is a licensed produced version of the Israel Aerospace Industries Searcher UAV, with combat capability recently demonstrated during Zapad-2021 drills with Belarus.
