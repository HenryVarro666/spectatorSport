The Russian army behaves the same way today,” Duda denounced during a press conference in Sofia with his Bulgarian counterpart, Rumen Radev. The Polish president accused the “Russian leaders” of behaving like “Hitler and the SS (Nazi paramilitary group) and the other World War II fascists”, and trusted that those responsible for these “war crimes” will be held accountable to international justice. “These are unprecedented murders that the free world will never accept,” added Duda, Duda praised the heroism of Ukrainian resistance in the face of Russia's “brutal invasion” and assured that the country needs help to defeat the “imperialist desire” of Russian President Vladimir Putin. That is why he trusted that at the NATO summit on the 24th he will clearly defend the freedom and sovereignty of Ukraine. Duda and Radev discussed the need to free their countries from Russia's “energy blackmail”. In this regard, the Bulgarian president referred to the need to build pipelines connecting southern Europe, from Greece, with the Baltic countries through Romania and Bulgaria.",https://www.infobae.com/en/2022/03/22/poland-says-the-russian-army-behaves-in-ukraine-like-the-nazis-2/
