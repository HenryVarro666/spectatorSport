The social media company is also temporarily allowing some posts that call for death to Russian President Vladimir Putin or Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, according to internal emails to its content moderators.

""As a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine we have temporarily made allowances for forms of political expression that would normally violate our rules like violent speech such as 'death to the Russian invaders.' We still won't allow credible calls for violence against Russian civilians,"" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement.

The calls for the leaders' deaths will be allowed unless they contain other targets or have two indicators of credibility, such as the location or method, one email said, in a recent change to the company's rules on violence and incitement.

Citing the Reuters story, Russia's embassy in the United States demanded that Washington stop the ""extremist activities"" of Meta. read more

""Users of Facebook & Instagram did not give the owners of these platforms the right to determine the criteria of truth and pit nations against each other,"" the embassy said on Twitter in a message that was also shared by their India office.

The temporary policy changes on calls for violence to Russian soldiers apply to Armenia, Azerbaijan, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, and Ukraine, according to one email.

In the email recently sent to moderators, Meta highlighted a change in its hate speech policy pertaining both to Russian soldiers and to Russians in the context of the invasion.

""We are issuing a spirit-of-the-policy allowance to allow T1 violent speech that would otherwise be removed under the Hate Speech policy when: (a) targeting Russian soldiers, EXCEPT prisoners of war, or (b) targeting Russians where it's clear that the context is the Russian invasion of Ukraine (e.g., content mentions the invasion, self-defense, etc.),"" it said in the email.

""We are doing this because we have observed that in this specific context, 'Russian soldiers' is being used as a proxy for the Russian military. The Hate Speech policy continues to prohibit attacks on Russians,"" the email stated.

Last week, Russia said it was banning Facebook in the country in response to what it said were restrictions of access to Russian media on the platform. Moscow has cracked down on tech companies, including Twitter (TWTR.N), which said it is restricted in the country, during its invasion of Ukraine, which it calls a ""special operation.""

Many major social media platforms have announced new content restrictions around the conflict, including blocking Russian state media RT and Sputnik in the European Union, and have demonstrated carve-outs in some of their policies during the war.

Emails also showed that Meta would allow praise of the right-wing Azov battalion, which is normally prohibited, in a change first reported by The Intercept.

The Meta spokesperson previously said the company was ""for the time being, making a narrow exception for praise of the Azov Regiment strictly in the context of defending Ukraine, or in their role as part of the Ukraine National Guard.""

The International Criminal Court (ICC) has opened an investigation into the war in Ukraine after a request from 39 member states, including Switzerland. Other courts are also looking at Ukraine’s complaints after the Russian invasion. We look at the chances of Russia and its leaders being held to account.

The ICC is the only international court that could potentially hold individuals including Vladimir Putin criminally responsible. But Ukraine has also brought cases against the Russian state at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). Sergey Vasiliev, a Russian-Dutch international criminal law expert at the University of Amsterdam, thinks Ukraine has been remarkably quick and impressive in its “lawfare” following the Russian invasion, especially given the circumstances. “This was probably done by international lawyers in Ukraine working in bunkers, with help from the diaspora,” he told SWI swissinfo.ch.

The question is how quick and effective these steps might be. First of all, these court proceedings take time. Already on Monday, the ICJ heard the case of UkraineExternal link, which argues that Russia has wilfully misused and violated the UN’s 1948 Genocide Convention. Kyiv says Russia falsely accused Ukraine of genocide against Russian speakers in the separatist Donbass region as a pretext for its invasion. The ICJ was then due to hear the Russian response on Tuesday, but Russia did not show up. And while a final ruling could take years, Cecily Rose, an expert on the ICJ at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands, thinks the court could issue a decision within the next week or two with “provisional measures”, essentially ordering Russia to stop its invasion.

Would Russia take any notice? Marco Sassoli, a professor of international law at the University of Geneva, is doubtful. “It seems Russia no longer cares about international law,” he says. But Sassoli thinks it is still important for history because “revisionists might later say Putin was right”. Rose is also pessimistic about such an order stopping the Russian military machine immediately, but she thinks it could perhaps play into ceasefire and peace negotiations.

The ECHRExternal link has already issued provisional measures calling on Russia to “refrain from military attacks against civilians and civilian objects” as well as other violations of international humanitarian law.

Which courts do what The International Court of Justice (ICJ) Based in The Hague, Netherlands, it is the UN’s highest court and rules on disputes between states, based on international treaties and conventions. It cannot prosecute individuals. Its rulings are binding but it has no enforcement mechanism. The International Criminal Court (ICC) Also based in The Hague, the ICC was created in 2002 under the Statute of Rome. It is not a UN court but has many UN countries as members, although not the US, China, Russia or Ukraine. Ukraine nevertheless recognised its jurisdiction following the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014. The ICC can, under certain circumstances, prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide committed anywhere in the world. In 2017 it also introduced the “crime of aggression” but can only prosecute this under restrictive conditions. It can issue international arrest warrants for individuals, but relies on member states to arrest them. It does not have its own police force. European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) Based in Strasbourg, France, it is not to be confused with the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg. The ECHR was set up in 1959. It rules on individual or state applications alleging violations of the European Convention on Human Rights, which Russia and Ukraine have both ratified. The Court’s decisions are binding, but again it has no enforcement mechanism. End of insertion

ICC opens investigation

Neither Russia nor Ukraine are members of the International Criminal Court, but Ukraine accepted its jurisdiction after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. The court can prosecute individuals for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. In 2017, the ICC also introduced the crime of aggression, but under restrictive conditions. It can only prosecute this crime if both concerned states are members, which they are not in this case, or if there is a referral from the UN Security Council, where Russia has a veto. The ICC could therefore only prosecute for the other crimes in this case.

Putin is clearly guilty of aggression, says Sassoli, but war crimes are much harder to prove, as you have to show a direct link between the individual and the deliberate targeting of civilians. In this war it could also be complicated by the fact that Ukraine has encouraged civilians to make home-made explosives. And if they throw them at Russian soldiers, they will be legitimate targets of attack under international humanitarian law (IHL), Sassoli told swissinfo.ch. Ukraine also violates IHL by parading captured Russian prisonersExternal link of war on social media.

Nevertheless, there have been reports of Russia targeting residential buildings, using banned weapons and staging attacks around nuclear facilities, potentially causing an even bigger catastrophe. There have also been allegations of rape by Russian soldiers. And Ukrainian refugees (two million and rising) will no doubt have their own stories to tell, including to the courts.

The ICC has so far moved at a “glacial pace” on Ukraine, according to Vasiliev. It opened a “preliminary examination” in 2014 but has not made it a priority until now. However, announcing the launch of an investigationExternal link on February 28, ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan said he was satisfied that there was already “a reasonable basis to believe that both alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity have been committed in Ukraine” and that the investigation would now be expanded to all areas of the country. He appealed for more resources, saying that “the importance and urgency of our mission is too serious to be held hostage to lack of means”.

According to Vasiliev, the ICC already has investigators in the region, although it is not clear if they are in neighbouring countries like Poland, where refugees are arriving, or in Ukraine itself. Sassoli says this could be a chance for the ICC to boost its credibility, but that it must also be careful. If it goes fast on Ukraine but continues to drag its heels on Gaza, Afghanistan or Georgia, for example, it will be accused of coming under pressure from Western powers.

Could Putin be arrested?

Asked if the ICC might dare issue an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin, Sassoli says it has been quite courageous in the past: for example, its Afghanistan probeExternal link includes crimes allegedly committed by US and allied forces in that country. But he thinks it more likely that the war crimes easiest to prove could be those of “poor Russian recruits” who, we understand, were told by Russian propaganda that they were coming to liberate Ukraine from genocide.

Vasiliev thinks there might one day be an ICC arrest warrant for Putin, possibly issued under wraps for fear of exacerbating the situation on the ground. But then there is another problem, he told swissinfo.ch. As a sitting head of state whose country is not a member of the ICC, Putin has diplomatic immunity from arrest and prosecution, so the ICC could not issue a request to member states to arrest him. The ICC has no police force and relies on member states to carry out arrests.

So if Putin were to return to Geneva for peace talks, he would probably not be arrested. Vasiliev thinks it unlikely that Putin could be detained until he leaves or is forced from office.

Universal jurisdiction and commissions of inquiry

Putin and his entourage might however be careful where they travel due to the principle of “universal jurisdiction”. States (including Switzerland) who have incorporated this principle into their legislation can arrest suspected perpetrators of international crimes (genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes) on their territory and try them in domestic courts. The Netherlands has also incorporated the crime of aggression under this principle.

Russian oligarchs might also not feel safe travelling to certain countries, sending their kids to Swiss schools or coming skiing here, says Sassoli – for fear of one day being arrested. It remains to be seen what happens, but this all puts more pressure on the Russian president.

Meanwhile, the UN Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva last week voted to set up a three-member commission of inquiry into violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in Ukraine. Its mandate is to investigate, identify “individuals and entities” responsible, and preserve evidence “for future legal proceedings”. The Human Rights Council is not a court but could help feed into legal processes. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is also investigating.

Given especially that the ICC’s resources and mandate never allow it to take on more than a few top cases, Vasiliev thinks concerted action is now needed. “Accountability actors should join efforts aimed at collecting and processing evidence of core crimes in Ukraine,” he wrote in a recent blogExternal link. “The cogs of justice grind slowly but they have already been set in motion. This is no consolation but a call to action.”

3,5ddb9090-19cf-41e1-b832-2268cb316e5e,['Vivienne Walt'],,"Exhausted and choked with emotion, a group of captured Russian soldiers told journalists in Kyiv on Monday that their government had betrayed them by sending them to fight a war under false pretenses. “I feel shame that we came to this country,” Lieutenant Colonel Astakhov Dmitry Mikhailovich said on camera. “We will go to jail or whatever we deserve.” Hours later, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky bluntly stated what he thought they deserved. “All people who came to our land, all people who gave those orders, all soldiers who were shooting—they are all war criminals,” he told ABC News.

But experts say that proving Zelensky’s claim, and convicting people of war crimes—from frontline soldiers to President Vladimir Putin—will likely take years, with an uncertain outcome, despite the horrific violence. For indictments to stick in court, hard evidence will be needed— and not the kind of photo and video evidence that you might expect. The most important place to look is actually in soldiers’ pockets, says Bill Wiley, founder and executive director of the Commission for International Justice and Accountability, who has investigated conflicts for 25 years, in the Balkans, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and elsewhere. The “pocket debris,” as he calls it, includes cellphones and computers, written instructions from commanders, and battlefield maps.

These are all crucial in proving the pivotal issue in any war-crimes indictment: intent. While international laws of war forbid targeting civilians or civilian property, it also allows for innocent people being killed by accident in the crossfire, which would indemnify Russian soldiers and their commanders.

What is more, he says, there is no time to waste in collecting and safeguarding evidence from potential tampering, while Ukraine’s borders remain open and Russia does not control the country.

“The key is to get started now,” he says. “It is much easier to establish now, than when the net closes in more and more in Ukraine.”

The wrong way to prove responsibility

From the start, Ukrainians have been keenly aware of the need to gather evidence for possible war-crimes charges. Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted the day after Russia invaded that the government was collecting details of Russian strikes, including on a kindergarten and an orphanage, to “immediately send to the Hague,” referring to the International Criminal Court, or ICC, which is located in the Dutch capital. “Responsibility is inevitable,” he wrote. And in fact, the ICC opened a war-crimes investigation on February 28.

Yet while Kuleba was talking as a politician fighting for his country’s survival, that “responsibility” might not be provable in court. “There is some pretty nasty-looking stuff which I suspect amounts to a crime, but we don’t know for certain,” Wiley says. “It is painfully difficult building cases like this.”

In the days since Russia invaded on February 24, Wiley, who has sat glued to the coverage, says he has watched regular Ukrainians make the same mistake as Syrians did during 10 years of war: Shooting hours of cellphone video, of bombed-out schools, houses, and apartment buildings—in the belief that they surely offer proof of war crimes. Ukraine’s government has also deployed teams to capture footage, in part to create a historical record of the war, as well as to gather trial evidence. “This is more about making a record of Russia’s crimes,” military videographer Serhiy Lysenko told the Washington Post, while filming the remnants of a bombed house south of Kyiv, where six people were killed. “We do believe in The Hague.”

But such footage is almost useless in a trial, according to Wiley. “At the end of the day, it is 99.9% of no use or relevance to a criminal case.”

Uncovering intent

A treasure trove of “pocket debris” could well be lying on the dead bodies of soldiers left on the battlefield, or in the uniforms of captured soldiers like Mikhailovich. The U.S. estimated on Tuesday that between 2,000 and 4,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in two weeks of war. Each might have carried valuable evidence, on the hard drives of their phones and computers, or in written notes or maps, all of which could be used to piece together the central question in a war-crimes case: Who ordered what crime.

From his years investigating the Syria war, including the terror campaign by the Islamic State, or ISIS, Wiley is certain that Russian officers in Ukraine carry critical items, including code books or equipment to decrypt coded messages. And lower-ranking Russian soldiers likely have a gold mine of information on their cellphones; the phones themselves offer precise tracking of their movements, and many would likely have shot photos and videos. ISIS appeared far more tech-savvy than the Russians, he says, “but even the thickest soldier has all manner of photos on his phone, giving us a sense of who else was and is in the same unit.”

Capturing that information, as well as intercepts, might already be underway. “The Ukrainians assuredly have directions from above to be collecting this stuff and passing it to intelligence analysis cells,” says Wiley, who once served as an infantry captain in the Canadian military. But he believes they might not be aware of how crucial the material is for a future war-crimes trial.

Based on his experience investigating the Syrian war—where Russia’s military provided essential firepower for the regime—Wiley believes Ukraine ought to be able to intercept Russia’s communications. “Russian communications, a lot of it, is not encrypted. It is pretty surprising,” he says. “On the battlefield a lot of the kit is very old.”

It is possible that communication is already being captured. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told CNN on Sunday that they had seen “very credible reports” of war crimes, and they were gathering all the details. “We are documenting everything,” he said. Wiley’s organization CIJA, launched in 2012, is funded by the U.S., U.K., Canadian and European governments, and he says he has already advised donors it would cost the group about €5 million a year to investigate the Ukraine war.

Similar to cellphone footage, Wiley says that there is also limited use in a trial for the testimony from refugees who have fled the war zones, and who human-rights organizations are debriefing across Ukraine’s borders. Those heartbreaking stories will not likely bolster the prosecution’s case in a war-crimes trial. Collecting the information, says Wiley “is a very, very small portion and fairly easy to do,” he says.

The bulk of the work will be piecing together a chain of command from the crime to the original order, in theory all the way to Putin. Given the Russian president’s overwhelming grip on the war, that chain might be far easier to trace than in other wars, according to some experts. “Very little is going to happen in this theater on the Russian side that would not be traceable right up the chain of command, to the top of the Russian state,” Stephen Rapp, who was the U.S. war-crimes envoy between 2009 and 2015, told Politico last week.

Still, it will require careful documentation to win a case in the Hague.

Protecting the evidence

Even while rockets pound cities and millions flee, physical evidence will need to be meticulously logged, and then safeguarded against tampering. Digital evidence will also need to be kept in a central, secure place. Wiley says Ukraine should immediately digitize all paper records they have found, and create several electronic, encrypted back-up systems, in case Kyiv falls to Russian control; he admits that “in the current circumstances, this will be difficult.”

In fact, even gathering the evidence could be complex and exceedingly dangerous, as Wiley’s organization learned in Syria. CIJA helped smuggle out of Syria about 1.3 million pages of documents over several years. The mountain of details helped it piece together the command structure of the war, by finding the initial orders—essential in identifying war criminals. There are also about 50,000 pages of ISIS documents, collected in the military campaign against the jihadists, along with dozens of seized cellphones and computers. “The key is to be able to find the captured originals,” Wiley says. “We need the primary sources.”

That entire archive is now in CIJA’s secure vault, in a secret location in Europe, and there are multiple back-up hard drives of the material. The documents have become a key source of evidence for about 15 countries’ law-enforcement authorities in criminal prosecutions, for example against members of ISIS, according to Wiley.

Ukrainian officials might seek to conceal what they have found, for fear of revealing to Russia what they know. But Wiley suggests Ukraine’s government should nonetheless immediately set up a secure storage system for evidence. Wiley fears that otherwise, evidence might be lost if Kyiv falls to Russian forces. “Even if they are collecting it, where is it going? Ukrainians are fighting for their lives,” he says.

Such is the gravity of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s aggression against Ukraine that an international prosecutor should be appointed and a tribunal established to bring him and his collaborators to trial for their crimes. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and his foreign minister pleaded with the world this week for action based on the principles that guided the Allied countries in 1942 when they gathered in London to promulgate a decree entitled, “Punishment for War Crimes.” Just as the World War II Allies vowed 80 years ago to indict Nazi war criminals, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba is asking that Putin be brought to justice for the same kind of “crimes against peace.”

With his armies surrounding Ukraine’s major cities and firing indiscriminately on inhabitants, the catalogue of Putin’s atrocities grows: the killing of civilians, including children; repeated breaches of ceasefires and humanitarian corridors; nuclear brinkmanship; and threatening the public execution of civilians who do not bend to his diktats.

Yet a gap in international law prevents the International Criminal Court (ICC) from investigating and prosecuting Russia for the most basic war crime of all: aggression, even though aggression is recognized as a crime in many countries’ own national laws (including those of Russia and Ukraine).

The ICC has powers to investigate crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide; but Russia never signed on to an amendment establishing aggression as a crime and therefore isn’t bound by it. And that stymies the international community’s fastest and simplest path to holding Putin accountable for waging an illegal war.

So while the United Nations General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to recognize that the Ukraine invasion lacks any legal justification and that it constitutes the international offense of aggression in violation of the UN Charter, there is no obvious legal route to charge Putin for that overarching offense. The European Court of Human Rights can investigate violations of civil liberties, and the UN’s International Court of Justice can examine Ukraine’s complaint against Russia, but the aggressor can’t be arraigned as was done when setting up the international military tribunals that eventually led to the Nuremberg trials.

In the spirit of the 1942 agreement, I and more than 100 former and current European leaders and international lawyers are urging the U.S. to join us in supporting a special tribunal to try Putin for his crimes of aggression. There is an American precedent that might encourage President Joe Biden to seize the moment. In 1993 and 1994, President Bill Clinton pushed for and succeeded in establishing special tribunals for dealing with war crimes in Yugoslavia and Rwanda.

Pressing for such a tribunal is, as the Ukrainians have told us, important to boosting the morale of a beleaguered but resilient people. Though lives are being destroyed, Ukrainian unity seems indestructible. Hearts may be broken every hour of the day but their resolve has proved unbreakable. Buildings are being razed to the ground but the spirit of the people is lifting up the world. We, in turn, must lift them up, not just in word but in deed.

A tribunal would also send a message to Putin and his inner circle that their brutal criminality will not escape trial and punishment. It would sow fear among Putin’s inner circle, if not Putin himself. Just as those complicit with Nazi crimes started to peel away from their leader and seek private deals, so, too, may Putin’s collaborators begin to cooperate with the forces of justice.

The way forward is for a group of governments to support Ukraine in setting up such a tribunal. As a first step, we must record the crimes of continued aggression as they happen. An office should be staffed in the Hague (home to the ICC) to collect evidence and investigate how best to proceed with organizing this route to justice. A small staff should work closely with the ICC and, given that the crime of aggression is already well understood, move with speed. By summer a tribunal could be in place and Putin indicted.

“Grand strategy looks beyond the war to the subsequent peace,” wrote the historian Basil Liddell Hart. So even as Ukraine is ravaged by bombs and bullets, it is right to think now of what comes after and how best to achieve reconciliation, peace and justice for Ukrainians.

Not since 1942 have the words issued in the decree of the Allies been more apposite. Our aim must be, they said, “to secure the punishment, through the channel of organized justice, of those guilty or responsible” and “to satisfy the sense of justice of the civilized world.”

Against this ominous backdrop, Russia's war of aggression in Ukraine represents a new low – one that cannot be tolerated if there is to be peace in the twenty-first century.

OXFORD – The international rule of law – the simple idea that relations between states should be governed by enforceable constraints – has come under increasing strain in recent years. Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, a clear violation of both the United Nations Charter and customary international law, is perhaps the clearest example of just how precarious the situation has become.

But Russian President Vladimir Putin and his authoritarian peers are hardly the only ones who have been systematically undermining the international rule of law. The resurgence of populist nationalism around the world – espoused most prominently by former US President Donald Trump and his latter-day “America First” movement – also has steadily eroded the rules-based international order that emerged after World War II. But even before Trump, many countries were asserting the primacy of their laws and policies over international rules and multilateral cooperation.

As a result, a pandemic of parochialism has infected many mature democracies to varying degrees. Nor has it been confined to instances of states refusing to implement the judgments of international courts – as China did when it dismissed the Permanent Court of Arbitration’s ruling against its claims in the South China Sea; and as the United Kingdom did when it refused to comply with the International Court of Justice’s advisory opinion ordering it to return the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean to Mauritius. Rather, these are symptoms of a new “variant of concern.”

Around the world, states are increasingly committing flagrant violations of international rules while still claiming to comply with them. And neither the United States nor the UK can claim fidelity to the post-war rules-based international order they played such a large role in constructing.

Last October, for example, when US President Joe Biden’s Senior Legal Adviser to the State Department, the highly respected international lawyer Harold Koh, left his post, he wrote a detailed objection to Biden’s continuation of Trump’s border policy. The Biden administration’s approach, Koh wrote, “continues to violate our legal obligation not to expel or return … individuals who fear persecution, death, or torture, especially migrants fleeing from Haiti.” He concluded that the policy was in breach of both the Convention against Torture and the Refugee Protocol.

Similarly, the UK House of Lords recently had to strike clauses from a Nationality and Borders Bill because they were manifestly in breach of the UN Refugee Convention, contrary to what Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government had claimed. A similar confrontation also looms over an attempt to reform the UK Human Rights Act. The Johnson government claims that its proposed changes would be compatible with the UK remaining a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights, even though the proposals flagrantly authorize “push back” against rulings by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).

This Humpty Dumpty approach to international law undermines the very rules-based system that both post-Brexit “Global Britain” and the Biden administration purport to promote abroad. If international law means whatever nation-states want it to mean, it is on the verge of becoming a dead letter.

Russia’s War of Aggression

Russia’s shocking and barbaric war against Ukraine marks a new low in this dangerous global trend toward international law doublespeak. Claiming that the invasion is justified in international law, Putin has offered a series of mendacious rationales, ranging from the right to pre-emptive self-defense to the responsibility to protect ethnic Russians in Ukraine from “genocide” (a brazen falsehood that echoes Hitler’s own justification for invading Czechoslovakia in 1939).

In fact, as an overwhelming majority of UN General Assembly members recognized last week, the invasion lacks any legal justification and constitutes an act of “aggression” in violation of the UN Charter. Aggression, otherwise known as a crime against peace, is one of the most serious crimes in international criminal law, along with genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.

Watch Now

In addition to unleashing terrible suffering – with thousands already dead and more than two million Ukrainian refugees having fled – Russia’s aggression highlights the world’s dependence on the international rule of law for peace, security, and prosperity. It is a wake-up call for states everywhere: neglect the erosion of the international rule of law at your peril.

When states commit such grave breaches, our commitment to the international rule of law – memorably described by former UK Senior Law Lord Tom Bingham as “the domestic rule of law writ large” – requires that there be effective institutional machinery to hold accountable those responsible, and to provide justice for those who have suffered.

This machinery is much more developed now than it was during World War II, thanks in part to the UK’s influence in constructing the post-war rules-based international order. States or individuals can now bring Russia before the ECHR in Strasbourg, and the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague can investigate, prosecute, and punish actions amounting to genocide, war crimes, or crimes against humanity. In fact, both processes have already begun.

Mind the Legal Gap

These institutions represent major improvements to the rule-of-law machinery that existed in the first half of the twentieth century. But there is still a significant gap, because no entity currently can investigate, prosecute, and punish the international crime of aggression against Ukraine. The recent expansion of the ICC’s jurisdiction to cover the crime of aggression does not extend to Russia’s actions on Ukrainian territory, because neither country is a party to the ICC statute.

The very existence of this gap could be seen as proof of the current system’s dysfunction. What kind of legal system recognizes certain wrongs as serious crimes but does not provide the institutional means for investigating, prosecuting, or punishing them?

Some might argue that this gap is irrelevant, because existing institutions could still hold Putin and his generals accountable for other offenses, such as violations of human rights, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. But it does matter, because the machinery to punish the crime of aggression would be more effective than those other channels in holding Putin’s inner circle accountable.

Aggression is a crime committed by leaders who plan, initiate, or have the power to influence or shape an overall policy of aggression. It applies to the top ranks, rather than to middle- or lower-ranking officials, and it is generally easier to prove than individual responsibility for specific acts amounting to war crimes or crimes against humanity. Moreover, it also would allow for those who have been complicit in aggression – for example, by providing material support to facilitate it – to be held responsible.

As such, the process of ensuring legal accountability is correspondingly swifter. In the short run, the threat of being brought to justice might encourage those who are systemically sustaining the war of aggression to begin to distance themselves from the regime. And in the long run, knowledge of this risk will act as a deterrent to future enablers of aggression.

The Case for a Special Tribunal

Given these potential outcomes, there is a growing chorus calling for the gap in the international rule-of-law machinery to be filled with a special tribunal to punish the crime of aggression against Ukraine. This body would complement, rather than compete with, the ICC, because it would have authority to act only where the ICC lacks prosecutorial power.

One such proposal, which has the Ukrainian government’s support, encourages states to form a coalition of the willing with Ukraine to create a special tribunal. Another proposal envisions a tribunal being established under the UN’s auspices, on the recommendation of the General Assembly. Notably, The Elders – a private organization of prominent former government and international leaders – has endorsed calls for a criminal tribunal to be established, though they have not specified how it should come into being.

Any of these proposals would fill the current institutional gap by enabling the victim state to ensure that aggression on its territory does not go unpunished. The modalities by which a special criminal tribunal is established are of secondary importance. What matters is that there is now a powerful movement to uphold the international rule of law by ensuring that there is no impunity for aggression. Russia’s aggression has thus created the conditions for reversing the disturbing trend of recent years.

What will it take to ensure that this historic opportunity is not missed? Rebuilding the international rule of law will require more than merely reasserting the supremacy of international rules over national laws and policies. For a restored system to endure, its reconstruction must account for the reasons why it was eroded in the first place.

One of those reasons is reflected in criticism of the proposals for a special tribunal. Some legal scholars argue that a special tribunal is a bad idea because it sends the message that international criminal justice is ultimately selective. According to this critique, the international rule of law would be subverted, rather than strengthened, by the hypocrisy and double standards involved in singling out Russian aggression when other states’ equally grave acts of aggression have gone unpunished.

This is a powerful critique that proponents of a special tribunal cannot simply dismiss. Nationalist attacks on international norms, institutions, and court rulings have found ready audiences among some electorates partly because there is a growing perception that the international rule of law is a Western imperial construct. Powerful states invoke international law when it suits their interests and conveniently overlook it when it does not.

As I have recently argued elsewhere, rebuilding the international rule of law requires that this critique be fully acknowledged. It is important that proposals invoking the rule of law be seen as manifestations of an inclusive and equitable multilateral system, not as mechanisms imposed solely by the Western powers that designed the post-war international order. But it is one thing to recognize the problem of selectivity; it is quite another thing to argue against the creation of a special tribunal on these grounds. That path leads to a counsel of despair, turning the perfect into the enemy of the good.

A Chance to Rebuild

A special tribunal to punish Russia’s crime of aggression against Ukraine would be a pragmatic way to start rebuilding our global institutions, in keeping with what former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown advocates in his recent book, Seven Ways to Change the World. Brown’s proposed strategy is grounded in universal values, but it would build the case for international cooperation issue by issue. Support for reform must be won, not demanded. States must show leadership and build coalitions of the responsible, persuading both governments and electorates that there are advantages in pooling national sovereignty.

Today’s proposals for a special tribunal are not about creating and imposing new international norms on the rest of the world. Aggression is a long-recognized international crime. The case that must be made now is for developing the institutional machinery to enable punishment of that crime. Russia’s aggression has summoned into being an extraordinary global consensus that there can be no impunity for such grave acts of aggression in the twenty-first century.

The ball is now in the court of those who aspire to global leadership on this issue, not least the UK, the US, and many European countries. The international rule of law faces existential threats around the world. But by developing the institutional machinery needed to uphold this powerful ideal, governments can demonstrate that their commitment to it is more than merely rhetorical. They have an opportunity to step back from rule-of-law doublespeak, to renew their commitments to abide by obligations they have voluntarily adopted, and to uphold the universally recognized norms of customary international law.

It is in everyone’s interest that international rules be consistently enforced. Rebuilding the international rule of law will take intelligent leadership and patient work, and that work must begin now.",https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/special-tribunal-putin-crime-of-aggression-by-murray-hunt-2022-03

10 Mar 2022 16.36 A report from the US Census Bureau released today reveals that the 2020 US census undercounted 18.8m Black, indigenous and Latino Americans. Here’s more from Maya Yang: The 2020 US census undercounted America’s Latino population at more than three times the rate of the 2010 census, according to a report released on Thursday by the US Census Bureau. The census also undercounted the nation’s Black and Native American residents, while overcounting non-Hispanic white people and Asian Americans. The census helps guide the annual federal distribution of $1.5tn for public services including education, healthcare and transportation. Undercounting communities results in reduced political representation on local, state and federal level. According to the report, Latinos had a net undercount of nearly 5%. The Black population had a net undercount of 3.3%, a slight increase from a 2.1% shortfall a decade ago. American Indian and Alaska Natives living on reservations had a net undercount of 5.6%, up from 4.9% in the last census. The non-Latino white population had a net overcount in the 2020 census of 1.6% while Asians had a net overcount of 2.6%. In comparison, the non-Latino white population had a net overcount of 0.8% in 2010 while Asians had a net undercount of 0.08% that year. Overall, the 2020 census overlooked 0.24% of the total US population. In 2010, the census missed 0.01% of the national population.

10 Mar 2022 15.49 Joe Biden had a phone call earlier today with Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan, where Erdogan reportedly urged Biden to lift the “unjust” sanctions on Turkey’s defense industry, according to a statement from Erdogan’s office. Erdogan informed Biden that Turkey is planning to request purchases of 40 new F-16 fighter jets as well as kits to modernize its existing fleet. Congress put sanctions on five Turkish officials after the Turkish government purchased Russian missile defense systems. A brief White House statement on Erdogan’s call with Biden did not mention any specific discussion of the sanctions but said that they “discussed opportunities to strengthen bilateral ties. The White House said that the leaders “discussed their shared concern about Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine” and Biden “expressed appreciation for Turkey’s efforts to support diplomatic resolution to the conflict”.



10 Mar 2022 15.27 Joan E Greve Democrats are pinning the blame for rising gas prices on Valdimir Putin and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, while accusing Republicans of exploiting the issue for political gain. On a press call with Democratic Senator Gary Peters today, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Jaime Harrison, said Republicans should focus more of their energy on trying to help average Americans struggling with the higher prices at the gas pump.

Republicans have argued that the high prices are the result of Joe Biden’s energy and climate policies, but Harrison noted the oil and gas industry is currently sitting on more than 9,000unused drilling permits in the US.

“Putin and this unjust war that he has sparked in Ukraine is the culprit behind why we’re seeing these gas prices skyrocket, particularly over the past few days,” Harrison said.



Biden has tried to send a similar message to the country, saying on Tuesday, “I’m going to do everything I can to minimize Putin’s price hike here at home.”

Average gas prices in the US have now hit a record high of $4.318, according to AAA. Experts warn prices will keep increasing as the war continues, especially now that Biden has announced a ban on Russian oil imports. Harrison said Thursday, “I hope that Republicans, instead of trying to use this as a political ploy, will actually roll up their sleeves and try to help alleviate some of the pressure off of American families as well.”



10 Mar 2022 15.08 The trial of four men charged with plotting to kidnap Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer in 2020 has kicked off this week. Jurors today heard disturbing audio recordings provided by a government informant of the men discussing their plan to kidnap Whitmer. Here’s more from the Associated Press: Prosecutors in the trial of four men charged with plotting to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Thursday played covertly recorded audio for jurors in which one of the men specifically discusses a plan to abduct the Democrat. In the recording, made by a government informant during a meeting in mid-July 2020 in Wisconsin, Barry Croft Jr. describes the possibility of using explosives to “rain down” fire on law enforcement “with a team standing by” to abduct Whitmer. He adds without providing details that it should be “a quick precise grab” of the governor. In another recording made by the same informant, jurors heard the sound of an explosives test Croft was conducting. He’s later heard speaking almost giddily about the damage he could cause, saying it would be “devastating.” Prosecutors say the men — Croft, Adam Fox, Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta — planned to snatch Whitmer from her Michigan vacation home because they were angry about pandemic restrictions she imposed. They also planned to blow up a nearby bridge to slow the police response. The audio played in the federal courtroom in Grand Rapids, Michigan, marked the first time the jury heard a defendant talking specifically about abducting Whitmer. In other recordings played, Croft and Fox mentioned Whitmer and spoke excitedly about taking action that would terrorize people. “I’m gonna hit soon,” Croft is heard saying during what prosecutors say was a crucial June 6, 2020, meeting of antigovernment activists in Ohio. “ I’m going to terrorize people. The right people. The people who have been terrorizing my people.”

What our focus is on now is doing everything we can to mitigate and reduce those prices and ensure there isn’t a longer term impact.” A report from the labor department earlier today showed that inflation jumped 7.9% over the past year – the highest increase since 1982. Psaki emphasized that the inflation seen over the next few months is higher than what it would have been if Russia had not invaded Ukraine. Answering a question from a reporter on what the White House can tell Americans who are wondering how long inflation will lsat, Psaki pointed to the effectiveness of US sanctions against Russia. “Because of our efforts, the ruble is worth a penny. It’s the lowest-ranked currency. The Russian stock market has not even opened,” Psaki said. “You’ve seen outcry from a number of President Putin’s buddies… who we have all been squeezing.”

In the thread, Psaki said, “it’s Russia that continues to support the Assad regime in Syria, which has repeatedly used chemical weapons. It’s Russia that has long maintained a biological weapons program in violation of international law.” It’s Russia that continues to support the Assad regime in Syria, which has repeatedly used chemical weapons.

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.
