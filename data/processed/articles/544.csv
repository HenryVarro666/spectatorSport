President Biden said he will designate Colombia as a major non-NATO ally, telling President Iván Duque during a White House visit that Colombia is ""the essential partnership we need in this hemisphere.""

The meeting comes as the United States works to shore up relationships in the hemisphere at a time when Russia has worked to expand its influence in the region through ties with Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua — and high-profile meetings with the presidents of Argentina and Brazil.

Biden thanked Duque for condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Duque said ""has been a horrifying moment for the world.""

""Nothing justifies the bloodbath that we have been seeing,"" Duque said.

Duque has been one of the more outspoken leaders in the region about the invasion of Ukraine and the dangers of Russian influence. It's a message the United States would clearly like to see take hold.

""President Duque has been particularly outspoken on the linkages between Russia and certain countries of the region, especially Venezuela,"" Kevin Whitaker, a former U.S. ambassador to Colombia who also served as a diplomat in Venezuela, told reporters on a briefing call ahead of the meeting.

For Russia, ""to see one of its more closer and more trusted partners in South America having direct discussions with the U.S. government can only be a matter of concern,"" Whitaker said.

The meeting comes days after a secret trip to Venezuela

The meeting came just days after a secret weekend trip to Caracas by senior administration officials to meet with Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, who is is not currently recognized as its president by the United States. Officials told reporters it was the first such high-level visit since the late 1990s.

Venezuela's oil industry has become entwined with Russia, particularly since U.S. sanctions on Caracas shut the door to oil trade. With Russia now heavily sanctioned over the invasion with Ukraine, American officials saw a ""unique environment"" to advance U.S. national security interests, a senior administration official said.

After the visit, two Americans long detained in Venezuela were released:

Gustavo Cárdenas, one of six executives of gas company Citgo arrested during a 2017 work trip and later charged with corruption

Jorge Alberto Fernández, a Cuban American man arrested on separate charges last year

""We traveled down there to secure the release of detained Americans and to urge a return to the negotiating table"" with Venezuela's opposition, one of the officials said. ""We see a negotiated outcome as really the only way forward toward a peaceful restoration of democratic order in the country.""

The U.S. cut diplomatic ties with Caracas years ago

The White House has said that energy security was also part of conversations. The administration, which banned imports of Russian oil this week, has been looking for ways to take the edge off record gasoline prices.

While it's too early to say what the Caracas meeting will mean for future relations, it's a significant step as the White House looks for more ways to isolate Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.

Venezuela has some of the largest oil reserves in the world and used to export a significant portion to the United States.

But that stopped with sanctions aimed at punishing Maduro for human rights abuses and undermining democracy. Caracas has since become closely tied to Moscow, particularly when it comes to selling its oil.

Restarting trade would be complicated, given that the United States does not recognize Maduro as the Venezuelan president. He's also been indicted in the United States on drug trafficking charges.

There are domestic political concerns about dealing with Maduro

In some of South Florida's Latin American communities, what the Biden administration is doing is seen as hypocritical.

Eddy Acevedo, who served as the national security adviser for the U.S. Agency for International Development during the Trump administration, says negotiating with Maduro is wrong.

""It does undermine President Biden's notion here about being strong against dictators,"" said Acevedo, who is now at the Wilson Center. ""You cannot be inconsistent on that and try to punish Putin and reward Maduro at the same time.""

Acevedo said that even if the White House wanted Venezuela wanted to fill the void left by Russia, it would not be able to. Despite sitting on large oil reserves, production has dropped tremendously during Maduro's tenure and is a fraction of what is produced by Russia.

The White House also downplayed the chances of a quick resumption in trade. ""As you are assessing how to spend your energies in this time of a lot of news in the world, I would not focus a lot of them on conversations about the future of the United States importing oil at this point in time ... from Venezuela,"" press secretary Jen Psaki said.

Colombia's Duque is not a fan of Maduro either

Duque's energy minister warned against the idea of working with Venezuela on oil. In an interview with The Financial Times, Diego Mesa said: ""If you've just banned oil from what they call the Russian dictator, it's difficult to explain why are you going to be buying oil from the Venezuelan dictator.""

Biden and Duque did not mention the Caracas trip during the public portion of their meeting, though Biden praised Duque for the way his country has handled 1.8 million migrants from Venezuela in recent years.

After the meeting, Duque declined to tell reporters whether he spoke to Biden about the new engagement with Maduro, saying that both Colombia and the United States agree that they want to see democracy return to Venezuala.

""Nicolas Maduro is a dictator and we have condemned that dictatorship and have sued Nicolas Maduro before the International Criminal Court,"" Duque said.",https://www.npr.org/2022/03/09/1085512093/russias-war-on-ukraine-has-hurt-oil-prices-and-now-the-u-s-is-talking-to-venezue

An oil refining plant in Puerto La Cruz, Venezuela. US officials travelled to Caracas over the weekend for talks on potentially allowing the country to sell its oil on the international market.

Venezuela released two jailed US citizens on Tuesday in an apparent goodwill gesture toward the Biden administration, which has reached out to the regime of Nicolas Maduro as it looks for help in shutting off Russia’s oil revenues amid the war in Ukraine.

The release of US nationals Gustavo Cardenas and Jose Alberto Fernandez followed a weekend visit by senior White House and State Department officials that Maduro described as “respectful, cordial, very diplomatic”.

It also came just hours after Biden announced a ban on Russian oil and other energy sources, part of efforts to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine.

Venezuela, a key ally of the Kremlin, has emerged as a potential alternative source of oil as Washington looks for ways to inflict economic pain on Russia while also limiting the pain for US consumers exposed to surging fuel prices.

As White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Monday, the purpose of the trip to Venezuela was to discuss a range of issues, including energy security.

Calming jittery markets

The talks in Caracas marked a first since the countries severed diplomatic relations in 2019, a year after Maduro’s victory in a presidential election the West described as a sham. Then US president Donald Trump slapped crippling sanctions on Venezuelan oil in an attempt to starve Maduro’s regime of cash.

According to US media, Biden’s envoys floated the prospect of suspending at least part of those sanctions during the talks in Caracas, which were also aimed at gauging Maduro’s readiness to distance himself from Russia.

While the talks have raised eyebrows in Congress, “giving them plenty of publicity is certainly in Washington's interest – if only to reassure the financial markets”, said Alexandre Baradez, an analyst at IG France, in an interview with FRANCE 24.

In recent days, the prospect of Western countries slowing or halting imports of Russian gas and oil has fuelled panic across the markets, pushing the price of Brent oil close to 140 dollars a barrel on Monday – its highest level in over a decade.

That figure “summed up the fears of investors regarding the war’s economic pact and the possibility of an embargo on Russian oil”, said Baradez.

“The psychological factor is crucial,” he added. “If investors see that the US is actively looking for an alternative to Russian oil, then they will be less likely to anticipate a worst-case scenario in which oil prices jump to 200 dollars or more.”

Can Venezuela make up for Russian oil?

Venezuela, home to the world’s largest known oil reserves, has enough fuel in its tank to prevent such a scenario – at least on paper.

“Last year, the United States imported around 650,000 barrels of Russian oil per day, roughly the amount they bought from Venezuela before imposing sanctions in 2019,” said Igor Hernandez, an expert in Venezuela's energy sector at Rice University’s Baker Institute in Houston. “The US used Russia as a substitute for Venezuela. So if sanctions are lifted, one could imagine switching back to the situation prior to 2019.”

In practice, however, Venezuela’s capacity to rapidly meet US demands is limited by the country’s economic crisis and the effects of Washington’s sanctions, which have crippled its energy infrastructure.

“Last year, oil output crawled up to between 600,000 and 650,000 barrels a day (up from 560,000 barrels in 2020) and there are margins for improvement. But we’re still way off the country’s pre-2019 production capacity,” Hernandez added.

Before US sanctions, Venezuela’s state-owned oil company PDVSA could produce over 1 million barrels per day. It will struggle to recover that capacity, not least “because it is highly constrained in its ability to use the revenue from oil exports”, Hernandez added, noting that the company is closely linked to Russian banks, which are also targeted by sanctions.

“They will probably need to reach out to the private sector to finance their activities,” said Hernandez, though cautioning that creditors will be reluctant to engage with a company that is already in arrears. “You’d also need credible signs from the government that it intends to honour PDVSA’s contracts, but the Maduro regime has a notorious reputation in this domain,” he added.

In substance, said Baradez, “the US would probably have to help rebuild Venezuela’s oil industry” – a highly sensitive proposition, considering the bipartisan opposition to Maduro in Washington.

The Biden administration has already faced strong criticism on Capitol Hill for its contact with Maduro, who is under US sanctions for human rights abuses and political repression.

“The White House offered to abandon those seeking freedom from Venezuela in exchange for an insignificant amount of oil,” Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, said in a tweet on Tuesday.

Senator Robert Menendez, a Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, urged the White House not to pursue a deal with Venezuela. Maduro, he said in a statement, “is a cancer to our hemisphere and we should not breathe new life into his reign of torture and murder”.

Would Maduro betray Putin?

Before it can begin to breathe new life into Venezuela’s oil industry, the White House would still have to get Maduro – a staunch ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin – to agree to pile pressure on the Kremlin.

So far, Hugo Chavez’s successor has sided resolutely with Moscow, even “recognising the independence of [Ukraine's] two separatist republics of the Donbas just hours after Putin”, said Maximilian Hess, a political analyst at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in London.

“Maduro will start by assessing what Washington is willing to give him and his entourage,” said Hess. “If it’s not enough, he will stick to his alliance with Russia, which he still regards as his insurance policy, should the political and economic situation in Venezuela become too risky for him.”

Oil prices continue to rise after US bans Russian energy imports 03:36

In this respect, lifting US sanctions alone may not be enough to sway the Venezuelan president, Hess observed. “Maduro will be more receptive if Biden makes concessions on other issues, such as the legal cases in US courts targeting members of his government and PDVSA.”

Still, the prospect of sanctions relief would be hugely tempting for cash-strapped Venezuela, “allowing the country to divert part of its exports from China to the US, thereby slashing costs and improving public finances”, said Hernandez. And Caracas has comparatively little to lose should Moscow choose to retaliate, “since Russia has invested very little in Venezuela since 2019”.

Washington’s tentative rapprochement with Venezuela runs parallel with US efforts to finalise a new deal on Iran’s nuclear programme, which would pave the way for the resumption of Iranian oil exports and reduce Tehran’s dependence on Russia.

“If the United States can sway both Venezuela and Iran it would mark a huge diplomatic coup,” said Hess, noting that Washington has already dealt stinging blows to the Kremlin by persuading the likes of South Korea – “which traditionally cultivates friendly ties with Russia” –, Singapore and Switzerland to distance themselves from Moscow.

Venezuelan oil would be a perfect substitute for Russian oil in large part because Russian oil has been a perfect substitute for Venezuelan oil. Much of the oil refining industry on the U.S. Gulf Coast is built for heavy crude oil like that produced by Venezuela—some, such as the Citgo refinery in Lake Charles, Louisiana, was built specifically for Venezuelan crude. These refineries cannot run at capacity producing gasoline and other petroleum products from light oil grades such as those produced by U.S. shale drillers or Saudi Arabia, and there is not enough pipeline capacity to bring heavier oil grades down from Canada. When sanctions were levied on the Venezuelan oil industry, U.S. refiners’ sudden supply shortages were filled by Russia, which also produces a heavier grade. Indeed, Russian oil deliveries to the United States have roughly doubled since the start of U.S. oil sanctions on Venezuela in 2019.

However, this sudden interest should not come as a surprise. Western countries’ unprecedented sanctions aimed at isolating Russian President Vladimir Putin have understandably generated a focus on alternative oil suppliers, including Venezuela, whose oil the United States has sanctioned since 2019. Across the political spectrum, commentators from Fareed Zakaria to Trish Regan have called on the United States to lift sanctions on Venezuela to help compensate for the loss of oil from Russia. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the administration is currently communicating with European allies about a boycott of Russian oil, “while making sure that there is still an appropriate supply of oil on world markets.”

As the Biden administration scrambles to prepare for a potential embargo of Russian oil, it sent officials to Caracas this past weekend to meet with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Facilitated by Swiss diplomats, the trip saw Juan Gonzalez, the senior director for the Western Hemisphere at the National Security Council; Roger Carstens, the special envoy for hostage affairs; and Ambassador to Venezuela Jimmy Story meet directly with Maduro. This was highly unexpected, considering there have been no high-level meetings between the United States and Venezuela in more than five years. Up until Russia’s recent invasion of Ukraine, the Biden administration had consistently suggested Maduro needs to negotiate not with Washington but with the Venezuelan opposition.

Indeed, Russian oil deliveries to the United States have roughly doubled since the start of U.S. oil sanctions on Venezuela in 2019.

The geopolitics do not end there. One of Putin’s motivations in deepening Russia’s relationship with Venezuela in recent years may have been precisely to counterbalance U.S. and European support for Ukraine. Indeed as former U.S. National Security Council senior official Fiona Hill testified in Congress in 2019, the Russians at one time even offered the Trump administration a deal to swap Venezuela for Ukraine.

Maduro should be concerned that, should Russia win control over Ukraine, Putin could lose interest in Venezuela as a chip. Of course, Russia could become more interested as well, depending on the course of the invasion. However, the uncertainty likely has Maduro’s attention. He has loudly support ed Putin in the media—but also seems to be hedging his bets. For example, Venezuela quietly abstained from the United Nations Human Rights Council vote on establishing an international commission of inquiry regarding Russia’s war in Ukraine.

In addition to addressing oil needs, this diplomatic initiative has great potential to shake up the stalemate of Venezuelan politics.

Simply peeling Maduro away from Putin is probably not in the cards. Venezuela’s relationship with Russia started gaining significance during the government of Hugo Chávez and has seriously deepened under his successor. Maduro largely survived the pressure of the past three years because of Russian military and diplomatic support—and because Russia helped him skirt U.S. sanctions. A quick about-face in U.S. policy due to an extraordinary geopolitical contingency does not come close to creating the trust that would get Maduro to turn on a crucial ally. However, directly engaging the Maduro government at least rolls the ball in the right direction.

The results of the trip are still unclear, but an announcement is expected soon. Insiders suggest the U.S. delegation expressed a willingness to provide U.S. and European companies operating in Venezuela with licenses allowing greater flexibility in operations and access to Venezuelan oil and natural gas. In pursuit of this partial sanctions relief, Maduro has committed to returning to negotiations with the Venezuelan opposition. Talks had begun in Mexico City in August 2021 but were frozen by Maduro two months later, following the extradition of an alleged Maduro financier, the Colombian businessman Alex Saab, from Cape Verde to face money laundering charges in the United States. There may also be a release of some Venezuelan political prisoners and U.S. citizens being detained in Venezuela. This could include Matthew Heath, a former U.S. Marine jailed on terrorism and arms trafficking charges, and members of the so-called Citgo Six—Venezuelan American oil executives detained since 2017 on corruption charges.

In addition to addressing U.S. oil needs, this diplomatic initiative has great potential to shake up the tragic stalemate of Venezuelan politics, where an unpopular authoritarian government is oppressing its people and an opposition movement led by former Popular Will party leader Juan Guaidó has lost its steam. As urgent as it is to put a stop to Putin, the Biden administration needs to make sure that any oil deal with the Maduro government works to strengthen the rights of Venezuelans rather than strengthening a dictator.

This more recent push comes amid calls over the past year for the administration to engage the Maduro government—or at least review sanctions. Leading voices in support of a new U.S. Venezuela policy include House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Gregory Meeks, Sen. Chris Murphy, and civil society organizations advocating for a negotiated political agreement. Of course, Maduro has long expressed the desire to cut a deal. Guaidó, too, presented a plan in January for Washington to alleviate sanctions to get Maduro back to the negotiation table.

The Biden administration, however, had been dragging its feet on Venezuela until now. This is in large part because it fears any letup of U.S. pressure on Maduro will cost the Democrats votes in South Florida. There, a strong Venezuelan diaspora has followed in the footsteps of Cuban expats in favoring hard-line policies toward the government it fled.

Predictably, this week’s negotiations have riled Republican hard-liners who see any diplomatic engagement with foes as appeasement. Their criticisms are clearly motivated by U.S. domestic politics—but should not be dismissed out of hand. There is, in fact, no guarantee that diplomatic engagement will improve the lot of Venezuelans suffering from years of increasing authoritarianism and economic collapse. If handled well, the negotiations could jump-start the stalled intra-Venezuelan talks in Mexico or even lead directly to democratic concessions. But if handled poorly, they could end up sacrificing the Venezuelan people’s fight against one authoritarian leader in favor of the Ukrainian people’s fight against another authoritarian leader.

Since the Biden administration has already assumed the political costs for this effort, it should now follow through and make sure they bear fruit. It would be good for U.S. negotiators to focus not just on prisoner release but also on broader human rights issues, such as improving electoral institutions, stopping the judicial persecution of opposition politicians, and ceasing harassment of journalists and activists. While economic sanctions like those on oil should be negotiated, individual sanctions on regime officials who have committed grave human rights violations or other crimes should continue.

Getting a commitment from the Maduro government to return to the Mexico talks is an important success. Getting its commitment to make progress there would be even more important. The Maduro government has developed a modus operandi of using dialogue as a nonbinding substitute for the democratic institutions it has undermined. Getting Maduro to commit to a road map for negotiations—with benchmarks for humanitarian improvements, restoring the rule of law, and an election calendar—could spur the return to democracy Venezuelan citizens have been struggling for.",https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/03/08/venezuela-maduro-sanctions-oil-deal-russia-war-ukraine-democracy-geopolitics/
3,7c4a1d4a-b005-44d5-a8e9-e09542cae266,[],,"Washington — The Venezuelan government has freed two jailed Americans, including an oil executive imprisoned alongside colleagues for more than four years, as it seeks to improve relations with the Biden administration amid Russia's war with Ukraine, the White House announced Tuesday night.

Gustavo Cardenas was released following a secret weekend visit to Venezuela by senior Biden administration officials, the first White House trip to the county in more than two decades. Also freed was Jorge Fernandez, who was arrested last year on what the White House described as ""spurious charges.""

""These men are fathers who lost precious time with their children and everyone they love, and their families have suffered every day of their absence,"" President Joe Biden said in a statement.

The release came hours after Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro signaled an interest in improving relations at a time when Russia's invasion of Ukraine has sparked concerns in the United States over rising gas prices. In a televised address, he appeared to indicate he was willing to accede to U.S. demands that he resume negotiations with his opponents as a first building block for any relief from U.S. sanctions that have been punishing the OPEC nation for years.

U.S. officials have not detailed any other specific outcomes of the talks, but said the release reflected months of relationship-building, particularly involving Roger Carstens, the administration's special presidential envoy for hostage affairs.

Carstens made a trip to Venezuela in December that did not immediately result in the release of detainees but that senior administration officials credited with establishing trust and laying the groundwork for Tuesday's outcome. He returned to Venezuela last weekend with other administration officials including Juan Gonzalez, the National Security Council director for the Western Hemisphere, and Ambassador James Story, who heads the U.S. government's Venezuelan Affairs Unit out of neighboring Colombia.

The Biden administration described it as the first Venezuela visit by a White House official since Hugo Chavez led the country in the late 1990s, and a rare opportunity to discuss policy issues with the Maduro government. One official described it as ""a constructive, diplomatic but very candid dialogue"" and that did not entail any quid-pro-quo but enabled the Biden administration to share its ""view of the world"" with Maduro.

Senior administration officials, speaking to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the government, declined to say how Cardenas and Fernandez were selected for release among nearly 10 American detainees held in Venezuela. But they said Carstens pushed hard for the release of all of them, and that the possibility of additional releases remains.

Cardenas and five other executives of Houston-based Citgo, a subsidiary of Venezuela's state-owned oil giant, had been in detention in Venezuela since 2017 when they were led away by masked security agents while at a meeting in Caracas. They had been lured to Venezuela in order to attend a meeting at the headquarters of Citgo's parent, state-run oil giant PDVSA.

They were sentenced on charges stemming from a never executed plan to refinance some $4 billion in Citgo bonds by offering a 50% stake in the company as collateral. Prosecutors accused the men of maneuvering to benefit from the proposed deal.

The U.S. government pressed for their release, calling them wrongful detainees held without a fair trial.

Besides the other members of the Citgo 6, several other Americans remain held in Venezuela. Two former Green Berets, Luke Denman and Airan Berry, were arrested for their alleged involvement in a confusing plot to overthrow Maduro, and former U.S. Marine Matthew Heath was detained on weapons charges.

Fernandez was detained in February 2021 near the border with Colombia after he was found in possession of a drone, whose use is restricted in Venezuela. He was accused of terrorism.

Gonzalo Himiob, a lawyer and vice president director of Foro Penal, said in a statement that the end of an arbitrary detention should be celebrated but warned of the consequences that can come from an agreement like the one that led to Cardenas' release.

""The release of any political prisoner, when it arises from an agreement between political actors, and not from respect for the law, confirms that from the beginning the reasons for the detention were neither legal nor valid, but political and, consequently, arbitrary and contrary to human rights,"" Himiob said.

The weekend discussions came a little more than three years after the U.S. broke off relations with Maduro and recognized opposition leader Juan Guaidó as Venezuela's legitimate leader.

The talks came together after months of backchannel efforts by intermediaries - American lobbyists, Norwegian diplomats and international oil executives - who have been pushing for Mr. Biden to revisit the so far unsuccessful ""maximum pressure"" campaign to unseat Maduro that he inherited from the Trump administration.

But the impetus for the outreach to Maduro, who has been sanctioned and is indicted in New York on drug trafficking charges, took on added urgency following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and ensuing U.S. sanctions. The Ukraine crisis promises to reshuffle global alliances and add to rising gas prices driving inflation that is already at a four-decade high.

Powerful Democrats and Republicans alike on Capitol Hill last week began voicing support for a U.S. ban on Russian oil and natural gas imports as the next step to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for the invasion. Mr. Biden announced such a ban on Tuesday.

Venezuela is Putin's top ally in Latin America and a top oil exporter. Its reentry into U.S. energy markets could mitigate the fallout at the pump from a possible oil embargo on Russia. But the discussions in Caracas were quickly condemned by top Democrat and Republic senators.

U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Mr. Biden's efforts to unite the world against Putin ""should not be undercut by propping up"" Maduro, whose government is under investigation by the International Criminal Court for possible crimes against humanity committed against protesters in 2017.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/venezuela-two-americans-ukraine-war-rethinking-hostile-relationship/

Driving the news: Maduro released two American hostages this week following the meeting, potentially heralding a thaw in relations. But the reengagement with Maduro has sparked backlash from some lawmakers in Washington, who fear President Biden is about to relax sanctions to get more Venezuelan oil onto the market.

A senior Biden administration official told reporters on Wednesday that the talks had only two objectives: to secure the release of the detainees, and to urge the regime to return to the negotiating table with the Venezuelan opposition.

""There is no dialogue between us and the regime. Dialogue really has to be between the Venezuelan people on the future of the country. And we’ve made clear that we are ready to lift international pressure on the basis of progress at those talks,"" the senior administration official said.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki reiterated Thursday that ""there is not currently, at this moment, an active conversation about importing their oil.""

Between the lines: The war in Ukraine and Biden's decision to ban oil, gas and coal from Russia are causing gas prices to spike, and forcing the U.S. to reappraise its relations with other controversial oil producers, such as Saudi Arabia.

Venezuela's oil production has fallen sharply due to U.S. sanctions and mismanagement of the sector by Maduro, but it is one of the few countries that could significantly ramp up supply.

The other side: The U.S. still recognizes Juan Guaidó as the legitimate president of Venezuela, not Maduro.

Guaidó's interim government released a statement on Wednesday thanking the U.S. for its help in trying to restart the negotiations but arguing that sanctions shouldn't be lifted until there are ""actual advances towards democracy and Venezuela's freedom.""

""The easing of any sort of pressure, if it is not oriented towards democratization, will only strengthen the authoritarianism that today threatens the world,"" the statement said.

The White House said Monday that a US delegation met with Venezuelan government officials in Caracas over the weekend for talks that included a discussion of energy supplies, as Washington seeks ways to lessen its reliance on Russian oil.

Venezuela's opposition also stated that it met with a high-level US delegation, whose visit to Caracas coincided with Washington's efforts to isolate Russia over its special military operation in Ukraine.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, whose regime the US severed ties with in 2019, was one of the international figures to assure Russian President Vladimir Putin of his ""strong support"" in the aftermath of the operation.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that “the purpose of the trip to Venezuela that was taken by administration officials was to discuss a range of issues including certain energy, energy security.""

Maduro confirmed the meeting in a televised appearance late Monday, calling it ""respectful, cordial, and diplomatic,"" but did not provide further details on the discussions.

""We did it in the presidential office,"" he said. ""We had almost two hours talking.""

""It seemed very important to me to be able, face to face, to discuss topics of maximum interest to Venezuela,"" he added.

The alternative to Russian oil

The US has imposed a slew of sanctions on Caracas in an attempt to oust Maduro, with one 2019 measure prohibiting Venezuela from trading its crude oil – which accounts for 96 percent of the country's revenue – on the US market.

According to The New York Times, the visit by senior State Department and White House officials was related to Washington's alleged interest in replacing a portion of the oil it currently buys from Russia with oil it no longer buys from Venezuela.

The White House has indicated that it is looking into ways to reduce Russian oil imports without harming US consumers and while maintaining global supply – though Psaki said Monday that no decision on a possible ban on Russian oil had been made.

US policy shifts with shifting tides

Since cutting diplomatic ties with Caracas, Washington has refused to deal with the Maduro government, instead of recognizing opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate president.

According to Guaido's office, the opposition-held a ""sustained meeting"" with the US delegation.

Maduro also announced the resumption of talks with the opposition, which had been stalled for five months.

Last month, Washington signaled that it was willing to reconsider its sanctions policy toward Venezuela if talks between Maduro's government and the opposition progressed.

The announcement came in response to Maduro's request for a peace conference following Russia's military operation in Ukraine in order to avoid a ""third world war.""

""We are ringing the warning bell... to the whole world,"" said Maduro, calling for ""humanitarian corridors"" in Ukraine to be respected.

""We are gravely concerned about the possibility of a war in Europe and an extension... of this armed confrontation, it seems to fester, a public media campaign of hatred and a set of economic measures aimed at aggravating the conditions and extending the scenario of war,"" added Maduro.

In a tweet, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele questioned US’ motives, saying that ""the US government decides who the bad guy is and who the good guy is and also when the bad guy becomes good and the good guy becomes bad.""

On February 24, Russia launched a special operation to demilitarize and ""denazify"" Ukraine in response to DPR and LPR calls for assistance in countering Ukrainian troop aggression. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, the special operation is only targeting Ukrainian military infrastructure and poses no threat to civilians. Moscow has repeatedly stated that it has no intention of occupying Ukraine.",https://english.almayadeen.net/news/politics/us-urgently-reaches-out-to-venezuela-amid-possible-energy-cr

Gustavo Cardenas arrived at his home in Houston at 4 a.m. Wednesday after flying overnight from Caracas with a senior State Department official sent to negotiate the release of American prisoners in the South American country.

In a statement to the Associated Press, he said his imprisonment of more than four years “has caused a lot of suffering and pain, much more than I can explain with my words.”

“I got out of jail and got my freedom after about 1,570 days of wrongful captivity. It was a very hard time marked by deep pain, but also by faith, hope, love and survival,” he said.

He called for the prompt release of the remaining members of the Citgo 6 — for the Houston oil company where they all worked. “They and their families deserve the same blessings and freedom that I got last night,” he said.

He credited his release to President Biden and other U.S. officials as well as the support received from former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson and Mickey Bergman of the Richardson Center, which has worked to secure the release of dozens of Americans detained abroad.

Notably absent was any mention of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, whose government jailed the men when they traveled on a corporate jet to Caracas around Thanksgiving 2017 for what they thought was an emergency meeting with Citgo’s parent company, state-run oil giant PDVSA.

Instead, masked security forces bearing assault rifles busted into a conference room and arrested the men. Later they were sentenced on charges stemming from a never-executed plan to refinance some $4 billion in Citgo bonds by offering a 50% stake in the company as collateral. Prosecutors accused the men of maneuvering to benefit from the proposed deal.

They’ve always maintained their innocence even as the U.S. has accused Maduro of using them as political bargaining chips to extract concessions from the U.S.

The release of Cardenas and Jorge Fernández, an American imprisoned in Venezuela who was not a member of the Citgo 6, came hours after Maduro signaled an interest in improving relations with the U.S. amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and concerns in the United States over rising gas prices. In a televised address, he appeared to indicate he was willing to accede to U.S. demands that he resume negotiations with his opponents as a first building block for any relief from U.S. sanctions that have been punishing the oil-producing nation for years.

U.S. officials have not detailed any other specific outcomes of the talks, but said the release reflected months of relationship-building, particularly involving Roger Carstens, the administration’s special presidential envoy for hostage affairs who accompanied Cardenas and Fernandez back to the U.S.

Carstens made a trip to Venezuela in December that did not immediately result in the release of detainees but that senior administration officials credited with establishing trust and laying the groundwork for Tuesday’s outcome. He returned to Venezuela last weekend with other administration officials including Juan Gonzalez, the National Security Council director for the Western Hemisphere, and Ambassador James Story, who heads the U.S. government’s Venezuelan Affairs Unit out of neighboring Colombia.

The Biden administration described it as the first visit to Venezuela by a White House official since Hugo Chavez led the country in the late 1990s, and a rare opportunity to discuss policy issues with the Maduro government. One official described it as “a constructive, diplomatic but very candid dialogue” that did not entail any quid pro quo but allowed the Biden administration to share its “view of the world” with Maduro.

Besides the other members of the Citgo 6, several other Americans remain held in Venezuela. Two former Green Berets, Luke Denman and Airan Berry, were arrested on allegations that they were involved in a confusing plot to overthrow Maduro, and former U.S. Marine Matthew Heath was detained on weapons charges.

Fernandez was detained in February 2021 near the border with Colombia after he was found in possession of a drone, the use of which is restricted in Venezuela. He was accused of terrorism.

The weekend discussions came a little more than three years after the U.S. broke off relations with Maduro and recognized opposition leader Juan Guaidó as Venezuela’s legitimate leader. The talks came together after months of back-channel efforts by intermediaries — American lobbyists, Norwegian diplomats and international oil executives — who have been pushing for Biden to revisit the “maximum pressure” campaign to unseat Maduro that he inherited from the Trump administration.

But the impetus for the outreach to Maduro, who has been sanctioned and is indicted in New York on drug trafficking charges, took on added urgency following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and ensuing U.S. sanctions. The Ukraine crisis promises to reshuffle global alliances and add to rising gas prices and driving inflation already at a four-decade high.

Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill last week began voicing support for a U.S. ban on Russian oil and natural gas imports as the next step to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for the invasion.

Venezuela is Putin’s top ally in Latin America and a top oil exporter. Its reentry into U.S. energy markets could mitigate the fallout at the pump from a possible oil embargo on Russia. But the discussions in Caracas were quickly condemned by top Democratic and Republican senators.

Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Biden’s efforts to unite the world against Putin “should not be undercut by propping up” Maduro, whose government is under investigation by the International Criminal Court for possible crimes against humanity committed against protesters in 2017.

The U.S.-backed faction of the opposition on Wednesday insisted that it remains open to resuming negotiations with Maduro with the goal of scheduling free and fair presidential and congressional elections, and said any easing of economic sanctions must be accompanied by advances toward democracy.

“The lifting of any measure of pressure, if it is not oriented toward democratization, would only strengthen the authoritarianism that threatens the world today,” the group said in a statement. “Only a Venezuela with democratic, institutional and transparency guarantees can be a reliable and efficient energy provider for the world.”",https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-03-08/venezuela-jailed-american-release

""We had almost two hours talking.""""It seemed very important to me to be able, face to face, to discuss topics of maximum interest to Venezuela,"" he continued.The United States has imposed a battery of sanctions on Caracas in a bid to force Maduro from power, with one 2019 measure preventing Venezuela from trading its crude oil -- which accounted for 96 percent of the country's revenues -- on the US market.According to The New York Times, the visit by senior State Department and White House officials was linked to Washington's alleged interest in replacing part of the oil it currently buys from Russia with the oil it stopped buying from Venezuela.The White House has indicated it is examining how to reduce Russian oil imports without harming US consumers and while maintaining global supply -- although Psaki said Monday no decision had been made on a possible ban on Russian oil.Since breaking off diplomatic relations with Caracas, Washington has refused to deal with the Maduro government, instead treating opposition leader Juan Guaido as the South American country's legitimate president.Psaki said the delegation also raised the ""health and welfare"" of a number of Americans detained in the country -- who include six oil executives jailed in 2017 -- but stressed that energy talks and the detainees' fate were ""separate paths and conversations.""Guaido's office said that the opposition held a ""sustained meeting"" with the US delegation.The United States is one of almost 60 countries to have recognized Guaido as Venezuela's acting president, having rejected Maduro's 2018 reelection in a poll widely viewed as fraudulent.Washington signaled last month it would be willing to review its sanctions policy toward Venezuela if talks between Maduro's government and the opposition -- launched in August but suspended since October -- moved forward.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-envoys-held-energy-talks-with-venezuelas-maduro-white-house/articleshow/90067999.cms

The blatantly hypocritical course of action confirms, once again, that American interests will always win out, no matter who is involved.

When it comes to recent U.S.-Venezuela policy, the situation is even more cynical and complex than meets the eye.

Just over a year ago, the Biden administration maintained the Trump administration’s hard-line stance toward Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Back then, the U.S. did not consider Maduro the country’s legitimate president but, like Trump, deemed Juan Guaidó, who still has not recovered from a failed uprising in 2019, as the country’s president.

“I certainly don't expect this administration to be engaging directly with Maduro,” a State Department spokesperson said last February, adding, “We certainly don't expect any contact with Maduro anytime soon.”

Yet, 13 months later, secret visits to Venezuela are taking place now that U.S. gas prices have climbed to their highest rate since 2008.

The hypocrisy is clear. But when it comes to recent U.S.-Venezuela policy, the situation is even more cynical and complex than meets the eye. President Joe Biden is taking a political risk by banking on the hope that bringing Venezuela back into the fold for oil will help stave off what he said Tuesday was “Putin’s price hike” on gas. But such a risk could eventually haunt his administration.

Biden's hard-line anti-Maduro stance had already softened a bit. In December, senior Biden official Roger Carstens, one of the officials who secretly traveled to Venezuela this past weekend, paid a visit to nine Americans detained by the Maduro government. From Caracas, Maduro himself said Tuesday that he was open to improving relations with the U.S., citing the weekend visit in some of his remarks. By Tuesday night, Maduro was releasing two of those American prisoners.

“We have agreed to work on an agenda going forward, issues of interest,” Maduro said. “It seemed to me very important to be able, face to face, discuss issues of maximum interest to Venezuela and the world. And I ratify, as I said to the delegation, all our will to advance in an agenda of well-being and peace through diplomacy, respect and the highest hope for a better world.”

Maduro’s conciliatory remarks would suggest that when oil and money are involved, inconveniences like drug trafficking charges against him shouldn’t get in the way.

Before the weekend visit from Biden officials, Maduro — a Putin ally — was slamming the U.S. and other Western countries for denying Russian banks access to the SWIFT system and banning Russian airlines.

“It’s a crime what they’re doing to the Russian people, an economic war,” he said. “It’s craziness what they’re doing.”

Maduro’s conciliatory remarks would suggest that when oil and money are involved, inconveniences like drug trafficking charges against him shouldn’t get in the way. Venezuela’s president might need a new ally. Why not a country that wants lower gas prices?

This new uneasy relationship between Biden and Maduro has already turned partisan and political, giving Republicans — particularly 2024 presidential hopefuls from Florida, where there is a significant Venezuelan population of voters — an effective talking point.

“It is wrong for the Biden administration to beg for oil from Venezuela and legitimize Maduro’s communist regime during an official visit,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis noted via Twitter. “The U.S. should hold Maduro accountable while increasing domestic energy production so we won’t need to rely on hostile regimes for energy. In the end, a consequence of the Russian invasion could lead to another unlikely pairing. It won’t be the first time the United States has down business with leaders they would rather want removed.”

This is what a war does to policy. It completely flips it. Before the Bolivarian Revolution of Hugo Chávez, U.S. interventionism was the standard and oil was the bounty. Now the U.S. has more or less glossed over the fine print and complexities of its history with Venezuela, because oil is oil.

The Biden administration is not fooling anyone; the condemnations and sanctions against Maduro and Venezuela are just mere symbols. In his view, “Putin’s price hike” needs to be stopped, even if it means doing business with a leader the U.S. still doesn’t even formally recognize.

But Biden is playing a dangerous political game. A short-term fix with Venezuela might lower gas prices but it also exposes America’s self-interest. And it will give Republicans the easy fodder to prove that the Biden administration is just as “socialist” as Maduro.

Back in 2020, the Biden administration had a golden opportunity to radically alter how to deal with Venezuela. It could have called for real democratic measures. It could have stopped deportations of Venezuelans. It could have recognized Maduro as president. Instead, it kept the course on promoting an opposition that has yielded only symbolic pockets of political power while the country suffers.

It’s no wonder that even countries like Colombia, whose current president is staunchly anti-Maduro, said this week that the only way to change Venezuela is through elections.

Imagine if the Biden administration had taken that stance in 2020 instead of sticking to the Trump hard-line stand. Such a play for more oil during a war wouldn’t appear so painfully obvious today.",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-set-trap-venezuela-biden-just-stepped-it-n1291486
