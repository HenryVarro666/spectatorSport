Presidential aide Andriy Sybiha also shared the image on Facebook, writing, “Boris Johnson’s visit in Kyiv began just now with a tete-a-tete meeting with President Zelensky.”

The meeting was planned in utmost secrecy, with the UK’s premier reported to have flown to Poland and travelled overnight by train to Kyiv.

The pair are known to have been in regular contact since the Russian invasion of Ukraine six weeks ago. President Zelensky addressed the UK’s political chamber of the Houses of Commons in London a few days after war broke out.

The visit, seen as a potent sign of solidarity, comes on the same day as the discovery of 132 civilians found shot dead in Ukraine, and following Zelensky’s accusing Russia’s leader Vladimir Putin of war crimes.",https://deadline.com/2022/04/boris-johnson-meeting-ukraine-president-zelensky-surprise-visit-kyiv-1234997808/

Mr Johnson went on a walkabout in the capital, meeting and shaking hands with ordinary Ukrainians, alongside the country’s President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Footage of the Prime Minister’s surprise visit was released alongside details of the new package of financial and military aid which includes 120 armoured vehicles and new anti-ship missile systems.

His presence in the capital was announced when a photo, captioned “surprise”, was shared on social media by the Ukrainian embassy in this country showed the men meeting in the recently besieged city.

Speaking after the meeting, Mr Johnson said: “Ukraine has defied the odds and pushed back Russian forces from the gates of Kyiv, achieving the greatest feat of arms of the 21st century.

“It is because of President Zelensky’s resolute leadership and the invincible heroism and courage of the Ukrainian people that Putin’s monstrous aims are being thwarted.

“I made clear today that the United Kingdom stands unwaveringly with them in this ongoing fight, and we are in it for the long run.

“We are stepping up our own military and economic support and convening a global alliance to bring this tragedy to an end, and ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation.”

The announcements follow an urgent appeal by the Ukrainians for more weapons – including armoured vehicles – ahead of an expected Russian offensive on the eastern Donbas region, already part held by pro-Moscow separatists.

The inclusion of anti-ship missile systems came as British military intelligence said Russian naval forces were continuing to launch cruise missile strikes in support of ground operations in the region.

There were no immediate details of the armoured vehicles, although Defence Secretary Ben Wallace indicated during a visit to Romania on Friday they would be Mastiff six-wheel-drive patrol vehicles.

Appearing alongside Mr Zelensky in a recorded broadcast clip, Mr Johnson said the West would continue to “ratchet up” sanctions on Moscow as he praised the courage of the Ukrainian resistance.

“I think that the Ukrainians have shown the courage of a lion, and you Volodymyr have given the roar of that lion,” he said.

“The UK and others (will) supply the equipment, the technology, the know-how, the intelligence, so that Ukraine will never be invaded again.

“So Ukraine is so fortified and protected – that Ukraine can never be bullied again. Never be blackmailed again. Never be threatened in the same way again.”

President Zelensky later posted on Facebook: “The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson is one of the most principled opponents of the Russian invasion, a leader in sanctions pressure on Russia and defense support of Ukraine. Welcome to Kyiv my friend!”

Downing Street said the PM’s visit was a “show of solidarity” with Ukraine.

Mr Johnson tweeted yesterday the UK would send “more defensive weapons to Ukraine” and target Russia’s economy “to ensure Putin fails”.

The further £100 million worth of UK military assistance includes anti-tank and anti-aircraft weaponry and so-called “suicide drones”, which hang over the battlefield before attacking their target.

Earlier in the week, the UK and Nato allies agreed to supply “new and heavier” weapons to Ukraine as Kyiv warned it needs immediate reinforcement in its struggle against Russia

Nato allies fear Russia’s decision to withdraw from areas around Kyiv will allow Mr Putin to concentrate his offensive in Ukraine’s east.

Ukrainian generals have visited the UK to see some of the kit that could potentially be offered, including armoured vehicles which could offer troops protection from Russian attack as they move around the war zone.

The UK is already supplying equipment including anti-tank and anti-air missiles to Ukraine’s armed forces.

Civilian evacuations have gone ahead in parts of eastern Ukraine after a missile strike killed at least 52 people at a train station where thousands were waiting to leave the region before an expected Russian onslaught.

President Zelensky said the attack in Kramatorsk was the latest sign of war crimes by Russian forces and urged the West to help his country.

Russia denied it was responsible and accused Ukraine’s military of firing on the station to try to turn blame for civilian death on Moscow.

The mayor of Bucha, a town near Kyiv where graphic evidence of civilian killings emerged after the Russians withdrew, said search teams were still finding the bodies of people shot at close range in yards, parks and city squares.",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/pm-boris-johnson-ukrainian-president-zelensky-kyiv-b993479.html

""Together with our partners we're going to ratchet up the economic pressure, and we will continue to intensify week by week the sanctions on Russia,"" Johnson said. He also promised help with defense systems, including demining the country.

Johnson said he'd seen much of the ""beautiful"" country of Ukraine during his visit. ""I've also seen the tragic effects of the war — an inexcusable war — an absolutely inexcusable and unnecessary war,"" he said.

""But having been here in Kyiv for just a few hours... I have no doubt at all that an independent, sovereign Ukraine will rise again, thanks, above all, to the heroism, the courage, of the people of Ukraine,"" he said.
