Arakhamia made the announcement on social media.

Ukraine described previous talks with Russia, launched after Russia unleashed an invasion last month, as ""very difficult.""

Ankara hosted the foreign ministers of Russia and Ukraine in Antalya earlier this month. Foreign Ministers Sergey Lavrov of Russia and Dmytro Kuleba of Ukraine met for talks in the Turkish resort town of Antalya, which Çavuşoğlu also attended. The talks were largely inconclusive, but Ankara considers the fact that they took place at all a success.

Maintaining its neutral and balanced stance, Turkey continues its diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the Ukraine conflict, urging all sides to exercise restraint. While Ankara has opposed international sanctions designed to isolate Moscow, it also closed its straits to prevent some Russian vessels from crossing through them.

NATO ally Turkey borders Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea and has good ties with both. Since the beginning of the conflict, Ankara has offered to mediate between the two sides and host peace talks, underlining its support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty. Having recently called Russia’s invasion an unacceptable violation of international law, Turkey has carefully formulated its rhetoric not to offend Moscow, with which it has close energy, defense and tourism ties.

While forging close ties with Russia on energy, defense and trade, and relying heavily on Russian tourists, Turkey has sold drones to Ukraine, which angered Moscow. Turkey also opposes Russian policies in Syria and Libya, as well as Moscow's annexation of Crimea. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has repeatedly said Turkey will not abandon its relations with Russia or Ukraine, underlining that Ankara's ability to speak to both sides is an asset.",https://www.dailysabah.com/politics/diplomacy/turkey-to-host-next-round-of-russia-ukraine-negotiation-talks

The next round of face to face talks between Ukraine and Russia will take place in Turkey on March 28-30, Ukrainian negotiator David Arakhamia said on social media on Sunday.

Ukraine described previous talks with Russia, launched after Russia unleashed an invasion last month, as “very difficult.”

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Friday peace negotiations with Russia were difficult, and denied reports that progress had been made in resolving four out of six key issues.

Ukraine said that a second round of conflict talks between negotiators from Kyiv and Moscow will take place in Turkey from Monday, just over one month into Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""Today, during another round of video negotiations, it was decided to hold the next in-person round of the two delegations in Turkey on March 28-30,"" David Arakhamia, a Ukraine negotiator and politician wrote on Facebook.

Russia's lead negotiator in the conflict, Vladimir Medinsky, confirmed the upcoming talks with Ukraine, but gave a slightly different time frame, saying they would start Tuesday and end Wednesday.

Russia and Ukraine failed to make a breakthrough in their first top-level talks, on March 10 in Antalya, since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine in late February.

The two sides have held regular talks via video conference but offered scant hopes for any breakthroughs with both sides describing efforts as difficult.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erodgan said this week that Russia and Ukraine appeared to have reached an understanding on four out of six negotiating points; Ukraine staying out of NATO, the use of Russian language in Ukraine, disarmament and security guarantees.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Friday however that there was ""no consensus"" on key points with Russia.

06:14 am: Trump asks Putin to help dish dirt on Hunter Biden

Donald Trump has called on Russian President Vladimir Putin, who launched an invasion of Ukraine last month, to reveal any compromising information he might have on US President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter.

The former Republican president returned to accusations he had repeated many times during his unsuccessful campaign against Biden in the 2020 presidential election.

In an interview excerpt broadcast Tuesday by Real America’s Voice “Just the News” show, Trump claimed that the wife of the mayor of Moscow gave $3.5 million to Hunter Biden.

“That’s a lot of money,” he said. “She gave him $3.5 million so now I would think Putin would know the answer to that. I think he should release it.”

Trump has long claimed, without providing evidence, that the younger Biden received the funds from Elena Baturina, wife of the late Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov, in a bid to curry favor with Joe Biden.

04:55 am: US State Department warns that Moscow may ‘detain’ Americans in Russia

The US State Department issued a travel advisory on Tuesday warning that Moscow “may single out and detain US citizens in Russia” and repeating earlier warnings for Americans not to travel to the country.

The warning was “due to the unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine by Russian military forces” as well as the potential for harassment of US citizens by Russian authorities, the travel advisory said, repeating calls for Americans travelling or living in Russia to leave “immediately”.

03:57 am: Death toll in Mykolaiv strike rises to 12

At least 12 people were killed and 33 wounded on Tuesday when a Russian missile hit a regional government building in the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv, emergency officials said.

“The bodies of 12 people have been recovered from the site of the destruction and 33 people have been injured,” Ukraine’s emergencies agency said in a statement on Telegram.

Photos posted by the agency showed rescue workers clearing the rubble and a female medical worker in a red suit helping an injured man lying on a stretcher, his face bloodied.

Earlier in the day officials spoke of nine people being killed and 28 injured in the strike, which hit the nine-storey building shortly before 9 am local time, destroying the entire central part of the structure.

After a lull in the fighting that lasted several days, the attack on Tuesday morning surprised this city, which is home to half a million people in peacetime. Mykolaiv stands on the road to Odesa, Ukraine’s largest port in the south.

The front line in the region has recently shifted southeast to Mykolaiv, which is located near Kherson, the only major Ukrainian city that Russia claims to have taken under full control since the war started over a month ago.

03:06 am: With Ukraine farmers on frontlines, UN food chief warns of ‘devastation’

The UN food chief warned on Tuesday that the war in Ukraine was threatening to devastate the World Food Programme’s efforts to feed some 125 million people globally because Ukraine had gone “from the breadbasket of the world to breadlines.”

“It’s not just decimating dynamically Ukraine and the region, but it will have global context impact beyond anything we’ve seen since World War Two,” WFP Executive Director David Beasley told the 15-member United Nations Security Council.

Beasley said 50 percent of the grain bought by the WFP, the food-assistance branch of the United Nations, comes from Ukraine, “so you can only assume the devastation that this is going to have on our operations alone.”

“The farmers are on the frontlines,” he said.

Beasley added that the crisis was compounded by a lack of fertilizer products coming from Belarus and Russia.

“If you don’t put fertilizer on the crops, your yield will be at least 50% diminished. So we’re looking at what could be a catastrophe on top of a catastrophe in the months ahead,” he told the council.

02:48 am: Ukrainian military remains wary of Russian promises

The general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said Tuesday evening that Russia’s promise to curtail military operations in some areas was “probably a rotation of individual units and aims to mislead.”

01:14 am: Thousands of civilians may have died in Mariupol in past month, UN says

Thousands of civilians may have died in the besieged port city of Mariupol in southern Ukraine since bombing began four weeks ago, the head of the UN human rights mission told Reuters on Tuesday, providing its first estimate.

Nearly 5,000 people, including about 210 children, have been killed in Mariupol since Russian forces laid siege to it a month ago, a spokesperson for Mayor Vadym Boichenko said on Monday.

His office said 90% of Mariupol’s buildings had been damaged and 40% destroyed, including hospitals, schools, kindergartens and factories.

“We do think that there could be thousands of deaths, of civilian casualties, in Mariupol,” Matilda Bogner, head of the UN human rights mission in Ukraine which deploys some 60 monitors, said in a virtual interview.

She said the mission did not have a precise estimate but was working to gather more information.

Local officials, citing witness accounts, last week estimated that 300 people were killed in the March 16 bombing of a Mariupol theatre where people were sheltering.

As of Tuesday, the UN human rights office had confirmed 1,179 civilians killed and 1,860 injured across Ukraine in the five-week old conflict, amid reporting delays due to the hostilities, a statement said.

March 30, 00:36 am: Western diplomats accuse Russia of fuelling global food crisis

Western diplomats accused Russia before the UN Security Council on Tuesday of having caused a “global food crisis” and putting people at risk of “famine” by starting the war in Ukraine, which serves as a breadbasket for Europe.

Russian President Vladimir Putin “started this war. Vladimir Putin created this global food crisis. And he is the one who can stop it,” US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said during a Security Council meeting devoted to the humanitarian situation in Ukraine.

France’s ambassador to the UN, Nicolas de Riviere, furthered that “Russia’s aggression against Ukraine is increasing the risk of famine around the world” and that populations in developing countries would be the first to be affected.

“Russia will no doubt try to make us believe that it is the sanctions adopted against it that are creating an imbalance in the world security situation for food,” de Riviere added.

Moscow’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia indeed countered that potential turbulence in the global food market was in fact caused by “the unbridled sanctions hysteria that the West has unleashed against Russia.”

Sherman and the director of the World Food Program (WFP), David Beasley, reported that Ukraine and Russia, which are both major cereal producers, represent 30 percent of world wheat exports, 20 percent for corn and 75 percent for sunflower oil.

10:06 pm: Ukraine's Zelensky calls Russia talks 'positive' but wants to see results

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said there were ""positive"" signals from peace talks with Russia on Tuesday but that there could be no talk of lifting sanctions until the war ends.

""We can say that the signals we hear from the negotiations are positive, but those signals do not drown out the explosions or Russian shells,"" Zelensky said in a video address late Tuesday.

Zelensky also expressed skepticism about Moscow's stated plan of a military de-escalation, saying: ""We will not decrease our defense efforts"". He added that there could be no talk of lifting Russia sanctions until the war ends.

""We're seeing a small number now that appears to be moving away from Kyiv, this on the same day that the Russians say they're withdrawing,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said.

""But we're not prepared to call this a retreat or even a withdrawal,"" he said. ""We think that what they probably have in mind is a repositioning to prioritize elsewhere.""

""We all should be prepared to watch for a major offensive against other areas of Ukraine,"" Kirby said. ""It does not mean that the threat to Kyiv is over.

""Russia has failed in its objective of capturing Kiev,"" the Pentagon spokesman said, but ""they can still inflict massive brutality on the country including on Kyiv"".

7:37 pm: Biden, European allies agree to 'continue raising costs on Russia' over Ukraine

US President Joe Biden on Tuesday said it remains to be seen whether Russia follows through with any actions to scale down its military operations in Ukraine, saying Washington and its allies will continue with strong sanctions and aid for Ukraine.

""We'll see if they follow through with what they're suggesting"" as Moscow-Kyiv negotiations continue, he told reporters at the White House following his meeting with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore.

""We're going to continue to keep a close eye on what's going on.""

4:15 am: Oscars ceremony holds moment of silence for Ukraine

Hollywood A-listers held a moment of silence at Sunday’s Oscars gala to show support for the people of Ukraine in the face of Russia’s invasion, after much speculation about how Tinseltown would handle the issue.

Many were calling on Oscars organisers to do something to acknowledge the situation, but others feared the moment could be perceived as too preachy.

A series of slides appeared on the giant screen at the Dolby Theatre.

“We’d like to have a moment of silence to show our support for the people of Ukraine currently facing invasion, conflict and prejudice within their own borders,” the first one read.

“While film is an important avenue for us to express our humanity in times of conflict, the reality is millions of families in Ukraine need food, medical care, clean water and emergency services. Resources are scarce and we – collectively as a global community – can do more,” the next one read.

“We ask you to support Ukraine in any way you are able #StandWithUkraine”.

03:20 am: Ukraine says Russian forces near Chernobyl could pose new radiation threat

A senior Ukrainian official accused Russia on Sunday of “irresponsible” acts around the occupied Chernobyl power station that could send radiation across much of Europe, and urged the United Nations to dispatch a mission to assess the risks.

Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on Telegram that Russian forces were “militarising” the exclusion zone around the station, site of the world’s worst civil nuclear accident in 1986.

Russian forces, she said, were transporting large amounts of old and badly maintained weapons, creating a risk of damaging the containment vessel constructed around the station’s wrecked fourth reactor. She added that Russian forces were preventing firefighters from bringing under control large numbers of fires in the zone.

00:30 am: Germany considers buying Israeli anti-missile shield

Germany is looking at buying an Israeli anti-missile shield system that could also offer protective cover for neighbouring EU states, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Sunday.

“I can reveal to you that that is certainly among the things that we are discussing, and for good reasons,” Scholz told state television channel ARD.

The chancellor’s comments confirmed earlier statements from German parliamentary sources earlier Sunday.

“We must better protect ourselves against the Russian threat,” Andreas Schwarz of the SPD, who sits on the parliamentary budget committee, told Bild daily.

“To do that, we need quickly an anti-missile shield for Germany. The Israeli Arrow 3 system is a good solution,” he added, referring to the long-range missile deterrence weapon.

According to Bild, the system, which costs two billion euros ($2.2 billion), could be operational from 2025.

March 28, 00:22 am: NATO not seeking regime change in Russia, Scholz says

Regime change in Russia is not NATO’s objective, despite Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Sunday, a day after US President Joe Biden branded Vladimir Putin a “butcher” who “cannot remain in power”.

It “is not the objective of NATO, nor that of the US president”, Scholz told German state television channel ARD.

“I’ve had the chance to talk at length with him at the White House and we have also discussed these questions,” he added.

The White House moved quickly Saturday to play down Biden’s comments during an impassioned speech in Warsaw.

Scholz’s comments follow remarks earlier Sunday by French President Emmanuel Macron, in which he warned against verbal “escalation” with Putin.

9:45 pm: Zelensky says Russian businessmen offered Ukraine support

Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday that Ukraine had received offers of support from Russian businessmen and that Kyiv would give refuge to anyone who backed his country's fight against Moscow.

During an interview with Russian journalists Zelensky said he had received signals of support from Russian businessmen, including Roman Abramovich.

The Ukrainian leader said the businessmen had told him they wanted to ""do something"" and ""help somehow"" to de-escalate Russia's now month-long military assault on Ukraine. ""Some said that they were ready to help rebuild the country after the war,"" Zelensky said during the interview conducted by journalists from several independent Russian media.

9:14 pm: Zelensky says Ukraine seriously considering Russian demand of neutrality

Ukraine is prepared to discuss adopting a neutral status as part of a peace deal with Russia but such a pact would have to be guaranteed by third parties and put to a referendum, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in remarks aired on Sunday.

Zelensky was speaking to Russian journalists in a 90-minute video call, an interview that Moscow authorities had pre-emptively warned Russian media to refrain from reporting. Zelensky spoke in Russian throughout, as he has done in previous speeches when targeting a Russian audience.

Zelensky said Russia’s invasion had caused the destruction of Russian-speaking cities in Ukraine, and said the damage was worse than the Russian wars in Chechnya.

“Security guarantees and neutrality, non-nuclear status of our state. We are ready to go for it. This is the most important point,” Zelensky said.

00:15

Zelensky said Ukraine refused to discuss certain other Russian demands, such as the demilitarisation of the country, and said no peace deal would be possible without a ceasefire and troop withdrawals.

He ruled out trying to recapture all Russian-held territory by force, saying it would lead to a third world war, and said he wanted to reach a “compromise” over the eastern Donbas region, held by Russian-backed forces since 2014.

8:10 pm: Erdogan stresses need for ceasefire in call with Putin

8:02 pm: Russia restricts access to Germany's Bild website

Russia said it had restricted access to the website of Germany's Bild at the request of prosecutors, a step the Berlin-based tabloid said underscored the integrity of its reporting on the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

""The blocking of Bild.de by the Russian censors confirms us in our journalistic work for democracy, freedom and human rights,"" Bild editor-in-chief Johannes Boie said on its website.

""And it encourages us to give Russian citizens even more opportunities to inform themselves with news and facts beyond Russian government propaganda.""

7:35 pm: Ukraine warns of escalation in fighting around Mariupol

Ukraine warned of a possible escalation in fighting around the besieged southern port city of Mariupol after Moscow said it was focusing its military resources on capturing the eastern Donbas region.

""This means a potential or sharp deterioration around Mariupol,"" an adviser to the head of the President's office, Oleksiy Arestovich, said in a video statement.

6:56 pm: Separatist leaders have 'no democratic backing'

Russian forces are currently ""carrying out aggressive operations in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions mainly, with the stated aim of taking those regions by force,"" FRANCE 24's Gulliver Cragg reported from Kyiv.

""So the idea that the so-called separatist leaders there who were put in place by Russia in 2014 have no democratic backing there [...] could somehow organise referendums and expect people to think that the residents of those regions who have been subject to Russian bombardment and have been hiding in their basements, have been short of food, and have in many cases been forced to flee their homes or the country -- that they would vote to join Russia in a referendum is something that people in the international community would never even think about recognising"", Cragg said.

5:51 pm: France says world powers must 'keep talking' to Putin

International powers must keep talking with Russia's President Vladimir Putin until he is ready to end his invasion of Ukraine, France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Sunday.

Le Drian told a conference in Doha that Putin had not achieved any of his aims, but that there had to be a ceasefire around the bombarded Ukrainian city of Mariupol before there could be negotiations.

Asked about French President Emmanuel Macron's plan to speak with Putin this week about a ceasefire, Le Drian told the Doha Forum: ""We must keep talking with the Russians, we must continue to speak with President Putin precisely because he has not had the results he thought he would.""

5:10 pm: France's Le Drian warns of 'collective guilt' if Mariupol civilians not helped

The French foreign minister said there would be ""collective guilt"" if nothing was done to help civilians in Mariupol, the Ukrainian city besieged by Russian forces.

""Mariupol is a striking example of a military siege, and military sieges are horrible wars because civil populations are massacred, annihilated. The suffering is terrible,"" Jean-Yves Le Drian told the Doha Forum international conference.

""This is why there needs to be at least one moment when the civilian population can breathe,"" he said, adding that this was what French President Emmanuel Macron was working to secure.

4:49 pm: Kyiv says Russia could divide Ukraine like Korea

Ukraine said that Russia, whose troops have been slowly advancing towards the capital Kyiv, may aim to divide the country in two, just like North and South Korea.

Kyrylo Budanov, Chief of the Defence Intelligence, said in a statement on social media that the strategy could result from President Vladimir Putin's failure to ""capture Kyiv and remove Ukraine's government"".

""There are reasons to believe that he may try to impose a separation line between the occupied and unoccupied regions of our country. In fact, it will be an attempt to set up South and North Koreas in Ukraine,"" Budanov said.

The true casualty figures are expected to be considerably higher, the world body said, with reports delayed in some regions where intense hostilities are going on, while many reports still require corroboration.

4:05 pm: Red Cross denies it conducted forced evacuations of Ukrainians to Russia

The International Committee of the Red Cross has denied accusations that it helped organise or carry out forced evacuations of Ukrainians to Russia.

""The ICRC does not ever help organize or carry out forced evacuations. This applies everywhere we work. We would not support any operation that would go against people's will and our principles,"" the Geneva-based humanitarian organisation said in a statement published late Saturday.

The statement appears to be a response to accusations by Roman Rukomeda, a Ukrainian political analyst who spoke to the Euractiv online media on Saturday. Rukomeda said ""there is evidence of strange behaviour by the International Committee of the Red Cross and its head, who announced the decision to open an office in Russian Rostov to assist Russian terrorists in the illegal deportation of Ukrainian citizens"".

Around 90 percent of them are women and children, it added. Of those who have left, 2.2 million have fled for neighbouring Poland, while more than half a million have made it to Romania.

3:21 pm: 'Pressure in Kyiv has eased'

""I think the pressure in Kyiv has eased,"" FRANCE 24's Gulliver Cragg reports from the Ukrainian capital.

""We can't in any way talk about normal life returning. Kyiv is very highly militarised; there are checkpoints everywhere, soldiers everywhere. I was just asked by the police, for example, to turn my camera around so that no residential buildings could be seen in the shot when I was doing my live. There is still tension. But there's a growing confidence that this city will not be taken; that the Russians will just not be able to take Kyiv, that the armed forces have fought off Russian advances in satellite towns around Kyiv.""

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called for a global boycott of French retail giant Auchan, with pressure mounting on international brands to quit Russia over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine has asked the International Committee of the Red Cross not to open a planned office in Russia's Rostov-on-Don, saying it would legitimise Moscow's so-called ""humanitarian corridors"" and the abduction and forced deportation of Ukrainians.

The head of the ICRC said on Thursday after his talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov that agreement between the Russian and Ukrainian armies was needed before civilians could be evacuated properly from war-torn Ukraine.

""The Committee calls on the International Committee of the Red Cross that it would not legitimise 'humanitarian corridors' on the territory of the Russian Federation as well as that it would not support the abduction of Ukrainians and its forced deportation,"" Radutskyi said in a statement.

Rostov-on-Don is the largest Russian city on Ukraine's eastern border and administrative capital of the Rostov region, and it has been used by Russia for temporary accommodation camps for people transported out of the war zone.

Vladimir Medinsky, Russia's chief negotiator, stated that the next round of discussions will take place in Turkey. He did say, though, that the talks will begin on Tuesday (March 29) and finish on Wednesday (March 30).

According to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the two former Soviet neighbours have reached an agreement on four of the six negotiation points: Ukraine's refusal to pursue NATO membership, the use of the Russian language in Ukraine, disarmament, and security assurances. Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister, claimed there was ""no consensus"" with Russia on important issues.

This comes as Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has accused the West of timidity and a lack of confidence in dealing with Russia.

""If only those who have been thinking for 31 days on how to hand over dozens of jets and tanks had 1% of their courage,"" Zelenskyy said.

Zelenskyy has been pleading with the West to give Ukraine fighter planes and tanks on a regular basis.

Alluding to the besieged city of Mariupol, which has been the target of Russian missiles, Zelenskyy said the ""determination, heroism, and firmness"" of the ""defenders"" are ""astonishing,"" despite repeated attempts for a humanitarian corridor for the city failing due to blame-shifting between the two countries.

Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine began about a month ago, an estimated 6.5 million people have been displaced within the nation, while another 3.2 million have fled owing to safety concerns.
