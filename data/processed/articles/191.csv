Earlier, American officials had assessed that the Iskander-M will be a key weapon system that Russia would use to “destroy vital objects” during its military operation against Ukraine.

According to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, a total of 36 Iskander launchers were deployed by the Russian armed forces close to the border and Ukraine’s capital Kyiv. Key Ukrainian military installations were within the strike range of these missiles.

Now, US intelligence officials have learned that the ballistic missiles fired by Russia into Ukraine have decoys that can evade air-defense radars and trick heat-seeking missiles.

“Each is packed with electronics and produces radio signals to jam or spoof enemy radars attempting to locate the Iskander-M, and contains a heat source to attract incoming missiles,” a US official told NYT.

These dart-shaped white-colored decoys are about a foot long each, with an orange tail. American sleuths are of the view that the Iskander-Ms fired from mobile launchers across the border release these decoys when they sense that they have been targeted by the Ukrainian air defenses.

Powered by a solid-fuel rocket motor, Iskander is capable of reaching targets as far as 500 km away with a circular error probability (CEP) of 5-7 meters, which means half of the projectiles fired will land in a circle with a radius of that size.

According to the US-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), the Iskander projectiles are designed in such a way that they can confuse missile defenses by flying on a low trajectory and maneuvering their flight.

Each mobile launcher can fire two Iskanders before it must be reloaded and has an armored cover for the missiles, and its cabin is hardened against chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear hazards, as well as extreme temperatures.

Reports suggest that as of March 1, Russia had fired about 320 missiles into Ukraine, the majority being Iskander SRBMs.

“Russia most likely used its only SRBM in active service, the Iskander-M”, said Timothy Wright, a research analyst with the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).

What the missiles targeted and how much damage they caused remains unclear amid the confusion of the developing war, but according to reports, Iskanders were used to attack Ukrainian airbases.

Ukrainian Airbase Destroyed

Iskander missiles launched from Belarus had successfully hit an airport in Zhytomyr in northern Ukraine on March 13, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister said.

“We see some damage at airports, and it looks fairly accurate,” said Jeffrey Lewis, a missile researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS).

The use of decoys may have been the reason behind why the Ukrainian air-defense weapons have been unable to intercept Russia’s Iskander missiles.

Images of the dart-shaped munitions started circulating on social media two weeks ago. At the time, experts and open-source intelligence (OSINT) analysts had thought that these were bomblets from cluster weapons, based on their size and shape.

Richard Stevens, a British Army veteran who served 22 years as an explosive ordnance disposal soldier, and later worked as a civilian bomb technician for 10 years in southern Iraq, Africa and other regions, said he had been exposed “to plenty of Chinese and Russian munitions, but I had never seen this”.

He posted photos of the munitions to a site for military and civilian bomb disposal experts that he started in 2011, and found that nobody else seemed to have seen these munitions before either.

The US intelligence officials told NYT that these devices are similar to Cold War-era decoys called “penetration aids” that have accompanied nuclear warheads since the 1970s and were designed to evade anti-missile systems so as to allow individual warheads to reach their targets.

However, the use of decoys on missiles like Iskander-M that have conventional warheads has not been previously documented by military experts.

According to Jeffrey Lewis, these decoys are not easily seen because they are highly secret and it is highly unlikely that the version of the Iskander that Russia has sold to other countries would contain these decoys.

“Russia knows they will inevitably be collected and studied by Western intelligence services so that NATO air defenses can be programmed to defeat the Iskander’s countermeasures,” Lewis said.

“That suggests to me that the Russians place some value on keeping that technology close to home and that this war is important enough to them to give that up,” Lewis added. “They’re digging deep, and maybe they no longer care, but I would care if I were them.”",https://eurasiantimes.com/russias-radar-evading-missile-us-as-nuclear-iskande/

From the first days of its independent development, Ukraine affirmed three basic principles -- not to accept, manufacture, or acquire nuclear weapons. The West remained concerned with the nuclear aspects of Ukraine's problems with weapons proliferation. Western sensitivity over nuclear issues convinced Ukraine's leaders that they could influence the West by using the nuclear lever.

The Declaration of State Sovereignty adopted by the Parliament of the Ukrainian SSR on July 16, 1990 defined the building of the army as a major task and a natural right of the future independent Ukrainian state. By announcing the right to maintain its own army, Ukraine took a significant step toward independence from the USSR. The military coup in Moscow in August 1991, combined with fears that Soviet troops in Ukrainian territory would act aggressively against the Ukrainian state, led the official leadership in Kiev to subordinate these troops to the control of Ukrainian authorities.

Ukraine also announced as its own the Soviet military property on the soil of the newly independent state. Ukraine initially announced its intention to obtain operational control over the strategic nuclear weapons deployed in its territory. Responding to these intentions, Russian military officials responded that attempts to interfere with, or to damage the command and control systems of, Russian strategic troops located abroad would constitute a direct military threat to the Russian Federation.

Originally Ukrainian leader Leonid Kravchuk was ""not worried"" if nuclear weapons were sent to Russia for decommissioning. Gradually, however, his worries developed sufficiently to lead to him to reverse his position and on March 12, 1992 to suspend temporarily the transfer of tactical nuclear weapons to Russia. However, in conformity with the July 16, 1990 Declaration of State Sovereignty and other agreements signed at the creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), by May 1992 Ukraine voluntarily removed all tactical nuclear weapons (approximately 3,000) inherited from the former Soviet Union.

The trilateral agreement signed in Moscow on January 14, 1994 by the United States, Russia, and Ukraine was seen as a significant Western success in disarming Ukraine of nuclear weapons. Under the agreement, the Russian Federation sent 100 tons of fuel to Ukraine for its nuclear power plants. The United States agreed to pay $60 million to the Russian Federation in support of that process. For its part, Ukraine agreed to transfer 200 nuclear warheads over a 10-month period. Ukraine joined the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) as a non-nuclear weapon state in 1994. Ukraine signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) on February 23, 2001. With Ukraine’s signing of the CTBT, Eastern Europe became the first of the Treaty’s six geographical regions to fully meet the Treaty’s conditions to into effect.

As of May 1994, 120 SS-19 Stiletto and 60 SS-24 Scalpel ICBMs had been shipped out of Ukraine for reprocessing in Russia.

Ukraine announced in June 1996 that all warheads had been removed from the country. A problem arose in the removal of SS-19s, which use large amounts of a toxic substance known as heptyl. The United States sent storage tanks to hold 2,200 metric tons of the substance. After the SS-19 missiles were removed from combat duty, 19 were re-used in Russia.

In May 1997 Ukraine agreed to destroy its SS-24 missiles, in addition to SS-19 missiles, silos and launch sites, utilizing $47 million provided through the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. Withdrawal from combat duty of the SS-24 (RS-22) missiles started on July 1, 1998. Complete liquidation of ICBMs in Ukraine is planned to be completed by January 4, 2001. In September 1998 a US Department of Defense delegation, headed by Assistant Secretary of Defense Edward Warner, took part in the decommissioning of a SS-24 silo launcher in Pervomaisk, the Nikolayev region, Ukraine. The Pervomaisk base comprises 46 silos with SS-24 solid-fuel ICBMs. Decommissioning of a single silo launcher was estimated to cost about US $1 million, and the US Government allocated a total of US $399.2 million. The Bechtel Corporation was the main contractor in the decommissioning program of the Ukrainian silo launchers.

Ukraine inherited about 30 percent of the Soviet military industry, which included between 50 and 60 percent of all Ukrainian enterprises, employing 40 percent of its working population. Ukraine was, and remains, the leader in missile-related technology, especially guidance systems, navigation electronics for combat vessels and submarines, and radar for military jets. Strong competition in the world's weapons market forced Ukraine to look into exporting arms to politically unstable or even aggressive regimes. Ukraine established its own network for arms export and, in so doing, did not fully recognize international rules and bans. The Ukrainian military traded conventional arms on the black market and signed contracts with commercial firms. The first contracts on weapons deliveries to Iran, signed in the middle of 1992, and caused negative reaction in the West (particularly in the US).

On May 13, 1994, the United States and Ukraine signed a Memorandum of Understanding on the Transfer of Missile Equipment and Technology. This agreement committed Ukraine to adhere to the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) by controlling exports of missile-related equipment and technology according to the MTCR Guidelines. Ukraine has also signed the Hague Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation, which was established in 2002.

The 11 strategic bombers and 600 air-launched missiles exchanged by Ukraine to Russia in payment for the gas debt were transferred in mid-February 2000 (all of which had their nuclear weapons removed by 1996). Two Tu-160 bombers flew from Priluki in the Ukrainian Chernigov region for the Russian air base in Engels. The missiles were sent to Russia by railroad. Three Tu-95MS bombers and six Tu-160 airplanes had already arrived at Engels since October 1999 in fulfillment of the intergovernmental agreements. Before being moved to Russia, 19 Tu-160 airplanes were stationed at the Priluki airfield and 21 Tu-95MS were located in Uzin.

Russian Strategic Missile Forces will start replacing Voyevoda intercontinental ballistic missiles currently in service with the new Sarmat missiles this year.

Sarmat: Russia's heaviest nuke

A few years ago Russian President Vladimir Putin had boasted of developing a number of ""invincible"" weapons that can surpass existing systems, including the Sarmat intercontinental missiles and Burevestnik cruise missiles.

In recent years the Kremlin strongman has scored a number of battlefields -- and foreign policy -- triumphs that helped boost his popularity despite economic malaise at home. In 2015, Russia charged into Syria with an air campaign that turned the tide of a complex conflict in favour of the Damascus regime.

A year earlier, Russian special forces helped the Kremlin seize Crimea from Ukraine in a largely bloodless military operation. As Putin's regime gets set to meet NATO's challenge in Europe, the Russian defence ministry has already prepared its ICBM strategy fine-tuning it for display in the future.
