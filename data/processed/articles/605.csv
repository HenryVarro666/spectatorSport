Since the Russian invasion began on 24 February, Ukraine has been promised a plethora of infantry anti-tank weapons. More than half a dozen Western nations have pledged to send anti-tank weapons specifically, while others have promised other lethal and non-lethal aid.

The transfer of Western anti-armour weapons started before the war even began. The United States transferred significant shipments of Javelin anti-tank guided missiles and M141 SMAW-D Bunker Defeat Munitions while the UK sent some 2,000 Next Generation Light Anti-Tank Weapons (NLAWs). On 20 January, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia announced that they planned to deliver Stinger man-portable surface-to-air missiles and Javelin anti-tank guided missiles to Ukraine. Once Putin’s tanks rolled over the Ukrainian border and the conflict escalated the flood gates opened and Western nations including Finland, Sweden, Spain, Luxembourg and even Germany promised anti-armour weapons.

The weapons promised ranged from the venerable 66mm M72 LAW to the cutting-edge Javelin and almost everything in between. As promises of aid were made the weapons already on the ground reportedly began to find their mark. On the first day of the war the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense announced that NLAWs had knocked out ‘3 enemy tanks’ and numerous videos and photographs of tanks and armored fighting vehicles said to be knocked out by Javelin missiles have surfaced – though these are difficult to verify.

In a report from 3 March, however, a U.S. Special Operations official monitoring the conflict claimed that 280 Russian armored vehicles had been knocked out by the Javelin, out of a total of 300 missiles fired. We have yet to see any footage of Javelin used in Ukraine, this may be down to good Ukrainian operational security protocols.

The transfer of weapons from European nations has been facilitated by the European Union’s historic move to finance and organise the transfer the weapons to a nation at war, a first in its 65-year history. The transfers to Ukraine will be facilitated via the EU’s European Peace Facility (EPF), a 5 billion Euro ($5.6 billion) budget (running from for 2021–27) designed to assist faltering or failed states in Europe’s neighbouring regions. From the EPF budget 450 million Euros will finance the weapon transfers.

What Is Being Sent?

Perhaps the most notable announcement, on 26 February, from Europe was Germany’s announcement that 1,000 Panzerfaust 3 anti-tank weapons (it is unclear if this refers to the reusable firing units or projectiles) and 500 Stinger surface-to-air missiles would be sent to Ukraine. The Panzerfaust 3 is a shoulder-launched weapon with a fire control/launcher unit which can be reused. It is not known what projectiles have been sent with the launcher unit. Some evidence suggests that the Panzerfaust 3s have arrived. There have also been reports that Germany is looking at sending 2,000 former East German 9K32 Strela-2 MANPADS, though the condition of these is said to be poor.

Germany’s u-turn on militarily supporting Ukraine also enabled countries who wished to send German-made weapons to Ukraine. These included 50 Panzerfaust 3 launchers and 400 projectiles which the Netherlands confirmed they would dispatch along with 200 Stinger MANPADS. It also feed up the Soviet-era, East German-built D-30 howitzers Finland had hoped to send in January.

Denmark committed to donate 2,700 shoulder launched anti-tank weapons. It was confirmed on 27 February, that the anti-tank weapons would “come from the Armed Forces’ operational stock,” and that “the Chief of Defense has assessed that it is justifiable for the Danish defense to do without these weapons in the current acute situation.” The weapons have been confirmed as the single-use, shoulder-fired 66mm M72 ECLAW (Enhanced Capability Light Antitank Weapon). The Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs shared a video on 2 March announcing the shipment of the weapons for Ukraine.

On the 27 February, Sweden also announced the transfer of some 5,000 anti-armor weapons, with Swedish Prime Minister Magdelena Andersson and Defense Minister Peter Hultqvist confirming Swedish aid would also include some 5,000 body armour kits, 5,000 helmets, and 135,000 field rations. It is believed that the 5,000 systems to be sent will be Pansarskott m/86, the Swedish Army’s variant of the AT4 with a forward grip, it is a single-use, shoulder-fired 84mm anti-armor weapon. These are believed not to be the AT4-CS, suitable for use in confined spaces. On the same day the Norwegian Ministry of Defense has announced its intention to also dispatch 2,000 M72 LAW anti-armour weapons.

On the same day Belgium pledged 200 anti-tank weapons but Prime Minister Alexander De Croo did not specify which type would be sent. The Belgian armed forces currently stock M72 LAWs and RGW 90s. However, given the RGW 90 is slated to replace the M27 LAW it is possible that the older LAWs will be sent. Greece is also reported to have dispatched AKM-pattern rifles and an unspecified number of an unidentified ‘missile launcher’. Greek media has speculated that the launchers sent will be RPG-18, an older single-shot, disposable, shoulder-fired weapons similar to an M72 LAW.

The 28 February, saw a fresh round of weapons promised. The Finnish Ministry of Defense (Puolustusministeriö) confirmed that they will provide 2,500 assault rifles, 150,000 rounds of ammunition for the rifles, 1,500 single-use anti-tank weapons and 70,000 combat ration packages to Ukraine. The rifles are likely to be East German-built MPi-KM/KMS or Chinese Type 56s, both are AKM-pattern rifles. While unconfirmed the anti-tank weapons could be either French RAC 112 APILAS (which are nearing the end of their service life) or M72A2/A5 – both of which are currently in service with the Finnish defence forces. Both are single-use, shoulder-fired weapons.

The 28th also saw Italy’s government ratify a decree on sending military aid to Ukraine including small arms and light weapons. The shipments have reportedly included Stinger MANPADS and anti-tank weapons believed to be Panzerfaust 3s. Some Italian media outlets speculated that the weapons sent might be Spike ATGMs but this seems relatively unlikely as permission for their transfer would have to be cleared with the system’s Israeli manufacturer and it is a fairly new system for the Italian military. The types and quantities of the weapons sent have not been officially confirmed at the time of writing.

Luxembourg, one of Europe’s smallest nations also announced their intention to supply military aid to Ukraine with the transfer of 100 unspecified anti-tank weapon systems (reportedly NLAW, as this Luxembourg’s primary infantry anti-tank weapon), 20,000 rounds of small arms ammunition, some jeeps and tents.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that Australia will send $70AUD million in military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine. “We’re talking missiles, we’re talking ammunition, we’re talking supporting their defense of their own homeland… I’m not going to go into specifics of that because I don’t plan to give the Russian’s a heads up about what’s coming their way. But I can assure them, it’s coming your way.” The Australian Army currently fields M72 LAW, Carl Gustav 84mm recoilless rifles and Javelin ATGMs – it is likely that the type of ‘missile’ sent will be one of these.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on 28 February, during an address, that Canada will supply Ukraine “with anti-tank weapons systems and upgraded ammunition”. Minister of National Defence Anita Anand offered further detail stating Canada would be sending “100 Carl Gustav anti-tank weapon systems and 2,000 rockets… which we will be working to deliver as quickly as possible.” The Saab Bofors Dynamics-produced Carl Gustav 84mm recoilless rifle is not a rocket launcher but a recoilless rifle capable of firing a variety of munitions. It is a more robust weapon, capable of being used repeatedly, but as a result it heavier than some of the smaller single-use, shoulder-fired systems. The variant being sent by Canada is the older M2.

1 March saw Florence Parly, France’s Minister for the Armed Forces, announce that France would be sending “not only talking about protective equipment and fuels, but also about missiles and ammunition.” Le Monde have subsequently suggested these missiles represent a shipment of several dozen MILAN 2 wire guided anti-tank missiles.

In an unexpected move Spanish Minister of Defense, Margarita Robles, announced on 2 March that two shipments of lethal aid would be delivered to Ukraine on 4 March. The shipments will include 1,370 ‘grenade launchers’, an unspecified number of light machine guns and 700,000 rounds of small arms ammunition. The ‘launchers’ are believed to be infantry anti-tank weapons made by Instalaza, either Spain’s C-90 (comparable to the AT4) or Alcotán-100 (comparable to the NLAW). Both weapons are single-use, shoulder-fired systems which can be discarded after firing. At least one C90-CR-AM (M3.5) dual-purpose rocket has been visually confirmed to have reached troops on the frontline.

As recently as 2 March, the US Department of Defense announced a contract with the Raytheon – Lockheed Martin joint venture which manufactures the Javelin anti-tank guided missile for $19,541,045 to provide life cycle contractor support services for the US military and foreign military sales Javelin recipients including Estonia, Georgia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine. On the same day the Estonian Ministry of Defense stated that a second batch of Javelin systems donated by Estonia had reached Ukraine.

On 3 March, Ukraine’s Operational Command “North” have shared photos of troops being briefed on the use of NLAW and Javelin anti-tank weapons. Other such imagery has been shared since from the Azov National Guard battalion. The same day Canada’s Ministry of National Defence announced an additional package for Ukraine including “up to 4,500 M72 rocket launchers and up to 7,500 hand grenades” as well as funds towards high-resolution satellite imagery. Canada currently fields the M72A5-C1 variant of the M72.

Monitoring of flight trackers suggests that numerous flights of Western aid have begun to arrive in Poland with half a dozen flights landing at Rzeszow-Jasionka airport in southeastern Poland. It is believed that Rzeszow-Jasionka will become the staging point for aid heading into Ukraine over the coming days. On Sunday 27 February, President Biden authorized a $350 million package which included large, but unspecified, numbers of Javelin and in an unprecedentedly rapid turn around shipments began to arrive on 1 March according to a Department of Defense official. The typical turnaround time for this sort of transfer of weapons usually takes months, in this case it took less than a week. 70% of the $350 million package is reported to already be in Ukraine. Much of the ordnance is coming from forward pre-positioned stocks located in Germany. The logistical efforts are being led by US European Command, with a team co-ordinating aid from over a dozen countries.

Once the weapons reach Ukraine they are being shipped out across the country by truck and there is some evidence to suggest that they are being delivered to individual unit around cities like Kyiv in commercial vans.

Luckily the majority of the systems set are simple, disposable systems with manuals of arms which are relatively easy to learn quickly. Many of the extended-tube launchers like the LAW, C-90, and C-100 work in the same basic way. We have already seen imagery of the more complex systems like the NLAW and Javelin being explained in ad-hoc briefings to troops at depots.

How Effective Are These Weapons?

All of the weapons transferred are capable of knocking out Russian armoured personnel carriers, infantry fighting vehicles and armored fighting vehicles. They are all rated to penetrate at least 300mm of rolled homogeneous armour – more than enough to engage the majority of Russian armoured vehicles seen in Ukraine. The larger calibre, more capable weapons including Javelin, NLAW, APILAS, Panzerfaust 3 and the C-100 are capable of knocking out main battle tanks. Some of the smaller systems may also be able to knock out or at least damage Russian heavy armour – it depends on the area of hit, engagement range and the warhead type used by the weapon.

Javelin and NLAW have already entered the wider popular consciousness and become deeply associated with the conflict. And while we have seen evidence of their presence, and in some cases use, on the ground we can’t yet be sure just how widespread their use is or what impact they’re having. It is also important to remember that as these Western supplied anti-armour weapons proliferate into Ukraine that the Ukrainian Armed Forces have large stocks of Russian-designed and indigenous anti-armour weapons including the venerable RPG-7, the RPG-22, RPG-26 and RPV-16. These have been seen in action in numerous videos. They also have a range of medium anti-armour guided missiles including the Corsar (105mm) and Stugna-P (130mm). What is clear is that the Ukraine now has the most varied stock of infantry anti-armor weapons of any nation in Europe.

1,2bc16a37-4cd4-4de9-9549-97ba5e60f7eb,['James Dwyer'],2022-03-09 03:17:01+00:00,"Ukraine’s allies have sent some 17,000 anti-tank weapons into the battlefield, in a bid to help fighters bog down the Russian offensive.

The stockpile includes at least 2,000 NLAW (Next Generation Light Antitank Weapon) missiles from the United Kingdom, 100 NLAWs from Luxembourg, and several hundred Javelin missiles from the United States and Estonia. The NLAW and Javelin are some of the most advanced man-portable anti-tank missiles available.

Both are relatively lightweight, shoulder-fired missiles which – although they won’t completely turn the tide of the war – have so far proven valuable in what is otherwise a highly asymmetrical conflict.

So how do the missiles work? And what makes them so helpful for Ukraine’s defence?

What are anti-tank missiles?

Portable anti-tank missiles are specifically designed to destroy main battle tanks, which are more heavily armoured than other types of armoured vehicles (such as armoured personnel carriers, for instance).

Main battle tanks, which Russia has deployed in large numbers, use modern and highly advanced armour technology, including “explosive reactive armour” (or ERA). In other words, the tank’s armour explodes outwards when impacted by a warhead. This is intended to divert the blast and minimise the damage caused.

Pavel Nemecek/AP

However, explosive reactive armour actually isn’t much of an advantage against the modern anti-tank missiles being used by Ukrainian fighters. The NLAW and Javelin missiles are designed to hit a tank from above in a “top attack” – striking at the top of the tank’s turret where the armour is thinnest. This will either completely destroy the tank, or incapacitate the crew inside.

The missiles can also be used in “direct fire” mode against less well-armoured vehicles, such as armoured personnel carriers, buildings or even low-flying helicopters – with devastating results. This makes them a highly flexible and dangerous weapon for opposing forces.

Perhaps the greatest advantage of anti-tank missiles is their range and ease of use. They are relatively lightweight (between 10-25kg depending on the model), can be used by a single soldier and require (relatively) minimal training to handle. They are also extremely difficult to detect, due to their size and mobility.

Fire and forget

These modern missiles are fully guided “fire-and-forget” weapons, which means a soldier can immediately hide or relocate after firing. The projectile locks-on to the target and guides itself once fired.

In the case of a Javelin this is achieved using infrared technology, wherein the missile locks onto any heat signature present in the tanks.

NLAW missiles use “predictive line of sight” technology. The guidance package calculates both the distance to the target and the target’s speed (if its mobile), and guides itself to the predicted location. With this, a single soldier can snipe a tank at range.

NLAWs have a range of up to 1km, while the Javelin has a maximum effective range of up to 4.5km. Javelins are therefore much more expensive than NLAWs, with a single missile costing about US$80,000 (or A$110,000).

In the case of both the NLAW and Javelin, the warhead detonates upon impact with a hard object. A direct hit can be enough to wipe out a single tank if it impacts an area with thinner armour, such as the tanks turret – but it generally won’t have much impact on tanks nearby.

Even a glancing blow from one of these weapons may well be enough to incapacitate a tank, if not fully destroy it. Thus, anti-tank missiles pose a significant and, crucially, difficult-to-detect threat to Russian armoured columns.

A seemingly effective strategy

Russia does not appear to be relying on man-portable anti-tank weaponry to the same extent as Ukraine.

At this stage it’s drawing on a vast arsenal of tanks and aviation assets, such as attack helicopters, for its anti-tank capability. This may be due to Ukraine carefully husbanding and protecting its limited tank arsenal.

This could change at short notice, however, as Russia does possess its own anti-tank missiles.

Reports indicate Russians have suffered heavy losses against anti-tank weaponry, to the point where we’ve seen images and videos online showing Russian soldiers putting up makeshift mesh screens and cages over their tanks, in a (futile) effort to protect themselves.

These are colloquially termed “cope cages” by various communities on the internet. Of course, they will do little to minimise the impact from a missile, but they do demonstrate that Russian soldiers are fearful of the threat the missiles present.

Unverified reports indicate there have potentially been 280 armoured vehicles destroyed by Javelin’s in Ukraine, out of 300 fired. If the reports are true, this is a remarkable strike rate.

It appears these weapons have, in part, allowed the Ukraine army to bog down and stall the Russian advance, at a significant cost to Russia.",https://theconversation.com/how-do-anti-tank-missiles-work-and-how-helpful-might-they-be-for-ukraines-soldiers-178886

Britain has already given Ukraine 3,615 of the portable missile systems – nearly double the 2,000 figure previously mentioned.

According to the Defence Secretary’s statement to the House of Commons on Ukraine today:

“For our part, the United Kingdom continues to play a leading role in supporting Ukraine. On 17 January, I announced to the House the Government’s intention to supply military aid to the Ukrainian armed forces. The aid took the form of body armour, helmets, boots, ear defenders, ration packs, rangefinders and communication equipment, and for the first time it also included weapons systems. The initial supply was to be 2,000 new light anti-tank weapons (NLAWs), small arms and ammunition.

In response to further acts of aggression by Russia, we have now increased that supply. I can update the House that, as of today, we have delivered 3,615 NLAWs and continue to deliver more. We will shortly be starting the delivery of a small consignment of anti-tank Javelin missiles as well. I want to assure the House that everything we do is bound by the decision to supply defensive systems and is calibrated not to escalate to a strategic level.

Britain was the first European country to supply lethal aid. I was pleased that not long after a military aid donor conference I held on 25 February, many more countries decided to do the same. From right across Europe, the donations came. In particular, I want to highlight the Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Poland, Romania, the Baltic states, Belgium and Slovenia for their leadership, and we should not ignore the significance of the German Government joining us, in a change of stance, and donating such aid.

Donations are not enough; the delivery of aid to the front line is just as important. Here, again, Britain is leading, because alongside Canada, the United States and Sweden, we have invested in building Ukrainian military capacity since 2015, and we find ourselves able to co-ordinate the delivery alongside our partners.

As the conflict intensifies, the Russians are changing their tactics, so the Ukrainians need to, too. We can all see the horrific devastation inflicted on civilian areas by Russian artillery and airstrikes, which have been indiscriminate and murderous. It is therefore vital that Ukraine maintains its ability to fly and to suppress Russian air attack.

To date, the international community has donated more than 900 man-portable air defence missiles and thousands of anti-tank guided weapons of varying types, as well as various small arms. However, the capability needs strengthening, so in response to Ukrainian requests the Government have taken the decision to explore the donation of Starstreak high-velocity, man-portable anti-air missiles. We believe that this system will remain within the definition of defensive weapons, but will allow the Ukrainian forces to better defend their skies. We shall also be increasing supplies of rations, medical equipment, and other non-lethal military aid.”

Where do things stand today?

The illegal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine is continuing.

But which of these anti-tank systems is better? This question is asked not only by our readers in the comments, but by many. We have repeatedly said that each of the ATGWs has its own scenario of use and value, but who can better than others talk about weapons, other than the military, who use them in practice against the rascists. So, let’s hear what the member of 128th Mountain Assault Transcarpathian Brigade Anatolii, who had a chance to use both ATGWs, has to say about NLAW or Javelin.

“I am often asked which ATGW is the best – NLAW or Javelin. I will say from experience that it is best to use them in tandem. NLAW is excellent at close range – from 20 to 600 meters, so it is indispensable when combat actions take place in urban areas (cities and villages). And Javelin is best at a range of 1-2.5 kilometers, i.e. in the open field.

Both ATGWs are very effective. If properly aimed, they will hit the target 100 percent and destroy it. There is no such thing as a missile not piercing armor or anything. And all these lattices welded on Russian tanks, infantry fighting vehicles or armored personnel carriers are completely useless against them.

The Russians have already learnt this well, and where our NLAW and Javelin work, they aren’t showing their equipment. They know that if we fire, the missile will destroy the target and the entire landing crew will die in a second. In a nutshell, they are scared.

We only use NLAW and Javelin against heavy armored vehicles. We shoot trucks and other light targets from Ukrainian Corsar ATGWs. By the way, they are also effective against tanks and have proven themselves very well.

Recently, our mobile anti-tank group destroyed two Russian armored personnel carriers from Corsar and forced the BRDM (combat reconnaissance patrol vehicle) to leave the caponiere (special ground fortification). The operator ricocheted the BRDM from a Corsar, which caught fire and left the shelter, after which our tank destroyed it by direct fire in 10 seconds.”",https://mezha.media/en/2022/04/07/nlaw-or-javelin-which-one-s-better/
4,2bc16a37-4cd4-4de9-9549-97ba5e60f7eb,['Corky Siemaszko Is A Senior Writer For Nbc News Digital.'],2022-03-22 08:30:59.567000+00:00,"The Javelin antitank missiles that figured in former President Donald Trump’s first impeachment for deliberately delaying military aid to Ukraine are now wreaking havoc on the Russian invaders.

The lightweight but lethal weapon has, military experts said, helped the underdog Ukrainians inflict major damage on Moscow’s much-vaunted military and stymie their advance.

Not only has the United States-made weapon become a symbol of resistance, it’s been dubbed “Saint Javelin” in a meme circulating on the web created by Canadian marketer Christian Borys, which shows Mary Magdalene, a saint of the Orthodox church, cradling a Javelin in her arms.

“The Javelin, very specifically that system’s advanced capabilities, have been vital to Ukrainian military survival and ability to hold ground” against the Russians, said John Spencer, chair of urban warfare studies at the nonpartisan Madison Policy Forum in New York City.

Produced by defense contractors Raytheon and Lockheed Martin, the 46-pound weapon is shoulder-fired and has the “lethality to penetrate any tank or mobile vehicle on the battlefield,” Spencer said.

“It can also shoot down helicopters,” he said.

Mark Cancian of the Center for Strategic and International Studies agreed that the Javelins “have taken on a symbolic meaning beyond the military.”

“The Javelins are the most sophisticated and most effective weapon the Ukrainians have, but not the most numerous,” Cancian said.

The Ukrainians have more Israeli-made NLOS “Spike” antitank missiles in their arsenal as well as German Panzerfaust 3 antitank weapons, Cancian said.

“The short answer is that infantry antitank weapons (of which Javelin is one) seem to be quite effective,” Cancian said in an email to NBC News. “There are lots of social media videos of their use. Further, the Russians seem to be moving very slowly, if not actually stalled, and these weapons must be part of what has given the relatively small and weak Ukrainian forces so much ability to resist.”

Russia has roughly four times as many troops as Ukraine's 130,000-strong army. It also spends about $78 billion on its armed forces annually, compared to the $1.6 billion Ukraine has been able to budget for its military.

But Russia has only a quarter of its forces fighting in Ukraine, with the rest deployed in the Caucasus or defending the border with China. Meanwhile, Ukraine has some 900,000 reserves and is fighting on its home turf.

The FGM-148 Javelin is one of the more than 1,700 antitank weapons that have been rushed by NATO via Poland to Ukraine since Moscow’s forces invaded more than three weeks ago, and the evidence of their effectiveness soon became clear when the Russian tank advance on the capital city, Kyiv, was quickly stopped in its tracks, the experts said.

Manned most often by a team of two soldiers, the Javelin fires a heat-seeking missile with a range of up to 2.5 miles. It has what’s known as a “fire and forget” system, which allows the soldiers to quickly take cover after firing, before the enemy can detect them. It’s called a Javelin because it strikes tanks from the top like a spear, the experts said.

The Javelins can also fire directly at a target, making them a threat against low-flying helicopters, they said.

Also, they said, the Javelin is easy to use, which is a plus because much of the fighting in Ukraine is being done by civilians with very little military training.

The Ukrainians have touted the success of the Javelin by sharing images of their soldiers hefting the weapons along with photos of destroyed Russian tanks.

Kyiv put in its first order for a little over 200 Javelin missiles in 2018, according to various published reports. That same year, Trump signed an agreement to give Ukraine $250 million in military aid.

But it wasn’t until a year later that these weapons helped detonate a scandal that resulted in Trump’s first impeachment.

During a July 25, 2019, phone call with Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, “We are almost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.”

Trump replied, “I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it.”

Then Trump suggested that Zelenskyy should investigate the Ukrainian business dealings of Joe Biden, then considered Trump’s top rival for the presidency in 2020, and his son Hunter Biden, for possible corruption.

After the phone call with Zelenskyy, in which he was assured by the Ukrainian president that his new prosecutor would look into these matters, Trump released millions of dollars in military aid for Ukraine.

Trump was impeached by the Democratic-led House in December 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. But he was acquitted by the Senate, which had a Republican majority, of these charges in February 2020.

April 12, 2022

The United States has supplied Ukraine with thousands of Javelins, the anti-tank missiles that have become the iconic weapon of the war, but the U.S. inventory is dwindling. The United States has probably given about one-third of its stock to Ukraine. Thus, the United States is approaching the point where it must reduce transfers to maintain sufficient stockpiles for its own war plans. Production of new missiles is slow, and it will take years to replenish stocks.

The Russians have numerous armored vehicles, but their supply of trained crews and level of morale are declining. Will Ukrainian anti-tank weapons inflict enough Russian combat losses to produce a battlefield stalemate before Ukraine runs out of its most effective anti-tank weapons?

Javelins―the Iconic Weapon

To review, a Javelin is a long-range guided anti-tank missile that can be carried by one person. Javelins have become the iconic weapon of this war, with pictures of Mary Magdalene, dubbed St. Javelin, holding a weapon and even a Javelin song. It is the most sophisticated, capable, and expensive weapon out of the wide range of anti-tank munitions that NATO and other countries are providing to Ukraine. The United States says it has provided 7,000 to Ukraine.

Infantry anti-tank weapons have allowed Ukrainian forces, which are mostly light infantry, to defeat Russian mechanized forces despite their much greater firepower. It is important to note that Javelins are the most capable and best known of the anti-tank weapon systems but not the most numerous. That distinction goes to the NLAW, an anti-tank system with guidance but not as sophisticated as a Javelin's and lesser range. In addition, other nations have provided their own anti-tank weapons, such as the German Panzerfaust 3 and the Swedish Carl Gustav.

The United States has not published figures about its Javelin inventory, so this must be deduced. According to the Army budget books, total production has been 37,739 since production began in 1994. Every year, U.S. forces use some missiles for training and testing. Thus, there may be 20,000 to 25,000 remaining in the stockpiles. These 7,000 systems represent about one-third of the U.S. total inventory.

That fraction doesn't sound like much; after all, two-thirds of the inventory remains. However, military planners are likely getting nervous. The United States maintains stocks for a variety of possible global conflicts that may occur against North Korea, Iran, or Russia itself. At some point, those stocks will get low enough that military planners will question whether the war plans can be executed. The United States is likely approaching that point.

The obvious answer is to build more missiles (and launch units, the control box that goes on the missile). The United States has been buying Javelins at the rate of about 1,000 a year. The maximum production rate is 6,480 a year, though it would likely take a year or more to reach that level. The delivery time is 32 months; that is, once an order is placed, it will take 32 months before a missile is delivered. This means that it will take about three or four years to replace the missiles that have been delivered so far. If the United States delivers more missiles to Ukraine, this time to replace extends.

It's Not Just Javelins

The United States is providing a wide variety of other systems, such as small arms, tracking radars, and armored trucks (High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle). However, the numbers being provided are relatively small compared to likely inventories. For example, the United States has sent the Ukrainians 50 million rounds of ammunition. That sounds like a lot, but total U.S. ammunition production for military and civilian purposes is 8.7 billion per year. Deliveries to Ukraine comprise less than 1 percent of that.

One system for which inventories and replenishment rates are limited is the Stinger anti-aircraft missile. According to the White House fact sheet, the United States has provided 2,000 Stingers to the Ukrainians. The United States has not purchased any since 2003. At that time, the total production was stated as 11,600 missiles (from the FY 2000 budget documents). With testing and training losses of 1 percent a year, the remaining inventory would be about 8,000. So, the United States has sent about a quarter of its inventory to Ukraine.

In 2003, the last time the United States procured Stingers, production rates were stated as 275 with standard shifts (called ""1-8-5"") and 720 at maximum production rate. Production lead time was 24 months. That means it will take at least five years to replace the inventory drawdown (two years for lead time and three years for production).

The problem is that the production line is apparently kept alive only by a small number of foreign sales, so it may take longer than 24 months to ramp up. Further, the Department of Defense (DOD) has been thinking about the next generation of short-range air defense systems and may not want to buy more of what it considers an outmoded technology. So, there may be an extended period of risk when the inventory is low, but a replacement is not in the pipeline.

How Many Targets Are There for All Those Anti-tank Weapons?

According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) The Military Balance, the Russians have 2,800 tanks and 13,000 other armored vehicles (reconnaissance and infantry fighting vehicles) in units with another 10,000 tanks and 8,500 armored vehicles in storage. Open-source intelligence indicates that the Russians have lost about 1,300 armored vehicles. The bottom line is that the Russians are not going to run out of armored vehicles anytime soon.

What the Russians may run out of are trained crews and morale if the Ukrainians chew up enough armor. The Russians have lost about 40,000 troops, a quarter of their initial combat force, with especially high casualties in their elite units. Reinforcements and replacements can restore some of the numbers, but skills are deteriorating and morale, never high, seems to be declining. So, it is a race. Will Russian combat losses produce a battlefield stalemate before Ukraine runs out of its most effective anti-tank weapons?

From the Amari Air Base in Estonia, cargo planes are being loaded with ammunition and weaponry to be delivered to Ukraine’s armed forces. The NATO has also airlifted tonnes of military equipment into Poland and Romania on the western borders of Ukraine from where the weapons are transported by road into Ukraine.

Since the beginning of the conflict, NATO and the US have reportedly sent in 17,000 anti-tank weapons — these have included Javelin missiles, short-range next-generation light anti-tank weapons (NLAW), and rocket-controlled grenades.

Lieutenant General Deependra Singh Hooda (Retd), former General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Indian Army’s Northern Command, describes supplies on such scale as “unprecedented in short terms”.

While Ukraine’s troops have been credited for using missiles effectively and harsh climate conditions in northern Ukraine have stalled Russia’s march, larger themes amid the current stalemate need to be understood — what are the anti-tank missiles being used by Ukraine? What military strategies has Ukraine used to hold off Russia? What parts of Russia’s military strategy are questionable? What lessons can India draw for its military doctrine?

Anti-tank missiles Ukraine is using

The clash between Russia’s offensive military capacities and Ukraine’s defensive capabilities is encapsulated by Ukraine’s Lieutenant Yevgeny Yarantsev, who said to The New York Times, “they have a lot of tanks, we have a lot of anti-tank weapons”.

The Small Arms Survey describes anti-tank missiles as “portable, guided missiles” which are capable of changing course mid-flight to strike accurately at their target. Initially, these were developed to destruct armoured vehicles. However, they are also used against personnel, light vehicles and civilian structures.

The Javelin missiles being used extensively by the Ukrainian forces have been developed by the US. They represent the latest generation of anti-tank missiles and are programmed to attack the weakest part of an armoured vehicle — the top. Prior to impact, the missiles initiate a steep upward movement to ensure a downward strike on the roof of the vehicle.

The Javelin missile has an estimated range of approximately 3 kilometres. Its only shortcoming is that it weighs approximately 50 pounds (22.6 kg), not being the easiest missile to sling around.

The NLAW missiles also strike at the top of armoured vehicles. These fly a metre above the target prior to impact and then initiate a downward strike. They have a shorter range than the Javelin missiles, requiring the target to be within 800 metres. The NLAW weighs around 12.5 kg, and is relatively easy to carry and transport.

Together, these two anti-tank missiles have played a pivotal role in Ukraine’s targeted destruction of Russian armoury, disruption of supply lines and logistical commands, significantly helping the nation slow the invasion — for now.

Military strategies employed by Ukraine

Ukraine has effectively championed the strategies any weaker or smaller military would incorporate against a larger enemy — which is to avoid big, open, battles and conflicts, and focus on targeting supply chains. The attacks on supply chains have limited Russia’s ability to put up a cohesive assault.

In essence, Ukraine has relied on quick ambushes on supply lines and logistic commands —commonly described as “hit-and-run” manoeuvres.

Central to Ukraine’s defence have been attacks on large Russian attack convoys, like the much-hyped 64km convoy that was headed towards Kyiv, which could alter the balance of the conflict, if given a free path.

Further, the way Russia has deployed its armoured vehicles and convoys has also given the Ukrainians easy targets. Logistical and supply problems, compounded by fuel shortages, have left many Russian vehicles simply standing and holding ground. These have then become easy targets for Ukraine’s anti-tank missiles.

Moreover, the Ukrainians have maximised their advantage of “home conditions”, adeptly choosing where and how to use firepower and swiftly transporting troops from one conflict area to another.

Russia’s ‘miscalculations’

Russia’s military miscalculations could be attributed to biased intelligence reports that guided their approach prior to the war.

Russian intelligence assumed that Ukraine would collapse within a few days of an invasion. The nation’s strategists overestimated their strengths and underestimated Ukraine’s military capacity and national unity.

Symptomatic of the flawed intelligence and military designs guiding Russia’s approach, there has been no use of the “combined arms” doctrine. Therefore, the infantry, tanks, and airpower have not been used simultaneously and cohesively to launch a comprehensive attack.

There has also been a human resource management problem at the Russian side. Inadequate numbers of battalions have been deployed to launch attacks. In many cases, only two or three battalions were deployed to mount an attack.

Further, tanks and armoured vehicles have been sent with an insufficient number of soldiers to protect them. The Russians have also stuck to the highways and main roads — making them easy targets for the Ukrainians.

Another major impediment to Russia’s invasion has been poor logistical planning. Supply chains, communication lines, and command and control protocols have been bungled up, leading to a situation where vehicles run out of fuel and troops do not know their objectives.

Inexperienced forces that have included conscripts and non-commissioned officers have been sent to the frontlines, without being empowered to make decisions, and neither have they previously taken important decisions.

Colonel Vivek Chadha (Retd), research fellow with the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, states that Russia has deviated significantly from its recent campaigns in Syria and Crimea. The use of proxies, limited campaigns, and asymmetric warfare should have guided its current approach too.

Finally, Russia has resorted to mass targeting of civilians and has abandoned the idea of “surgical strikes” and hitting only the opposing army. This could potentially give rise to insurgencies that could linger for decades, even if Russia manages to eventually overpower Ukraine.

Military lessons for India

Colonel Chadha said, “for India, Russia’s campaigns provide several lessons”.

“Firstly, the success and learnings from previous military campaigns should be factored into any new military strategy,” he added.

Secondly, any modern-day military campaign should have its end goals clearly stated. These should be achievable, pragmatic, short-term and not “over-ambitious”, he pointed out.

Colonel Chadha added that for any campaign, supply chains and logistic commands are the fulcrum. “These should be given priority, and timely and methodical planning. As we have seen for Russia, without plans set in place for these, the campaign has struggled,” he said.

Finally, he stated, “any campaign in a country where the population doesn’t support you will have significant costs on life and resources. This should be assessed prior to any campaign”.

Although Ukraine has been able to stall Russia and has been aided by western armaments and Russia’s military planning failures, it is difficult to gauge how long this half-stalemate will last.

Updating MPs on the Ukraine war in the Commons, he told MPs that the UK has delivered 3,615 anti-tank (NLAW) weapons and will soon be supplying a ""small consignment"" of Javelin anti-tank missiles.

He said the Russians are ""changing their tactics and so the Ukrainians need to too"", to help Ukraine forces tackle President Putin's air force.

Mr Wallace said that the UK is exploring the possibility of donating Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine.

Supplies of rations, medical equipment and other non-lethal military aid will also be increased, the defence secretary said.

Starstreak missiles travel at more than three times the speed of sound, according to the British Army, and can be shoulder-mounted or attached to a vehicle.

NLAWs are a portable, shoulder-mounted missile system weighing just 12.5kg. They have a range of up to 600 metres.

The British Army says the missile can destroy ""any main battle tank in just one shot by striking it from above"".

Also, the Javelin is a medium-range missile that can strike targets at up to 1.5 miles (2.5km) away.

It is heavier than an NLAW, at 24.3kg, and is a ""fire and forget"" system, allowing the user to lock on to a target, fire and then focus on a different target.
