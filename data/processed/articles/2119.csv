ANKARA

President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has described the Russian military operation against Ukraine as a serious blow to regional security and as an unacceptable act, as he presided a security summit to assess the ongoing developments following the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

“Let me start by saying that we consider Russia’s operation against Ukraine as unacceptable and we reject it,” Erdoğan said at a meeting in Ankara on Feb. 24. “This attack, which we see as a violation of international law, is a serious blow to peace and stability.”

Erdoğan talked to Ukrainian President Volodmyry Zelensky on Feb. 24 and assured him Turkey’s support to Ukraine’s political unity and territorial integrity will continue.

“I have told Mr. Zelensky that we support Ukraine’s struggle for the protection of its territorial integrity,” he added.

“We want the problems between these two countries, with whom we have very good relations, should be resolved in the context of the Minsk agreements. I also said this to Mr. [Russian President Vladimir] Putin last night,” he recalled. Erdoğan and Putin had a phone conversation late Feb. 23 to discuss the situation.

Turkey will do whatever necessary for the protection of everyone in Ukraine, particularly Turkish citizens and Tatars, Erdoğan said.

Turkey holds security summit

Following the start of the military operation by the Russian army against Ukraine, Erdoğan presided a security summit with the participation of senior civilian and military officials on Feb. 24 to have a detailed assessment on the developments and decide what measures will be taken in due course. Vice President Fuat Oktay, Defense Minister Hulusi Akar, Chief of General Staff Gen. Yaşar Güler and National Intelligence Organization (MİT) chief Hakan Fidan were among the participants.

A statement issued following the summit reiterated that this attack violates international law and Turkey finds it unacceptable. It repeated that Turkey will continue to support Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.

‘Russia should halt operation’

The first statement from Ankara came from the Turkish Foreign Ministry.

“We consider the military operation launched by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation against Ukraine unacceptable and reject it. This attack, beyond destroying the Minsk agreements, is a grave violation of international law and poses a serious threat to the security of our region and the world,” read a statement issued by the Foreign Ministry on Feb. 24.

Believing in the necessity to respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of countries, Turkey is against the changing of borders by use of arms, it said. “We call on the Russian Federation to immediately stop this unjust and unlawful act.”

“Our support to Ukraine’s political unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity will continue,” it added.

In a separate statement, the Foreign Ministry issued a security warning for its citizens in Ukraine on Feb. 24 and said it would provide necessary support and guidance to Turks who wish to leave Ukraine. The ministry advised Turkish citizens to stay at their houses or in safe places and avoid traveling.

Çavuşoğlu speaks with Borrell by phone

Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu spoke with the EU’s high representative for foreign and security policies, Josep Borrell, on the phone during his visit to Kazakhstan. The two men discussed the recent developments following the Russian operation against Ukraine.

Summary Erdogan 'sincerely saddened' by Russian invasion

Turkish foreign ministry calls for end to fighting

Kyiv asks Turkey to close Black Sea waterways to Russia

Ankara will evaluate the request, Ukrainian envoy says

ANKARA, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Turkey backs Ukraine's territorial integrity and is ""sincerely saddened"" by Russia's invasion, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday, as Kyiv's envoy to Ankara urged Turkey to close the Bosphorus straits to Russian warships.

Earlier on Thursday, Russian forces launched an invasion of Ukraine, assaulting by land, sea and air in the biggest attack by one state against another in Europe since World War Two. read more

Erdogan, who has forged good relations with the leaders of both Russia and Ukraine and had previously offered to mediate in the conflict, said he had spoken with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy by telephone.

""Turkey supports Ukraine's battle to protect its territorial integrity,"" Erdogan said in remarks broadcast by Turkish TV.

""We are sincerely saddened that Russia and Ukraine, both of whom we see as friendly countries and with whom we have close political, economic, and social relations, come face to face in this way.""

Ukraine's ambassador to Ankara, Vasyl Bodnar, told reporters that Zelenskiy had asked Erdogan for help during their call. The ambassador did not outline Kyiv's demands, but said ""financial, humanitarian, and military"" support was needed.

Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar later discussed the latest developments in Ukraine with his Ukrainian counterpart Oleksiy Reznikov, his ministry said.

BOSPHORUS

Earlier, Bodnar had urged NATO member Turkey to close the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits to Russian ships.

Under a 1936 pact, Ankara has control over the straits and can limit the passage of warships during wartime or if threatened.

""Turkey will evaluate the requests and respond as soon as possible,"" Bodnar said after talks with Turkish Deputy Foreign Minister Sedat Onal. ""We expect solidarity to be shown.""

Ukraine's appeal puts Turkey in a difficult position as it shares a maritime border with Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea and does not want to antagonise either country.

Asked about Ukraine's request, Omer Celik, the spokesman for Erdogan's ruling AK Party, said Turkey was evaluating the issue and that Ankara would make a decision with the aim of not deepening the conflict. He provided no further details.

Earlier this month, six Russian warships and a submarine transited the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits to the Black Sea for what Moscow called naval drills near Ukraine waters. read more

On Thursday Russian forces landed at Ukraine's Black and Azov Sea ports as part of the invasion.

Turkey's foreign ministry called for an immediate end to Russia's military operations.

""This attack is a grave violation of international law and poses a serious threat to the security of our region and the world,"" the ministry said. ""We call on the Russian Federation to immediately end this unjust and unlawful act.""

Ambassador Bodnar urged Turkey to join other countries in imposing sanctions on Russia, something Ankara has so far opposed as it tries to balance its NATO commitments with its strong trade and energy ties to Russia. read more

Celik said Turkey was not considering any sactions against Russia at present.

On Thursday, Turkey advised its citizens in Ukraine to stay at home or in a safe place and avoid traveling, after airlines cancelled flights due to the closure of Ukraine's air space.

Addressing reporters in Istanbul ahead of a virtual NATO leaders summit following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Erdoğan said that NATO's reaction to the Russian military attack should have been more decisive, adding that condemnation alone will not suffice.

He also said that the European Union and the West have not exhibited a firm stance on the issue thus far.

""It should not turn into an ordinary flurry of condemnation. NATO should have taken a more decisive step,"" Erdoğan said adding: ""The EU and all Western mentalities did not show a seriously determined stance, they are all constantly advising Ukraine. It is not possible to get anywhere with advice. When you look at the steps taken, there are no steps taken.""

NATO member Turkey borders Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea and has good ties with both. It has called on Russia to end its attack and voiced support for Ukraine's territorial integrity. While forging close cooperation with Russia on defense and energy, Turkey has also sold drones to Ukraine and signed a deal to co-produce more. Ankara also opposes Russian policies in Syria and Libya, as well as its annexation of Crimea in 2014.

Meanwhile, senior Turkish officials conducted intense diplomatic traffic on the issue.

President Erdoğan on Thursday spoke over the phone with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron.

The two sides discussed Russia's military intervention in Ukraine and the latest developments, a statement by the Communications Directorate said.

Both Turkey and France condemned Moscow’s decision to launch an invasion of Ukraine earlier on Thursday after it assaulted the country by land, sea and air in the biggest attack by one state against another in Europe since World War II. Russian forces targeted key areas of Ukrainian cities with weapons and missiles in what Moscow called a special operation against its neighbor.

Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu discussed the latest developments in Ukraine with his American counterpart by phone late Thursday, said the Foreign Ministry.

In the call with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Çavuşoğlu reiterated that Turkey rejects Russia's military operation in Ukraine, which it considers a serious violation of international law, the ministry said.

He also stressed that Turkey will continue to support Ukraine's territorial integrity, political unity and sovereignty, it added.

Çavuşoğlu and Blinken also exchanged views on the processes currently underway at the United Nations, NATO, the European Council and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in light of the developments in Ukraine, according to the statement.

On the call, U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price highlighted that Blinken thanked Turkey for its strong, vocal support in defense of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. He also said Blinken ""emphasized that Russia's destructive actions will reverberate throughout Europe and the broader world.""

Moreover, Blinken said on Twitter that the U.S. and Turkey ""continue our close coordination as NATO allies against Russia's unprovoked military attacks on Ukraine.""

On Friday, Çavuşoğlu also held phone calls with the EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell and Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmitro Kuleba.

Borrell said on Twitter: ""We agreed to continue coordinating, to bring this unacceptable aggression to an end as quickly as possible.""

Defense Minister Hulusi Akar and his British counterpart Ben Wallace also held a phone call and discussed regional defense and security issues, focusing on the developments in Ukraine.

Deputy Foreign Minister Sedat Önal on Thursday also underlined that the military assault launched by Russia against Ukraine is ""unacceptable.""

Speaking at the OSCE Permanent Council meeting via videoconference, Önal said: ""We reject this assault, as we rejected the decision to recognize the so-called breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk.""

Önal described the Russian assault as a ""blatant violation of international law,"" adding that the recent move contravenes the Minsk agreements and poses a serious threat to the security and stability of the region and the world.

""We remain committed to and will continue to support the preservation of the sovereignty, political unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders, including Crimea and Donbas,"" said Önal.

Calling on Russia to stop this ""unlawful assault"" and return to dialogue and diplomacy, the diplomat added that Turkey is ready to work with all parties to facilitate a peaceful resolution of this crisis.

Turkey has described the Russian offensive into Ukraine as “unacceptable,” calling it a grave violation of international law that poses a serious threat to the security of the region and world. Rejecting the Russian intervention in Ukraine, Ankara called on Moscow to end the “unfair and unlawful” military operations as soon as possible.

Due to the latest developments, President Erdoğan on Thursday chaired a security summit in the capital Ankara where it was concluded that Russia’s attack was “a violation of international law” and “unacceptable,” according to the Presidency.

Measures that can be taken with Russia and at international platforms for an “end to the attack that threatens regional and global security” were also discussed at the summit, it said, noting that Turkey “will continue to support Ukraine’s political unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity.”

Later in the day, Erdoğan in a televised speech reiterated that Turkey supports Ukraine’s battle for territorial integrity and views Russia’s attack as a “heavy blow” to regional stability and peace, repeating a call to resolve the crisis through dialogue. “This step, which we view as against international law, is a heavy blow struck on regional peace, harmony and stability,” he said.

He said Turkey, which has a maritime border with both Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea, views both countries as friendly, expressing that he was “sincerely saddened” by the Moscow-Kyiv conflict.

“Beyond eliminating the Minsk agreements, this attack is a grave violation of international law and poses a serious threat to the security of our region and the world,” the Foreign Ministry also said in a statement. “We call on the Russian Federation to immediately end this unjust and unlawful act.”

NATO member Turkey has sought to position itself as a mediator for a resolution to the crisis. Erdoğan, who stepped up diplomacy with phone calls to the Russian and Ukrainian leaders this week, said Turkey had no desire to abandon ties with either of the countries.

Meanwhile, Ukraine has asked Turkey to close the Bosporus and Dardanelles to Russian ships, after Russia launched air and ground assaults on its neighbor. The Ukrainian ambassador said his country expected solidarity from NATO member Turkey and that it should not remain impartial after Russia launched its offensive.

The request puts NATO member Turkey, which shares a maritime border with Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea and has good relations with both countries, in a difficult position. Under a 1936 pact, Ankara has control over the straits and can limit warship passages during wartime or if threatened.

Under the 1936 Montreux Convention, NATO member Turkey has control over the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits linking the Mediterranean and Black seas. The pact gives Ankara the power to regulate the transit of naval warships and to close the straits to foreign warships during wartime and when threatened.

“We are calling for the air space, Bosporus and Dardanelles straits to be closed. We have conveyed our relevant demand to the Turkish side. At the same time, we want sanctions imposed on the Russian side. Particularly, we demand the seizure of the shares of the Russian business world here,” Ukrainian Ambassador to Turkey Vasyl Bodnar told a news conference in Ankara.

Turkey has opposed sanctions on Russia, saying that they will only delay solving underlying problems. Erdoğan has said Ankara would try managing the crisis without abandoning ties with either Moscow or Kyiv, but has also called Russian steps against Ukraine unacceptable, while also offering to mediate.

The February 2014 ""Maidan revolution"" in Ukraine led to former President Viktor Yanukovych fleeing the country and a pro-Western government coming to power.

That was followed by Russia illegally annexing the Crimea region and separatists declaring independence in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Donbass in eastern Ukraine, both of which have large ethnic Russian populations.

As clashes erupted between Russian-backed separatist forces and the Ukrainian army, the 2014 and 2015 Minsk agreements were signed in Moscow after the intervention of Western powers.

The conflict, however, simmered for years with persistent cease-fire violations. As of February 2022, some 14,000 people have been killed in the conflict in eastern Ukraine.

Tensions started escalating late last year when Ukraine, the U.S. and its allies accused Russia of amassing tens of thousands of troops on the border with Ukraine.

They claimed Russia was preparing to invade its western neighbor, allegations that were consistently rejected by Moscow.

Defying threats of sanctions by the West, Moscow officially recognized Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states earlier this week, followed by the start of a military operation in Ukraine on Thursday.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said the operation aims to protect people ""subjected to genocide"" by Kyiv and to ""demilitarize and denazify"" Ukraine while calling on the Ukrainian army to lay down its arms.",https://www.dailysabah.com/politics/diplomacy/turkey-urges-nato-west-to-take-decisive-stance-on-ukraine-crisis

Warschefsky']",2022-02-24 16:57:46-05:00,"Despite weeks of warning, Russia’s Feb. 24 decision to launch an invasion of Ukraine caught much of the world by surprise. Russian President Vladimir Putin released what appeared to be a prerecorded statement just as the offensive began, wherein he described the commencement of a “special military operation” aimed at defending the Ukrainian breakaway territories of Donetsk and Luhansk, which he had recently recognized as independent countries, as well as the “demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine.” Within minutes, the first of a barrage of missile strikes hit targets around the country as Russian ground troops moved into Ukrainian territory, initiating what is believed to be the biggest attack on a European state since World War II.

Perhaps not coincidentally, Putin made his announcement just as the U.N. Security Council was convening a special session on the Ukraine crisis. The ensuing debate provided a microcosm into much of the world’s initial reactions to Russia’s actions. While many member states quickly condemned Russia’s actions, others—most notably China and India—made more general calls for deescalation on all sides and a return to diplomatic dialogue. Russia’s representative continued to defend its actions as necessary responses to Ukraine’s own hostility toward the people of Donetsk and Luhansk. Ukraine’s representative, meanwhile, called on Russia to end its aggression, noting: “[T]here is no purgatory for war criminals—they go straight to hell.”

“The prayers of the entire world are with the people of Ukraine tonight[,]” President Biden said in his own press statement shortly after the invasion began. But much of the world has only begun to formulate its formal response to Russia’s actions. This post brings together the official responses we have been able to locate thus far. We will update this list—which was last updated at 3:00 p.m. on March 4—as more official statements become available.

Jeffrey', 'Merissa Khurma', 'February', 'Achref Chibani', 'Peter Schwartzstein', 'Prince El Hassan Bin Talal', 'Saba Gheshan', 'Julia Taleb', 'Lynn Mounzer']",,"On Thursday, February 24, Russia launched a series of missile attacks against locations near Ukrainian capital Kiev, an assault that quickly spread across the country by land, sea, and air. The enormity of the Russian attack, not just on Ukraine but on the long-term global security order, is increasingly clear among states in the Middle East region, and puts pressure on the ‘hedging’ between the U.S. on one hand and Russia and China on the other, commonplace in recent years.

While Middle East countries, including the US' close military and diplomatic partners UAE and Israel, initially hedged their bets between the two superpowers, the continued Russian aggression has pushed almost all into the Ukraine camp. Turkey has been particularly vocal from Presidant Erdogan supporting Ukraine bilaterally and in NATO, and then taking the unprecedented step of restricting Russian naval transport of the of the Bosphorous Straits under the ""war"" clause of the Montreux Straits Convention, which Turkey controls.

The regional shift can be seen in the UN General Assembly, where on March 2, 141 countries voted in favor of the UN GA resolution to condemn Russian forces. From MENA, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman, the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey voted ""Yes"", Syria voted ""No"", and Algeria, Iraq, and Iran abstained. Algeria has long been pro-Moscow and Iraq, given its internal situation, avoids taking sides. Syria's vote is not unexpected. Iran, however, clearly seeing itself as a potential target of attack, abstained rather than supported its partner Russia, not so much for Ukraine but for the principle of non-interference in soverign states.

A region (mostly) united

Initially, most Arab governments maintained a neutral stance on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, unsurprisingly, given their reticence to pick a side that they believe may jeopardize their relations with either the United States and the Europeans and their equally strategic relations with Russia. In a statement delivered by Saudi UN representative Mohammed Abdulaziz Alateek at the General Assembly, the GCC countries confirmed “the depth of relations” they have with both parties and called on “all parties to exercise restraint.” Nevertheless, Saudi Arabia remains firm in standing with its OPEC+ agreement that is keeping oil prices high rather than pump more crude oil to help the United States and the West, at America’s insistence. Whether the Kingdom maintains this position or contributes to bringing oil prices down in the weeks to come remains to be seen and depends on how far Putin goes in Ukraine.

The notable exception to the neutral Arab stance is of course Syria, whose President Bashar Al Assad reiterated his support of Russia in his call to President Putin and called the Russian invasion in Ukraine a “correction of history.” A staunch ally of Russia, that kept him power since the beginning of the Arab uprisings, the Syrian President will likely feel emboldened by a seemingly ‘stronger’ Russia, which also gives other regional powers, namely Iran, more opportunities to strengthen its influence in Syria and destabilize the neighborhood.
