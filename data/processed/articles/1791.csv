0,adf253ec-bd1f-40da-b744-a14e37a66a82,[],,"MADRID (Reuters) - Likening the Russian bombing of his country to the bloody air raid on the Spanish town of Guernica by Nazi Germany, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told Spain's parliament on Tuesday the West must do more to force Moscow to abandon its invasion.

Shortly after addressing the United Nations Security Council, Zelenskiy told Spanish lawmakers to contemplate the current situation where hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are living in fear without water, food or medicine, and he called on Spanish companies still operating in Russia to leave.

Earlier on Tuesday, Spain followed several other European countries and pledged to expel 27 Russian diplomats.

""Imagine that people now - in Europe - live for weeks in basements to save lives. From shelling, from air bombs. It's April 2022, and the reality in Ukraine is the same as in April 1937. When the whole world learned the name of one of your cities - Guernica,"" Zelenskiy said.

Adolf Hitler sent aircraft in support of Francisco Franco's nationalist forces to strike the Basque town on April 26, 1937, killing as many as 1,600 and wounding hundreds. The tragedy drove Pablo Picasso to paint a masterpiece of the same name.

Calling for further international sanctions against Moscow, Zelenskiy praised Spanish companies that have stopped operations in Russia while singling out some businesses still working there.

""I know that many of your companies have already stopped financing the Russian military machine through taxes. I am also grateful to your state and society for its principled position on sanctions,"" he told a packed lower house in Madrid.

But he appealed directly to blasting equipment provider Maxam, ceramics group Porcelanosa, and capital-goods manufacturers association Sercobe to stop doing business with Russia.

Porcelanosa said it has not initiated any new sales in Russia since the invasion, but had fulfilled contracts with distributors signed before the war.

""In March the Russian market represented only 0.009% of the company's sales...equivalent to 197,000 euros,"" the company said in a statement.

Neither Maxam nor Sercobe responded to requests for comment.

“It’s April 2022 but it seems like April 1937 when the whole world heard about one of your cities, Guernica,” he told lawmakers, referencing the carpet-bombing of the town by aircraft from Hitler’s “Condor Legion” during Spain’s 1936-1939 civil war in support of Francisco Franco’s nationalist forces.



Hundreds of people were killed, many of whom were at a weekly market in the town center, in an atrocity that shocked the world and was immortalized in Picasso’s haunting anti-war painting.



For the latest headlines, follow our Google News channel online or via the app.



Historians give an estimated death toll of between 150 and 300 people, while the Basque authorities give a much higher figure of 1,654.



Zelenskyy’s 10-minute video link speech came after he addressed the UN Security Council for the first time, demanding it expel Russia over its brutal invasion and that Moscow be held accountable for its atrocities against civilians.



“We never thought that we would once again see shocking images of bombings and massacres of innocent people on European soil,” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said in brief remarks after Zelenskyy’s speech.



The Ukrainian leader’s latest addresses followed a wave of global outrage over the harrowing discoveries of civilian victims in Bucha and other towns near Kyiv after Russian troops pulled back.



So far, Ukrainian officials say over 400 civilian bodies have been recovered from the wider Kyiv region, many of which were buried in mass graves.



The Kremlin has denied any civilian killings and claimed that the images are fakes produced by Ukraine forces, or that the deaths occurred after Russian soldiers pulled out of the areas.



Europe’s worst conflict in decades has killed as many as 20,000 people, according to Ukrainian estimates.



Nearly 4.25 million Ukrainians have fled the country during Russia’s invasion, while a further 7.1 million are thought be internally displaced within Ukraine, the UN said Tuesday.

People in the besieged city of Mariupol are still only able to flee on foot or by private car as efforts to organise mass evacuations by bus to safer parts of Ukraine have failed, Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in an online post.

A total of 3,846 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities through humanitarian corridors on Tuesday, slightly more than the 3,376 who escaped on Monday, the deputy prime minister said.

Vereshchuk said seven buses trying to get to Mariupol had not managed to make their way through a Russian blockade to reach the first part of the evacuation route out of the city.

Von der Leyen said the ban on coal imports is worth €4 billion per year. She added that the EU has already started working on additional sanctions, including on oil imports.

Von der Leyen didn’t mention natural gas. A consensus among the 27 EU member countries on targeting gas that’s used to generate electricity, heat homes and power industry would be more difficult to secure.

Russia, meanwhile, has only confirmed 498 casualties so far – a number that was made public in the beginning of March but which has not been updated since then.

Death tolls in the conflict have been extremely difficult for independent observers to verify due to the lack of trustworthy information and the challenges of accessing the most violence-fraught areas.

Russia denied any accusations related to the murder of civilians, including in Bucha. Its envoy to the United Nations, Vasily Nebenzya, said Russia will present ""empirical evidence"" to the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday showing its forces were not involved in atrocities.

07:57 am: ‘Extraordinary defeat of Russian forces’ in Bucha

Despite the massive destruction and dead civilians they allegedly left behind them, Russian forces do not seem to have retreated from the town of Bucha, near Kyiv, voluntarily, but rather because they faced an “extraordinary defeat” by Ukrainian troops. “It was clearly not an orderly withdrawal from these areas. There are destroyed Russian military vehicles absolutely everywhere,” FRANCE 24’s Ukraine correspondent Gulliver Cragg reports.

The speech will be Zelensky's first to the UN body since Russia's invasion. It comes after he made an emotional trip to Bucha outside the capital, where dozens of bodies were discovered after the withdrawal of Russian troops.

Horrific images of corpses lying in the streets, some with their hands bound behind them, have drawn international condemnation.

“Who have they punished? First of all, themselves.”

On Monday, France said it would expel 35 Russian diplomats over Moscow’s actions in Ukraine and Germany declared “significant number” of Russian diplomats as undesirable.

“If this continues, it will be fitting, as I wrote back on 26th February – to slam shut the door on Western embassies,” Medvedev said. “It will be cheaper for everyone. And then we will end up just looking at each other in no other way than through gunsights.”

Zelensky praised Spain for its support in their resistance to Russia’s invasion last February.

He appealed for ‘more weapons and sanctions’.

Zelensky said: “I know that the defence of democracy and peace on the European continent is very important for Spain. But how do we achieve it if Russia piles in resources to destroy everything?”

The president also had strong words for Spanish companies that still trade with Russia.

Zelensky said: “I know that many Spanish companies have stopped operating in Russia, and I want to thank those companies and all the people.”

“There are however companies like Porcelanosa or Maxim and others that are still doing business and should know better,” he added.

“How do they allow Russian banks to make profits while they are torturing people? How do they allow European companies to make profits while destroying my country?” asked Zelensky.

In a reference to the aerial bombing suffered by Basque town Guernica during the Spanish Civil War in 1937, Zelensky said: “In April 2022, the people of Ukraine are hiding in attics. Imagine people hiding in Guernica in April 1937.”

“Imagine mothers in Ukraine writing on the backs of their children the names and contact numbers of friends and relatives, in case the occupiers kill their parents, so that they have a chance,” Zelensky continued.

Besides parliamentarians, ambassadors of EU and NATO states were in the guest gallery of Congress, along with Ukrainian refugees and expats.

“It’s April 2022 but it seems like April 1937 when the whole world heard about one of your cities, Guernica,” he said of the carpet-bombing of the northern town by Nazi aircraft during Spain’s 1936-1939 civil war in support of Francisco Franco’s nationalist forces.

Hundreds of people were killed, many of whom were at a weekly market in the town centre, in an atrocity that shocked the world and was immortalised in Picasso’s haunting anti-war painting.

Historians give an estimated death toll of between 150 and 300 people, while the Basque authorities give a much higher figure of 1,654.

He compared the Guernica assault to the situation in the southeastern port city of Mariupol which has been under siege by Russian forces for over a month.

“Just imagine more than 100,000 residents are living without water, food or medicine because the Russian army has cut off the city of Mariupol,” he told lawmakers

“They are destroying the city, there’s nothing, it’s all in ruins… the people are dead, buried in their own gardens. The Russians were bombing Mariupol knowing people and children were hiding there.”

The city’s mayor told AFP on Tuesday that an estimated 120,000 residents are believed to have stayed behind and were existing in a situation that went “beyond a humanitarian disaster”.

‘Outrage and revulsion’

The Ukrainian leader’s 10-minute address followed a wave of global outrage over the harrowing discoveries of civilian victims in Bucha and other towns near Kyiv after Russian troops pulled back.

So far, Ukrainian officials say over 400 civilian bodies have been recovered from the wider Kyiv region, many of which were buried in mass graves.

Zelensky spoke immediately after he addressed the UN Security Council for the first time, demanding it expel Russia over its brutal invasion and that Moscow be held accountable for its atrocities against civilians.

“We never thought that we would once again see shocking images of bombings and massacres of innocent people on European soil,” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said after Zelensky’s speech.

“Atrocities like those in Mariupol and Bucha give us the greatest feeling of outrage and revulsion. They are war crimes that cannot go unpunished.”

The Kremlin has denied any civilian killings and claimed that the images from the Kyiv region are fakes produced by Ukraine forces, or that the deaths occurred after Russian soldiers pulled out of the areas.

Europe’s worst conflict in decades has killed as many as 20,000 people, according to Ukrainian estimates.

Nearly 4.25 million Ukrainians have fled the country during Russia’s invasion, while a further 7.1 million are thought to be internally displaced within Ukraine, the UN said Tuesday.",https://guardian.ng/news/world/zelensky-says-ukraine-assault-like-razing-of-guernica/

In a letter to Biden on Tuesday shared with CNN, Sen. Ed Markey and Rep. Bill Keating, both of Massachusetts, expressed concern that Russia could lash out with further cyberattacks in Ukraine or with hacking that tests NATO’s resolve as Russian military progress in Ukraine stalls.

A cyberattack last week on Ukrtelecom, which describes itself as Ukraine’s largest “fixed line” internet and phone provider, that reportedly knocked connectivity down at the telecom operator to 13% of its pre-war levels.

The lawmakers, both members of their respective chamber’s foreign affairs committees, want a newly formed cybersecurity bureau at the State Department to bolster US cooperation with Ukraine and European allies on cybersecurity issues, and in turn help defend against Russian hacking threats.

A spokesperson for Markey’s office called the $37 million the White House requested from Congress to run the bureau in fiscal 2023 a “strong starting point,” but said that it was “imperative” that the State Department coordinate with government entities like the US Cyber Command and the Department of Homeland Security that have long provided cybersecurity assistance to Ukraine.

CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.

Separate from the new bureau, the State Department has overseen millions of dollars in aid to Kyiv to shore up its networks in recent years. And the head of US Cyber Command, the military’s hacking unit, said Tuesday that the command dispatched a team of cyber specialists to Ukraine late last year to help defend Ukrainian infrastructure.

More on the hacks: While there have been an array of Russia-linked hacking incidents against Ukrainian organizations since the war began, there haven’t been the level of disruptive hacks against critical infrastructure that some analysts feared.

One exception was a cyberattack at the onset of the war that knocked out internet service for tens of thousands of satellite modems in Ukraine and elsewhere in Europe. US officials are investigating that incident as a potential state-sponsored Russian hack, CNN previously reported.

On March 21, Biden warned US business executives that “the magnitude of Russia's cyber capacity is fairly consequential and it's coming."" So far, no consequential hacks on US organizations publicly attributed to the Russian government have emerged. But US officials continue to prepare for the possibility.

Markey and Keating asked Biden to “promptly” nominate an ambassador-at-large to lead the State Department’s new cybersecurity bureau. (Secretary of State Antony Blinken told State Department employees Monday that Biden would nominate someone for the role “very soon.”)

The Democratic lawmakers also want to know what lessons the Biden administration have learned from Russian hacking in Ukraine in recent weeks.

“How is the Administration coordinating U.S. government agencies to apply these lessons to shore up potential U.S. vulnerabilities as well as those of our allies and partners?” Markey and Keating wrote to Biden, asking for answers by April 29.",https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-04-05-22/h_bad07cb1d0555831b7114c547866cbc8
