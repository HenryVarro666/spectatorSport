Russian assets to be frozen

EU not cutting Russia off SWIFT for now -source

BRUSSELS, Feb 24 (Reuters) - European Union leaders agreed on Thursday to impose new economic sanctions on Russia, joining the United States and Britain in trying to punish President Vladimir Putin and his allies for unleashing a full-scale attack on Ukraine.

However, the bloc held back from taking the harshest measures sought by Ukraine and split over just how far to take the sanctions, leaving details to be worked out in the coming days.

Leaders of the 27-nation bloc lambasted Putin at an emergency summit in Brussels, with Latvian Prime Minister Krisjanis Karins describing him as ""a deluded autocrat creating misery for millions"".

The EU will freeze Russian assets in the bloc and halt its banks' access to European financial markets as part of what EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell described as ""the harshest package of sanctions we have ever implemented"".

The sanctions will also target Russia's energy and transport sectors among others, and seek to stifle its trade and manufacturing with export controls.

""Our sanctions will hurt the Russian economy in its heart,"" said Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo.

But a sense of powerlessness was tangible after Western failed to to stop a war that they leaders had seen coming.

""We were not successful enough, not decisive enough, to prevent Russia from this step, which is a tragedy for Ukraine, a tragedy for Europe and a tragedy for Russia itself,"" said Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda.

There are differences within the EU over how far to go with sanctions, with countries that would face the biggest economic backlash keen to keep the most severe steps in reserve.

""Hopefully, we will make big strides tomorrow on how these sanctions will look specifically,"" said Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra. ""For the Netherlands, SWIFT is part of the discussion.""

'MASSIVE AND SEVERE CONSEQUENCES'

An EU diplomat said the bloc, like the United States, would stop short of taking steps to cut Russia off from the SWIFT global interbank payments system. read more

Ukraine and the EU's ex-Soviet Baltic states had been pushing to remove Russia from the system. But asked about SWIFT, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said: ""We need to keep sanctions ready for later times.""

Germany has already put approval of the Russian-owned Nord Stream 2 Baltic gas pipeline on ice.

In a statement agreed at the summit, EU leaders said the new round of sanctions ""will impose massive and severe consequences on Russia for its action, in close coordination with our partners and allies"".

Russian assets in the EU would be frozen and Russian banks' access to Europe's financial markets would be blocked.

An EU diplomat said Italy, Germany and Cyprus were among those that preferred a step-by-step approach, while central European and Baltic states - those closest to Russia - wanted a harder stance.

""Russia needs to feel that the price of aggression is significant,"" said Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa, wearing a tie with the Ukrainian flag's yellow and blue colours.

The EU had already approved a first round of sanctions on Wednesday, including blacklisting Russian politicians and curbing trade between the EU and two breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine whose independence Moscow has recognised. read more

The EU will also prepare a new aid package for Ukraine and new sanctions against Belarus, used by some of the Russian invaders to enter Ukraine.

Separately, the bloc also promised support to Moldova, another ex-Soviet republic where a pro-Western government is at odds with its former overlord Moscow.

""If he (Putin) can attack Ukraine, it could be any other European country. The democratic ideas, if they were to get to Russia, they would overturn his government. He is fighting for power,"" said Latvia's Karins.

Europe’s reserves stand at just 30 percent, and Europeans are already paying exorbitant prices for energy.

The conflict is occurring when supplies of both oil and natural gas have been tight for months, driving up prices.

“There are serious concerns” that Moscow will tighten exports further and send prices higher, said Helima Croft, head of commodities at RBC Capital Markets, an investment bank.

Germany, Russia’s largest trading partner in Europe, gets 55 percent of its supply from Russia. Italy, the second-biggest trading partner, gets 41 percent. At a forum in Milan last week, the Russian ambassador Sergey Razov said President Vladimir V. Putin had told the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, that “if Italy needs more gas we are ready to supply it.”

Mr. Putin also made a point of saying that roughly 500 Italian businesses have operations in Russia and that bilateral investments are worth $8 billion.

Austria, Turkey and France are large consumers of Russian natural gas. In central and Eastern Europe, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia are the biggest customers, the Russian energy giant Gazprom said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/25/business/economy/russia-europe-sanctions-gas-oil.html

The European Union will block Russia’s access to critical technology and other markets as punishment for Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, European President Ursula von der Leyen said Thursday.

Von der Leyen made a brief public appearance to announce the new measures just hours after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, sending troops across the border from several directions and bombing targets across the country.

Innocent people, von der Leyen said, “are dying of fear for their lives.”

She vowed the EU would respond forcefully.

“We will target the strategic sectors of the Russian economy by blocking the access to technologies and markets that are key for Russia,” von der Leyen said, reading from a prepared statement. “We will freeze Russian assets in the European Union and stop the access of Russian banks to European financial markets.”

“These sanctions,” she added, “are designed to take a heavy toll on the Kremlin’s interests and their ability to finance war.”

The Commission presented a draft package of measures to ambassadors from EU countries on Thursday morning, according to three diplomats. The package includes export controls on technology — including technology with links to the oil and transport sector — and further sanctions on banks, other entities and individuals, the diplomats said.

However, the package does not include kicking Russia out of the SWIFT international payments system, according to diplomats. Baltic countries have called for such a step but Germany and Italy have been far more hesitant.

“SWIFT is not there for now, it needs a political decision. It’s for leaders to decide,” said one of the diplomats.

Standing next to von der Leyen, top EU diplomat Josep Borrell promised the penalties would constitute “the harshest package of sanctions we have ever implemented.”

The new penalties will be presented Thursday evening at an emergency summit of EU leaders.

“We will weaken Russia’s economic base and its capacity to modernize,” von der Leyen said.

The punishment will build on an initial raft of penalties the EU approved Wednesday in response to Russia’s initial troop deployment into eastern Ukraine’s contested Donbass region. European Council President Charles Michel called the emergency EU leaders’ summit following that decision.

“Russia’s target is not only Donbass, the target is not only Ukraine,” von der Leyen said. “The target is the stability in Europe. And the whole of the international peace order.”

The first round of EU penalties went after several members of Putin’s inner circle, including his defense minister. It also targeted military commanders, prominent media personalities who trumpet Kremlin talking points, banking executives and state-controlled financial institutions.

The penalties overlapped with others imposed by the U.S. and U.K., while going father in some areas.

But the EU and its allies have yet to go after a number of more damaging targets, such as Russia’s lucrative energy sector, or its import of key technologies like semiconductors. Also not yet targeted for sanctions is Putin himself.

“These are among the darkest hours for Europe since the end of World War II,” Borrell said.

EU leaders have agreed to impose ""massive"" sanctions on Russia in areas ranging from finance to transport, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in the early hours of Friday.

Speaking following an emergency summit dedicated to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, von der Leyen declared that ""we will hold the Kremlin accountable.""

""The package of massive and targeted sanctions European leaders approved tonight clearly demonstrates that — it will have maximum impact on the Russian economy and the political elite,"" she said.

The new sanctions will hit five areas: the financial sector, the energy sector, the transport sector, export controls and visa policy, according to the Commission chief.

""This package includes financial sanctions that cut Russia's access to the most important capital markets. We're now targeting 70 percent of the Russian banking market, but also key state-owned companies including the field of defense,"" she said.

The sanctions will increase Russia's borrowing costs and gradually erode its industrial base, according to von der Leyen, who also said Russia's elites will be hit.

When it comes to energy, ""our export ban will hit the oil by making it impossible for Russia to upgrade its oil refineries.""

There will also be a ban on the sale of aircraft, spare parts and equipment to Russian airlines, and limit Russia's access to crucial technologies needed to build semiconductors and other advanced technologies, officials said.

And when it comes to visas, ""diplomats and related groups and business people will no longer have privileged access to the European Union,"" she said.

""Our unity is our strength,"" von der Leyen said. ""The Kremlin knows this and it has tried its best to divide us, but it has utterly failed. It has achieved exactly the opposite,” she said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Commission president said, ""is trying to subjugate a friendly European country and he's trying to redraw the maps of Europe by force. He must — and he will — fail.""

The detailed sanctions package is expected to be approved by EU ambassadors on Friday morning and is then rubber-stamped by foreign ministers in the afternoon.",https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-council-summit-sanctions-russia-ukraine-euco/

National security aides had already been huddling in the West Wing on Wednesday evening, preparing for what US officials had warned was a looming assault on Ukraine, when Putin's speech began airing on Russian television around 9:45 p.m. ET.

Appearing before dawn in Russia, the speech came as a surprise.

At the United Nations, Ambassador Linda Thomas Greenfield had spoken by phone to Biden in the moments prior to her remarks at an emergency session of the Security Council. He asked her “to convey in the strongest possible terms his -- and our -- steadfast support for Ukraine,"" she said around 9:45 p.m. ET -- almost exactly the same time as Putin's address.

Her speech didn't reflect the major development that Putin had officially announced the invasion. Photos from the room show her texting with the Ukrainian delegate, saying she ""wished I had the news before I ended my remarks.""

At the White House, Biden convened a secure phone call with top military brass Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan.

Just past 10 p.m. ET, activity in the West Wing briefly came to a halt as televisions tuned to CNN showed teams reporting hearing explosions in Kyiv and Kharkiv, hurriedly donning their protective gear and helmets.

In their offices, Sullivan and other aides worked on drafting Biden's initial statement declaring Russia's actions ""unprovoked and unjustified"" and vowing ""the world will hold Russia accountable."" Biden's statement came through at 10:25 p.m. ET.

Roughly an hour later, a request came in from Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky to speak with Biden, who was eager to get him on the phone. Earlier in the day, officials took note of Zelensky's public concerns, including declaring a state of emergency and mobilizing military reservists, believing it was first time he had conveyed publicly the concerns they have discussed privately for weeks.

On their call, which lasted approximately 10 minutes, Zelensky asked Biden to ""call on the leaders of the world to speak out clearly against President Putin's flagrant aggression, and to stand with the people of Ukraine.""

As Biden was speaking to Zelensky, his aides were also on the phone to Europe as they prepared to announce what one official described as the ""full scale"" of sanctions, which could include export controls, restrictions on large banks and blocks on members of Putin's inner circle.

Biden starts Thursday with additional briefings before attending a virtual session of the G7, where the sanctions will be discussed among the world's leading industrialized nations.

And at noon, Biden will speak to the American people from the White House.
